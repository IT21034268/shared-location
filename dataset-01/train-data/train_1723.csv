1,Clutch broken,"My roommate has the earlier model (SmartPower 5 spd; CB-9). I was blending some fruit and the clutch snapped. Now I need to fix the clutch or buy him a new blender.Looking over the other reviews, I'll do him the favor of replacing it with another brand."
1,GET A KITCHEN AID!,"As another review said, I had the clutch assembly (the black plastic teeth on the base) shatter during use. Customer service sent me the wrong part, then charged me to send it back and send the correct part. Now that I get it, I find that it's not something I can put on myself, I need a technician to do it and have to be charged again to send it back and get it fixed and ""they won't know how much it costs to fix until they actually fix it"" It's not a sturdy blender and not helpful customer service. I'll be replacing it with the pink Kitchen Aid. It will be worth the extra money to have the piece of mind."
1,Garbage,"After less than a year of very infrequent use, the black plastic drive gear (clutch) broke. Like others, called their Customer Service, they want me to pay to fix it and it is within a warranty! Never again. This blender is a real POS! DO NOT BUY IT!!!!"
2,Great for a year and a half,"Have used this blender for about a year and a half and loved it - I never put ice in it so I can't vouch for its success with ice, but I made (non-frozen) smoothies and blended soups in it frequently. Nothing that made it work that hard. Loved the glass pitcher and easy cleaning. However, the motor has clearly gone now - it still whirrs, but has no oomph whatsoever. Tried to blend pineapple juice with a fresh chopped banana last night and it couldn't do it. Sadly, from the other reviews it sounds like going the customer service route is pointless. Guess I'm out the $50. Next time I'll check reviews instead of buying the sale item - I thought Cuisinart was a safe bet."
1,Don't Buy This Blender!!!!,"I purchased this blender 1 year ago and used it very infrequently. Today it began to malfunction; the blade would not turn but the motor was running. When I turned the blender on briefly to see if the base spinning, the black plastic ""clutch assembly"" shattered almost taking my eye out. I called customer service to explain the problem and the rep immediately identified the defective piece as the clutch assembly and was told to send back the base with a $10 shipping fee. This blender is not worth the high price charged. It seems to have a manufacturing defect and you be charged for shipping the product both ways if your's breaks, except in California. Stay away from this blender."
2,"Good. Uh, when it works.","We've had our blender for a couple years. Use it occasionally. That's why it was disappointing when it didn't blend one day. Turns out the plastic clutch that engages the blade was broken. (Notice that the clutch is offerred here at Amazon. Is that because it tends to break?) While the part is cheap, we'll probably have to send it back to Cuisinart for the actual repair. Sorry, gang - not good engineering, either to have a flimsy part or to have one that breaks and has to go back to the repair shop when it does."
2,Big Void,"This blender replaced a Sunbeam I had for 30 years. The jar is oversized and supported by small blades placed in a small opening at the base of vessel, isolated from the mass inside. It takes forever to blend anything smooth. After operating the motor for more than a few moments it begins to emit a strong burning smell. The plastic drive assembly for the blades snapped off in the first week of use. Cuisinart replaced one free. The second one cost about twenty dollars. I would not recommend this blender, there are better choices."
1,Broke down after 1 a few months,"Like other folks, I had problems with this blender. The ""clutch"" that drives the blades broke into pieces after a few months. Dealing with Cuisinart's customer service was enough to make me buy another brand forever. There is a model sold with the food processor unit and I noticed that people have written negative reviews with the same problem that I had. Do yourself a favor, buy another brand."
1,it caught on fire,"I was looking for a blender with enough power to make hummus and a nice enough blade to make smooth smoothies. I used it twice. Once to make hummus, which was successful only when I stopped the blender to move the food around, and a second time to make a smoothie. Milk, Apple juice, 4 Strawberries and a frozen banana--and while I was mixing these rather light items--the motor caught on fire and little flames lept out the vents on the bottom of the blender. The circuit breaker flipped before I could unplug the thing. It smelled awful. Needless to say, the belnder will be returned. I have only had it for 4 days for crying out loud. I am very disappointed."
1,cheeeeep,"First time I used it, the drive gear that powers the blades dissintegrated. Now I am searching Quisinart's Web pages for a replacement... they list most all of the other parts for the unit EXCEPT THAT ONE! Guess I'll just throw it on the dung heap."
1,One day it just would not turn on.....,Inexpensive blender and it shows. Had it for about 2 years and then one day it just would not turn on. In the trash.
1,It may blend but it doesn't chop or puree.,"I don't make smoothies but instead use my blender to make soups, sauces and purees. This blender doesn't chop or puree, even with its seven speeds. I have tried all of those speeds, pulsing on and off but the food just sits there with the added liquids. Look for my blender at your neighborhood Goodwill store, it's the black one that has hardly been used."
1,PLEASE! Save your money.,"I purchased this blender to make food for my sick dog. She was diagnosed with Megaesophagus and all her food must be pureed. Just trying to blend together soft, pate' type canned dog food, water, chicken broth and canned pumpkin causes this blender to shut down 2 to 3 times while my poor dog sits whining by my side.I'm here today to read reviews on other blenders and decided to warn anyone who was thinking of purchasing this one.For the time being, I'll grab a cheap one from a local store. Anything has to be better than this.Customer service at Cuisinart is a joke. They couldn't care less."
1,Very disappointed - twice with this appliance,"We bought the blender to make smoothies - nothing very taxing. After a few weeks the motor failed and we mailed it back to Cuisinart and they sent us a new blender - no questions asked. Now, ( few months later) the motor failed again. We aren't going to waste time and money to mail it back again! We will purchase another blender, but not the same make!!! Very disappointed in the appliance."
1,love the smell of burning motor in the morning,"I was excited about this blender, seemed well designed and powerful enough for everyday needs. The first time I used it, I could smell the motor burning after about 5 seconds. The second time I used it, it shorted out attempting to blend some frozen fruit with yogurt and plenty of liquid. So surprised that Cuisenart made something of such poor quality. That was the last time I used it ;)"
1,"""Smells like something is burning""","I've had the blender for a few years to only to make milk shakes & smoothies (crushed ice). Total use is about a half dozen times. Used it yesterday for a milk shake and within seconds, the blender smelled like something was burning. The fact that it doesn't blend well to begin with, plus the feeling a fire is about to start in the kitchen....Don't buy!"
2,Wish I had done my research..,"I should have done more reading before adding this to my registry! I really thought I would be impressed, seeing as it's substantial in weight.CONS: the lid doesn't completely go on the unit, it's insanely loud, there is little to no difference in blending speeds for each setting, did I mention that it's heavy?, I could ""puree"" or ""liquefy"" for minutes on end and still have frozen chunks, it may hold 40 oz. but don't even try to blend that much - you'll get a messPROS: It blends soft fruits and items well, and that's about all.Search elsewhere for a good blender!"
1,Worst blender ever...,"I purchased this model cuisinart blender 3 years ago. After 1 use, the motor seized and I had to return it. I have used it less than 20 times to only blend soup. This week, while making potato soup with soft, cooked potatoes, and the pitcher with lots of liquid in it...it seized again. This blender should have been able to make smoothies with ice...CHOPPING ICE should have been possible...and it seized while blending diced, cooked potatoes with soup stock in it. BUYER BEWARE...DO NOT PURCHASE. The warranty was good for 3 years...sadly, mine is just over 3 years old. I wont be buying another cuisinart blender."
1,Crap,"I've had one of these for about 3 years. I've now gone through three different cutting tools. Every 10 to 15 months it's seals seem to erode and the tool freezes up. The first time this happened it burned out the motor. The unit was replaced under warranty, but the tool once again became impossible to move about 12 months later, now it's happened again after another 14 months. These things aren't razor blades. I've written to the company multiple times and they've done nothing about this design flaw. Total crap!"
5,still running strong after three years,"I am so happy we registered for this blender. It is nice to have it in a pretty color, and after three years of almost daily use, it still works like the day we got it. Which is awesome!"
1,Plastic Gears do not last - poor customer service,"We have had this blender for a few years without much use. Just recently started using it daily for protein shakes ( ice,frozen strawberries, bananas etc). After a month of daily use we started to notice a funny electrical smell coming from the base. Also the plastic gears are shredding. There are small plastic pieces coming off the gears. I called customer service and they told me the product only has a limited warranty 3 years. Since i don't have the receipt (it was a gift) and i never registered the product, I have no proof of warranty. I have to ship it to them at my cost and after it is shipped they will let me know how much it costs for the repair. I can't believe that this product is still for sale! Who makes a blender with plastic gears??"
1,crap! so sad!,"I got this as a wedding gift, and like many kitchen gifts, it stayed tucked away until recently. I now have 2 kids and stay home and need the use of this all the time... and it is HORRIBLE! I HATE THIS PRODUCT SO MUCH!! It cannot handle breaking up ice for smoothies, I have to constantly turn off the machine and stir up everything inside of it. The only thing I have found that it works well for is when I make squash soup and all the ingredients have already been cooked and are soft. Please save yourself the time and money and just pass on this p.o.s. product!! Oh, and yeah, it TOTALLY smells like burning when you use it... scares me. This is going in the trash... hmm... now!"
1,straut@rof.net,"The blender looks great and worked great for about 4 months but then the drive broke. I don't think it should be considered a ""heavy duty"" model."
1,Plastic Indeed!,"After 60 days of occasional (once a week) use to make smoothies, the all-plastic gears shattered! We've replaced with the Waring.Also, this model seemed to struggle with mixing thicker liquids. If you want to mix a banana with OJ, put the OJ in first."
2,Looked Higher Quality Than it Was,"I ordered this Cuisinart blender, but was disappointed. I expected from the look and ""chrome"" finish that it would be more solid. Instead the base was flimsy plastic and the glass blender carafe seemed to make it top heavy and potentially unstable. I expected higher quality from Cuisinart, but maybe should have been tipped off by the low price..."
1,Smart Power - not!,"Don't be fooled by the nifty SmartPower feature or the solid build. This blender is garbage. We loved the solid build but when we tried to crush ice or make a frozen drink, the blender runs for about half the time needed, about 20 seconds, then the SmartPower protection kicks in and shuts it down. Also, the 15 minute reset time is a joke. Ours didn't reset for at least 45 minutes to an hour. Any brand has to be better than this one. Guess we'll try Oster next."
2,disappointed,"I just started making smoothies for the kids in the morning. It's been about two, maybe 3 months. I've had to order parts on two separate occasions already. The first time it cost $20, this time $10 and I can see that the wheel that makes the thing spin is cracked so I'll be replacing that soon. It's not that much money but the darned thing only costs $60 and you have all this wait time until the parts ship to your house. It's been a pain. With a name like Cuisinart, you expect it to be good. Maybe I should have purchased an Oster at a drug store down the street!"
1,Disappointed,"I bought this for smoothies and used it about 20 times before the motor burned out, the day after the 1-year warranty expired. I had a similar experience with $100 Cuisinart coffee maker. No more Cuisinart in my house."
1,Cuisinart Blender is a Piece of Crap,Paid $80 for this blender. I used it for 2 months then it just died. All we did is make smoothies with it. What a piece of crap. Never again will I buy a Cuisinart!
1,Disappointed!,"We were given this as a wedding gift 3.5 years ago. We rarely used it (maybe half a dozen times?), but when we did it seemed to work ok. We just started using it to make baby food and the motor started smoking on us...we've used it less than a dozen times and it's no longer under warranty! For this kind of money with all the options it seems like a good deal...but BUY SOMETHING ELSE!"
1,Not good for smoothies,"We received this as a wedding gift almost 3 years ago. I love the glass jar part of it but overall as a blender it really disapoints me. We mainly use it to make smoothies. It ALWAYS gets stuck... ALWAYS. Even if all we through in there is frozen berries, frozen yogurt and OJ. It simply is not strong enough for smoothies- hence why I only give it one star. It also failed to blend baby food to super smooth and also failed to finely chop slices of bread into breadcrumbs. We are currently shopping for a new blender that can make smoothies since that is the main reason why we even own a blender."
1,Do not go near this blender,I have owned this blender for two years. It is aweful. Want to make a smoothie? Hope you have time to push the mixture into the blades for 20 minutes. And I hope you like big chucks of fruit in there because it won't blend them.The blender has a funnel shape into the blades preventing anything you want to blend from touching them. I have been waiting to to save up money for a high end blender but will likely have to try another $50 model. But I am not even bringing this blender to goodwill. It will go in the trash where it belongs.
4,good performance,So far this seems to be a good blender. My son likes the ice crushing mode and it blends banana chunks pretty well. I chose this model for its glass pitcher and really like the pour spout as well. The base feels like thin plastic although the modern materials are probably strong enough to allow thinness. I'm just used to my 18 year old Kitchen-Aid which has a much more substantial plastic base to the pitcher.
1,Terrible Product!!!,"We only use this blender occasionally for smoothies and it's always emitted a burnt rubber smell. My cousin told me that he had the same model, it also emitted a burnt rubber smell and eventually died. Mine still worked despite the smell. Today, I was making a smoothie and the smell got extremely bad. When I opened up the lid, puffs of smoke were coming out of the unit. I had to throw the smoothie out (which was only milk and banana) because the smoke ""traveled"" through the liquid to escape. This unit is going in the garbage and I will not be purchasing a Cuisinart again. Sad... I always thought this was supposed to be one of the better brands."
1,Wish I could give this No stars,WORST BLENDER EVER. Blends nothing. Can't chop ice. Tried to make pesto and had to switch to my food processor instead. Don't waste any money on this horrible piece of crap.
4,no charge to order replacement cutter assembly,"Today I found my Cuisinart duet blender cutter assembly was cracked! It was 4 mo. old and I had used it very few times. I called customer service (800-726-0190); my call was immediately answered by an agent. In 3-1/2 minutes, I had ordered a replacement cutter assembly at no cost to me! I am very happy with with Cuisinart's excellent customer service."
2,this blender is overpriced,"We thought we were investing in a decent blender but after only 2 years of limited use, the black gear piece cracked, rendering the whole blender useless!"
4,Very good blender,"Bought this blender after the last one died. I didn't realize how wimpy the old one was until I got this one. My smoothies are no longer lumpy! Plastic lid, glass pitcher,plastic bottom ring. The only thing I'm not thrilled with is the the plastic fitting at the bottom. It's a large piece of rigid plastic that I'm afraid will crack or discolor. And, since the color is 1/2 the reason I chose this one, I would hate to see the pink fade."
1,Do you like chunky smoothies?,"I have owned this blender for 6 years and have been disappointed with it for...oh...6 YEARS. Cuisinart should have put more money into creating a functional machine instead of making it look pretty.Main complaint: can't handle frozen fruit of any magnitude. Try throwing a couple frozen strawberries in your smoothie and a few wheezes later, the Cuisinart has produced a runny, sad looking beverage with...what's this? STRAWBERRY ICE CUBES!Save your money! I can't wait to replace my model!"
1,Nice Looks and Worked Decent... Temporarily,"This one sure worked better than the Kitchen-Aid that I returned, but it doesn't mix evenly and smooth. I found out the hard way that it costs $30 plus to replace the glass jar as I accidentally tapped the bottom on the counter while cleaning it and up the side a crack went. Finally, after about 1-1/2 years of very occasional use making smoothies and soups, the motor is pouring out smoke and leaving bits of plastic on the countertop. I seriously don't believe I've been hard on the blender, but after maybe only 20 uses, I've concluded this was a mistake to buy. Also, the white plastic fades to a milky yellow if you leave it on the countertop and your kitchen gets sun."
3,electrical smell,"Started off okay, but after 10 or 20 uses the motor is starting to make that tired, electrical smell. You know the one. The one that suggests it's either about to burst into flames or give up the ghost. I'll have to watch and see. Maybe it's nothing. I had another one just like it before and it worked great for many years. We'll see."
2,Blender great; Processor not so great,"I love the blender portion. It works great at crushing ice and other items. The food processor is another story. Works to chop up and blend items, but the motor noise alone has forced me to stop using it. With each use, the noise is louder and so irritating. I am extremely disappointed that I can't use the processor portion of it. As much as I love the blender, I can't recommend the purchase because you won't be able to use the processor without ear plugs."
1,Piece of crap.,"I probably have used this blender 6 or 7 times. I wanted to make a smoothie for breakfast this morning and it broke. I was very surprised and disappointed. Yes, it is the same part that everyone else seems to have a problem with, the clutch assembly, cracked while trying to chop frozen berries. I thought about getting a replacement clutch assembly but since reading these reviews I don't think I will bother. I guess I will just get a different blender altogether."
1,Piece of junk,"I was thoroughly disappointed with this blender, which labors to make a milkshake and cannot even puree a banana + a few frozen strawberries in fruit juice. Although it had been 8 months since purchased and I couldn't find the receipt, I took it back to Linens N Things and begged for a store credit which they were kind enough to provide. Definitely going for the Oster next!"
1,Leaking around rubber ring on two models,"My first Cuisinart blender leaked out the bottom, no matter how hard I tightened it to secure the rubber ring/gasket. It suddenly stopped working altogether after a few months- no power. I paid the shipping on a replacement, same model. The second Cuisinart leaks out the bottom just like the first. The base is poorly designed to tightly hold the rubber ring/gasket in proper position and in my two cases, impossible to tighten enough to prevent a leaking blender. I put it in my garage sale with a big ""Warning- Leaks"" sign and price of $1.00. (It isn't too bad for thick drinks like milk shakes if you pour them out quickly before the ice cream melts). I now use a $19.00 Wal-Mart blender that works great and doesn't leak- no more sticky drink juice on the counter!"
1,The Blender That Can't Blend,"I concur with the other bad reviews here. It can be used as a stirrer (but then again, so can a spoon and that's a bit cheaper), but beyond that, it can't actually blend anything--the blades just carve out a spot at the bottom and whir around while the food sits on top motionless (unless you spend 20 minutes shoving the food down and stirring and adjusting, etc.) And ever since the first use, I've smelled a burning motor smell every time I use it. The lack of a decent pour spout assures major spillage at every pour. Who makes a blender without a pour spout? Save your money and please don't buy this. Cuisinart should do a recall and the reason should be ""atrocious design."""
2,Not good for smoothies,"I am a huge smoothie addict. Love making them in the morning for breakfast and after a workout. So I was excited when I received this blender as a Christmas present. It looks beautiful and is from a great brand name. But I could hardly be more disappointed. The blender simply does not completely blend the frozen fruit I use to make my smoothies. No matter how much liquid I add, how long I run the blender, or what speed I run it at, there are always chunks of un-blended fruit waiting for me to bite. It doesn't work nearly as well as the cheap Oster blender I bought years ago at Walgreens (which finally burned out)."
1,It did not last after less than 10 uses,"Motor Just burned out making pina coladas on xmas while entertaining guests. How embarassing! Bought this in the summer for smoothies. Do not buy!!!!!!!! The company offers to fix but I have to pay shipping, no replacement plan. I know this will burn out again once it is fixed. My prior blender lasted more than 10 years and still worked. I replaced it because the plastic container cracked. I thought I was upgrading to a modern high tech model, what a joke. I prefer 10 years not 10 uses..."
2,not what I though,"this blender is not up to the Cuisinart name. while it may be very pretty, it is very loud and not as powerful as others that I have had in the past."
1,Cuisinart Customer Service is TERRIBLE!,"I had purchased this blender a little over a year ago. The white plastic collar cracked. I called Cuisinart about replacing it. They charged me $6.95 (no big deal).Then started the wait. I waited for two months. Still no part. I called Cuisinart 3 times and was told the part was on backorder. After almost three months they shipped it. When I received the package it was the WRONG part! I called customer service again and was told that they were sorry and would send out another one. Two weeks later, still nothing. I called AGAIN. This time I received it about a week later. In the mean time I purchased a Kitchenaid blender (I LOVE it). I will NEVER buy Cuisinart again."
1,Terrible!,"For this money I didn't expect the glue under the button names to peel up within a week. and I certainly didn't expect the base to cause messy leaks despite repeatedly replacing the gaskets. And now, after less than two years the motor has burned out! Shame on you Cuisinart!"
3,Janice's subliminal projects,I tried crushing ice in this the first time and thought maybe I had too much ice in it because it didn''t crush well. I tried it again with much less ice and the ice swirled around in the bottom and crushed some but I still had small chunks of ice when I was finished.
1,Don't buy it,"The first time I used this blender, it smelled like it was burning up. All I was trying to make was a smoothie. I tried it again the next day and the same thing happened. I am returning it. Save yourself the trouble and don't buy it in the first place."
2,Burned out after a year of use,"I used this blender to make smoothies from frozen fruit, yogurt, milk, and so on. I typically used it twice a week for about a year and two months. About six months in, its motor started smelling of hot varnish, which is a clear sign of a stressed motor. It did a good job while it lasted, but seems a bit underpowered for the price and not much better than a $20 blender from KMart, except that it's nicer to have glass than plastic."
1,Broke after 2 months--Customer service awful,"I wish I had read these reviews before I bought mine! It died tonight as I made a smoothie. I can see the loose washer through the vents in the base. I too was told by a surly Customer Service rep that it would be $10 to ship it, and he said there was no supervisor available to speak with. WIll never buy Cuisinart again."
5,A great blender in all respects,"I've had this blender for about a year now, and use it regularly to make smoothies or soups. The 'digital' control panel seemed a little gimicky at first, but I've learned to appreciate the easy cleanup that it allows with a sponge. The wide openings of the heavy glass jar (which is much sturdier than most) allow for easy cleaning and pouring, and the motor has more than enough power for everything I've thrown at it.My only complaint is that the rubber lid stained when I blended some hot tomato soup in it. The instruction manual warns against blending hot liquids however, and the stain is purely cosmetic and on the inside of the lid where it isn't visible. The plastic base of the jar also seems like it would be prone to snapping over time, but in my frequent use of the blender I haven't had any troubles with it.Overall I would highly recommend this blender over the cheaper alternatives, the heavy glass jar, sharp blade and powerful motor make it a joy to use."
2,Plastic,"I just got this yesterday from Amazon. I was so excited opening it...then my hopes were dashed. This thing is 100% plastic! I have not decided whether I'm going to return it or not, but be aware...that cool chrome look is exactly that, a look...and you can tell without touching it--just a little too shiny. The pitcher bottom is black plastic along with a plastic top...it's so full of plastic it hardly weighs anything...in other words, it feels cheap. For $100 bucks I'm very disapointed. The contols will be easy to clean if I keep it though."
4,Not As Advertised,"Great blender, but I warn you against using it for ice crushing. I had to replace three blade assemblies withing a six month period. I bought a Kitchen Aid, which has heavy duty blades and works well for ice crusing, but doesn't blend nearly as well as the Cuisinart. Also, the blade assembly in the K A has now given out, but its been doing yeoman service for a year. I've just bought a Waring SPB2 and so far, it crushes ice and a good job of blending, if you do both at the same time. Its container is a bit narrow for straight ice crusing. In that reagard, the K A is superior. Bottom line: using the Waring, holding the other two in reserve, just in case."
1,A Beautiful Underperformer,"This blender has features to recommend it IF did not have a documented history of breaking. The clutch unit that engages the blade is plastic and breaks . . . frequently.The digital control pad is easy to clean, no more using a cotton swab to clean between buttons. Except for the previously mentioned clutch unit, the blender is very well made. It seemed to labor when blending milkshakes or smoothies.Overall, the blender worked in an acceptable manner before it broke. It was only used about 15 times before the clutch disintergrated.I am replacing the Cuisinart with an Oster Beehive, which has an all metal drive unit."
2,"Worked for a few years, then burn city","I loved this when I purchased it, then I noticed it did not do a perfect job, then it would take a while to get going, then it smoked and died. Not worth it."
4,it looks great and works even better,"I've had this blender for over a year now and it has yet to let me down. It looks great, and is a snap to use. The panel is easy to clean. In addition, the base comes apart into several pieces so that it can be cleaned easily without leaving any `gunk' behind. I've never had any problem with ice; this thing just chews it up! The wide range of controls is a plus because I use this thing for everything, from pureed vegetables for soups to milk shakes. A definite recommend."
1,"Nice design, poor quality motor","I purchased one of these (not Amazon) but it stopped working after less than three weeks of daily use (one Herbalife shake twice a day). I took it to the store for replacement. The second one lasted around 2 weeks and the motor failed too, so I returned it and asked my money back. It looks very well designed, the jar and lid are top quality and the blade used to work very well, however the motor (the most important part) makes the whole thing a waste of money. Too bad a reputable brand like Cuisinart uses such low quality motors."
1,"Horrible blender, terrible customer service","I have owned two of these blenders and within 6 months of having each, the clutch assembly shredded. After the issue happened with the first, I had not retained the info on the purchase so couldn't return the product. I bought a second (same model) and the same issue happened within a few months. Upon contacting Cuisinart customer service, I received a ""blanket"" type response stating that the blender needed a new clutch and I could purchase one and install it myself. I reiterated the fact that this was the second blender where the same issue had taken place and pressed upon the fact that it was obviously a common design flaw. I was once again directed to purchase the clutch assembly and install myself. I will never buy another Cuisinart product! Seems the reviews here echo the same."
1,Useless.,"My husband bought me this blender for Christmas because I became frustrated with our old one - gear was shearing off. So, out of the box...put in some ice cream and milk...press the button and....nothing. The mixture in the very bottom of the jar was whirling around, but that's it. Like my old blender, I had to stop it and smash the ice cream down with a spoon every 10 seconds. I tried to make pesto - same thing. A waste of money."
4,Make it Stop!,"This machine will blend anything! It beat my KitchenAid hands down in that department. The problem is the noise the machine produces on every cycle. It's as loud as an outboard motor. We are afraid of receiving complaints in our condominium when blending our morning smoothies! Seriouly folks, a pair of earplugs should be included in every box."
1,Piece of Junk,I bought the Cuisinart 7 speed blender because of their reputation for quality however since using this blender less than a dozen times the plastic blender drive clutch broke.I spent $59 for this POS that does not work because of broken 5 cent piece of plastic.I will never buy another Cuisinart product and urge you not to .
2,"So far, so good","I just got this blender and it works much better than the Osterizer that I replaced. I mostly use it for smoothies and it works great, no need to stir by hand or push the ice down, just put in the ingredients and let it rip. Consumer Reports rates this blender highly (the highest of any with touch pad controls). I just found the other reviews about reliability, I'm hoping for better luck. (Oops, it quit working after 2 months)"
2,Wouldn't recommend,"I purchased this model in chrome based on brand name four years ago. We make a lot of frozen drinks, and the spout would never pour right, with liquid running down the side into the jar base. Then when you would pick it up to pour the next time, it would pour out of the base unexpectedly and make a drippy mess. You always had to hold a towel at the base with one hand when pouring (very inconvenient). Eventually the touchpad went out, and it was a relief to see it go. How sad that a poorly designed spout ruined an otherwise great product."
4,Great Blender,"This is a great Blender. I have read reviews here that state that they were dissapointed that it was plastic. If it would have came with true chrome metal it would have became discolored in no time due to the fact that it gets wet so much. This is a great blender, it crushed ice very well, and it doesn't bog down when I blend thick things such as shakes, etc. . . I am very satisfied with this blender, and will consider Cuisinart items in the future."
5,Dustins Useless Review,"Unloco is one of the best bands out, and there CD proves it. It has some of the best songs in rock, especialy one of there most requested song 'i' If you like Slipknot, Stained, or any other good rock/metal band you will like Unloco as well."
2,eh...,"OK so, 1st of all, the item was listed as having THREE play's to work with. It arrived and we didn't actually open it until it was too late (my bad!) to return it. It only came with TWO play's and the one missing is Romeo & Juliet, the ONE play that is worth playing the game for. Hamlet and Othello are WAY too advanced for most people to get excited about the game. I'm going to gift the game to an actor friend in Europe who has been in a 100's of Shakespeare plays, but I am terribly disappointed by this game and the seller. The game is complicated too. I suppose one could simply take the cards and make their own game, but, then why bother buying the game? I can't find Midsummer Night's Dream cards too, which exist. That might change the quality of the game being my fave Shakes-play."
4,Good Value for Good Music,"First of all, it is the rare box set that will earn five stars ... especially one with a whopping 45 tracks! However, this set come pretty close. And, unlike other box dance/techno sets, this is 3 CDs of tracks--no ""megamix"" here! The three CDS have some well-known gems on it scattered thoughout, such as Fat Boy Slim's ""Bird of Prey"" and the ubiquitous Moby's ""Why Does My Heart Feel So Bad."" But along with those tracks you will find 43 other songs that, while they may be less well-known to American audiences, are consistently good. I've played the set through 3-4 times and haven't ever raced to pick up the remote and skip a track. There's nothing too trance-y, nothing down-beat, nothing with obnoxious-nerve-grating effects.If you are looking for a good collection of dance tracks, you can do a lot worse than this set."
2,not as good as whyte's later poetry [for me],This selection of Whyte's poems is clearly early; not as distilled and powerful as his later work. My favourite collection is still House of Belonging!
5,Soup,"I have just finished reading the book Soup. I loved the book. It delt with two third graders and how they always got into troule. The main characters are: Robert, Soup, mamma, aunt Carrie, Mrs. Stetson, and Mr. Diskin.Some things they did was break the church window, cheat Mr. Diskin, and smoke corn.This is truley one of the best books I have ever read in my life!"
5,avid reader,"It was easy to get my daughter to read, I just remembered all of my favorite childhood authors. Then I taught my first son to read, he wasn't interested. These books keep him engaged. Soup is old-fashioned fun"
4,"Hilarious, side wrenching view of youth.",I first checked this book out of the library when I was about 12 for a road trip I would be taking with my family. My mom ended up reading the book outloud to us all in the car and we laughed clear through the state of Texas. It was pure unadulterated fun that sure helped the time go by.
1,absolutely pointless and dull,"i thought this would be an exciting book. i kept reading and reading waiting to get to the good part, but i never did. i found it boring and had no point! i wouldn't even consider looking at the sequel."
5,Awesome Book,"This book was great! I love history, esp. the Revolutionary War, so ""My Brother Sam Is Dead"" fit well. The book really took me with it through the story. It did a good job of explaining the everyday life of the Americans, to the everyday life of the soldiers(american and british). I strongly recommend this book!"
3,A wake-up call to people who think war is all fun and games,"I am a 7th grader, and I read this book awhile ago. It was really pretty good, and delivered a somewhat shocking image of war (kind of like how I hear ""Saving Private Ryan"" is), and gave me a wake up call.This book builds up some excitement, but the ending is horrible. A do not reccomend this book to anybody who enjoys happy endings, but otherwise, look into it."
3,Pretty historically accurate,My Brother Sam is Dead is pretty good for being a book for young adults. It isn't very hard to read and tells an individual story of the Revolutionary War. This book isn't bad.
1,I wish I had never read this book!!!,"My Brother Sam is Dead I think is half good and half bad. The bad part of the story is the beginning because it just tells you about the family and nothing much happens. After a while the book starts to get a little better. The kidnapping of Tim's dad was intense and scary. The book also brought feelings of sadness because Tim's life was so effected and changed by the war. Wondering if Sam is going to really be executed kept me reading this book. This book is worth a read.""A Reluctant Reader"""
4,My Brother Sam Is Dead,I just finished my author's book and it was a really good book because it includes a lot of action. I learned in the book that the Revolutionary War was a hard time because families turned against each other and broke up. In the book Tim Meeker finds out that his brother died in the Revolutionary War. He feels guilty about his brothers death because he fought against his brother in the war. If you like history this is a good book for you.
1,It had no point and it made me tired and it was boring,I had to read this book for school I brought it home and started it. It was boring from the first page on!!
1,ewww bad get it away,"I had to read this book for a book report. It was horrible! Now let me get this straight. I love reading I probably read a book a week and usually I love books, but this was horrible. There wasn't a definate plot and the characters weren't that good. The explicit bloody detaails were just too much. This book was just the worst to me. I highly reccomend you find something else to read."
5,Awesome,This is a great book. The conflict is great and the whole book is ravishing. it's the best book I've ever read.
1,HORRIBLE!,"This book is the worst book I ever read. Every second someone died. I had to read this for summer reading at my school. Poor Tim's dad, brother, best friend, and a lot of his neighbor die. This book is disgusting. People's head get's chopped off and they have some inappropriate content. There is also a lot of cursing. Plus this book was written in the 1970's and takes place in the 1770's so it has a lot of older words that I had to look up in the dictionary. This book was just bad. Do not buy this."
3,Tim's Life,This book is about a boy named Tim whose brother named Sam goes to the war. Sam is always trying to argue with his dad and his dad and Sam always get into arguements. Tim is always has to be quiet about the fight and can't tell any one about them. Find out if Sam really dies or they just think that he does. I really thought this book was boring. This book has to do with external conflict because Sam and his dad are always arguing.I put 3 stars because it wasn't the best or the worst book ever.
3,3 star rating: My Brother Sam Is Dead!,"I had to read this book for school. I would say this is a pretty good book but boring on the other hand. My Brother Sam is a story about two brothers who lived back in the days of the Revolutionary war. The oldest brother Sam goes of to fight in the Revolutionary war. The youngest brother is left alone with his mom in Connecticut hoping his brother will come back even after twists and turns they had took earlier in the book. Tim Meeker has to run the tavern his self, also he has to get the new cattle and do all of the chores. I would say this book will challenge minds of all sorts, and what the heck, any time you need something to read, go to your nearest library and pick it up. You might get something out of it!"
1,blarghh,"I hated this book. I'll admit right away that I hate sad books but this really was unbearable. First of all, it would have improved the book somewhat if the title hadn't given away the ending. Not only was I not surprised when Sam was killed, I found myself dreading reading the book. (I had to read it for school) I think that this type of writing shouldn't be encouraged. The real world is horrible enough, why should kids be forced to read tragic literature on it?"
4,A good book.,My Brother Sam is dead was a good book. L liked the book becouse it took place in a setting was very discriptive. I liked the fact that a family in it fought for each other. Even when they disagrea on a lot of topics. The book has a good sence of humer for how seriose the topic of the story. Like when Sam was talking about stealing Old Bess (the gun) wile putting chicken eggs in a basket with holes in the bottom of it. The book is the third most favorite book I read this year. The book cept its carictors vary discriptive and interesting through the hole book. But the oldest sun Sam gets in trubble with the law. He gets exicuted. That was the only part of the story I was not interested in. Since the famaly was so close or becoase he was so nise he didn't even commit the crime.His father tries to help even though they don't always get along all the time.
4,A Super Ultra Mega Bad Review with Krunk Style,"I Thought that this was a very good book in the Climax of the Revolutionary War. It is about a young Tim Meeker who at first is a very normal boy in that time, but one day his brother runs away from home to join the Continental Army. So Tim is stuck with all the chores to do. I could Reflect to this because usually my sister never does any of the chores at home, so I am stuck doing all the chores. A suspenseful part in the book is when Tim and Tim's Father are Driving Cattle to a Northern City,when they are jumped by Cowboys and they are left in the Freezing Cold with Nothing."
3,This was a good book.,"This was a good book, even though the title gave away what happened to Sam. This book had a good beginning and ending, but the plot was boring. This is a very descriptive book."
4,My brother Sam is dead,I love this book it makes sense it is really interesting and awesome I love it love it .it can get sad though
2,My Brother Sam is Dead,"The historical content of My Brother Sam is Dead is wonderful, and it does graphically portray the horrors of war, the difficult choices made, and consequences of choices. It can encourage deep discussion. The profanity is what bothers me most. Sure, our students have heard these words, but must I provide a source for them? If the book left out the profanity I would use it. PLEASE read before giving to students."
3,A little mature for 10-11 year olds,"I think the language - based on what my 5th grader is telling me, is a little unnecessary. She is reading it as a school assignment and is a high-level. We're not prudes or uptight by any means, but it almost seems as if this isn't a ""historical novel"" as much as an ""introduction to curse words"" in the eyes of the young reader. Maybe if I actually read the book, I would find differently - but the point is that the 5th graders are the audience, and what are they taking away from the experience."
3,My Brother Sam Is Dead,"My Brother Sam Is Dead is an okay book that took place during the Revelutionary War. It was written by James and Christopher Collier. It moved a little too slow for me.This book was about a family torn apart by the war. When the dad sides with the Loyalists, and the big brother Sam goes to fight for the Patriots, which side should the little brother go to?This book had many different characters in it. On a scale of one to ten I would give it a six."
1,"idiotic, disappointing, disgusting","This waste of trees and money is depressing beyond anyone's imagination. After I read the book I ripped it up and stuck the largest of the remains on a stick. Everyone who dies in the story dies in bizzare, backfiring ways. This book makes it seem like the Patriots were wrong in breaking away from Britain. If I could, I would rate this -20. Whoever gave this book a Newberry Award was insane."
2,My Brother Sam is Gorry,"In the school year, my teacher made us read my brother sam is dead. I knew it would be sad, but I didn't think it would be as gorry as it was. Chapters 1-8 are pretty good, but Chapters 9 & on were far from it. There is a part where a slave dies and his head falls off. This book also uses a lot of curse words, and that is not good to put in a children's book. Also, when you buy this book, expect to be depressed afterwards. I read the book and that night, I cried and my mom and dad asked what was wrong. They did not think that a book could be that depressing. For some much better literature on wars, (and if you are a girl) get the american girls series with addy. Or, check out documentary books. But what ever you do DON'T READ THE BOOK IF YOU DON""T LIKE THE IDEA OF PEOPLE DYING AND GROSS STUFF!!"
4,The story of Tim Meeker,During the time of the revolutionary war.A boy named Tim Meeker was living a normal life til when his brother Sam came home from college for important reason.To tell his family that he was part of the american army.Tim is left with many problems.Keeping secrets from his father and sneeking message to Sam.Tim never wanted to disobey his father but he doesn't want his brother to die.Tim incoming problems and choices making you read more and more.
1,A terrible Book I was forced to read,I had to read this book for summer reading. Normally I love summer reading becasue I love to read but I hated it this time. I was forced to read my brother sam is dead. I was not interested. I thought it would be about Sam on the battlefield which would be interesting but it was about his brother's boring life. The only good part was the end because then I could stop reading and start a better book.
5,My Brother Sam is Dead,My brother Sam is dead is by far the best book I have ever read even though I m only in eight grade. It is the only book I have ever read twice. It all starts when Sam decides to leave Yale and go join the continental army and fight the lobsterbacks he comes home and steals his father's gun and runs off to join the army leaving his family to take care of the farm and the tavern. But when the war comes home to Redding Ridge it suddenly becomes very real to Sam's little brother Tim that what Sam is fighting for is worth fighting for and there is a war out there. I personally recommend this book to all young readers. Have fun!
4,My Brother Sam Is Dead,"My Brother Sam Is Dead by James Lincoln Collier and Christopher Collier is a good book. It's genre is realistic fiction and its also very exciting.The book has a conflict between Timmy's brother Sam and their father. Timmy is a boy and is the main character. It takes place during the Revolutionary War. Sam goes to fight for the continental army, but father doesn't want him to.I like the book because it is very exciting at times. It is also very factual with the Revolutionary War and historical ways.When I read My Brother Sam Is Dead, I wondered if I would be detirmined enough to do what Tim did. This book shows what it was like to live in the time of the Revolutionary War."
1,not worth it,when i picked up this book i thought that it would end up being good but for some reason i couldn't get through it. The plot was bad and it showed the revolutionary war to be a joke! I hated it!!
2,My Brother Sam is Dead,"The book I have just finished was not something I recommend. I read My Brother Sam is Dead.In this story, the character that stood out the most throughout the book was Tim. This story took place durring the Revolutionary War, which was not a good time for colonistsor anyone really in that time period. Durring this book, Tim's brother, Sam, is in the Army in the colonies, and this makes Tim confused. Time looks up to sam as a soldier, thinking war was all fun and games.As this story moves n, Tim realizes the reality of war ast comes closer to his home and the tavern the family owns. Tim's father and brother draw further apart being that the father was a tory and sam is a colonist fighting for freedom. The differences between tim's father and brother are what make up the moral of this book.I would not recommend this book because the title of the book gave the story away, which was mainly the death of Tim's brother Sam."
3,"Emotionally gritty, parental guidance may be needed","My Brother Sam is Dead is a heart-breaking story of how politics and war can destroy a family. Tim and Sam are from a New England town which strongly supports the British government during the Revolutionary war. When the older boy, Sam, runs away and joins the revolutionaries, the impressionable Tim is left behind to help his parents eke out a living in the war-starved economy. Tim doesn't understand what all the fighting is about, and why his father is so angry at Sam. Tim questions his own loyalties and finally learns what real responsibility is. This book is aimed at 8-12 year old boys. The adventure is exciting enough that kids will enjoy the book on their own (if they like historical adventure). However, the book would be more educational with adult guidance (many kids might not know enough about the revolutionary war to understand the emotional tension of the plot). A warning though: the language is a bit strong for the target audience."
4,My Brother Sam is Dead,"This book is about a young boy named Tim Meeker, and the hardships he comes across during the Revolutionary War. His brother eagerly joins the Rebels in the fight against red coats which causes a string of events to happen that Tim then has to cope with. The characters are all very believable and interesting. The events are exciting and done very well. This book will leave you wanting more. I would reccomend this book to anyone."
4,Cool/sad,This book my brother sam is Dead is a very cool and historici like how it was placed in such a cool time in history. Yet i thought it was sad because nothin really good happend. But i recomend this book to ages 10+
2,hmm...,"i read this book about four years ago, and i remember that i hated it. first of all- the title RUINS the entire story. you know from the beginning of the story that sam is going to die. other than that, the story is rather dull. i most definetely do NOT recommend it."
1,Socio-political propaganda for the left,"No, I'm not a raving crazy conservative. But seriously, it's quite obvious that the point of this book is to teach kids that the revolutionaries were bad too. That may be true, but kids should be learning the rules, not the exceptions. Let them learn the nuances and the exceptions later. On the other hand, if you are of the crowd that thinks that bad Americans was, and is, the rule (e.g. the NEA), than you will love this book. If you want your kids to think the American cause was basically good and noble, let them read this book when they're older."
3,How good is this book,This book is a pretty good book. One thing that I did not like is that Sam dies. Did he have to die. That is not right to ececute someone for stelling his own cows. The rest of it was good. It is a great war book. It is perfect for our age.
3,action packed novel,My Brother Sam is Dead is an action packed emotional novel that takes place durring the Revolutionary War.This book only deserves 3 out of 5 stars because it makes you feel less patriotic because they speak badly of the Continental Army
4,My Brother Sam Is Dead: Picking Sides,"Tim is just a boy with a very bright future depending on his decisions right now in his life. There's only one problem, and it's a big one: the Revolutionary War has come along and Sam, Tim's brother, goes to fight for the Patriots and his father stays loyal to the king. Tim must decide which side he's on. The best parts in the book, I think, are the battles in the war. This was a good book, and that's why I gave it **** stars."
3,A must reader.,My Brother Sam is Dead is a wonderful war recreation.This book has a wonderful ending. The problem is the title tells the ending. I liked this book becase it was very deatailed and extraordinary.
3,My Brother Sam Is Dead!,"I had to read this book for school. I would say this is a pretty good book but boring on the other hand. My Brother Sam is a story about two brothers who lived back in the days of the Revolutionary war. The oldest brother Sam goes of to fight in the Revolutionary war. The youngest brother is left alone with his mom in Connecticut hoping his brother will come back even after twists and turns they had took earlier in the book. Tim Meeker has to run the tavern his self, also he has to get the new cattle and do all of the chores. I would say this book will challenge minds of all sorts, and what the heck, any time you need something to read, go to your nearest library and pick it up. You might get something out of it!"
5,This book was amazing,I was given this book to read for school and I enjoyed itthoroughly. This thrilling saga of a family torn apart by war gets mybiggest and heartiest 5 stars.
4,I really liked this book.,"My Book review is on the book My Brother Sam is Dead. The contents of this book are the sad ending, which was when Sam was killed by his own side and when his father was killed by his own side. The characters in this book are Tim, Sam, Sam's father, and Sam;s side's crew. Tim had a hard time with deciding if he wants to be a loyalist or a patriot. Sam's father argues with sam a lot over which side to be on. In this Historical Fiction Book it tells about the Wars and how the Wars were won.I read this book at home and at school. My 7th/8th grade teacher chode this book for the class to read. She cose the book in the fall of 1999.I liked this book because it told about the wars and how the families took it. I also liked this book because it had a good title.I would compare this Book to the book standing in The Light. If you have to read a Historical fiction Book for a class, read Standing in The Light."
3,My Brother Sam is Dead,Very good book but kind of confusing I would recommend it though ps some bad words but not very much
5,Great historical fiction for an 8th grade boy!,"This got my son more interested in the Revolutionary War period as he studies US History in 8th Grade. If it isn't assigned, have your son read it on his own.."
5,Amazing book!,"This was one of the best books I have read. It's about a little boy named Timothy Meeker, and his hardships and adventures during the Revolutionary War. This book has accurate information on who was there, and if that place was there. The book is focused around the small town of Redding, Connecticut. It including the names of real Continental Officers, and even some real people of lesser significance. I recommend this book to anyone who has any interest at all in the Revolutionary War, or even if you're just looking for a good book."
5,alicia mcrae,in the 7th grade we had to read mbsid ii read it and i thought iy wad good i liked it and would recomend it for oyhrrs to tead
4,good book,Although this book was not my favorite book it was a really good book. I would definatly recomind this book to my friends. I liked the way the authors showed how real the war was and how it had a major effect on families and freinds. I give this book four stars!!!
4,Amazing Story!,"This book is one of the best books I've read all year. I would advise everyone of all ages read this book. Trust me, you wont be disapointed."
4,My opinion of this book,My Brother Sam is dead is not a bad book. In some ways i like it and in other ways i don't. The author wrote this book well and used very figurative language. There were few things wrong and I will not point out all of them. This is a good book and i enjoyed reading it.
4,"A great novel,","Tim's brother Sam comes home one night talking about battles that were recently fought out. He tells his father that he has joined the minute men and is going to fight his first battle soon. Sam says he needs his dad's brown bess but his dad wouldn't give it to him. Sam runs away and comes back to steal it. Soon winter comes and Tim and his father need to get to a nearby town to sell the cattle to buy goods for the tavern. On the way back to the tavern, Tim's father gets kidnapped by British soldiers. He is forced on a prison ship and dies. Can things get any worse for Tim's family? Find out by reading this great novel."
3,"Depressing, Depressing, Depressing,","Okay, I guess I can reveal the end of the book this time: his brother Sam DIES. I really enjoyed this book, but the end is so depressing it ruins the entire book. It just ENDS--cuts off! The author very effectively gets you attached to the main characters, then kills one of them off and never returns to the narrator. We never get a chance to hear the hero's thoughts on his brother's death. This is a very good book with an outstanding plot, but be prepared to be totally shut down at the end. It wasn't an emotional, cry, cry, cry ending; it just completely SHUTS you and the book DOWN."
4,A review by a teenage History Buff,"This book is about a young boy who has grown up in a Tory town all of his life. He is at the age where he begins to wonder if what his father believes is right. Then his big brother Sam leaves to fight for the continental army and Tim cant decide which side to be on. Tim decides that Sam is right because of something that happens to one of his Tory friends, but then something happens to his father to make him think that the British way is right. This book contains a great element of suspense because you can never know what is going to happen next."
4,A family in the Cival War,"I had to read this book because we were learning about the Civil War at school. I will tell you two things about why I liked about the book and two things about what I didn't like about the book.I liked this book because it made me understand that a lot of people died in the Cival War just to make America a free country. I liked the book because it teaches you the importance of forgiveness. Tim is a boy in the book who forgave his brother, Sam for running away and left Tim doing all the work in the family tavern. Tim forgave his brother because he knew he was doing the right thing.The parts of the book I didn't like were the ending and that Sam had to fight in the army for three years and he was acused of stealing cattle. He did not do it but was found guilty and was executed. I didn't like the ending because he just died and the book was over. I would have liked if Tim would have gone back home to see how his mother would have reacted to the news."
3,I only read it in order to pass the class,"I had to read this book for school and wish I hadn't.It was O.K. I'm not going to say it was horrible, but I would never recommend it to anyone, except maybe if your into wars and stuff.I didn't dread having to read it (once I started) but it's not one of those books you can't put down. It does however show a realistic bond between a father and his son, more so, two brothers."
5,"It was sad, couragous, and exciting for all ages","My brother sam is dead was the best book i have ever read. a boy that wanted to be compared to his red-coat brother sam. filled with joy, excitment, sad and couragous for all ages."
2,My Brother Sam is Dead,"If you are looking for a good adventure the James Lincoln and Christopher Collier's book My Brother Sam is Dead would be a great choice. It would a great choice if you liked action and war stories because it is about the Revolutionary War. In the book there is a lot of blood. Before I read the book I knew nothing about the Revolutionary War, now I know a lot. At the end it doesn't turnout how you think. I would recommend this book because it is a fantastic book."
2,My Brother Sam is Dead,"My Brother Sam is Dead is a book that I probably would not have read out of the classroom, It is an okay book if you are interested in learning about some events of the Revolutionary War, but sometimes the story can drag a little bit."
2,Better Than a History Textbook,"This is a book that is pretty good but could used a little more combat action. I didn't think Sam was going to die in the way that he did. I liked learning about the way everything happened during a normal day in the war, like no food and sleep.Overall it was not the best book I have read, but it wasn't all bad."
4,Definitly a worth while read,"In this novel the two authors present a completely neutral look at the revolutionary war. Through young Tim's, the son of a tavern owner, eyes you see how the war effected his family, his emotions, and his relationship with his brother. Not only is this book a good piece of historical fiction, but deep emotions shine through, and even readers of less complex material can understand. I would definitly read this book. It just might broaden your veiw piont."
3,"Good, historical book","Sam Meeker joined the Continental Army in the American Revolution, while his father was loyal to King George. Tim, Sam's younger brother, always admired his brother. When Sam was accused for stealing cattle (which he didn't do), he was shot twice. This was a sad and exciting book that tells many facts of history. Although half of this book is fiction, most of the facts really happened. Like what was about Mr. Heron? He seemed to be a spy for both armies..."
5,This book was by far the best book I have ever read.,"This book really held my interest because it was so graphic and realistic. I learned, in an interesting way about the American Revolution and the very sad reality of war. I recommend this book as one of the best books I ever read!"
5,Great historical fiction,"This story is a fantastic insight into the struggles of not only the american's who fought the Revolution on the fronts, but the struggles at home as well. A must read for any fan of Colonial America."
4,Good story about the American Revolution,I liked this book because it shows you what it was like to have lived during the Revolutionary War. The characters were very realistic. I identified with Tim because he was so undecided and torn about which side to go to. It was VERY good and I recommend it to children of all ages.
4,Entertaining and educational,"This book is a great book for children learning about the Revolution. I read the book when I was in fifth grade. This year I will enter my senior year of college. At the University I have had the opportunity to be tought by one of the book's authors - Christopher Collier. During the classes that I took with professor Collier, I read several of his other works and I highly recommend all of them. These authors have a gift. They are capable of relating, truly and accurately, historical facts and conveying understanding of how and why this country was founded. Yet, thier works, both fiction and non-fiction, are enjoyable to read and even entertaining. For those who enjoyed ""My Brother Sam is Dead"" as a child, I highly recommend reading ""Decision in Philadelphia"" (by the same authors) as an adult."
3,It depends...,U see this book is what i call a pretty good book But the people were right about the point that in the title it does give out the ending.It can be very interesting at one point but a little dull at another. So i call it a 55/45 book...
1,Very Gross-Not recomended,"It was a gross book that gave me nightmares and did not get me exited to read. It did not make me happy to read this book, I do not recomned it. There is too many gross parts that made me and my class want to thow up. It was horrible. My class and I hated this horrible book."
3,Alright book not a good ending,"This book started alright but then as the book progressed, it started to end to soon. It started to get bad when father died and when Sam was to have said to have stole the cattle and was executed. So I think that it should have had a slower ending."
3,William Alan,I thought the book was interesting. The only part of the book was boring was toward the middle where it started to get where nothing happened. Other than that I though it was a good book
2,A waist of time!,"I love historical fiction. I have read many historical books, and believe me, My Brother Sam is Dead is NOT the kind of book I like to read. I thought that it was dark and spent to much time on little details. We read it in school, and many of my classmates agree with me...THIS BOOK IS A WAIST OF TIME!"
1,This was the best book ever!!!!!,Sych Fooled you this book will leave your children scarred for the rest of their lives!!!!!!!!!!!!! They will not be able to sleep in their own rooms!!!! They will sleeep with the parent untill They are exactly 36 and a half years old sadly I learned this the hard way
5,My Thoughts,I really liked this book! I thought it was sad that Tim had almost his whole family died. I would never be able to live with my Father dead and my brother dead!I would never be able to do all the work that Tim has to do! This book is very good i do reccomend this to other people! I think it is very sad why Sam died. How he was caught for steeling his family cow's when he was really trying to save the familys cow's. I think this is a very bad way to die. ACH
1,My Brother Sam is a Dope- LSMS,"This book is the most inaccurate book I have ever read. The language is not of that time, but modern day cursing. Also, it was violent beyond beleif! No book should include the violent and sexual details that this book held in one sentence. I would not reccommend this book to anyone! :("
3,Another re-release!,"It really ticks me off that the studios keep releasing OLD MOVIE and makepeople believe they are a new release. YOu can imagine how mad oldpeople are with forgetful memory, just to remember they have already seen it!!!It's sort of underhanded. Would be nice if Amazon came up with a warning, toalert you. I mean, they warn you if you already posted a review about an item,so why not about a movie???"
4,Great movie based on excellent book,"This movie begins as a coming of age romance story set in Australia. It becomes an action flick when Australia is invaded and the characters have to fight to survive.It is a satisfying coming of age story but spends too much time developing characters (done well) to be a great action flick.I am also a fan of Red Dawn, but thought this movie was much better.If you are a fan of the young adult series Tomorrow When the War Began know that this movie fits the first book quite well and thoroughly sets the scene for a sequel (or nine). I have read the books, where all the components are thoroughly fleshed out, I rather enjoyed the movie."
3,Red Dawn vs.Twilight,"Good camera work, good actors, great location(s), just way too fluffy. A bit like a soap opera taking place during a third world war."
3,Fair Dinkum,"For a kiddies film this was pretty good. Poor tacticts from the Chinese though, needed some sort of sub-plot where old man Withers from the Haunted amusement park on the edge of Wirrawee is foiled in plans to aid the Chinese and could say ""I would have got away with it if it wasn't for them pesky kids"". Seriously, how are the Chinese going to invade Australia. Its big. And a long way from China. These days, China can probably just buy it instead. Like Ugg boots. Which are from Australia. the Chinese didnt have enough Ugg boots and invaded.if I had been one of the teens, I would have retreated to the oasis and ""rooted like a rabbit, blue"" until the appearence of some nice Australian Special Forces.I can't think of anything to say about this that hasnt been saidf in the other reviews, i just wanted to point out that it was actually ok, and not crap. With Vampires."
4,Good Flick!,"I enjoyed this movie about as much as I enjoyed ""Red Dawn"" which is basically the same type of movie. Well acted, and directed. There were no scenes that were ""inconceivable"" or childish. Well done."
3,O.K.,Unfortunately the author of the books finds it necessary to have the characters be conflicted about attacking those who invaded their country. This is political correctness gone wacko. If somebody invaded my country and locked people up in concentration type camps. I would be pissed and would grab the first gun i could find and take as many of them out as possible. I sure would not worry about whether or not we as a country had offended or perhaps not helped these folks enough. That being said the movie is good and the story is enjoyable if you can get past the P.C. crapola. It would be interesting to see how the author felt if this actually happened to Australia.
3,Tomorrow When The War Began,I found this a little unbelievable (and not necessarily in a good way) and am looking forward to the remake of Red Dawn...
3,"Cool concept, okay execution","This movie was just meh,okay. I like the idea, but beside two characters, no one else in the cast seemed tough enough to pull off guerilla warfare. This flick is fine for sitting around with absolutely nothing else to do, but I (in retrospect) definitely wouldn't put this on my must-see list. There are some cool scenes, but overall it ain't great. Final word: you probably won't regret spending a couple dollars on this, but you won't be glad you did either."
4,Pretty good,"I read the series a year or so ago. From what I remember, the movie is pretty true to the book. Yes, a lot of unrealistic things (same as the books). But pretty entertaining. I'd watch it again. I wonder how many sequels they plan to make..."
3,Has all the appearance of a single epsisode television show,"The plotline is implausible but all in all the movie is entertaining. Apparently the Chinese have conquered Australia all while our band of incredibly good looking(for the most part) young heroes are out camping in a gorgeous setting somewhere in the woods of the Australian countryside. The movie pays a bit too much homage to the ""strong female character"" motif often found now as the world seems bent on the emasculation of the useless male creature. All in all though the movie is entertaining though it falls a bit short of any strong recommendation of mine for its viewing. There are most definitely worse movies to rent."
2,"""Red Dawn"" in Australia","I believed other reviewers of this movie when they said it wasn't just a modern remake of ""Red Dawn"", but they were wrong. This is almost a carbon copy, right down to the holding pen for the townspeople and the teenagers wreaking havoc on the invading force. All through this movie, I couldn't help but wonder how this was not a copyright infringement. It's THAT similar. Even the town looked the same as the town in ""Red Dawn"". If you've seen ""Red Dawn"", you've seen this movie."
4,Stand alone or Opening,This movie is a lot like Red Dawn except in delves into the background of the freedom fighters more. It is also lacking in the mission side with only one mission actually taking place during the movie. Camera shots are great more realistic except for the girl talk incident near the end. How it ends leads me to believe they thought this to be a tv series after or sequels but haven't yet (as of 09/19/12).
4,Great movie (assuming there is a sequel),"I found this movie to be wonderful. It really did keep me on the edge of my seat. The filming was fantastic, the acting was a great surprise. I did not read the books, howerver; I was pacing the room wishing to know more. I will be getting the books so I can find out more about the invading army! Its been a long time since I have picked a ramdom movie and been so pleasently surprised. This will be up there with some of my favorites!"
3,Not bad,"First of all this is an OK movie worth watching. However, not quite as much action as I thought it would have. A lot of the fighting scenes are not that convincing as well. I'm not a big fan of unrealistic explosions either and in this movie they use gasoline as an explosive in more than one scene. Overall I do not think this movie is as good as Red Dawn. Never the less, it is entertaining."
3,Tomorrow when the war put me to sleep,"""Tomorrow When The War Began"" is an Australian version of the 80's classic, ""Red Dawn"". Overall the movie is OK...but it is about a military invasion...and there is no action to speak of. It starts out with a bunch of kids on a camping trip in the outback. There is tons of beautiful scenary, but the first third of the movie is just these kids playing in the boonies...transition...one night while sleeping around the campfire, one of the kids lying awake watches hundreds of airplanes flying over head in formation...next third of the movie is spent running from empty house to empty house discovering that all their freinds and family...and everyone else...is gone. Final third of the movie they steal a truck and blow up a bridge. I think the idea started out great...but they didn't have the budget to really make it what it should have been."
2,Nothing Happens,"I went into this movie with expectations of something like Red Dawn. Unfortunately I found Tomorrow When the War Began to be a huge disappointment. There are only two brief action scenes and the rest of the movie is filled with mediocre acting combined with poorly timed narration and a very cheesy soundtrack. The movie is void of any real plot; we were invaded, we blow up a bridge, epilogue - big waste of potential. I felt like I was watching a soap opera. Hopefully the Americans will show up and save the day."
3,Red Dawn is still better.,"The movie is alright and the production value was not cheap looking like some other movies. What I didn't like about this movie that it feels like a Twilight film rather than a realistic action-pack movie like Red Dawn was. For an example, there was a scene where the main character rescue her friends in a garbage truck and drives off under heavy machine gun fire hitting the truck. Nobody in there right minds would do that. I give this a rental and I hope the next one with be a lot better."
2,awful,"if you like a terrible disjointed storyline then watch this. now I know why Australians dont make movies.the premise for the movie had some high expectations yes. (Red Dawn), but the execution was miserable.I kept wanting there to be a suspenseful action sequence that actually contributed to the story. and there was none.the movie was very incomplete, with a handful of meaningless engagements seemingly meant to display mid level pyro- technics.I might have been okay with that if they had focused more on filling in some kind of backstory with more than a very rough sketch.red dawn 1 this movie 0"
5,Wonderful Idea!,"Los Zafiros put together some interesting sounds. They mix Cuban rythms and bossa nova sensibilities. They were also heavily influenced by the doo-wop coming from the US, and they transformed each of these into a new unique sound. Beautiful harmonies and great enery. At the same time the sound is incredibly intimate and genuine. And fun to listen too. Highly enjoyable record.."
2,Interactive Zafiros CD,Completness of CD entries in question. The CD packaging indicates there are 10 songs in this product. They couldn't be all accessed or opened. I shared this CD with fiends who are more computer savy and they got the same results.ThanksHV
1,wrong item received,The item shipped to me was not the NP-60. My money was finally refunded but was a hassle.
3,The Inside,"This album is actually both good and mediocre. The production is raw and rich, recorded in analogue as Mike Fleet and Tito would have it no other way. Fleet insisted on being indie and not selling out. His lyrics, as the vocals, are passionate and under-dressed for the camera. Fleet bears his soul. Take it or leave it.Tracks 4 and 6 are the weaker of the tracks. They allow Dru and Daniel's sound to be a part of the project. However, any typical emo band would have 4 or 5 tracks that are far weaker. They are not just a bunch of angry teenagers, contra the first reviewer. They are artists who are reaching out of the mire for something beautiful, something true, and something real. Two-thirds of this record are worth the download."
1,They really are just bad.,"Someone told me they sounded like depeche mode. They sound like dying pigeons. This album is awful. They say the sound like U2 and Depeche Mode but they are just angry teenagers with no talent and their website is full of self indulgent, self proclaimed recognition. Just another cheezy ""Christian"" band. Don't buy this album."
4,Prospectives Teachers Should Take a Look,"I found this book to be very practical, open, insightful, but above all, honest. It was a hard first semester of Education classes for me, however, after reading this assigned book, I felt not so much inspired, but informed. There are students and situations Mrs. Landsman speaks of that education classes and textbooks can't show or teach you. There are experiences and emotions she shares that really tie the book together. Just because you aren't a teacher--or aren't just yet--for me, I personally felt as if I learned more just by considering myself: my own views, my own understanding, and especially just how many roles a teacher can play and what a significance each role holds. My best suggestion for this book: while reading, keep an open mind. You may be surprised at what you find within yourself."
1,Una basura,"Laura Leon podra tener una figura atractiva, pero para eso, y mas, hay muchisimos sitios en la Internet donde encontrar mujeres preciosas. El caso es que Laura pretende ser una cantante.Como cantante ella es menos que mediocre. Ella no puede sostener la voz y es muy desafinada. En cuanto a este CD, 20 Exitos, ella asesina ""El Otorrinolaringologo"", donde ella desafina a lo grande, y los coros estan atrasados en tres tiempos con el ""ologo"". Yo estoy retornando los dos CDs de 20 Exitos que ordene. Yo NO recomiendo este CD de ninguna manera."
5,Excellent Reference Book,"Ever since I started making websites, I've always been looking for an HTML reference book. But, I couldn't find any that's good enough. Most HTML books are for beginners or those who wants to understand HTML. NONE of them are purely for reference. This book covers a wide area in HTML and it's really good for people who understands HTML. I highly recommend this book for web designers and HTML programmers."
4,The book I use,"I wanted an HTML handbook, not a textbook, something to give me the format and options for each command. This is it.The organization couldn't be clearer: the bulk of the book is the complete list of HTML directives, in alphabetical order. It also includes indices of names for special characters and colors. There's a lot of compatibility information, too, regarding both HTML versions and browser incompatibilities.The ""Examples"" section is weak, and seems to assume a knowledge of SGML beyond what HTML really requires. It's also vague about specifics of style directives, and the relationship of HTML to CSS or embedded scripts. Other books fill those gaps, though. This book works as just one in a more complete library for web-page writers, and that's just fine.There are better books to learn from, but this is the best I've seen for supporting experienced HTML users."
3,Stars for the Writing Not the Subject,"I think Bronson's prose is overall first rate, except for the annoying tendency to name certain phenomena, but why does he pick such a vacuous topic? I suppose we all write about what we know and in this vain, he succeeds as Edith Wharton did with turn of the century New York, John Cheever with WASP suburbia, and Tom Wolfe with any subject he pleases. It's a pity he doesn't live in a region that is worthy of his writing capabilities."
1,Poor Read,"This book was poorly written. There was no real plot, just one crazy story after another.What a complete waste of time. When I was finished with the book, I left it on the train I was taking. I didn't want anything to do with it."
3,Interesting profile of the silicon valley culture...,"Having lived through the tech bubble as a techie, but not ever spent time in the valley, the book was a good perspective on the heart of the tech culture.My major issue with the book is that although extremely interesting and well themed, the stories are not fundamentally weaved together tightly with the theme. Bronson started strong out of the gate. The first few chapters were humorous, funny and extremely fascinating, but the stories did not maintain their grasp on my attention as the book progressed.If you are looking to understand the oddities of the tech culture that produced the technologies now ubiquitous in our culture: yahoo, netscape, even google... this is a fascinating read. If you're that not particularly intrigued by the valley, this is probably still interesting, but not worth wading through."
3,Interesting insight into the Business side of Silicon Valley,"I enjoyed this book; I liked the way Bronson chose the themes for each Chapter, such as The Enterpreneurs, The Programmers, The Salespeople etc. It did show both how many of the people in Silicon Valley 'live on another planet', and it also showed how they've transformed this planet for many of the rest of us.I particularly enjoyed the Chapter dedicated to the IPO of Actuate, not just because I'm an Actuate customer, but because until now I hadn't fully understood how IPO's happen, and now I feel I do (that Chapter in isolation would have rated a 5 from me)."
3,Pretty good book,"I felt this was a fairly interesting and relevant story. It seems that Bronson is trying to perform in the shadow of Michael Lewis and unfortunately finds himself as a second fiddle.Although Bronson is a second rate author in this genre, I have to credit him for coming up with intriguing information and exciting first hand accounts of slithery success."
3,Fellow Techies - Duck out of the way!,"I don't know about you guys but it truly bums me out that the wonderful knowledge base we have known as the Internet is now full of capitalist and e-commerce. If you dont mind it all and find it amusing... this book is not a bad read. It is actually very entertaining. But if you are trying to advance yourself technologically but keep running into dot-com billboards, and if all the e-business hype makes you want to run screaming instead of patiently chugging along learning your language dejour, then wait to read this stuff when a tiny bit of the hype dies down or at least when you get more comfortable with it. This book tied me up into one big nervous knot that threw me off course from achieving my technical goals."
1,How dissapointing,"I knew that Po did not truly understand silicon valley when he tried to say that San Francisco is part of the valley.According to Po, everyone in the valley is on mega doses of coffee, have no friends and have no life outside of work.I live in the valley, and work in a former start-up company and I will admit some of the things in the book are worth reading, but most of the stories are over-cliched.I was on a 10 hour flight and I found it was better to watch the clouds than continue with the book."
3,"Excellent Writing, but Average Book Overall","Bronson writes extremely well, but something was definitely missing. It's worth reading, but it's no great work of non-fiction."
5,Awesome,"Great book, from a great author. I really enjoyed it. If you enjoy reading about and experiencing these exciting times, you'll love this book."
1,"""Available used & new from $0.69""","That's what [Amazon.com] tells me when I pull up this book. And that's pretty much all you need to know. Bronson's book (which, in fact, is not a book but rather simply a bound copy of articles you've probably already read before) is like a rapidly-decaying museum piece. More than any other, Bronson is symptomatic of the superficial, stargazing writer who glommed on to the Silicon Valley late-90s, Internet-fueled craze as a way of elevating himself from his former persona. [In this case, 'bond salesman.']Read Michael Lewis' ""The New New Thing"" instead for a definitive account of the same era. Compared to Lewis, Bronson is typing with boxing gloves on. It's been all downhill since 'Bombardiers.'"
3,Glamorized?,"Considering that somewhere in the book, the author throws statistics on the (low) percentage of people who go on to become the successes defined by Silicon Valley, the perspective of this book seems to be more skewed to the winners. Is the author guilty of propagating the Silicon Valley mystique? Can't answer as I haven't been there, but doesn't stop me from wondering!"
4,Spirit and Substance,"No other book that I have read is more illustrative of the feel of today's Silicon Valley than Po Bronson's latest book. It stands alongside John Sculley's ""Odessey"" and Vikram Seth's ""The Golden Gate"" in it's unique ability to capture the moment.The odd thing about reeading this book is that it seems like I've heard it all before. And the truth is that I have. In some form, somewhere on the web, in all my reading I have heard most of the eight stories before. This just reinforces the transcendant quality of the chapters, each approaches myth. And yet even though I knew what was coming next, each was fresh in re-reading.A memorable work."
3,Just okay...,"While I loved Bronson's first two novels, this non-fiction work really reads like a series of articles. The result is that it feels somewhat slapped together, and since there is (in most cases) closure at the end of each chapter, it feels like it's starting and stopping all the time. That being said, it reads well - like all of his work - and has the humor one would expect from Bronson. (A peeve -- he has the tendency to put names on phenomena he sees...""I call this the Bubble-Gum Bubble Complex,"" etc. Sometimes that works, but do it too often and it looks stupid. This may be another problem with slapping articles together for a book - looks good article by article until you see the whole work.)Anyhow, buy it and read it -- the fact that he highlights non-success stories is worth it all on its own."
4,Worthwhile Reading,"I read this book in a day.Very enjoyable reading. Really well-written and contains fascinating info. I learned a lot.I like the way he takes the long view and puts the Technological Revolution into a historical context. He is an insider without being a tech-head, and he makes that whole world VERY accessible for the rest of us who aren't in the industry.He doesn't get carried away with the power and fast money of this world, and I enjoyed his clear-eyed analysis.He writes with affection and honesty about the people he comes across. For this reason, I think Bronson is best suited to write non-fiction, although I did enjoy The First Twenty Million Is Always the Hardest.He humanizes the Digital Revolution and without resorting to hype lets the passion, excitiment, and phenomenal risk associated with Sillicon Valley come through loud and clear.At the end of this book, it was all I could do not to pack my bags for California. Seriously."
4,A snapshot of the valley,"This book contains many wonderful anecdotes and odd characters. Definitely worth reading, but I'd say Po Bronson should have included more analysis."
2,Disappointed.,I've greatly enjoyed Bronson's other books; which made reading this book an even greater disappointment.He attempts to provide you with a real feel of what goes on within Sillicon Valley. In my opinion; he only suceeded in giving you the same shallow techie-hype that you can find in a few token magazine articles. Nothing revealing here.
2,Not terribly interesting,"The first few chapters were compelling, humorous and downright thoughtful. After that, the format became a bit tired. The characters portrayed here are homogenized to the point that you find the same story repeating itself, over and over. It just became boring after a while. Read the first two or three chapters and enjoy. From there, proceed with caution."
4,Entertaining look at Silicon Valley,"Cool how it shows Silicon Valley outside of the pages of Wired, Upside and the ilk. Nuanced portrayals of geeks vs. suits and those that haven't quite made it yet."
3,Entertaining fluff,"Bronson is about one third writer, two thirds iCelebrity gossip columnist. He's at his best when he delves into the world of the rank and file, the near-misses with success which make up the great bulk of the SV experience but usually don't make it into the glossy magazines. But most of the time he seems intoxicated by his proximity to the rich and famous. Anyhow, at least he writes better than that other hunk-author, Fabio."
3,This toy is old man friendly,Bought this toy for a 50 year old man and it put him in a state of battlestar galactica nirvana. I would highly recommend this toy for all you nerds out there.
3,Inferior to Traditonal Neon,"This switch is illuminated by a green LED in the clear collar around the opaque white toggle, The toggle itself is not illuminated. This can make it harder to see from the side -- as, for instance, if the switched is mounted next to a door. (In my case, the switch is about five feet away from the actual entrance, a sliding glass door with a window panel between it and the wall, making the switch more difficult than usual to find.)In the traditional neon lighted switches, the toggle itself glows, allowing it to be easily seen from the side. I also believe the neon light is brighter and easier to see than the LED."
4,Another great cat book!,"The Cat's Pyjamas is another spectacular book by the British cartoonist Norman Thelwell. In this book, he has taken a series of words or phrases that relate to cats and drawn cartoons that illustrate the meaning or the humour behind the phrase. My all-time favorite is ""octopuss,"" although ""see which way the cat jumps"" and ""make a cat laugh"" are also high on my list of favorites. It's a fantastic book for cat-lovers, and pretty darn funny even if you don't like cats."
5,A Survival story unlike any other.,"Armstrong does a superb job of telling this true story. A survival story that rivals any ever made up. The author clearly did her homework, as the bibliography clearly shows. I appreciate that she used as many primary sources as she could get her hands on. I might have wished for more photographs, but the ones that are included make the story that much more real. The photos taken of the destruction of the ship are especially powerful. This version is more appropriate for older students, simply because of the amount of detail."
1,WARNING:BORING,"My grandfather's friend's sister's husband's cousin was part of the crew on the Endurance and I think that this book is mocking the journey to Antarctica. He cried every night thinking about his trip, and I know he would have been disappointed and offended when this book came out. First of all, the writer acts as though he/she was actually there. Second, it makes the tough journey seem boring, and third of all, Mrs. Chippy was not shot for his own good--he was murdered in cold blood! I sincerely hope you find my review helpful."
4,Shipwreck at the Bottom of the World,Shipwreck at the bottom of the world was a very interesting book. I learned a lot about how it is hard to be part of a ships crew. I also learned about how cold the world really is and how to survive. I espically liked the part about the whales blubber and how they burn it to keep warm.
3,Great for my costume,"I bought it to make myself a Urahara costume for halloween, it was very creative with a green nurse scrub and my black graduation toga. Price was a little Hi."
5,Expecting to Fly: A Sixties Reckoning,"Dudman strikes a universal theme in Expecting to Fly, capturing the wonderlust and uncertainty of youth. Dudman's excellent writing makes this book hard to put down."
3,Expected to Enjoy,"...but I didn't.The prose often sounds like it came straight from a writing course, sometimes woefully artsy and very mannered. Repeated words embedded within terse sentences and one-word objective correlatives, followed by Faulkneresque run-ons sounded contrived and disingenuous.However, there's humor and pathos, and some recognizable period detail (especially if you're from the East Coast) that's appetizing. It's just one person's ""sixties reckoning,"" of course, and obviously it won't always be the same as your own. An admirable attempt to reconcile past and present, the book would have had more power if the writing didn't get in the way. Just a personal opinion, others may enjoy her writerly style."
1,Avoid this book at all costs!!,"I picked this book up at a thrift store. If I could get my $1.50 back, I would. For starters, the grammar is terrible. The commas are either misplaced or non existent, which I guess could be excused due to artistic license. But the editors didn't even bother to catch elementary spelling mistakes.As for the story, I was bored. The author seemed to fall in love with every man she came into contact with in that decade. I was rather disgusted with reading about her repeated attempts to please men who practically raped her. I recommend burning any copies of this book you find."
5,Very Easy to make complex looking and cute toys,"I just got a knitting machine a couple of weeks ago and this book is wonderful.I don't have to be an expert to understand the directions and there are no abbreviations like most knitting patterns. The toys are so cute and they look as though you really know what you are doing when they are done. I think I am a accomplishing something great when I make the toys. The toys are very quick(on a machine or by hand) to make because they are all made from squares or rectangles. The toys would be great made with left over yarns , and you can get creative by adding your own touches and using different colors. They toys are safe for kids since they don't have buttons or anything that could choke a child and if they do, you can leave them off the toy. The toys are a good size at 12 inches or bigger. My favorite is the mermaid and the sitting dog."
1,don't get this from MyNetDeals,"The product for sale is a CH710. MyNetDeals sent me a CH700. According to Motorola's specs, CH710 is a 850mA rapid charger, and CH700 is the cheaper 550mA standard charger.They didn't have the CH710. I wasn't going to spend $5 shipping a $1 item back to them, and they probably knew it too, so I took their offer for a $2 discount after the fact.I asked them to correct their listing so this doesn't happen to other people, but so far they haven't done it after over a week."
2,The price was right....the performance was so-so.,The price was right...the performance was so-so. By so-so I mean that the charger worked on one of my cell phones and not the other...duh...what's with that??So....at least I have a spare...and I will only use it for one of my cell phones.The item arrived as promised and I would use this vendor again...if the occasion arose.
2,This is a MINI USB male connector!!!,This charger has a male MINI USB so it will not work with MICRO USB devices w/o an adapter.Not for RAZR MAXX as description states.Please change the product description.
5,Very satisfied,This charger was half the price from what my service provider was charging me. Works great.
3,Must have for pig owner!,"Great book with suggestions on correcting behavior, doing tricks, and other things. My copy was a bit more damaged than just slightly used, but thankfully it was just on the pages with photos.I definitely refer to it as things come up as well. I just hope my mini-pig doesn't get as big as hers do, with all the treats/rewards for learning how to do so many things. I guess that's were belly rub rewards come in. :-)"
5,Helpful and informative,I am a new owner of a potbellied piglet and need all the expert advice I can get! This book is 1 of 5 that I purchased on the subject and it is the best in my opinion! It covers the basics and goes much further into more advanced tricks/training. It has really helped me in better understanding my piglet (why they do what they do and solutions to resolve any problems you may have) and I reference it often to train my piglet. Quite happy with this purchase.
4,Pigga!,"This book is a great addition to have in your library if you own a potbellied pig. I want the best for my pbp and so I have quite a few books on the porkers. It has a great section of tips listed A-Z. Also, the behavior section is good. I especially like the colored pictures of all the little piggies.=)"
3,The wife likes it.,"Wasn't overly impressed. Audio is well produced, visuals fairly crisp and sharp. Performance was average. Will reside in the back of my collection. My wife likes it though. She says it'll grow on me. We'll see..."
1,No track listing? No samples? I don't get it.,see above. I love kd. Why no info? I'm supposed to buy this blind?
1,"Blue Ray, what the heck is that??","I had no idea that when I ordered the KD Lang, what I thought was a CD, that I was ordering the Blue Ray version! I'm very unhappy about that. I don't have any way of listening to KD, and partially opened the caseing before I noticed that it was for a Blue Ray. Now, I'm stuck w/this CD and can't listen to it!!! I'm very upset about this!!!I've ordered many items/CDs from Amazon, and I'm very disappointed w/my order this time."

3,No Spanish Subtitles,"Take care about this new 4 season. It doesnt include Spanish Subtitles like previous Season 1, 2 and 3."
5,DVD Defects,"Hi all....I'm posting from England just to say that I have the first three series (bought from Amazon.co.uk) and all three play fine. I popped on here to consider buying series 4, because it isn't out in the UK yet (and I have a multi-region player), but after reading these reviews, I'll wait until it comes out in the UK.I don't know if a different grade of DVD is used for the UK version, but I've not had a single problem with the first three.It's a shame your enjoyment of such a fantastic series has been spoiled. Best of luck!!"
5,No Problem with My DVD's,"I don't know what that first guy is talking about. I have seasons 1-3 on DVD and all of my dvd's play flawlessly. If he keeps returning the dvd's , getting new ones, and still having the same problems, it just sounds like a cheap DVD player to me. I would suggest he invest in a better DVD player rather than deprive himself of the pleasure of watching one of the greatest series of all time."
5,One of the best shows ever produced!,"If you're a Magnum fan, the season sets are well worth the price. I for one have not had any problems with freezing, skipping or any other defects. I didn't even know people were having problem.My only complaint is the lack of special features. A few cast interviews or some behind the scenes stuff would be a very nice addition to an already great series."
1,Poor Quality DVD,"I love the show, but had to replace season 4 and when replacement came it was freezing in same place. Thankfully Amazon is great about returns/refunds"
4,Hellboy Mythos,"If you enjoy Hellboy Mythos and are familiar with it, this is a must read. Otherwise, it might be worth a trip to the library, but not as a purchase."
2,I'll stick with the old faithful Melita manual drip,"The coffee is too weak, period. The coffee maker is a pain to clean. You cannot adjust the fineness of the grind. Not everyone has the same coffee preferences so the machine should allow for that and it doesn't. I use the machine when relatives come who prefer their coffee on the weak side (watery!)"
1,Doesn't make it for the long haul!,"I bought the Grind N Brew about two years ago. I'll admit the coffee is fantastic, well worth the price I paid for the coffee maker! However, the machine just does not hold up well over time. The first thing to break was the lid to the coffee pot, within the first month. About three months ago, the digital display went out. Yesterday, all of the lights went on, but it would not start until I unplugged it and plugged it back in. Today, it won't start at all, no matter what I do to it. The worst thing about this is that now I either have to go back to that icky regular drip coffee or I have to buy a new machine every two years."
2,Doesn't keep coffee hot!,"After owning the Cuisinart Grind and Brew for about a year, the temperature control setting no longer works and the coffee stays only slightly warm. I always have to ""zap"" my cup in the microwave after brewing. When I first bought the machine I found it awkward to use, since it's somewhat large and flips up at the top, I had to pull it out from under my kitchen cabinets each time I used it. It's quite noisy and a little messy to clean, but I can live with that and it does brew quite quickly. The top of the carafe isn't very well made and it has snapped off one of the tiny plastic latches and now is difficult to secure back on. The coffee tastes best with bottled water, even though I don't have hard water here. I'm looking for another coffee maker/grinder, since I won't buy another Cuisinart. At it's high price, a coffee maker should last more than one year!"
2,Lasted Only Four Months,"Originally, I loved this Grind and Brew coffee maker because it made great coffee. I found it cumbersome to clean, 5 separate parts, but I didn't mind, because the coffee was great. I used the past tense, because it no longer works. When it was about four months old it started dropping power. I'd have to unplug it and plug it back in. It worked fine for about 2 weeks. It progressively got worse until it died. Cuisinart only guarantees it for 30 days, so I'm out of luck. I'm glad that I kept my ten year old Mr. Coffee!"
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"I bought this pot about a year ago & immediately discovered it only likes Starbucks beans - nothing else. It also does not like any kind of already ground coffee, including Starbucks. Within 3 months I could no longer remove the pot while it was dripping because the coffee continued to drip all over the table. Within 8 months the clock stopped functioning, so it no longer turned the pot on at preset times; within 10 months the spout started dripping coffee whenever I poured a cup. To top it all off - it no longer likes Starbucks beans - it makes the worst coffee I have ever had. Take my advice, don't waste your money."
2,Replacement Parts,"I purchased this grind and brew coffeemaker over a year ago, and have been fairly satisfied. Cleaning is complicated, and it is difficult keeping the water reservoir clean. However, the biggest problem is that there are NO REPLACEMENT parts available. I dropped the grinder/basket and the spring loaded mechanism broke. Cuisinart will not replace that part; therefore, I can't fix the coffee pot and I have lost my $$$ investment. What a shame. I'll not purchase Quisinart products in the future."
1,Bigger is not always better,You're much better off purchasing a simple coffee pot and a separate grinder. You have no choice of grinds and it is a wet mess when finished.
2,Cuisinart DBG300 Automatic Grind and Brew 10-Cup Coffeemaker,"I didn't like how much space it took up on my counter. People always told me how good my coffee is. I bought this because I liked the concept of grinding, brewing, automatic timer, etc. Didn't like the coffee taste, it tasted like plastic. Even after awhile, it still tasted like plastic. I went back to my Farberware pot (makes a wonderful cup of coffee). P.S. They sell it on Amazon.com. The grinder was very noisy, especially when the kids were sleeping in the morning. I also didn't like the beans that didn't grind up in the coffee water reservoir. Also, even if you put a coffee filter in the gold basket, the cleanup was grinds everywhere inside. I sold mine used on Amazon.com. I am glad I sold it before I got stuck with it!!"
3,"Great tea, not so great java","Some of your readers must not be from Louisiana. This thing makes tea--not coffee. If you load it to the top with beans (expresso, no less), you can only add about 6 cups of coffee to get our favored ""cafe au lait"" strength. And with Starbucks beans, it's weak tea at that. Great idea, though. Just needs a little work!"
1,"Weak coffee, hard to clean, not durable","The design is such that you do not get maximum taste from the coffee beans. Stay away from this model. A chore to clean, plus mine broke about a year after I bought it.In a way, I am glad. I got a Melitta coffeemaker to replace it and the coffee tastes much better!"
3,Cuisinart DGB-300 Grind & Brew 19-Cup,"Makes a great pot of coffee. You can buy Starbucks beans relatively inexpensively at Costco or Sam's Club.Criticisms: 4 separate parts (carafe, grinder & filter basket assembly, filter basket cover, and grinder well cover); formed plastic parts for grinder cover and filter basket cover are rather fragile.I have purchased two. The first suffered fractures to the grinder cover and filter basket cover parts that did not affect performance. However, the unit failed entirely with two years of daily use."
3,Great tasting coffee,"This coffee maker makes the best tasting coffee my wife and I have had. I have read alot of complaints about cleaning it after each use, but it didn't seem to be a problem for us. We have had 2 of them and the only problem we see is they don't last long enough. We didn't keep the sales ticket when we bought the first one, which lasted 14 months and the last one is starting to mess up after 8 months. I will send this one back to get it fixed, mean while we are going to try the Melitta grind and brew. My sister bought one and she's on the third one, but it makes so good a cup of coffee if it lasted a year it is worth it. I just wish they would make this coffee maker more industrial so it would last longer is the only complaint."
1,Don't waste your money,"I have used three of these coffee pots. Within a year the paint on the warming plate deteriorates. I have returned them all,paying 10.00 plus shipping. In one instance it took 6 months to get the replacement. Now Cuisinart is saying they have not received my last one. I could have bought a top of the line unit for what I have spent in shipping fees to return three coffee pots. I will be buying another brand next time."
1,Lots of problems with Grind & Brew!,I have replaced it twice....1st one stopped working after a month; Macy's took it back & replaced it. The second one the same thing after 3 months; but Macys said I had to contact Cuisinart I packed it up & mailed it back for a replacement. Two weeks ago the grinder basket broke & leaked coffee all over the counter. Emailed Cuisinart & they sent me a new grinder/basket. Now the digital clock is going out (only can see part of the numbers) It makes GREAT coffee but should last LONGER than a few months!
1,What a Pain,"I bought the Cuisinart Grind and Brew thinking I had just saved myself time. Wrong. This is the most annoying coffee maker I've ever owned. Not only was the chute constantly gummed up with damp coffee grounds, it was maddening trying to pull out the MANY parts to clean it. I felt like I needed a pair of pliers to pull it apart. Nothing was easy. Boo. Hiss."
2,"You buy cheap, you buy often!","You get what you pay for! This is the cheapest grind & brew on the market. There for it lasted a whole 13 months, before it stopped working all together. I won't buy another!"
1,Impossible to Clean,"The oversize lid is not detachable making the interior of the machine nearly impossible to clean. The coffee grinder not only sounds like a space shuttle take-off, but gets coffee grounds everywhere, including the water reservoir, which is inaccessible because the lid can't come off, until it broke off. There are four separate parts that have to be cleaned after every use and wet coffee grounds just go everywhere - even get stuck in the tiny spaces in the lid. Whole coffee beans get stuck in the too small to clean spaces around the grinding mechanism. Big Mistake - Definite DO NOT BUY."
2,A BIG OVERBLOWN WASTE OF MONEY,"I purchased this Cuisinart coffee maker with the idea that I could save time having a machine that could both grind and brew. I followed the directions enclosed with this machine and found that it produced a weak, pallid cup of coffee. Ok, so no problem I just added more coffee beans and less water and so on and so on. What I noticed when I faithfully cleaned the parts of the machine daily is that there was quite a bit of coffee left in the grinder and the screen and that a cup of coffee was now costing me 60% more because of this design/operational flaw. In other words I was having to use 60% more beans in order to produce a strong cup of coffee because much of the bean grind was wasted. So figure it out. With coffee beans costing approx $10-$12 a pound [where I'm at] this coffee maker is nothing but a BIG OVERBLOWN WASTE OF MONEY! I would definitely not recommend this machine to anyone. In fact I'm going to repack it and give it to my hateful brother for Christmas."
1,Warning!,"Yesterday, the heating plate started to smoke and probably would have caught on fire if I had not been in the kitchen to pull the plug. It took an additional 5 minutes for the smoking to stop. We've only had this machine 1 1/2 years. Very disappointed! And it is very dangerous!"
1,Not all it claims to be,"Although this product claims to make coffee equal to what you can buy in coffee houses, I found the coffee to be less than that. In fact, not as good as I make with my old fashioned grinder. It required I use more coffee beans and less water to get even a decent (not great) cup of coffee. The clean up is another story! If you are used to really great coffee at home, steer clear of this product as you will be very disappointed."
1,Poorly designed!,"I've had three of these in three years. The first time I had to replace it was my own fault because I didn't realize I'd forgotten to put the filter in until I heard the coffee overflowing and flooding the base, which basically burned out the inner workings. But on all three the grinder cap had scratches from the grinding blade and the small extension that drops down to let the ""control"" know it's on there develops cracks to the point that on the last two it nearly broke off. That meant the ""control"" would not let the coffee maker turn on. It would just beep as though it didn't have all its parts in place. I did call Cuisinart and they replaced the second one, but why bother with replacing the third when the design and materials are still the same! And on the last one, after a few hours the clock would start blinking to be reset, and I could no longer adjust the temperature setting at all. For the price one pays, it's a piece of junk."
2,I'll stick with the old faithful Melita Manual Drip,"The coffee is too weak, period. The coffee maker is a pain to clean. You cannot adjust the fineness of the grind. Not everyone has the same coffee preferences so the machine should allow for that and it doesn't. I use the machine when relatives come who prefer their coffee on the weak side (watery!)"
2,great coffee but a pain to clean,"I bought this coffee maker (reconditioned)six months ago and although it makes very tasty coffee there are some serious design flaws. First, the programming never worked, or I'm too dense to figure it out. Second, the whole contraption--water, grind, brew--is under one lid so the steam gets into the grinder and clogs the thing up each time. Also, there is no way to clean the water container, which gets all kinds of coffee debris in it from the grinder. It says it has a self-clean function but this does nothing as far as I can tell. Also, if you don't have all the parts in perfectly it beeps at you incessantly until you unplug it! Now it won't even make coffee--it just beeps and beeps and beeps and I can't figure out why. So find another grind-and-brew that separates the grinding and brewing functions. I definitely don't recommend this one and I really want some coffee. Reconditioned warranty is only 90 days, alas."
4,LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT!!!,"After years of Starbuck trips.. and unsuccessful attempts to brew similar tasting coffee at home at last - a WONDERFUL CUP O COFFEE at my very own fingertips! Will pay for itself in a month (with my coffee schedule!)!!!Tasty, aromatic and quiet... only thing preventing 5th star is the slight inconvenience: need to clearn/dry/re-deposit all parts quickly to prevent beeping if programming feature is activated. But understand and worth every step for $$avings and convenience of no long coffee lines!!!BUY IT :)"
2,Cuisinart - tough to clean,"While the combined grinding and making of the coffee in one unit is a great idea, the mess that it created was a pain to clean up each day. The grounds would get caked in on all three removal parts and each part needed to be cleaned before using again. I had the product three months and it quit working. The good thing is that when we call Cuisinart's 800 number, they told us to just return the item to the store that we purchased it at and we got our money back."
2,Glad for a warrantee,"Unreliable and hard to clean.I took full advantage of the warrantee on this coffeemaker. With a only 6 months of service, the grind mechanism bound and couldn't be removed. Cuisinart replaced under the warrantee (I did have to pay shipping charges!) Less than a year later a repeat performance. Again, I paid shipping and Cuisinart replaced the machine. Well you know what happened! The third one just went in the trash as the warrantee expired two months ago.The machine was always difficult to clean - so know I am online to look at Melita's!"
3,Makes great coffee but very difficult to clean,I have owned this product for a few months. I love the ability to grind and brew in one product. It makes great coffee but keeping it clean is very difficult. There are areas which are very hard to reach with any kind of cleaning implement. The programmable clock died a few months ago and the process to recapture recommended by the service people did not work.
4,Cuisinart Grind and Brew,"I love this coffee maker! The coffee brews so good, better tasting than most coffee houses. The only thing I wish was improved on it would be the workmanship. Two parts of the plastic pieces have broken off. It doesn't cause problem for how it works, just a bit annoying."
3,Hit or miss...,"I've had two of these machines. The first one lasted almost 2 years and made outstanding coffee. The second one makes absolutely terrible coffee. I have come to the conclusion that this second machine doesn't get the water hot enough so the coffee is weak and bitter no matter what I do. The temp in the carafe at the conclusion of brewing is only 150 degrees. I spent so much time and money thinking it was my error, but now I'm fairly sure it isn't my fault.If you get a good one it's great, but the one I have now makes undrinkable coffee. I bought a refurbished one the second time around, I'll never make that mistake again. There's a reason why those products are so much cheaper."
2,Sub-par grind & brew,"Bought this unit to replace a 12 year old grind & brew that finally died and is no longer available, ""My Cafe"" by Toshiba. Disappointed in (a) complicated design, and the large number of parts, and (b) flimsy mechanism of those parts. Have had to have several parts replaced due to breakage during normal cleaning. Additionally, the machine is poorly engineered - the most visible result is a coating of coffee grinds within the interior of the lid area, which requires more cleaning than is necessary. Longing for a well made product like the old Toshiba to replace this one. Not recommended."
1,Horrible Coffeemaker,"I bought this coffeemaker for the grind and brew feature. I have always had great luck with Cuisinart until this. Within one week, two of the pieces broke off of the grinding assembly. A tube of crazy glue later it was working again. Cleaning it is another problem. I have the white model which is always requiring a spray down with kitchen cleaner. I put all those little pieces in the dishwasher, but if you need to make 2 pots in a row, you are out of luck unless you want to hand wash and dry them. Next the front latch broke (where the top closes). Nothing a little duct tape didn't take care of! Today was the last straw. The top of the coffeemaker (where you pour the water in) broke off when I opened it. I threw the whole mess in the garbage and was happy to see it go. I would NEVER recommend this machine to anyone. Very, very cheaply made."
2,Trouble squared!,"The idea of a machine that ground & brewed coffee was too good to resist, and for a while it was fine (althought it's noise scared the heck out of my dog); within the first year the heating element croaked. Sent it back & got a replacement unit, which incidentally only is warranteed for the balance of the first unit's warranty! 6 months later, today, with a full pot of coffee on board, it burst into flame! Whoa! Fortunately my husband was in the kitchen and took care of it before the house went up. I'm going back to Braun, no question!!"
1,Worst Coffee maker I've ever owned,"A waste of money and coffee! It is difficult to clean it traps grinds so you waste coffee. It's so loud. LOUSY this is a no star product, but the form makes you submit at least one star. I even complained to the company-they didn't want to hear it."
5,I'll never be without this coffee maker!,I am on my third of this same model and I love it. It is a pain to clean but oh-so-worth-it when you get a taste of the smooth coffee!
2,Like to clean???,"3 parts to clean, Fllter basket, pot and grinder. Steam from hot coffee enters grinder (you need to rinse right away). Made a good cup of Joe 1st time and the parts are easy to take out and clean. I got mine for $40.00 at Macys. Took it back, too much cleaning."
2,Don't do it,Bought the machine 2 years ago now looking for a replacement. Warmer just keeps shutting off and the grind process has to be jump started. Wastes an awful lot of coffee in the grinder. It is a real pain to clean. Needs to be dry or else.
1,Cuisinart DGB-300,"I've had two of these and neither of them lasted a year. The coffee pot drips badly and inevitably dribbles onto the control panel. The LED clock display goes first and then the rest of the buttons fail sooner or later. We had one replaced by Cuisinart and it took them about 4 months to get us the new one. For the money, I think this is a bad buy and should be avoided. It makes good coffee though."
1,Great if it works,"I registered for the Grind and Brew as a wedding gift and was so pleased when I got it because I had used it at my parents' house and thought it was ingenious. Unfortunately, I should have asked my parents what they thought of it. It turns out that they have had to send theirs back to Cuisinart twice because it stopped working. In a matter of months, mine also quit working and will have to be shipped back. Now, I'm using the good old french press."
1,Wrong color,"Macy's picture of the Grind and Brew Coffeemaker was in white. But when the actual coffeemaker arrived, it was black. You can't know for sure what your are going to end up with. Also Macy's charges sales tax, I presume because there is a Macy's store in my state."
2,Not to smart on there part,"We are on our 2nd one it seems they would fix the flaw this machine has steam gets into the grinder and the the water runs down into the motor housing and seizes it up in time then it runs out no to the counter top and its not clear water, what a mess. If you buy this you will see for yourself If you have a [money] to throw away please send it to me."
1,Cuisinart French for JUNK,"I gave this 1 star, because there is no lower rating....have had several different coffeemakers made by Cuisinart - that grind the beans and brew the coffe --- so far NONE have lasted longer than 3-6 months. Customer service was NO help what-so-ever. Will NOT buy this brand again!~"
1,Disappointed,"I never received this product. After ordering, I was informed that it was out of stock, and order was cancelled."
4,Granddad35,"It works very well. Produces an excellent coffee, once you get the ""strength of your choice"" established. You have to change your habits, however - if you want coffee automatically in the morning, you have to set it up at night. Still working on remembering that. Clean up is relatively simple but slightly messy. You can put components back in the unit even if they aren't dry. My rating is based on the belief that cleanup could be made simpler. Quality of coffee is excellent."
2,High Maintenance & Low Durability,"A good idea in theory, but you spend more time cleaning and drying the machine in order to grind & brew the coffee together than you would using a separate grinder. Also, my machine broke after a year and a half. I must confess that I had no complaints about the quality of the coffee brewed."
1,"Annoying, messy, and broken after one year","This seemed like an excellent idea when I saw it in the store. I brought it home and after the first pot, I noticed it was annoying to keep clean as wet coffee grounds coat the inside of the grinder and cover to the grinder, adding an extra step to my daily routine. To pour a cup of coffee, you MUST stand over the sink, as I have yet to pour from the carafe without spilling or burning myself with hot coffee. Also, I've found the ""flavor system"" feature is rather useless, as well. To top it all off, after one year the grinder has stopped working all together. Don't waste your money on the idea that this machine will simplify your life or brew a better cup of coffee. Buyer Beware!"
1,Dead machine,"I LOVE this machine until it died on me after 2 years ownership. It started making bad coffee, burned and strong and then just died. The machine will not make steam. I lost the reciept for the three year warranty so I'm going to buy the new one DGB-600 today. I can't live without this machine but I'm mad that the last one broke. Coffee makers should last forever..Buy a grind and brew and you will NEVER go back to preground coffee again!"
2,not worth the $$$$,"I've owned the maker less than 1 year and grind and brew approx. 3 time a week. Already the motor is weak and leaves a lot of unground beans. Although the flavor is good as are the all the options, I have never owned a pot the required so much cleaning. It was given to me as a gift, so I'm glad I didn't fork over the [money]. ..."
1,Don't waste your time or money on this coffee maker.,"I love the concept of this coffee maker, but it did not live up to it's potential. My unit lasted about a year and a half. I find this totally unacceptable. I've used Bunn coffee makers in the past and they lasted well over ten years. I also had the lid break and had to super glue it back together. It's very difficult to clean and waste a lot of coffee. Finally after brewing a final pot of coffee for me this morning its display went blank. I'm glad I only wasted $40 instead of the full retail price."
1,Worst coffee maker EVER!!!,"We received this coffee maker as a gift this Christmas. Very nice thought, but it's the worst coffee maker that we have ever owned.#1)Multiple parts must be cleaned well before each brew - not only the grinds in the basket, but the grinds in the grinder as well as two additional lid pieces. Pain!#2)The beans and grinds get wet with the steam from the hot water, so much so that 1/4 of the grinds remain in the grinder.#3)The grinder leaves whole beans unground, again due to the steam.#4)It's loud, even louder than our burr grinder.#5)It just broke! The little arm that the lid clicks onto to open and close broke. SO, in order to make anything, I have to have something heavy sitting on top of it to click close. Otherwise, it just keeps beeping.Why don't I just toss it? I would, but my son and his girlfriend bought it for us, probably spent a lot of $ that they don't have on it and they come over often enough that I just can't. :("
5,very charming,this cd is a very powerful and expressive interpretation of powerful emotions. fans of this type of music will find the lyrics very heart felt in its emotional entirity.the artist displayes heart felt symbolism. A very charming piece of music
3,"An interesting book, but without very many probing questions","As someone who worked with the rafters at the base, I was interested to read the book. It was a bit disappointing. There were so many questions to be asked about their detention at Guantanamo and how that affected their life in the US, but the authors seemed to concentrate a lot on current life in Cuba. The Guantanamo rafters had a totally different experience than other rafters and I would have liked to see that emphasized more. I also found some of the questions to be political rather than academic in nature, which for me took away some of the book's value. What's nice about the book is that it has two audiences built in - the Spanish version and its English translation are in the same volume. Overall, it was a nice try at recording the experience, but it lacks depth."
2,Disappointing academic look at the Cuban boat people.,"The boat people episode in Cuban history deserves more depth than this very dry and hurried academic runthrough. The crossings to freedom were dangerous and many interesting stories appeared in South Florida papers at that time. However this thin dual-language ""book"" lacks feeling and in it's remoteness the Balseros come off like stick people rather than human beings.Very disappointing. Do not recommend."
1,is not just about the money,"Please don't waste your time is not even a movie for a sunday. boring, slow, the actors are not really convincing. this is a ""I want to be a rock start but I don't even know who to read a song"""
2,Looks good but only 1 wire,The wire works and looks good the only drawback is probably my own fault that Ididn't read I guess is that it is only 1 wire so I had to use so much for the receiver I amusing for I could've gotten a better and or easier way if it was 2 wires I just hopeit is safe to use for my home stereo because of the primary thing which I neverheard about until now I just figured it was normal stereo wire with 2 sides sothis cost me more than I wanted considering I didn't even have enough to use for my setup.
4,Great for adults as well as kids.,Bought this book on tape for a 6 year old and fell in love with it ourselves. It's nice to have BOT that we can listen to along with kids. I wish he would write more Newberry stories
1,Worst Game Ever,This is the worst game I've ever played! The graphics are poor and the controls are even worse. After making it to the third level I was sick of playing it. To make matters worse you can't save it anywhere. Don't waste your time or money with this game.
1,WORST GAME,"This is the worst game ever. Who ever buys it is probably tricked because all you do is just walk around punching or kicking. Sure you can use bombs and stuff, but you can't be invisible like in the T.V. show or fly at all. Plus, the graphics are super weak and you can tell the creators just didn't have great ideas."
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!,"This game would have been great if it came out ten years ago. I could swear that it looks like a Genesis or Super Nintendo game. It has been a long time since I have seen a side scrolling action game on Playstaion. I could get past all that if the game was st least interesting, but it is not. After five minutes (Including the time it took to load) I put it back in the case. This one will spend a great deal of time collecting dust on my shelf."
1,"Good license, poor game","It seems that the game was poorly designed and put together in a hurry to coincide with the video release. The gameplay is boring and monotonous. The controls are sloppy and difficult. The cut-scenes are minimal at best. The graphics are substandard. Also, the package indicates that you can save the game with the use of a memory card but on inspection, there is no save feature."
4,Big but heavy,"Well designed bag with lots of room for extra stuff. Tough and rugged with high quality materials throughout. Great bag if your are taking your computer on the Iditarod Trail sled dog race. However, if you don't have a sled you are in real trouble. The bag weighs more than my 17"" laptop. If I add any paperwork I feel like I'm lugging around my office desk with paperweights. The good thing is that the big heavy bag comes with a seperate lighter bag for the computer. On local trips I throw my computer in that and carry a seperate notebook."
5,Great product!,"This case is everything I expected from Kensington, good quality, excelent ergonomics, attention to detail, I like the way it balances in your shoulder, I have a ten pound notebook and it feels great when loaded with all the accessories and a few paper files, I highly recommend this case"
3,Kensington Computer Case is versatile,"I had an old computer case that came with my Gateway notebook. Loved it, but the straps broke. the new Kensignton case seems sturdy enough, but definitely doesn't have the number of pockets and great layout my old case had. For the money, I'm content with it."
1,Not the Same Bag,"I ordered this as a replacement for my existing contour pro 17. The picture looks right, but the product shipped is far, far inferior and is missing a whole compartment.There used to be a separate top loading compartment for the laptop and included an additional sleeve. This one combines both compartments into one and omits the sleeve. I was very disappointed. If Kensington is going to create a different bag, then give it a different product number and a different name - like Contour 17 AMATEUR!"
1,"Good from far, but far from good",This bag sounds better than it really is. The strap fell apart in a month and the zipper tabs cracked off within two.Do not buy!!!
2,Busy Bee Tea Set: EXTREMELY SMALL!!!,This tea set is very micro-mini small. It was a huge disappointment to me when it arrived. Little bang for your buck here!
2,Collins wannabes,"The singer is a bad Phil Collins impersonator who tries real hard to sound just like him... without the intonation. This band is indicitave of my complaint with a lot of prog bands now days; they try too hard to be ""progressive"". Genesis wasnt trying to be ""progressive"". They just wrote songs and that is what it happened to sound like. The focus was on writing and performing original music not on capturing the sound of a genre. The effort came before the result. Citizen Cain are guilty of trying to sound ""progressive"" rather than trying to sound like themselves and it comes off as a poor imitation. The result came before the effort.To me ""progressive"" means ""uncompromising originality"". In trying to sound like Genesis these guys are not at all progressive. That doesnt mean that they are bad though; just impersonators rather than innovators. Its a decent listen for those who just cant get enough of that Genesis sound."
2,Poorly Researched Book!,"I have been a fan of Woody Allen's films for many years. I am especially fond of his earlier body of work. I was extremely disappointed to discover how poorly researched this book was! The author consistently misquotes lines from Allen's most popular films and even gets general plots incorrect! It amazes me how easily books riddled with errors get to print! The book appears to contain some interesting behind-the-scenes trivia, but who knows if it is accurate!"
4,We'd all like to run away to the circus,"Otis's *Toby Tyler* is *not* a ""sentimental"" book, despite that Otis wrote in the Victorian era. The icky reputation this novel owes among people not familiar with it stems from a stupid movie by the vile Disney, who turned Toby's South American monkey into a chimpanzee, refused to keep the tragic ending, and otherwise gelded Otis's book. Remember that the late Victorian era in literature was the era of Mark Twain and the much younger Rudyard Kipliing, two people who held high standards in truthful and correct prose.*Toby Tyler* cleaves close to the conditions of the time. I take it that the ""Guilford"" of the novel is indeed Guilford, Connecticut, which I know, and on that assumption I can calibrate the social tensions. I would advise the prospective reader to read the novel and be assured that the author is doing his best accurately to describe conditons. And, it is a good story. Enjoy."
1,A waste album,"If there were C-sides, this last Beck album will be a C-sides album (though, we were warned about: in the booklet you can read these songs were made at the ""Sea change"" time).It doesn't have a song that emerges from the others, as it was in ""Sea change"" and ""Mutations"" and ""Odelay"". But those albums had an inner consistency, that is lacking in here. For istance, in the last Beck album before this, ""Sea change"" it looked like flat and poor at first hearing but every following listeningmade a complex structure become visible, so to reveal an interconnections between song and song making up a whole.""Guero"" is deficient of coherence. A waste album."
2,This messes up your computer,"I checked this cd out in the libary so it was free. But when i put this into my disc drive in my computer i notice that all of a sudden there were alot of popups and such. Also, all these programs that i never had before all of a sudden came into my computer, and then i scaned for viruses and they were hijackers and adware items in it. I have scanned my computer before this and it always says nothing to remove so no viruses. Ok about the cd it is like a bad best of, of all his cds from the past. I like Beck sea change is first rate but this cd is like he got tired of trying things differently and just decide to do copy cat songs of his previous songs. It seems that being happy, having a family and a wife makes for bad music. This cd teached me a lesson i am not going to put any new release cds into my computer ever again. If the record companys want to be this way then i would start downloading music."
1,I like Digimon 1000 times then this album,"Digimon is the greatest show ever. Beck's Guero is lame atempt and trying to get new fans, Yet still play music from 1995... You need to expand Beck.... Play some Slayer covers or techno.E-pro is the only song here i like"
4,Great album,"Beck is back to his old school sound. Sea change was a good album, but after half into it, it was way to slow and started sounding the same. This album has more diversity in it. Some sounds like odelay, some sounds like midnight vultures, and there are some slower mutation/seachange songs. If you are a beck fan, i reccomend it.However, I do not reccomend the dvd expanded edition. It looks nice. It looks like a book. It has about 7 extra tracks on the album. The extra tracks are pretty good, but not as good as the album. The dvd is useless unless you want to see the video for e-pro. The extras are just bad videos to go with the songs and pictures to watch during the songs. the dvd is a big dissapointment and i would reccomed just buying the cd and saving yourself 10 bucks"
4,nice and smooth,"omg!!! i'm feeling beck and his style of making music with the fly, mellow beats and the way he sings each verse...i like the variety of this cd...i think it's catchy and upbeat and outside of the box in it's own way...i recommend to all who have never listened to Beck to try it out...you just might like it...and this cd shows his great talents..."
3,"Good CD, Good presentation, poor extras","First off I will adress the positives of the album. It is a good album and the case it comes in is very neat.The downside is what a letdown the dvd was. if i had to compare it to anything most of the songs were put to a background similar to the ones you can find a windows media player. even the song E-pro had this type of set up despite there actually being a real music video for it.The book was mediocre its about what i expected, some pictures some lyrics. decent.Anyway it is a good album however the extra features in this version of the album hardly justify the increased price, i recommend just buying the album by itself."
4,Very entertaining,"I didn't think that I was a Beck fan, but I happened to hear this when a friend was playing it in his car and was instantly drawn into it. I have been playing it frequently ever since. It is the first CD I have ever owned that has anything akin to rap or hip hop and I just really like how he blends it into so many other styles to create a complete feeling of a musical environment. I will be delving into some of his other CDs in the future."
5,Beck-tionary!,"I am an ardent Beck fan, give me your odelay, your mutations, your midnite vultures. I could go on for days about how good he is so let me settle on reviewing this. My friend made me a copy of Guero and i played it, i played it several times, i played it enough that i couldn't stand owning a copy (as i own an official release of every album) so i went out and low and behold, the limited edition is in my line of sight. As poor as i am i shelled out the money for it and i couldn't be happier. The extra songs are just as crazy, the DVD sound is amazing, the visuals are spectacular and the music videos are excellent. As far as artists that are in my collection, he is one of a select few that takes up more than 4 spaces in my binder. This isn't for everyone, i know i am a crazy fan, but definately check out the regular version of this album, but if you are a hardcore fan, get this and you too can say, ""I own the beck-tionary!""P.S. Watch Futurama"
4,Lifeless imitation of his previous work,"Beck's new album Guero sounds like a mix-and-match of the the styles Beck has experimented with over his past four albums. There are a few gems such as E-Pro and Girl, but otherwise most of the songs seem to fall flat without the flair of Odelay or the emotion of Sea Change. Some songs, such as 'Go It Alone' just fall totally flat and leave you sonically underwhelmed.Beck is still a solid enough songcrafter that the album is still fun to listen to and more interesting than most of the stuff you'll see out there, but in this outing he lacks the experimentation and inspiration that made his previous outings so strong. There's nothing you can get from songs like Que Onda Guero and Scarecrow that you can't get from Odelay, but better, and there's nothing you can get from songs like Missing and Earthquake Weather that you can't get from Sea Change, but better."
4,DVD Audio does not work with some Pioneer players,It is becoming sadly apparent that the deluxe DVD has issues with certain players. Apparently the Pioneer 563A DVD player is not working with this disc well at all. 5.1 locks up and the advanced audio portion is reduced to a muted slide show.Some of us are trying to contact Pioneer to see if they can help: http://forum.ecoustics.com/bbs/messages/1/129534.htmlWish this came on SACD now since Sea Change works fine.
4,Return of the REAL Beck,"No offense to his fans, but Beck has been in a slump. His recent albums, such as ""Midnite Vultures"" and ""Sea Changes"", were miserable flops that lacked the essence of Beck. Well, no worries, fans. Beck is back. The REAL Beck.Beck here returns to what makes his best work so great- head bobbing drumbeats fused with sliding, energetic guitars. Songs such as ""Farewell Ride"" and ""Girl"" deserve to be remembered as Beck's best, right alongside ""Where It's At"" and ""Loser"". ""Que Onda Guero"" is a pop-rap gem that will have listeners toe-tapping for it's entire 3 and 1/2 minute running time.However, this album is not perfect; songs like ""E-pro"" and ""Missing"" feel out of place, and "" Go It Alone"" is just annoying.There is better work out there, but it is very nice to see Beck returning to his roots."
2,Odelay II,"This sounds way to much to me like reprocessed and repackaged Odelay, which isn't all in all a bad thing, but it kind of is also. Odelay was groundbreaking and genious when it was released, everyone was playing catch-up with Beck. Now it is Beck who needs to catch-up. This is vastly different, not necissarily better than Seachange, but it is pretty much and Ode to Odelay. Do youself a favor, build a rickety old time machine, travel back to 1995 and buy Odelay and bask in the glory of Beck's genious circa 1995, when it was still genious."
5,"Purely, Wonderfully Insane Aesthetic","I have listened to only a few of Beck's albums. I first was interested in him after I bought Sea Change a few years ago. I loved it. Then, when Guero came out I thought I'd buy it too. It's completely different but it is wonderful, pulsing music that is varied and beautiful in its rhythms and completely out there in its lyrics and style but is a sort of perfect insanity. I enjoy this album very much."
5,My Tambourine Is Still Shakin',"Beck's new album should get the grammy for album of the year. The first song on this I heard was E-Pro when he was the musical guest on SNL, that song has amazing guitar work, The rest of the CD is great too, Beck puts in alot of different styles of music in this album. Some of the best songs on the album other than E-Pro are Que Onda Guero, Girl, Black Tambourine, Hell Yes, and Farewell Ride. Beck plays almost every instrument (I think the only ones he forgot are the record and that fish shaped intrument I wish I remembered what is was called). It is hard to believe that a high school drop out is a musical genius."
5,Fantastic Album,"I had a chance to preview this album before it was released and I have to say that I am impressed with Beck's latest offering. It is definitely a CD that I want to play over and over. It is probably his best since Odelay, although his albums in between also had some great songs. Overall, this is a worthy purchase and fantastic album by a great artist."
5,His Beats Are Correct,"I'm not going to bore you with a long drawn out song-by-song review which ultimately would flaunt my own narcisism (as many other reviewers seem to love doing). Rather, I will tell you plainly that this is a funky, grimy, and fun mix of electronic, guitar, with the perfect amount of harmonica trills thrown in. I put it in my walkman on the way to class and my cd player as soon as I'm back to my car. As he says in 'Hell Yeah' his beats are correct. Your head will be nodding many hours after listening. It's as simple as this, if you like the not-too-heavy Beck youre going to like this."
4,ImBeckable,"Love, love, love Guero. This album is all over the place and I'm enjoying everywhere it takes me. ""Missing"" has such a smooth latin groove that when I first bought the album I played it over and over. A little rock, a little latin, a pinch of country flavor, a splash of soul, even a littl rap vibe going on. Its unfortunate that some fans tend to expect a certain sound or vibe from an artist all the time and are disappointed when they deliver something new and fresh. I like what Beck has done here and in the past."
5,Please get rid of the microscopes!,"You all are spending way too much time throwing this album under a microscope. Here is how you you review Guero the new album by Beck.Ahem...""HELL YES!""Thank you."
3,SAME O'LL STORY.. heard one ya heard them all..,"We'll this was a silly purchase that just happened, I was hoping to see an artistic change from beck but its the same CD I had in my Camaro in 1995, set to new lyrics.Ill probably never listen to this but I guess if im ever in the mood again ill have it.BECK! are you listening? try a different angle. Guys like gary Clark Jr. are gona send you to the depths of music history!"
3,a three star album,"With the talent involved in the recording and production of this album i expected a much more daring and fun listen. A few good tracks that will stay on my playlist, but not worth the money."
4,"A hot mess, and that's a compliment","Beck's ""Guero"" is a perfect match, really, for the DVD-Audio format -- the almost offhand guitar parts, the spoken-word asides, the joky lyrical bits -- they all bounce around the room in the multichannel mode, underscoring the album's effectiveness.Unfortunately, the songwriting here could have been a bit better. I'm all for the adventurous approach, but there's just a bit TOO much tomfoolery here. The result is an album that doesn't always hang together, though, again, sonically it's hard to argue with Beck's achievements."
4,"A problem, but not a huge one, for older DVD players","I had already heard enough of this album to know that the Dolby 5.1 would be awesome, and I bought this version for that reason, obviously. I also knew from the other reviews that it has trouble working on some DVD players. It freezes on two songs on my aging (7 yrs old?) DVD player, but sounds great on the rest of the songs. The DVD plays straight through on my MacBook DVD player even though it is also quite old now. So overall I am glad I bought this version, and know that when I upgrade DVD players I will be able to play it through. Would definitely get 5 stars if not for technological issues, the album is amazing."
4,Beck's got his groove back.,"GueroGreat album and much more up-beat than 2002's seachance, which also is a great album but very different for Beck. Anyway Im here to talk about Guero which starts out with the very rocking e-pro and goes from there. It seems like Beck bounced back and began to feel better because Guero is a fun ride , Hell yes is a great track and prooves that Beck can still rap with the best of them. Girl has an up-beat tune but very dark lyrics if you listen closely. Farewell ride has to be my favourite track and very dark as well. over-all it's nice to hear that Beck seemed to be out of his depression that was evident with Seachange and overall Guero is a pretty darn good album."
4,Guero=Bravo,"I have listened to Beck's past albums, and I have found that he was pretty good, but nothing he had to give blew me away like some other music has, so when this cd first came out I wasn't exactly running out to the store to go buy it. Then one day while I was listening to the radio E-Pro came on the air, and I was captivated by its amazing lyrics and catchy melody. I found myself singing it to myself in the shower later that day, and I knew I had to go out and buy the cd. Trust me, it was totally worth the money, this cd is amazing. Beck really comes into his own, and almost all of the songs are great ones."
4,"Wonderful album, Beck doing what he does best","I have rewritten this review after seeing Beck play this material live and also spending time listening to Sea Change. I now think there are two identifiable progressions in Beck's work. These are the Mellow Gold-->Odelay-->Guero progression and the Mutations-->Sea Change Progression. ""Midnight Vultures"" to me does not really fit either one. If you enjoyed Odelay, you will really like this album. If you were looking for something along the lines of Mutations or Sea Change this isn't in that line. I enjoy all of these albums, my least favorite is ""Midnight Vultures""."
1,Defective DVD-On my 3rd Copy,"I'm really impressed with what Beck has attempted here. Sadly, I don't know if I will ever get to see all of the features the DVD is supossed to offer. I have already exchanged it twice because the DVD freezes up repeatedly, and my 3rd copy is doing the same. The manufactuer will be getting alot of returns. I hope that they will address the problem. Anyone know how to contact a distributor? The one star is only because of the major defects on the DVD. Beck's new work is fantastic."
5,Don't listen to the negative reviews !,"Anybody who appreciates Beck will love this album. It is unfortunate that Amazon allows any moron to send in review because quite a few have shared their ignorance with everyone. Anyone who does not think Guero is incredible is a moron. Trust me, there will not be a better album this year."
2,No Bueno,"I'm sorry, but this album is boring as hell, and I'm a huge Beck fan. I think the Dust Brothers did a huge disservice to Beck in even taking on the project; It sounds like the Dust Brothers simply put their sonic stamp on it, with no thought of exploring new directions. For me, the best thing about Beck is how each record is a new departure, but this one leaves me wondering if the Dust Brothers simply pieced together recycled material that didn't make the cut on previous records. Even if they wanted to bring back sounds from the past, that would be fine to some degree if the songs were strong. But they are weak. Very weak on the songwriting. I could only listen to the album about three times before I had to put it away from sheer boredom. Sorry to be so harsh, I know we all make mistakes. But c'mon Beck! Take us in a new diection!"
3,"Beware, this is NOTHING like Odelay","For those of you who bought this album hoping for another Odelay (which EVERY review I read said it was), be forewarned...it is nothing like Odelay. These tracks are low key and low energy, even the fast moving E-Pro and Hell Yes.Whereas on Odelay I loved nearly every track, I couldn't find a single track on Guero that really got my foot tapping."
2,Guano,"I hate to say it, because I love nearly all of Beck's recordings, but for someone who consistently puts out 5 star works this one stinks. After hearing the first track I thought, great another CD where I have to skip the first sing. However, the whole album sounds like one long muddy song so I'm telling you to skip the whole thing. The songs go nowhere, the whole time your wondering why this is being compared to Odelay. The only similarity between the two is in their over-production. In Odelay the production complements the fun attitude. The entire time you listen to Guero you are waiting, expecting the next song to be exciting, but it's not. The album is terribly uninspiring; the lyrics are more unrecognizable than usual, muffled behind a hodgepodge of competing sound. If Beck can no longer write songs that make you want to boogie, then he should stick to the blues. I suppose in his hopes of curbing his TRL fan loss due to Sea Change's melancholy and simplicity, he made an ambiguous bat turd."
4,A slice of multicultural pie,"Beck is a true innovator, and he's also the best imitator in the laudatory sense of the word. On Guero, his tunes are auditory snapshots of many neighborhoods in California. Yet, he's got the cross-genre sound to appeal to music lovers in all corners of the planet."
3,Far from the Mish Mash,"I'm not the biggest Beck fan, but Guero is far from the reported mish-mash the press has made it out to be. It has a pleasant, mature groove (i.e, middle-aged), and there are a few truly breathtaking mid-tempo or slow songs here (especially ""Earthquake Weather"" and ""Broken Drum""). For those who don't know his work, this is a representative place to start."
5,great cd,this is a must to your cd collection listen to it as many times as you want this is great music
5,beck 'cuts and pastes' to the max--but nice album results!,"This is one fresh psychedelic-rap/rock jam that actually is a nice, change moving focus on artists in this genre from the beastie boys back to beck and his smooth, simplistic crooning. And nice songwriting that needed a new hip-hop makeover.However, I find that when i just want to call this a retro-70's groove jam i want to jump to a mix of the '50s and '60's ('Que Onda Guero'), '50s and '70s ('Go it Alone') and a nice mix of pretty much every decade from the fifties to the eclectic nineties ('Hell Yes', 'Scarecrow' and 'Girl'). Beck, having had the label of cut-and-paste singer/songwrter thrown on probably at least one of his reviews, does this with a bit of frustration but the frustration fails to overtly disappoint, having highlights everywhere in songs from the upbeat to the slow and thoughtful. beck is apparently thinking his life over and gives other people advice--with an updated rap/rock makeover you just might enjoy."
5,The Return of Beck,Wow I got this cd from a friend as a birthday present. This cd is amazing on so many levels. Every song sounds different from each other. I love the opening of Girl!!! This cd is defnitely worth your $10!!!! One of 2005's best releases!! Go BUY IT!!!
5,Am suprised at some of the negative reviews,I have to say I am surprised at alot of the negative 3 and below star ratings. Leads me to belive that some people have just set the expectations waaaay too high. every song on here is great and it's one of those albums that you keep discovering a new song that you love until you are listening to the whole album over and over again. like another reviewer said it's like a greatest hits package blending all the different styles from his previous albums adding an occasional latin feel to some of the songs. for the people who were dissapointed you should try to give it another chance.
2,Phoning it in?,"Okay, I know it's taboo to dislike a Beck album- but Guero just isn't getting the job done. I might have given a positive review in the first couple days after I bought the album- after all, it's Beck! But, upon listening to it, and growing tired of much of it, I've realized something is wrong.It's hard to place, I find myself not caring about the songs, they're not fun anymore. Hell Yes, for instance, reminds me of something that might have been cut from Midnite Vultures for not going anywhere. E-pro reminds me of something kicked out of Odelay for the same reason. That indescrible Beck groove is still in there, but somehow these songs aren't as filled with it as his previous works.If you're new to Beck, or don't have them yet, buy Midnite Vultures, Odelay or Mellow Gold."
3,"Good solid classic beck, but it doesnt quite soar","ill be short and to the point. beck is extremly talented, original, and willing to take risks. Guero is solid, funky, catchy and fun. There isnt a throwaway track or a standout bad song.however, while the disk coasts at a fairly high altitude, it never manages to soar to new hieghts. it is more cohesive than becks previous efforts, but to a fault. by the time you get 2/3 of the way through, the songs begin to settle into one big mass, and you begin to feel like youve heard it all before.Without a doubt, Guero is a solidly good, fun listen. worth buying, but not strong enough to remain in your stereo beyond the first week of frequent listening.Go out and get it, but dont expect to still find it as entertaining after a week or two."
2,one to the other,"This is Beck's ""cruiseship"" album... if he were relegated to be the stale act on a cruise ship with people wanting to hear Odelay resonate through his hollow Sea Change body...this would be the result."
2,"Buy this to be 'cool', not for the music.","Once again, critics fall all over themselves praising Beck's latest effort. The problem is, while the music is certainly 'different', it's not great listening. The melodies are weak or repetitive and certainly not memorable. So Beck is capable of 'borrowing' from other genres - great, so I should be thrilled he's a chameleon? Sorry, but this is a record ten years from now no one will listen to...but I guess the critics have love something that is 'hip' yet not trendy."
5,CD Great but your Gift Cirtificate Sucks,I love the CD.But when I bought it I wanted to use my Gift Cirtificate. But because my wife had already used some of it on her account I was not able to use it for my purchas. No where on the Gift Cirtificate email did it say anything about not being able to use it on more then 1 account. Nor was I told anything at the time of purchase that my Gift Cirtificate was not useable. It was not untill my order shipped and I received the recipt email that I realized that the money would be comming from my card. If I had been informed I could have used my wife's account instead of making a new one for myself. You should do a better job of explaining how the Gift Cirtificate works.Dan
2,"Step backwards, intentionally","A deliberate step backward, and a deliberate nod to the critical consensus that Odelay is his best work, Guero doesn't sound nearly as fresh as it needs to. Most of the songs sound like leftovers from Odelay, while ""Broken Drum"" seems left over from Sea Change. While there is something almost appealing in an iconoclast paddling to the middle of the road, this does not make the record good listening. While just flat derivitive, dull tracks (""E-Pro,"" ""Scarecrow"") alternate with a few nice moments (notably the funky, catchy ""Girl"") and some perfectly passable, almost interesting songs (""Earthquake Weather,"" ""Black Tambourine,"") the primary approach: sound collage, scratching, and grab-bag of styles has not only been done before, and better, but its been done before and better by Beck himself."
4,Dear Beck Is Back,"I have heard all kinds of music in my 46 years.""Guero"" reminds me of the music I would play over and over,when I first learned how to use a crummy little record player circa 1966.This new music from Beck is best loved by those of us with vivid imaginations.People who dream technicolor dreams.And people who have stepped on broken glass,just when they thought the day was perfect.The sounds are layered in such a wonderful way,this CD has never sounded the same twice to me.And,yes,I play it over and over.Each time I hear different sounds.Each time I love it a little more.Hey,Beck...it is good to see you smile."
2,Disappointing,"As someone who has long been hoping for Beck to return to his trippy energetic sound of ""Mellow Gold"" and ""Odelay,"" I can only say that this CD makes me really appreciate the songwriting artistry of his more low-key releases like ""Sea Change"" and ""Mutations.""Maybe he's too old for two turntables and a microphone now. Or maybe he just did such an outstanding job the first time around, it's almost impossible to mine something new from that particular quarry.I dunno. And in all fairness, ""Guero"" isn't really that *bad*. There are plenty of songs that are probably catchy enough, if they catch you in the right frame of mind. For me, the highlight is the closing track, ""Emergency Exit"". It almost feels like, whew, we've made it to the end of this (obligatory-throwback) album, now we can exhale and loosen up with some sweet slide guitar."
3,"Music is great, DVD is nothing special.","After a while I find the dvd quite boring, just like a screen saver in fractal styles. For me it's a lazy way of creating a dvd. For the music, it's superb, Beck at his best."
3,Not his best effort.,"The first three songs are pretty good, but the album goes steadily downhill from there. I have several of his other albums (Odelay and The Information jump to mind) and they are consistently pretty good all the way through. Not so with this one, but it is definately an improvement over his ""Blue Preiod"". Buy the album if you are a huge fan, if not just download the highlights from somewhere."
2,Crummy copies,"Second rate, self-absorbed, sputtering pseudo-epics are not without slight inspirational instrumental passages."
2,It broke :(,I am writing this on my bf account he bought me the bracelet... Sadly enough I think I got a lemon it broke after 3 hours of wearing it on x-mas we decided to send it back and I am in the process of choosing something else... I was sad it broke the links are not very strudy!
2,Mine broke on the first day,"My husband gave me this bracelet as a birthday/christmas gift (My birthday is Christmas Eve). I put it on immediately and later that day it broke. The bracelet broke a few links away from the clasp. After reading other reviews of their bracelet breaking, we decided to return it. Its beautiful, but if you wear it, it might break. I'm really disappointed because husband never really chooses jewelry for me and when he finally does, it breaks."
1,Broken bracelet,Product was returned. The bracelet broke after a few days of wearing it. Good looking bracelet but no durable. Would not suggest purchasing this item.
2,Broke after 2 weeks,"It is a very pretty bracelet, but it broke after 2 weeks. I was lucky enough not to lose it and returned it."
3,Softcover: Very Poor Binding,"I've been driving for many years. However, I have never driven in the US. I got this book in order to get an idea of the rules as I'll be moving to the US shortly. I received this book earlier than expected from the courier - within 2 days of ordering. The information within this book is sound. However, the first day that I opened it the binding started falling apart. I do not handle books roughly. I still have books that I have used over 15 years ago and they're still in tact. I was shocked to see the binding basically fall apart on simple flipping of the pages. I do not think that there was anything I could have done to avoid this apart from not opening the book. A very big disappointment. This might end up being a waste of money as it will soon be a stack of cards..."
5,"Clear, concise, and complete.","I am amazed at some of the reviews. This book covers every command regarding RIP, IGRP, EIGRP and OSPF in a clear and concise manner and leaves nothing to the imagination. Great preparation for the IP portion of the CCIE exam. I know, I've been there!"
1,Where's the OSPF???,"Do not buy this book if you are looking for a complete OSPF Reference. I was disappointed that the title did not reflect the content. Nice book on routing protocols. For OSPF I would recommend the ""new"" Cisco Press book ""OSPF Network Design Solutions"" which should of been my first purchase."
2,"An OK overview, but not stunning value.","This book certainly isn't principally about OSPF.It contains information relevant to the CCIE program, but possibly not at the depth required.I would recommend GILES' book for CCIE candidates, and MOY's book for those wanting to know about OSPF."
2,Good book.....BUT NOT FOR OSPF !!!,First of all whoever siad that this book is an excellent reference for CCIE preperation is MAD. This book is a disgrace. It is obvious that the author did not spend any time with this project. If you would like to learn OSPF and OSPF for Cisco here are some books you need.1. Routing in the Internet - Christian Huitema 2. OSPF - Anatomy of an Internet Routing Protocol John Moy 3. OSPF Network Design Solutions - Thomas M. Thomas IIThis book is not for anyone looking to elevate their knowledge of OSPF !
1,Just another Cisco Documentation.,"For those of you who feel comfortable with Cisco Documentation books, this book might help, or I suggest you to skip this book."
1,Not focused on OSPF,"You may imagine that you're getting a 340 page book on Cisco's OSPF implementation, but the book devotes many, many pages to everything under the sun, from ACLs to RIP, EIGRP, even IGRP! Why IGRP? Why on Earth? Try Moy's ""OSPF Anatomy of an Internet Routing Protocol"" for a better and tightly focused presentation. OSPF needs 340 pages, easily, but gets short shrift in this book. Avoid."
1,Big disappointment,"As others have noted, the book is not a solid OSPF technical reference. There's lots of introductory networking info in here.The book is also absolutely FULL of errors. Figures and text that disagree, sample path cost calculations that are wrong, and on and on. I found myself keeping track of which I saw more of in each chapter: errors or pages.Oh, and for OSPF... Right off the bat the author launches into a bit-by-bit (literally) examination of all the different packets an OSPF process might generate. It was absolutely maddening to read the details of how OSPF accomplishes something without first getting an overview of WHAT was being accomplished.sigh.This is my first amazon review, written explicitly because of how frustrated I am with this book."
4,OSPF overview,great addition to any CCNP study guides as they tend to skimp over the technical details. This book fills in a lot of the details and helps make it all click.
5,Superb!,Everything that you need on OSPF design in one book!. That's what I call as excellent. Dr. Parkhurst RULES!
5,Excited to Receive It,Watched this series back when it was on PBS network. Looked for a long time to be able to get a dvd of it. So happy I found it.
1,tech disaster,"There are 4 discs for the 12 episodes. First 3 were perfect. Last disc has recording difficulties and and cannot be viewed. Whole dvd is thus ruined. There is a disclaimer at the beginning of each disc alerting for such problems. Missing a few minutes is acceptable, but over an hour is a bit much, especially the ending. DVD should not have been sold. In this case the DVD was a gift which made the entire matter.even worse. This is, however, the first time I ever had a problem with an Amazon product."
2,Not What I Remember,This was one of my favorite shows when it was first presnted on PBS. I do not think the quality of this DVD is that good. I also do not think some of the parts were edited out for this DVD production.
5,Invader Zim Series 1: Zim Figure review,"This was my first invader zim figure. Zim comes with his spider legs, his sidekick mini moose,a bee, his computer display base, and you can also take his backpack on and off. I akso did reviews on Dib, Gir, and Doggie Suit Gir, I hope to get the almighty tallest red figure."
3,too much telling and not enough kissing...,"I really like Suzanne Brockman, she has a consistent energy and a complexity to her characters. Kiss and Tell feels like an early book of hers, it's quite heavy handed, and I have to say I was disappointed.There was little romantic tension, not much of her trademark humour or energy. Her hero is Dr Marshall Devlin, who kisses his best friend's sister, Leila Hunt, whilst dressed as a ninja. There are fireworks, but to his surprise, she doesn't realise it was him. So instead of telling her it was him, well there wouldn't be a book if he did that, we go through 100 or so pages before she figures it out. There are some funny lines and situations, but the book never came alive for me.All serial romances are by definition contrived, but many wear their plots more gracefully than Kiss and Tell does. I would still buy a Brockman on name alone, but if you don't need this to complete your collection, I would let Kiss and Tell go."
4,"great, funny, very sneaky, but it got me into 1998 s.bowl","i used the book to establish contacts, i was at this years super bowl in san diago, on the 35 yard line, all without a ticket!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!e mail me at gustatpo3@aol.com"
5,Very Cool,"Very cool book, the authors seems quite expericened about what they are writing... Im looking forward to the next one.! I hear Larry Rosen will be doing the preface?? Say it aint so??Looking forward to it!"
4,helpful,I got this book for my daughter and son in law after the loss of their infant child. It was a great help for them emotionally.I would recommend it to anyone who is in grief over the loss of a child.
5,Adidas Porsche,It's exactly what my son visualized the product to be.My son chose this shoes as his reward for his good grades this school year and I must say he got the gift he deserves.He was so happy to own this new pair of Adidas.Very nice design and lightweight.He loves wearing it.
4,Audio version makes good car listening,"This collection of literary fairy tales by American authors (from the early 1800's to 1922) makes excellent car-ride listening. While adults and kids alike will enjoy the stories, this book offers more than that. An introduction discusses what elements American writers changed or added to the traditionally-European genre of the fairy tale. Each story is also followed by a brief introduction to the story's author that mentions what particularly American elements readers can find in the story. I really enjoyed this book on two levels: the enjoyable ""story-time"" of listening to the tales, and the analytical thinking-time of the introduction.The only thing that detracts from the audio version of this book is the horrible synthesized music that plays just for a few seconds at the conclusion of each story to mark the end. Fortunately, the reader is excellent and the music goes away quickly."
4,Where's B.U.R.M.A.?,"This is my favorite album of the past 2 months. Unfortunatley, I can only say that half the songs are worth listening to and one of those didn't make it to the US version! Three songs into the UK version I was convinced I was listening to the album of the year, the next six bored me to tears. The US version spreads the wealth a bit by moving Doctors and Dealers to the middle of the album but that portion is still the weakest link.Essentials:DeadwoodDoctors+DealersBang BangYou F-ing Love It (not a great song but a welcome change of pace)WonderingB.U.R.M.A.Would have made a fine EP but I suppose it's almost priced like one."
5,DPT's best album,"This is a masterpiece by Mr Carlos Barat, it's a must have for any of his fans. I love this CD"
1,earrings,"When the earrings we ordered arrived it was such a joke, they were so small that we could hardly hold them, sent them back.The result was satisfaction for the return, the $ was credited to our card very timely."
5,Informative yet riveting story...,Dean does a wonderful job of telling the fascinating story of the x-box from beginning to end while keeping the reader excited. I also liked the amount of detail the book went into and how it really makes the reader feel as if they understand the key characters in the x-box's development.
5,Great Gift for Year after Year,"My daughter received a scratch art kit last year and she truly enjoyed it. Although it has no real ""educational"" value it allows any level of ""artist"" the flexibility to be creative. Even just a simple line or doodle looks majical after making the mark. I am again buying a kit for my daughter's birthday and an extra to save as a birthday gift to have on hand for the next birthday party we're invited too! You will NOT be dissappointed."
3,"nice, but overpriced","my 5 year old daughter loved it, but it last 3 days in her hands, let's face it, this is too expensive for a set of 25 sheets of paper. From the previous reviews I thought that there would be more to it than just paper, but there isn't. Again, it's nice, but it's just paper, I would rather put my money in something she could use more."
1,The truth of scratch art,This toy is non-educational and most kids find it boring.When my art teacher brings out the scratch art all the kids groan.Go to the Dollar Tree and buy it cheap if you really want it!
5,New underground rap album flourishes across country...,"This new underground hiphop rap album is flourishing across the country. John St. Cyr, owner of the new highly anticipated St. Cyr Records & Films, hits you with another great rap album. He produces tracks with Flipside, Black-N-Mild, LA-Slim, and many others on yet another hot compilation. It's no wonder this producer will hit it big sooner or later. He attracts young talent and brings them in to deliver a nice performance. Almost every song is a positive strength for this album. But on the other hand, the only flaw to this CD is F.C.'s song ""Boss Hoggin."" A very boring and tiresome song. But overall this CD should be picked up by some hip-hoppers out there."
2,Ummmm didn't work what I was going to use it for,not such a bad taste but I realized that it wasn't working for me as the herb would regularly perform. I guess I'm getting old and my testosterone level is beyond saving. lol
1,They Took the wHore Out,"Buyers of a certain age who are looking for old-fashioned horehound candy will be sorely disappointed in these bland lozenges which have no real flavor at all.The horehound root has an alkaloid which numbs the nerve endings, and that made horehound drops or candy useful when one was afflicted with a sore throat. As kids, we'd buy it in large squares, and it would numb one's mouth like novocaine. (It was likely the first dope I took.)Now that I have a sore throat, I'd like relief from real horehound candy, but these lozenges apparently contain no horehound extract whatsoever. Instead of horehound, they should be sold as the favorite flavor of Ned Flanders -- ""plain."""
1,No Return of the Finished Product,"""Creations By You"" has not be responsive to any communication in regard to the finished product of my order. I purchased a plate for my grandchildren to create for their mother's birthday. As soon as the product was received they made their project. It was mailed back as per directions and we had to include over $17 for return shipping and an extra plate.It was mailed back to Creations on Dec. 10 hoping to receive it back by Jan. 5th of the new year.Neither have we received the product or have they returned my emails.I will never use them again, nor, do I recommend anyone else."
5,Great gift!,I have bought these plates for my own kids and ordered more to give as gifts. Kids love them and they are a great price.
1,Looks fun but...it NEVER CAME!!,"It looks like fun and can be but hard on a kid to wait for weeks for it to get back. On top of the form is VERY confusing with all the exta costs.I thought you bought it, got it, mailed it back, they mailed when done, but they tacked on more money for shipping of actual plate and other stuff. I will not do that again unless I can pay for all of it togther with out all the ""suprizes"".My kiddo was SO excited but we waited and waited and waited and they said it never got there but I don't know because I did put a note in complaining about all the added costs and then it did not get there? hhuuh I say save your $$ it's a rip off."
4,So much fun for a 2yr old!,My son used this kit to make Daddy a plate for his birthday. Tons of fun were had while coloring with markers and now Daddy has a keepsake to always remember the last year in his 20's :)
1,What happened?,"The suspicion is that as soon as I ordered the magazine, the editor has taken a hike from the office. Previously the interiors in the publication were impecable and some breath taking, now the magazine has become so bland and generic that it seems like Better Homes and Gardens have more sophistication in its pages. Very dissapointing"
2,thick magazine,"I got this magazine from unused airline miles and definitely regret getting it. 75% of the pages are for ads (fancy Iranian carpets, dinner sets, antique furniture blah blah). The design articles and photos seem to be for (a) the newly rich lottery winner or (b) middle class folk who may spend all their time fantasising about a wealthy lifestyle.Avoid this magazine and you will be saving some trees."
2,Not my taste,"The design ideas in this magazine are not from today's modern Southern styles, but only seem to fit the Scarlett O'Hara genra."
1,A magazine of ads,If you are into high brow interior design then this is for you. But my problem is not so much with the magazine as it is about their customer service at Veranda and the subscription department's ability to read. They are by far the worst!
1,never got it!,"I ordered this magazine, and 8 other subscriptions and only received 2 of the magazines after waiting 4 months. Order directly! I can't find anyway to contact Amazon for help on this issue."
1,BUYER BEWARE,"I purchased this magazine along with another for my wife for x-mas. It's been a month and she hasn't received either one. We've been billed for them, but haven't rec'd it. This is the first AND last time I ever order a magazine from Amazon... That's the truth!"
2,"Eye candy, but no substance","Veranda magazine contains stunning photography of homes and gardens. If you enjoy browsing through pictures for decorating ideas, this is a great magazine to dream on. However, great photography is about the only thing this magazine has to offer. Veranda is probably 75% advertisements (gorgeous advertisements, but ads nonetheless), and the few articles it contains are usually shallow and provide dull reading. For those of use who aren't millionaires, most of the products the magazine advertises are impractical luxuries."
5,Absolutely Divine!,"If you describe your style, taste as elegant or refined you will absolutely treasure this magazine. I love it and although my home is not quite as luxurious, I still get many ideas and guidance from this absolutely divine magazine!!"
2,Very disappointing,I loved the magazine when I subscribed several years ago but the new look is very disappointing. I suppose it's just a matter of taste but the three issues I have already received failed to catch my eye. I won't renew.
5,Relaxing on the veranda with Veranda!,"Actually I'm on my balcony so technically it's not a veranda, but the idea is the same! Snap up a copy of Veranda Magazine (subscribing makes it a lot cheaper!), a glass of wine or other long cold drink, put your feet up and spend a few hours poring over the fantastic homes in the pages of Veranda. The photography is top notch and there is a wide variety of homes featured. I subscribe to several home mags and recently ditched Architectural Digest in favor of this one. Why? Because the homes are clean, modern and accessible. Homes in AD tend toward aristocratic, cluttered, dark and gilt edged (or 24 karat wrapped)! Unless you've recently been knighted by Queen Elizabeth or have a second castle in the Loire Valley, you'll probably prefer the homes inhabited by mere mortals in Veranda!"
5,High Quality Publication,"I love to subscribe to decor magazines, and Veranda is one I am addicted to! The quality of the magazine paper, photos, subjects and overall articles are high quality! You can garnish amazing ideas for any size or style home, full of inspiration and delight."
3,"Pretty homes, needs less advertising.","I liked this, but definitely needs less advertising and more content. There are beautiful homes, and some interesting ideas. I like to look at others ideas and less at product I can't afford to buy."
3,Veranda--- Needs More Substance,"I have only had the chance to review one issue ( September, 2010) and although I like what the magazine did cover with regards to various homes and gardens, I think that it needs more substance.Advertising is too much in comparison to the number of articles presented.If you are going to have a quality magazine as portrayed, then please have more feature articles."
2,Not the same Veranda,"I subscribed to Veranda for my mother when it first launched and enjoyed looking through it with her. I recently subscribed to it myself and have been disappointed thus far. It lacks the sophistication and elegance it originally had. The rooms featured in the issues I have received so far are cluttered and overstyled, if not gaudy. I'm hoping that will not be the continuing theme. For those who like things frilly and over the top with colors and prints, it's probably a great choice. For me, I'd like to see a return to more thoughtful, original interiors."
1,auto renewal,I did not renew it..can get at a better price elsewhereHas been a nightmare!!Finally got it removed from account
1,Not worth the one star I gave it,I am sorry to say that I have never seen a magazine that I enjoyed less. The interiors are full of wonderful items but it takes a special talent to put them all together as unattractively as shown in this magazine. After looking at one of the first issues I received and realizing that there was nothing in it that I liked I was surprised and shocked then simply disappointing. Eventually I have arrived at a point of being curious about how this magazine made it to market.
3,Too many antiques for my taste,"A good magazine, well-made. I like that they focused both on the inside and outdoors of your home.It's not that I hate antiques, but it's close. Too many in here for my taste."
4,One of the Very Best Decor/Architecture Mags,"Simply put Veranda has been one of only 3 or 4 ""Must Have"" Decor/Architecture Mags out in the market today. Glorious photography, great writing & inspiring design, architecture & interior decoration! Wouldn't miss a copy!"
3,Veranda,"This magazine is lovely, but a bit stuffy. I prefer something a bit more modern-eclectic. I have canceled this subscription."
4,Great Read For Mystery Lovers,"The Book started off GREAT and kept surprising me with each turn. BUT There were too many People to try to keep up with and what they did. I give this book a 4 stars simply because if you love mysteries like I do, you will love this book!"
1,This device broke my PS2 system!,"Personally, I would not invest in the Sony PS2 game console. I bought one last year for Christmas. After buying all of the necessary accessories, I had over (dollar amount) invested in this (dollar amount) console. A couple of months after Christmas, the console quit working. I called Sony and they refused to fix the problem unless I sent the console in with (dollar amount). They said that the warranty was void because I used the optional remote control unit (which I bought at the Sony store and is required if you want to use half of the features, such as playing DVD's). So, now I have a (dollar amount) pile of garbage. You can buy the new Microsoft X-Box system for (dollar amount) and it comes with an extra game pad, three games (of your choice), a carrying case, and more. And Microsoft will honor the warranty! Or if you don't like Microsoft, buy the new Nintendo system. The Microsoft and Nintendo games are the best. Just don't buy Sony. Never buy Sony!"
1,Playstation 2 Sucks,"Playstation 2 sucks as bad as the first one. There technology is about 3 years old already by the time it was released. It doesn't matter if you waste your money on a remote or not the Playstation 2 is still going to suck. They can't even produce enough. I thougt they were made in Japan? The X-Box and Nintendo are going to knock the Playstation 2 into the ground. This will be Sony's last good selling Playstation. People will finaly realize Sony=Junk. The X-Box will be made in America where they can actually produce enough to keep up with demand. The Playstation 2 isn't even better then the Dreamcast the graphics are the same and the dreamcast is half the price and you can get all the good games on both systems unless you would rather play the bad designed Madden 2001 over the greatly designed, better graphics NFL2K1!"
1,<<<<<<<<<<<<<<DONT BUY!!!>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>,"I used this product, and it caused 125 dollars of damage to my system. The customer service rep for sony says these remotes have been known to cause havoc. Wait for a sony licensed remote to come out!!!! All the remotes have this problem, dont buy this product. As of now, i cannot use ANY dvds w/ my system. DONT USE IT!"
1,Can't get it to work with universal remote,"Since I don't really like the remote control, I figured, I'd just program my learning remote to replace it. However, not only was it difficult to get it to successfully learn any of buttons, but when it did learn them, it couldn't play them back. Grrr!"
3,No need to plug/unplug controllers,"The Saitek DVD, Although it isn't the best remote, but it works. You basically just use the remote to press play , stop and basic functions of dvd control, noting that the remote's function.The first problem, realize Sony should have included this with the PS2, the buttons are too small and is difficult to use. often with multiple pushes required to get the desired outcome.the good thing is that you do not have to disconnect the control."
2,Buy the Sony remote,"Cons: Buttons Too small, not very responsive, not enough direct function buttons.Pros: It does work"
1,DO NOT BUY!,"i just purchased this remote a few weeks ago, and it sucks! everytime i want to press enter on a dvd, it always stops!! go with the regular remote for $24.99 or something like that... stay away from this remote!"
4,good enough,"not exactly what i would call an impressive remote control for the PS2, but it does the job quite well. you kind of have to point at the system directly for it to work at times, and for some weird reason, the play button is the stop button, for every disc i have tried, but aside from that, i can't complain much."
1,POS! Really it is!,I have to agree with these remarks. I wish I had seen these before I purchased my remote. I too am having trouble with my remote. Same as below the buttons do different things than they say. Stop=confirm and confirm=stop. Hell when I turn up my stereo my remote for my stereo is on the same freqeuncy as my remote. If I am playing a game bam! My pad is frozen for 10 seconds. And what is it about having to press the buttons twice for things to happen? Play Play=Play Pause Pause=Pause I say wait and get a better remote if you are so inclined.
4,Remote works great.,Just got my remote control and this one is awesome. My buttons are not reversed like other ones and the remote is very easy to use. I recommend this remote if you plan on watching movies on your ps2. PEACE cel2k.com
3,You get what you pay for...,"First of all, I think the controller looks great with its ribbed casing that matches the PS2 exactly. The infared receiver slips right around the existing connectors leaving room for your memcard and usb cables. I think it even kind of makes the PS2 look a little better. The passthrough controller port is great. The only complaints I have are the famous STOP and CONFIRM button reversal. I'm surprised they're still being shipped like this. The circular D-pad on the remote is also a little hard to operate. You have to press the D-pad in the exact direction of the arrow. If you're even a degree or two off in pressing it, the remote won't respond. Other than these, the remote works great!"
1,Waste of money,"I wish I could give negative stars for this review. The buttons weren't even labeled correctly! My friends couldn't work it, and b/c of not using it for so long and considering the mislabeled buttons, I'm sure I can't now, either."
1,It just doesn't work,"The first day I got it, I plugged it in and started a movie only to find that the PLAY button is really not the play button. The Confirm button is really the STOP button. And the Audio button is really the MENU button. I was really disappointed and bought the other DVD remote out there with the playstaioin controls written on it--it works great."
2,Is there anything better out there?,"I agree with others that this is not the best model out there. But with InterAct having problems, and Saitek offering the port for controller (so you don't have to keep taking out), I don't think you have much choice at the moment.The control is horrendous, and not very intuitive. It took me awhile to figure out that the stop button is actually enter and using the pad to scroll up/down/left/right is ridiculously hard.Hopefully, Sony will come up with a controller of their own. Until then, get this since other ones are useless as well."
3,pointless passthrough port,The only advantage of this remote is that it looks nice. I'd recommend the Pelican controller instead. It is not only 5 dollars cheaper but unlike the Saitek it allows you to keep the remote plugged in and your memory card plugged in. The saitek's pass through port is useless because you wont be able to use your memory card. I recommend trying the pelican remote or waiting for a sony remote.
1,Avoid This Product At All Costs,This has to be the worst accesorie that I have ever purchaced for PS2. The confirm and stop buttons are compleatly backwards.Its sleek design is a pain to hold and it does not respond to commands. What ever you do do not buy this for your PS2 insted by the other available controler its way better.
3,"Not the best, not the worst.","At the time I bought this, it was one of two avalible. The other I wouldn't trust as far as I could throw it. This one turned out to be OK. If nothing else the price is right, especially if you're using your PS2 as a DVD player like me. (Don't get me wrong, I also play games on it, and am trying to figure out just how it would make a missle guidence system ala Saddam). I wouldn't get this however, and would definately get an ""offical"" PS2 remote from no one other than Sony. Saitek generally makes pretty good products, but when dealing with something like your PS2, then you definately want to stay within the Sony family."
1,it serves the purpose and that's about it,buy this item only if you absolutely must have a remote control for the DVD feature of your PS2....I bought one and returned it as soon as I could....I found that I had to push the buttons several times before it would work....not a great product....the only good thing about this is that it looks cool and matches the styling of the PS2
1,Spend the extra $10 for a good one.,"I was being cheap and got this instead of the offical Sony remote. I think I'll be getting the Sony model now, and wasted (my money) on this. The buttons often have to be pressed more than once, and maybe I'm doing something wrong, but the back chapter button goes to the begining of the current title, but I can't go futher back. So I have to stop the dvd and forward to the point I want. (...)"
3,"Yeah, well, why not?","I think that's what you're supposed to say when you see a fully functional remote control for the DVD portion of the PS2 that only costs twenty bucks. The when you unpackage it and slip it effortlessly into the controller slot on the PS2's front panel, noting its dual pass-throughs, you feel even better about the investment. Then you pick up the remote and notice ""batteries not included"", which is a little annoying (especially if you don't have any AAAs lying around). Then you load the batteries in and fire away, noting that the remote's function (range, button layout and tactile feedback) is only marginal, often with multiple pushes required to get the desired outcome. Then you remember what you paid for it, how easy it was to install, etc. and, if you're at all like me, realize Sony should have included this with the PS2 in the first place!"
3,"Not the greatest remote, but it will do","The Saitek DVD remote is great because of its pass through controller port, however, I found the remote responded slowly to commands, especially when using the directional control for onscreen menus. Realize that there was an error made during the manufacturing of the remote, the button labeled ""confirm"" is actually the ""stop"" button and the button labeled ""stop"" is the ""confirm"" button. Overall, the remote is average at best in terms of performance."
3,A no-frills purchase at best.,"Ok...if you have a PS2 you need a DVD remote because you are sure to watch a DVD movie on it sooner or later, and the only other alternative to movie control is the PS2 controller. Keep this in mind...you are going to pay $20 for one of these remotes and the Saitek model is sub-par. My biggest complaint is that the buttons on the remote have to be mashed down to get any response whatsoever from the remote. All of the buttons are jumbled together, look and feel the same, so it is nearly impossible to operate it without looking at it. The only thing I enjoy about it is the green light that flashes on the remote reciever when a button is pressed. If you are going to pay $20, get the one from MadCatz or do the smartest thing....wait for Sony to come out with an officially liscensed remote."
3,Saitek Playstation2 DVD Remote worth the cost,"The Saitek Playstation2 DVD Remote was worth the cost in my opinion. The buttons are confusing at first, because they only have pictures on them, but no more than than trying to use the controllers. I am glad I don't have to stand and wait for the previews to be done so I can push play on the controller."
3,Not bad at all. But not great.,"All in all the DVD Remote isn't bad. It's got a couple of problems with it, however. One is that the Confirm and Stop buttons are transposed. No big deal. The other one is that you have to push pretty hard on the 'Disc' at the center of the controller to be able to get it to work. Until the Sony unit ships, however, it's a great choice and far better than the Interact version (which apparently has ALL of it's buttons mislabeled)."
1,re call,The controller has a slight problem the STOP and CONFIRM buttons are mixed matched there needs to be a recall on these controlers.
1,Saitek....Chinese for ...,"First let me say that I only gave this remote 1 star because that was the lowest allowable rating.That being said, do not, I repeat, do not buy this. I am extremely unhappy with this product. Not only does my controller NOT work while the remote sensor is plugged in (a big reason why I bought it), two of the buttons (the stop button & the confirm button) are misconfiguired.I had read that all of the current models being shipped had this error fixed. Apparently not.Save your money."
1,Stay away from this one!!!,"Sure, I was excited about the ability to have a DVD controller with a pass-thru controller feature. But this thing is not worth it, by any means. The control is incredibly imprecise, having to hit any button multiple times before it will respond (and don't even try to go to previous chapters, due to the lagging response time you will never get further than the beginning of the chapter you are currently on - I finally had to use my PS2 controller when I wanted to go back). Furthermore, as if the responsiveness wasn't bad enough, it started affecting my PS2 controller that was going through the infrared sensor - it would cause the up button (on the D-pad and analog stick) to go up multiple times with every push, rather than just up once (this was very frustrating when trying to use menus on games). I took this piece of junk back and opted for looking for something else."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"The buttons on this remote are not very responsive. It normally takes several attempts to use the remote. Originally I was satisfied with it because it offered me what I wanted: cordless control when watching DVDs. Then 3 months after I purchasing it, the remote simply stopped working. (Yes, I checked the batteries). Please, don't waste your money."
2,Poor design,This remote is confusing and difficult to use. Why can't a remote be designed that looks like all other remotes for DVD and VCR players.
3,Petty Decent little control,"After recently acquiring a Playstation 2 console to act as both a game unit *and* a DVD player, I purchased a Saitek DVD remote control. It certainly does the trick nicely as a remote control, and, contrary to the earlier reviews, the Confirm/Stop reversal has been FIXED, and operates normally. My only regrets are that the controller requires a continual signal press for about .5 seconds before it responds, and that the overall feel of the remote is a bit 'plasticky'(buttons are plastic instead of soft rubber). Aside from this, it is a good controller to have. Of course, if you can wait for something else (perhaps a Sony remote?) to come to market, then you might be better off."
2,"Only 2 good ones, this is the second best","First off, we all know there are no killer remots for the PS2 and using the controller is kind of lame. This one was ok, just way too big for my prefs. Its works fine though, no frills.I'd recommend pelican'sit's ... cheaper and works just as well with a smaller size and a see through color)."
1,Don't buy this,I bought this remote several months after the PS2 came out and have never been able to get it to work well.Stay clear of this one. Several friends have told me that other models do work.
2,"It works, but not well","I bought this remote for the added benefit of not having to use the game controller any longer; but after using it for a little while I switched back because of 2 reasons. 1) stop and select functions reversed, 2) the remote is just plain hard to use because sometimes it functions improperly or not at all as you have intended"
1,Don't waste your time,I bought this for my husband for Christmas. We used it once and gave it away for the full sony remote. It's totally useless and does only a fraction of the commands you need
2,Control is the key,"This remote looked cool when I bought it, but after a few tries, I swiched back to my Dual Shock2 regular conroller to play games and for the DVD functions. First off, the ""Stop"" and ""Confirm"" buttons are swiched, which gets annoying over time. Also, you really have to press the buttons hard or you will have to press them two or three times to get them to respond. Playing the game with the pass-through unit in is spotty, because sometimes the PS2 will pick up that a controller is in, and sometimes it won't (controller is plugged in all the way every time). One more thing, you have to memorize what the icons mean that are on the conroller or you will get them mixed up time after time. Overall, it's alright since there's almost none out, but I'll wait for the new version of the recalled Interact remote."
2,"Looks nice, but Uncomfortable, Slow, and Buggy","I figured I'd complete my Playstation 2 by adding the nice looking Saitek Playstation 2 remote control to the system, but it wasn't worth it. The remote looks nice and sleek, but it's too slim and it feels uncomfortable to hold.The infrared module's reaction time was also a bit slow and the button commands weren't being executed right away. The receiving module has a light bulb that indicates when you are pressing a button, and sometimes I had to press the button a few times because nothing was happening. I must have gotten a lemon because my ""Toy Story 2"" DVD wouldn't play from the opening menu when trying to get it started using the remote control. Even pressing the ""Play"" button on the remote would not start it.There's nothing wrong with using the Dual Shock controller. It reacts fast to the buttons. I got the DVD playing in a snap. I've since boxed up the Saitek remote control to bring it back in for a refund."
4,African girl,Great film and narration. Having recently returned from an African Photo Safari I could really relate to the scenery and the animals.
2,Ok,"This is generic. I bought it looking for better information on birds and ungulates in East Africa. The film really just shows a picture and moves on to the next species for yet another brief synopsis. Check out some Nature, Animal Planet Nat Geo for better background, behavior and species info. Better yet, get a good Africa species guide and take it with you.A tidbit. If you notice, this video is made DVD on demand. If you are prompted by Amazon at a future date to send it in to resell, their third party will not accept it as it is an incorrect format. FYI.I found the guidebook invaluable after my guide would ID e animal and I could review at day's end. You can really pick up quickly if you apply yourself on safari. And bring a good pair of binoculars!"
3,Good General Reference,"This book would be most useful to a VB programmer who wants to get a feel for the .Net world. It would not be a good choice for a non-programmer or a casual VBA programmer.I enjoy browsing the book, but I needed other books to learn VB .Net."
2,A Fair Review,"This is basically a reference book to VB.NEt Functions.The book is divided into 2 parts.Part 1: Gives you A very simplified introduction to VB.NETand is only 143 small pages.(If you put them together it is only 71 normal page). So do not expect much from this book.Part 2: about 400 pages is only a reference to the functions.Button line:Do not buy this if:You want to learn VB.NET throughly.Still I bought it, only because at $2.5(I bought it for that price) it is a good deal for an Index book."
2,Lacking,"After looking to this book as a reference, I have found that it is lacking and missing many of the new, and some old features of VB.NET. Keep your web browser open to MSDN and save your self some money on this one, you will be much better off."
2,There are better books than this one,"Lucks important subjects. Also it is typographically poor - letters are small, thin and hard to read, and the titles are almost the size of the body text which makes navigation harder (...I don't have any eye problems)."
3,Quick read but missing key topics,This book is a good light easy to carry overview but really short on some very significant details (com interop in particular) and has too much on useless topics like how to draw a circle on a form. It works as a readable introduction to vb.net but comes up short as a reference. After reading it I found myself constantly failing to find the information I needed.Great new additions to vb.net such as regular expressions are largely ignored and the coverage of the .NET framework is very thin.If you are an experienced vb developer you really should look for a book with more information on how to leverage your existing knowledge. Look for information on com interop and porting.
4,VB.NET but not in a nutshell,"The book is written for a VB6 guru who is about to write some new code in VB.NET. It features a decent introduction to what's new in VB.NET and a comprehensive list of changes. The best part of this book is its large reference section, which contains a subset of VB.NET's statements, functions and classes, including comparison to VB6 and potential pitfalls. What I'm missing is instructions how to migrate existing VB6 code to VB.NET. Also, the writer's attitude is a big too positive towards the .NET framework. I would've expected a bit more critical attitude on the numerous, sometimes unnecessary, changes VB.NET seems to present. It takes time to read this book, so I wouldn't call it a nutshell, rather a good reference book."
4,Bull Run,"The Bull Run is a very interesting book.It shares the thoughts of all of the men who fought in the war and there feelings of them.It tells who all of the people are that shared there information about what was going on.It also tell about the women who helped out all of the men who got injured, and how they were telling what was going on and how scared they were when the other enemy was coming. It helps you understand about how nervous ans scared you would be in the heat of a battle. Within the story all of the people in the book are explaing the trouble's they went through.It is about the people that thought that they might die cause they were scared that they might be killed, but who wouldn't be scared.This book proves to you how you can feel when you are scared you are to lose your life."
2,Read it for pleasure!,"I read this book for school, and they made us read each chapter like three times. I'm sure it is a very good book, but I've grown to loathe it! Looking past my feelings for it, I love the author. I also learned some very interesting facts about the Civil War. Unfortunetly it is written from so many points of view that it gets a little confusing!"
4,Book Reveiw of Bull Run By:Corey Easterday,Bull Run is a very good book and I highly recommend it to anyone who is interested in the Civil War. This book is different from many other books in the sense that the characters are the chapters and each one tells a different story. My favorite character is Gideon Adams because he stands up for what he believes in. Paul Fleischman is a really great author in my opinion and Bull Run is a very strong example of this.
4,Bull Run,"This book was about a African American man during the civil war. The man wants to get into the war. He has to sneeck into it because he is African but he has light skin so he coud pass as white. He gets cought a few times but then gets in. But what he finds out about war, he didn't expect.I thought that this book was a very adventurousbook and I liked it alot because it cought my mind and right when i started reading it.I would recommend this to anyone because I didnt think that I would like this book but i really did.A reader that would like this book would be, a adventure-war reader."
5,"B.D Review for ""Bull Run","Bull RunHave you ever read that certain book that leaves you hanging on the edge of your seat. Bull Run is that book. Although short, 16 characters, each chapter being 3 or 4 pages a piece, it leaves you wanting more. But I would of liked this to have been the first book of a series, or at least a sequel to it."
3,Bull Run,"My book is Bull Run. It's a historical fiction book about the United States Civil War and the first battle of the bloodiest war in American history - ""The Battle at Bull Run"". The facts are real, but the characters in the story are not. The reason you should read this book is because you can learn more about the Civil War. Plus, the characters made you know what is felt like during the Civil War if you were either black or white."
4,Historical Fiction Book Bull Run,"Bull Run, a book about the Civil War, was written by Paul Fleishman. Paul is skilled at putting many interesting characters into a book such as Toby Boyce, Shem Shuggs, and Lily Malloy and 13 others.The characters come from diferent places both physically and emotionally.Though fighting each other, they learn a lot. They are from the North and South are men and women and are white and black. You will like this book because if you read it you can feel their experience and it will change you. Everyone will enjoy this powerful story."
5,Good Book,This book is very good. I like the way it tells the story from different perspectives and from both Confederate and Union people. I also like that every bit of the story is very detailed. So you can basically picture what the characters are seeing.The book is very strong in the sense that it shows you what it was like back then in the 1860's and how the Confederates and Union troops are different. The book also shows how the recruiters felt about blacks joining the army from Gideon Adams' point-of-view.I learned a lot from this book so if you read it you will learn some too.
5,Excellent,Excellent B+W 77mm Clear UV Haze with Single Coating (010). I am very satisifed with the prodict and the service.
4,Good UV filter,I bought this for my new canon lens and I haven't experienced any problems which affect my photos. The build and glass quality are excellent. I'm looking to purchase a neutral density filter soon and will lean towards the B+W.
3,daytime? yes; all around general protection? not quite,"I bought this filter for my new 50mm f/1.4 lens. Great for daytime shots, but creates ungodly flare at night. It mirrors streetlights and even bright stars onto the opposite side of the picture, so all my night shots look like there's UFOs flying around in them. If you need to point the lens into bright lights - which always creates problems - you'll need to remove this filter lest it compound those problems."
5,Previous poster is non-informed,"It is a known cosmetic side effect (artifact) of the high performance polarizing foils that Schneider/B+W uses in its True-Pols to produce a ""ripple reflection"" to the human eye when viewing high intensity reflected light that ""bounces"" off the actual polarizing foil. This is simply a ""reflected artifact"" and is not transmitted through the lens.This effect is apparent when viewing the filter under certain specific lighting conditions (such as a bright table light being reflected off the polarizing foil's surface from 45 degrees behind the viewer). It appears as a slight visual ""rippling"" appearance in the virtual surface of the foil. You cannot see this effect under any other viewing conditions. It is an artifact from a reflection coming from the polarizing film."
5,Good,"I buy it mainly for protection of my lens. If you really want good quality filters with no optical quality loss, get the Nikon NC filters."
2,It protects the lens but don't see anything else...,"A shop I used recommended this to avoid wiping the coating off on the glass when cleaning over time, so I picked it up here on Amazon for slightly less. I have this in front of my EF 24-105mm f/4L IS USM which is paired to a 7d. I'm a newbie DSLR guy and I'm really not sure what difference this makes in images; then again I am hard pressed to notice any difference when the IS on the lens itself is on or off. In short, don't make the decision to buy this filter (or not buy it) based on my review alone."
1,"flawed filter, flawed shipping/return policy","When I took the filter out of the box and held it up to the light, I thought it was scratched, but there was a ""fold"" or flaw in the glass of the filter, a little more than half an inch long. I returned it for a refund. The original shipping was $7.95. The return shipping was $5.81. Had I bought it straight from Adorama, their shipping would have been $5.00. I'm out $13.76 for shipping on a defective product from a company that has a return policy stating, ""Please wait 8 days from date we received the package for us to process your return."" Also, I question the legality of Amazon's practice of charging credit cards for third-party items when they're ordered and not waiting until they're shipped. The moral? Watch shipping and return policies when you buy a third-party item from Amazon."
2,NOT the best for lens protection!,"I bought this filter for my Canon Rebel T2i in the hopes of keeping the filter on all the time as a cheap way to protect my lens. I had done EXTENSIVE research into clear/UV filters and had decided that B+W seemed like one of the top filter makers. At first glance, the lens seemed to do the trick, though I thought it seemed a little flimsy. However, after doing many test pictures with and without the filter, I was disappointed at the faint flare (little green reflections or ""ghosts"" from lights) that occurred in several shots with the filter. Essentially about half the pictures were ruined by the flare. I ended up buyingHoya 58mm DMC PRO1 Digital Multi-Coated UV (Ultra Violet) Filter.and have ABSOLUTELY no complaints! If anyone is looking for a filter purely for lens protection, I would recommend a Hoya as a good economical filter that won't ruin every single picture!"
4,Does what I need it to do,"It's perfectly clear. It feels rock solid. The threads mate perfectly with my Canon lens. The OEM lens cover snaps in securely. It has stood up to the abuse of this amateur as he's chasing his kids around on hikes, outings, and sporting events. It's definitely more of a lens protector than a filter, but overall, I'm very happy."
5,"very high quality, doesn't affect sharpness but affects color","I tested a few shots with and without the 37mm filter. Under scrutiny, I find no affect on sharpness in anyway but it gives a little warmth to your photos. The glass is slightly tinted yellow, so it will add a slight warmness to your photos. I also see slightly more color contrast with the filter on. This may be a good or bad thing depending on how neutral you want your photos to be. Personally, I like it because it's on my portrait lens. I didn't test this shooting into the sun or lights, so I cannot comment on any flares or reflections."
5,Best filter I've ever used,"Sturdy, clear, high quality glass. Not cheap, but worth the price. I finally figured it out: there's no point in having expensive lenses covered with cheap glass filters, so I spent the extra money and I'm very glad I did."
4,"B+W makes great filters, this one is not multicoated","These filters are great. This one is good for the price. The only downside is that there is no multi-coating. But that means you can clean this uv filter with just soap and water.Check out the hoya hmc around this price point, hard to clean though."
3,"Just an other filter, A tiffen was better","I tried using these in bright sunlight, against window glare, against a bulb and under low light conditions. the results were mediocre and the filter did not do much.. had a negative effect in low light, while I was expecting it to act neutral. I ordered its bigB the B+W HAZE MRC, and everything changed to my delight, under the same conditions.. packaged this one and returned it to Amazon."
5,B+W hood,"Like all B+W hoods, this is more expensive than competitor brands but is terrific glass. I have B+W hoods for all my lenses."
3,Decent Depending on Size Filter,"I usually use Hoya HD UV filters on all my lenses, but I recently switched systems and debated whether I even needed filters at all. Sure, one lens would flare a lot wide-open, and the filter eliminated it completely. But did I ever have a need for protection? Not really - I guess it was for more of peace of mind.Fast forward to my new system (micro four-thirds), I bought a 46mm and 37mm filters. The 46mm slightly increases flare, while the 37mm has huge artifacts and greatly increases flare. These are single coated filters, so I didn't expect much. I'm just leaving them on for protection, and will take them off when taking important photos.The best part of the filters? Super clear glass and a great metal frame. That's about it. You sure get what you pay for, even with legendary B+W filters. I think B+W should just eliminate their entire cheap range and stick with their quality stuff."
4,Good Basic filter,"The B+W Clear UV Haze filter/single coating serves the purpose of protecting an expensive lens. Obviously, for producing a better quality photo, a multicoated filter would be better"
2,It writes I guess......,"When I first received the pen and tried it out the light was blinking constantly. It blinks when I turn the cap and blinks when I press the button to use the UV light, which is annoying. It does its job at picking up RF, although it stops blinking after a few seconds of picking up a legitimate listening bug. The manual states this only happens with cell phone interference, the light shouldn't stop when there is actual RF you are searching for. Then again the manual is full of misspellings and heavy grammar issues so I didn't pay too much attention to it. 2 stars because it does its job, it writes, if the light isn't blinking when the UV is on you can actually use it to check for counterfeit currency (but most the time its flashing and you cant concentrate), and the RF detection works, it just works poorly. If they got rid of all the extra battery's and brought the price down to $20 then I wouldn't complain.I would recommend this to anybody the ages of 9-12."
5,Must reading for all teenagers and those who love them.,"This book is helpful to any teenager and those who love him. It is comprehensive and thought provoking, dealing with all aspects of teenage life. The author obviously has years of experience caring for high school students and helping them become the best they can be. It deals with all types of high school students and all sorts of problems they might confront. This book should be read by every middle-school and high school student and by their parents."
1,"patronizing, fake sounding","This book is superficial and preachy. It is filled with stock answers and suggestions which turned me off and turned off the people I showed them to. It's hard to believe that teenagers would want to read beyond the first page.I also found the language elementary, and the grammar occasionally incorect. Answers to common questions were surfacy. This is a great title with very weak back up in the text. I work in a school as a counselor and have a teenage child, and I'd never give this book to anyone who really wanted the lowdown."
1,Not all true,"This book, as stated by a previous reviewer, is not really for younger children. Even worse, it presents rumors as fact . Warren Harding was rumored to have joined the KKK, even though most of the evidence comes from Klan members themselves. Many historians doubt this happened and have sited far more reliable sources. One of my students, for example, takes this book at face value. It proved a positive learning experience about taking this stuff as is in the book, however, I wish I had not had to do that."
5,good puzzle glue,"This puzzle conserver works as advertised: it's easy to apply, holds together, and keeps a nice finish on the puzzle. I will report back in due course with details on how many puzzles (and how big) it is able to treat."
1,Doesn't Do The Job,"This puzzle preserver only works with two or three applications and then the results are delicate. There are better products on the market both here on Amazon and at your local craft store. I cannot recommend this stuff to anybody and I tried it on two puzzles. 1,000 pieces and 3,000 pieces. It just did not do the job. Sorry."
3,Where's The Stick?,"We have tried three coats with this product on our 3,000 piece puzzle but it isn't working on all the pieces. May need an additional bottle..."
1,STOP! SAVE MONEY,"Don't waste your money on this, go to ANY craft store, or even WalMart, and buy ""Mod Podge"" and a foam brush for $5.00 total. Comes in flat, satin and gloss...I've done many puzzles with it, SAME STUFF....ask any ""crafty"" person if you need another opinion"
4,Good - but I might like glue more.,With glue for puzzles I can at least see where I'm putting it. With this spray it was a bit harder to tell. It also has a bit of a strong odor to it (so you might want to make sure you are in a well ventilated room). Otherwise it held well and worked perfect for the puzzle. There is more left (although I'm not sure there is enough for 4 1000 piece puzzles.)
4,review of Ravensburger puzzle glue,"The puzzle glue was easy to use and it really did a good job It helps top use a plastic paper beneath it like the Rwhat it is expected to do.The only negative is the lack of abrochure explaining its use and I had difficulty in opening th glue cover.It was useful to use a plastic coated paper underneath it like the Reynold freezer paper, before starting to use the glue."
4,Dab-on sealant and glue,"This is one of the easiest to use products you'll find. The instructions are common sense and printed on the bottle. But wax paper under the puzzle, apply the product making sure to fill the joints. Apply again if needed. Wait an hour until it dries. Done. It's basically a bottle of specialty glue with a foam applicator, much like you'll find on shoe-polish. It works well. You could also use as project glue where large applications are needed, or just as a sealer on water-fast products (ie, not water colors or ink jet prints!)An adult can remove the cap easily - a child would have some difficulty - that's the point. The product must be used within one year of opening."
4,This is not a toy but a protective finish for a puzzle,"Once I get a puzzle finished, I usually frame it. I use a foam paint brush and polyurethane finish. It has always worked well. When I found the Puzzle Conserver by Ravenburger, I thought I would give it a try.It is less messy than the brush/polyurethane and the applicator doesn't drip. Apply a bit of pressure to get the liquid to flow and rub it over the puzzle. Allow it to dry and you have your protective finish. Be sure to get it into the ""joints"" of the puzzle pieces as well.The instructions say to rinse the applicator under running water but I found that you needed to squeeze the applicator as well to remove the residue so it didn't dry in the sponge and prevent you from using it again."
3,Sticks well and dries smooth.,This is a very practical item that no puzzle aficionado should be without. It helps keep your puzzle together while protecting its surface from dust and scratches. I used to use a spray glue to adhere my puzzles to a cardboard backing and then finish with a matte or gloss spray on the front to protect from dust and scratches. This product is essentially a 2-in-1 product that both helps keep the puzzle together and also dries smooth and glossy. An excellent stocking stuffer!
2,May have to buy something else.,This is difficult to apply as I cannot tell what parts I have gone over. I do have a pretty large puzzle but still. I have gone over it 3 times and the corners will still fall right off. I will keep applying generously until its gone but I don't have a lot of faith.
3,"Works, but","This stuff seems to work fine and looks good, but being that I am cheap, I will probably try something else next time. But I am satisfied with the results."
5,Easy to use and clean,"This is great puzzle glue. It works as you expect it to, but it's also a well-thought out, easy to clean design. I like that you can sort of see where you've glued before it dries clear."
4,Extensive Reference,"If you're looking for an extensive reference for your bookshelf, this is great. If you need a handbook that you can give to your friend, coworker, or boss to explain your religious practices you should getThe Outsider's Guide To Orthodox Judaism"
4,"Good, but not deep.","This was a good and fast read, but did not contain a whole lot of material. It needs to be read in conjunction with other books on the Taliban, as it will back up specific events that make history come alive. A good read, but over priced for the book.It is up to you if you wish to buy it. Remember, no book is a complete loss, if for nothing more than its subjective opinion.Jimmy"
4,glow,the item attracts the light but doesnt actually glow in the dark however i'm still happy with the purchase.
4,4 Track Import Single,This isn't really an EP as advertised. It's actually just a four track import version of the American Tones of Home single. 1.Tones Of Home 2. No Rain 3. Drive 4. Soak The Sin. I don't have this one so I don't know what versions of these songs these are but if I find out of get this I'll update the review. Long live Melon!
3,Decent Camcorder,"Bought a refurbished unit, minor scratches, etc. Was missing the video cable to plug into tv or computer, no big deal. SD card was small, only 512 k--again no big deal. Saved us about $150-200 from buying a new one. Will see how it holds up, but so far so good. Very easy to use, think my wife will like it."
5,nice camera,This was a good camera for it's time. very compact and easy to use. i enjoyed it till it got dropped in the driveway :( the still picture button broke. still takes video though.
4,Better still camera than my $400 Olympus,"As others have noted, this little unit falls a little short when compared to a MiniDV camcorder. Sound quality is very modest, and the video quality has more artifacts that you expect from a MiniDV unit. Still, it's so tiny, and handy to shoot with, you'll likely catch a shot you'd miss with your bigger camcorder, as you left it back home.The amazing part is the still camera. Fairly quick time to shot, and very respectable image quality. It actually does better in low light than my pricey Olympus. The teeny flash has more output that you might expect too."
2,Grainy Video - Decent Photos,I intended to purchase this for a video camera. Apparently that was a mistake because the video was quite grainy.Returned the camera to Amazon and looking for another one. :(
4,Great video - lousy sound,"Buy the Xacti-C40 for quick, convenient web-cast quality video. This camera is great for making 640 x 480 videos but it is no substitute for a conventional DV camera in terms of image quality.Low light performance is barely acceptable, nothing like as good as my Sony or JVC DV cameras and the image is quite contrasty, so bright, flat lighting is needed for good exposure. Outdoors under cloud or bright indoors works well.Colour quality, grain, smear, etc are all acceptable. Stills are very good with some slight barrel distortion on wide angle.The big failing is the sound. The microphones are virtually useless and I have to almost shout to get any narration recorded while I am filming. Subjects talking to the camera at 1 metre are all but inaudible. There is no external microphone jack so you are stuck with lousy sound unless you have an exceptionally loud subject to film or can separately record sound and add it in post-production.HTHBrian"
5,Works better,"Works better than the manufacturers saw blade.It hasn't snapped yet.Great quality, good saw blades and I have ordered from other sources. This was the best."
1,False Advertising,"I think this product is poorly represented. The pictures all show three beautiful scenes, but the actual product is NOT as it is shown. There is only one magnetic scene and it is the ""folder"" and then the two other scenes are cut in half and are just loose pieces of paper. The magnets are kind small and seem hard to punch out. I will be returning my product ASAP. It is not at all what I expected for $10. I would not purchase this item or refer anyone to purchase this item."
4,The strongest coffee pod I have found to date,"If you are like me, you like your coffee strong. I have found that even though I love the convenience aspect of using the Senseo coffee maker, most of the pods I've used come out fairly weak. Well, not Black Mountain Gold. The cinnamon coffee cake flavor I sampled was the richest coffee pod coffee I have tried to date. It was rich, smooth, and had just a hint of bitterness. Behind the Donut Shop Classics brand of coffee pods, I'd say these are the second best I've tried."
5,Excellent overview of shroud silliness,"Nickell does a clear, thorough job of debunking all the silly contradictions and self-delusions of those folks who insist on believing that this long-acknowledged fraud actually contained the body of Christ(even the Catholic Church denies its authenticity). A good review of the actual ""shroud"" tradition (contradicted by the bible itself) and the scientific data disproving the shroud's miraculous nature. Highly recommended for clear thinkers who prefer fact and data to fanciful speculation and self-delusion."
2,needs more,"for a group so good and been in the music industry so long 5 videos is not enough. I've counted and their is a total of about 17-20 videos made by new edition(with bobby and johnny) from'83 to present day 2005. This dvd is ok if you're a first timer but if you are a huge fan like me its not enough and it needs moreso if you want to buy it go ahead but my reccomendation if you really want a New Edition video that will knock your socks off is ""New Edition past and present""the tracks for 20th century masters-New Edition- cool it now,mr. telephone man, if it isn't love, can you stand the rain,i'm still in love with you"
2,Not for the fact,"That i hated it. Because obviously i'm a New Edition fan, but come on. There only five videos on this one. They are good and everything, but there should be in my eyes at least 9 or 10 more NE videos in this. To be considered really the best of New Edition.So if someone is listening and knows what's up please fix this. Not a bad buy, but could be a LOT better."
1,Don't Do It!!,"I wouldn't purchase this due to the fact that they left out some of thier other great videos. Why leave out Count Me Out, the number 1 debut Candy Girl, NE Heartbreak, Popcorn Love, Is This The End, Crucial, My Secret (feat. Magic Johnson), Hit Me Off, She Gives Me A Bang, and You're Not My Kind of Girl??? Correction to one of the reviewers comments (A viewer), A Little Bit of Love (Is All it Takes) was never made into a video, but that does not excuse 20th century from leaving out the good videos mentioned. I'm sure glad I did'nt purchase this! Just Don't It!"
4,WELL WORTH 8 BUCKS !!!!!!!!!!,"1ST AND FOREMOST, THIS IS NOT A BAD COLLECTION OF VIDEOS ...A SMALL COLLECTION ...YES....AND THAT'S WHY I GAVE IT A 4 STAR RATING.....BUT IF YOU LOVE CLASSIC VIDEOS SUCH AS ""COOL IT NOW"" ""MR.TELEPHONE MAN"" ""IF IT ISN'T LOVE"" ""CAN YOU STAND THE RAIN?"" AND THE AMAZINGLY PHOTOGRAPHED ""I'M STILL IN LOVE WITH YOU"" FILMED IN ITALY- ORDER YOUR COPY TODAY ...I AGREE WITH OTHER REVIEWERS, WHEN THEY STATE THERE SHOULD BE MORE VIDEOS....BUT UNTIL SOMEONE PRODUCES IT .....I'LL SETTLE FOR THIS COLLECTION ... AND IF YOU ARE A TRUE NE FAN...YOU WOULD TOO....WELL WORTH 8 BUCKS"
4,Just 5,"Ah Man! 20th Century Masters, come on!!!!! Why just 5 videos? This was a big tease. That's the only reason I gave this video a 4 star rating. Where are: NE Heartbreak, CandyGirl, Hit Me Off, You're not my kind of Girl, My Secret, Earth Angel, A little Bit of Love, Popcorn Love, Is this the End...I guess for $8 all you could put on this DVD was 5 videos.Still brought back good memories of the years each video came out. I can still do some of the moves to If it Isn't Love. LOLLook forward to a more complete DVD!!!!!"
1,A DISAPPOINTED NEW EDITION FAN,"I am the biggest NE fan and when i saw this dvd on amazon I was so excited. Then when i got it there were only five songs on this dvd. That is just pathetic!!!!!!!! NE is the number one r&b group of all time. There are so many songs that NE has done such as candy girl, is this the end, NE Heartbreak, Count me out, my secret, a little bit of love is all it takes, I can't believe that those songs aren't included on this dvd, not to even mention bobby brown, johnny gill, and BBD videos. New Edition should produce another greatest hit video dvd and include every song they ever made. I am truly disappointed with the quality of this dvd. Please!!!!!!! make another dvd with all the number one hits."
2,5 VIDEOS? I thought this was supposed 2 b a collection!!!!,"I give 5 stars to NEW EDITION and the videos themselves but come on! For a fan,the DVD is a HUGE disappointment. 5 five minute videos...are they serious? When a group with 12+ videos from their 7 album, 20 year career get a 25 minute DVD that's called a ""collection"" it's a joke! Not even Candy Girl(their FIRST video & hit)was important enough to make the cut? If the makers of the 20th Century Masters series on DVD are truly interested in honoring these artists, they should try to come a lot closer to a complete video history than this. For fans of a group as under-rated as New Edition, these videos plus the classic footage of the more rarely seen videos would make it a DVD to be cherished. This one is just a thrown together, incomplete version and does not even come close! It get's 2 stars: 1 star for the thought, 1 star for us to wish on for more!"
2,Just not right.,"We need more videos. What kind of crap is this ? I'm a die hard fan of new edition and this is just disrepectful. Where is Candy girl,is this the end,your not my kind of girl,N.E. heartbreak,hit me off,something about you,you don't have to worry and Hot 2 night ? They need a full length DVD also with the BBD hits,Bobby Brown,Johnny Gill and Ralph Tresvant solo hits. The fans will buy it. do the legendary group some justice."
2,not as good as it sounds,"The wisdom cards do provide some inspirational messages but, I found that all the cards basically say the same thing. As a result of this I'm getting bored with my deck.About half of the deck is nicely illustrated and the other half seems to lack the art. So, if your looking for inspirational drawings this is not the deck to purchase. Don't bother with this deck. Look around.I recommend The Relax Deck, which offers more thought provoking ideas and commentary without being to repetitive. It also contains some exercises to practice. The illustrations are also very beautiful and inspiring."
4,nancydrew,"I love these cards but some do not fit my way of thinking. So just pick and choose the ones you like. There are enough to excuse the ones that are not so good. I love putting these cards around my house, or I read them before going to bed to give myself positive thoughts for sleeping. The quality of the cards is excellent--sturdy cards with a glossy finish. The artwork is whimsy. Have fun with these cards."
5,interesting spin on positive gift giving,"great gift. small. simple. these don't just lie around and gather dust, but can help you (& friends) clear the dust out of your head(s) and heart(s)."
5,Photoshop pretties come to Corel!,"Enough of converting Photoshop techniques over to PhotoPaint. Finally, the Prince & Duke have given the Corel community what the Photopaint users have had for years: A book full of easy recipes for awesome effects. This book belongs on every Corel user's bookshelf -- though it will probably spend most of its time propped open on your desk.I can't put it more clearly: If you use CorelDraw or Corel PhotoPaint, eat canned beans for a week if you have to, but GET THIS BOOK!"
5,"As always, excellent!",This book is so beautiful it borders on being an art book as well as an instructional book. Gary Preister and David Huss have done an excellent job on all the different effects you can do with Corel and Corel Photopaint. Very inspiring!
4,"""Very helpful""",An easy step by step how - to guide book makes corel 8 simplified right down to the short cuts. Well done gentlemen !
4,Good but meager,"The main problem with this book is not a presentation or knowledge. The book is fine and shows nicely the amenities of Corel's software. The problem is the book costs too much. No CD, no comprehensive approach and still 50 bucks. I think that is too much. However, otherwise the book deserves recommendation. Faced with the meager choice on the book market I begin to understand why is Photoshop so much more popular though as a software it is not an inch better than Photo-Paint. (Well, I have not seen version 5 yet)"
2,It's not her worst song,"Sarah Connor can do worse. This is her second best song (she has only two!). In ""Bounce"" her voice sounds not that bad as it does in many other songs. If you listened to this song and want to buy one of Sarah's albums LEAVE IT! As all of her songs sound exactly the SAME!!! Her English is the worst I have ever listened to!"
1,poor quality,This ring was not what I expected. The stone is very shiny. The little stones around the perimeter look fake. All the stones look plastic-ish. Was super excited to get this ring but I'm returning it.
5,A must read!,This book lays the foundation for non-violent direct action. Written in the early seventies the writer links the 21 century to the non=violent thinking of the fifties and sixties that changed the world!
3,The book is good but the multimedia CD is deplorable,"The book is a good start for those interested in learning c++ for the first time, but is by no means a comprehensive coverage of the language. Especially when covering the advanced topics such as multiple inheritance, templates, and exceptions it falls a bit short of what you really need to know. Also, the multimedia CD's content is ok but the navigation tool is horrendously bad and seems only geared to a sequential coverage of the subject matter. You'd be hard pressed to use it as an occassional reference. The audio presentations on the CD sounds like that Rabbi on the Seinfeld show. The voice is so nasal and monotone it is sure to drive you crazy."
1,A ponderous tome by any standard... and weak as it is large.,"Do authors ever read their own material? To see a book published on a programming subject without errors would be a real treat. Punctuation and grammar are poor, sentences run on and on and on ad nauseum.Don't bother with the CD, it's limited usefulness matches the book. This is no where near a comprehensive coverage of any language let alone the one it's about.DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY. I wouldn't have the book were it not shipped free to our department for evaluation."
3,The book is medicre. The multimedia CD is usseless.,"I knew nothing about C++ when I started, and I know a little bit after going through the first three chapters. Even if the book is not bad, but I wish I had bought another. It contains didactical mistakes, like add compications when introducing a new subject. The exercises are not enough to complete understanding of the subject. There are also repeated exercises almost in the same page!The multimedia CD was a complete disapointing! It doesn't really add anything to the book and it is not interactive at all.The package comes with a CD, Microsoft Visual C++, but once I installed, I could not find any explanation of how to run it."
1,"The Deitels know their stuff, but can't communicate.","I am a C++ programmer, and my wife is using this book for a C++ class. I am constantly amazed at the ideas she gets from this book until I read Deitels' bizarre explanations. Also, the exercises are ambiguous, so the course instructor sometimes interprets the requirements differently. The CD contains the exact text of the book, plus audio. Part of the text is presented in sequence, other parts you see in a popup window only if you happen to click on a busy-bee icon. The only use I see for the CD is the search function, which would help to deal with the disorganized presentation of the material. Unfortunately the search returns nothing, or a list of unrelated items. You need to copy the CD to the hard drive to speed up access. The free Visual C++ compiler is nice, but don't run multiple copies to get multiple editors, as you can destroy your source file. Check out Eckel, Lippman, Meyers, Stroustrup."
4,one of the better ones but not really applicable,A real good book for learning the real basics. The problem with it is that after that you rae really lost.
4,How come this stuff isn't all over the radio?,"I'll keep it simple here. This is a good solid release. I dont have any other titles by these guys but I will now. The cover or Russ Ballard's I Surrender is worth the price of the ticket alone! Good heavy power/prog, melodic and fast.Fans of EDGUY,Sonata Arctica,Stratovarius, Rhapsody.......... Buy it!"
5,Better than Ambiem and a shot,Absolutely the best bedtime reading to fall quickly asleep. Much more effective than 1-4th Editions. Richard S Glosser MD Orthopedic Surgeon.
2,File Creation!,This book starts off very strong and the author is very clear and concise. I learned alot... but then something happens... the author decides to wait for covering floats until after he covers File I/O and he rushes through that. I was completely left hanging with not one example of writing data to a file and the author expected me to be able to complete an exercise in which I need to write data to a file. After this...the next chapter back tracks to covering Floats... which should have been covered previously with the other data types.
1,Don't buy it!,"This book is totally useless for beginner.When you read it ,you will feel very confused.There are not enough examples and the explanation is not clear.If you really want to learn C,I recommend you the book which called 'Beginning C' by Ivor Honor.'Practical C Programming' is totally useless ! Don't buy it!"
5,Very good tutorial!,"I am currently reading this book because I need to learn the C programming language. I have some programming experience so most of the book is a review for me. I find it to be interesting, concise enough but not too much, very enjoyable and informative. Highly recommended to all in need of a C tutorial!Udi, Israel"
4,"Very good, not perfect","The author has many good points about style, many valid. Except that I find his over use of comments unessicary, especially when commenting declarations of variables. Simply unneeded (most of the time) If you name variables correctly. While I definitely do not subscribe to the idea that hard code to write should be hard code to read. Some basic literacy, in common variable names such as I or j for integer counters. I am about way though the book, I particularly liked chapter 7 (Programming process). My only other criticism of this good book, is it doesn't prepare the reader much to some of the common bad conventions and bad habits some people have, and likely will see. The book is pretty easy to read and it's a good beginner book, if not the preferred beginner book, just mildly over hyped. I learned some new things, a good read."
5,BEST C BOOK EVER,Well i don't know who could not give this book 5 stars i've been reading C and C++ books since the age of 15 and the only complete... book very concise and very clear strong emphasis on style book i have read is this one. This is one of those books you must have to truely understand C. cant wait for another one.
3,Be careful of these reviews...,"Looks like someone who doesn't know there's a difference between ""Practical C"" and ""Practical C++"" has managed to mix up which reviews go on which page, and has even repeated the same review on BOTH pages. Chances are that most reviewers were not confusing the languages: just someone at Amazon."
3,Not for true beginner programmers...,"Through out the book, the author pops new materials with out really explaining the background, leaving me confused (often times I needed to look at other c books to understand). Although this book is not for true beginners, it has the best explaination and easy to understand chapters on pointers. probably the best book on pointers I've seen. If you are confused about pointers, get this book."
3,A disappointment,"I must admit that this book was a disappointment, below the standard of other ORA books.I suppose it is supposed to be targeted towards those who are just learning to program; however, the value of C as a first language is, in my opinion, questionable. I found that many topics which interested me (and would have been relevant) were only touched lightly if at all, and its poor glossary and index rendered it a poor reference work.However, the sections on coding style are very good."
3,A mediocre book from a great publishing house,"I felt this book is structured in an awkward manner and very tough to use as a reference. It certainly does not live up to the high standard of other Nutshell books I've read. I would barely recommend it for beginners who want a tutorial-based introduction. For anyone else, it's not worth the price."
1,Had to use another book that was more understandable,"This book is useless for beginner C programmers. This was the book that was assigned to a 2nd year programming course. In a class of 50 students, most of us found the book useless. It was too complicated, didn't have precise answers, and didn't explain things in detail. Not enough examples were given."
2,Not good enough to be stand alone book but 2 stars for effort,"I could find better stuff just looking around the internet. I could see the author put alot of work into it but is not a good instructor. I'm sure he understands C but as for teaching it that is another story. I was hoping it would be good beginner book but in my opinion it is not. It starts off with the basic stuff all right but the author expects you to jump from point a to point g without explaining b,c,d,e, and f. I mean ok sure the first few chapters get you interested and your thinking it's going to teach you the ground work on programming but it falls really short. Then it just jumps into more complicated stuff and the complicated stuff just isn't very good. There are not many examples and I think that is the heart of programming. If your going to learn you have to build up with easy programs and then get into the difficult stuff. Well I'm off on my search for better books. Any suggestions would be welcomed."
3,Fustrated by lack of solutions to exercises,"Overall this book covers all the corners of C. What fustrated me most that none of the exercises in the book had solutions. You know how when you are learning something new it's nice to go peek, and see if you are on the right track. Well with this book I guess the author feels you should figure it out on your own. I've not got the time, I've got to learn it fast, trial and error are a waste of my time. 90% of the time you are taking your coding approach from something aready written anyway."
5,Best C book I have Ever read,"Undoubtedly the best C book I have ever read. Stresses readability of code over size. Demonstrates how to effectively Debug code, how to optimize code, and gives down to earth practical instruction on C programming. I would recomend this book to anyone wanting to learn C, or to anyone who knows C and wants to further their knowledge of good C programming theory."
2,"Maybe as an introduction, but worthless as a reference","This book does a reasonable job introducing basic C concepts. However, the topics are interspersed with the author's opinions on programming style and process. This makes looking up answers difficult. Furthermore, major language concepts are either glossed over briefly, or left out entirely (e.g. I can find no mention of function pointers). I bought this book expecting something like other O'Reilly titles (a concise and thorough language reference), but I ended up fairly disappointed. Finally, the author's attacks against Intel's x86 architecture, however accurate, are inappropriate for a guide to a programming language."
4,Huh?,What is everyone talking about this is a C programming book. Alot of people are saying this is good for learning C++ or that it's is good to learn the basics of C++. I've never read it but the title says C so what does that tell you about how much C++ is covered.
5,Interesting From Start to Finish,"I bought this book a couple of years ago, and once I began reading the first page I couldn't stop until I'd finished the whole book. The things that JB had to go through as a young boy, it's a wonder he didn't wind up on death row, or in an early grave. It's a good thing that he turned his attention to music, and put all he had into it. Even though he was never really raised by anyone, or had a real family life he was able to make his mark in life. I'm glad that he acknowledges the power of God, and he knows what God can do. I enjoyed reading this book. This is a must read for everyone."
3,Gap cologne purchase,"I love the product, but the picture in the ad showed a much larger size than was shipped. That was disappointing."
5,most helpful,Don't be scared by the number of pages or smaller print size of this book. Intermittently I help a friends 13 year old daughter [to whom English is a second language] with some of her homework. She wanted to build her own PC [for brag value] With the help of 2 `Build your own pc' type books and this one which she used to figure out what to buy she did so with no help.Each hardware area is investigated and for each alternative the pros and cons are reviewed.Some of the most `bleeding edge' 3d gamer stuff is not here I am told by two lifeless ones.
4,A Gem of a PC primer!,"O'Reilly's an up and coming publisher of computer related books. Maybe a kingpin already. This selection is a true quick reference guide. Written by the Thompsons, this selection gives you a thorough look into buying, assembling and operating computers. You do need a basic understanding to get anything out of this book, but if this is the case, you won't be disappointed. I have a first edition copy, and it's still current. That says a lot, a first edition published four years ago is still not too outdated! Think about it. How many computer related books can you think of that's relatively current after four years? Huh?"
4,"A FINE PC HARDWARE BOOK, BUT...","The PC HARDWARE IN A NUTSHELL is one computer book that tried to bridge the gap between a beginner's hardware knowledge and that of an advanced user or learner. It provided detailed information in a chronological 'nutshell' format. Every aspect of a typical Pentium and Windows-based system received luxurious dissection. There are also valuable purchasing and troubleshooting tips.However, like most U.S. PC books, this one didn't come cheap. Less than expected information were apportioned to non-Intel and non-Microsoft items. Again, the fact that the authors advertised certain trademarks over and over again, in the course of providing shopping tips, made them a bit more self-serving (than the honest arbiters consumers expect them to be)."
5,Possibly the best trainer being published.,"Enamait stands apart from the current politics and fitness factions regarding methods of training. He tries everything himself, and passes the best on to us. Anyone who can get through an advanced Ross routine is in -great- shape, but more importantly, anyone who dedicatedly applies effort to Ross's system will eventually -do- that advanced routine."
4,Digital does not mean error-free,"Every digital transmission system has a finite BER (bit error rate). The notion that a signal sent as a '1' will always be received/decoded as a '1' is not consistent with the laws of physics. There is an entire specialty within the science of information theory devoted to identifying and correcting transmission errors in digital signals. It would be far more helpful in this context to actually report on your observations of the product rather than some made-up notion you have of the physics involved. I have a somewhat longer monster HDMI cable that I am quite pleased with, but no, I have not subjected it to BER testing so I can not comment on its quality relative to other HDMI cables."
1,Completely superfluous - buy a cheap one,"While high end cables make a difference for analog signals (such as composite), the difference is far less with digital signals. In fact, digital signals arose mainly because they were not nearly as prone to noise, and small errors could be fixed with error checking. Thus, buying an expensive digital cable is a complete waste of money - the difference will be very slight (if noticeable at all), so save your money for some more games and buy a cheaper cable."
1,Don't be a sucker,"A digital cable is a digital cable. My HDMI cables cost $6 each and work every bit as well as this overpriced piece of hype. I use very nice speaker cable because it does make a difference, but these do not. Same goes for DVI and optical cables."
1,Rip-off!!!,"Buying this cable is just like throwing money in the trash - cheap HDMI cables will do just as well as Monster. Monster needs to make products that actually have some justice to the price they charge. There is a small difference in analog cables and speaker wire performance, BUT THIS IS DIGITAL - THERE IS NO DIFFERENCE IN TRANSMISSION QUALITY with short distance connections! Cat 5 cabling with a HDMI plug at the end will do just as well!!! I have purchased Monster cables in the past, BUT NEVER AGAIN - this is treating consumers like they are complete idiots!!!"
3,Get a less expensive cable with the same quality,"Monster makes great, great products, don't get me wrong, but HDMI is the same from any manufacturer. There is absolutely no difference between this $85 Monster HDMI Cable and a $33 Phillips HDMI Cable availble at any retailer. All in all, this cable will provide you with the best picture and sound. and it is excellent qualityy, but you can get the same thing from a standard HDMI cable for much less.Only buy this Monster Cable if you hate money."
1,GIVE ME A BREAK,STOP WASTING YOUR MONEY ON MONSTER CABLES A TWELVE DOLLAR CABLE FROM CABLES TO GO IS DESIGNED TO PERFORM THE SAME FUNCTION AS A 100$ CABLE FROM RIP OFF MONSTERCABLE. FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO THINK YOU KNOW THE DIFFERENCE...LMFAO KEEP BUYING EM'!
1,"Don't get this, you can do better!","Overpriced for what you get. No need to pay Monster prices for a digital cable. Sony recommends using a cable rated for HDMI 1.3 to get the full benefit of Blu-Ray playback, and Amazon offers one for just 30% of the Monster price (seeCables Unlimited Premium 2 Meter Version 1.3 HDMI Home Theater Cable (PCM229502M)). Same results, and save yourself a lot of $$."
1,"Don't waste your money here, you're buying a name, not a better cable","If you want a high quality cable, go to blue jeans cable and buy one. They are as good or better than the monster cables, they have far better service, and a superb return policy. Oh yeah, and they cost less than half what these ridiculously overpriced Monster Cables cost. You will get NO better performance out of a Monster Cable.Honestly though, just buy a Monoprice cheap $5 cable, they work every bit as good as the monster cables."
1,waste of money,"Seriously, don't be a sucker and buy one of these ridiculously overpriced Monster HDMI cables. Do a search online to find HDMI cables that are good and much cheaper (I suggest monoprice)."
5,Exelent cable,"The best, no problem,no overhead and to low price. if you wanna a cable good at low price, this do you need"
1,"The show gets 10 Stars, the DVD, 1 Star!","I'm a die hard fan of the wire but the DVD design is terrible. Not being able to hit play and have each episode play one after another is annoying and clunky. After each episode you go back out to the main menu, then you click on the next episode, then it takes you to a synopsis of that episode then you hit play. ARRRGGGGHHHHH! Did the same people in charge of the Baltimore Public School system create this DVD? Did Maryland politicians create this DVD? Fudge! I hate it....and I'm having a hard time buying anymore of the DVDs because of this design."
3,Eh. Maybe I need to give it another try?,"Everyone I know said, ""You haaaavvvvveeeee to watch The Wire!!!!!!!"" So we tried the first episode and part of the second, and we thought it was pretty boring actually. Maybe we'd get into it after a while. But also, cop shows have never really been our thing, except we did like the series 24 when it was on, and that's approximately in the same genre, sort of."
5,Great series!,"I bought this on a friends recommendation and loved the series. It shows you a side of TV that you don't usually see. Both the good guys and bad guys are multi dimensional people with whom you sympthasize with and root for. If you haven't seen this yet, you definitely should! i'm buying season 2 and 3 now."
2,Boring,"We really wanted to like this, but couldn't get through more than a few episodes. Maybe we'll try again sometime."
5,Good quality video,I've been watching the later seasons of the wire on tv and love it. I've been wanting to get up to speed on the older shows so being able to get this video was perfect. I watched it on my Kindle Fire and also on my PC. The video quality is good but the volume was a little low on the Kindle. My only suggestion is to get the whole season at one time. I believe you save a few dollars for the season.
4,Review The Wire First Season,I saw the last four seasons before I watched the first season. I think it's just as good as the other seasons. I did notice the characters were more intense in the first season than any other season yet. You'll be on the edge of your seat at the end of each episode. The first season establishes some of the grudges that were seen in later seasons. Over all it was a great buy!
5,Sorry I missed this when it 1st came out!,"I am going to keep it brief as plenty of people have written essays about how wonderful this show is!Writing - SUPERB!Acting - FLAWLESS/BELIEVABLE!Cinematography - RAW!The show has set the standard for quality programing! Never has there been a better cop/legal drama then this!My bf got me into it during the last season and I have had the fortunate experience of catching up to the 5th and final season! I really, really wished I would have known how great this series is when it first aired, I mean REALLY!All I can say is WATCH IT! As of 3/30/10 HBO On Demand is showing season 2 or you can Netflix it! I am doing a bit of both!"
5,Gentleman from Chicago's South Side,"Simply the GREATEST SHOW EVER!!! Need I say more, growing up in the inner city we saw The Wire everyday. The way the show is written is very tactful of life in an urban environment. It depicts every aspect with great detail and attention, which is something most shows don't do. I'm pleased with where this show takes us each season and I can't wait for season four. Every actor and actress earns an award from this show in my book, much love to my boy Wood Harris Chicago's Own for doing his thing. All I can say to The Wire is keep up the good work and to all of you who love so-called reality shows they have nothing on The Wire. Reality at its best, as Omar would say indeed!"
4,The wire,This was purchased for a friend who is in love with show. Thought I would surprise them with starting a collection for them.
4,Season 1 of The Wire,"I would recommend this DVD to anyone who enjoys well crafted stories, intelligent writing, and good acting. David Simon has put together a show that gives the audience a real feel of what law enforcement has to go thru to solve a case and also a feel for the drug trade in Baltimore, Maryland. Simon does a great job of showing the human side of each character, from the detectives, to the dope fiends, to the drug dealers. If you are looking for a smart drama that will make you think, than you should definitely check out this DVD."
2,Don't get all the hype,"I've been hearing critics rave about this show and finally decided to buy it instead of waiting for Netflix. I just don't get it. There are way too many characters to keep up with and I don't really care about any of them. I loved Idris Elba in ""Luther"" but he's not even a main character."
5,DO NOT buy this set unless...,"You are willing to invest 13 hours in a richly-textured, beautifully-cast and acted drama. Do not mistake this for a typical crime show. You can't just pop in the disc and expect entertainment without investing your full attention. This has the depth and detail of a well-written novel and I find myself watching each episode multiple times to absorb the nuance of the storytelling. I cannot praise this show enough. David Simon has amde a commitment to not dumbing-down his content, but it's a two-way street and you can't expect to catch little snippets of the show and understand what's going on. However, some of those little snippets are worth the price of admission themselves. Also fun to watch considering that two of the leads, Dominic West and Idris Elba are Brits, but they speak Bawlmer-style without a hitch. I have loved the Sopranos from the very first episode, but ""The Wire"" may well be the best television ever."
5,Best cop show ever,"A friend of mine recommended this series with those words, ""Best cop show ever"" and he is right. Amazingly intelligent writing and plot, every episode builds on the last and even more into season 2. Although a gritty crime series, parts of this are hilarious, especially when you know the personalities involved. When McNulty sticks it to his boss by a pure display of brilliant detective work done with the secondary purpose of embarrassing the department brass, I felt like cheering.The language here is very rough, but the series transcends it. There was one completely brilliant scene, where two detectives do Sherlock Holmes-caliber detective work on an old crime scene using only photos and a tape measure, and the only dialog for the extended 5 minute scene is ""F***"" and occasionally ""Motherf***"", yet it worked perfectly. A work of genius."
2,Dismal viewing,"Having heard enthusiatic reviews on NPR - usually an unimpeachable source - I looked forward eagerly to watching Series 1, episode 1. I tried it sober; perhaps I should have tried it drunk. Ham acting, cliched backdrops (pole-dancing was an idea already on its last legs before The Sopranos ran it into the ground)and dialogue which may possibly be realistic but certainly is dull. I labored manfully through the whole first episode. I shall not torment myself with a second."
1,Most Over Rated Show this side of Greys Anatomy...,"HBO has a history of quality programming... Six Feet Under, Deadwood, Sopranos, Curb Your Enthusiasm and Carnivale to name a few. This is NOT one of those shows. Honestly, the characters in this show are horrid at best. Cliched to the point of sighing out loud while watching alone. I honestly felt like it was a chore to sit through these episodes... This show has the same Dexter-Post-Season 1 fanbase. The show is average at best, yet receives 5-Star reviews across the board. Avoid this and True Blood as well. Both unbelievably overrated."
1,crass and foul,"The language is crass, filthy, and foul. This may represent reality, but I prefer shows that are more uplifting and honorable. Some will find this appealing, but not me."
5,Very good show the first season...,"I really enjoyed this show It only ran for 3 seasons, The first one was the best out of all them"
5,Hands Down the Best TV show I've ever seen.,"This is hands down the best TV show Ive ever seen in my life. It's real, it's gritty, there is real character development, it's unpredictable, and it really makes you think and feel. I love this show. I really don't think anything I can type here will really do it justice. Watch this show or you're truly missing out on something great."
5,The Wire first season,We have watched the first three episodes. We really like it so far. We missed it when it was on HBO the first time.
5,Calidad pero hay que pagarla :(,"Al igual que todas las series HBO, The Wire, es alta calidad! Pero claro, la calidad se paga. Gracias a Amazon por su descuento, pude comprar la 1 temporada. Espero que Amazon continue haciendo descuentos en las siguientes temporadas. Asi podré tenerlas todas a buen precio. Es una serie muy buena, pero cara :) Gracias Amazon! :)"
2,Nice acting but not so exciting,"Wanted to like it but just another ""who dunnit"". Nothing special. Maybe I should watch a few more episodes but the pilot left me not wanting to see anymore. I felt like I already saw this show when I watched NCIS, CSI NY, CSI Las vegas, BONES, Mentalist, NYPD, Blue, Blood, Cold Case, etc. You see where I am going."
4,Most def. must see,"""most def"" is a phrase repeatedly used in the wire. It is 13 hours if gangster stories and it does keep you on your toes."
3,good show but,this show is not bad but it aint no SHEILD thats for sure not to many shows can touch the sheild
3,"A pretty good show, but not as good as you'd expect.","Heres the problem with the wire-the individual parts are much greater than the sum of its parts. When you sit and watch the wire you know its important, intriguing, but you sit there waiting for the many educational parts of the show to translate into great TV, but it never does.The wire has it all- great characters, details on the drug trade, police, and so on,but the execution of the show and putting all the parts together fail to deliver the 'great' TV drama you'd expect. I will watch the next season soon and hopefully it gets better."
2,Is this it? What is all the hype about?,"I got the Wire because I thought I was missing the boat on 'the best show on TV'. Well...I must be missing something because after watching 5 episodes I don't get it. I kept thinking it was going to get better..not that it was bad...it just wasn't that interesting. The only reason I kept watching was to see Idris Elba who plays Stringer Bell cause he is a cutie! Other than that, I have no reason or intention of watching any more episodes of the Wire."
2,Story overshadowed,"I was looking for another highly rated series to watch with my boyfriend & The Wire came up. In the past our favorites have been ALIAS, SIX FEET UNDER, DEXTER & THE SOPRANOS. We watched the first 3 or 4 episodes of Season One, hoping to find another ""winner"". UGH. For the life of me, I don't get the fascination with the F-WORD!!! What's the deal?? If you have good writers, why do they depend on this word at least 5 times in every sentence? Imagine this: filming a scene & the director calls ""cut"" & says ""You left out 3 F-words"". To me, this is a sickening word, shows a limited vocabulary & I don't want to hear it over & over & over & over. If that makes me a prude, SO BE IT. It's a sad commentary."
2,episode 3 incomplete,The Wire is a great show. The copy I ordered was defective (one episode cut short). Then the next copy was shipped and part of the case was broke.
3,Dont trust the reviews. They arnt always reliable,"2 1/2 stars. i usually buy dvds if they have good reviews in the type of genre i like. Anyway, the reviews are over-rated. The acting is GREAT from the key actors. A couple of the goofy idiot cops should have been replaced. But the directing and the writing are WAY OFF. This show would really appeal gangbangers n ppl like dat. Eg.The show has a curtain lingo, if you arnt 'in the life' you probably wont get alot of whats goin on. The writers have written it in away that details of the show that are supposed to be obvious can easily be over looked.This show goes for 1 hr on its own, on dvd. no shows do that. this may be an issue with getting a time-slot. I bought this on special for $15 au. Which is about $10 US atm. No way would i pay $60 US, for a 13 episode show. ha"
1,for anyone who doesn't like this show,"sorry to tarnish this rating with 1 star but people won't read a 5 star review. Anyone who believes this series is too rough around the edges with language or the reality of the situation has to just visit baltimore to find out. I've watched it get better over the last 20 years but there are still places I dont feel comfortable. You 1 star raters that hate this series spend some time down there and watch and listen to ""actual"" people living how it is portrayed in the series.... that is all"
1,listen up!,"""The Wire"" is why TV was invented. If you haven't seen this show, you haven't seen what real TV can do. Brilliantly written, this ""novel for television"" has no peers. Season One will blow you away, and Season Two will break your heart, what's left of it. It's not about cops and drug dealers; it's about America, it's about you and where you live. It's hilarious and deeply moving, unrelenting and uncompromising.Buy this DVD and catch up with ""The Wire."" You'll never be the same."
1,extremely dull show,"I have watched 6 episodes of Season 1 and have desperately tried to get into The Wire. Despite the hype, and all the trendies saying what a mahhvellous show it is, actually it is pretty dull. Boring characters, little conflict, confusing scripts, same stuff repeated ad nauseam. Frankly, the lives of petty drug dealers in Baltimore don't do it for me, and not do the cops who are a pretty unattractive bunch with few dramatic qualities. I know that Prison Break was appallingly acted but at least it had a story line. The Wire is like an improvisation at one of those let it all hang out stage schools which never produces particularly great actors."
4,A Cut Above,"I have seen many episodes of many TV shows in my life. This show immediately got my attention with an involved episode that doesn't try to dumb things down. This show demonstrates that the writers and produces assume that their watchers are actually paying attention to what's going on, and not just gabbing it up with their buds on twitter or facebook (or even *gasp* in real life). There is quality writing, and attention to detail; I appreciate that."
4,Instantly hooked,"Starts off a little slow, as it seems most HBO series do, but my friends and I were instantly hooked. I would definitely recommend as a gift for any dude."
4,Really good show,I really enjoyed this television show. I can't wait to continue watching the subsequent seasons.
5,Best show-too bad it's over,"We love The Wire and have purchased all of the seasons available on DVD. The last season is due to come out in August and we can't wait! It's a very engaging, interesting show where nothing is tied up with a neat little bow--it's just like life. TOTALLY recommend it!"
5,The Wire,"This is an excellent show for those who want to walk the gritty Baltimore inner city street life. Some of the street language goes over my head, but it sure gives you the feeling of the constant drug battle between dealers and police. Not your normal cop show."
2,sony icf-cd2000,pro - compact; light weight; reasonably sound quality con - no universal a/c adaptor for travel; no carrying case; no cd sleep mode
2,CD player is its downfall,Nice shape and size. The speaker grill looks cool. But the CD player is the worst I have used.Does not play audio CD-Rs that even my 5 year old boombox plays effortlessly. With regular CDs the delay before the first song comes on is longer than most other CD players - upwards of 10 seconds. Occasionally fails to play even regular CDs on the first try. No sleep timer for CD.Looks like Sony slapped a mediocre CD player on to an otherwise good clock radio. BTW the clock supports 'World Time' but only as an offset to 'Local Time' in multiples of whole hours - it should have supported offsets in multiples of half-hour.
1,never worked well,"Crap. When it worked, if you closed the cover, it would short out and I would have to reset everything. It finally went out for good when I tried to set daylight savings. Since I have not been able to close the lid without the unit shorting, it could not be used as a travel clock. Usually Sony made in China crap!!!!"
2,When it works......,"...it's one of the BEST things invented. However, I have had my unit for 3+ years now and use it only for travel which I do at least once a month for days at a time. I have had this unit repaired twice (at an OUTRAGEOUS cost) due to ""fried circuitry"". I even bought a portable ""circuit-breaker-power-strip thingy"" and that didn't stop the internal stuff from frying a second time!!!On top of this, these radios are no longer being produced, but, if yours does go out, may I suggest that your purchase a used one...it'll be cheaper in the long run. (and, might I add, last as long as getting it repaired (1 year))I like Sony products ok, but repairing them is not fun. Good luck to those who have had no problems....I'm jealous"
2,Broke after a month of normal use,"Completely snapped in half after a month of normal use. Tried to super glue it back together, but it had broken near the suction cup, so it wasn't functional when the glue dried. Not worth the time/money"
5,I LOVE OMARION AND THIS BOOK,"WHOA!! WHAT CAN I SAY?? I MEAN THE NAME OMARION SAYS IT ALL RIGHT? BUT WHEN I RECEIVED THE BOOK FROM AMAZON.COM I WAS SOOOOO EXCITED TO START READING IT!! I ENJOYED EVERY PAGE OF IT ESPECIALLY THE PICTURES :=) I LOVED HOW HE LET US INTO HIS LIFE AND IT MADE U FEEL AS IF U KNEW HIM PERSONALLY (I WISH I DID lol) BUT EVERYONE WHO SAYS OR CLAIMS TO BE AN OMARION FAN, THIS BOOK MUST BE ON YOUR SHELF!!! GET THE BOOK!!! U'LL LOVE IT, TRUST ME !!! HOLLA"
5,Excellent Work,"Whoever said this was a piece of crap, is crap! Instead of looking for that HOE book you couldn't find, you came across a wonderful piece of work that lets you in on the inside look at his life from begining till end. I haven't even bought it yet and I love it. I've only read bits a pieces but I'm in love. Its a must have!"
2,Don't expect Much,"When I heard this book was coming out, I was thrilled. I thought I and other B2k fams would finally figuire out the truth on what really happened to B2K.I was wrong...very wrong. Omarion doesn't talk about many important things to me, about the group. All I get are his highschool crushes and such. which aren't too interesting to me. Omarion potrays the break up as everyone going there seperate ways is I believe is far from the truth.It's more like a picture book, with pictures on almost every page. Omarion needs to go through a bit more in life and then consider writting a autobiography. Infact I know he didn't write this all by himself not with SCUM Chris Stokes involved. He's ruined so many artist, and Omarion is just his next target. Thank god the other three boys left because I know everyone has heard of the sexual harrasment issue with T.U.G. (takin all your green.)Basically I wanted something more interesting. Thank god I just read the book in BN."
3,It Was Ok,It was an okay read. I found out some stuff about Omari that I didnt know. But it was okay I guess
5,i love omarion,i absolutely love omarion he is my world he wrote this book from the heart and i feel everyone should read it i will continue to support omarion in everything he does.love omarions1fan
1,CRAPOLA,"OMG!This is the worst piece of crap I have ever read...It's obvious that he had someone write this for him because he's not very intelligent, and it comes off as being too deep which he is not....I am sick of hearing how talented he is....how many instruments does he play??????? Personally I think he is a menace to all teenagers, who, because of him will think they too can become famous without any talent, just have good engineers in the studio to make you sound good.....He needs to stick to one thing and try to do it as best as hecan....he wouldn't make it the first day on American Idol.This book should go to all the homeless shelters to be used as toilet paper!"
2,"Life's a beach, but it's not Manly","Bad acting, bad editing, and the fact that apart from the bisexual lead boy, all the others look like they were drafted straight in from the Ugly Model Agency, make this a difficult film to plough through. If you're thinking 'Home and Away' or 'Neighbours' with gay characters, think again. It's more like Aussie Bizarro World."
3,"a ""wtf?"" movie",this is one of the movies that at the end your thinking WTF? you can't be serious. It was just a really odd movie but was pretty good. For what it is it's a fantastic movie but not my style.
1,Pitiful,"Poor production values, bad acting, very disjointed, lousy dialogue. Looks like a child filmed it. It is advertised as a romance, but there is very little romance here. All I saw was a sad, depressing movie with very few redeeming qualities."
1,One of the worst films ever made.,"If you're looking for a movie with at least a plausible plot, buy something else."
2,Better things to do...,"tla produces some of my favorite movies including Latter Days and Another Gay Movie, so when I saw this title I had high hopes for another fantastic movie. This, however, was not that movie.Some have compared it to Shelter because it involves surfers but I find the movies very different. Shelter is worth watching, for example, this movie is not. Shelter actually had a beginning, a middle, and an end; this movie -didn't.With beautiful cinematography, Tan Lines is set in a small town reachable by ferry boat. The main character, Midget shares a bed with his mother and has for the past 18 years of his life. Midget spends most of his days hanging out with his friends either getting drunk, high, or both, and surfing.The movie is basically the story of a changing point in Midget's life and how it affects the people around him.The acting isn't all that great and the pacing the movie is awkward and offbeat.It's not really worth the time and effort."
2,"Ordered new, rec'd used",The vendor posted the book as new but shipped a book that is obviously used. The pages are yellow and passages are underlined.
2,It's easier than you think...,"I wasn't too impressed with this book, but then, I'm a Buddhist monk. I thought this stuff was kind of dry. I was looking for a simple book to help some people understand Buddhism. This wasn't it for me, but maybe you would like it."
4,"Well, It is really harder than you think","Sylvia Boorstein's It's Easier Than You Think: The Buddhist Way to Happiness actually does the opposite of what the title states.Boorstein wants to illustrate the main precepts of Buddhist practice and understanding, but she also wants to show what an actual spiritual or religious life look like on the ground. A spiritual path does not solve your problems; you will not be a completely different person after you embrace a spiritual path than before. Buddhist practice will slow down those natural tendencies that you have. It will give you the ability to r***** your natural reactions to situations, especially those that cause pain or stress, and examine them in a differently.In this way, a spiritual or religious path is actually harder than we think. We still grapple with our old selves. We still strive to defeat our terrible impulses. But we do so with a mirror held up to them, and the tools to try and defeat them."
5,Chicken Soup for the Buddhist (or Non-Buddhist) Soul,"I was introduced to this book while staying with a friend, and I was hooked. I went home and bought it so that I could finish it. I didn't know much about Buddhism before I read this book. Ms. Boorstein's stories read a bit like the Chicken Soup for the Soul books. She has short wonderful stories that demonstate current day people practicing the Buddha's teachings. You do not need to be a Buddhist to appreciate this book! It's very inspirational. Since this book, I have read several more books to learn about the teachings of Buddha."
3,Reader's Digest Buddhism,"A lot of the basics of vanilla buddhism are here, in a form palatable to the shortest of attention spans. I found Sylvia Boorstein's work personable, though somewhat dull (perhaps I should say ""peaceful""). If you are one with little time free for deep thought outside of your current focuses, this is an easy way to gain a snapshot of western Buddhism. It might even be helpful, for in the manner of the three-word phrase, ""Buddhism is Buddhism"". Those of you with more time and more interest have many more choices for your reading pleasure, such as Suzuki's ""Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind"". Ms. Boorstein is not to be discounted, and although this isn't the best book I've ever read, it is a labor of love. So if you're flying cross-country, this definitely beats airplane movies."
4,It easier than you think :),"Good read to give you a refresher on a buddhist approach to living. Not an in depth read, but realistic references made to everyday examples."
4,A very good TCP/IP book,"This book provides a very good study of TCP/IP in the context of Windows 2000. While the authors' style in on the dry side (How do you make this stuff exciting?); this is a VERY good book. The resource kit does have a book dealing with TCP, but its discussion is at a higher level - how is TCP/IP implemented in Windows 2000. The view there is from Windows to TCP/IP. This is a more general TCP/IP book with the emphasis from TCP/IP to Windows 2000. As a technical instructor and Windows NT and 2000 administrator, I refer to this book for low level disscusions of the protocol to clarify and explain the behavior of my systems."
3,A boring series,"I was almost tempted to give this book 2 stars but I only do that to really, really bad books.Like the 1st book in the series, this book was too long word wise. Too many useless description, too little interesting plot movement. Unfortunately, this one didn't even had interesting characters like the 1st one.There's little good to say about this book. There were a few good scenes but not good enough to make the book remotely readable. This series looked & sounded so intriguing I couldn't wait to read it. I'm very disappointed & feel cheated - a feeling I'm not used to when reading DL.After about 180 pages, I just scanned the rest to get it over with."
5,Hell of a voice!,"i am a huge Glenn Jones fan, even when he was starting out with Norman Conners back in the day. this brother is so underrated! Finesse is the main song i wanted in CD form. i have a cassette tape with this song but i needed to have a CD version. show me will always get the bedroom sizzling!"
2,"Glenn Jones ""Finess""","Dont fall for the advertisment, like I did that marketed this as new music! This is one of Glenn's earlier 1980's....save your money and buy it used!!!"
3,I don't know what to think,I bought this perfume based on others reviews more or less. I have received compliments and I have also been told by people close to me it smells like a church or just generally bad. The weird thing is some days I think it smells good and other days I am not so sure. So overally Im not as pleased with this scent as I thought I would be but it is a unique scent compared to other perfumes I owned I guess its more a personal preference.
3,"Good in some ways, lacking in others","I picked this up in a supermarket when I was on a vacation - just wanted something to read poolside.It was good but, as one other reviewer commented, it had unbelievable plot solutions that were just to neatly packaged and presented.Plus it is a little insulting to the reader to present this one guy who just so happens to cross paths with and have exciting adventures with so many noteworthy people and events of the wild west. He's like the Forest Gump of cowboys - there he is one stage with Johnson getting a medal, here he is creating the advertising tagline for Nike...I like to really read a story and get pulled in - this one encouraged me to skim quite a few pages."
2,Misses The Mark,"""The Dawn of Fury"" should be retitled ""Yawn of Fury"".Purchased this as an ebook after reading reviews. Most gave it high marks. After two hundred pages I gave up. Not what I thought it would be, a good old western. The book started out fine and then it went down hill. Just plain boring page after page. Have read other Ralph Compton books but by different authors that were much better and held my interest, not this one. Time to move on."
3,Solid Collection of 70's Action Adventure Cop Dramas,Nice solid & professional collection of some of the best known British soundtrack composers. It's nowhere near as much fun as the EASY TEMPO or the BEAT AT CINECITTA collections - but it's a solid collection.
3,"Good Primer text, not for knowledgeable technicians","Mastering Active Directory provides the framework to understand and set up the Active Directory system. However, it covers Active Directory in more general theoretical terms and does not do a thorough job of detailing how to plan and implement the system. If you are unfamiliar with NDS or other Directory Services, the LDAP protocols and similar then this book is a good place to start. If you are already familiar with such things then you will find this book to be lacking in useful information. My recommendation would be to purchase the book if you are new to the whole Directory concept and read it as a foundational text and then graduate to a more detailed text, such as Windows Active Directory Design and Deployment, before actually implementing Active Directory or attempting to resolve problems with it. For someone who already understands the concepts they should just go ahead and move to the above mentioned book and skip this one."
1,The worst Active Directory book on the market,"This is, with no doubt in my mind, the worst book on Active Directory I have seen. I can't believe Sybex decided to publish the second edition (let alone the first) with all errors and such superficial coverage of practically every Active Directory topic. I'm under impression that its author had no practical experience in dealing with any real Active Directory deployment. If you are serious about learning Active Directory from experts, check ""Mission Critical Active Directory"" by Jan De Clercq and Micky Balladelli (Digital Press) or ""Windows 2000 Active Directory"" by Alistair Lowe-Norris (O'Reilly)."
1,I didn't want a novel. Didn't want to read about win2000 AD.,"Robert writes well and is very entertaining, but I'm here to learn AD for window server 2003, not AD for window 2000 server. I was patient because I thought he was laying the ground work for the practical details for AD window 2003 but not only was it not detailed, but it was about AD window 2000. UNBELIEVABLE!!!"
2,"Too much emphasis on theory, not enough hands on","The beginning of the ninth chapter is over 200 pages into the book and it begins like this. ""Many people who read reference manuals such as this one often want to start ""doing"" right away, rather than read through the explanations until a complete understanding is in place beforetaking any action."" Anyone who reads through the first 8 chapters will have become more than just a little impatient at the repetitive and long winded theoretical concepts that could have been scaled down to 2 chapters. Building on a theoritcal foundation is essential. However, way too much time and energy is focused in this area IMO."
2,It is Too Conceptual,"I bought the book because of the word ""Mastering"" in the title. The first five chapters are on X.500, NDS, and NT Domain background. A few hundred more pages guide you with pictures through simple configurations within the mmc. I was expecting more in the way of sysvol, registry, and AD integration into NT Server. I was also hoping for a more detailed guide to AD design and migration... which is probabaly what 98% of Active Directory book buyers want.Next time I'll start with the Windows 2000 Resource Kit first. Most of the answers are there.-=Chris"
1,Nothing to Master...,In my opinon this book is simply theory and it references to often to things you have read ten pages earlier over and over again. The real important things in here are sort of missing.If you are looking for a handson book avoid this title. It gets frustrating the more pages you have read.
5,Soul bossa Trio's music is latin and jazzy.,"I brought all serious of Soul Bossa Trio's CD when I was in Japan, what I should say is, most of the tunes appears on this CD for releasing in U.S., is taken from their debut and the 2nd CD. (Currently they have 7 issues in Japan.) When I first knew this group and heard their music, I was surprised they came from Japan, music is full of latin and jazzy, I specially like one track ""ain't no sunshine"" which the arrangement is absolutely fresh and impressed. If you have a party, this CD is also for putting into the dance floor too. If you're hestiated to pick this CD, is definitely your miss. Get it now and tell me if you have the same comments as mine after listened."
5,Amazing release from a previously unknown band!,"I never heard of this band until somehow linked to this page on Amazon, and man am I ecstatic or what! Norther are an amazing band. The greatest strength of this band lies in the combination of its sick and I mean SICK lead guitar melodies intertwined with the insane keyboard licks. Children of Bodom? I wouldn't actually UNDERRATE this band by comparing them to COB. I'd say more like Finland's version of Dark Tranquillity, with less rock/death/big riffs and more black atmosphere. The songwriting here is magnificant as is the musicianship. The only thing that can be improved upon is the production, which seems inferior to Amorphis and Sentenced, two big Finnish metal bands.5 out of 5 for the pure fact that I had never heard of this band before, and I have now, and am completely BLOWN AWAY.Two words: GET IT!"
3,Interesting read but...,"Let me start by saying that the contents of this book are something every woman in your life should read.The problem is getting past the first 50 or so pages. Some of the writing is very dry with points being repeated quite often.It is by no means an easy read but again, the information contained within makes it worth the effort.A good technical look at the dark side of humanity but not your everyday page turner."
2,The Gift of Fear,"It feels like an article on fear rather than a fiction novel. While it can be informative, it reads like an Op Ed piece."
5,The gift of fear,"A very interesting and useful book. Teaches us to be aware of our surroundings, use good judgement, and be able to identify potentially dangerous situations."
3,Some interesting information,"Parts of this book were very interesting, but at times I found myself speed reading to get through. There is some good information to be gleaned from this book. There is also a fairly obvious gun bias.I think the most valuable information I took was some suggested interview questions for potential employees, and some great questions parents should ask about safety in their child's schools. All in all, it was worth reading as I think I will give my instincts more credit."
3,"Somewhat useful,but...","This book has an interesting theme but ultimately falls on it's literary face with regard to practical & really useful information. It's quite telling that De Becker informs us of what he calls PINS (pre incident indicators),but then proceeds to inform the reader of the futility of such legalities as Tempory Restraining Orders & confronting one's tormentor/stalker/abuser,etc. He's also unabashadly anti self defense(specificly legally owned firearms.) Message? Run & hide or better-hire his services. My recommendation for any person being stalked,threatened,or harassed? Get a concealed carry firearm permit (the majority of states have them,now),get a handgun you can handle proficiently,get instruction at a good firearms training school such as Lethal Force Institute,Gunsite,etc,and get back to living your life. Or,cower in fear."
4,Every woman and law enforcement officer should read this.,"I have been in police work for about 15 years, part of it in crime prevention and part working as a school resource officer. This book is a must read for anyone who has a goal of helping others. If you want to be proactive about keeping loved ones safe or learning how to predict violence read this book. I enjoyed the insight about JACA and the ploys men play to con women into trusting them.If you are a woman working with domestic violence related issue, read this book. It will broaden your overall outlook on investigating these issues. Are you a school resource officer? Read this book. It has a great section on kids and violence."
3,It's Ok,"I wouldn't recommend it. If you have an instinct, you don't need this book. It's really more of a pat on the back for Gavin de Becker, BY Gavin himself."
1,deceipt,I paid $21.98 for a paperbook tiny book with print I can't even read. It's totally a ripoff!!!I would never order a book that I can't even read the print much less pay that price for it!!!
1,The Gift of Greed,"This book is written by the same self-serving guy who developed a computer program to help profile kids at risk of going berserk in schools. Only problem is, he didn't do any scientific validation of his work. There are steps one needs to follow to prove the reliability and validity of such tools, and he skipped them.Now De Becker wants you to pay him to explain the obvious point that you should listen to your intuition when you think you aren't safe. My intuition tells me that no one's wallet is safe from this guy."
2,You Shouldn't Need a Book to Tell You This,"This book may be a useful read for many, but we really shouldn't need a book to tell us what he's trying to say. He just reiterates simple common sense that says, ""Trust and Follow your instincts"".The author writes with a liberal political agenda. He's anti-2nd Ammendment and pro-choice and this is displayed in the book. It would have been nice if he could have left the politics out.He does gets knocked down a couple of stars for his view on guns. He has let a personal experience with a psycho family member cloud his judgement. He also manages to repeat the fact that you are something like 47 times more likely to be kill with a gun if one is in your house. Which is a true statistic, ...if your whole clan is runnin' dope.Be sure to read Paxton Quigley's ""Armed and Female"" along with this book to get a balanced perspective on whether the decision to protect yourself with a firearm is right for you."
1,InStilling Fear is more like it,I hated this book. It may be well written but this is not a gift. This book just makes you more scared to live in this world. If something is going to happen to you it will. If you read books like this you will just be paranoid and be looking around the corner all the time looking for something to happen and then you know what something will happen. Best to leave these kinds of books on the store shelf. Learn the Gift of love instead of fear.
3,A Troubling View Of Society,"The author heads a security agency that supports Government agencies, public figures, and private citizens. Mr. de Becker discusses the violence that his agency fights: terrorism, attempted assassinations, death threats, rapes, stalkings, domestic violence, child abuse, and children who shoot their parents. Mr. de Becker discusses why people perform these violent acts, how the authorities attempt to prevent these violent acts, and warning signals that precede these violent acts.Mr. de Becker's book is troubling because it is an ""Encyclopedia of Violent Acts"" that immerses the reader in fear. Mr. de Becker does list advance signals indicating *when* individuals should fear for their safety, an extremely useful discussion. But many of Mr. de Becker's examples concern public figures who purposefully maintain high media visibility (e.g., celebrities and government officials). These illustrative examples do not always represent the life of a private citizen."
3,Ehhh.....,"There were bits and pieces that I found interesting but it was a chore to finish. A lot of this, most of it actually, is what I consider common sense when out and about living life.I think it may help some people but I couldn't help but feel that the information in this book is something that most people would know or recognize when they interact with others."
4,Thought It Would be Stupid. Nope.,"I received the book as a gift, and was immediately annoyed--the way I am when someone sends me one of those horrible email forwards that details the latest way rapists are attacking. My gut reaction was absolutely off base. The book is -fascinating-, filled with detail on how to determine if someone is blowing off steam or really a threat to your life. The author is authoritative and has a huge amount of experience to draw on. It's worth reading just for the stories, but I also learned a lot about how to feel more comfortable when I'm alone. Don't let the shiny, raised-letter covering fool you. This is a great gift for yourself."
5,A GREAT COMMENTARY ON HUMAN NATURE - NOT JUST FOR WOMEN,"I hesitated to read this book at first, thinking it was entirely about the victimization of women. A friend convinced me it was a good read and once I picked it up, I couldnt put it down. De Becker shows through a series of examples that people have come to ignore the basic human instict of survival. By ignoring fear, we open ourselves to those that would do us harm. Women and Men constantly put themselves in danger all in the name of manners. De Becker shows that it is better to appear rude on occassion that to be a target of violence.The subject matter is captivating. The writing style lends itself to a quick read. De Becker drives home his point with chilling examples rather than bore the reader to tears with meaningless psycho babble. It is an excellent commentary on human nature and the violence that is increasingly permeating into our society. Definately worth picking up."
4,Must read for your own protection,"Easy to understand, topics are well explained and everyone can relate to it.It reduces unnecessary fear and increases confidence to trust intuition.Depicting interesting stories this book almost reads like a thriller at times without the side effect of creating anxiety, but you certainly want to keep reading. Cleverly written. Thank you.I am a female who experienced the signs of being stalked, thanks to the book my knowledge and confidence has increased and no one, not even myself, can deceive me in this issue and I now know how to react in critical situations."
5,Being Safe Isn't What We Thought,"Gavin deBecker has done us a great service with this book. That most of us will not follow all his advice is a shame, but even if 10% of what he recommends is followed our level of safety will rise and our anxiety levels drop. Why is it that the smoker who is sixty pounds overweight finds flying so terrifying? deBecker helps us understand that the fear he feels is false (his chances of dying from a heart attack are a thousand times more likely than dying in a plane crash) and helps us really know what fear can and cannot help us avoid."
2,The Gift of Fear,I found this book hard to read and hard to follow. It seems that it could have said alot more simply.
2,Too much anti-gun rhetoric I hear...,"I'm so glad I've read the reviews here, as I almost bought this book; seems like it may have good thoughts on crime prevention, but...I don't care to read a liberal's rambling about guns causing crime. Guns are tools; if a bad person uses one for evil, it doesn't make the gun evil...the criminal is responsible for his/her actions. It should be noted that guns are the ultimate form of self protection...as the saying goes ""God created man, Sam Colt made them equal""."
1,The gift of stupidity,"This book is nothing more than random foolishness that plays to the insecurities of people, in particular women. Randomly fearing everything is more likely to make you a victim than keep you safe. Basically, provides no insight into how to avoid dangerous situations and people - just focuses on making the reader scared of everyone and every situation. I truly wonder if there is any truth in the stories and scenarios put forth. Mind you, there are lots of Ted Bundy types out there - but this book gave you no guidance on identifying the truly bad folks and providing any survival strategies."
4,Good Read,"The book contains some very useful information, including the lists of markers to predict violent behavior and the discussion of fear vs. worry. What's not useful is the psychobabble, of which there is a good amount. The author is an acolyte of Oprah Winfrey, so it's not surprising that the usual prejudices are in play -- anti-gun-ownership, ripping of American culture, and moral relativism. These distractions are easily skipped over, however. All in all, a good read, but be prepared to do some flipping."
5,The Gift of Fear,"I can say that I found this to be the book that empowered me to finally be able to make a final break from my abuser. And to not have to ""keep your enemies close"". I would recommend anyone to read this even if you do not have an antagonistic situation at present. It can give you what you need to make sure you do not give your power away and if for some reason you do how to recapture it. There are great tools and examples of how to read where a person is in ""running their tapes"". And you can know when things are about to accelerate before they actually do. A great tool in staying safe in a violent world."
4,Recommended Reading,"I have recommended this book to several people in a professional and personal capacity! There is some good information inside and it makes you think about paying attention to your minds warnings! I purchased the audiobook, so I was able to listen while commuting which made it even better!"
5,Good Book,"I think this book had a lot of insight into remembering how to use our instincts. The author does talk about himself a lot and that part gets pretty boring. I found that basically the second CD is all you need and CDs 1 and 3 are basically just fluff. But besides that, i really did enjoy CD 2 and i am glad i purchased it."
5,a must read for everyone - male or female,"Gavin de Becker's book is so informative, engaging and intense. After reading the book, you will be well equipped to deal with potentially dangerous situations. I feel so much safer now because I know how to read people better; rely on my intuition more and know how to avoid bad situations.This book is not meant to scare - its purpose is to empower- and you will feel empowered. He takes the ""mystery"" and ""unpredictability"" out of violent people. Excellent! One of the few books I'll read more than once."
4,In-depth view of dangerous men,"Gavin De Becker gives a fascinating view of the psyche of truly dangerous men (and women), along with signals to recognize them. His position as one who has provided protection to stalkers' intended victims provided insight into what works -- and what doesn't. His research on ""why"" will leave you better prepared to avoid evil and recognize safety."
5,"Make a gift out of this book. Every woman and teenager should own this, oh and dad's.","Great book!!! I learned so much about myself and others and I am looking forward to sharing this with everyone and most of all sharing it with every woman, girl and parent to be."
5,A Must Read . . . Especially Now,"First read this book after seeing de Becker on Oprah. Recommend it to everyone, especially women, to recognize signs of dangerous situations from friend or stranger. Excellent insight from author who knows about protecting people in high places and real world situations with none of the psycho-babble of so-called experts. Very current with the recent theater and school shootings. Should be required reading with eyes wide open by parents, teachers and those with any qualms about someone in their life. Not written to scare you but to sharpen your awareness. Worth having both the print version and Kindle e-Book with more up-to date info."
5,The Gift of Fear,Excellent book! It's a book that really helps people to recognize their emotions to help them stay safe. Recommend highly!
4,gift of fear,i have read this book several times. four yeas ago and today. my mind took in and retained different aspects of it. i have 2 hard copies and the e-version . crazy but i write in one and preserve the other. ereading keeps it at my finger tips. refer this book all the time the other one 48 laws of power.
4,A Must Read for those who want to be more Safety Savvy,"Gavin de Becker empowers readers with his extensive knowledge and research on violent behavior like no one else. His detailed work can teach anyone that violence does not just happen randomly. But how there are clues in every unsafe situation with strangers, stalkers, or threatening people we can pick up on.This is a must read for anyone who is frustrated on what to do about violence and wants to 'stack the deck' in their favor when it comes to the ultimate protection of themselves and their loved-ones in today's society."
4,Wake Up and Smell the Danger,"We in the civilized world spend a great deal of time and effort insulating ourselves from our instincts. We try to be open and friendly with strangers in the mistaken belief that this will strengthen our position within the circle of like-minded civilized people. We teach girls and women to not offend others, to act in a warm and loving manner, to be ""nice."" We disarm ourselves and call it a virtue. We beat our swords into plowshares. We value ""trust.""We are idiots.The Gift of Fear will open a few eyes--not enough, but a few. Buy it. But it now. Read it. Twice. Give it to your family and friends, anybody you care about. Buy a carton of them as stocking stuffers. You won't agree with every word De Becker writes, but you'll decrease your odds of becoming yet another preventable crime statistic."
4,A few extremely good lessons in an overly verbose book.,"Gavin De Becker has written an important set of lessons in this book. Unfortunatly it is almost lost in the mess of ego that dominates virtually every chapter. The good points in this book are extremely valuable and thought provoking and ultimately worth the anguish of the read. I know I have used issues raised in this book as topics of discussion with several friends, both male and female. It is just such a shame that one has to endure De Becker's self rightous, listen-to-me-because-I-know-better-than-anyone tone to get the insight he offers. This book would be an excellent candidate for an abridged version."
3,Just OK,This book was recommended to me by a friend. It was a lot of pages and words telling you to trust your first impressions or instincts.
2,the gift of fear,"I expected a lot more from this given some of the hype on the internet. Some of the advice comes close to victim blaming. Otherise it is very intersting though, and not too bad a read."
1,Not what I expected,"I thought this book would be more applicable to everyday interactions. But, really I think is about street smarts and more unusual situations.Would like my teens to get the lessons from the book but frankly found it too frightening to recommend to a younger reader."
1,Once again Oprah poisons the public,"The author states a lot of statistics and makes a lot of assertions thoughout the book, but I didn't see a list of sources cited anywhere. Just a bunch of pompous drivel and advertisements for his 'security firm', and a bunch of political stuff that had little to do with the topic. A lame article on wikipedia has higher standards than the author and publisher of this book. I'm a little angry I paid for this. I'm usually good about avoiding most of what Oprah recommends as it's usually unscientific wishy washy crap. Hey ladies, don't trust creepy dudes. There, I just saved you 300+ painful pages.I have the Kindle version of this book. I don't know if the hard copy has proper citations, but I doubt it."
4,The Gift of Fear,"My Mom & Dad purchased copies of this book for themselves and for each of their children after hearing about it on Oprah. I am presently reading it and have found it very interesting. The author gives specific examples, using the names and stories of real people, who were victimized because they did not listen to their ""gut feelings"". By recreating the scenes in their minds, the author helps the victims scrutinize and pinpoint the things to which they should have paid closer attention. These ""sub-conscious"" red flags are then shared with the reader."
5,The Gift of Fear - Gavin De Becker,"De Becker has provided and intensive look at violence and it's precursors in the intensely patriarchal society we live in now. this is a must read for all women and men as well. He has help for many, many types of situations which may arise in our lives.It's an extremely well-written book and moves along nicely. He gave me definitions, a list, for the first time of the types of people I've been attracting all my life and how to recognize the signs of the abuser, both emotional and physical. It helped me spot a potentially troublesome situation which arose shortly after I finished the book!I cannot recommend this book highly enough"
5,De Becker is a genious.,"I think that this book was really great. I think that the author is great at relating statistics to an everyday person. He makes things a lot easier than a huge number of statistics that you can not relate to, instead he will say for example that A woman is being beat by her husband right now as you read this review, and another is being beat right now, and again now. That is a lot more understandable than a huge number that one hears by a statistical analysis."
5,Very interesting!,"I really enjoyed this book! I borrowed it from a friend and after I read the first two chapters I ordered my own book plus two more for each of my sons! It covered a lot of different scenarios. Danger from strangers, spouses, boyfriends and others. The book explained The techniques used by perpetrators of violence and recommended strategies to deal with stalkers."
5,a must read for females-be aware of your inner voice and trust it.,"It is a hard read, the book arrived in mint condition. It is a must read for women"
2,So So reading,"This book was reccomended to me by a friend and I really looked forward to reading it. I found that the ideas of the author on being aware of our surroundings and using instincts and intuition to stay safe are very valid. I was hoping for more case studies and real-life examples of how people have either suceeded or failed regarding the use of, or not, these tactics. This book so far has read more like a text book than a book that holds my interest. I admit I have not finished it, but but it down. I will go back to it and hope to find what I am looking for."
4,Follow your gut instincts,"A excellent book. He could have used more examples in the book from real life, rather than threats to celebrities and famous people. However the main focus of the book, telling people that they need to trust their instincts is true. Being in law enforcement I know that the little ""hunches"" that we have often are the only thing we have to go on to stay safe."
4,Fearless,"Excellent! Filled with useful knowledge about both yourself and the twisted yet strangely smooth running society around us all. A recommend read to everyone, from those nervous nellies we all know to Mr cool and collective."
5,Great book on trusting yourself,"I read the book at the library and just had to get it when I saw it on the kindle. If you're a parent, then you should encourage your teenager read this book!. Helps you train yourself from doubting your gut feelings and may prevent tragedies."
5,A must read for everyone. It could save your life.,"I was totally engrossed in this book, once I started reading it. It was very educational and eye opening to learn how my mind was telling me things important things that I was choosing to ignore. I couldn't put it down."
5,A must read for every teen girl.,"This book is a must read for every woman. I read it years ago but bought this copy for our daughter. She, too, was enlightened and educated. This valuabe information will stay with you."
5,Outstanding,"If you have always wondered why you get a certain feeling about someone or something, this book explains it all. Trust your instincts! Everyone young and old should read this."
4,Over and Over,"An interesting and informative book on survival instincts and profiling, not only criminal but every day behavior. The author does tend to beat his chest more than should be necessary. Some of the information is repeated over and over but overall it is a good book. RECOMMENDED."
4,A Great Life Tool,"This book has been very helpful to me; I re-read it every couple of years as a refresher. I do a lot of work with the homeless/criminal population in my town and the book was a primer in knowing when I am being conned, or worse, am in danger. No longer do I feel guilty when I refuse to be put in a vulnerable situation with someone who just doesn't ""feel right"". Not wanting to hurt someone's feelings is not worth putting yourself in danger. It also allows me to better enjoy the people with whom I do feel comfortable.My only complaint is I found the sections about famous people interesting, but not very relevant to me. When I recommend the book to friends I often advise them that they can skip that part.A must-read, especially for women!"
5,excellent,I received the book in mint condition and well before the expected arrival date. Excellent read and I have no problems with the seller!
5,One of the Most IMPORTANT Books I've EVER Read.,"I purchased this book in paperback and CD format at two different times. Gavin De Becker does a brilliant job of explaining why heeding your internal warnings is so critical. He gives many examples of crime invetigations where victims had a ""bad feeling"" and didn't trust their ""gut"" and unfortnately, should have listened to their inner voice. He gives these feelings solid credibility time and time again. Then, he wraps up his thoughts about these feelings with the attitude like... so what if a stranger thought you were overly cautious or weird, who cares? You don't know them!Ted Bundy didn't look scary either... he was a handsome lawyer hanging out in Florida when I was on my way to college. This is a great book to own, to read and re-read.Mr. De Becker is serious, credible and knows from personal experience for which he speaks and teaches."
5,It is a book everyone should consider reading.,"Much of it I already knew. Some of it was new to me. Some of it hepled me to understand myself and my enviroment better, I.E. putting someof the puzzle together. It is a very good book. There should be a class offered in local colleges using this book as the text book."
1,Fear sells and WE are buying (unfortunately),"I had hoped that this book might contain some practical advice about techniques that people could use to be more aware of their surroundings and the clues that may let them know that they are in a dangerous situation.What I got was a diatribe about what a terrifying world we live in, backed up by statistics that the author doesn't bother to back up or provide sources for in any way. And many of the statistics that the author recklessly spews are easy to look up and falsify! I guess that Mr. De Becker forgot that discerning, responsible readers could use a simple search engine to fact check his claims about the numbers of sexual assaults, rapes, murders, etc and find them to be very, very wrong. Mr. De Becker appears to have just made up the numbers induce ""fear"" in his readers.If you buy Mr. De Becker's book you will be the victim of crime, the crime of fraud! And Mr. De Becker is the perpetrator."
2,Anti Gun,I wish I would have been aware of the serious bias against using a gun for self defensein this book before purchasing.The intuition aspects are decent though long winded.
3,Identies the problem but fails to provide a solution,"This is an excellent book as far as it goes. However, to learn how to hide your home address, you need to read JJ Luna's book ""How to be Invisible."" It shows you what to do when a stalker is after you, so that you can hide from him forever.How to Be Invisible: The Essential Guide to Protecting Your Personal Privacy, Your Assets, and Your Life (Revised Edition)"
4,Excel! Intro To The Body-Mind Intuitive Responses To Danger,"This book clearly details the intuitive responses to impending danger. It teaches us to value our own gut-feelings to the people and situations around us. It guides us to recognize the mistakes of not following our own most innate reactions. It is the intellectual introduction for those who have never experienced violence but wish to prepare for it mentally. Furthermore, it allows those who have experienced it to gain clarity and to defeat confusion by offering tales that these people can easily relate to."
2,another disappointment,"De Becker has some valuable insight, but he is verbose, and his insight is buried under a mountain of words. This bood is at least twice as long as it needs to be. So far, the best book I've read in this genre is Rory Miller's Facing Violence. He says, or hints at, everything de Becker says, but he's clear, and concise. Get Miller's book instead."
1,You'll have to see it to believe it.,"I don't quite know how to explain this video. It has three featurettes, two Baby Burlesks and a glimpse of Shirley Temple Black's wedding. The Baby Burlesks are--well, to a person who doesn't know what they're in for, it can be pretty harsh. I mean, it's cute, but strange that they would let toddlers do these things. They're take-offs of movies of the 1930s. I guess you would have to be from that time to really understand everything and get the jokes, but I guess it's kinda scary because I read that the Baby Burlesks producers didn't pay the children as much as they had promised and were cruel to them and had many dangerous scenes which the parents couldn't know about! I don't know this is true, but if it is, I don't really enjoy watching these shorts. I rates it only 1 star. The stories, I'm sorry to say after all the negative things I've said that the stories aren't very good. So if you want to buy this movie, you'd better be ready and armed."
2,"""The Worst of Shirley Temple""","This video contains practically nothing! I personally own this video (I received it as a birthday present) and personally hate it. The back cover is very dishonest because it says clips and inside features from Shirley Temple's first wedding-the clips are only 40 seconds. The video also contains ""Pardon my Pups"" and ""Kid in Africa""-I have these films or shorts on tons of other Shirley videos. Don't waste your money!"
5,"5 stars for ""The Tush People""","There are four tushies in our home and each one loves reading ""The Tush People."" Our youngest tushie insists on reading it each night before going to bed and reads it to each new tush who enters our home. Your tush is big hit in our home. Your book has turned reading into a pleasure instead of achore.Linda F. Radke, author ""Promote Like a Pro: Small Budget, Big Show."""
4,Interesting Insight from an Outsider,"I bought Mr. Spaceman because of the novelty of the plot. It sounded quirky and fun and I hadn't read anything by the author despite the fact that I have seen his work in quite a few bookstores. I am very glad that I picked it up - this was a very honest look at American life at the turn of the millennium. Lives seen through the naive eyes of an outsider. Well concieved and written. And while lives and cultures are being examined, the author makes no value judgements; he leaves it to the reader to interpret.Bottom line: great read. I wish there was a 4 and a half star rating...I'm stingy with my 5's but this one is almost there."
3,"good premise, lousy conclusion","Mr. Spaceman reads well until the conclusion. By turns it is witty and profound, working out a marvelous set of parallels with the story of Christ. (Desi the Spaceman even has a last supper with his ""twelve apostles."") But the novel degenerates into a paean for the author's favorite city that fails to bring the themes of the work to completion."
2,They Whisper is much better,"I met Robert Olen Butler in Portland, Oregon after having read and been impressed with They Whisper. I picked Mr. Spaceman up hoping for more of the same. Although I liked the portrayal of Desi, I found the premise for the story unoriginal and was disconcerted by the religious/Christian overtones, which were overplayed in my opinion. For better works, read They Whisper or Tabloid Dreams."
2,A View of Earth In One Dimension,"This book is an interesting idea executed in a way that makes one yearn to be through with it. The entire first half is especially dragging. The interviews with the various charachters were the parti liked least. They all seemed so one dimensional. It finally started to pick up in the last half when the interview segments ended and they had their meal together with the best part of the book being the comic relief provided by one of his ""guests"" who belives him to be god. The most grating charachter is his wife Edna with her constant refrain of ""Oh My Spaceman.""The most disappointing thing about this book for me however was the ending. It is a complete cop out in my opinion. A spaceman is living in New Orleans and no one notices. I think someone might. But I wish I wouldn't have noticed this book."
3,Boom or Bust???,"Endless ramblings/obvious allegory/weak conclusion. This is not a humour piece nor sci-fi and has little value as a fiction piece for entertainment. Having said that, this novel has definite merit for school study. It is an exellent piece to provoke discussion and should be on a mandatory reading list for English and Psyc students.I rate this as a 1 if your looking for a casual entertaining read. I suggest you keep away and stick with your blockbuster story writers.I rate this as a 5 if you want a book for a reading club and are ready for potentially intense dialoque."
1,What WAS this?,This came from a Pulitzer Prize winner? Another book that has a fine use of the 'f' word which apparently no one can write a book without these days. Is anyone else sick of the trash that's being written lately?
4,Vocabulearn Tagalog: Level 1,I found this 2 disc collection to be very helpful. Gives you so many words. It teaches from both sides English to Tagalog and Tagalog to English. I work in a office so I was able to download to my computer and can listen and learn while doing my daily work at the same time. I have found it most helpful.Thank you[...]
5,Magic School Bus Explores the Rainforest,I really like all of the Magic School Bus series. Kids can learn a lot about a subject and the dialog is very amusing.
5,A must read GEM,"The first time I heard about Satan it was when I started my quest into Linux tools. I found Satan "" the fixed release for Linux"" I tried it !!! but never do things at 100%. When I read the Book....suddenly all changed..I have discovered the hidden side of Sys Adminz. I stopped hacking and now I'm working on the right direction. I'm on my way to code "" LUCIFER"" a Satan-Like software."
5,Loved it!,"Being a Niner fan, this was a great compliment to my kitchen. It's made of glass and is definitely an upgrade over my previous acrylic cutting board. Would recommend!"
4,fuzzy book,The book I ordered for my Grandson was exactly what I wanted. The baby loves it. We received the book very quickly. Thanks for everything
5,Quality Product,Took about 20 minutes to remove old intake and install the K&N. Easy to follow instructions. All hardware was easy to identify. Unit adds the deeper sound and improves mid range acceleration. Looks great. This is an example of a very well made American quality product.
4,Great book for understanding site occupancy modeling,"I think this is a pretty good book. It is the only reference on this relatively new type of patch occupancy modeling. It is mainly focused on the models of MacKenzie et al. and the Royle and Nichols model. This is a great place to start if you know nothing about this method or a good reference for advanced users.This book does not fill the need of an introductory ""how-to"" book. If you want to know how to set up models and run them in program PRESENCE or MARK you will need to wait. Such a book does not exist. This is not a cookbook, but a compilation of the theory and an explanantion of the methodology behind occupancy estimation."
5,Robust Wildlife Species Distribution Modeling Tool,"This book gathers the most recent improvements for wildlife species presence absence models, a recurrent problem in ecology research. In a brilliant way, MacKenzie and his co-authors present the results of their last papers and discuss in a didatic manner the applications of simple improvements in statistical models that make them more than usefull for field ecologists, decision makers and others interested in biodiversity conservation."
1,"Curly Hair, BEWARE....","Why trade off a COMPLETE shave for a close shave? Sure enough, you will get a close shave, but if all of your facial hair does not grow at a perfect 90 degree angle to your face, you will NEVER get a complete shave. I bought this thing hoping to save time in the morning shaving and cleaning the razor. In the past (and now present) I've always used the Norelco ROTARY electric shaver. Having curly hair, the rotary razor does a decent job, no more than three strokes to shave ALL the hair in any given area.The Braun ""360 Complete"" is pure marketing hype. It takes 3 x's longer, leaving my face sore and hot, and I would still have to touch up many visible hairs with my old Norelco! The auto cleaner is not smart. Cleaning cycle based on battery wear, not the condition of the razor. If you have curly facial hair, buy anything else."
2,"Good razor, but will stop using Braun going forward...","I have been using Braun razors for many years, each time upgrading to their newer and more expensive technology. After buying this razor, I will change brands and go with Panasonic for the future. The main reason is the HUGE and ridiculous 'Clean and Renew' system that comes with these shavers. The razor does not make good contact while in the cradle so the only way to charge it is to plug the cord directly into the razor and not the base. Also because the razor does not make proper contact, the cleaning system will start and then abruptly shut off leaving a dirty, alcohol-wet razor. The whole idea of having to buy cleaning cartridges is crazy as well. Give me a good quality razor that I can clean by rinsing under a faucet and I will be happy. Goodbye Braun..."
2,Not what it's cracked up to be,"I bought this compulsively after reading all those hypes.Everyone is different, and this shaver does not work for me very well.1. It's not shaving as closely & cleanly as regular razor shavers.2. Sometimes this thing sucks up your hairs and pulls them off of your skin. It really hurts when that happens.Like I said, everyone's experience will be different because everyone has different facial shape and differet hair."
4,BRUAN SHAVER,"I have been a BRAUN loyalist for many years and the latest model has an improved motor, blades and design. The quiet blades provide a very close, comfortable shave and easy to hold and manuver around face and neck. The included electric cleaner system seems unnecessary, but will see if it extends the life of the blades. BRAUN is at the top of electic shavers for a close and comfortable shave."
3,Not what I expected,"I've used electric shavers for over 30 years and finally decided to spend the big bucks for the Braun after reading many favorable reviews here. After daily use for 2 months I have to say it's a bit dissapointing. I've used Norelco and/or Remington shavers for years and thought the Braun would be much better but alas, I've found this not to be true. I'm returning the Braun and going back to another Remington and spend half as much. As with all electrics, you can't expect to get the close shave of a blade but the Braun didn't out perform shavers at half the price."
3,ueker,"Three reasons it only gets 3 stars. 1: My foil wore out in 9 months, not the 18 months as promised. 2: My neck still seems a little rough. 3: The cost of the replacement cleaning units.It shaves as good as any other electric razor I've had, but I have some disappointments. I have a somewhat-rough beard, but for the money I would have hoped for a longer life from the foil."
4,Great Shaver,I love this shaver but it is not perfect. I would give it 5 stars but I don't think there is a perfect electric shaver. This is as close as you can get though. Well worth the money.
3,Braun 8985 360 shaver too complicated,"I found the Braun 8985 360 shaver to be a prime example of over development of what should be a relatively simple piece of equipment for a relatively simple task--shaving one's face and neck. The cleaning and charging stand with its tank of cleaning fluid is just not necessary. It calls too much attention to itself and unnecessarily complicates a simple task. I have found the Remington shaver with which I replaced the Braun to be a great shaver that can be used wet or dry, cleaned under running water. and charged with a simple connecting wire."
1,not working,"I had a similiar Braun for about 5 years prior to this purchase and it worked well.This one worked fine for about the first 2 weeks.After that, it would not charge or clean.I sent it in for repairs and the part that it needs has been on back order for about a month.They could not give any info as to when the part might be available.I hate paying 140+ for a razor I cannot use and in addition, paying shipping to have it repaired.Other than that, it was an excellent purchase."
2,Not the best razor I've had.,"My previous razor was a Panasonic linear model, which provided an excellent shave almost immediately. I really liked the idea of having a cleaning system, and Braun is known for its quality. The type of screen and cutting blades is very similar to my old razor, so I hoped the transition would be rapid and smooth (no pun intended!)So far, the quality of shaves have been underwhelming. I've followed instructions to the letter, and haven't been pleased with the results.So, I hesitate to recommend this razor to anyone seeking a close, smooth shave...you'll be disappointed. (The cleaning system works okay, and the blue lights on the razor and base look cool...but I shoulda stuck with the Panasonic brand!)"
3,Not great. Not worth the cost and extra supplies,"I am sending mine back. I have used Norelco shavers for some time, and have tried this one for 3 weeks now. I thought it would be a better shave given the hoopla and supposed technical advantages. It isn't. It still leaves uncut whiskers, and often gives me with a bloody nick - something I had never experienced from my fifty clam Norelco.The cleaning station is cool, but the noise and blinking lights freak out some members of the family. My razor doesn't want to come out of the cleaning station without some fuss; it sometimes starts the cycle again when I try to release it - meaning the razor is saturated in alcohol just before I want to shave."
2,mediocre uneven shave at best,"Cuts poorly. I have to shave over the same spot 3 or more times and that irritates my skin. DOES NOT get the tough to reach spots at all and WILL NOT cut my neck hairs no matter how many times i shave at any angle. The cleaner is nice but loud and the shaver is extremely loud. Not worth the price at all. Total let down.Also, the shaver cleaner is way over priced. It's just alcohol for gods sakes."
2,More $$$ gets you a closer shave??,"I purchased this shaver due to advertising report that it was the ""Best""I have a pretty heavy beard and after 1 month of using it, I feel that it is not any better than my 6 year old rotery head shaver....just costs much more!"
5,Could not be happier,"Recently my Braun 8585 electric shaver was stolen during a family trip. I needed to replace it and came across the 8985 model on Amazon. Very similar but this was the newer model so I expected at the very least, as good quality as the last model.It's been about a month and even though I had no complaints about the 8585 model, I am truly happy with this purchase. Both do have a slightly loud cleaning mechanism but since our bathroom is down the hall, it doesn't bother me. Does a great job overall and leaves my face smooth without irritating my skin.Pros:-Does a great job at getting to hair on my neck (under my jaw).-I've taken it on weekend trips a few times and the battery life has been better than expected.-Love that you can flip the switch and do a quick trim on my sideburns and then go back to finishing shaving.Cons:-Noisy cleaning may bother some who are sensitive to loud noises.Bottom line...worth the money!"
3,Slight ly Superior,"This shaver represents a slight improvement overall from the previous generation of Braun shaver. It's a bit more comfortable and quieter. However, my experience is that it doesn't shave quite as closely--I find my beard comes back quicker as the day proceeds than its predecessor.Tip: save on the cleaning liquid ripoff by cleaning head with brush and your breath before putting shaver into cleaning unit so the liquid lasts longer before getting too filthy to be effective."
4,Braun 8985 360 Complete Men's Shaver,"The Braun 8985 360 Complete Men's Shaver is very well designed offering an excellent shave and battery life. Contrary to the manufacturer's recommendation, it is not necessary to use the automatic cleaning system on a daily basis. Instead, I do so every 4-5 shaves; while, in between, I do a manual cleaning (brushing the head, etc.) after each use.If, however, my only option was to pay full retail price for the shaver - I would not have made the purchase. Amazon's price and prompt delivery made the purchase and excellent buy."
1,disappointed,"semi-decent shave above the chin, but along the jawline, chin and neck expect CUTS from having to shove the shaver into your skin but still no shaving of stray hairs or even whole patches of hair! too bad"
1,braun shaver,We ordered a shaver and received it missing a few parts. The unit worked twice but the third time would not accept a charge. We contacted the seller who has been very evasive about this transaction. We since disputed the charge with AMEX and are waiting for their instructions. We had asked for his address to ship it back and he refused. This was a horrible transaction.
5,amazon shopping,"I found this to be the easiest site to shop on. The prices cannot be beat. It is user friendly, and my packages arrived when they had said they would. I now look at this site first for anything that I need. Thank you."
3,somewhat dissatisfied,"Because of a shipment delay, it did not make it in time for Christmas. This item was ordered on 12/10/06."
3,Not For Me - but maybe others,"Tried this shaver after having rotaries in the past. Was drawn to the cleaning feature. After two weeks shaving was taking way too long, not very good and caused considerable irritation, particular on the neck. I don't have a thick beard, but hairs grow sideways and believe that was a problem for this type of razor. Stand was nice and workd well. Didn't find very easy to hold either, shape not good and too large. Purchased Norelco 9160XL and am happier with it os far."
3,Was hoping for the best,"shave ever for my husband, but he is disappointed that this shaver doesn't seem to shave as close as his old Wet/Dry Panasonic. He has only been using this new one for about two weeks, & hoped it would get better as he uses it, but the shave hasn't improved yet & he misses his wet/dry capability - so guess I picked the wrong gift. Thought since the Braun was rated so well in the reviews I'd read, that the Braun might be a good change for him, but my mistake... Apparently the Panasonic is better for him at a much lower price."
3,"I'm sorry, but I am not excited","Maybe I am doing something wrong, but I just don't like this shaver as much as everyone else. I have to go over the same spots so many times and press very hard against my skin to get rid of under-chin hairs. My skin is irritated after shaving, and the results are spotty as this shaver is unable to give me a clean shave. Also, if anything goes wrong, Braun service is slow and unhelpful. Overall, I think this shaver is overpriced and mediocre at best. The cleaning system is the best part."
1,had to return it,"I got this as a gift for my husband. He used it for about 3 weeks, but still had red marks, and had to follow up afterwards with a regular ""disposable"" razor. The whole process of shaving took twice as long as disposable razors and wasn't as good.Luckily, Braun had a 30 day money-back guarantee, so we were able to return it (minus shipping x 2)."
3,Satisfaction in the eyes of the Holder...,"Let's admit it, shaving is a very subjective topic. As electric shavers go, the Braun 360 Complete is pretty good--it's quiet, quick, maneuverable, shaves relatively cose (sometimes takes several go-overs), and self-cleaning (very cool). It's also expensive, but all electric razors are expensive when compared to old-fashioned hand-helds (and no electric razor has ever been able to give me as close a shave as a hand razor). It also irritates the skin of my upper neckline where I find it very difficult to get a close shave. Now I'll admit to having thick, fasting-growing, black-colored stubble, so it mught just be that electric razor technology is not yet up to my challenging standards!"
4,"Pretty Good, but could be a little better","This is my first electric razor so I don't have anything to compare it to. I decided to buy the Braun shaver b/c I was tired of shaving every other day or every third day with my Mach 3 and still having irritation.PROS:(1)The shaver does a good job of removing daily stubble.(2)Battery life is really good and the unit charges quickly.(3) Cleaning station leaves shaver feeling new, clean, and fresh.CONS:(1) I find myself passing over the same area too many times leading to minor skin irritation.(2) The trimmer feature is located at an awkward angle and seems like a design afterthought. (I don't use it for this reason)OVERALL:If this shaver were lost or stolen I would buy it again."
4,It serves it's purpose,"I have never used an electric razor before so I have nothing to compare. I have a very tough beard that grows fast. I often shave two times a day and this product does take it easier on my face then a regular razor blade. That is the reason I bought it. However, it takes me longer to shave in the morning since I have to go multiple times over my face to get a clean shave. I do not believe it is the product that is the cause, but rather my tough whiskers. It also does not get my neck area very well. If you do not have so rough of a face, this product will work really great."
4,First Braun Shaver,"Although I have had this shaver for only ten days, I am quite pleased with it. After using a rotary shaver for many years I wasn't sure of what to expect. For no more time in front of my mirror, I feel that I receive a much closer shave. The battery life seems to be excellent as I have yet to recharge since the initial charge."
2,Disappointed,"I bought this shaver for my husband. He has been using it for 8 months. I have started to look for another shaver since the shaver does not cut the hair close enough, especially on the neck. We thought that he just needs to get used to this type of shaver and it will get better. It did not."
4,This is a nice shaver,"Gives a great shave, and cleaning system is very convenient. It looks cool too.Slight negatives: (1) not the quietest way to shave your face; (2) cleaning mechanism creates a lot of noise--you'll need to get used to it or avoid it by vacating the room or just hopping in the shower after shaving; (3) cleaning fluid will easily spill out of the base if you're not careful with the base."
2,Closer shaves?,"I am not impressed with the closeness of the shaves, even after the recommended ""beard adjustment"" time. For the money, I expected better. Cleaning with the base is nice, but I wonder if it is just a gimmick to sell more product."
3,"Expensive, bulky, but works","bought this razor on recommendation of a shaver products store owner who was closing shop. It seems overpriced relative to other products I've used in the past and others that are on the market. I wanted a product with a long lifetime (previous shavers I've used with moderate frequency have lasted 2-3 years), and also with a clipper that could clip full beard including neck. The clipper head is too small to do this effectively. Perhaps the shaver will last a long time, but unless you're really into shaving, I'd buy a cheaper product."
5,I'd buy it again,"I've had this shaver for over 6 months. I still go ""Man, I'm glad I bought this razor"" everytime I shave.The only real criticism I can offer is that it takes me a bit to get the whiskers under my chin. The area is hard to get to with the razor and the hair grows different directions. But that's probably an issue with me, not the razor.Love it. Would buy it again."
3,a little over priced,"I bought it because out of all that I read it seemed to be the highest rated electric shaver on the market. It does a pretty decent job, it is the most comfortable electric shaver I've used but it doesn't get as close as I had expected. My old Panasonic produced a closer shave. Plus in order to keep it clean you need to spend $25 every few months on the cleaning solution which is pretty gimmicky, my old panasonic got just as clean with soap and water."
5,Simply the best!,"This is my 3rd Braun within the last 10 years. I have tried other brands, but they just don't measure up. The Braun gives me the closest and most comfortable shave ever. Also, the cleaning/recharging system works very well."
2,Beware:clean and renew base can be defective,"This Braun Shaver provides a close shave (except on lower neck), is constructed well with a good charging time, and is worth the money. Unfortunately the cleaning base is not. The cleaning base's metal contacts creep back into base and do not provide a secure charge! Even after taking base apart (which is risky, since the clean and renew base is constructed very flimsily and its' shoddy plastic components can easily break) the metal contacts will recede into base and you will not be able to charge or clean shaver without buying a new clean and renew base, which costs about sixty dollars. The shaver is excellent build quality, made in Germany, but the cleaning base was outsourced in Hungary and is very poor quality. I think Braun needs to really put more effort into constructing a quality clean and renew base for it's fine shaver. Otherwise, this shaver is definitely not worth its' expensive price tag."
4,Braun Series 5 Shaver,Been using for over a month now. Much closer shave than my old Norelco. Cleaning system takes some getting used to but appears to be of value. Battery life is excellent; used on vacation for 10 days and was still going strong. Docking station is a little bulky and has an irritating blue light.
2,Poor shave an irritating,"I just got the Pansonic Vortex es-la63-s and it is much better than this piece of crap. This thing is horrible, I shaved with it and it irritates my skin and doesn't give a close shave. I had bad skin for days and weeks and almost gave up the electric razor race."
4,Satisfied,"I am satisfied with this shaver. It is well made and engineered. I did have a ""break-in"" period when I started to use it--you may notice some pulling before your beard acclimates. It cuts as well as other electric shavers. I had a 5700 model before this. On that one, the shaver lasted about 4 years before the battery went bad, replaced the heads twice and the trimmer broke but was also using a blade sometimes.Time will tell if I paid too much although I got a very good price at Amazon after window shopping/comparing on the web."
4,"Works well, unreliable brand, expensive supplies","My husband has had several Braun razors.He continues to buy them because they cut his very tough beard well and cleaning and charging the razor is very convenient. However, previous models' cleaners have not lasted as long as they should, given the price of the razor. Also, the cleaning supplies are expensive. Unless this model is a big improvement on its predecessors this is NOT a cheap razor brand to buy or own."
4,Good but not great!,"It's been few months that I had used this shaver, so I guess the review would be useful and insightful.Pros:* Easy to clean. Just slot in and set the clean on and woo la la it's cleaned. No mess.* Useful hair trimmer.* The head can be fixed at 90 degree.* Saves time compared to wet razor shaving.Cons:* Leaves out few hairs here and there (Not a complete shave.).* When used at specific place in the face for a longer time, makes the skin harder."
4,Braun razor,"I have been using razor since Christmas. Shaves without burning, but not a very close shave.I still have to use hand razor to get a clean shave on neck."
2,Doesn't live up,"I would have to admit I was a bit dissatisfied about my purchase o. The shield and blades are suppose to last for 18 months but only after 4 months of everyday use the shield started to fall apart. I purchased the replacement blades and the replacements were of much higher quality than the ones that came with the model.I would say I like the self-cleaning function but with the 150 price tag I believe that the quality control should be much higher.I would not recommend this product, less expensive models would do the job just as well and with a 36 dollar price tag on replacement blades, after replacing them a couple of times you could buy a whole new razor."
1,Braun 8985 360 Complete,"Please do not believe the hype in this shaver. This is an expensive shaver which does not give you a close shave. I contacted Braun customer service, and all they did was to send me a foil and cutter which had the same problem of not giving me a clean shave. The only thing that works in this shaver is the cleaning system. Honestly, this is not a good buy for your bucks.."
1,Poor shaver,"I purchased this shaver 2 years ago and it's not very good. I don't have that much experience with electric shavers, but this one does not produce a close shave. It also leaves my skin red and irritated. The charging station itself doesn't really work either. I have to keep cleaning the connectors and jostling around the shave to get it to charge in the station."
3,Good but ...,"Pros: easy operation, cuts well.Cons: The liquid for cleaning just too fast and is already stating replace the foil."
2,Buyer Beware,"Sony has a great reputation, so I thought that when I shelled out tons of money for an MD player it would be worth it. And for a while, it was. It's a great looking model with excellent sound quality. It tends to eat batteries relatively quickly, but since it's rechargeable that's not too much of a problem. What *is* a problem is the quality. After owning mine just over a year, it began skipping frequently and often wouldn't eject first try. The remote also became quirky and would turn on for no reason and drain my batteries. Conveniently, all of these problems started happening soon after my warranty ran out. After about 18 months of use, it died. With no warranty, it was going to cost more to repair than to replace. This is my third experience with Sony CD/MD products, and my last. Each product broke conveniently after the warrantly expired."
4,They are unique,It really is this simple. They are a throwback to when music was fun and not so pre-packaged. It was a thrill to see them as it is a thrill to watch them again. What is more thrilling is listening to them and letting yourself go with them. No pretensions; just great music and a great time.
4,my freaken head!,"wow, what a bunch of NUTS! they are so druged up they can't even sing, but i did like it in some ODD way, some of the songs were good. boy they are whacky as hell!!! i don't know if you want this dvd or not, it's a toss up of freaky hippies and out of there minds weirdos!!!i don't know your quess is as good as mine."
4,Dr.Hook and the Medicine Show,"If you like early 1970's Dr.Hook and the Medicine Show and the theme of ""On the cover of the Rolling Stone"" you'll like this. I really enjoyed Ray Sawyer's triple Alabama yodel. It's a bunch of guys having fun and celebrating rock & roll. I just wish it was longer, but it's definitly worth buying and watching."
3,Norton's product is better,"I've been a 3M abrasives fan for a long time. I have to say though, comparing the two for sanding in a lacquer application. The 3M product loaded up and created shinny spots."
2,phew-sion,"Pat Martino is the only one who shines on Firedance by clearly distancing himself from emulating veena sounds ala McLaughlin and sticks to his post-bop lines. Unfortunately, most of the music falls into a cheesy phuzon experience thanks to Habib's Doordarshan inspired sitar playing. And Ilya is no Shankar, and it's heard here (or not) with his minimal interplay. OregonMusic of Another Present Era, GurtuUsfretor ShaktiHandful of Beautyany day for some adventurous interplay."
1,Does Not Work Well At All,Excitement to use my cell phone as an mp3 player turned to a disappointment rather quickly after using the ear piece. The volume is too weak with the ear piece.
3,Pure Confection,"Like good chocolate, this woman is smooth, rich, and rewarding to listen to late in the evening when you hunger for a tasty treat. Her voice is a pure rhythmic delight. If you dig sophisticated ladies doing tasteful renditions of superb songs, this lady is your ticket to paradise. I can't stop listening to this CD and I play it in my car when tooling around the beach communities in FL. Her rendition of Fine and Mellow, describes this CD perfectly! It makes living worthwhile to hear this kind of quality in a voice such as Miss Lee's. Buy it if you love the good life! Listen to Honeysuckle Rose and you'll lose your petals, believe me."
2,Ugly Vampire,"I did not like this movie. First of all, I think the vampire should be handsome and seducing and the actor interpreting him is uglier than anything. Besides, the ending does not make too much sense, even for a vampire movie."
2,superficial - not really informative,The book touches new features at a very superficial level. You would not really comprehend much out of it. Don't even think about wasting your money on this. You will get more info on oracle web site for free !
3,Tom Jones - The Antidote,"I have no taste for the vocal stylings of Tom Jones, so regarded this well-researched collection of his better-known antecedents as something of an antidote.It would seem that Tom's record collection favours soul balladeers and country music, especially from the sixties. Brook Benton, Chuck Jackson, Ben E King and Clyde McPhatter are among acknowledged influences that are included here. Naturally, Jerry Lee Lewis' version of Green Green Grass Of Home is here, and the Tom Jones stage favourite, Tupelo Mississippi Flash, Jerry Reed's tribute to Elvis Presley. Most of the Tom Jones versions were recorded between 1965 and 1973 but the final three tracks on this collection were covered on the 1999 album of duets Reload, including the forgotten gem A Lot Of Love by Homer Banks. The albums cheesiest moment occurs on David Houston and Tammy Wynette's My Elusive Dreams"
4,Excellent boat clock,"If you're looking for a solid, good looking boat cockpit clock, with the added bonus of an inclinometer, this is a great choice. It installs easily and the only drawback (advantage for some) is that it can be removed easily from the mounting plate to replace the battery or store safely below. For this price level a locking screw would have been a nice addition."
5,A fantastic masterpiece,"Arise Again O India - a truly wonderful piece of work by Francois Gautier. In a country essentially Hindu, where it is becoming increasingly fashionable to bash and abuse anything that is remotely Hindu, a true eye opener. Please note that it is not written by some so called Hindu fundamentalist but a French journalist. An honest effort towards correcting a million wrongs created by the British, the congress and the Communist-Marxist historians. If you thought the Indian history that you learnt was correct, check again. All those morons who still beleive in the Aryan invasion theory, DO NOT read this book. You will not be able to digest the amount of truth contained in the book. After all you can awake a person who is truly sleeping, not the one who doesn't want to wake up."
5,Hindus are in Coma and not in sleep.,Great Book. Would definitely rise those in sleep but surely not those is Coma (Hindus).
3,A good mystery...,"I just finished The Phantom Lady today, and I enjoyed it. The pace was just right; not too slow or too fast. It's one of those books that keeps you guessing up until the last few pages. I was very surprised by certain events, and I didn't see the major plot reveal coming until it hit me right in the face. I like that in a book, and if you are a fan of mysteries, I think you will enjoy this one!"
1,Not a SCJD study guide,"The book title is misleading. I needed a SCJD study guide. The book is primarily the SCJP (310-035) study guide occupying 555 out of 750 pages. The SCJD section is nothing but a listing of questions for you to think about. While the questions may be useful, they by no means warrant the ""Developer"" portion of the title. If you are looking for a real SCJD study guide, get yourself a copy of ""The Sun Certified Java Developer Exam with J2SE 1.4"" by Mehran Habibi, et al, instead. It has a real example that is developed throughout the book."
3,Practice tests misleading,"I found the practice questions and mock exams available both in the book and online to be somewhat misleading. In particular the practice questions which require you to interpret the behavior of a block of code were downright simplistic compared with those on the actual test. The code in the practice questions would throw a curve ball at you, but when I got to the actual test I found those questions throwing 3 or 4 at once.Consider this book an adequate piece of your test preparations. It's definitely not a one-stop solution."
1,The Worst Computer Book I Have Ever Started Reading,"The title is not an exaggeration. The other reviews are correct. The book is loaded with errors. Not just typos, but substantive errors that show the author has a substandard understanding of the java language. I wrote the author (his email is not made available in the book, which is a red flag, but I was able to find it by other means) and he ignored me.I took the book back for a refund. I suggest Brogden's exam cram which is less expensive anyway."
1,This book is inapropriate for the exam,"This book is so full of errors and meaningless points, that it merely confuses the reader instead of help him prepare for the exam. It doesn't even cover all topics in the exam. For example, I/O acces is not discussed at all. The self-testing application attached on a cd is buggy, and contains the same questions as the book does. I would recommend ""Complete java 2 certification guide"", published by Sybex instead. It stands tall where this book falls through, and most important, it covers _ALL_ the topics that are on the exam(310-025). Don't buy this book, it's a waste of money, don't read it, it's a waste of time."
5,Everything you need to know,"High-level, in-depth yet down-to-earth. This book is great! Straight-forward and conceptually sound, one of the most well-written certification guides I've ever read. Lots of facts, no fluff. Focuses in on key topic areas. Sample questions solidify understanding and build confidence."
4,"Good, complete guide","I just passed the SCJP exam with 95%, and this was the book I used. The book does a good job of covering the essentials you need to know for the exam. Certainly, no topic is missing, the practice questions are right on, and the summaries are good. The only reason I can't give it five stars is that it could have had a bit more depth; this is perhaps the difference between getting 85% and 95% on the exam. However, with this book and a Java compiler I was able to answer all of my questions and score quite highly.Additionally, the LearnKey practice exam provided with the book is a good indicator of how you'll do on the exam, I scored the same on both the practice exam and the real thing, and even missed the same types of questions (threads and collections.)For what it's worth, JavaRanch.com is a good source of information, and the Whizlab mock exams are great, they make you think carefully about the Java language.Good luck."
1,UNACCEPTABLE number of errors!,"I don't know how some people admit to the many errors in this book but still give it a good rating! My brain can't learn programming from a book I don't trust.Two pieces of code in the first two chapters glared at me with code that looked flawed. I wrote and attempted to compile both, to find out to my surprise that I was right, the code didn't compile (yes, the book said it should)! The second such snippet was test chapter 2, question 14, and the answer I gave was the code would not compile. They said it would. Such errors are simply not acceptable for a book like this.When I look at allegedly valid code in a book and think it won't compile, I want to be wrong everytime. That's how I learn when I'm wrong. That's what these books are for...."
1,Poorest prepared book I've ever seen,"This book's greatest asset is its errors. They are so pervasive that the reader quickly learns not to accept anything read in the book and to go to the compiler to verify everything. This helps one become very well versed in the Java 2 language, but it quickly becomes tedious and frustrating. It leaves me wondering if Syngress/Osborne is at all familiar with the concept of proofreading.It was well conceived but very poorly done. I strongly suggest that your money would be better spent on ANY other book for Sun Certified Java Programmer preparation."
4,Not for the people who didn't know Java Before,"it goes right into the essential of the Java code, if you don't know Java before, you should read some other books first."
5,"""THE BEST BOOK"" for JAVA 1.4 Exam","If u are a total novice to java, read EVERY PAGE of this book, do ALL the excercises, tests and be assured of scoring atleast 85% in the 1.4 version exam.This book + 2 Exams in exam cram's SCJP book = My score 95 %Thanks Kathy !!!"
4,Accomplishes What It's Meant To,"Before I bought this book I read all the reviews with interest. I ended up buying it, and am glad I did. As some have pointed out, there are some errors in the book, but it didn't seem pervasive to me. I also found corrections on the Publishers web site. The book is on target with the necessary info. you need to pass the exam- the information on Anonymous Inner Classes was especially helpful. All in all, I'm glad I used this book as my primary study tool (that with experience!)"
5,An Excellent Book... Very Well Written!,This is an excellent book and probably one of the best ever written on Java certification. The software included with this book is particularly helpful to all of you interested in Sun/ Java 2 certification
5,"It does the job, well.","I had ONE goal - to pass the certification exam. I had ONE book to study from - this book. And it did the job. It covered all the objectives for the exam. The questions at the end of chapters are a good shakedown to highlight your weaknesses.If you can notice each and every little typo, that's a compliment to the book, it has prepared you well enough to notice the right from wrong. All you need to pass this exam is: this book + mock exams (beyond what's available on the CD)."
3,Good but missing major pieces,"Having just taken the exam, I found that there was a major topic missing out of this book. I/O is not covered at all and it composed at least 2 questions on the exam. Also, I answered questions on Garbage Collection with answers strait out of the book and got none right. I even went back and checked the book again after the test. Also in the book, the chapter on Inner Classes is missing an entires set of sample code.Beyond these problems, the book was organized fairly well but the errors are can be a killer at test time. I would suggest a supplemental book to go along with this one."
3,Not any better than Sybex Complete Java 2 Certification,Have you guys out there caught this error? Page 260-chapter 8-Inner Classes:EnclosingClass ec = new EnclosingClass(); EnclosingClass.MemberClass mc = ec.new EnclosingClass.MemberClass();These lines of code will give you a 3 compile errors.Correct way: EnclosingClass ec = new EnclosingClass(); EnclosingClass.MemberClass mc = ec.new MemberClass();It does not cover Java I/O which definitely will be asked on the exam. Man! Technical books these days are so full of typos and syntax errors. I wasted my money again for the third time for java 2 certification books.
5,Best book out there for Java certification,"I prepared with this book and scored 91% on Sun Certified Java Programmer exam. Study this book well, do the mock exam on the CDROM and the bonus exam you get to download by registering at their website and some good sample exams on javaranch.com, and you should be able to pass the certification without a problem. I was surprised to see the problems presented in the actual test resemble closely to the problems in this book in terms of wording and difficulty. One more thing about this book: very enjoyable to read (lots of humour). Definitely, worth buying."
5,Good choice,"This was a good choice for preparing for the exam. I read it fully. Very extensive, covering all exam topics. Although, if you plan to take the designer exam as well, you might find some other books that will prepare you for both the programmer and designer exams."
1,I passed in spite of this book.,"This book is awful. The sample questions contain tons of errors. The included software is detrimental to your success. This book doesn't even contain a section on File I/O which is on the test. The section on threads may be the worst explanation of threads I've ever seen.I ended up studying in a bookstore with their copy of the Sybex Java Cert. book, while it contained errors as well, it seems that the authors actually know something about the test.To be fair the section on Garbage Collection is great. It contains one of the best explanations of weak references and phantom references that I've seen. The only problem is that these topics are not covered by the test."
2,"Detailed, but full of errors. Doesn't cover IO.","This book is filled with errors, making it extremely frustrating to use. To make things worse, there is no accompanying web site which lists known errors. The cd that comes with the book merely contains questions in the book, and has several bugs and wrong answers. The book doesn't cover I/O, which is covered on the exam. Also, too much material that won't be tested is presented, making it a long and tedious book to read from cover to cover.On the plus side, this book is detailed and covers some topics well. There are about 20 questions at the end of each chapter, which help you develop your understanding of the material.I have also used ExamCram, by Bill Brogeden, and have found it to be much better. It is very efficient, with few errors, and has a web site that lists the known errors. It also has many excellent questions.Bottom line: Don't get this book!"
5,good points,"recommended for a hardcore programmer, and this book offers excellent customer service support, and is very thorough for the most past, of all of the Java 2 books on the market, this tops."
3,Some unclear points.,"In all fairness, it did a great job guiding me towards passing the exam. But there were many times when I had to actually write a small block of Java code to clarify a given topic that was somewhat unclear. A couple of the test questions/answers at the end of each chapter were wrong. Who proofread this book?"
4,A number of small problems,"Hi;I think the authors did a very good job writing this. However, the editor must have been asleep. There are a number of little bugs and omissions in the book. And a big one in the enclosed CD test.That said, I read this book and then took the test and got an 87% - but I have been programming for a long time.- dave"
5,an excellent book,Last year I have no occupation in computers but very little knowlege of program Java. This book I use to prepare for exam and receive with it good mark. I now have job in computers and it is this book that thank from me. This book has everything to do good on exam.
2,Beware this book!,"This book is ok for the old SCJP exam which was based on J2SE 1.4. But the new exam is based on J2SE 5.0, and this book does NOT cover that. The book by Phil Heller does."
2,poor book in more ways than one,"I don't understand why this book got so many good reviews. It is poor in moreways than one:- poor and incomplete explanation of Java language features- contradictory statements- ambiguous use of English language- gradual exposure of the reader to Java features, through statements that are only half true- summary sections (two minute drills) that are too longThe only thing good in this book, are the ""self test"" sections at the end of each chapter. And the ""mockup exam"" included on the CD. The instructions to get a second exam via the internet, were not correct.Correcting all the flaws and errors in this book, actually did help me dig into the Java language. The books I turned to, to see how things really worked, are:Java Precisely, by Peter SestoftEffective Java, by BlochThe Java Programming Language, by Arnold, Gosling, HolmesJava In A Nutshell, by David FlanaganBy the way, I did pass the exam the first time (and mostly thank Peter Sestoft's book for it)."
1,"Passed Exam, but this book is full of errors.","I took the cert exam today and passed so, the book was usefull enough in that respect. However, this book has so many errors that it may mislead and cause actual exam questions to be missed. Also, note your edition, as the first edition is missing a section on java.io! This IS tested for the cert exam. Also, be sure to download the error page from the Syngress website, even then be carefull as there are still plenty of others! Good luck."
1,This book is a joke,"There are many good Java certification books available. This is not one of them. The text is lame compared to ""Exam Cram"" or ""Passport Java 2."" The CDROM test is worthless. It contains so many errors that I doubt it was ever proof read."
2,Disappointing,"Initially I was impressed with the book,... it was easy to understand and had good examples.... and this made me look over the fact that their website was misspelled on the ""About the contributors page"" and that Assignments was spelled incorrectly on the back inside cover. (As a title to a section!)Then I realized that the book is missing IO and has many mistakes within some example questions! This made studying for a test difficult. I was lucky to have two friends to study with who each had different books."
2,Lame Book; Much better ones available,I have used three books. Both of the others (Exam Cram and Roberts book) are better. There are lots of errors in this book. Not just typos. And there is no errata listed. And neither the technical editor or one of the authors responded to me when I e-mailed to ask about it. And the practice questions that it referes to are just the chapter questions again.
2,Do not depend only on this book,"Generally, the authors did a good job.However,many methods and interfaces that are being tested on the exam are not mentioned in this book. DO NOT TRUST the chapters written by Trent Heintz."
1,Don't buy this book,"Contrary to what some people are saying here, it does have a section on File I/O, but I agree that the mock exam is NOT useable.The code isn't indented, making it almost impossible to read. The Review mode of the exam (where the answers should normally be given) doesn't work at all and although they offer a fix (for what?) on their web site it doesn't work.If you need mock exams get jq+ and check out javaranch.com. The book itself seems to be ok, but I am less than impressed and regret this purchase."
5,An excellent book!,"This is the only book you need to study to take the exam (of course, besides doing some mock exams) IMHO. I studied it for 4 weeks and completed some online mock exams and passed with a surprisingly good score of 88%. The material is very easy to follow and straight to the point. Highly recommended"
5,A Great Exam Study Guide,"This book is very detailed and to-the-point on what we should expect to be on the exam. The ""exam-watch""es are particularly helpful. There are some errores in the book but nothing serious. I learned a lot about Java from this book. Considering that I have not written any serious Java programs before, this book definitely helps me to achieve the 90% I got in the exam"
1,Not a thorough job,"Contains many misleading examples and supporting explannations too! I do not care how other examples are -- there can not simply be misleading examples! This book may be read by unsuspecting beginners.One misleading example is in page 112, class Equals(Topic java.lang.Object). The program output is timing sensitive and thus not predictable.Answers to chapter 2, example 14, 18 are wrong.The list goes on.I am dissatisfied and I would not recommend this book to anyone."
1,"cute, fluffy, worthless","The cover is beautiful. The examples are cute, including ""Madame Cthulu's Tarot Cards"". The inside of the cover had some great Java tips. However, as a certification guide, it is completely unacceptable. Their self-tests are peppered with incorrect answers and I was unable to find any means to get official errata for the book. I strongly suspect that whoever put the thing together knew it was a hack job and that it is designed to sell well only, not to help anyone pass a certification. There is simply no ethical justification for not publishing errata. It is overpriced and you don't even get what you pay for."
1,Definitely Not For Certification,"The number of errors is great enough to make one doubt about the integrity of the book. How could the errors go unnoticed? It is a pity that such books get off the press and claim to be helping people to pass certification exams.Anyone who is sharp enough would spot the numerous errors. I seriously doubt anyone who says the book is useful really knows what Java is about. The book confuses with its numerous errors rather than teaches.If you want to prepare for the certification exam, get a better book. Consider the one from Sybex, ""The Complete Java 2 Certification Study Guide"" or another book, ""A Programmer's Guide to Java Certification"". These are better organised and worth your dollars and cents."
4,Excellent book if somewhat new to Java,"I wanted to get certified but wasn't sure how to go about preparing for the exam. When I saw this book in the bookstore I really got exceited. It was exactly what I needed. After the first few chapters I noticed a few errors, so I went to the website and sure enough there was an errata sheet. I corrected the errors and then flew through the rest of the book. It seems like it was really written for someone who has been working with Java for under 2 years or so, which was perfect for me. It explains things carefully, as opposed to Core Java 2 which I found really difficult to read through.Bottom line: I passed the test with a high mark. This was the only book I needed. Without the errata sheet this is a 3 star book, with all errors corrected it is a 5 star book, so I'll give it 4 stars."
5,Do not get any other book!!!,"I was studying for this test for months and things were not moving that fast with the other book I had. The material was dry and the book was very unorganized. I came on Amazon and read the reviews on this one and saw that people liked it and decided that I would get it 2 weeks before the test. Well I started from scratch again, granted I am a full time Java programmer and I get to practice what I learn; but I have to give most of the credit to the authors of this book for the good score that I got.Thank you!!!"
4,Worked for me!,"I started with the first Stanek edition which had too many errors and weak treatment of some important subjects. I found this book at a Java conference. I found it to be well organized, well written and learned a lot from it. There were a few errors and some an annoying inconsistency in the discussion of threads but nothing of any significant consequence -- I passed the exam easily on the first try. One of the things I like most was that the more challenging self test questions were more difficult than those I had encountered on the exam. Most of the questions in the self tests were very close to what I saw in the exam. The part I like least was the CD. It had most of the same questions as the book. After the first two chapters I gave up the CD and went back plain old pencil and paper. The reason I gave it four stars is that the book isn't perfect and I didn't really benefit from the CD."
2,The bad and the good,"This book definitely deserves a lot of the criticism levied against it for typos, mistakes, and inaccuracies. I had to constantly refer to the Java APIs for clarification. For example, to get the runtime environment, use Runtime.getRuntime() and not Runtime.getInstance() as specified on page 232 ""on the job"".Further, if you've already bought this book, you may want to find another reference for Java IO. This is the last chapter of the book and seems to be almost an after thought with a very poor flow.The Exam Simulator is unforgivable flawed with several incorrect answers :-O.On the positive side, I did like the authors writing style and other then IO, the author gives a fairly good treatment of the topics. This is the only book I used to study for the exam and I scored rather well.So, if the Author/Publisher had simply proof read this book, it would be a GREAT book instead of a FAIR/POOR not-worth-the money book."
2,Incomplete && full of errors,"Book thisBook = new Book(""Sun Certification Programmer for Java 2 Study Guide""); int errors = thisBook.getErrors(); /* returns too many errors */ Chapter iOChapter = thisBook.getJavaIOPackage(); /* returns null */The book and test are full of errors. The java.io package is not even mentioned (but is tested heavily in the exam). Sample questions are not similar to those on the exam. Sample questions are not even in the same format as the exam questions (don't hold this against them b/c the book was printed before the exam October change).To end on a (somewhat) positive note, this book is a good beginning. Start with it and then get another book when you want to pass the exam."
2,Sun Certified Programmer for Java 2 Review,"This book is absolutely chock full of outrageous errors on very basic aspects of java. The editing is pretty poor, also. While it may provide some help in passing the certification exam, some of the errors are dangerously misleading. I cannot recommend this title."
5,"Dear Authors, please write more books like this!","Just got my 90% at SCJP exam, and I am indebted to this book. The authors managed to clearly (and with a wonderful sense of humor) explain everything, but especially those topics which were the most complicated on the exam. I managed to get 100% for threads, after all! I'd wish to buy more books written by these authors. May be about Web Services certification?"
3,The WORST adaptation of a movie ...,I was very excited when they announced that there was a game for one of my favorite movies. But that excitement ended very fast when I began to play it. The graphics were THE WORST I have never seen before. Rick O' Connell looks like somebody hit him with a pan. Very bad. And the game... a Frustrating experience. It's SO bad I sold it as a trade in and I guess I won.
4,An almost perfect game,This game has won my heart for being one of my favorite action game.The graphics are so-so.The sound is greal.The controlls are so-so as well.The game plays very good.It does still not top my favorite NightMare Creatures 2.
3,This mummies okay with it.,My 9 year old son and husband enjoy this game. Graphics are not very good.We don't think they sound like the real characters either but we find it humorous. We all like the music. You don't have a choice of characters to play with. The game is not real challenging.We liked both movies so they just have fun with the combination of music and levels they are playing on along with some imagination. We rented this game and are now purchasing it. We can think of better ways to improve the game but for now they are just having fun with it.
1,...................,"both of the movies were great, but this game is pathetic! i had a sleepover with my friends and my mom went out and rented 2 games we wanted ready to rumble boxing and some other game but they didn't have it so she got the mummy. so i was thinking cool maybe it will be as good as the movie. i was wrong after the first 5 minutes or so me and my friends were both bored and frustrated. DONT GET IT DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY!"
3,(Clever Mummy Joke Here),"This game is fun if you like straightfrward simple games. If you're looking for a challenge, look elsewhere. If you liked the movie, this may provide limited enjoyment, but the sloppy controls and lack of replay value should bore away any serious gamers."
3,"Good, but examples are too easy.","I own several of Ellie's books and have taken classes from her in Silicon Valley. The books are clear, the index is excellent, but the examples are too simple. For example, many examples use input typed in from the keyboard (instead of reading in input from a file). Business applications/corporate applications usually read in input from a file."
4,"Good reference book, but...","This is really a good text book for beginners and reference book for regular users. You can learn 3 major shells in one book by lots of examples and lab exercirses. And find useful utilities quickly from the back of the book. But something are not so good about this book : 1. too many typos, wrong scripts, and results 2. some contexts should not appear over and over again (e.g., the ""vendor"") 3. some examples and lab exercises are used in all 3 shells, which are good for the beginners to learn the usages between difference shells. but they are not really very big differences between them."
1,Too many errors. A nice effort but not proofed well enough.,"While this book is unique in its attempt to comprehensively cover all three shells, Awk, Sed, and Grep, the many errors don't leave one with confidence in what one reads. If one can get past the syntax errors, the book may be worthwhile. e.g. !#/bin/csh -f should read #!/bin/csh -f . Back quotes and single quotes should match in C programing but do not in the examples shown in this text."
3,"Good author, bad publisher.",I was able to write a Bourne shell script to trim logs armed with only this book and a computer. The examples were helpful. The index was not. The typography is especially bad. It seems that the Bourne shell is very picky about spaces. The book is set with fonts which make spaces hard to spot.
5,"Three shells plus grep, sed and awk in one place!","This books is great--the three most popular shells, and the regular expression manipulation tools as well, all in one place.I've recently changed from using csh to using ksh, and finding examples of how the syntax is handled in the new shell has been invaluable. My boss now thinks I'm a shell programming wizard!The best thing about this book is that it is compiled from the author's coursework. These examples have all been tried in classes through the UC Extension, and they're designed to teach students at various levels of expertise. I've been a unix system administrator for several years now and I use this book on a regular basis. I recommended this book to a novice sys admin who had never written a script before, and he was able to get started quickly using this as a reference. Some books just seem to make your job easier. This is definitely one for me."
2,Frustrating to find what you're looking for.,"The index is way out of sync with the actual pages. Just try finding the rm command on page 620 as the index says it's located. In fact, all the UNIX commands I was looking for were not on the page they were said to be by the index. It is very frustrating trying to find an example for something you want to do when the index sends you on a wild goose chase. The examples I was able to track down were very helpful, but finding them was quite a chore. I wish I could get my money back from this book. I waste more time trying to find the right example than the time saved by writing the script is worth. It would be faster to do it by hand. Ellie would do well to find another editor/publisher."
3,Good in combination with my Spanish classes,"I am enjoying the Destinos tapes in combination with my on-going Spanish classes. Because I have very little time to study outside of my classes, I have found that listening to the the tapes while driving helps my comprehension and furthers the ""immersion"" process. I am able to pick up the cadence of the language and each time I listen to the tapes I comprehend more and more."
1,Not Faust's Final Version,"Jacob Faust had a tumultuous back and forth w/ the filmmakers of this film. He had abandoned the project when he knew it wasn't going to fulfill his vision. He never provided the ending of his script to the Leiser brothers. You can tell. Jake felt this was not going in the direction he wanted and gave up on it.Leisers sold this on that premise and trys to pretend they will ""donate"" the money to his family currently seeking justice for wrongful death. They capitalized on Jake's untimely killing to promote other film endeavors."
1,"worst ""movie"" I ever saw","This is a silly, high-school-level comedy that is dishonestly advertised as something serious instead. Much of the time you will see the corny actor just walking about. Maybe in a field, maybe among trees, maybe drinking beer, etc. He reads his lines like the guy who stands up to read whatever the teacher tells him to read and doesn't care at all about doing it. The audience is expected to be duped into believing the nonsense is deep and artistic by the use of angle-shots and people sitting on benches wearing masks and disconnected scenes that have no thread of continuity and other transparent such. I've seen a lot of movies but this is the worst I've ever seen. I actually fast-forwarded it to see if there was any interesting action ahead. I never had the desire to do such a thing before. What an amateurish effort."
1,Too old,My son seems to enjoy it some what but I am into computer graphics and this is horrible the game play sucks can't even see the mega sword when fighting monsters poorly developed game not worth $1.00 I am sorry i bought it
5,Power Rangers Lightspeed Rescue Fun!,"I ordered the Power Rangers Lightspeed Rescue game for my old Nintendo 64 game console. I have all of the old game consoles, minus Sega Genesis, and I wanted my son to see how fun games were when I was a kid. He loves it and I've made an old school gamer out of him, starting with the original Nintendo console and my beloved Super Mario Bros.! The game came via USPS very quickly and in the condition in which the seller described, which was in great condition considering it had no box or directions. Thank you for providing such a wide variety of games for me and I will be sure to order more games from AREALBUSYMAN in the future!"
3,Preaty boring.,"This game is not worth to buy beacause the game is preaty easy,long game and boring but megazord fighting is fun. If this game did not have megzord fightig I would have this game 2 stars. Do not buy this game."
2,Would be great if it had better hardware,This was purchased as a Christmas gift for my parents to store their DVD's. The cabinet was full as shown in the picture. It was great until 6 months later when the hinges started to deform causing the doors to sag. Now when you open the doors they drag along the base and scuff the finish. Larger hinges are needed to carry the weight of a full door of DVD's.
1,Couldn't get into it,Maybe it's the fact that I'm not accustomed to the humor of leachy fellows or that I need to have a book with a plot but I just couldn't get into this book.I stoped after the chapter Sonny Boy. I couldn't draw anything from the book that would let me go any further. It just wasn't intresting.Where in blazes did this Bingo character come from? What happened to Stanley?This is my first WOdehouse book I picked it up because I liked the title. Well don't judge a book by that.Did I enter into the middle of a series?
4,Decent Selection,"Okay, are you ready? The 5 music videos on this DVD are:1. ""Rock You Like A Hurricane""2. ""Rhythm of Love""3. ""Believe in Love""4. ""Still Loving You""5. ""No One Like You""I emailed one of the sellers to ask. However, I am still waiting for the correct DVD to be sent as I was mistakenly sent Boyz II Men. The turnaround time is supposedly 2-4 weeks. Unacceptable, but that has nothing to do with the content of the DVD! I would have liked more videos, but for the price? Unbeatable! If you want a complete package, purchase A Savage Crazy World!"

It will cost more though!!"
4,Buy this cd,"Hal Swift has a voice extremely similar to Rich Mullins. With lyrics almost as potent and music that is perfectly suited to each song. If you get this cd, you'll end up memorizing every word and trying sing along with his very hard to reach vocals. I will never understand how so many untalented people get played on the radio, while incredible musicians such as this man sit at home looking for work. Help him and yourself, buy it."
2,Not as good as Blood Brothers,"I would recommend this, if you are looking f/ a great history of the Menendez family. As in the Court details, this is a little sketchy.Grab, the Blood Brothers w/it. It has a great detail on the court transcripts (at times you may feel like your reading a script)."
3,Dilutes both practices- tai chi & yoga,"I like Scott and have many of his DVDs. He is relaxed with a great voice to walk you through his programs. I saw previews of this DVD so I'm surprised I'm a bit disappointed. The moves are fluid, creating flexibility and strength but it seemed long. The table position is tough. Usually I go through routines I like and the time flies. The bonus programs are very interesting and present different things to try. Don't forget to listen to the interviews of everyone he uses in the video - definitely a pleasant addition. I can't put my finger on it more specifically but this was my 1st go through. I will certainly try it a few more times and update my review."
3,Maybe need to know more,"I do a lot of aerobic exercise but not enough stretching. Thought this might be simple enough, but I am not far enough along to do all of it. I do like the tempo but the floor segment for the leg/back stretches is too hard on my knees."
2,Um....,"I really dont know what to think about this movie. I honestly wish I had rented this or saw it before I bought it because this was not one of my favorite purchases. I probably would not have bought it if I saw it first. It's not the type of movie you want to watch over and over. It was okay but REALLY slow. It's your classic quirky boy loves popular girl from the other side of town, he tries to get her to see life in a different light but in a very unorthodox way. Girl starts spending time with boy and realizes she is not only changin but falling for him but is afraid of her status changing but losing herself so she holds back. She finally gives in and lets him love her and then he acts like an idiot. It took forever to realize that Keith was going through some issues and it was infuriating. He finally came to his senses but I was kind of over it at that point. All in all it was okay but again not my favorite."
1,>:(,This whole movie STUNK! I'd save my time and not watch it if I were to do it again. Basically Keith is a complete jerk who messes this girls life up
2,Wasn't very good.,"Thanks Mr.5 star reviewer (you know who you are), you made it sound like this would be the last movie you ever saw. The only mind blowing thing about this film is that the girl main actor is freaking OLD."
2,"I didn't hate it, but I didn't like it.","Based on the high marks from many reviewers, I had a huge expectation from the this movie. It didn't even come close after having watched it. The guy is weird and it has several weird twists.Another movie, A Walk To Remember, has closer theme as of this movie, but is so much REAL and better."
5,Great Teenage movie,"Everytime I get the chance, I always watch this movie. It's one of my favorites (The notebook, a walk to remember are my other ones) Great for teenagers :)"
4,Product issue,"I love the movie Keith. It is about growing up and learning about what is important in life in a very materialistic and shallow world. However, for some odd reason the copy amazon sells here is edited. There are a couple scenes and portions removed from the movie on the amazon DVD. Thus the 4 star review."
1,depressing!!,"I watched this movie with my friend Libby. We thought it would be a cute movie because it has Jesse McCartney in it. However, it is extremely confusing, and even more depressing! The story line was incredibly hard to follow, and we never really figured out what happened. It was just weird and depressing. DO NOT WATCH unless you want to be tormented, thinking about this movie, for days!Feel free to comment!"
1,Don't waste your time or money!,"When you consider that quality film like Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist is now available on DVD, why would anyone waste their time on this movie....it features mainly washed up older actors and a few new-comers...all of whom are probably here mostly for a paycheck. Check it out on Rotten Tomatoes...and then compare it to Nick and Norah! Take my word for it!"
4,Enjoy it for what it is,"I happened across this movie in a search, and it was comparing it to ""A Walk to Remember."" Well, if you want to watch that movie, then watch it. If you want to see a movie that deals with this character, Keith and his trials, then this is the movie for you. Yes, there are some similarities, however, this was very well done. Some parts seemed unreal, and I couldn't quite get a handle on the big reveal about what was up with Keith. I would however suggest this movie to friends, as it was better than some of the junk that has been on at the MEGAPLEX lately."
1,Weird and improbable,"Keith is strange. He sets out to destroy the life of a popular bystander at his high school without cause. I understand and can relate to the message of "" opposites attract"" but it is so hopeless for them that their eventual relationship makes no sense. Keith was creepy ( acted to perfection, however) which was a turn off from the opening credits."
5,Great Buy,"i saw this movie and I just had to buy it. You kind of know whats going to happen next in the movie, but its one of those movies where it does not matter. It was shipped very quickly and it came in the condition it said it would. No problems what so ever."
4,great movie,"I think is a very deep movie,it's a powerful movie. I highly recommend it. It brings memories of teen times and also makes you think about the real importance of many things around us, it helps you to stop and analyze a bit the true meaning of everything in life. It A MOVIE not just a movie, and a well realized one."
4,Al ost excellent,I really like this movie but was left wanting. I guess I needed better closure. One two three four fiveeeeeee
4,Fantastic!,"Watched this movie before I bought it, and it was fabulous. I bought the DVD online, since you couldnt find it in stores. I love it! The only problem I have with it though, is the movie I watched before hand and the movie I got from Amazon were different, there were some scenes cut out. But otherwise, great movie, great purchase."
2,Track 10. . .,". . .is by far the best song on this CD. In fact, if I could have bought the single track (MP3) for .99, I would have. I have bought whole CDs for one song in the past but this one was by far the worst. I love Roy Ayres, but his one sounds like he tried to hard to make it work. . . and it didn't.BTW, track 13 is serviceable."
1,not scary,"If you are into experimental hodgepodges, then you'll like this. If not, you won't. Not really horror at all, if that's what you're looking for."
3,"Online Help in a Book: THAT'S ALL, REALLY","If you go to the online help for Visual Studio and select the VID view, you get the same info that's in this book. That's not all bad. I like the linear presentation and organization real-view of the book. I purchased Amundsen's _Using VID 6_ as a first book and missed the useful catalogue type listing of ALL objects, methods and properties. In the help files you have the hotlinks, that's about the only difference. Be forewarned, even with a User's Manual & Programmer's Ref, VID does not give sufficient examples for the novice or even an intermediate programmer. Pretty big intuitive leaps are needed to arrive at what seems a simple logical step. The VID Web Ref helps by providing a linear view of multi-dimensional hypervolume."
5,Excellent reference. Not a coffee table book. :-),"This is the best single reference on Web technologies I have ever held in my hand. If you want a physical copy of all the methods, properties, objects and statements of JScript, VBScript and ADO, along with an enormous collection of HTML entities and Cascading Style Sheet attributes, buy this book right now.This is a heavy-duty reference. It is not for people who are just learning how to use VBScript or JScript.I don't know why the summary (and one of the other reviews) says the book is 500-600 pages. This reference is 1574 pages thick, and the VBScript section alone is over 200 pages. As an ASP developer, this is by far the best paper product investment I have ever made -- it has replaced a total of 5 other books on my bookshelf, and has probably prevented me from buying a few others. Now I've got room for pictures of my family! :-)"
3,Not just for VID users! But has two serious flaws,"You've probably read everyone's glowing reviews, so I'll get to the point. Although I found the book EXTREMELY useful (I use it so much, the pages are coming apart), but it has two serious flaws:#1: The book lacks any serious examples. It leaves the novice reader (and sometimes the near-expert) guessing. Why not a CD full of examples?#2: There is NO INDEX! Who writes a book nowadays and doesn't include some form to find information other than the TOC?Outside of these two problems, this is a higly effective book and its not just for InterDev users. The information provided will help anyone using JScript, VBScript, DHTML, and CSS."
4,Beautiful Book...Great Ideas,"I am re-doing a bedroom and wanted ideas for doing it in a ""cottage style"".The book has wonderful pictures that give you ideas for every room in the house."
4,surprising quality,"I saw this product for the first time during a visit to a friend.Il was the original hard cover of ""The Practical Encyclopedia of Calligraphy"" and looking through it I fell in love at first sight.So I decided as usual to check Amazon.com for the various possibilities they offer.I made my choice and ordered.The book, I ordered this time from an ""used"" item, which arrived not only earlier than announced, but was also in an astonishing good shape."
4,Good fill in the gaps for PHP Programmers,"If your a newbie coder I would try to find something else to start on. If your an all around code everything depending on the job kinda programmer this is a great book for you to help supplement your current php knowledge. I have been coding php, perl, c and shell for over a decade and found myself a little lacking in an in depth look a php. I finally found a book that doesn't spend most of it's time explaining simple crap and does not assume you know the obscure stuff as well. The book does a good job at sectioning out the structure of php scripting and describing most of the functionality of functions and shows you how to code inline and OOP."
3,Typographical errors abound,"I have never seen a book with so many typographical errors, including errors in code. There is supposedly an errata page, but there is nothing on that page except sponsored links.--Kenoli"
5,"""Essentials"" Lives On!","I have been teaching people computers for over 15 years, so I have seen a quite number of manuals and ""how-to"" books. I am currently teaching college prep computer science to high school students and using this edition. It is wonderful! There are step-by-step lessons, with pictures of what you should see on your computer screen. At the end of every chapter there are true/false question, multiple choice matching, discussions questions, drills and challenging exercises. There are three levels to this series: Basic, Intermediate and Advance. As a teacher I found Prentice Hall's internet connection with the book extremely helpful. They have a web site for students and teachers. The web site contains practice files and study guides (by lesson) for the students, and Powerpoint presentations and solutions for the teacher. What more could you ask for!"
2,Not up to snuff,"As a graphic designer I've been happily using adobe products since 1990. The latest release, Creative Suite 3, is an uncharacteristic exception. Acrobat locks my machine and I haven't been able to open a .pdf file successfully yet since installing CS3 (had to uninstall the Acrobat App). Photoshop is very slow with odd periodic freezes for no apparent reason and crashes frequenty. They've also messed up some of the refined workflow within the interface. Flash takes far to long to start up. Overall I'm more happy with prior versions and much more productive with them. The only positive note so far is the ability to copy vector files cleanly and accurately into Flash from Illustrator. I wouldn't recommend this product in it's current state."
2,Wait for the upgrade!,"Don't be fooled. This product is very buggy. Flash crashes often, especially when the debugger is on. Photoshop often hangs for no apparent reason and decides to come back to life after 60 seconds or so. All suite apps are extreeeeeemly slow at start up. The performance enhancements you got from you Mac Intel are once again devoured by a behemoth software package. Maybe it attemps to be too many things for too many people. Adobe competes with Microsoft for the bloatware award."
1,"Overpromised, Underdelivered","I was hoping Adobe would fix a lot of the bugs in Dreamweaver (especially, the horrible slowness on the Mac platform) but it seems they ignored Dreamweaver altogether and focused on redoing their own products.Avoid if you can."
5,Excellent Upgrade,"I cannot emphasize how much easier it has become to navigate The Creative Suite interface. The UI has evolved into one that is both clean and attractive, while becoming much more customizable. CS3 offers much better integration between applications and has some really cool new additions."
1,Boring.Cute cover but no plot,"I'm a fan of animation( all types not just anime)and let me tell you please please PLEASE don't buy this anime without knowing what it is about. I bought this anime, thinking it would be a great quality anime with story and great animation. The art on the cover was very appealing and cute! I'm a girl I like cute.Cute goes only so far.....There was hardly no plot(boring),the animation was horrible (I seen better animation in a 80s cartoon!)humor failed,and it just sucked.Sorry, but if you don't mind poor animation, unfunny jokes(Gema was seen in blackface in the intro,yeah thats funny),and no motion plot.Its for you.I should have bought a King of Hill dvd set, much better animation and humor. Humor that I can understand."
4,"""when your heart is weak","MTV...the 80's remember the first yr for MTV..well i do and this Group really had the fire going...with it's first and only hit on MTV ""when your heart is weak""...this band cooked up some slow-country-rock..fire with this song....vocals and production ,being the 80's was up to par and beyond,that of most MTV productions for this time.....what can i say...this group should have had more chances to live the video dream......."
1,wrong perforfer on this disc,I ordered this dvd for Angela Lansbury and it arrived with her name on it so I opened the box .On screen came up Patricia Routledge which I already have.So do not buy this unless you are sure the contents are as shown on the boxPRINCE RAFAEL
3,It is what it claims to be,This is a memoir of Ayke Agus. I could have wished that she had remembered more the the details of Heifetz the artist and teacher. For example she says that he sent some students back to etudes and then says that he played them all himself. Whih ones and why? We want to know. But at the end of the day it is a valuable insight in to a fascinating subject. A good read and worth the proce
1,Not recommended,Too much jargon and not enough information related to consulting. As a self-help book there are much better books on the market. The reading of the book for the tape is stilted and awkward. If you want to check out this book I recommend the book over the tape set. That way you can pick and choose what you want to review and return it if you don't like it.
1,Pop psychology run amok!,"My dictionary defines amok as: In or into a jumbled or confused state. This describes this tape series, or at least what I could stand to listen to. It used manufactured jargon that is hard to listen to or understand. I never did understand the point of what he was trying to say. Plus the book is read in an awkward way by the author. It sounds too much like reading, not as if he were speaking to me. I returned these tapes but be aware that Amazon may not let you return opened tapes. If you are interested in this information I would recommend you buy the book. That way you'll be able to return it if you don't like it."
5,MUST HAVE BOOK FOR ANY PARENT OF AN AUTISTIC CHILD!,"Written by an MD-grandmother of an autistic child, Children with Starving Brains is an outstanding manual for biomedical intervention to help these sick kids! Dr. McCandless is thorough and stays on the cutting edge of the newest treatments for helping these kids overcome their metabolic/physiological disturbances and their inability to detoxify their own bodies.Dietary interventions, vitamin therapies and detox/chelation therapies....all of which are covered in Dr. McCandless' book, have proven invaluable to thousands of autistic children and their families. Implementation is not easy, but then neither is having an autistic child. Only when these issues are addressed can many of these children benefit from educational interventions and therapies.I wish I'd found Dr. McCandless years ago. My son has benefited immensely from her knowledge and dedication to these kids.GET THIS BOOK, NOW!"
5,Children With Starving Brains Need to be Understood!,Children With Starving Brains is a wonderful book to understand the medical side of treating Autism. This book is a truly a labor of love and the book is very informative.
1,A lot of anecdotal stories but no scientific evidence.,"A lot of anecdotal stories but no scientific evidence. The author's granddaughter never overcame autiism! But they --like all of us-- will keep on trying!! Another book about individual stuff but never was an experimental study mentioned. At the end, regardless of anecdotal accounts, the cure for autism was never achieved,. People should be aware that non scientific data will never provide an answer to cure. Another non scientific book on the cure of autism written by a medical person and one not based on scientific facts. PLEASE stop building up hope not based on scientific procedures!!"
5,Nice easy Read. I really enjoy reading this informative book,"I LIKE THE STYLE OF THIS BOOK. The author keeps it interesting. Its a good Guide. I have a child with Autism and I am starting to use all the interventional approaches and have had blood tests etc for my son and he does need to eliminate certain foods. I have tried supplements and they has shown a positive result. Its all very exciting as I feel that my finger is on the button and I know that if I do certain things my severely autistic child will improve.Science is very exciting right now on their discoveries and that doesnt just include autism, but aspergers, learning disabilities, asthma, eczema, ADHD, plus supplements are helping alkzeimers, etc. Just visit the Autism Research Institute to find out more information and studies etc."
2,"Too technical/medical, not a practical one","This is probably good for medical student. For parent, the whole book can be reduced to 10-20 pages."
1,disappointing if you want real science,Having worked with children with autism in a medical setting I had hoped that this was going to be a much more serious book. Instead it is a lot of recycled pseudoscience. Parents would be better off investing in interventions that have proven to be effective!
5,A MUST READ FOR PARENTS FIGHTING AUTISM,"I have been fighting autism for over eight years. My daughter has made significant progress, but still has a way to go. I wish that this book had been available when we first started out. It is a concise guide to the current biomedical treatments that are being used successfully in fighting against autism today. It is absolutely the #1 book that I recommend to other parents to read, especially newcomers or people that are interested, but don't have loads of time to search for information. I have a deep and abiding respect for Dr. McCandless and her openness to share herself so unselfishly with all the parents that bombard her with questions. I am looking forward to the new edition of this book!! Don't wait - get this book, start reading and make your plan!"
3,Version year would have been helpful in my decision to purchase,"I was expecting the 2009 version, not the 2007. I wish that was indicated in the description. There is a lot more info I could use in the 2009 version."
5,A book especially for PROFESSIONAL or EXPERT users,"One of the frustrations that I had in deciding on a book to purchase, to use along with Photoshop 5, was that the books being so expensive, (generally), I didn't want to purchase one just so that in a few months, after having worked my way through the whole thing, I could put it on my shelf and forget about it. I wanted something that would continue to be useful to me for a long time, and that would teach me some advanced techniques. None of the beginner books had that, and they were all more beginner level than advanced. This book was like a dream come true. It shows how to do advanced techniques, without getting bogged down in the beginner level ""click here, click there, etc.""In short, for advanced users, (or for those who aspire to one day become advanced users), this is the PERFECT book."
2,Rambling! Stick to the point! Find an editor! Please!,"Why must I read 3 paragraphs on Canadian football to learn how to manage Photoshop's separation settings. Someone find this guy an editor! ""The Color PC"" is a much better book. Unfortunately it is out of print."
3,If you want to learn Curves color separation buy this book,"Mr. Margulis is a devout anti-calibrationist. His is also a one track photo-processor in this book. It is virtually all about Curves and very little else. Although he does not doctor images to make them applicable to Curves, I found it difficult to distinguish much more than personal preference changes in many of his examples. If you do not have a natural ability to distinguish 2500 colors and are able to look at the grayscale versions of each of the color channels and tell exactly what the true color of the image is then you may find it difficult to follow this book. This book is much better than his first book; but still does not address how he uses PS 5 in enough detail to help any but the true professional."
1,Too much verbiage that is not related to the subject,This book was obviously written with unneeded verbiage in order to make a large volume. The verbiage simply works to confuse the reader. The subject could be well covered in about one third of the text and would then be much easier to understand. Some of the methods described as the only way to do something are way off the mark. There are easier simpler ways. Not a book to use for this subject.
5,There IS an UltraDev Book!!!!!,"Until this book there was no UltraDev book...I've looked at several others and could find no reason to buy them...However this book is loaded with real world answers...The writting is clear and to the point, the reasons ""why"" you are doing something and how it relates to where you are trying to end at is a hugh help...I bought Drumbeat2000 just before Macromedia purchased the company...The few Drumbeat books were sparse on info, the UltraDev 1 books also were not much help...Now that UltraDev 4 is here there is finally a book to help the users reach all the power that this great program has to offer... I've mostly been a static site hand coder using Homesite...This book answers the need I had, trying to move to database connected sites for our intranet...I did not know JavaScript or ASP thus the reason for UltraDev...This book has made the learning curve much shorter and bearable!!!...A really great book, buy it!!!........"
2,"Useless as a reference, horrible index","This book fails completely as a reference, but does well as a tutorial. It does not go in depth enough in many scripting areas , and has a horrible index. I can never find what I need in the index, and have to resort to looking through half the book to find it. If you want to get a real reference book, don't buy this book. I consider this a one-time use tutorial book."
2,More dreamweaver than ultradev,Reading this book is a true waste of time and money if you already know the basics of dreamweaver and are looking for more substantial information and examples to harness the power of database connectivity. It is extremely lacking in its coverage of Ultradev so much so that a book I purchased as an intro guide covers far more relevant and useful topics than this one(not to mention costing alot less). If you are looking for a more indepth guide to Ultradev I suggest you keep on looking.
2,Not enough Dreamweaver Ultradev,"First, the book does not even get into databases until you are half way through the book. The coverage of the database features and explanations are anything but complete. Second, some new features are not even covered! The book does a good job with working examples, but does not explain them well!"
2,Bulk without substance,"This book tries to cover too many bases. It explains what you can do with Ultradev, without really explaining how to do it. They waist a lot of time on very general discussions of database design, SQL statements, and planning a web site. It contains gems such as understanding your target audience: ""Does my audience have computers?"" Yes they actually say that! Meanwhile you will go nuts trying to find the real content. If you really want to learn Dreamweaver UltraDev, this book is probably too general."
2,I got screwed...,"I bought this book online and it didn't have a CD; someone had ripped it out of the sleeve in the back cover. I contacted the author and publisher listed in the jacket, and so it's been 2 months and I STILL DON'T HAVE THE CD. They seem to think that I'm trying to rip them off or something!From what I have read in the book, it seems pretty good and informative, but so far I've attempted finding coding examples for several specific problems using the index and haven't found any answers yet."
2,Not what I had hoped.,"It's a very good reference (as the title suggests), but isn't really appropriate for beginners.I had hoped to use this as a training guide for a group of designers learning interactive programming, but it just doesn't quite fit the bill.If you're looking for a nicely indexed reference, however, pick one up."
1,weak,"Too much detail on the code and no actual help on UltraDev itself. No ""work though"" tutorial. Seams to repeat information over and over again in different ways without showing any specific working example. It mentions very interesing features but then breases over the details. I had 3 very simple and basic question before I purchased this book. This book mentioned all of them and does say they're possible but doesn't say how to actually do them. It didn't answer any of my questions. I bought this after reading the other reviews and was very dissapointed. (Basically an extended and drawn out version of the manual)"
3,Another Reference,"This book does slightly better than other references in explaining the technologies that UltraDev exploits, but it is actually weak in terms of actual information about UltraDev. Unfortunately for those who are new to UltraDev, you will find that the information is not presented in a learner-friendly style. I would recommend this book to a middle-of-the-road UltraDev user who does not have a strong background in coding. All others, look elsewhere."
2,Blah,"Unfortunately, this is one product that I can't rate highly. I purchased it to use at the gym, but I find that the quality of the sound and the ability to access stations is very bad. I know that this may be caused by the natural interference at the gym, but I expected more because of all of the other quality Sony products I own."
1,Unstable,"This program is buggy. Stick with font book that comes with OSX. This release has problems with:Not saving settings, not loading fonts correctly for use, constant conflict problems, Ive had multiple problems with the program crashing on startup requiring me to go in and manually clean out fonts. I never write reviews but the amount of headache this program has given me prompted me to spread the word. AVOID SUITCASE AT ALL COSTS!"
1,Not the 'must-have' solution it used to be!,"I've been a Macintosh consultant to graphic artists for over 15 years. Suitcase was always THE solution for font management. However, Extensis was never able to get X1 working under Mac OS X. I suggest you avoid this version at all costs. After several rounds with Extensis tech support, whose advice consisted mostly of ineffective and unhelpful (but lengthy) procedures, I gave up and switched to FontAgent Pro. I haven't had a SINGLE crash in the year since I made that move. Compare that with the almost daily crashes of Suitcase X1 under Mac OS 10.4.x. Buyer beware.On the plus side (hehe) the included FontDoctor and Font Book are great little programs. They can be purchased separately, however."
1,poorly done,I have always been interested in this book being a student of the the Civil War. This book is scan of the original book with no proofing done. It is filled with typos and the tables are impossible to read and comprehend.
4,Beautiful ring at a good value!,This ring is beautiful and looks better in person. The setting is different and I have received many compliments on it! The ring is also true to size. I am pleased with this purchase.
2,Meh.,"Shipping was super fast! However, the ring looked pretty cheap. Not terribly so, but still very cheap. The stone in mine was a little lopsided, so that didn't help it much. Overall, a ""meh""."
3,want some cheese?,"I found this really funny. But it is nothing more than mindless fan service, so if you dont like that stay away."
1,THIS IS FOR THE PACKAGING ONLY!,"The anime is great. I didn't like it at first but it eventually grew on me & I have no issues with it.Now, the package it comes in. Christ!1st) The thickness of the box is as if they combined two regular sized DVD cases. The good thing is that it's hard enough to protect from external smashing to a degree.2nd) There is nothing inside of it except the 4 DVDs & a hard foam buffer.3rd) The DVDs themselves are all stacked on top of each other, on one side with NOTHING in between. I nearly broke one DVD by trying to take it out of the case. This type of packaging is dangerous because you can easily damage the each disc."
1,less than the epitome of average. Terrible for that matter.,"Your average series is an ecchi series, which means perverted. This series is perverted, but that usually doesn't bring a anime down, since ecchi is a cliche genre of the '00s.In this series I've seen absolutely nothing original. Everything is cliche. Many of the cliche elements are even repeated throughout the series. You see tenticle rape 3-4 times in this series. Tenticle rape at least once is unavoidable in an ecchi series, but repeated is unacceptable.All the characters fit common anime cliches. Loli Characters, powerful characters, weak minded male lead, cutesy creatures, memory loss endings, lack of plot, love harems, hot school nurses, hot spring episodes, sex and mainly more. This series has absolutely no appeal to it at all. The best episodes are the first 3, and the last 2. Other than that there is no point watching this series."
2,A book for very patient beginners,"I expected much more from this book, specially if its title says ""Mastering."" Although the author claims he will be hands-on and practical, in fact he elaborates on only few examples preceeded by interminable explanations. For example, the first 100 pages contain only 4 very simple and concrete cases using macros and the rest is an agonizing explanation on each and all of the components of several menus. No concrete examples that would enable the reader to cement his knowledge on solid ground.On ocassions the author explains VBA for an specific application, say Word, but then he changes to give general explanations for all applications at once, disorderly mentioning exceptions for Excel, Word, Project or PowerPoint, what makes the reading difficult.No, this book is not for me. I need principles and theory handsomely applied in concrete cases."
3,For the non programmer,"This book should be called ""Programming 101 with VBA"". The author spends pages discussing inefficient sorts and searches that can be found in any other book.If you don't know anything about programming, and what to know how to get the most of your applications - this may be for you.Don't buy this if you already know VB and want to learn some of the andvanced features of VBA."
1,The item is mislabeled.,"Look at the third enlargeable image of the product on Amazon. Look at the white bar-code strip. In the last line it clearly reads DP/N 09364U. That is the part number for the 70 watt, 3.5 amp AC adapter. It is not interchangeable for the 6G356 which is a 90 watt, 4.5 amp product. The BIOS in the Dell latitude C840 detects the difference and sends a warning message when one attempts to use the 3.5 amp adapter. I don't necessarily blame the vendor. It sent the product shown in the photo. But the vendors and Amazon between them should have the expertise to eliminate this error in labelling. It cost me many valuable days."
1,Not Comatible with Inspiron 1100,"Received this item and promptly received an error message upon boot-up in my BIOS that it was not compatible. Also the connection that plugs into the laptop was loose and it was difficult to keep it in place so it would charge. The power cord portion was much shorter than the original that came from Dell, but if that was the only problem I could have just used that one with this replacement. The real problem was the error message and the difficulty in getting it to stay connected. This will be returned as it will not work for me with this laptop."
1,AC adapter,Not a good product. I bought AC adapter for my dell inspiron 5100 and it was listed as new but i got a refurbished one.
1,Crappy,"This item was shipped fast, however the plug would not fit into the charger port. I had to cut the thing down so it would fit! Ugh"
4,great product ... and so inexpensive!,thanks for the adapter. a little shorter than the one I use in my office but it works just fine and arrived the day I came home from the hospital and started my maternity leave. perfect timing!!
1,Dell Power Cord,Said that the product would work with Dell Inspiron 5100 but it did not. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT FOR INSPIRON PRODUCTS!!!!
4,What you see is what you get,It was exactly what I thought I was buying. The only thing I don't like about this product is the plug into the laptop doesn't 'click' into place and falls out all of the time.
3,"Works, but for how long?","Use:Daily, school, often use with battery out and powered by this unit only (to reduce heat inside laptop, issue unrelated to this product)Pros:LightweightWorks as describedDoes not get too hotCons:Construction seems too light, Dell version much heavier constructionOverall:Hoping the unit will last at least as long as the battery."
3,Computer adapter on time,Everything worked out great. My item was at my door sooner than I had expected!
1,Not worth it.,"Product was as ordered, but did not power the laptop. Total waste of money. Not worth returning."
1,Cheap quality. Does work.,"The battery charger works, but is very poor quality. My charger gets extremely/dangerously hot in a short time period. The plastic casing around the main portion is already deforming from the heat. I am worried it will catch on fire. I will have to order a new charger."
4,"Good Price, Good service, Cheap Adapter","This is the exact same adapter that came with the computer. It's half the price of buying direct from Dell. It is a cheap adapter, but so was the one that came with the computer. So no complaints here, and they even shipped priority mail, which was nice."
3,Quick Read,"This is certainly a much quicker guide to parliamentary procedure than Robert's Rules of Order, Newly Revised, 10th edition. I read the entire thing in less than three hours.On the other hand, parliamentary procedure is much like a language. It is a set of standards which will vary in formality and strictness according to the participants, time, and place. Dr. Keesey seems to argue that there is never an appropriate time for formality.A parliamentary authority, like Robert's Rules or Modern Parliamentary Procedure, plays the part in parliamentary law that a dictionary plays in language. As such, it is required not only to offer a definition, but also to reflect current and historical practice. Dr.Keesey has obtained a significant reduction in the rules of parliamentary procedure by dropping a number of common motions and rules. And much like Esperanto, it feels more like a product based on one man's opinion than on the hundreds of years of development of modern parliamentary procedure."
4,To Serve is To Lead,"This is a thoughtful book of Joseph Jaworski's heroic journey to find his professional destiny. Yes, he even offers a Joseph Campbell Model of the mythical journey. I enjoyed many of the resources and quotes offered. In addition Peter Senge offers a beautifully written comprehensive introduction that hits on the main points of the entire book.Perhaps the point that most resonated for me was the concept service and the desire to serve as being a critical aspect of leadership. So much about leadership is about strength, clarity, sometimes power. It is important that this strength, clarity and power be tempred by a desire to serve others and concepts larger than oneself.Enjoy."
3,A Solid Read!,"Joseph Jaworski was a practicing litigator when he learned about the concept of the ""servant leader."" Inspired, he left his legal practice and created the American Leadership Forum (ALF), which trains corporate leaders in using the servant-leader model. Synchronicty, which recounts Jaworski's journey, aspires to novelistic drama, and in fact, Jaworski describes the tale in terms of the traditional literary hero's quest. While not exactly the labors of Hercules, anecdotes in which Jaworski talks his way out of a mugging and meets his wife by passing her in an airport are entertaining, but less informative than the author might hope. The book contains a lot of New-Age jargon and collective-consciousness sermonizing. Nevertheless, for managers who want to be something more - leaders - we [...] recommend Synchronicity not as a useful how-to, but rather as a business leader's inspirational biography."
2,Woeful waste of Time,"This book was recommended to me by my mentee who is in business school. I had high hopes which remained just that... high hopes unfulfilled. There seems to be great potential in the beginning, but the author gets bogged down in retelling his own story (which he seems rather proud of despite accounts to the contrary in the introduction), and never truly gets his arms around 'the flow'. Just goes to show that some things you have to do, not read..."
1,Uh-huh...,"A feel good book. I really don't know what one might desire out of this. It is but another, in this case, large adventure in human self-indulgence. I'm happy the author found his ""peace"" in life. Yet, this is a very empty book. There's not much here - beyond the seemingly endless capacity a person has for fooling himself. This little book was about the worst piece of tomfoolery I've ever been party to..."
2,Synchronicity: The Inner Path of Leadership,"Ideas of Grandiosity.I would suggest that the individuals mentioned in this book be interviewed for their version of the experiences. Then determine if this book has taken some ""fictional"" license. But wouldn't we all like to paint a fantastic autobiographical picture of ourselves especially if our lineage had someone truly outstanding in it."
5,A turning point in how I approach life,"This book will appeal to those who study and work with leaders and leadership... it also speaks to those who sense that authenticity, intuition and presence can unlock our path and our happiness, if only we pay attention to them consistently."
4,A good read,This is Joseph Jaworski's spiritual journey from high powered corporate attorney and big business to enlightenment via a series of supposed coincidences. I have a lot of respect for what he has accomplished.
4,An interesting perspective -,"This book developed an interesting perspective on leadership, looking inward first at one's self, in terms of developing leaderhship capacity."
1,Used?,This book was listed as Used - OK - but it was covered in blue ink and had been left in water. The pages were stuck together!
2,disappointed...,"This book was suggested to me by a dear friend. Though, the concept of servant leadership is strong, I am sure I don't want to read this book again to understand it..."
3,Misleading title...,"This book should carry the title ""Autobiography of Joe Jaworski"".I bought the book because I wanted to know more about Jung's Synchronicity, it is not... I give it 2 stars as a book on synchronicity (for good articles check out the Namaste newsletters by Deepak Chopra) and 4 as a autobiography, that's why the 3 stars on average (no rocket science here).The conversations with David Bohm are the parts I liked in particular. The rest is the story of a remarkable and impressive career."
5,Becoming What You Want,"Just the introduction of this book is enough to change your life. Senge talks of creating ""predictable miracles"". It's chilling. The notion of not pursuing, of becoming what it is we're looking for, and then letting events unfold is so profound. Jaworski talks of a world of passion without the need to control. He brings that little voice from the bicameral chamber of the mind to the forefront. Get passionate. Go do things. Then listen to the little voice and be available when opportunites or change come your way."
2,Don't get grinched,"It's a fun game, and once you figure out the puzzles, grinching Whoville is entertaining. But finding what you need takes forever, since you get no hints. The graphics are terrible: flat and unimaginative. Music and sound effects get repetitive fast. I am returning this game to the store and finding something else.Please don't buy this game unless you have a lot of time and patience to spend on it."
1,Konami....What Is Going On Here?,"Not quite sure what happened with the folks over at Konami; they usually make quality games on several different platforms. Not this time. The Grinch suffers all across the board. The graphics are hurting and look funny; and trying to figure out just what you are supposed to do is basically impossible. I spent about 30 minutes trying to navigate the first board, and about an hour later the game hadn't gotten any better so I put it back in the box and returned it."
2,Fun........unless you have something else.,"Man, I don't know. It's weird. It seems as though this game was solely made as extra propheting for the movie. Now that no one has the movie----which was a passing fase-----no one will buy the game. I don't know. It's fun but to rate a game E when it should be T. I mean, seriously. Why? Your whole objective is to ruin Christmas. So.... It seems like Grand Theft Auto for 3 year olds. No that I don't like this game. It's a great time killer. My friends little brother says"" ouch"" when he does a pancake. It's a pretty fun game. Nothing compared to Star Wars though. It's good to rent maybe once and beat it, but not good to play over and over, though. See what I mean? ..."
4,The Grinch,The grinch was a fun game and full of excitement and adventure....i loved it so much! if you are looking for a game thats a challenge and full of surprises then this is the game for you! Any way thanks for the game and i hope that you like this game as much as i did :)
2,Very Difficult,"I agree with other reviewers that this game is very difficult and frustrating. Even with the internet hints, it's still a trial. I recieved this last christmas got to the third level and haven't played it since. I love the music, and the graphics weren't as bad as people make it to be, but when you can't play the game, this doesn't make up for it."
4,Good game,"This game is great, but it is directed towards the wrong audience. This game will not be very simple for the children which are the target of the grinch movie, and it will turn away teenagers and older gamers because it is called the grinch. THis game is great and people jsut need to give it a chance."
5,BEST GAME EVER!!!,THIS IS A REALLY GREAT GAME OK GRAPHICS AND STORY LINE RULES BUT OVERALL THIS GAME IS AWSOME!!!
4,Christmas Lover,"I love this game 'cause im just one of those people who sing jingle bells in the middle of the summer cause i love the christmas spirit. when i saw this i thought, hmmmm, ITS MINE but there are a few downs like its really hard to do something but while you are doing it it is fun! Its not that good when it comes to following the story line but other than that you can be the grinch, max, and.... well the grinch and max. I give it 5 stars because its just a christmas..ie kind of game!"
5,Excellent game,"Nice graphics, challenging even for the experienced gamer, if you enjoy arcade style gaming!"
5,Good things come to those who wait.,"Patience is a virtue and author Robert Klose proves it in his story of a single's man's quest for adopting a son. As a mother of three I found myself laughing, crying and actually relating to his story. His never ending fight to find the love of his life, a son that is hundreds of thousands of miles away is breath taking. I had to make myself put the book down to do my daily activities, all the while thinking of the book and what would take place the next time I could read again. I would reccommend this book to anyone, of any gender or marital status, either wanting to adopt or all ready having children. Mr. Klose reminds all parents to live for today with our children, that every moment counts, and that good things do come to those who struggle, persevere and overcome!"
3,Cylon Gold Commander,"I received the Gold Cylon Commander in a very attracive box. This product is made by Joyride. At fist glance, this product is a very good representation of the Cylons of the ""old"" Battle Star Galactica. And this Cylon is fairly real looking. I did notice a few flaws though. There were some chips in the gold armor and the red dot for the Cylon eye looks cheesy. A red LED light going back and forth would have been real cool! I also noticed that the hands were hard to positon to hold the rifle, and wanted to come off. With a better job of quality control, this would have been an excellant product instead of an average one. Out of 5 stars, I would rate this product a 3."
5,Great AHC collection.,"A great collection. Basically the CD pulls all but two tracks from the early AHC LP's ""Off the Beaten Path"" and ""Drastic Season"" onto one CD."
4,8 light chandelier,Matched the the lanterns purchased previously. Looks really nice. WishI had gone a little smaller for the space. Dimmer switch will be added soon.
1,"Old version, not for Adobe's Robohelp 7",Just a friendly warning that this is for the old 1998 version and not the version that started shipping in 2007.
3,"Typical ""For Dummies"" Guide",It's okay but not something that does a good walk-through of using the product. My copy arrived with the CD broken in half and I have not been able to find where a download is available.
3,Robohelp 7 for Dummies,"The product arrive quickly and in great shape. The only issue was that the software loaded, but wouldn't run on my machine.I am using the book and I downloaded the trial to teach myself."
3,"Is it immoral to sell horses, then?","Jane Smiley sold a racehorse broodmare at California's premier auction house for thoroughbred racehorses. She did not ""dump"" the mare at an auction where she could have gone to slaughter.Selling horses is a normal part of owning horses, especially racehorses. Auctions are the primary method of selling racing bloodstock. Writing a book about one's experiences owning racehorses does not obligate Smiley to keep every horse she has ever owned forever. People are actually suggesting that it would have been better to kill the mare than send through the ring at Barretts???!!!!These reviews are absurd, and these reviewers need to get a life."
1,No excuse...,"For dumping your racehorse at an auction because she wasn't good enough for you.I read the book a few years ago. I wasn't terrible, but a little too touchy-feely for me (and I'm the type of person who spoils her horses), but rest assured I will never buy another book from an author that ""disposes"" of any unwanted horse at an auction. What does she think will happen to a broken down mare (she'll never be sound enough for work) that has a record of 2 unplaced starts and less than 5k in earnings? To Ms. Smiley: Show a bit of responsibility and either keep the mare or euthanize her. Use some of that book money. Don't risk her ending up at the killers."
1,worst book i ever read,"unentertaining, terrible, stupid story, no suspence or plot of any kind, horribly written - does not flow, story is retarted, and is not about the teaser phrase of ""love, money ect....."" and i'm under the impression it was written for some sort of a tax write off. it was excrutiating to finish, unfortunately for me once i start i have to finish, and i must say it did not get better. the only remotely entertaining part was when she would phone the psychic and talk about/to her horse. when i finished i did a cerimonial burning to save anyone else the agony of reading this aweful book and saving them the time involved to do so - which for me was hours, because it was so torturous. bottom line is save your time save your money. if you hate anyone you could give them this book as gift."
1,My Little Pony,"Basically, the nonfiction version of the utterly moronic Horse Heaven. Jane Smiley bought a couple of thoroughbreds who couldn't run worth a damn. This book is her attempt to recoup her losses off of you. If you're clueless enough to pay for it, that's your issue."
2,from what I read here,"....I doubt I'm going to finish the book. Obviously, the annointed Ms. Smiley can do no wrong in the critics' eyes, but even before I learned about the conservative-bashing that awaits me further on, I did not have a high opinion of this book. I found much of it dull, disjointed and vaguely annoying. Perhaps she should have chosen her equine anecdotes a bit more carefully. It's cute the first time she consults a horse psychic for her steed; the third or fourth time, you start getting this picture of a spoiled owner with way too much time and money. I love horses and horse literature, I just didn't like this book."
3,Only for horse people......,"I found the majority of this book fascinating - Smiley's accounts of her experiences with her animal communicator made me curious enough to consider contacting one just to see what my horse has to say. I found myself skipping over other parts - too much background information and theory and not enough anecdotal ""stories"".All in all, it's definitely worth reading for the horseperson, non-horsepeople just won't get it....."
5,A course of Their Own,Ordered item with no hassel and it arrived on time. Amazon does a great job and when ever there is a problem they are right there to assist.
5,Another great picture book from this company!,"This has been an excellent introduction to the ABCs for my 23 month old. We often sing the ABC song before reading the book, and now he recognizes the first 3 letters of the alphabet. I don't expect him to associate the pictures with the letters just yet, but his vocabulary has expanded with the photos on each page.I only wish that the book was in a larger format since there are sometimes so many pictures per page, though I don't think this distracts him. The size seems to be appropriate for his small hands so that he can flip through on his own."
4,Nice book,"I like this entire series of board books. They are a bit advanced for my 8 month old, however, as there are just too many things on a page, and she gets confused. Looking forward to her getting older and enjoying them."
2,too overwhelming for infants and toddlers,i was looking for a book with big pictures on each page. in this book each page is very busy with way too many pictures for each alphabet. too overwhelming for little kids. not really my kind of book
1,It doesnt download after the first title page!!!!!,I saw the reviews for this book and thought it will be good for my daughter who is 22 months old and is crazy about ABC songs. First I thought I will try the sample and sample didnt open any pages other than the first title page. It shows blank white pages if I flip the page further with the title of the book on the left top corner of the pages. I thought it was a problem with the sample so went ahead buying the book. Sadly event the downloaded book doesnt have any pages beyond the the colorful title of the book. Also it wont even scroll beyond 1% if I try to scroll. and at somepoint I see a wait round cursor telling me some kind of refresh is happening but then it is gone. Now my daughter knows the book exists on her kindle and is disappointed when there is nothing to read in it!!!!!
5,Bigger is Better,"When I got this book, I was totally overwhelmed. It's only 1400 pages. I am new to Corel but this book brought me up to speed quickly. Just the CD ROM that is included with this book is worth the price alone. Alot of the book is still a mystery to me. The only problem with Corel is that when you start doing graphics you soon find out that there are no limitations to what you can do. Is this good or bad? If you can't make a choice of beautiful graphics, you are in for long nights fretting and many hours of wringing your hands. I rate this book from beginner to advanced. A must have."
3,Betty Boop Volume 2 - All Time Classic Cartoon VHS Video,"Description from the back of the cover:Join America's first cartoon sweetheart, Betty Boop, as she ""Boop-oop-a-doops"" her way in and out of trouble in these five fun-filled adventures! BETTY BOOP AND GRAMPY - Betty and the whole gang swing over to a party at Grampy's house! BETTY BOOP AND HENRY - Henry takes care of Betty's pet store to earn money to buy a ""Pudgy"" puppy. Pudgy in ""NOT NOW"" - Pudgy attempts to save Betty from the sour note singing of the neighborhood alley cats. JUDGE FOR A DAY - Public Pests Beware! Betty Boop has been elected judge for a day! YOU'RE NOT BUILT THAT WAY - Cute little Pudgy tries to be a bulldog bully, but Betty helps him realize that he's just not built that way. Video is in Black and White and runs 35 minutes."
4,Well Documented Factual Account,"This book is non-fiction and has documented sources for almost all statements. It is very non-biased and presents both the Mormon arguments and the anti-Mormon arguments. The reader has the information needed to make an informed decision about the personality of Brigham Young and his last living wife.The arguments both for and against polygamy are well stated. Most of the arguments are simply quotations from documented sources.The book is somewhat difficult to read because of the biographical nature of the material and the chronological progression. However, the difficulty is well worth the effort for a reader searching for information on life in an American harem."
2,"Okay Writing, Partially Reliable History","Irving Wallace liked to write what were, for his day, very racy -- and very profitable -- novels. So it's natural that he was attracted to the story of Ann Eliza Webb Dee Young Denning, the serially married onetime polygamous wife of Brigham Young, and that he tended to play up the same kinds of things that he emphasized in his more obviously fictional books.At least Ann Eliza comes across, in Wallace's recounting, as somewhat less perfect (and just a bit more believably real) than she does in her own exposé/memoirs, which were based upon her profitable run as a somewhat titillating paid lecturer in Victorian America.Incidentally, the book was never ""banned"" in the Mormon Church, contrary to the deliciously sinister folklore passed on by the previous reviewer. The Mormon Church has no list of ""prohibited books."""
1,AS SOUNDING BRASS,"While I was serving in Germany in the military a fellow soldier tossed a copy of Wallace's ""The 27th Wife"" as challenged me to refult it. When I returned home I came accross a book titled AS SOUNDING BRASS by Hugh Nibley. This book shows the sources for the majority of anti-Mormon litature and takes Wallace's book to task page by page, showing where his sources came from. If you are looking for something the verify your dislike for the LDS Church then ""The 27th Wife"" will be a good read. But if you'd like to learn the truth about that book then read AS SOUNDING BRASS."
3,Leaky,"The gun I got was a little leaky, but this is a manufacturing error, not the seller. I was still happy to have a cute little squirtgun, but keep in mind it is smaller scale."
1,poor attitude of peona,"This is a repeat post cos I ordered 2 rings from peony at the same time. Mistake!Size 10 turns out to be size 12 at least. Most importantly, no response when I ask for a change back to the correct size. I'm not even asking for a refund. I do not understand why the rating is 90+% given such service. Perhaps it's fake data. And amazon.com is adopting a hands-off attitude. Buy only if u want to take the chance that they deliver the correct thing!"
5,Fascinating,This book is excelent from a woman point of view specially women from developing countries. It is very exiting and advanturers. Maybe love will concure after all.
5,Absolutely Incredible,"I just read this book, and I am amazed. I wouldn't be surprised if science hasn't already made strides in the fields mentioned in this book. And if this information were to fall into the wrong hands, the results would be catastrophic. And although it has not yet been proven, I would not be the least bit surprised to learn that Adolph Hitler was trying to build the nazi super-soldier. He experiment with just about everything else."
5,Best garage storage available,"I've been using the John Sterling shelving system for years. I used to buy parts at Home Depot, but they stopped selling it about 5 years ago. I started to buy them through Amazon, but their availablility was spotty and some orders took more than 3 months to deliver. The best place to buy the parts is through Ace Hardware and Aubuchon Hardware."
3,Caution different styles,"There are two types of wall standards. The shelf brackets for standard won't fit the other standard and vice versa. On one type of bracket the hook part is on top of the bracket and the other it's on the bottom. The slots are different size on the different standards,"
4,Strong chain. Looks awesome!,"It's a chain. It looks good. It's super strong! Pretty heavy.Dinging one star only because it's hard to find a chain breaker to join it right. The plates are very thick, so it won't fit in a lot of tools for joining (Park CT-5 was too small). I was able to join it with a Park CT-7, but it was too big (CT-7 is not recommended for 3/32"" chains). I had to improvise with a shim at the rear of the tool to press it together right, otherwise it'd be too loose at the join point. But that did work. PIA, and the CT-7 cost as much as 3 chains..."
3,Single speed chain,"100+ miles of single track on my converted Fetish single speed. I'm a clyde running 32-18 gearing and the chain line and length was perfect for running without a chain tensioner, something I couldn't do with my old chain. We'll see if I can break this one."
4,Good book for beginners,Reviewer Jay missed the point. The book is clearly for beginners and does a good job of informing them. In this field there are varying levels of expertise so the book buyer should keep that in mind when purchasing a book. I for one found the book to be informative and worthwhile for my particular level of expertise
4,WEBDB Well written for beginners,"I have been an Oracle DBA for several years, and I still find this book to be of great help in developing Web applications.I have developed about three systems that in production now, and could have spent time searching users guide for information on WEBDB functionalities, but the book helped me find what I was looking for fast.I am starting on site building and I believe that I will get all the help I need from the book.Every Webdb developer should have this book as a reference."
3,Very good beginner's book albeit theoretical in nature.,"I have used this book as a handbook reference in teaching advanced Oracle & Relational Database Development. As I metioned, it is a very good theoretical book. I particularly liked Chapters 3 (WebDB), 4 (OAS) & 9 (XML). Should you require more hands on examples & sample usage, however, you will have to look elsewhere."
1,Won't work on any recent PC or Mac!,"I can't get this software to work on an xp or a mac...I would love to know if there is some sort of update out there. I bought World History 2.0, History Explorer and Science Explorer...none of them will work."
4,Loved it in North Carolina!,"Boris Starling, why had I not heard of you? Buying Storm along with other books this past weekend, simply by reading the back jackets, I had no idea of the talent of this writer. I read this book in 2 days but tried to stay up all night to finish it. I won't bother you with the story line since others who reviewed it have given that, just to tell you that he has a wonderful voice and Storm is a welcome addition to this genre. Although I guessed the identity of the killer early on, it was fun to read along checking to see if I had guessed correctly! Red Medcalfe is a fascinating character and I can't wait to read Messiah to learn more about him. And I enjoyed Mr. Starling's metaphors, although we say the expressions a little differently here in the States! Keep writing! I'm going out now to see if I can find Messiah!!"
2,"After reading Messiah, Storm is quite a Disappointment","I waited patiently for Boris Starling's next novel, after reading Messiah. Messiah is probably the best novel of this genre that I have ever read. Storm on the other hand is somewhat unfocused and realy does not make a clear connection between the two main plotlines. The novel drags on and on trying to give us some insight into the mindset of DCI Beauchamp and is quite boring at times. Furthermore, the re-introduction of Redfern Metcalfe, the hero of Messiah, seems like a cheap take on the Hannibal Lecter character, except that the reader is never really given an insight into his situation other than the fact that at the end of Messiah, he decides that he has crossed over the line between good and evil. By giving Metcalfe a larger portion of this story, Storm could have been a much better book."
4,slow but the action gets on,This book was great to read. I will admit it was slow at first but then it took off with a bang. It twists and turns and you never know who the killer is until Boris tells you. The twists are done by a true master.
3,A lot like reading Dickens...,"This series is being transferred to dvd under several names, so read the reviews for the other ""Flash Gordon"" sets on Amazon. There are plenty of great reviews attached to the alternate titles so I will only add that watching this series is one of those experiences that seems so unpromising at the outset and so rewarding by the end...kind of like reading a Dickens novel...by about the 4th episode the acting, costume and sets fall into place with unexpectedly stylish bikinis, Buster Crabbe in his double-breasted short coats, sets framed with stylish art deco doors and windows, and savagely naive robots and rock monsters giving the whole a kind of archaic charm. If you like sci-fi and fantasy your suffering through episodes 1-3 will be rewarded..."
4,Beginner level...,"This book is a really good book for all of you who are staring to learn html. It is easy to read and well structured. It will not only teach you tags to program your web page with, but also how to use ftp and a little about how the net is organized. And it comes with a cd full of all sorts of goodies...If you are an experienced html programmer,however, this one will not do much for you. It sweeps into most of the parts of html, but never deep enough for you to get a real and thorough understanding of the topics, especially Dynamic html. So, if you want to learn javascript or cascading stylesheets, get a different book- you won't need all the html basics that Html 4.0 covers. Avoid the html 4.0 books and look for a pure Javascript, Cascading Stylesheet or Dynamic Html book...:)"
3,Bell Sonecor Micro-Cassette Tele-Recorder,"So far, the Bell Sonecor performs OK. It came with the springdetached from the Cassette door, which keeps the door from being held firmly shut. Better 'quality control' would have prevented this.It is difficult to remount the spring because of possible damage to the unit in the process and components are mostly plastic.I am using it as is.Returning it for exchange is not worth the expense involved."
1,A disappointment,"Simply put, the book lacks content. Not only are the words and paragraphs rather sparsely distributed throughout the pages, but little knowledge is actually shared with the reader.The authors appear to want to impart a lyric quality to the work, perhaps akin to poetry. Rather, the incessant drumbeat of short, choppy sentences is distracting. The mantric use of pronouns in the first-person plural is likewise grating -- the authors certainly don't speak for me."
4,Beautiful and Simple Way to introduce the Complex(ity),"This book is special for two reasons: #1 the book itself is beautiful in graphics, typography and shape, #2 the text pleasantly guides the novice into the realm of the subject of complexity.This is the book I always advice to those who want to 'get into' the subject."
3,Complex Dynamical Systems Theory for Managers,"Margaret Wheatley does an excellent job outlining what's wrong with earlier management theories. She then summarizes why theories about complex dynamical systems (complex adaptive systems, self-organizing systems -- whatever names they variously go by!) are better suited as metaphors for management.For those who can apply the theories to management issues themselves, a more in-depth explanation of the theories is found in Paul Cilliers' Complexity and Postmodernism, and Alicia Juarrero's Dynamics in Action: Intentional Behavior as a Complex System -- in addition to both books entitled ""Complexity"" (by Roger Lewin and Mitchell Waldrup)."
4,A Good Read!,"This beautiful work appeals to the part of you that is creative and artistic, the part that is always searching for new ways to look at the world. The book begins with a poem. The themes that follow - play, organization, self, emergence - each spin from the poem. The authors, Margaret J. Wheatley and Myron Kellner-Rogers, weave in their bold, thought-provoking views on how life seeks to organize and diversify itself out of chaos. They explore scientific concepts by Charles Darwin, Carl Sagan and other scientists, interspersing quotes from mystics and philosophers. This is an excellent book, the kind you might keep on your desk to share or on your night stand for inspiration. The loose, circular writing elegantly expresses both philosophical and scientific ideas about organization. It is soulful without being too wishy-washy. ... ."
4,A book that encourages awareness and exploration,I fortunately read this book just a couple of weeks before I was unexpectedly laid off. Keeping the book's precepts in mind made the transition unstressful and successful. An excellent setting out of a point of view that supports exploration without fear. Highly recommended.
2,Taurus,"Someone recommends me to read this book with the purpose to understand the taurus holliday, but I got disappointed because Mr. Hemingway just explain in a detailed way his experience, but I continue thinking that I cannot bear this ""Fiesta"" is a wild, absurd tradition, completely out of logic. Besides, the arrival of the package was late."
5,Martians in Maggody - Joan Hess,"This is a typical Joan Hess novel, and a pure romp from start to finish. She captures the local personalities to a tee, and has a wicked sense of humor when it comes to creating plots and outrageous situations. If you want a good laugh, Hess is one of the best. Her Maggody books always deliver."
3,small and off color,"They are smaller than I expected and the color is lighter in person. I bought them for my mother to match one of her rings and the colors do not match, according to the picture they should have. However, my mother still liked them so we kept them."
2,Small and easy to lose,"I was so excited to receive these earrings. They were smaller than I thought they'd be but I thought, lovely.I wore them twice, then lost one. I'm heartbroken, but vow to never buy anything that doesn't have a more secure backing.Maybe you'd love it but I'm disappointed...mostly at myself."
4,Good for teen - this is a very small earing,"The earings are beautiful, but very small. This would be a wonderful gift for a child or teen. If I had not received discounts bringing the price under $90 I would have sent them back.But they are beautiful. I am going to give them to my 12 year old neice for her birthday."
3,dainty hoops,"The picture of these earrings is somewhat misleading. I had expected a larger hoop. Quality is good compared to cost. If you like to wear large hoops, these probably are not for you."
4,Values Management,It is often the most difficult thing to think through your values and then derive your whole management plan for your business by it. Yet the moral success and satisfaction of your business starts from that place. It will also guide your management through some of the most difficult problems which inevitably come to challenge and see whether your values make sense.Is your house built on rock? Or is it built on sand. We want to build on the rock.
4,Insightful!,"Managing By Values uses the same simple, direct story format used in The One Minute Manager and many other Ken Blanchard books. This makes the book easy to follow as it moves from one concept to the next. This book does a good job of presenting the Managing By Values system as an idea that makes sense for a company's bottom line. It's great to have a work force that enjoys their jobs, but those jobs won't last long if a company doesn't remain profitable. Managing By Values shows that you don't have to sacrifice profit to increase worker satisfaction and that you don't have to sacrifice worker satisfaction to increase profit. The MBV process shows that increased worker satisfaction leads to increased profit. This book is written for CEOs and people in senior leadership positions."
4,Pretty good for beginners except for non-MS databases,"As a beginning Java user(I have used VB a little in the past), I found this book to be very usefull. It covers most of the visual controls in a satisfactory manner. The only letdown was its poor(almost non-existant) explanation of how to use any database other than Microsoft Access and Microsoft SQL Server, but I guess this is to be expected in a book published by Microsoft."
4,Good book for those looking to ramp up to Visual J++ 6.0,"As a developer in Visual Basic I found this book an ideal way to bridge to Visual J++. The topics were intermediate but easy enough to work through. After completing it I got a solid understanding of many areas of developing for Windows using WFC and Visual J++. Part of the ease for me in bridging to VJ from VB was that the author explained all of the code that he presented in clear terms. This is refreshing! The book's code also uses 100% of WFC in its examples and they ALL work. This is something that I found not the case in other books on VJ 6. The only area that is lacking in the book is a chapter on DHTML. Currently the book states that it is geared towards intermediate readers geared towards people developing for Windows. After completing the book and its many examples, I felt the author met this goal. I look forward to future editions of this book with even more advanced material!"
2,"Disappointing, not nearly in depth enough.","I was very disappointed with this book, it is a very basic book, only for very green beginners. Very basic coverage of JAVA/COM integration. If the source code listings were left out the book would be half the size! I learned more by sitting down and using VJ to write my own sample app, without the book."
1,Not worth my money,"It's always amazing to me why people buy books that are essentially the product manual printed out. Heck, why don't the publishers just print out the product manual and sell it. No research could have gone into this book. The examples are so basic that it makes me wonder if the authors have had more than a days lesson in java."
5,Excellent product!,We love this playard! We first purchased another brand (Evenflo Madison) and were not satisfied. This playard is by far the better choice! The set up is much easier on this one and the parent tray is wonderful! The mobile and lights/sounds did not prove to be a problem and our baby LOVES the mobile!
3,Review of Writing Word Macros,"I needed a book to carry me over from WordBasic to VBA. While the book was helpful, I found the examples woefully inadaquate.I, nor anyone else in my office, is writing a book, so the examples relating to writing 'this' book, seemed foreign. More examples of data selection and range manipulating would be more useful. However, the chapter covering tables was useful, and I refer to it often.I thought the book struggled with keeping elementary and advanced concepts seperate.I would not recommend this book for a first time macro user, but rather someone who has had some experience with Visual Basic or WordBasic."
1,Save your money.,"This book was not much help to me, goes into theory to much and not enough examples, I recommend to anyone wanting to learn VBA to buy Word 2000 Developer's Handbook by Guy Hart-Davis."
2,Not a very good book,"I think the review from ""A reader from Lawrenceville"" got it right.It is not a good book. It is mostly a list of the various classes and their properties and methods. It can be useful for getting an overview, but it soon becomes tedious.It does not cover vital suff like Word application event handling.I suppose the only reason that it still sells is that all the other Word VBA books are out of print."
2,writing word macros,"If you are looking for a concise reference to using word macros - don't bother with this book. This book is written in the style of so many ""junk books"" today that seem to market themselves around waffle thinly veneered as fact. The pages meander aimlessly around the subject without truly coming to grips with any one aspect. With this book as with so many before it, I am bound to ask whether the public at large are simple minded or just plain stupid. The book would be better served as a bed time story than to purport to be of much assistance in writing word macros. So much of the text is taken up with superfluous diction and ""as I previously have stated"" chunks of text, that any really useful information is difficult to locate and the reader would be better served to save their money and refer to the online help in VBA which, if obtuse, is at least concise."
5,Awesome!,This book presents a number of examples that can be used in Word and the best part is that they are easy to understand and they WORK!
1,Old wine a new bottle,"Having gone through Roman's Word Programming book, I thought I'd get his Word Macros and see if it took things further. They are both the same book, even if the Macros volume does claim it has ""minor updates for Word 2000 compliance."" The minor updates appear confined to a new copyright page, a new cover, and a new title."
2,Not enough thought,"The author has not really tried to be helpful. He doesn't even describe how to use the clipboard to copy and paste. Granted, this has been made more difficult in Word 2000, and requires some extra material, but it is such a fundamental issue it is hard to see how it can be completely ignored."
2,trouble with tape moving & jamming,"I love this tape gun for about the first quarter of the tape roll. Then the tape starts to move. I have an adapter, but that does not seem to help. The balance of the tape roll is constantly ""jamming"". It is very hard to make it roll. Has anyone had this problem? Is there a solution?"
5,atg adapter,if you have an atg gun is item is a must have it gives you the ability to use both 1/4 and 1/2 inch tape refills with one atg gun--who wouldn't want capability
1,This book is not for beginners!,"This book may be useful to the experienced VBA programmer. But for the novice, it's next to useless. The book contains no programming examples to speak of. The instructions on VBA are scant. The author says that he doesn't ""holdhands."" He doesn't explain EXCEL macros very well either!"
4,"Still good, even with XP","I'm adding to my review of 2 years ago because I'm amazed that even though I'm now using XP with Microsoft Office 2002, this book is still useful. Although some of the actual code is unusable (and was unusable with 97), it still points me in the right direction. I can't believe I still find information in here that can't be found in other VBA & Excel programming reference books. I have so many of them, and I always find that this book keeps me on the right track where others drop off. It's definitely true that one must keep several Excel & VBA books on hand because they all have incorrect info here and there, and no one volume covers everything. But while I will probably be letting go of a few others now that my firm has (finally) upgraded, this is one I'm gonna keep."
2,Where are the examples?,"This book has lots of reference information, but this information is already available from the on line help window. I would like to see more code examples"
2,Not for beginners,"I bought this book as a beginner in VBA and ended up learning it from totaly different source. The book lacks good examples (those in the book are very cumbersome) and detailed explanation of programming principles (debugging, objects etc.). However, if you do know the basics, you may find a nice reference for the most of common tasks."
4,Almost a good book,"This book does a really good job of quickly teaching VBA and allowing you to write macros. As an experienced programmer in everything that's not Microsoft, I was able to write my own complicated macros in a couple days. This book is lacking in an Index (a very important part of any programming book) - in fact, the index is completely useless. Roman also teaches this from a beginners perspectives so the book goes a little slow - a lot of hand holding. However, I was able to do what I needed to do and I guess I can't ask for much else."
1,Stay on the highway,"He spends considerable time dissing travel writers and their fixations for back road travels, that the ""real"" search for America belongs on the Interstates. Unwittingly, he proved their point for everytime he went in search of a story, he got off the hyways and onto the back roads. Hmmmm The author is under the misguided notion that boomers and liberals have the monopoly on good and that anyone who does not fit these narrow paramaters is an idiot. Less preaching and more driving please"
4,"FINALLY, UNDERSTANDING MODERN GREECE","Although it doesnt read very easily, this book offers a view to what modern life in Greece is like, how Greeks think and why. Highly enjoyable and recommended to understand better this Mediterranean culture."
