1,bad history. bad costumes. just plain bad.,"This is one of the worst movies to come out in years. The history is appallingly bad. It's down right offensive to anyone who knows anything at all about the Roman Empire. The costumes (which won an Oscar!) are even worse (note that the emperor's sister is wearing a Victorian corset, complete with busk, over a sari in one scene!). It's criminal that Hollywood gets away with such travesties, and is rewarded with praise and adulation for them, especially when these so called ""historical"" movies end up in our children's classrooms as study aids. Why can't the entertainment industry spend the extra five minutes to check their history, or hire a consultant? The ONLY reason to see this film is if you're a die-hard Russell Crowe fan (and even then in falls into the same group as the quick and the dead: Watch the Russell scenes, and fast forward through the rest)."
4,Connie Neilson steals every scene,"Danish actress Connie Neilson steals virtually every scene she appears in, yet rarely makes the lead credits for this high-impact film. With some re-write, this film could have become a blockbuster like Titanic which appealed to both men and women."
2,Every accent except Roman,"I got a laugh watching this movie times simply because the actors didn't even attempt to hide their true accents or try sounding Roman. And if you watch the fight scene that includes Tigers, you can see the Tigers lying down (and sleeping) in the background. I doubt that this was intentional humor.Overall, the movie was kind of a blur for the action scenes then slow and plodding during the drama. I predicted the final outcome 20 mins into the movie and was sadly correct. The script just didn't have any life to it.On the positive side, Russell Crowe has a great voice and the non-incestuous sister was very attractive. Although the computer animation was obvious, it was impressive to see Rome in all it's glory.Rent before you buy may be my best advice on this one."
1,Best Picture? Give me a break.,"I thoroughly HATED this movie. The fight scene with the tigers was visually spectacular, but that doesn't make up for a drudgingly dull plot & awful acting from Russell Crowe. He Is, in my opinion, the single most over-rated actor in the last 20 years. He has gone above and beyond when it comes to OVER ACTING, none of his roles that I've seen have been convincing OR entertaining. I am certainly not qualified to critisize an actor and nobody may find my review to be helpful, but I have to be honest in my opinions and mine is this: THIS MOVIE IS A STINKER!"
4,Pretty good,"When I watched this movie, I thought it was going to be a mindless action romp. I was proved wrong. Despite the graphic violence (I had to close my eyes on some parts), it was definitely an amazing movie. It was so beautifully filmed and acted. The characters seemed slightly odd to our standards. That just gave the feel that this really was more than one thousand years ago and almost a completely different world. Even though the fighting was gory, it was always well choreographed. Russel Crowe did a fabulous job as a brave and honorable fighter (he's awesome!), as did everyone. I definitely suggest this movie, despite the bloodiness (if that's a word). I know I haven't told much about the plot, but there really isn't a very complicated one."
5,this is the the best book,i love the people in the books sooo much kit and nita wow i just read 1 right after another and i find myself talking about it in every thing i do even when i am writeing my own little storys the always come back to the polt of these books
4,LOVED IT!,"I am an avid reader of all types of book. I was just in the bookstore at the mall located not too far from my house and looking for any book to catch my eye. I was just looking through the titles of books and the title, ""So You Want to be a Wizard"" caught my eye. So I bought the first and the second book in the Young Wizard series. After reaing the first one, I was hooked on them. These are awesome books and I can't wait to buy the fourth and fifth ones, having just two days ago bought the third one, read it, and loved it. I can't wait!"
5,Wonderful books,"I'm so glad to see these books getting the attention they deserve. I first read this book when I was fourteen; I'm twenty-eight now and I still love them. Go ahead and buy all of them, they are definitely worth it, although in my opinion, #2 is the best. Duane is a wonderful author, her writing and characters are excellent and her worlds are very well constructed."
3,"Alurring, yet confusion rans rampant.","After reading this wonderful book,I had never more wished to become a wizard. Spells always work, and the characters seem REAL! But it will puzzle you excessively.Read past the confusing parts, or ""skim"".Overall, a amazing work of art."
4,"A Little Slow, but Worth the Wait","When I first read this book, I couldn't quite catch onto it. Since the wizardry in the book took a scientific approach, with formualas and the like, I had a hard time latching onto the storyline. Once the characters got rolling and begin working as wizards and begin their Ordeal, the action picked up and I got me interested. I would not recommend this book for anyone younger than, say, eleven. Not because of subject matter, but because I don't think the attention span would last long enough to survive the slow-paced beginning. If you do really like this book, there are three sequals in which the action is constant and you don't have to drudge your way through explanations."
5,Welcome to the Wizarding World...,"This is the first book in the So You Want to be a Wizard series, and I loved it! Nita Callahan is a normal teenage girl just trying to get by from day to day without getting beat up for her refusal to pick a fight. When a group of bullies chase her into the local library, little does she know her life is about to change forever. Read along as Nita takes the plunge into wizardry, meets Kit Rodregez (also a new wizard), and goes on the ride of her life! I strongly recomend all of the books in this series and can't wait for number eight, Wizards at War! (Coming out in October of 2005)"
4,Great!,"I love So You Want to Be a Wizard. It's yet another interesting spin on a old fantasy standby, the magic-users which are warlocks, wizards, sorcerers, magicians, enchantresses, witches, sorceresses, etc. It's unlike Harry Potter in the way they gain and use magic. Still, there are similarities between the use of magic and other books and old folklore, such as the importance of language, plants such as rowan, and the moon. The characters of Nita and Kit are likeable as bright outcasts, and Nita's family is nicely done, too. The story is very interesting and action-packed, and Nita and Kit do grow a bit during the storyline, mainly in confidence.There are problems with the book which prevent it from getting five stars from me. While Diane Duane's prose is very good, sometimes it's difficult to get into, and her descriptions can be a little overlong. While it's interesting to know how it feels like to do magic, I don't care to hear about it for two pages.I still love it though."
1,Worst Ever,"This was the worst book I have ever read. There is absolutely no comparison to Harry Potter. The story is about a girl who finds a book in the library called "" So You Want to Be a Wizard."" She soon meets another young wizard in training and together they battle some dark forces. I thought this book sounded really good, so I bought it, but this book is boring, and not at all interesting.It is not creative and some parts in the plot are quite predictable. I do not reccommend it."
2,Disappointing,"Unnatural dialogue, forced plot, clumsy writing. A good idea poorly executed. This can't be compared to Harry Potter even a little! Also annoying characters...and the idea that they would risk so much to get back a pen! Ugh...save your money. I can't believe this series has continued for so long."
2,"Sad to say I didn't like this book... I really wanted to, but I just dont!","I bought this book thinking it was similar to the Harry Potter series (in nature and spirit) but I was very wrong. The characters are acceptable, but the author did a poor job of developing the Kit character... Also the writing is exceedingly dull, the story slogs along at an incredibly SLOW pace...Truthfully I found the story boring... but I read it anyway. I will not be reading the rest of the series.I think the writer's biggest mistake is trying to write the ""magic"" as if it were scientifically possible, and she spent way too much time trying to do so... Newsflash! Its MAGIC>>> you know fantasy, you don't need to make it or prove it... fantasy is simply a world that doesn't need explaining or proving.I think someone very young might like this book, but I did not. I am moving on to another series that has better writing."
2,So You Want to be a Wizard - Diane Duane,"Although the book had a good premise, the writing style was distasteful and Diane Duane seemed uneducated in the literary field. Duane's voice came through strongly, which I appreciated, but her voice was too childlike and did not sound authoritative or explanatory at all. Too much of the book was ""filler"" - like she was trying to make the book longer than necessary."
1,bla,"I thought that this book was just kind of boring. The part with the white dwarf star that was hicoughing up all sorts of things was the only funny part, and the rest was just wierd and dumb.Contrary to one of the other reveiwers, the book was so much worse than Harry Potter."
1,AWFUL!!!!!!!!!,"It was a big disapointment! I thought it would be good, but it was boring and confusing. I consider myself a good reader, but this book took me forever to finish! Please trust me and don't waste your money on this horrible book!"
1,not so good,"this book has a good title, it sounded great when I got it. The only thing is most of the plot is about how they got sucked into another world. It starts ok but then cars are trying to kill them, do cars randomly runing around trying to kill people sound like an important plot? I cant beleave she made a sequel."
1,It's no Harry Potter,"If you're looking for something to hold you over until the next book in the Harry Potter series, don't look here. As a writer of fantasy, Diane Duane makes an excellent science fiction author. If you consider sentient marble-sized galaxies, ferocious living helicopters and predatory automobiles the staple for a book about magic and wizardry, then by all means get yourself a copy. Otherwise, check out some of the more traditional fare, like The Magician's Nephew (or the other books in The Chronicles of Narnia series) by C.S. Lewis, or two shining stars by Madeleine L'Engle: A Wrinkle in Time, and Many Waters."
5,"I'm not a kid, but I love this series :)","This is a very enjoyable series. I'm not a kid, but I read a great deal of fantasy fiction, and once in awhile I'll pick up something from the ""teen"" section, like this, and Tamora Pierce's books. Sometimes I'm happily surprised. This series is not dumbed down for children, and has an excellent theme throughout. The kids are put through more than most books would dare to do... having to make decisions that most adults would find difficult.These are classic stories of good against evil... with the twist of the idea that no one is beyond redemption.In this series the wizards travel through dimensions, space and time. An excellent read all around."
5,Great book!,"This is one of my all-time favorite children's books! The first of a series (4 so far) this and the second (Deep Wizardry) are very good. The characters feel like friends--people with problems just like me. I think the conflict between good and evil is very well done. This isn't a cookie-cutter fantasy, although it does have most of the elements. You'll enjoy it! Word of warning: The first 2 are the best, #3 is very good and #4 (in my opinion) just doesn't quite match up."
5,One of my favorites,"If not my favorite book. The plot, characters and writing are all excellent. I would definatly recomend it!"
4,Nita and Kit have quite a lot to do!,"Nita's a smart bookworm that constantly gets in trouble with the school bully's becasue she refuses to fight back. But when she hides out in the school library one day she finds a strange book called ""So you Want to Be a Wizard."" At first she thinks of it as a joke, she has no idea that it will change her life! So when she reads about it she's immeaditallly thrown into her ordeal with Kit, another new wizard. If she succedes she will save the world as we know it, but if she fails... Let's just hope that failing is not an option.This was a good start to Duane's wizardry. I can actually relate to Nita! If you loved reading the tales of Harry Potter you'll love this book!"
4,Very Good Book,I liked this book. It kept me reading at any spare moment I had. It was a page turner and I couldn't predict what would happen next. I would recomend this book to anyone who love adventure/fantasy books.
2,"This book is boring compared to other ""wizard"" books","My two sons ages 8 and 11 have been reading this book and I was pressed into reading it aloud to my younger son for a couple of hours on the plane. I was disappointed. The plot doesn't make a lot of sense after the initial setup that puts the wizarding instruction book in the hands of the protagonist--a ""white hole"" star has a conversation with the kids over a period of days for instance, really just out of nowhere. The kids plunge into doing very sophisticated magic right away and the philosophy of the magic that gets done, if you can call it that, is of the sophmoric ""everything is alive and has feelings"" variety, including rusting cars. I couldn't bear to read it aloud after a while. Skimming it might be ok."
2,Not my type,"If you are an avid reader but not into fantasy, don't read thisbook. I'm a reader who doesn't particularly like fantasy, but I'veread many fantasy books which people have said are very good. Most of those I liked, but not this one. So you want to be a Wizard is good in the first couple chapters, but as the magic gets more intense, I found it hard to follow. My friends who are into fantasy and sci-fi loved this book, so if you are like them, go ahead, read this book. But if you are like me, and want to try a fantasy book, don't read this. I recommend Harry Potter and Ender's Game instead."
3,Unique and for Younger Readers.,"In this book, two young kids find a book called 'So You Want to Be a Wizard'. This dramatically changes both of their lives as they begin to study the magical art.This story has action, humor, and magic. I thought that the story was very unique and interesting, a twist on the Harry Potter series, but at some moments I found that an important piece of action would happen in half a sentence and I had almost missed it. In my opinion, it was a good book for younger and less advanced readers that sometimes lacked detail. Recommended to both boys and girls ages 8-10."
5,An Amazing Start to a Fantastic Series,"Nita and Kit, two thirteen year olds in Manhattan, discover that magic is real and taking place every day, in every corner of the world. This book is packed with magic and action. It is an amazing start to a fantastic series.The beginning of So You Want to Be a Wizard got my attention right away because it reminded me of the opening sequence of The NeverEnding Story. Here, Nita runs into the library to hide from bullies; in TNES, Bastian runs into the bookstore to hide from bullies. The power of books becomes literal in both stories, with Nita embracing magic and The NeverEnding Story encouraging imagination.So You Want to be a Wizard may have come out over twenty years ago, but it is a timeless tale. It is set in our world; however adept they become, the teen wizards still have to go to school, do their homework, and clean their rooms. Descriptive, innovative, and touching, So You Want to Be a Wizard is a book to treasure and to share."
5,Great series,"This is a great book and the series is really good too. You must read them in order. I will warn you though the third one really drags, keep reading it though. The rest of the series is reaaly good. Everyone will love them. I recommend the series to everyone."
3,"Okay, but I've read better","The book began wonderfully. It truely capsered my attention and made me wan to read more. However, half way through the book I guessed the ending. Its an Okay book to do a report on, but not exactly a page-turner. I recomend A wrinkle in time, ella enchanted,his dark marterials, and half-magic if your in to wizard-type books."
3,"Contrived, but intended for kids","If you're target is reads at a middle school leave they'll love it, other wise it will drag on and on. Something not so pleasant for such a short book. The little dance around religion was nice, but they kept undoing their own work. You can't be just misunderstood and utterly evil at the same time. Otherwise a fair read that escapes the Harry Potter genre."
3,So You Want A Good Book?,"This book is OK. It is very long. Depending on the reader, the length can be good or bad. I did not like it because, unlike Harry Potter, it is not very funny and you cannot relate to the characters. The book is very serious and deep. While you're reading it, you'll sometimes go ""What?!"" and have to stop and think about everything. Yes, this book is a fantasy, but that's all it and Harry Potter have in common. If you're looking for a good fantasy book, try the ""Chronicles of Narnia"" or anything by Gail Carson Levine instead."
4,"Great but scary, perhaps a bit too scary.","I love ghouls. When I'm the storyteller, I make sure we have ghouls in our games and I love when players are willing to take on ghouls as characters. Why? They are an interesting combination of vampire and human, a mixture of emotions, and far more powerful that most storytellers and players would like to believe. This book gives you some insights into ghouls though I've seen other passages in other ""world of darkness"" books which should have been included here. I was expecting a read guide to all ghouls you see so that did disappoint me greatly. The pictures are probably some of the scariest in the series and in fact have turned off one really great player from being a ghoul -- very sad because he was so talented and he had such potential as this character. I think another ghoul book perhaps modeled on the ""Children of the Night"" book would be a great aid. Surely there are very powerful and very important ghouls in the world of darkness too."
4,"A drop of blood, and I'm done, right? Not quite!","This is a necessary addition for those game masters that prefer role playing to roll playing. Whenever someone makes a ghoul, they simply make up some stats and a name. There's more to it than that. And this book shows you that there is more to a ghoul than just a weak lackey. Look for Clan differences in ghouls; as well as the introduction of the infamous sireless ghouls. They'll do anything to get just one drop."
2,And...?,"You don't need this book to play ghouls or have them in your game. The book is based on 2nd edition, spends a lot of time talking about how little ghouls know about vamps, etc. Save your money and time by creating basic rules of your own."
3,"They love, they hate you, they are deadly.","Ghouls Fatal Addiction focuses the social interactions between ghouls and their respective domitors (masters), with special consideration of the various clan habits and the roles ghouls can play within and outside of kindred society. Unfortunately some chapters appear twice, first in the subjective view of an ghoul or vampire then described in an objective rules-style. This seems rather odd and makes reading a bit boring.Though the book has many details about the ghouls&#65533; anatomy, it lacks information on the perception of ghouls via disciplines such as Auspex, Thaumaturgy etc. Can you &#65533;see&#65533; only her or ever her domitor? Etc.If you are a vampire, always remind every ghoul, even if she loves you, might be a threat and kill you one day without warning."
1,Give me a break. This teaches almost nothing about Freemasonry.,"Albert Pike was a brilliant scholar. Morals and Dogma is brilliant scholarship which is so esoteric that it's nearly useless. (Exception: Explaining the Scottish Rite doctrine rejecting temporal and religious tyranny in the 30th degree, Knight Kadosh.) Pike writes with unexplained Latin and Greek passages, and strange references to Egyptian mythology. (He later explained that he used Egyptian examples because he figured that wouldn't offend any of the modern religions.)If you're looking to learn about Freemasonry, this ain't the book for you. In fact, no book will tell you very much about Freemasonry. I could write about skydiving, describe the rush of the air into the plane, the hesitation stepping out, the freedom of free-fall, and so forth, but unless I've done it, I have no way to REALLY understand it. If you want to understand it, you really have to go through the experience. To be a Mason, ask a Mason.RC"
3,Who would have thought?,"I bought this book because I have just read the highly recommendable novel 'Journey to Eden' by Max Pucher. It is full of references to Freemasonry and I am astonished that so much of it seems to be true and not just creative invention. 'Morals and Dogma' is quite a surprise. I guess that most see Masonry as purely a charitable concept like me, but that is not all when you read what the founder of the Scottish Rite has to say in here. I wonder how much this is truly related to America's founders.This book is interesting but not a great read, by the way."
1,Morals and Dogma of the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite of Freemasonry,I was disappointed to find out that there are two versions of this book and the one I needed was under the exact title but it is the esoteric version. The two versions are quite different is some stratigic ways.
4,down the Pike!,Every Scottish Rite mason should be required to read this book because it talks about the philosophy of what mason's stand for. It is at times a daunting task due to Pike's writing style but he is nothing less than brilliant which can be overshadowed by his bombast and narcissism. A good read for those of you into history and philosophy but by no means a quick or easy read.
4,great debut,"Aswad will probably be best known for the crossover hit ""Don't Turn Around,"" which was later covered by the Sweedish juggernaut Ace of Base. To me, this is a shame, as the group made a few very credible examples of UK influenced roots reggae before their crossover to more soul/funk based grooves.From 1976, Aswad's debut lp is a great slice of the roots reggae of which I speak. Each track on here, particularly ""Ethiopian Rhapsody,"" and ""Back to Africa,"" which is arguably their best track ever, is a powerful one, and helps to solidify this great lp.While in my opinion, their ""Hulet"" lp is a more desirable one to listen to, there is little doubt that Aswad's debut lp is a very credible effort, and one worth having amongst your UK reggae collection."
5,One of the great dub albums,From the U.K. Aswad shows its musical and vocal chops best on its earlier albums like this one.Later they go way too crossover for me.This is them at their rootsiest during the Marley era.
4,"Good,but not as good as the first book.","I thought this book was great but not as good as ""so you want to be a wizard"".The way undersea things,being a whale and the names were described was pretty cool and so were the caracters but this book did not keep me as enthralled as the last one.In this book Nita is on vacation with her family and her partner Kit.But it soon prooves to not be a very restfull holiday since she gets caught up in the song of the twelve,a reenacment of the time when the lone power came to the sea to bring death to it and Nita is playing the most important part:the silent one,the part of the one who saved the sea and she soon wants to back out for a very good reason(wich I am not going to tell you)but if she does what happened to Atlantis will hapen to New York."
5,"great, i couldn't stop reading!","i only have 10 pages to go, but this is the best book i have ever read. diane dune is a great writer. i recommend all of her books. i started reading at 8:oopm last saterday and didn't stop until it was midnight (which is probably why i only like to read on weekends). it is a mix of real life situations, great magic, and action."
5,Highly Recommendable,"I've only read the first and second books in the series so far, but the second one is the best in my opinion. I got it when I was eleven and have read it so many times that I've worn the corners away. It's been years since I first got it, but I still take it out for an occasional read. The imagery is wonderful and you can really feel the danger. It's much brighter than the first one, which is why I didn't like that one as much. But they're still fantastic books and I'd recommend them to anyone. (---second one's better!---) *lol*"
5,good,love it if you want a good book about wizardry this is it my mom likes it to its good for grown ups too i was in a like state where nothing could break me from it and i play like i am nita some times what she does with the lone power is incredible
3,Great but not that great,This book was well put together but got me really confused. I could not figure out who was who and what was what. Otherwise this book was pretty good.
4,Romance and Laughs Abound!,"I read this book in one day and enjoyed every minute of it. It has the classic ""Beauty and The Beast"" theme which happens to be a favorite of mine. Samantha was a spunky heroine who's quick wit and spunk made her the perfect match for her impatient patient. Gabriel was a hero to be adored. Unlike most ""wounded"" heroes who choose to sulk and mope about - Gabriel's defense was witty sarcasm and a beastly temper. He was a complete ass and I simply adored him!I found myself laughing out loud several times throughout the book and even came close to shedding a tear or two.Highly Recommended!"
3,Good book but went off the deep end...,"It was a wonderful romance story. A beautiful celebration of differences creating love. But, that was the worst ending ever, Samantha's little secret, good lord, does this author have no shame. We were trained through the entire book to hate, despise Cicely. We put our trust in Samantha. It just didn't make any sense. I demand a rewrite. HaHa. All in all it's a good book but it have a weak ending, like maybe she left something cooking on the stove while writing the end and had to finish it fast to squelch the flames..."
5,good book,"I love this book, it kept me entertained all night. (I was up till 4am finishing it) As mentioned before the plot has been used, but trust me it is a great book with a few surprises."
3,I must be the odd one out,"I liked this book, but I didn't love it. The relationship between Gabriel and Samantha was really satisfying until the ridiculous way he regained his sight intruded. Then there was a tangle of misunderstandings and the typical 'I'm not good enough' response from Samantha. As one of the other reviewers said, I too wish that he had made the ultimate declaration before he heard the whole story."
4,Delightful prose and dialogue...,"...but the end was a tad iffy.I'll start by saying Teresa Medeiros is an auto-buy author for me. I've rarely been disappointed in ANY of her work. This novel held me intrigued and played on my emotions up until the last few chapters, when a couple of plot twists took decidedly wrong turns -- in my humble opinion. I did see one of them coming, but another one totally threw me off. : (That said, this is still a great read by a talented writer. Characterization, prose, and dialogue are classic Medeiros. Her handling of a blind hero was exceptional."
3,Was on its way to a better review...,"...but TM disappointed me in the end. Up until then I was loving the story, even though I figured out the ""twist"" very early on. I won't spoil the story, but suffice it to say that Gabriel does something toward the end that makes a mockery of his love for Samantha, and I was so distraught that I nearly couldn't finish it. So, five stars for most of the book, one star for the last part, and I went with the average. ""Charming the Prince"" is a much more satisfying read by this author."
2,Disclaimer - I didn't read the whole book.... because,"I could not get past the basic premise. A wealthy, distinguished war hero living in Regency England needs help coping with his blindness and they hire an inexperienced young woman to take care of him? Because there were no experienced, medically-trained veterans with experience dealing with war wounded to take care of him? So that's where I stopped reading."
2,PLOT TWIST RUINED BOOK!!!,At the very beginning I found Samantha annoying but she grew out of it after a few chapters. Then the book became so good until near the end where the plot twist took place. I did not see it coming. The book did not make sense after finishing the book. I felt like I was tricked. Spoiler alert - how could Samantha be Cecily? There were no clues and it was like I was looking at two different people. It did not make sense. Samantha never acted like she knew Gabriel. It was all business. I am just really upset because the book was so good and had to be ruined by the plot twist. I felt she only cared about herself. He was looking all over for her and she continued to trick her. I will never read another book by this author again. She ruined a perfectly good book.
3,meh..,it was just ok. now i don;t even remember how it ended so i guess i could not finish this book.the writing needs a little more work.
3,Can't believe how high these reviews are...,I guess I'm another odd one out because I thought the book was o.k. but I wouldn't read it again. I certainly didn't love it & I'm not really sure I can even say that I actually liked it. This is the 2nd book I've read from Teresa Medeiros & I will read more because the book Nobody's Darling was excellent. Along with the romance in books I also enjoy a little mystery & suspense & there just wasn't any in this book. It was just a little too slow to me & there wasn't much excitement. If a nice slow romance without any adventure is what you enjoy then certainly give it a try but if you want more then just a plan slow romance then find another read.
4,Sweet romance,This was my first read my Teresa Medeiros and it won't be my last. I enjoyed the character development - Gabriel was a great tortured hero. This one had a plot twist that totally surprised me.
4,The writer of Publishers Review must have been Asleep...,"This is a wonderful book. The ending caught me quite unawares. As with most of Ms. Medeiros' books, the characters are real and likeable, one in which the reader can lose himself or herself in the plot and settings and character dialogue. I lOVED it, and have bought copies to give to my friends!"
4,Twist!,"Very, very good! There was a twist I never saw coming, but the ending left me a little bit unsatisfied.I'll definitely check more of Teresa Medeiros' books out."
2,I did not like the girl's cowardice & cruelty,"I have two problems with this book. First it is a typical formulaic romance novel. It has all the predictable plot, action and characters. There is a nice surprise twist to the end, but there is nothing special, creative or delighting throughout the book. I almost feel like it was written by a computer with all the proper ingredients. My second problem is with the girl. Although the author described the girl as a coward, I found the girl's actions to be cruel. I couldn't get past the hurts she caused Gabriel. When she first saw him in the hospital, she ran away. After they found love together, she ran away again. He suffered and searched for her for months. Finally he gave up the search and decided to rejoin the Navy. She let him suffer far too long before she was willing to tell him the truth. This cruelty overshadowed the rest of the story for me."
1,this book could be a lot better.,"This book did not interest me one bit. I thought this book did not have a plot. The book's setting was back in the 1800's and i do not like those types of books. Thos book is a book your history teacher would hand out to read. In this book the action wasn't the greatest. I like books that the action is hair pulling, and stomach turning. I would reccomend this book to a person who likes books set in the old times, and or to a person who does not like to read because there are only 116 pages in the story but the words are double spaced."
1,A Real Snoozer,"If you want to waste the time just borrow a friends copy but DON'T waste the money buying this novel yourself. I read another of Lance's books entitled ""A Byte of Charity"" and was hooked from the first chapter. However, ""Reel Pressure"" starts off really slow, picks up in the middle, and has an ending that seems to drag on forever leaving me with no feelings of satisfaction once I was finished. I don't know if that's his way of getting me to buy his next book but it didn't work."
4,It dose what it needs to,"The product dose what it needs to and is easy to install. On my Chinese sks it does however make it next to impossible to get the cleaning kit in and out because the holes don't line up 100%. If you use this, plan on either using another cleaning method and just storing the kit in the butt so you won't loose it or else store the kit someplace else rather then deal with trying to wrestle it in and out all the time."
5,One of a kind,"Incredible playing by Brown, Rollins and Roach... the tracks are mostly up-tempo but it keeps you listening. Definatly a 5 star record that shows the incredible originality and talent of these musicians in their prime. Humerous and just plain good improv, this is a must have for any bop lover."
4,"NOT A LIVE RECORDING, Amazon peeps!!!","The Amazon bozos once again didn't do their homework and listed this as a live recording, which it isn't.I REPEAT, THIS IS NOT A LIVE RECORDING. It's a studio recording, and an excellent date at that...also, enter Sonny Rollins.This is an excellent record, although I'd rate their first eponymous collaboration together as the better of the two."
5,Better Than Miles,"This CD is the best Jazz CD I have ever heard. This recording combines the amazing technique and passion of one of the best jazz quintets of all time. This CD offers amazing solos and beautiful and powerful melodies. Through listening to this CD, one will be astounded at the powerful sound, amazing range, and the overall fabulous music that Clifford Brown produced. Also featured in this CD is a young but still magnificent Sonny Rollins, a late addition to the band. This CD is one of the quintet's last recordings before Clifford Brown and Richard Powell's tragic deaths. This CD is a must have for anybody who likes music... Buy this CD!"
4,Not complete - focus is on Max not Clifford,"For the life of me I do not know why this album was issued with a little over half of the tracks of the original (which is available under the same name here:Clifford Brown and Max Roach at Basin Street.) Perhaps the focus on Max Roach accounts for it.Other than the omission of what I consider to be important tracks I agree with the accolades heaped by other reviews. Also, what makes this album (especially the complete one linked above) important is it was the last one before Clifford's untimely death (and Richie Powell's who was in the car with Clifford).Also, including Sonny Rollins only adds to the historical and musical value.I encourage you to consider the complete album instead of this one, and if you are compiling a collection of Clifford Brown albums, to also considerFour Classic Albums (Brown and Roach Inc. / Jam Session / Study in Brown / New Star on the Horizon)."
2,culturally interesting,"I found this novel fairly non-compelling. It was hard to even get through the first quarter, and I was two thirds through before it became very interesting. If I wasn't obligated to read it for my book club, I would have stopped long before I finished. I learned a little about Indian culture and history, but not much. There are too many other books out there to bother with this one."
2,Attention Writers,"There is such a need for historical fiction on Asia, and this book doesn't entertain the reader."
4,Good Read,"In the past two decades there have been some wonderful novels written by Indian authors, but none of them were based/set against the background of Tamil Nadu's history. Vikram Seth's tome, ""A Suitable Boy,"" was set against the backdrop of Delhi and Uttar Pradesh, while Arundati Roy's ""God of Small Things,"" was set in Kerala.Publisher turned writer David Davidar's book ""The House of Blue Mangoes,"" nicely fills that lacuna. Davidar deftly weaves South history and culture into the narrative that is set in the fictional town of Chevathar located in the southern most tip of India.The novel chronicles the tragedies and triumphs of the powerful Dorai family: Solomon, Daniel, Aaron and Kannan. The panoramic story begins in the close of the 19th century and ends in 1947 when Indian became independent.Davidar's skill as a storyteller is evident and the novel makes for an absorbing read. Also his interest and keen eye for research is reflected in this historical novel."
2,wannabe,"Mr Davidar thought he was writing the great Indian novel. Unfortunately, what came out at the end was a schoolboy effort, characterized by Raj cliches, prose that sounds like it is translated, and occasional paragraphs containing personal views on India and Indians which dont mesh with the main text at all. I am glad I borrowed this free of cost from the library and did not waste my money - though I did waste my time reading it. All I can say is that it would make good reading on a long flight - at least the story has tempo and keeps you mildly entertained."
2,It feeds the Western stereotypes of India,This is another novel in the genre of the Macaulayite Indian trying his/her best to describe India to the West. The problem is that the synthesis is wanting because the author's understanding is based on stereotypes that muddle where a straighter look would have shown reality for what it is.
1,Cliche characters and the kitchen sink,"David Davidar has apparently never heard of the saying ""less is more."" His book has every cliche that you can connect with India -- the caste system, extended families, wretched poverty, etc, etc. Of course, all these exist, but they should be included in a book only if they further the story. Perhaps that is just the problem. Davidar has a hard time getting a believable story together.Stick to publishing, Davy baby! Leave writing to those who have the talent."
5,the best!,"i am almost shocked to see that nobody have seemingly read and rated this unique book. have had a bad back all my life, unable to even practice Chi Kung without hurting it! at the first try of this simple routine of back stretching, i feel young again: 30 years less in matter of back ease and confort! Try it!"
3,Destined to be Ingested,"I thought this was a pretty unique Zombie film, with some Hot chicks, good laughs and a story thats different then anything ive ever seen before, also some really cool zombies, i would reccomend this to any horror fan."
3,A bit contemporary,I was dissapointed a bit. Everything sounds great and still it does not excite me
5,Stellar jazz from Merrill,"This is a classic jazz album, not just vocal jazz. Her voice is so stylish and full. Clifford knows what he's doing so nothing need be said about his playing. Get these tracks!"
3,Its a OVA,"This is a OVA so the storyline is not really stable at all. Its a good anime something to pick up if you collect it like me. But there is alot of nudity due to her transformations and the really graphic ep 1 that tells of the beginning. It has 6 episodes, if I knew that this was a OVA then I would have waited to pick this one up last."
1,LAME!!,"By far one of the worst animes ever! Minimal story line, old school animation, and unnecessary skankiness in the first part of the series."
4,Move Over Buffy... Yohko's In Town,This was one of the first Anime VHS tapes I ever bought back in the early 90's and I was delighted to see it transferred to DVD and preserved for the next generation of Anime fans. The art and animation still hold up today and is done by hand and not by computers like so much garbage anime today. The story is fun as we follow the foot steps of our uncertain heroine on her way to becoming the baddest demon slayer in all of Japan. Good music accents a fun Buffy the Vampire Slayerish storyline with good voice acting on the Japanese part (English no reviewed). Well worth a watch and a keeper for any fan's collection.
2,a little too absent minded,ok anime but was a little too absent minded with a Buffy the vampire style plot. the anime was also full of some mindless nudity that made this show a little more immature for adults. Not my best recommendation.
2,Not for kindle!!!,"After reading the two previous reviews I bought the kindle edition of this book. The first review for the paperback edition says that there are a lot of commentaries and clarifications; the second review for the kindle edition is more a lesson on Aristotle than a review of this book, but gives 5 stars. But notice that the kindle edition has ONLY the translation: no notes, no comments. In the description of the book there is no mention that the kindle version differs from the paper version, while this should be explicitely stated. Moreover, there are no active links in the table of contents. I give 2 stars (instead of one) only because I respect the work of the two translators, but Amazon should separate the evalutions of printed books and of kindle books, otherwise the average star rating has no meaning."
4,ARISTOTLE,"GREAT REFERENCE WORK. MANY MORE SUCH REFERENCE BOOKS SHOULD BE MADE AVAILABLE FOR HIGH SCHOOL, COLLEGE, AND UNIVERSITY POST GRADUATE STUDENTS."
1,Boring!,"This book is so boring I can't even bring myself to finish it. I'm halfway through, and so far, all it talks about is the right side of the brain and left side of the brain and how they control your behavior and whether you are an intro or extrovert. Nothing about children, hidden gifts, dealing with an introverted child, bringing out the best in them, etc. - which is what I expected when I purchased the book. Honestly, not worth wasting your time reading it."
2,Some good points but didn't care for it,"I like the point made that non-pure bred dogs are wonderful and worth saving. However some of the ""catalogue"" of mixes was ridiculous. Example: comments on ""chow-sharpei"" mix and ""chow"" mixes was obviously due to the fact that the author does not like either breed. I have a chow/samoyed mix who is absolutely wonderful - got the best of both breeds. It would have been more fair to catalogue as well the good points of the breed and perhaps explain more as to why certain breeds can have negative points (poor breeding, socialization & training for example)."
2,I was looking for photographs of mixed breeds...,"A somewhat interesting book if you do not know anything about mixed breed dogs. I do, and was looking for a book which had more photographs of mixed breed dogs, identified by their ""parentage."" I also know about animal cruelty, and was shocked to find on page 102, in the sidebar, a story about a Confederate soldier who was due to be executed and whose last request to Union soldiers -- that he be allowed to say goodbye to his dog -- was not only denied, but as the Confederate soldier was led away, his dog was beaten to death by the Union soldiers ""with their rifle butts."" I did not expect to find this sort of material in such a book, and wish I had never read it. The story is supposed to illustrate how the soldier was saved by ""seeing"" the dog's ghost, but it left me wishing I hadn't known about it."
2,Not Brownie's best ballad work,"Clifford Brown was one of the great ballad masters on his instrument. There is ample evidence of this across his recorded work. This collection is not a good sampling of it. Of the 14 tracks, five are from the ""Clifford Brown With Strings"" session that was marred with Neal Hefti's schmaltzy, dated arrangements and not much improvisation by Brownie. Another six are showcases for singers Helen Merrill, Sarah Vaughan and Dinah Washington. One, the wonderful minor blues ""Lands End"" is not a ballad. That leaves just two, ""Ghost of a Chance"" (nice) and ""Time"" (questionable). Unless you want the female vocals and Neal Hefti, this set is not for you."
4,Decent collection of ballads,"Those wishing for a quick sampler of Brownie's ballad play from across his career will enjoy this collection. Although it is by no means complete, and some of Brown's great performances are missing (for instance, ""Delilah"" would have fit here even better than ""Land's End""), this CD is nice."
4,WHY is each song faded out???,"I had the double LP back in the 80s, and am glad to have the entire concert--but then again, I don't. Every SINGLE song is faded out, and the next song is faded in. What earthly purpose does this serve? To make the selections more radio-friendly for DJs? Are you kidding me? It completely ruins the ""you'll feel like you were there"" vibe and yanks you out of of the concert every 3 minutes or so. Not only that, but the next song doesn't immediately fade in--there's like a 3 or 4-second gap. After I track down who remastered this and congratulate him, I'll ask him who engineered it, so I can go egg his house. Colossally bad call, dude."
5,Wonderful fresh,"I saw Dolmen music performed many many years ago at LaMama in NYC. I have owned the vinyl record for about as many years and I love this music. Great to listen at night with the lights out, or on the porch watching lightening bugs dance. I have listened to Dolman music more than to the other side but I am a fan of Meredith Monk also owning Key and having listened to Turtle Dreams a lot which I have on cassette tape--would like to have both of these on CD now. This is really worth adding to your collection when you are tired of all the usual stuff and want to hear with fresh ears. I think this is surely one of Meredith's best albums."
3,So BAD So Good Action a la Hong Kong Movie,"Watching ""Simon Sez"" is like reading a trashy comic book; like a Jean-Claude Van Damme movie, you never think seriously about its plot or characters at all. You just enjoy the series of set-pieces such as not-so-bad action scenes with awful lines, and too obvious comic relief that is not as funny as moviemakers intended. Dennis Rodman always looks like Dennis Rodman, but if so, who cares?Actually, thanks to the participation of Xin Xin Xiong (as action director and second unit stunt coordinator) from Hong Kong, action scenes are better than average. Xin Xin Xiong himself appears as a bodyguard, and displays his superb martial arts skills, but, you know, Rodman is no Jet Li (with whom Xiong collaborated during Ji's Hong Kong era). If you are a fan of Hong Kong action films, you might find ""Simon Sez"" more than passable. If you are not, well, give only one star and forget about it."
2,Simon Sez Review,"While the film can be funny sometimes and it does have some decent action scenes. Dennis Rodman was okay in this film. Not great but pretty good. The plot is soo stupid as wacthing a John Cena match. The Cyber Monks & Dane Cook are soo annoying,you wish they were in a Final Destination film so they can get kill off right away. Overall,it's ok if you are a Dennis Rodman fan. I give this film a 4 out of 10."
1,NO SERVICE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,ORDERED BEFORE JULY 4TH.STILL NOT RECEIVEDEMAILS NEVER ANSWEREDNO CREDIT GIVENI JUST WANT THE 2 DVD'S I ORDERED
5,"An Excellent Film Noir, Full of Suprises","""The Proposal"" is an intelligent, first-rate undercover police story with a lot of twists and turns that you can never see coming. The Director has a real knack for building tension and suspense... it keeps increasing as the story progresses, and the mystery deepens as it unfolds. Jennifer Esposito really proves that she can play the leading role in a feature... she's radiant, and Nick Moran (from ""Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels"") plays the nervous, paranoid undercover cop to perfection. Stephen Lang (Tombstone) is awesome as the subtly psychotic Crime lord, and it's nice to see William B. Davis (X-files' Smoking Man) play an FBI agent who DOESN'T smoke! Very clever, unpredictable, good looking film noir. Highly recommended."
4,No VGA or DVI Connections.,I like the Expansion Base with one exception. I use it for work and I have a flat panel to go along with the laptop to double my viewing size. You have to plug the DVI or VGA cable into the laptop and not the Expansion Base. The Expansion Base only has a S-Video connection on it. Other then that it is a great product.
1,Who built this thing? And who decided to call it a docking station?,OK...so first of all does not come with its own power supply so you have to buy an extra in order to be quick and convenient. I am looking for a way to hook up my larger hp lcd monitor to it...cant do it. Only hooks up to a TV. You have to do that using your laptop. Then I want to plug in my laptop...you have to use a cord that does not easily come out of its hiding place...Totally defeats the purpose of having a docking station. This is supposed to be a quick and easy way to turn your laptop into a desktop. So really my question is what purpose does this thing serve? I paid 200 dollars for a freaking stand and lame speakers. Next time I will know better and go with Dell.
1,Cumbersome,"This base station is a waste of money. It's just too cumbersome to hook up the laptop, especially if you want to use an external monitor, for example. I'm sure I'll forget to unplug the monitor from the laptop (yes, laptop - it's not connected to the base!) and destroy the laptop or the monitor in the process.This gizmo weighs a ton - I assume it's the speakers!? The design of this thing makes it close to unusable.Avoid - save your money."
1,HP XB 2000 was a catastrophe!!!!,"I bought this for my son, who has a disability and uses a laptop with voice recognition software. Voice recognition software files are huge, and we thought the 250 gig hard drive would be a real good thing to have to back them up. Well, evidently, the XB 2000 is not compatible with the voice recognition software. As soon as he installed the base, his VRS crashed, and we haven't been able to recover it. HP phone support quite simply BITES! All the tech could tell me to do in his English-as-a-second-language accent was to run system restore, then blame the software. So now my son has lost ALL his voice user files, just in time for his first semester at college. Angry doesn't even begin to describe how I feel about this, but was glad to find out how crappy the support is before we bought another laptop from HP for the next kid."
5,Great view!!!!!,"I'm pleased with my expansion base, it allows me the flexibility to adjust the view of my screen while I'm working and the automatic plus is the ability to use the keyboard for typing instead of my laptop keys which are smaller."
1,Contractual Obligation Album: ZZZZZZZZZZZZZ,"Midnight Oil was a great live act but The Real Thing is little more than filler and if you gave these guys truth serum, they'd probably admit it.With an album like this, they made it easy for their record company to ignore them. When they finally made a near great ablum - Capricornia - nobody cared. They were down to their last six fans in the states. I was one of themTry Scream in Blue -- which shows them at their pulverizing best."
4,Reminiscent of a book by Shel Silverstein,"I originally purchased this book for my neices because of the colorful illustrations, however, I ended up getting a copy for myself after I read the book. The book reminds me of 'The Giving Tree' by Shel Silverstein. I loved that book as a child and keep it on my bookshelf today. As with 'The Giving Tree', there's a moral behind the story of Maxime and Ariel's adventure with the 'whale with a polka-dot tail.' It seems to me that the author is conveying that while we may all have the inevitable 'grass is greener' syndrome, we have plenty to be content with. Our family and friends are the true source of happiness! Now that's refreshing!"
5,WoW!,This book had a great meaning and message to give to readers of all ages. During this tragic state of our nation this book is a must have.
5,Very funny book,I originally stumbled across this book in a little bookstore. I thought it was hilarious and knew a friend who would appreciate reading it.
4,Humorous gift for cat lovers,"The book not exactly chicken soup for the soul for cats but it's a great gift for cat lovers. I'd also recommend the book for reading material in an English as a Second language class. The pages are filled with interesting characters, adjectives and adverbs to discuss. However, this book is not suitable for small children as there are several references to sex and murder."
2,A flawed perspective,"I think the author has a flawed perspective with cats. While some of the entries in this collection were slightly amusing, most portray kitties as vain, decadant and self absorbed, with few redeeming qualities. This was not the fun read I had hoped it would be."
4,Awesome plot!,Hasselhoff has a dream sequence that stages the plot for one of the intelligent scripts I have ever seen. END
1,fantasy,This is a completely unrealistic book that doesn't seem to grasp why the first world IS the first world.
2,"Weak, Weak, Weak...","I'm a strong coffee drinker and thought to myself that a French Roast is a bold coffee. Well, I didn't find this to be very ""bold"" so I can't rate it well according to my taste for coffee.If you like strong coffee like we do - consider these:1. Timothy's Midnight Magic --> BY FAR my favorite!2. Green Mountain Dark Magic3. Emeril's Extra BoldThat being said, some people don't like the strong taste of coffee so take my advice only if you are a strong coffee drinker."
5,Great Low Profile 1394 FireWire PCI Card,"Quick and easy installation. Windows XP Pro automatically detects and installs the required driver. Included in the package: 3/4"" low profile bracket card, 3-ft 1394 cable and VideoStudio 8 DVD software. This card will only work in a low profile desktop, so if you have a standard or full size case, please look into other card."
5,Works prefect for transfering off my Sony miniDV Handycam,I wasn't sure anything was going to work. I couldn't stream over USB and when i plugged my DCR-HC42 handycam it showed no signs of life.I powered down then plugged this is a regular PCI slot(it has a full size bracket if needed) and restarted.I plugged the supplied cable from my handycam dock into the card and BAM..streaming video in Adobe Premiere(30 day trial).I haven't tried the supplied software but so far with Premiere I've copied about 10 vids.Now if I could just figure out how to lower the file size(avi files)..it seems like 5 minutes of video is 1 gig+(this is standard def).5 stars..works perfect..I also connected one of my Maxtor OneTouch externals just for fun.Not sure if it's running faster than USB 2 though.Installed in a Dell slim 537s.Install time start to finish-less than 5 minutes
3,Not For 64 bit computer,"Someone said this worked with Windows 7 so I bought it. I should have researched whether this worked for a 64 bit computer. It does not fit in the slot in the computer; however, I had a 32 bit computer and it installed it on that one. Works fine there."
3,Conspicuously contemplative,"Definitely leaning more towards a minimalist folk influence, Metheny offers six contemplative strummers which go a long way on providing light, classy atmosphere, but leaves digging into substantial composition a thing to be desired."
4,Mellow Metheny,"A very mellow, enjoyable Metheny offering. Something I like to listen to on a Saturday morning, with my coffee and paper or play while I'm driving. It's essentially Pat by himself, acoustic and electric guitar and bass that he layers over each other. It's very melodic and a bit sparse if you're used to him having Lyle Mays and a full band backing him up. ""New Chatuaqua"" and ""Sueno Con Mexico"" are two of my absolute favourites.I think that non-Metheny fans would enjoy this album."
5,Great American Road Music,"Metheny's an innovator and has been all over the map over his long career in terms of styles, moods, textures, and sounds.Here we have an early effort in which he takes his guitar and overdubs an introspective, wide-open-spaces musical journey across America, weaving in jazz, folk, country, rock, mountain music, and everything in between. If you love his work on Joni Mitchell's Amelia (performed live on Shadows and Light), you'll love the sound of this record.The mood is mellow but not dull, quiet but not silent, and the results are spectacular. This is the cd to take with you on a trip across the western frontier, or a short hop to Burger King. Works either way."
3,A political tragedy,"Sean Penn plays the part of a man who is elected governor of the state of Louisiana by promising poor people food, roads, schools, and other things they have been denied by crooked politicians. Unfortunately, once he gets into office he becomes the most crooked politician of them all. Jude Law is the reporter who watches him become governor and then joins his staff, becoming a part of the fraud and corruption. This movie has terrific potential and combines a brilliant novel and a stellar cast, but unfortunately it misses the mark by having a script which plays the same note throughout. There is an inexorable march towards a tragic end. There is no comic relief, no change of tone, only a steady drumroll toward disaster. There is an emotional sameness to it throughout the film which keeps it from becoming the outstanding movie which its makers intended it to be."
2,Broken Case,Movie was good but the handling of it during shipment leaves a lot to be desired. The case was broken during shipment and the DVD was sliding around inside when I received it. The movie began to skip about half way through it due to the scratches. Not sure if I would risk ordering another.
2,Overpenned and outlawed,"I think the responsibility for this failure lies with mainly 3 people.First of all, Sean Penn, whom I respect as a great actor (e.g. Mystic River, 21 Grams), but not in this terrible performance. His portrait of a populist demagogue is just too much over the top towards a caricature of Chaplin's great dictator.Second, the script writer. It can not be that easy to foul up an essentially good story so badly. There is no narrative drive.Third, this must be Jude Law's worst film ever. He is not an obvious miscast, one can initially believe his character, the young man from an elite background and his mutual attraction with the vulgar politician. But in the course of the plot, the motivation of his character loses ground, and Law is at a loss for adequate facial expressions. He makes a mess of it.Hopkins and Winslet are doing fine, but why are 3 English actors needed for a Louisiana story?"
2,Not Great,"It was an ok movie, but i would not watch it again. With the actors in this movie, i exspected better."
1,BORING,I saw this at my sister's house she tends to buy DVDs she has never seen before just because she likes the actors but after she & I watch this she wished she had not bought it. It was boring.
1,One Of The WORST Films I have Ever Seen!!!,"I cannot believe that there are actually reviewers who actually Liked this film! This Film was a Mammoth FAILURE on ALL LEVELS! The Script was terrible, there was really no story whatsoever and it just didnt make sense! Sean Penn To me is the greatest actor of our generation but this was his WORST PERFORMANCE! Sean's Southern accent was SO BAD that I had to actually turn on the English Subtitles to understand him. This Movie just didnt make sense and was full of holes that were never filled or explained by the movies end(and I CLAPPED when the film FINALLY ENDED)! The Only Good Performances were by James Gandolfini who was very Convincing(made me totally forget Tony Soprano) and patricia clarkson ws Good! Do Not waste Two Hours of your life watching this garbage! Go Buy The Original Version which is a Classic and Far Superior!"
2,Not worth watching,"I only rented the movie on Blu-ray...didn't buy it. I'm thankful for that. I fell asleep during the movie (doesn't happen very often for me). Sean Penn was very annoying, and there weren't any impressive features on the disk. Don't waste your money."
4,A great movie,"I really liked this movie and I actually saw it before I read the book. Of course the book is better, but this is definitely worth the buy if you like dramas and political dramas at that. The entire cast gave great performances and brought the book to life. I really enjoyed this movie and glad I own it."
3,"""Prince, not King""","2 stars below the original A>T>K>M with Broderick Crawford. Sean Penn ""ain't no Broderick Crawford. This flick is fair entertainmnt, the original,(still available on Amazon) provides great entertainment. Ihave both films, I'll keep the Crawford and throw away the Penn."
1,"Weak Story, an All Star Cast, a real waste of time.","With the all star lineup this movie had, I would've thought that they could be better utilized than a story on the Gov. of Lousiana. This could have been a really good gangster flick - all the people were avaialable. Sean Penn instead of all his hand waving and droning on and on about something I really could not follow, could have put his skills onto something better. This movie is a complete waste of talent, money - you name it."
2,"Wherefor art thou, Oscar?","Should get some sort of Razzie award for the worst set of Southern accents by an entire cast since ""Hurry Sundown"". Unfortunately though, this film lacks the campy awfulness of that film and substitutes pompous awfulness instead. Watching James Gandofini struggle with his accent does at least have some comic appeal. This film certainly has one of the finer casts put together in some time, but the sum of the parts is far greater than the whole, sort of 12 actors in search of an Oscar. This is indeed Shakespearean in the sense that it is a ""tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, and signifying nothing"", amply illustrated in the final image of the blood of Willy Stark and his killer slowly running through the grooves in the Seal of Louisiana embedded in the floor only to run together."
2,"Slow, boring, this movie sucked.....","To bad this movie really sucked, what a great cast. Penn is a great actor when the movie is good. If you are really aching for something to do, then rent this, please do not but it, you will be mad.Philip. TCBRN 1-3-07. Simpsonville, SC."
1,Miscast and Misguided,"Director Steven Zaillian's clueless adaptation of Robert Penn Warren's classic novel sat on the shelf for nearly a year - and it should have stayed there. Fatal miscasting abounds, with Sean Penn giving an appallingly bad performance as political demagogue Willie Stark. Avoid at any cost!"
3,ONLY IN LOUISIANA,"This is a very interesting movie, with some very good performances, but it's very uneven and Penn gets the Faye Dunaway award for some serious overacting, I mean what is with all of the hand gestures and the walk, really you have to love Penn, he gives every part his all. Personally, I like the Jude Law voice over and I thought his story in particular was very interesting. I liked the fact that the movie was obviously filmed on location in Louisiana, it gave it a feel of authenticity. I found it also interesting, the choice to set the film in the 50's, long after Long's actual death in the thirties. I appreciated the filmakers attention to detail in the clothing and styles of the 50's. All and all, not a bad film and one I'd recommend, but be forewarned, Penn does do some seriously scene chewing."
1,Bored,"Just one word - ""Bored""! I watched the whole movie and eager to see the end credits! Hardly imagine Hopkins & Penn would involve in such a lame movie!"
2,Hopelessly pretentious and muddled filmisation of the famous 1946 novel,"""All the King's Men"" is a pointless filmisation of Robert Penn Warren's 1946 novel, which had already been brought to the screen to great effect by Robert Rossen in 1949 - THAT version garnered a Best Picture Oscar.The story of a Louisiana Governor (played by Sean Penn) who will stop at nothing to maintain power is pretty tame by today's standards.The script and direction by writer/director Steven Zaillian are hopelessly muddled and pretentious - even the big, emotional moments fizzle. Overlong and overwrought - an excellent cast is wasted."
1,Longalike Bore,"A lot of hype surrounded the opening of this film in Louisiana, as it was both filmed and set here (even though Robert Penn Warren's book wasn't set in any particular state). The story, of course, parallels the political life of Louisiana's ""Kingfish"", Huey Long. Just in case we couldn't figure that out, Longalike populist Willie Stark sings Long's theme song ""Every Man a King"", and the final scene plays out on the bronze map of Louisiana that's set in the floor of the State Capitol. Louisiana history notwithstanding, the movie is a dreadful bore, almost all shot in half-light, and mused rather than spoken by the actors other than Sean Penn, who senses the great overacting possibilities inherent in playing Stark. Some here in Louisiana said that the style was true to Warren's downbeat book Others, including a Warren scholar and my 13-year old daughter, shared my opinion."
1,Miscasting totally destroyed this film,"Anthony Hopkins, Kate Winslet, Jude Law, James 'Mush-Mouth' Gandolfini and Mark Ruffalo ??????? How about casting an actual Southerner for a story that takes place IN THE SOUTH!!!Not one of the actors I mention is believable in their role andthe movie is a bust. Big Time!"
3,Penn and company save the film,"this remake of the 1949 film is not as good as that version,but it'sstill watchable,particularly for the performance of Sean Penn.hetranscends the material.watching him here,i can't help but think he maybe the greatest living actor of his generation,at the very least.JackieEarle Haley(whom i had heard a lot of good things about but had never seenbefore)is also exceptional in a small role,as is Patricia Clarkson.therest of the supporting cast are also good.really all of the actors arebetter than the movie they are in.this is really an actor's film.thefilm itself tends to drag and be long winded and veer off track,losingmomentum which it never fully gains.if it weren't for Penn's bravuraperformance,this would likely be a skippable movie.but he(and byextension,the rest of the cast)salvages the film.for me,All the King'sMen (2006) is a 3/5"
1,Hard Core Opera Style,I was expecting more of a classical music style. I gave this as a early Christmas gift for my mom and no one in the house could stand to have it on at all. A BIG Fail:o(
4,Life of a governess,"This is a very easy read and I'm glad to say I enjoyed it. I thought I would be irritated by the narrator's ""goody-two-shoes"" character, but it was not as bad as I expected. It's also very light reading, so overall quite a satisfying experience. I suppose the sweet love story accounted for most of the four star rating!In general, it reads as though Agnes never grew or developed during the course of the book. However, I think that's probably because the story is told through the voice of an older Agnes, kind of as a recollection of events."
4,The forgotten Bronte sister,"I read this book because I had read ""Wuthering Heights"" and ""Jane Eyre"" and I wondered what the story was with Anne Bronte, the other novelist Bronte sister. ""Agnes Grey"" is very different from the books Anne's sisters wrote. It's lighter and downright funny in parts. Like the other Bronte sisters' books, it features bratty charges of a governess (there are a lot of bratty cousins in Bronte books--I wonder who it was who inspired all those characters). But Agnes herself comes off as a little bit entitled, which winds up being quite funny. ""Agnes Grey"" reminds me more of a Jane Austen book than of a Bronte book. If you're a fan of the Bronte's, you should read this book just from a completist standpoint. But even if you're just a fan of the literature of the period, this is a pretty fun read."
5,perfect,"The book with a perfect starting and a happy end.The language of the book is simply wonderful,but the charecter of Agnes's mother and sister deserve some more space in the book .There is so little about them in the whole book but they dominate the story,without them the story is never be told."
2,Oh ! So slow!,I had hopes for this as I love Charlotte & Emily Bronte's famousnovels but sadly this one is by Ann dreadfully slow and predictable. Ifound myself desperate for something to actually happen or for a glimmerof humour.
4,The ending brought it up one star,"I must admit that this book was quite boring at times and I kept asking why this was a classic. The story did not go in-depth enough, but, I kept with it, and found it pleasing enough in the last two-thirds of it. This is the second book I've read of the Bronte sisters, ""Jane Eyre"" being the first one (which was amazing and my favorite of all the classics). But this one I will remember fondly, and I am thankful it wasn't any longer, because I may have lost patience with it. The ending is what saved it from a three star vote, when Agnes was able to see some of the comeuppance with her silly students, and become the wife of the man she fancied. I own ""The Tenant of Wildfell Hall"" so I will give it a try, which is said to be better than this one."
4,Delightful,This was an easy and delightful read. A pleasant change from some of the current books being written today. A lot of what is being printed today is pretty trashy.
4,Agnes Grey,"A good read - though modern readers might find it pious and simplistic, I found it quite charming and easy to read and engage with."
4,Brontes Rock!,I love the Bronte sisters. You cant beat the price of these free books either. If you're looking for a good read with some underlying commentary of the society in which the author lived (with some feminism mixed in) these are a good option!
2,Nothing surprising or worthwhile,"Not all that interesting, esp if you have read a lot in this genre. This Bronte book is the closest of all the Bronte novels to a Jane Austen type of story. It isn't tragic, it plods along, lots of dialogue. It is obvious from the beginning what is going to happen at each turn--unhappy marriage for money, an ill-treated governess who slooooowly falls for a clergyman, etc. Very formulaic."
4,Goodness Gracious Agnes,"A pretty little Victorian novel by Anne Bronte. Not nearly as good as `The Tenant of Wildfell Hall' but still charming and fun. The portrait of Agnes as an innocent but good and charitable governess is well drawn. However her `goodness' gets a bit tiring toward the end. You begin wishing she would stand up for herself, but I guess that wouldn't be acceptable Victorian behaviour. Of course as a governess she meets tyrannical children, stupid egoistic employers, silly gentry, but she also describes the peasants of the time and compares `good' and `vain' preachers. In the end goodness is rewarded and greed is taught a nice lesson. Worth reading if only to compare to `The Tenant' and better known works by the other Bronte sisters."
1,Unscientific and under-researched,"I found this book to be of little to no value.The author neglects to mention uses of several of the plants in her book. For example, the author makes no mention of using burdock or Queen Anne's lace for there roots. The roots of burdock are a delicacy in Japan.Additionally,wood sorrel should come with a warning to avoid consuming large amounts. The oxalic acid in wood sorrel can cause kidney stones in certain people.The author give no tips on identifying the plants referenced. Even more disturbing is the use of plants that have poionous copy cat plants, and the user is not warned individually about these plants. (Water Hemlock and Queen Anne's Lace, balsam and yew).(...). And if you are goingto eat the weeds, there are certainly resources with better content, and safety warnings than this book contains.-Your friendly forager"
5,Scott Baio Rules!! New York Rules!!,Scott Baio Rules in this film about a New York struggling photographer planning a big break photographing a famous actor who fall head over heels in love with the actor's daughter.It's a great romantic film!!
3,A treat for Bowie fans,"I wasn't expecting much from this, but it's actually quite fun, providing a refreshingly hummable take on Bowie's biggest hits."
4,BUY THIS CD,"Actually,I am not speak and write english very well, so I need your helpI think this is one of the best cd ever I brought This cd's merit is slow and calm mood if you want to feel good mood or when you feel lonely, I recommend this cd(especially,I think rainyday and gloomyday good match with this cd)"
1,What CD is this?,"I have the original issue CD on the Universal Music label,11-11-1992. This CD has a different issue date, different cover pic, different label,(Polygram) and completely different track layout and missing tracks.(Universal=15 tracks, Polygram=12). The original tracks were: 1.It's Crazy 2.How Did He Look 3.Let There Be Love 4.Close Enough For Love 5.The End Of A Love Affair 6.Bewitched, Bothered, And Bewildered 7.I wish You Love 8.You've Changed 9.I Only Have Eyes For You 10.A Mark On Your Mind 11.I Love You For Sentimental Reasons 12.Maybe September 13.Do It Again 14.More Love 15.Les Feuilles Mortes.What in the world is going on here?My CD is a bit beat up,(I've played it so much), and I can't find another copy anywhere. Can anyone help?"
4,"Touching, Heartwarming, Soothing To The Soul","Parents who've lost a child find it hard to remember the good times without breaking down into tears. They also have a hard time handling their loss when normal everyday events, such as walking down a cereal aisle, can bring so much pain. In Down The Cereal Aisle, grieving parents (not experts, not writers) share their pain, their sorrows, and their joys in hopes of helping other parents know they are not alone and in sharing, we grow one step closer to moving through grief."
4,Vintage Maine Novel **,"This is a story of Maine,A tale of a wonderful adventurous Sarah Holt who now is the Matriarch of a coastal village(Don't you just love that word) Matriarch, well it reads like peyton place;doesn't flinch at any truth about human beings. Beautiful window on the bay with boats cover. and the cover art alone is worth the price. So If you like your novels of Maine this one is a fast and fun read."
2,It's Spanish to Me,"Vincent D'Onofrio of ""Law and Order"" takes a brief respite from crimefighting to star as Max,a bald antique dealer on hard times. Matthew Lillard stars as fast-talking Jack,a con man,and Valeria Golino is Jamie,his girlfriend expert in poisons. The plot centers on antique guns,a pile of cash,and alleged ""Spanish judges.""It's wannabe David Mamet and Quentin Tarantino. Characters are shot and poisoned. A creepy little girl leaves the story hanging--literally. The plot is complicated,and it's supposed to be ""neo-noir."" It's not a great movie by any means,but it makes great ""huh?"" early morning viewing."
1,WORST GAME EVER,"Wow, just stick w/ march madness 2005 becuz this gME is terrible. It is slow gameplay and the player ratings arent accurate. I bought the game and the next day i returned it b/c it sucked so much. Stick to 2005"
2,Needs work on gameplay,"This game will piss you off real quick..and I really gave it a chance. The computer AL is just not balance right or something, It's no fun trying to rebound when you got the position, make a pass to an open player, or make the wide open shots!.. but no problem for the computer though...(smile) No matter where you set the settings ..it's either too hard or too easy and this just sucks the fun right out of it. Well guys or ladies..you've been warn! Just buy yourself college 2k6 and you want be disapointed if just want a good ol fashion college basketball game with much better gameplay."
3,Good game for the price.,This game is like every other basketball game in 2006 except it's collage basketball and has collage teams instead of NBA teams.
4,playing defense,"if your struggling playing defense you need to learn how to cut off the passing lanes. when you do that push up on the right analog button and good defenders will steal the ball. you can also slap the full court man to man on and get in front of the player the inbounder is trying to pass to. you can go on huge runs by doing this. you have to play a game more than one time before giving bad reviews, every game has its little system that you have to learn before mastering it. i think this game is very very fun. you can use any team and the recruiting option is great. i strongly recommend it to any college basketball fan. the only draw back is you cant transfer players from this game to nba live 2006 which you could in the past."
3,Problems freezing up,"This game is fun, but we also had problems with the game freezing up. The freezing was bad to the point where we thought the game was defective and returned it. The third party seller did not refund shipping as promised."
4,It's not THAT bad!!!!!,Looking at some of the reviews I thought the game was bad but I bought it anyway. The game is a bit fun. Some parts need work but fun. I really like the commentary because they make it seems like real-life. The music okay but could've had something else than marching band music. Dynasty mode is pretty cool. And THANKFULLY you can switch the players numbers to random names. So rent it and give it a shot. You'll never know.......
1,Missing pre-fab holes and is not 8 ft tall at the edges,"The parts are designed to fit into each other and have holes that line up for bolting them together. However, many of the pieces were missing prefab holes.Also the legs are just 5 feet tall. I was expecting longer legs since the height is supposed to be 8 feet.I went to request a return but amazon just gives the phone number and email of the vendor for RMA. In reading the return notes, it looks like I will be stuck with the return shipping cost. This box is very heavy. So it will cost a bundle to return it. I will update the review if they refund my return shipping cost.I could not assemble it and so I can not review its utility."
3,tight.,"got this for a history of medicine course i took in my senior year of college. it actually is pretty gnarly if you get into it. i usually dread reading textbooks; this is one of those exceptions. basically, if yr taking a history course & yr teacher assigns you this, consider yrself lucky."
5,Charts the rise and changing of disease patterns,"The impact of human history on epidemic disease is related in Dr. Bollett's Plagues And Poxes, an excellent medical-based survey which charts the rise and changing of disease patterns throughout human history. From key events which sparked changes and people involved in them to how inflections diseases have been stopped, Plagues And Poxes provides both a case history and a social analysis, written by a medical doctor who has been a member of many prestigious medical history societies."
3,"Ok, but a little thin","I am using this book in a class I am currently teaching. It's fine, gives a decent rundown on the major plagues and includes non-infectious plagues which adds another dimention to the text. Still, it is a tad brief for anything much other than an overview."
5,Easy reading... even for Joe six pack,"Dr. Bishop has made a fine art out of finding problems with modern polling techniques, and illustrates his abilities in this fine book. While he is quick to point out the problems with commercial and political polling, Dr. Bishop does not discount the practice entirely. This would be a good book for anyone who believes political polls have the pulse of the American public."
4,The Best Book on the Impact of Nomads on Sedentary Peoples,"Of the 50+ books I have read on Central Asia, this book is by far the most insightful. This is more than a history of Central Asia -- it is a whole treatise on the impact of the nomads on the sedentary peoples. The book also places a heavy emphasis on the origins of various peoples (Turks, Mongols, etc.) and their relationships. The displacement of the Indo-Europeans by the Turks in Central Asia (from western China to present-day Uzbekistan) also makes for facsinating reading. There is also detailed discussions about Genghis Khan and the Mongols -- frankly much better than most other books I've read that deal with only that topic.On the negative side, the book focuses too much on Genghis Khan and generally has a pro-Mongol bias. Some of the maps are also quite unhelpful and do not correspond to the text too well.Nonetheless, this old book is still the best around after all these years."
3,good maps,"This book seems rather typical of histories of inner Asia: difficult and hard to follow. I guess it just goes with the territory. Too many clans vying for territory and too much internecine jostling for power within each clan. And nobody holds on to power for more than a generation or so. Still, this book does seem to handle it better than most others; at least an effort is made to point out which struggles are more important. Dated, but still has some penetrating insights. What I found most useful, however, were the maps. These are good maps, and there are plenty of them. Okay, maybe not the most aesthetically pleasing, but they show you where things are. This is by far the best source of maps I have found on the history of inner Asia. If that doesn't make it worth purchasing, get it through interlibrary loan and photocopy them."
3,Probably correct but tedious,"Groussets book seems well researched and has no major flaws, that I have found. But it is an old style kind of ""royal families"" account, that more or less leaves you in the dark, unless you have the time and resources to follow the complicated geography embedded. His habit of mentioning turk, arab, chinese and what knows I spellings of everything makes it rather a hard read.Someone could make a readable book out of it by reducing it by 50% and take some hard decisions on the vocabulary (that could be explained in an appendix).Reading it - as I have - with a special interest in the cities of the steppes I found a lot of names but almost nothing on their importance (including size).BAN"
4,The Empire od the Steppes,An unbelievably well-researched account of how countless hordes of Mongol and Turcic peoples terrorized most of the world with their incessant east-to-west murderous migrations for more than 23 centuries of RECORDED history. Reading this book gives the reader a good understanding of the reasons for the great cultural and political chasm existing today between the West and the Near East/Central Asia.
3,Was once the standard,"But Alas, no longer. Though still a very understudied region, the modern interpretation of Central Asian history is quite different from that which is laid out in this text. Still very valuable, but it must examined in conjunction with other, more recent, sources."
4,Joe Pickett? Must be the author himself.,"As reviewer Joe Pickett said, this book is well-written and enjoyable. My personal preference is for single state travel books, because they are more exhaustive in their coverage, and thus more useful when traveling. The reason for this review is my amusement at finding an earlier review of this book from 2000 written by Joe Pickett. Joe Pickett is the name of the fictional hero of author C.J. Box's excellent mystery series set in Wyoming, and these books started appearing in 2001, after this review, with the award winning Open Season. I love these books, a perfect blend of mystery and western. So what say you, Mr. Box? Did you write the 2000 review for this book? I also can't help but wonder if C.J. Box is your real name. Perhaps you are a relative of Edgar Box, Gore Vidal's famous pseudonym."
1,Did not last long,This decoration was my favorite for 3 weeks until it grew dull colored and developed blackened spots on it that resembled mold. I removed it from my tank.
5,Miles Ahead review,"This contains many short and personal ""God stories"" by different individuals. I thought I would use it as a daily devotional but became too interested in the stories and read it in a few days time. Well, I suppose I could read them again and use a little restraint."
1,mask to hide my face after watching this movie,"I got this in a Region 2 two disc set with both Henry 1 + 2 released by Dutch-Filmworks. The original is great, but ""mask of sanity"" was the worst bottom of the barrel el-cheapo z-grade attempt at a horror film I have ever been witness to. No script (to speak of) no talent and nothing to keep you watching it through to the end. It also looks like it was shot on video tape.... Fans of the original will be mortified."
2,Not too good...,"I was very excited to see the part 2 of that great movie ""Henry"". First one was a real deal. In part II however, not only do they change the actor for Henry, the plot itself was pretty much the same thing as the original! What are you tring to do rip off moive fans? I understand this movie was made as a documentary style but... come on!disappointed viewer sighs..."
3,Is this the first or second? Because...,"NOTHING HAS CHANGED (except for the actor playing Henry). We have the sick killer taken in by unknowing people, one of whom falls for him, and the killer invites one to murder with him. The guy who is Henry is ok, but I thought Mike Rooker was better for the role. Personally, I would have preferred something fresh, but this is a good 80 minute break from reality."
4,Henry II - Portait of a Serial Killer,"A good film of its type, which is more realistic than a typical Hollywood serial-killer films."
3,Good but standard,"While not a bad movie as many seem to believe, ""Henry 2"" of course doesn't compare to the classic original. The innovative, stark horror was there in the first film; it isn't present in any great degree in the sequel. So this is basically a good, standard thriller, a nice follow-up but not really the same type of film."
5,Creative Computer Tools for Artists: Using Software to Deve,This book was extremely helpful. It provides clear instruction and beautiful examples of how many different artists have used computer software to explore innumerable possibilities for a painting in a short period of time. Pollard and Little have presented the material in an easy to read style. It gets right to the point. An excellent tool for any artist.
5,Sprinking truth in the darkness,"I started reading Parenti through this book that I got after I met him. It is offensive... if truth offends... It is subversive... if trying to expose reality is going against the well established lies. It is brief and straight to the heart of the problem, the one that many people refuse to face. Perhaps it is its briefness that makes it even more palatable in this oppressive days when the markets rule the world."
2,If you've never considered this point of view...,"The book is fine. However, if you are looking for an algorithmic exposition, with motives, an incite into how legal systems, corporations, finance, and world trade are manipulated in actual terms...the book falls short. Regrettably, the author takes the position against the ""Empire"" and rails instead of elucidates. Not a very good read if you have a well researched opinion and you want more info."
1,Unreliable,"This book is not serious scholarship, it is merely an op-ed piece. The author, Michael Parenti does not provide any footnotes to back up his claims; strange coming from a scholar from Yale. No matter how much is said that conforms to my beliefs about politics it simply cannot be relied on as there is almost no evidence within."
4,Great!,"This film is a great video to see if you love the Olsentwins. It's even better if you first watch The case of the sea world adventure, as this one is a sequel to it. The twins are on board of a cruise ship as their father's computer is stolen."
5,Keep on Keepin' On,"I truly loved this book about a legendary bluesman. He seemed to be up-front and honest about his personal life and trials as well as experiences in the cutthroat world of music as business. Interviews-with/comments-from ""stars"" in the music industry like Linda Ronstadt, Bonnie Raitt and Mick Jagger showed just what an indelible mark Taj has made on their lives. Stories from Taj's family were poignant."
2,You don't know what you are getting.,"At this writing date, the listed manufacturer on the Amazon page for this fan is ""Alpha and Omega Computer,"" which is a wholesaler of fans. Their website lists the manufacturers of their 60 mm x 25mm ball-bearing fans as Sanyo, Evercool, and Sunon. These are all decent fan brands, and they have a range of specs for airflow (cfm), speed, and noise. However, the Amazon page for this fan currently lists no brand or specs, so you won't know which fan you will get. I received a 24 cfm Sunon fan with 34 dbA, which is quite loud for a small fan, and is the loudest fan that Alpha and Omega carry for this approximate cfm. For example, there is Sanyo fan with a higher cfm at 28 dbA, which is significantly quieter. So if noise matters to you, I'd buy a fan with the manufacturer and specs listed, otherwise you may find the noise very annoying."
2,"Nostalgic, Pre-1980 look back at the way it was.","This book was interesting in it's look back. I found no information that would have been relevent to the modern day casino, or the games of the 90's. Readers would be better served to use the price of this book in a modern day quarter machine."
3,"Beautiful, but made in China","In the past, I believe this pattern had been made in England or Germany. Now it is made in China. It is beautiful and I will use it as a centerpiece to hold my prettiest Christmas ornaments. I guess the price is right for where it is made."
1,Roots of heaven,"Beware!I bough the film in blu ray format edited by Twilight Time at a rather hefty price . Unfortunately it does not play. the menu shows up but I cannot activate the start bouton on my all zones LG blu ray player. I own more than 500 blu rays old and new, all playing well,so I do not think its a software update issue, but rather a production defect. Has someone else experienced the same?The Roots of Heaven (1958) [Blu-ray]"
5,Errol Flynn's real swan song....,"It seems that most people don't know what makes a great film--John Huston did. If you know where to look you can find it in this one. Great story, perfect score, fantastic cinematography, elephants, Orson Welles, elephants, Trevor Howard and Errol Flynn. Great film. Elephants. The Twilight Time blu-ray looks and sounds terrific. Shot on location in Chad, the scenery is incredible....you can feel the heat and taste the dust....this is a truly wonderful film which most people today (unfortunately) could never enjoy. Errol Flynn makes every scene his, while Orson Welles does what he does best. This one needs to be remembered...."
3,"Good, but must replace every few years","The body of this nozzle is ZINC. Just like the cheaper ones, it will corrode all the way through and require replacement. Don't be fooled by the nice foam cover. To last for many years it needs to be brass."
3,Nice feel... looks good... sprays great... but leaks at connection point...,Nice feel... looks good... sprays great... but leaks at connection point... on all 3 of the hoses I've tried it on.. so it's the nozzle not the hose at fault here. Leak didn't appear for about a month.
1,Not Made in the USA! MADE IN CHINA!,"Not Made in the USA! MADE IN CHINA!I just received my order and these are not made in the USA they were made in CHINA... I ordered two each of the following nozzles 573, 573TF, and 593. They are all made in China. I contacted Gilmour and they said that all their nozzles are made in China now. I purchased these as gifts as I have one that everybody loves, but it was made in the USA. I try very hard to do my part and buy American."
2,A Sad Farewell,"I have mixed emotions about this one. Laurel and Hardy fans SHOULD see this one, because it is the last film the boys did.But be prepared, Stan was in poor health at the time. He was a diabetic and suffered terribly during the heat. He was only 60, but looked like death warmed over. The film is NOT typical L&H; comedy, but a poor attmept at political satire. Sorry folks, that just WASN'T the boys style. With poorly dubbed dialog for the non-English speaking performers, it's a little irritating at first. There is still some magic left, like Stan ""burping"" his pet lobster, when he and Ollie take the boat engine apart, only to have the pieces fall overboard and where Stan pours oil over troubled water. I just wish the film had been made when the boys were in better health and could have had more controll. In his final years,even Stan called this film an ""abortion"" True fans of L&H; should remember them in their prime, like ""The Music Box""and ""Way Out West"""
3,Laurel and Hardy's Cinematic Swansong,"A 1951 French-Italian production, Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy's unjustly maligned ""Atoll K"" deserves another look - particularly in regard to the now-available German version. If you have only seen the mutilated public-domain dupes of ""Utopia"" (the 1954 U.S. release), the 87-minute ""Dick und Doof erben eine Insel"" is quite a surprise in terms of its excellent print quality and the additional subplot with co-star Suzy Delair. The team's cinematic swansong includes some memorable sight gags and a surprising amount of political satire. Though somewhat marred by Stan and Ollie's declining health, the admirably offbeat ""Atoll K"" remains superior to the team's post-Hal Roach efforts."
1,A sad ending,"This very last movie Laurel & Hardy made was a disaster. They expected to film for about a month but it took a year to complete. Stan fell ill and had to undergo surgery. After having been released from hospital he should have taken a rest but being a professional he felt obligated to make the movie.He was in a lot of pain and it certainly shows in this film. Stan also lost a lot of weight and both looked old and tired, which was partially due to the fact that the director had them waiting for days before calling them for some scenes.Don't ever start a collection with this one. It might put you off for the rest of your life!"
4,an exellent movie,THIS FRENCH MOVIE -YES THE PRODUCERS ARE FRENCH- PUT OLLIE AND STAND IN AN ISLAND. THIS MOVIE IS ONE THE LAST MOVIES THEY FILMED
4,Couldn't put it down,"I also was slightly disappointed with the escape aspect of the book. I was expecting a Houdini style escape, perhaps on multiple occasions or repeated attempts; however I became enthralled with the story, Rhone's character, and his relationships. I disagree with the reviewer that accuses the book of getting bogged down in the middle. Quite the contrary, the action and events were fast paced throughout. The characters had more depth and believability than those of much more reknown authors (such as Lee Childs). I could not put the book down for the last 75 pages, and enjoyed the ending as well. Great read."
2,Not much of a prison break novel,"The cover copy on this book bills it as prison break story but it's mostly about how horrible it is to be trapped in a Soviet Gulag. An American escape artist is blackmailed by the CIA into going to the USSR disguised as a Russian dissident. He is supposed to get himself arrested and then break out of Lubyanka prison with a Russian scientist who knows some top secret information. Along the way he falls in love with the woman pretending to be his sister and then gets himself sent to a Siberian work camp (he doesn't meet Ivan Denisovitch, though).The whole book is very dreary and slow going. The prison escape highlighted on the back of the book doesn't happed for a long time and then is mostly a matter of knocking out a guard. The author does seem to know a lot about the Soviet Union, though."
4,A good cup of coffee after we doctored it up a little!,"This is a good hazelnut coffee with just the right strength for my wife and me. We brewed a medium cup of coffee on the Keurig and the flavor was perfect after we doctored it up with our sweetener and a little cream. It was a medium strength cup of coffee with a hint of hazelnut in the flavor.Without being sweetened and without the cream it was rather harsh, strong and had an aftertaste. It would depend on how you like to prepare your coffee. I couldn't drink it straight but it was more than acceptable after we prepared it. It is a good cup of coffee and if you like hazelnut then you will like this.I posted a photo of the K-Cup."
4,Love that Meg!,"This is a one gulper! I finished it in 24 hours. My first experience with Donna Andrews was with Crouching buzzards, and laughed so hard during that book my family thought I was loosing it. I rushed right out and bought all of her previous works. I really love the Meg series, and this new one didn't disappoint. Please write faster Donna"
3,Parrots are the stars,"This book was not as good as the others. I figured ""who done it"" right away. I hope the rest of the series get beter. I like Meg but if I were Michael I find someone else to live with. Meg finds too many dead bodies. I like her dad. He's a hoot."
5,the funniest so far,"In a series of very funny books, this one stands out as the best so far. Donna Andrews has a real talent for writing laugh out loud scenarios. Whenever an animal (or her dad) enters a scene, you know it is going to be uniquely written, extremely funny and never disappointing. This one, with parrots, monkeys and a tiger, is my favorite, so far. Another plus with Andrews is that you do not get the same plot over and over. The settings and situations change. The main characters do not and you would not want them to, since the zanies are becoming favorite relatives, her brother and her dad especially. This is a set of books you can add to your library and know that you will want to come back to again and again. Highly recommended."
2,Not as Good as previous,"I loved the first book in this series, but this book lacked that same warmth. It is just chock full of totally bizarre characters and not enough of the good characters. I really tried to finish this book, but I just couldn't care enough about what happens to anyone in it."
4,Great Swashbuckling Adventure,"A swashbuckling adventure written in the first person, this is a wonderful and exciting story taking place in the France of Louis XIII, and Cardinal Reichleu. De Berault, the main character, is a notorious duellist. He is arrested for for killing a man in a duel, despite the Cardinal's eddict against duelling. He is given a choice, either he hangs, or works as an agent for the Cardinal. Guess which he chooses..."
2,The memory lives on.,"This novel revives memories of an excellent BBC radio play in the early 1960's and long had I searched for the book. After reading this work my impression, even after many years, is that the radio play was far superior, and I am left disappointed."
4,retro kicks,Great shoe - comfortable and stylish. The exact shoe I wanted as a kid but my folks thought was a waste of money.
1,Very bad...,"This movie would be a decent one if you could watch it for free on the internet, but is absolutely not something to sell for money. Just some pictures, some music, and narration. No facts, no science, no footage. Very bad."
1,I'm not going to leave much of a review because it doesn't rate a review.,"You know, I am sick of all of these so called ""scientists"" who make sensationalist claims with no evidence and expect us to believe it. This documentary is full of so much speculation and garbage that is passed off as fact, it makes me sick. Don't bother with this video; it is worthless; absolutely worthless.""We really didn't know anything about our universe until about the late 40's."" What?! These people have no clue of the history of astronomy at all!"
1,Remake or Parody?,"Some songs should be left alone. This is one of them. Blue is one of too many 'easy-on-the-eyes' Brit pop groups with more show than substance. When their record company or whoever the hell controls them decided to take American R&B group Next's 1998 summer smash and give it some amount of insipid, ubiquitous top 40 charm, he/she/they should have been stopped. And fired. I was sorely disappointed when I heard it on Capital FM. In fact, DJs should have refused to play it. And they probably would have if they had heard the original first. Enough said."
1,"disgrace to ""r'nb""","blue ""covered"" nexts' 1998 hit Too Close for their third single. Although it was a big hit, the song itself is garbage. Instead of the slow and sultry version that Next performed now we have 4 lads going on a night out and trying to pull the birds using karaoke. I disagree with a ""Music Fan not from UK"" when he/she states this sounds identical to the Next version. This is not even 5% of what the Next version is. Instead of sounding smooth and hitting the right notes like they are supposed to Blue sound like they are extremely bored and sing with no emotion. The female vocals are even worse than the Next version. Overall this song is TERRIBLE."
3,FYI for the possible buyer,track list of the single:1 Too Close (Radio Edit)3:452 Too Close (Blacksmith R&B; Club Rub)5:413 Too Close (Instrumental)3:45Video Too Close 3:45
4,Second Hit Single,"""Too Close"" is a cover of US R&B group Next's 1998 hit. Blue's version managed to notch the top spot in the UK on the first week of release. This version is less R&B and more mainstream but the influence is apparent. This single serves as an excellent follow up to their mighty debut ""All Rise"" from the album of the same name. The tracklisting are as follows:1. Too Close (Radio Edit) 3.452. Too Close (Blacksmith RnB Club Rub) 5.413. Too Close (Instrumental) 3.454. Too Close (Enhanced Video)The song itself is great. But I wouldn't recommend you buy this single because the price is a little steep for three tracks. If you're a fan, by all means, go on and collect the single. If you're into their first and second single, you might as well get the album because it's a rather good one."
3,"good insight, lots of words","After finishing this book I look back on it and feel as though not much was actually said. I enjoyed the perspective on people reactions to such awful conditions, but, to me the book seemed very wordy.Perhaps this was just due to personal taste and this is not my type of read."
3,A plague devestates a normal town.,"Although Camus brilliantly provides meaning to his tale, the story is overly enlongated and there is too much wasted description."
2,"Read ""Blindness"" and Pass on The Plague...","Dr. Rieux, the main character of the novel, moves throughout the book in a detached surreal hopeless manner. He goes thru the motions of ""doing his job"" while death surrounds him from a wide spread and accelerating plague.I find Jose Saramago's ""Blindess"" to be a far superior book to The Plague. Similar theme and concept but more descriptive and moving. The Plague was clinical in its approach - almost bloodless.I found this highly acclaimed book to be very difficult to re-read, often having to re-read many pages over and over. I would pass on this book."
3,"Good points, but overly descripted and elongated","I found some of Camus' ideas very interesting, but the book could be compacted to under 100 pages. Also, the art in writing a book also includes the art of storytelling, which Camus is not a master of like Jack London. The book also does not possess the depth as those of Faulkner or Joyce, and I found it quite boring. The book is like the town: lifeless."
5,Naked Morality,"Camus' The Plague is at once disturbing in detail and beautiful in content. Camus strips away the self-righteous facades of contrived morality and displays its true character: idiosyncratic, open, nonpresumptuous nakedness. As we read The Plague, we follow the struggles of a doctor who is tasked to heal the unhealable. The reasons he gives, as well as the reasons that all characters give, for his quiet heroism are simple, and by virtue of its simplicity, reaffirms the difficulty we all face in making moral decisions. Sad, inspiring, disturbing, and subtle, The Plague is the story of humankind naked, groping its way through human tragedy. And in the valiant attempt to save the townspeople, Camus essentially saves us all."
4,THOUGHTFUL TAPESTRY OF THE COMPLEXITY OF WAR AND COURAGE..,"My first read of this book a few years ago had left me with the impression that it made for a sordid case of existential disenchantment.Camus to me was the hero of life's pointlessness, the murky messenger of resistance and its impossibility, the contemporary writer who proved that life was a plague and its victims were condemned to an endless cycle of futile revolt.On the second read, however, the book is nowhere near as despondent as I recall it. Far from it.It is about courage, about engagement, about paltriness and generosity, about small heroism and large cowardice, and about all kinds of profoundly humanist problems, such as love and goodness, happiness and mutual connection. It weaves a complex hope offered by resistance and the urgency of understanding the long, deep reach of war's corrupting power.A very, very satisfying and thought provoking read."
5,illuminates the darkling plain we live on,"Camus' ""The Plague"" touched me in a way I like to be touched. Wanting to feel the slight warmth of human breath infusing cold darkness, a clutching of fingers across a chasm of hopelessness, I responded gratefully to the vision Camus creates in his metaphorical plague. I was particularly gratified by the swimming scene, a place in the book where two careworn men lay aside their baggage of horror and futility and tear joy from a macabre landscape, making it their own, ever so briefly, as we all do from time to time. This is the best we can do, he seems to be saying, and so we shall carry on"
5,Beware of Rats and Nihilists,This is possibly the best book I've read in my college life. I would suggest it with all my heart to anyone not phobic of rats. Or nihilists.Check out my full book reviews at litbeetle.com!
4,Great buy!,"This book is a great story of how fragile human life is, and is a great read to put things in perspective."
5,"Depressing, painful, slow moving...Excellent!","Everthing written about how wonderful this book is is true. This book is hard core. But one thing I don't see is that this book shows that Camus could possibly rank as if not the greatest but one of the most talented writers of the 20th century. I read a lot of books, and I can't think of anyone besides Dostoyevsky that writes more powerful than Camus."
4,The Plague is about a gloomy town destined for change.,"The Plague by Albert Camus is about a gloomy town destined for change. The protagonist Dr. Rieux finds rats dying all over town, which ultimately results into an outbreak of bubonic plague. Being quarantined from the rest of the world, the people of Oran feel trapped, doomed to die.I enjoyed reading this novel, however I felt it went along slow. The author really made me feel the characters and their sorrow. It is a book I'd like to read again to fully understand some of the smaller issues."
1,Another poor EDENBOOK conversion!!,"The book is fantastic; Edenbook's sloppy, negligent conversion to kindle is a waste of your time.What Edenbooks does is take a public domain work, run it through a substandard text recognition program, then foist it on the public without so much as a proof read. It is basically one long text file, without chapter headings or Kindle-enabled sections.There are so many typos, many of them confusing grammatical typos that lose sentence ends and, combined with their spelling-check word-swapping, create strange meaningless run-on travesties, that the reading experience is ruined.These guys are parasites on the ebook world, trying to manufacture income from as little work or care as possible, and churning out unreadable garbage that gets good reviews anyway because all the reviewers are reviewing the original work, not Edenbook's incompetance. Amazon should shut them down."
1,Horrible,My son had to read for high school literature class - content was disgusting - Not recommended for young adult
2,The Plague by Albert Camus,the book was boring because it was the same thing through out the whole book. its just about people dying from a plague. dont read it.
3,"Interesting, but not great...","I wasn't as taken by the Plague as others. The story raised some strong ethical questions had any of us been put into the same circumstances. Unfortunately for me, the plagued itself lingered a bit too long. I never felt a sense of attachment to any of the characters. On the other hand, Camus offers short bursts of great insight regarding the struggles of being human."
3,I was torn about how I enjoyed it,"This is a great book...no doubt about it, but some of the style was difficult. I am sure it will go down in history as one of the great philosophical novels of our time, but its not perfect."
4,this is a great book,"nature of destiny and the human condition was written very well by Camus in this novel. It touches Absurdism, human nature and fate in a very good way.I think the book should have been shorter but nothing is perfect :)"
3,compelling moments throughout the story.,"This book is not exceptional. But I can not can not blame it on Camus. I think some weight must lie on the translation. I previously read ""The Stranger"" -- the new translation, which was much better than the first translation I had read a few years back. I am inclined to say that the translation of ""The Plague"" that I read is not a good interpretation. One of Camus' virtues is his monotone voice when describing events with a sense od detachment. ""The Plague"" has a lot of good moments and is definitely worth reading, but it feels as though the translator, Stuart Gilbert, is placing flowers where there should be none. Camus' beauty is in its barren deserted descriptions. This book should be retranslated by Matthew Ward who did an excellent job with the Stranger. I will definitely write to the publisher suggesting this, and so should all of you who decide to read this version. Regardless of all this, it is a book worth reading."
5,Quintessential Existentialism,"""The Plague"" is the archetypal piece of existentialism. Camus touches upon the human condition which in turn makes us ponder our own existence. Although the book is a trifle long, we as readers must be aware that a key characteristic of existentialism is attention to the mundane, this provides us with long descriptions of seemingly ungermane concepts. However, this book is a must for anyone who is interested in questioning man's existence, the belief in god, and the absurd. This book was translated from French, so at times, the book's sentence structure may seem akward. But the real importance lies in the extended metaphors that do not unfold immediately."
5,Engrossing,"A tremendous work that reads like a ""relaxed"" thriller. This is a must read for style, content, imagry, etc. Lots of meaning on several levels. I leave it to other reviewers to dissect it in their egotism, but I do want to mention that Camus was in Oran at the time of the plague."
3,poor translation,"I don't wish to comment on the story itself (I haven't even finished the book, in fact); merely on its style and wording. I know a bit of French, and understand the form of the language. As I read Gilbert's translation, I can see that form and style. Unfortunately, it makes it difficult to read in English. I get the impression that Gilbert tried to present the English version as close as possible to a verbatim translation of the French, and it really inhibits the flow. I find that I'm constantly caught up trying to disentangle sentences, and it makes it very hard to focus.To be fair to the translator, I've read (or attempted to read) another of work of Camus, and found it equally difficult to get through. That was a non-fiction work called The Rebel, and I assumed it was the philosophical nature of the book that made it so dense. Perhaps though, Camus' style is simply dense, whether fiction or non-fiction, great translator or poor translator."
4,I really like Camus,"And his way of weaving a story together about something as horrendous as this, in a time so different from now, just kept me coming back for more the whole time."
1,Detached and clinical,"This book has no emotion, depth or human insight. It reads like a clinical analysis. Boring and disappointing as was the Stranger."
2,Not an Introductory Text,"As an accompaniment to the program MacLogic for an upper level course I can see where this book would have a place. Unfortunately my introduction to it was tutoring for an introductory class. The material is well written and organized but far too densely written, particularly for students who have never had a logic class before and are coming from questionable mathematics backgrounds. That there is no index of symbols just makes navigating the text that much more difficult.On another level, the author seems to eschew a good many things that many other logic courses--at least those I've seen and taken--use in depth. Things like Modus Ponens are barely touched on in favor of ""v E"" (disjunction elimination). This seems unusual for an introductory textbook in the field, though I am not familiar enough to know for certain."
2,Good book but not a teaching text,"It is important to be forewarned that this is not a good text for an introductory logic class. I have taught classes using several other texts, and, although they had their flaws, the Forbes' text has flaws that are almost unsurmountable for the typical lower-division college student. The explanations, though creative,are not clear enough, and the flow of topics is out of sorts. For example, the exercises which accompany the sections start out too difficult to be any aid in helping the introductory student grasp the techniques. In short, for upper-division courses or for people who already have a logic background, this is an interesting book and might be worth a look, but it fails miserably as an introductory text."
5,This is better than FIFA 07,I recently bought a FIFA 07 after trading in my good old FIFA 06. As soon as I laid hands on FIFA 07 I realised how badly I miss FIFA 06. Gameplay in FIFA 06 is better even in amateur mode. I am sticking with my FIFA 06 for now.
5,GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOD,"First of all I'm not a kid, just didn't want to sign to make an account. The game is very very realistic, I like it a lot. The way the freekicks are taken is so amazing real cause you will have to look for the exact angle for it to enter. Also the manager mode is cool.Only one minor problem is the defense, the computer tends to choose which of YOUR player should defend, and most of the time it's not the one YOU have in mind, but you tend to get used to it. But all by all it's a great game. If you like international leagues this is the game to buy!"
2,Even worsed than FIFA 05!!!!,"While FIFA 05 had some redeeming qualities, they weren't many. FIFA 06 suffers from the same malaise. A perfect example of this would be that a small player like juninho can beat a tall player like Ibrahimovic to a header. Another problem, the entire Chinese national team all play Zidane. It can be maddening!!! These are of course examples of playing against the computer (which is still the best you can do in Manager Mode, bring back FIFA 04's Manager Mode). Also, while in Manager Mode it is nearly impossible to lat half a season with any team, even if you were undefeated up until then!!!!! I've tried to finish a season with one team, but it's impossible!!!! The graphics are worse than FIFA 05 too. Generally I miss the fun of FIFA 04. One positive thing about this game is that you do get to select the national teams...but that's pretty much it. Over all, this game is absolute rubbish!"
2,OH GOSH,"FIFA 2005 is better in practically every respect. Much more realistic look and play, more realistic graphics, more responsiveness. EA Sports took a huge step backward with the final product of FIFA 06. If I were them I would just throw out FIFA 2006 and just revamp FIFA 2005. FIFA 06 does have some better dribbling capabilities, but thats about all I can think of."
3,so so,"pretty nice, like that so many of my favorite players are in it but lacks in gameplay/tactics but will still play it here or there."
2,FIFA 2005 was much better!,"FIFA 2006 has better graphics then 2005 and could be very cool. I like some of the new options they added, like the sponsors and what not but it is so hard to score that it's just not fun at all. The 2005 version can be really easy or challenging, depending on what you like, but 2006 is hard no matter what level you put it on. Buy FIFA 2005 instead."
1,Stick with FIFA 2005,"I bought this game because I liked playing with my son in Career Mode as part of the same team in FIFA 2005. For some ridiculous reason, this option is no longer available in FIFA 2006 ????The game is also very slow, comands take way to long to take effect. The end result is pure frustration.My son and I are still playing FIFA 2005 and the new game is in the waste basket"
1,Horrible,"Fifa has always been horrible and this game is no different. The only reason I can see someone wanting to play this game is because it has the official licenses to most of the club teams. Other than that, it's just a waste of $40."
1,Programmers forgot to include tackling,"In this game there is no way to cleanly take the ball from the opponent. You can keep marking/pulling at the opponent player, but he wont give up the ball. Yet when one of my player runs into the opponent defender, he gives up the ball easy. Thats my biggest gripe.Another problem is that this game is very slow on the PlayStation 2. Play can slow down if there are a whole bunch of players on the screen at the same time. It seems PS2 is showing its age with these newer games.Please dont buy this game, as you will only be frustrated with it."
2,Where's the Fun Factor?,"I gave up my FIFA 03 in favour of this one and boy do I regret it. It's slow, the computer chooses your defenders, your passing options, why your headers are on target in easy mode but the same tactic never comes close in the more difficult modes. I bought this to have fun but when you've out-shot, out passed, out-possessed and out-tackled the opposition till kingdom come and still lose 1-0 because you're last man wouldn't tackle despite how many times you hit the button to switch defenders then it's time to swallow your pride and go dig up your FIFA 03 again. A good challenge in easy mode for the first little while but after that just bloody frustrating."
2,a bundle of irritation,"This, more even than its predecessors, is a lazy game that swaps challenge for mere irritation. Players will run off in all directions without reason, and stop, pause, and turn the wrong way to miss key passes or interceptions; will take ten yards (no joke) to stop from a run; will simply ignore a clear pass to an open player, and substitute a silly pass to a distant player on the opposite side of the pitch; and a through-ball, if too good, will magically speed up halfway through (no joke), in order to get to the keeper before an onrushing forward. In other words, EA couldn't be bothered to develop a clever game - instead, in order to make it competitive, they made it arbitrary, disingenuous, and utterly stupid."
1,horrible,"this game is horrible! The players' movement is so weird and it takes about 10 yards for a player to stop running. Don't get this game. its a waste of money. instead, get Winning Eleven 9. its only $40 and its so much better than fifa and its probably the best game in the world. (...) the best soccer game in the world (...)"
2,traded game within a week,"The graphics and commentary in this game are great however the gameplay is terrible. I have owned all of the Fifa titles since 2003. The offense is very difficult to control, the players movements are slow and it seems that it takes several seconds for the players to react to your keys when you press a button and by then it is too late (passing, stopping, etc). Also, unlike the other past Fifa titles, I spent at least 80 to 90% of my time playing defense and it's almost impossible to get the ball down to the oppenents goal to score because they always seem to strip the ball away from you. I also own the Winning Eleven 9 soccer series. Although it's more expensive that Fifa 2006, I would highly recommend it over this year's Fifa game. After owning Fifa 2006 for less than a week, I traded it. If your are still thinking about buying this game, rent it first."
4,Nice But Could Be Better!,This game is very nice on the presentation.Lots of teams and players that i dont think one can find on other football games.But one problem its gameplay should have been better.Scoring goals is a major problem you will end up with scorelines such as 1-0 0-0 etc.The manager mode is very nice and the fifa lounge is also a nice addition.Some very good trax.It needs improvment on the gameplay and should improve looking at all the other nice footie games such as pro evo.Get this game if u like challenges because its tough and takes some time to adapt to its gameplay if u want to score those amazing 20-30 yard goals then this game aint for you.
4,Gorgeous Toe Rings,"Cute, sparkly, right up my alley. Nice and inexpensive so I buy about 5 at a time. Cannot have enough! Good product and Serenity Crystal are thorough and fast shippers. (When one of the colors I ordered was out of stock they called immediately to see if I would like a replacement color. Love that customer service)"
2,How embarrassing! (Video Review),"This extensions destroys your xbox 360! Yeah! It gave me 2 red lights on my 360. 2 red lights means your 360 is ef'd up because it is a serious hardware failure indicator. Also, I passed my 1 year warranty so microsoft wouldn't fix it unless i gave them 99 dollars. the reason why i gave it a 2 star and not a 1 star is because it actually looks nice while the light is on and it holds your 360 up for you. I'm going to put a video review up if I can. is it worth 20 dollars? no... 10?... yes"
1,It broke right away.,"Within 10 minutes of using it, the green light burned, and to top it off the fans don't blow worth a damn, it ended up in the trash the same day.Only good cooler the the Intec Turbo Cooler, that's the only SAFE cooler that will suck out the heat from where it's supposed to come out."
5,Power on the go,"As great as the iPAQ pocket-pc is, it consumes a significant amount of battery when used with card phones or GPS accessories. While traveling in my car, the power ran out and I was unable to use the GPS. Now, with the new adapter, I can use it anywhere, anytime. This is a must have for all power users of the iPAQ."
3,Decent quality,"My son lost interest in this pretty quickly, but he and his friends pull it out from time to time. They've only managed to destroy one car. Slot cars are OK, but you really need a lot more track than comes in a starter kit to make it interesting."
3,"Great music, but NOT a CD for an Italian WEDDING!","We are a second generation Italian American family. My mother bought this CD in anticipation of my daughter's big Italian wedding. Upon review of the CD, we were very disappointed. While the music projected the powerful voice of Pavarotti and was beautiful, it was definitely NOT a CD that could be marketed as an Italian Wedding CD! In fact, we felt it was a bit of false advertising, marketing the CD as a wedding CD. Fortunately, we found another Italian Wedding CD by searching the net that saved the day (as it was specifically designed for an Italian American wedding and even had a guide that described the songs and dances) We just think that the Pavarotti CD should be marketed as what it really is. . .a bunch of Italian songs sung well by Pavarotti. Hope this helps future brides looking for appropriate Italian wedding music. . . ."
1,"Per favore, this is not music for an Italian wedding reception!","My husband and I spent quite a bit of money buying CDs with Italian Wedding in the title, hoping to make our wedding reception a joyous salute to our mutual Italian American heritage. We spent almost $25 for this CD, which had NOTHING we could really use in our Italian wedding, except for maybe one song during the ceremony in the church (but we had an organist for that) This is NOT a CD for an Italian wedding reception. In a way, the title is deceiving. Amore couple in Tampa"
4,Great music,"I seldom listen to this type of music, but this album caught my attention and actually enjoyed the power of his voice."
3,will mold over time,"I've had mine for at least 5 years and it does the job, but it now has black mold on the base that I can't get off. Also, the base is very lightweight so the whole thing easily tips over. The base should be made out of something heavier and mold-proof (or at least easy to clean), which would justify the $20 price. But this is one of the only racks around for drying baggies, so I'm sure they won't be in a rush to make improvements."
5,Couldn't be happier!,"Believe it or not, this simple little thing is not easy to find! I had seen one at a friend's house and thought it was ingenious. But it took me awhile to find one to buy. I should have known Amazon would have it - duh.Works like a champ, allowing bags and bottles to dry quickly and easily.I have always felt so guilty throwing away baggies, now I have a simple was to reuse them."
5,Very useful item,"I'm all about practicality, and this item is super useful for me. We save and reuse our ziploc bags so I needed something to dry them on. This works perfectly and can fold up nicely when not in use."
5,Holding up after 2+ years,"I got one of these as a wedding present two and a half years ago (it was on my registry). It's been living beside my sink and getting frequent use ever since, and so far it's in the same shape it was when I first got it. It's really handy to have and makes cleaning plastic bags SO much easier! Just a simple, efficient design. I'm very happy with it."
4,Not bad,It was a little pricey but it was as described. It's a little smaller than I would have hoped but it works.
4,Just what I was looking for!,"This has been a great addition to my kitchen- we like to reuse all of our ziplocs and covermates (shower cap for leftovers) and drying them was always tricky. Not anymore. This stand is great, hardly takes up any room. The only problem- as others have mentioned- is that it is very lightweight so it will topple over easily. One friend just drilled it into a heavy peice of wood for a base while we chose to glue it to an old, heavy ceramic coaster to give it some balance. If they fixed that, they would have a perfect product. Having said that, I am ordering one as a christmas present right now!"
1,colorless dorks,This is a very boring attempt to film Lovecraft hampered by a low budget and terrible actors.Fans of Lovecraft will not recognise his work...much of the memorable imagery of the original story The Color From Space has been discarded because the director wasn't able to realise it. There are a ridiculous number of dream sequences to try to enliven this script but after a while this becomes irritating. There is a lot of religious imagery and a little bit of sex that have nothing to do with HP Lovecraft and don't add anything to the film.For some random reason this is set in Italy which means that some nice scenery is ruined by having bad actors stand in front of it.
1,Horrible Film!,"This is a horrible film. I expect Lovecraft's work to be modified when translated to the screen, but there was very little left of his original idea in this film. This film is slow, boring, monotonous, and predictable. It was so bad I found myself apologizing to a friend who watched it with me. Very disappointing. By the end, I wanted the characters to die."
2,boring,"This is a boring and very predictable movie...the plot plods along slowly, reminding you of much better films.Its pretty obvious what is going to happen from early on but the director tries to distract from this by adding dream sequence after dream sequence...this doesn't work and is just annoying. There aren't many effects, which is wise because what there is look poor. Good acting might have still saved this but these people's talent isn't up to much.I regret buying this. Not recommended."
4,Good product,"I like this frame because it is thin and understated. It does not feel flimsy and I'd expect it to last here in Southern California because rust is not a problem.What I don't like is the mounting holes at the lower part of the frame. I know that license plates also have mounting holes at the bottom, but I have not seen a car that used those for attaching license plates. I would prefer tabs at the bottom of the frame or maybe some sort of covers to give it a finished look.Overall, a good product at a good price."
5,I recommend this frame...,"I've had a couple sets of these frames. While I do not live in a wintery climate, these frames do continue to last. I would buy these again and recommend them."
2,Terrible,"Rocket from the Crypt is easily my favorite band, and until I heard this album I thought they could do no wrong. However, All Systems Go Volume 1 proved me wrong. Even for a b-sides collection this is really awful. Most of the songs aren't even listenable, and the ones that are are usually ruined by stupid sound effects or vocal distortion. ""Live the Funk"" starts out well, but is unlistenable after the first minute due to Speedo repeating the same line roughly 83 times. They completely butchered their cover of the Big Bopper's ""Chantilly Lace"" by adding some stupid talking over the song; unfortunate because it would have been a good cover. If you're looking for Rocket from the Crypt, I would suggest ""Scream Dracula, Scream"" or ""RFTC"" over this rubbish."
3,Hell and High Water,"Boring movie. Boring movie. Boring movie, Boring movie. Boring movie. Boring movie, Boring movie. Boring movie. Boring movie. Boring movie. Boring movie. Boring movie. This was not a good movie."
2,"Weak Submarine ""Yawn""","Dull and melodramatic. Weak story line. Not one of Richard Witmarks better performances when you compare this to his work in ""The Bedford Incident"". Now there is a movie I would highly recommend for both the acting performances well as a powerful story line that is filled with emotion."
1,Sean McGrath weighs in,"Looking back on it, I regret the whole thing. If I could've done something to talk Ross and Andrew into sounding more like Snot or Converge, I would have done it. Now I wouldn't be wallowing in mediocrity and shame. I wouldn't have to hide my face in public, and I could go to a metal show without hearing the snide comments and the whispered threats. Believe me, there's nothing I like to do more than supporting ""the scene"", and because of my own lack of taste and talent, I am now a pariah; cast out of my beloved scene as a leper. I'm sorry...I'm truly, truly sorry."
1,"Sean McGrath sucks really, really bad...","Why do I even play with this guy? Sean ""Buttbath"" McGrath's guitar playing is a shameful blight within the world of death metal. This record is just the best example of his poor execution of riffing and soloing, and all the metal world suffers for it. Now, if we'd gone with my mix, which was just my excellent bass tracks, my superior low growls, and a snare hit or two, this could've been the record of the year. Thanks, Sean, thanks for ruining my life."
1,Gets older faster then your grandmother...,"I bought impaled's mondo medicale because of my friend basically told me that their one brutal band!Well, im sorry to break to all you impaled fans but this album is not brutal or nowhere near it!Okay, when i first bought it i quickly blast it on my cd player in my car thinking i would hear something heavy & brutal but insted what i got was an sound that gets old and boring faster then a serverse in church or school can get!Insted of throwing impaled's album away i sold it back to newburycomics which was a smart move and it sitll in there..ha! No one likes it---not even people who likes deathmetal! Skip this disgrace! Impaled sucks!"
4,Great gore metal!!!,"Sometimes agressive, sometimes melodic, a great record by Impaled. I also like the concept of the album: Crazy doctors taking their patients lives insted of saving them (really weird stuff, don't you think?"
3,so-so,"I don't remember how these are presented, so the product may not be misrepresented if these issues are detailed in the description. They're smaller than normal and lack the stem (for lack of a proper term) that goes into a holder. They don't smell cinnamony and are easily broken. Good price though and do smell okay."
3,Great movie; poor streaming quality,"The movie was great. Unfortunately, the streaming quality was not. I believe this was a problem with Amazon, because I have excellent upload and download speeds confirmed at times when the streaming quality was degraded for unknown reasons. It seems that each time this occurred, the problem was resolved with me exiting the Amazon video browser and reopening it. Very annoying to say the least."
5,dynamite--quality violence no social justice BS,"Quality violence, science fiction theme of russia winning ww3, then bored youth takes action----result will horrify and make u laugh bigtime!!!! malcom mcdowell is great-----so real----banned in ENGLAND for a long time---maybe even now---that enough makes me want to see films!!! This si a fun romp and a scathing review of the hypocracy of society! 5 stars at least!"
3,Average.,"I can kinda see why ""a clockwork orange"" was controversial in it's day but in today's climate this all seemed a bit undercooked. Sure, some of it was disturbing but more at Stanley Kubrick's mind rather than what was going on here. I personally find rape reprehensible and he seemed to revel in filming it, my opinion only.The film got interested when the main character was in jail and the brainwashing scenes were well done but the main problem with this film in my opinion was that it was boring and seemed to try too hard to shock.Well, I've never seen what the big deal was with Kubrick, the only film of his I've really liked was ""Dr Strangelove"", he's always struck me as a bit of a perver really."
3,A Film before its time,"Having waited a number of years to see this film I was a bit dissapointed,not by the performance of Malcolm McDowell or anyone else in the film,but I expected more.In the 70's I can see why the violence and rape scene would be disturbing,but today they seem pretty tame.I'm not saying I didn't enjoy the film and will watch it again, but why is it not for sale in Britain."
2,not ultra vioent,"every one talks about this movie being all that but it really isn't, the film only has one person murederd in it, and many people raped in it. it really isn't anything, a much more violent movie at that time is texas chainsaw mascare .another problem in this movie is a great time of this film is shown him prison when he is a good person which is pretty stupid. my advice is to watch it and not buy it."
1,a dead horse,warning this disc will not play in a blu ray player and that will be the only way to see this film in hd. on another note anyone who purchased one of those clearanced hd dvd players with the 10 free movie offers you have been swindled because to get your free movies you must send the upc and without the upc you cant return your obsolete player.
1,DEFINETELY NOT FOR ME,I BOUGHT THIS AS A GIFT AND HAD NO IDEA WHAT IT WAS ABOUT AND STILL HAVE NEVER WATCHED IT BUT WAS TOLD IT WAS NOT THAT GREAT - ALOT OF UNFIT STUFF BUT I SHOULD HAVE CHECKED ABOUT IT BEFORE I BOUGHT IT. MY NIECES HUSBAND ASKED FOR IT AND I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT ELSE TO GET SO I GOT IT BUT WOULD NOT BUY IT AGAIN.
5,A Clockwork Masterpiece,"I read the book back in high school and just recently (and grudgingly) watched the film. Why did I wait so long?! Grandiose! Remarkable! Kubrick's finest achievement. One of those rare movies that outshines its source material; with a soundtrack that doesn't smother but rather lifts the film to new heights. If you're one of those people (as I am) who's afraid to watch good books transformed (and usually trampled) to film, then put your fears aside and buy this movie. Burgess' visionary genius has been justified."
3,a disapointment,"People are so caught up with the fact that this film was made by Stanely Kubrick that they fail to realize that this movie is very bland. Yes there are some very good filming techniques, but it wasn't very satisfying. The story is great but it was brought down by the non-stop nudity which was completely superfluous most of the time. Does every house in the movie have to have pictures of naked ladies hanging from the walls of every room? Give me a break! The only people that would rate this as a five star movie are either people who are perverted or people who are stupid and think that every Stanely Kubrick film is a masterpiece."
5,Freakin' Sweet!,"Vintage movie, but on blu-ray you would've thought it was made a month ago or something! I highly recommend watching it after about two or three joints, but is still good sober too."
3,Kubrick's Vivid Universe,"Stanley Kubrick had the ability of always taking his viewers on a fantastic ride. He created new worlds for us to see,and this film is no exception. But one of the problems with this film and other works of art is,it's not accessible to everyone. Many will be turned off by the film. I almost was myself. This is not an easy film to watch due to the intense images you see. But if you just hold it out,you'll find that you'll actually enjoy this picture. Astonishing production designs and costume designs. Everything about this film grabs your attention. Everything you see will stay with you long after you've watched this movie. I personally know,they're many things about this movie I'll never forget. Not Kubrick's best,but one every Kubrick fan should see,and not to mention filmbuffs. As with other Kubrick films,this one is a visual work of art."
3,CLASSIC?,"This movie isn't bad....but it honestly does not live up to its reputation. Despite a few brilliant scenes the majority of the film seems to be an excuse to present hormonal highscool boys with scenes of rape, violence and sex. The 2 hours spent watching this movie, I'll never get back. Maybe the book is better? Would I actually seek it out? Absolutely not."
2,"Wow, I just don't get it","I'm a 26 yo male and just watched this movie for the first time tonight after a Saturday night in.I've heard about this movie my whole life. ""Everyone"" has seen it. ""Everyone"" loves it. I just don't get it. It was ""okay."" It kept me entertained, but not engaged. Yet, it was disappointing.Maybe people are attracted to the violence or nudity in the movie, I don't know. It didn't offend me in anyway, if I want nudity I'll watch porn. I was hoping for something to take away from this movie so I could share in its glory with everyone else who I've ever heard talk about it.I have no desire to see it again. I don't recommend it. If anything, watch it just so you can say you've seen it. It seems to come up in ""movie conversation"" every couple years or so. I'm more mad at myself than anything--I really wanted to like this movie, but I didn't. Maybe I should start a support group for the 1% of us who didn't enjoy it."
1,What is wrong with Warner Brothers?,"Why would Warner Brothers release a collector's edition of Clockwork Orange without featuring the film in widescreen. Yes, Kubrick was rarely a user of widescreen film but in Clockwork Orange the ratio is probably 1.66:1. This is a horrendous attack on good taste and a blantant exploitation of the recently deceased Stanley Kubrick. To WB: Keep an artist's work in tact especially if you intend to exploit him selling it at 45 dollars and placing it in a cool new case."
1,Long Goodbye,"This atrocious film began the 30 year decline that sadly closed out the career of Stanley Kubrick. Artistically burned out after completing ""Dr. Strangelove"" and ""2001"", Kubrick wanted to film a biography of Napoleon, but was balked by a lack of financing. Not a man who let go of an obsession easily, he marked time over the next three decades by turning out five movies totally devoid of the committment he had shown in his early work.The author of the original novel, Anthony Burgess, was so sickened by Kubrick's mangled film that he eventually repudiated the book entirely, as well he might. The suggestion that psychopaths should be allowed to exercise their free will to wreak havoc on society is so transparently idiotic nobody can take it seriously. Combined with the terrible acting, cheap sets, and relentless vulgarity and misogyny, the result is about as ugly as moviemaking gets."
1,excessive violence,"Too much violence associated hard to stare at the screen or follow the storyline....if one can tolerate, you would enjoy this satire."
2,Poor,"I watched an edited version of this ""masterpiece"" and was disappointed. I gather that the prime objective was to challenge the ideology of a politically-motivated, self-righteous society and the value of individualism but the director simply fails to coherently develop that idea in anything concrete leaving the audience bemused in the end."
1,NOT WHAT IT SAYS.,"This does not come with a ""steel case"". the DVDs come in a plastic, average case and then that is slipped into the steel cover. PLUS, mine came opened which makes me wonder what they are trying to pull. plastic doesn't rip itself apart...."
2,Not Kubrick's Best,"Very disappointing film. I feel that it was scuppered from the outset by the casting: the actors playing the droogs are plainly much too old to be playing teenagers. What's most bothersome however is the way Kubrick soft-pedalled the more unpleasant aspects of the book. Without exception, all Alex's victims are more 'obnoxious' than they are in the novel, as if Kubrick was attempting to 'justify' their treatment at his hands. This attitude is completely inexcusable. It is no wonder that Burgess was very unhappy with the film and chose to distance himself from it: a book about the importance of free-will had been altered beyond recognition into nothing more than a vindication of its main character.Reading the previous reviews, I am troubled by how this film is almost universally regarded as the epitome of ""cool."".END"
1,Total Crap and that is Generous,"I am sure this movie will appeal to spoiled brats who resent their parents and the establishment in this twisted immorality play. The film was playing when I was in college, and although I thought the poster looked neat, I never saw it. I realize now that it was garbage just like all those ""Billy Jack"" movies and the ""One Tin Soldier"" theme song. I saw the movie on Showtime recently and could not finish watching it. It was the kind of crap that only a liberal intellectual could love. I do own 2001 on Blue-Ray and appreciate that movie."
1,Tries Too Hard,"I hate this movie. I think Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey was much better. I even love Malcolm McDowell and think he is a great actor, but that wasn't enough to redeem this movie. I am dating myself here, but when this movie first came out I think people were into it for shock value alone. I think this movie tries too hard to be avant-garde. There was nothing that made me care anything about what happened to any of the characters in the film, either the perpetrators of violence or their victims. Watching this movie is like banging your head into a wall over and over."
2,NOT X,"This is stupid. It said it was the rated X version. But no, its the rated R version. This could very well upset my day. I am very upset with amazon for this error."
1,The movie is just awful....dreadful...dated....bad....,"I like movies. I've watched a lot of bad movies. I've even liked a lot of bad movies (I loved Ishtar), but after years of hearing what a ""classic"" Clockwork Orange is I finally got around to seeing it last month (3/2001). And OH MY GOSH it was bad.Not bad it a fun, provocative, campy, entertaining way. But bad in a way that makes you question your need for a VCR in the first place. The story was non-existent, the editing was frantic and distracting, the violence was pointless (which some will say WAS the point) and it made no sense.The story of alienation, ennui, post-war angst has been told in so many better movies since CO came out that I guess I might be missing the ""ground breaking"" aspects of this film, but I have to say that this movie has not held up well over the year.If you have two hours to waste just saw your arm off with a rusty butter knife. It will be less painful than watching Clockwork Orange."
2,This movie isn't all it is brought up to be,Well I can first say that when I rented this movie I kind of judged the movie by it's cover. Anyway the only good thing that I can say about this movie is the acting. Wonderful acting but also some very gangly parts like for example it isn't a very good scene when they beat up the BUM with there sticks and chains but I guess you could say that this movie is well acted out but I wouldn't call it a masterpiece. But if you like weird movies then go ahead but I honestly to tell you the truth spend your money on a GOOD movie. Not to offend anyone's taste in a movie
1,they don't give the option of zero stars,This film is yet another load of crap from Kubrick. A complete waste of time.
2,Agree wholeheartedly film pale version of book,"I agree wholeheartedly with the reviewer that says that the original book is an intriguing piece of literature while the movie does indeed seem to glamorize violence. For the reviewer who claimed that scenes are dark and satirical, I don't agree. The book explores how violence and rape is used to create power over others. Kubrick does not get that across in his movie, so the movie does come across as gratuitous. This film should be given a miss in favor of the book. That is often true, but I think it is so in this case in particular. Also, if you happen to speak Russian, check out the nadsat language used in the book. It is a very clever manipulation of Russian words into a unique slang."
5,"Right, right.... Right, right","This was the best movie ever. people how say it was disterbing, and sick. They don't know what there talking about, I admit there was a couple nude scence but if you read the book it has it all. Kubrick was just tying to make it like the book. so people who say it was a bad movie they better watch it and get it this time. Just remember all that he did leads up to the end and how everything is so.....WATCH THE MOVIE TILL YOU GET IT AND IF YOU DONT GET WATCH WITH SOME ONE THAT WILL SO THEY CAN TELL YOU WHATS ABOUT!!!!"
5,Simply the best movie ever,This is the best movie ever. The kill factor is hi. The imagery is amazing. The soundtrack is...for lack of a better term...off the hook. The acting is great. Burgess's book is great and this movie is even better! Way better! I love the way cynical master Kubrick left out the last chapter!!!! Evil reigns supreme!!!! This movie made me mean. Real mean. I hate all of you.
1,Good Movie - Bad DVD,This is a great movie. I can not believe that some of the movies in the new Stanley Kubrick collection are formatted and in mono! The Killing and Killer's Kiss are not included in the box set. What? Did the studio decide those movies were trash or something?? Kubrick supposedly approved this monster of a dissapointment. I find that hard to believe.People! Save your money. Why not just buy some video tapes if you're getting TV-formatted movies with mono sound. It's truely a shame.
5,Shocking & Inspirational,"This film is a classic. It addresses the quandry of rehabilitation vs. ethical retribution. Who decides the nature of punishment and the motivation of personal revenge? The concept of ""Murder of the Mind"" vs. necessary behavior modification? I think that it will make you consider more intimately such questions, and the motivation of the penal system."
4,scary,"When I first read this book at the age of 16, it seemed to me nothing more than a fascinating--and sexy--romp in the world of scientific futurism (or should I say, science fiction). But then along came writers like behavioral scientist B.F. Skinner, whose ""Beyond Freedom and Dignity""--in a way not unlike ""The Stepford Wives""--intimated to me that what was at first merely suggested might become the norm of America. God help us, ""A Clockwork Orange"" is scary!!!"
5,"Excellent, strange and dangerous...","One of Stanley Kubricks masterpieces or perhaps ""The masterpiece"". And excellent movie based on Burgess novel from 1962, written in nadsat, a teenage ""streetlanguage"" Burgess invented. The movie describes the evil future society, where Alex and his droogs (friends) make a lot of trouble. Alex get caught and in prison they try the ""Ludovichi"" treatment on him."
5,"New vs. Old, Shocking vs. Distasteful","This movie is a great adaptation of the book. Though all the themes are not brought in the movie, it really compares at old politics versus new politics. It also looks at the age old conflict between the youth and the adults. All those who think this movie is extremely violent and it glorifies any kind of violence truly are missing the point. All of the violent images are meant to shock you. Kubrick uses the familiar visuals and sounds to make us uncomfortable and question our own society. It is a brilliant movie that is not for people who can't look beyond the visual representation. Great Film!!"
5,MUST SEE!!!,"Amazing portrayal of the effects of a violent youth on society, and the effects of society on the violent youth in turn. Not enough can be said for Malcom McDowell's genious, artistic performance as the lead character ""Alex"". This character would be despised if played by any other actor, but Mr Mcdowell's rendition somehow finds us leaving the film with an almost endearing ""fondness"" for the boy.Fabulous must see art film, but definitely not for sissies!"
3,Weird movie that drags on forever.,"The sound recording is bad, often sounding like they were miked from back at the camera so there's a lot of echo and the actors tend to mumble a lot making it hard to make out what they are saying. Also, from about the middle to the end it's slow and tends to drag on forever. After an hour I kept looking at my watch a lot wondering when it was going to end."
1,pist,I can't believe this movie wouldn't even play in my dvd player. Now after I already bought the movie I see in small letters that if says the movie won't play in most U.S. dvd players. So my question is why sell it in the U.S. then?
1,A CLOCKWORK ORANGE,"Stanley Kubrick's A CLOCKWORK ORANGE was at the time a controversial motion picture. The dirctor withdrew it until its re-release in 2000, a year after his death.While many audiences consider the film a masterpiece, I consider the film rather poor. Malcolm McDowell's performance is over the top, no doubt about it.Alexander 'Alex' DeLarge is a vicious teenager in a violent future. At nights, he takes part in many repulsive events including rape and murder. However, after turning on his friends many time, they claim revenge and leave him to the police. Alex if forced to undergoe horrific experiments designed to brainwash him and remove his free will.I fail to understand why the film impresses many people, and it is likely that I will never."
1,No Masterpiece,"I'm not sure why I've given this movie one star. Perhaps it's because of McDowell's acting, which is good. When I saw the film in 1971 it made a big impact: 32 years later it says nothing at all. I'm not shocked by violence or nudity; it's just that it's a very poor work of art, empty of everything except design, ugly, repellent design. I'm beginning to think Kubrick must be the most overrated director of all time. As another reviewer has pointed out, his films seemed to get steadily worse and worse. And all of them have one thing in common: they are s-l-o-w. It seems to me that Kubrick was obsessive and dedicated, but just not very bright. He was also, apparently, intensely depressed about life. Still, it was clever of him to make such a big thing of these disadvantages. I suppose his films are worth seeing, once only. But after the first sensation of puzzled surprise, they just turn into hideously tedious sludge."
1,Junque,"Well, not really an accurate rating....As a movie it gets 5 stars, but as a DVD it gets 1. Nothing new here at all (""awards won"" does not count...this can be found anywhere). Worst of all, the box claims ""widescreen"" but it is not. A total waste of money if you own it on VHS."
4,3 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:A somewhat incohesive picture, A Clockwork Orange never takes time to illustrate what it really means (case in point: the title remains entirely ambiguous); that being said, however, it's interesting and daring enough to be consistently engaging even if the director skips over the message."
5,pointless movie,"indeed, this movie has no point or lessons to be learned as with just about every stanley kubrick movie. the man has perfected the art of speaking without saying anything. but i guess that doesn't really matter because the movie is just so good. a bad bad boy and his fellow droogies go around doing bad things until the lead droogie 'alex' gets arrested and eventually enlists in a special correctional program. the program works but not as expected, so they return little alex back to his old demonic self. what's the point? i don't know. it's just a very interesting movie. see it if you like sick stuff. there's worse than this, but no doubt this is rather weird. the movie has an impeccable sense of style and a very spooky feel to it. it's also worth noting that the tripped out acid piano renditions of beethoven are topnotch and i would love to find a soundtrack for this."
3,More like A Clockwork Tangerine!,"Some consider this to be Kubrick's masterpiece. In my opinion Dr. Strangelove was his masterpiece, but Orange is a master work, nonetheless. It's a dark tale of prophecy, a vision of a bleak future, violent and vicious in the extreme, which some might also say we're living in today, judging by the headlines.So this is a great movie, but this DVD is a great disappointment! Despite what the details above say and what it says on the disc snap-case, the film is not in widescreen letterbox format, but is in full screen format! And the image quality is only fair-to-good. The sound is OK on my mono TV speaker but evidently is not Dolby multi-channel. And the theatrical trailer freezes at various points during playback. There's a chapter index and a list of awards the movie won or was nominated for, and that's about it for bonus features! One can only hope that the next release of this movie on DVD will do it justice, and make it a true Kubrick collectible!"
2,?????????????,"I don't understand the greatness of this movie.It's hard tounderstand and seems to have no point whatsoever.Nothing reallybothers me about this film like rape,chessy clothes and sets,etc.The only thing that bothers me is that I can't seem to make it clear through because it is so boring. Maybe some good LSD would make it seem better."
1,GREAT MOVIE / HORRIBLE DVD (MONO!!),A terrible shame that one of the best movies of all time is released in such a rotten DVD transfer. BEWARE -- the description of this DVD hides that it is in MONO! I thought my DVD player was broken but eventually figured out this is a mono production -- using only the center speaker on most home theater systems. Even the mono has a lot of hissing.The original film depends on an awesome soundtrack that supports its tension and mood. I remember buying the soundtrack (one of the few times I've done this) when it first came out. The film's impact is all but lost with such poor mono sound. Don't buy this! Wait for a better DVD release.
1,"Disturbing and daring, but is it any good?","Disturbing, shocking, and daring are words that have been used to laud this film. But after so many years of ""artists"" trying so very hard to disturb and shock me, I would love to see someone use art to illumine or enlighten me. ""A Clockwork Orange"" is a product of its time, an ossified attempt to create profundity by merely disturbing and shocking the viewer. I would really like to think that the art world (not just film, but music, painting, and sculpture as well) is ready to get over its adolescent obsession with sex and violence and surrender itself to art's greatest strength -- to elevate humanity and celebrate all that is truly good and beautiful. I have seen many Kubrick films, and this is very close to being his worst."
1,only came with one disc,"i ordered the two disc-special edition of this movie and it only came with one of the discs. i would have been okay with that if the one disc happened to be the disc that had the movie on it. unfortunately, the one disc i did receive was the directors commentary and such. waste of time and money."
2,Violent.,"This movie is full of violence every 5 minutes and should not be viewed by anyone. The director of this film, who is now dead, was definitely on some kind of trip when he made this film. It is a total waste of film and should be destroyed. Don't waste your money or time ..."
4,You Reviewers really seem to overrate this film...,"It is a fantastic film with great Mcdowell acting and cineamatogrpahy but where is the story line.. it is out to prove nothing except that this is the ultimate future. Yes i have read the novel incase you nay-sayers get pissed off and beilve me to be closed minded with it well i've read it and i own a ton of Burgess novels and like Burgess said he wishes they would have done anohter one of this books becasue this one isn't his greatest and in the version of the book I have Burgess was dissapointed with Kubrick and his New York publisher. The book is much much better and has more of a story line but this is a great movie don't get me wrong but i don't think(seeing a review while typing this) that you're not a true ""punker"" if you dont see this..i guess punk rock isnt about ideas anymore if you have to see a movie to be one."
3,Okay,"This movie, in my opinion, is overrated. I probably would have liked it better had i not read the book first. There are a couple story changes, and it would have been better if Kubrick used the ""lost American chapter"" since it has a better ending.Another problem i have with the movie is a lot of unecessarry nudity.Therefore, i urge you to read the book instead of watch the movie."
1,The most overrated movie ever made,"Hideous, obnoxious, pretentious. Unforgivable defamation of Beethoven. Ugly looking sets, costumes, and people. Overwrought satire. Horrible, horrible movie, possibly the worst I ever saw."
1,My favorite film ruined by horrible mastering,"I own this on DVD and VHS. I saw it 14 times in theaters. I know what the film looks like. And Stanley Kubrick was notorious for his pathological compulsion to visual perfection. This Blu-ray looks like complete crap. The producers should be ashamed. What garbage can did they pull their master out of?Go buy the ""2001 A Space Odyssey"" Blu-ray instead, which was obviously put together by people who were technically very talented. Seriously."
4,"Not as good as the book, but still a very good movie by Stanley Kubrick.","The film is not as good as the fantastic novel. Mainly because they went a little overboard on the violence and sexuality. I give the film four and a half stars. I could say that this is close to being a classic. I liked they guy who played Alex's father better on The Shining. But still, Malcolm McDowell was born to play Alex he was perhaps the best actor in the film. Recommended to Kubrick fans."
5,Still a fantastic movie,"watched this movie for the first time about 13 years ago on VHS. and even after all this time, i still have the love hate relationship with Mr. DeLarge."
5,Hi hi hi little droogies!,"I just viddied it this noochy and I have to admit I was blown away with the image quality of this transfer; I just love this awesome piece of art and watching it in such way made me love it even more, extras are great, I took a glimpse of Malcolm as an old man today commenting on the movie and some lenghty documentary and that's all on the first disc, haven't even touched the second one; if you're browsing this is because you're a malchick looking for some advice and here it is: BUY THIS!"
5,Kubrick is Great,"I really enjoy all of the Stanley Kubrick movies, and I wish he was still around. This movie is a one of a kind, and a lot can be read into it, if one decides to do so. I really enjoyed this movie."
5,Crime and punishment.,"I agree with everyone else when I say this movie is not sick and perverted, or violent. The whole basic main idea, theme, or lesson is crime and punishment, you get what you deserve. I am also a big fan of classical music, which I am glad to say is in this. The whole movie might be considered ""shocking"", but I agree with the viewer who said it was ahead of its time. You have to look past all the violence and raping to understand the symbolism. After viewing, get a bit of the ol' ultraviolence. This movie will take your breath away!"
5,A Masterpiece!!!! A Must-Own Movie,"A Clockwork Orange... I did not like this movie the first time that I saw it...I must admit that. I gave this movie another chance, however, and found it to be hypnotizingly stimulating. This movie is truly a work of art and a masterpice in itself. Kubrick is a genius."
4,A Great Adaptation of an Excellent Book.,"I've seen my fair share of movies made from books. Not many of them hold up. A Clockwork Orange does. Of course, there are some discrepancies, as can be expected, and I'm still divided on whether or not it would have been better with the 21st chapter, which of course completely changes the end. However, this is definitely one of the best book to movie interpreteations I've ever seen. Aside from that, the acting is excellent, and the whole movie is intrigueing. Do yourself a favor: see the movie AND read the book. This is one where I don't think reading the book will ruin the movie for you, as is many times the case."
4,"Great movie, buy the newwer disk","Great movie, but buy the newwer disk. The version I ordered is in mono, I'd prefer to listen to the Wendy Carlos in surround."
5,Clockwork Orange...,What a movie. If you havent seen this movie yet you are missing out. Watch it!!! Its a classic cult movie.
4,Bizzare Masterpiece,"Probably the most bizarre movie I have ever seen but a very good movie. Stanley Kubrick directs this masterpiece. About a gang of teenagers who spend their nights terrorizing people, raping women, and beating people to death. Very, very strange, yet very creative. This is not a movie for everyone."
5,A clockwork orange is the best!!!,"This is the best movie in the world to watch while you are stoned. Everything makes since, and you can laugh for hours. All the stuff in the movie made since, and it was stuff that I think about, but never could express. Im glad someone made and directed this movie."
5,A WORK OF ART,"After almost 30 years it still marvels and some what shocks anybody who views this masterpiece. I have seen this movie a zillion times and it seems as entertaining as the very first time. Not for everyone I must admit but given the chance to view it, you will not be able to get those images out of your head. Kick back and loose yourself in a bit of the old ultra-violence."
1,Stupid,"For the life of me, I can't figure out why this movie gets such ratings. I'm an avid movie watcher without particular tastes. Will watch just about anything even if I've read the book & not judge according to original stories. This movie just plain sucks, but because it was written by someone of notable existence & in '72 I think, he must have been ahead of his time, right? ~ NOT! It sucked when I tried to watch it 25 years ago when I walked out of the theater & it sucked even more when I watched it as an adult nearly a decade ago now."
1,Trash.,"This movie was pure and utter trash. You will be offended and shocked by this films violence and portrayal of rape, and religion. I cut it off after the first 15 minutes or so. I couldn't pollute my mind any further with this junk. There are other great Kubrick films out there. Pick from one of those and leave this one to the dogs."
1,stupid movie,That was a stupid movie with too much violence and sex. The violence served no purpose and this movie is proof that hollywood thinks they can make crappy movies and call it artistic. What a waste of film and time.
1,Wow...looks as if someone went downhill...,"The Shining, Full Metal Jacket, and parts of 2001: A space odyssey. These are some greats from Stanley Kubrick. I was surprised when I saw his name on the credits for this movie. It is one of the worst movies I've seen. It is just plain stupid. Don't waste $20 on this! Go see anything Tarantino or Tim Burton. The only good part of this movie was the first scene, then it all went downhill."
1,A Clockwork Orange,This movie is the worst watse of two and a half hours. I've seen better reform movies than this hunk of s**t!
1,"Eh, I was hoping for more.","I heard this movie was originally rated X, so of course being the rebel I am, I decided to go and watch it. Man, was I disappointed or what! I was expecting a risque movie. Instead it was an ""artistic"" movie with only about ten sex scenes. I was expecting hot stuff! I was robbed, I tell you. This movie is overrated cal. You guys only like it because you feel smart trying to translate the funny language they use. Stanley Kubrick is lame, watch some Uwe Boll instead."
2,Maybe brilliant in its day--but not today!,"While A Clockwork Orange may have been a brilliant portrayal of society's ills and problems when it was produced, I don't see it. On the contrary, it reminds me of modern day productions such as South Park and Beevis and Butthead. While they may be satirical in nature and very thought provoking as to society's problems, A Clockwork Orange simply seemed to be portraying sex, drugs, violence, mental illness, and corrupt governmental institutions just to be doing it without any reasoning. Again, when it was first released it may have had some social significane, but it just seemed to be stereotype after stereotype without significance."
2,What's the big deal?,"Maybe its because I'm a latecomer to seeing this movie. When it was released it may have well been groundbreaking; but in 1999 it's just plain weird. It comes across as pretentious and absurd. While there are clearly brilliant scenes, as a whole the movie is little more than an attempt to shock and offend. Those are admirable elements within a movie but insufficient to suppply its foundation."
5,A Great Movie,"This movie is brilliant. Visually it is unique, the music selection (mostly Beethovern) is powerful, and the philosophical themes of the movie really will make you think. To me, this is more than just a great movie though. Its a scientific experiment on the audience. As the audience watches A Clockwork Orange, they are seduced into numerous violent scenes, each beatifully orchestrated by Kubrick. Are we all prone to view violence with pleasure rather than sickness? I think the movie proves the affirmative. Chilling."
2,two oranges,"When I first saw this film, I was an adolescent, and I enjoyed it. But now that I'm all grown up, I feel that A Clockwork Orange is empty, and it was probably made for people who don't have a lot going on ""upstairs"".Just look at the people you meet in your life who quote this film. Are these people that you admire? If so, maybe you will like this film.But don't be fooled. A Clockwork Orange has nothing to do with clocks or oranges. It is about friendship and betrayal. The main character ""Alex"" is betrayed by his friends the ""droogies"".Spoiler alert:I'm giving this film a two star rating (instead of one star) because it does have a happy ending. In the end, Alex is successfully rehabilitated. So it gives us hope that doctors in the future will be able to cure people more effectively than they do today."
2,This Movie is absolutely Overrated.,"I use to read for a while before buying any Stuff, So I think I usually make the right choice...But not with this one. This movie is totally overrated and weird. The characters, the music, etc., I was thinking what kind of people would enjoy this movie?. I think sadism and madness are not a good movie topic (in most times). If you watched Natural Born Killers and you liked it, I think you will enjoy this one too, but if you hated it (as me) you will hate this one even more. I consider myself as an open mind about movies, I enjoy very different genres but I don't get why anyone could enjoy movies like this one. If you want to compare your movie ""taste"" with mine, my preferred movies are: Sixth Sense, The Matrix, Saving Private Ryan, Forrest Gump, Men of Honor.....if you think your taste is like mine...STAY AWAY FROM THIS MOVIE."
1,Repulsive,"My class had to watch this movie, and half of us think it's disgusting while the other half thought it was a masterpiece. Well, personally, I thought it was repulsive. The violence and nudity were nothing less than shocking. I'm not blaming Kubrick, it's just how the story goes. After watching 30 minutes of it, I had to turn off the TV."
2,Condition Not New!,"This product was listed as ""New"" but was not. The case was open and the DVD was used as evident by the scratches. As a warning, don't believe what is described."
3,HD Versus Static DVD,I made mistake of not actually knowing what a HD-DVD was. Assumed it was regular DVD which it is not. In the future I will look into the product with a little more time being invested in what it actually is. I assumed my New 2010 Laptop would play it. Umm nope. So purchasing this item was a learning experience for me. Will look forward to using it with my next Laptop that will play HD and or Blueray Disc DVD's.
1,Too ridiculous to be taken seriously.,"This movie was far too enigmatic and incoherent to string together. The music lent itself well to the story, yet one that is laughable. I believe that somewhere in its inner recesses lies a meaning as profound as in 2001, but I could not allow my self to see beyond the silly sets, costumes, and actions. Any movie filled with characters who have purple hair and wear their underwear over their pants is not a good one, even if it was directed by Stanley Kubrick."
1,Marketing Overdose,"What a waste. This masterpiece of cinematography gets ravaged by the Warner Brothers Marketing Department. My complaints: 1) more of the same ""The Making Of"" featuring anyone and everyone that's seen the film throwing in their two cents, 2) William Friedkin appears unfortunately giving us his take on the film (I wish he would make more films instead of commenting. He's a GREAT director), 3) extra disc offers nothing, 4) lousy packaging, 5) and the worst travesty, different font design from the original identifiable film artwork A CLOCKWORK ORANGE logo and the cropping of the Korova Milkbar girls nude breasts. WTF?"
3,you have to see this,"If you haven't read the book, this movie is probably greeat. but if you have read the book youre setting yourself up for a dissapointment. It totally misses the message of the story and focuses on the rape aspect so much more than the violence which is much more important. Basically, this movie pales in comparison to the book. Kubrick made some major mistakes but his vision of the way everything looks is inspiring. i would suggest this movie to those of you who havent read it. It is a movie you need to see either way."
3,"Great movie, poor transfer to HD","One of the top films of all time, yet the high def release (Blu-ray and HD-Dvd) is a big disappointment. Older transfer in standard def DVD looks sharper, and the film looked much better on the HDNet Movies Hi-def channel. This is a real disappointment, as most high def titles look far superior to standard DVD's. Warner should apologize and fix this with a better transfer. It is not a problem with this being an older film; it has looked better and should look really good on Hi-def disc, but this is not the case here."
5,The mental rape on a rapist by society,"Society seeks to control the essecence of people via mind control using behavior modification techniques of adversion theraphy.Are we so far from this film's message? Just watch the coverage of our evening news and the producer's of what we have now the blending of ""news"" and entertainment,brought by the good folks of the liberal community!"
3,its missing something,"The white version of this movie is missing at least one valuable scene(the murder scene). If you want the true effect of the movie, then I suggest that you find a better version. Without this scene, some of the story is missed, like how he got caught."
5,"Stop, masterpiece!!!","A clockwork orange is the masterpiece of the modern art: is original, strange and very exciting. And also the Kubrick's masterpiece and his vision of the contemporary society. Alex is bad, i know, but his violence is natural, on the contrary of his non-violence, that is mechanic, like the orange, symbol of cokney's minds. I don't understand who wrote that A clockwork orange is not a masterpiece and is sick like Kubrick, it's pure madness!!! Kubrick was not only a filmaker, but was also a visionary and he touched every way of the human's conception. His films are a strange miscellaneous of excellent direction, good acting and straordinary perspicacity. Stop world... Alex is back!!!"
5,PLEASE See This for the Right Reasons!!,"Many folk view this tale of futuristic dystopia to live vicariously through the bizarre lifestyle of the protagonist Alex (Malcom McDowell).I've seen the 'Alex' Halloween costume several times (even on Bart Simpson), I've seen more than one ""Clockwork Orange"" tattoos and almost everyone I bring discuss the film with will respond with a verse of ""Singin in the Rain"", a song sung by Alex in a particularly disturbing scene in the film.""A Clockwork Orange"" is far more than a hedonistic kill/steal/rape-fest, it is a social commentary about several themes, most importantly the freewill of man and the role of government in changing that will, regardless of how repugnant their behavior may be.See this, if you must as a film about thoughtless violence and excess. But be ready to ask questions of yourself and your society about what is rehabilitation, what is independent thinking and if evil does exist."
4,A Humble Opinion,"The movie is an obvious and an undeniable classic. It is an absolute must-see for anyone. Granted, it is a bit strange and very raw and blunt at times, but you have to remember that it is a Kubrick film. The only minus is that this DVD has no special features."
3,Artful But As Fun As Going Nuts In A Padded Room,"I see the artistic value of this film, but I found the depiction of violence and rape as an art form truly revolting. There are good issues here, though. Can criminals ever be reformed? Personally, I think they shouldn't have reversed Alex's treatment. He deserves not to enjoy sex or violence anymore. I like the ""Indy 500"" sex scene, too. The William Tell Overture will never seem the same again."
5,The best in ultra violence,"If you have never seen this movie, PLEASE do. You won't regret it. Even though it was made in 1971 it has not lost any of the horror, humor, ultra violence or message. There is nothing dated about this movie, I wonder if Kubrick planned it that way. I far surpasses any movie on this particular subject that has been made since, really. Malcom McDonald should have won an Academy Award for his performance, he was perfectly cast."
5,The best opening scene ever and more.,"When I first saw this film, I was shocked, delighted and wanting to see it again.First, the opening scene which is my personal favorite opening scene in any film, watching Malcolm McDowell's face staring at you between madness and mockery, between hate and insanity.The whole visual aspect of the film is brilliant, the clothes, the houses, the car...the Korova milk bar...I was just amazed.This film is not for the sensitive eye, it has strong sexual content and violence...but what a way to use classical musical during these two R rating aspects, Kubrick is a genius.I didn't think I was gonna be so surprised and thrilled from a movie that is more than thirty years old...you have to know how to appreciate classics.A definitive must-watch film that deals with the evil in society and the conception of the human soul through some great visuals, some perfectly-developed characters and a powerful story."
3,Read the book as well!!,"For those who already commented on the DVD who hadn't read the book or perhaps those who have no idea about the last chapter in the book... The book was released with in Europe with 21 chapters like the author intended.. yet released in America with only 20 due to the idea that Americans would see the last chapter as too ""happily ever after""... Unfortunately for this- Kubrick based the movie on the American version of the book therefore leaving out a great aspect of the story which detailed as Alex finding his place in the world and realizing a new maturity in which violence was no longer needed in his life. So though the movie did prove to be a great attempt at a very amazing yet difficult piece of liturature.. it didn't seem to justify the book. Of course.. how many books can you read where you must interpret every other word."
5,Absurd as well as freshly disturbing,"ON the DVD aspect, I always expect more from a DVD and always receive less than expected. Give me interviews, give me angles, give me a seperate audio channel where I can listen to Wendy Carlos banging on her Moog!!!!As for the film itself - Absurd as well as freshly disturbingI love you Kubrick...RIP"
4,A Clockwork Orange,"After reading several reviews of this wonderful flick I have concluded that the reviewers that disliked it are either unaware that is was a satire or don't know what a satire is. A satire is a "" An artistic work in which human voice or folly is attacked through irony, derision, or wit."" ( American Heritage Dictionary) Both this movie and the book were done as a satire of the humam race and government control. I will agree that the violence is graphic but that adds to the movie and tells its story better. This is most certainly not a movie meant for everyone. I would suggest that people read the book before they read the movie so they can understand what Anthony Burgess and Stanly Kubrick were trying to do."
5,Splendid Eye Candy,"This movie was, well, absolutly wonderful!! The artwork in it was funny as well as tastful. I enjoyed how the ""demented"" man did all his wrong deeds in the night (rape, stealing,etc.) then went home to mummy and daddy. I would recommend this to anyone that has a good eye for taste and originality."
4,"Long time, no see.","Been a while since I saw this movie (30yrs).Forgot how violent it is. Had me stunned for a moment or two.The props are somewhat old fashioned, but the style, story, acting, soundtrack and photography is superb. The BR transition is not to bad.A collectors item well worth the money."
2,Disturbing,"I watch movies to be entertained and to feel GOOD. I do not associate good feelings with sadness, fear, and psychotic episodes. This film is disturbing and unsettling and left me feeling the need to be medicated.I understand why this is a cult classic. We share this world with many disturbed people. Considering the film was released in 1972, I am certain this film, as many of today's movies attempt to, pushed the social boundaries of what could and should be done.The film is very artistic, but not ALL art is GOOD art.I would recommend this film to an enemy or a narcholeptic.This is NOT a movie for the SOUND mind."
4,"Interesting, scary and bizarre","I read the book first, and then decided to watch the movie. It is a frightening and disturbing movie, and truthful about how perpetrators think, act, and justify their violence."
5,MAKES YOU THINK,"I have watched this movie a couple of times, mainly trying to figure out what it is about, but also because it is a great movie. Yes there is rape, sex, violence, and ""ultraviolence"", but there is obviously deeper meaning to this film, I have yet to figure it out but I suspect that may be just the reason it is a cult favorite-it will stick with you after you watch it and will be talked about for generations to come."
3,A Clockwork Orange - Kubrick has done much better,"I recently saw for the first time Kubrick's A Clockwork Orange and really feel that he has done much better work. I know that I am going against the flow on this one but this movie was just not what I expected. I rate it at three stars because of its technical quality, however, I can't see sitting through this film again and the experience improving one bit. In fact, I think it would be more painful to watch with each viewing. As always, I don't know what Kubrick was trying to tell us but I really don't think I will take the time to try to learn with subsequent viewings. This is the one and only Kubrick film I did not love!"
4,Good job,I am very pleased with the product I received. It was given as a gift. He too was pleased with the movie.
1,Not for the faint at heart.,I saw this movie in the winter of 1991 and was probably seven months pregnant at the time. I found it to be one of the more upsetting movies I've ever seen; and I've seen a lot of movies. This type of film would attract persons of an anti-social nature and was so difficult and strange to follow. I don't recommend it to anyone and don't think its appropriate for anyone under 18.
2,THIS WILL MAKE YOU THINK,"I AM 22 AND FOR ABOUT 7 YEAR I HAVE HEARD PEOPLE TALK ABOUT THE CLOCK WORK ORANGE MOVIE, I HAD BEEN DESCRIBED PARTS OF THE MOVIE AND WAS VERY INTERESTED BY THE MOVIE.ONE I HAD FINISHED WATCHING THE MOVIE I FOUND THIS TO BE BIZZAAR, BUT YOU CAN SEE THAT IN ITS DAY IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A VERY GOOD MOVIE.PREWARNING:- BE PREPARED FOR RAPE AND VIOLENCE AND IF YOU LIKE THE SONG 'SINGING IN THE RAIN' IT WILL CHANGE YOU VEIW ON THE SONG FOREVER.BUT IF YOU HAVENT SEEN IT I WOULD RECOMMEND TO DO SO."
2,Twisted.,"A Clockwork Orange is one sick piece of cinema art. First off, I have to congratulate Malcolm McDowell for his twisted and genius performance, didn't know he had it in him. The problem with this film is the grotesque nudity and violent rape scenes, less is more. Stanley Kubrick was a good director but he always had the same formula, show more skin. This film is just too trippy for me, but hey if you're into that then you will love this film."
2,Hasn't aged well...,"I just saw this movie for the first time on a large screen with a good print. Unfortunately, I don't think it's especially good. I have no problem with either sex or violence, but the way these are used in this movie seems juvenile and tedious. The sensibility that pervades most of it seems more like that of a 14-year old boy than a mature, acclaimed director. Perhaps in 1971 the repetitive ""hooliganism"" episodes and schoolyard-level phallic props were seen by audiences as amusing and even daring but in 2009 they just look a bit pathetic. Probably it was a lot of fun to make the film, but most of the humor feels really dated and the relentless misogyny wears thin really quickly. 2001 and Dr. Strangelove are much better movies, I think."
1,Astonished,"Other reviews of Clockwork Orange tell me that I do not like the film because I do not ""get it"" or because I am close-minded. Some of the writers insist that the film has value because of the social commentary it contains, or because it is thought-provoking, or because of its enduring relevancy, or even because of its exceptional cinematography. Nonsense. None of these things justify the dehumanizing brutality of this film. I am not a better human being for having seen the film, and I have not been entertained by it (I would be too ashamed to admit it if I had been)."
2,Philosophy 101,"I really hate to rain on the parade, but feel moved to write a review as an ""average viewer."" That is, I saw the film during its theatrical release, when I was 19; and I was unaware of any controversy surrounding the film, as I lived far from any ""cultural center."" (I was in Arkansas, actually.) This was the Vietnam era. I was a war protester, cultural misfit, and acidhead. My reaction to the film was, and is, one of boredom. That's not to say that there aren't some good bits: McDowell's Alex is an engaging screen character. But to speak of ""social commentary"" or ""philosophy"" in this film is to reveal an ignorance of the perfectly common and ordinary statements of bygone literary figures introduced to my generation (and, hopefully, others) in high school at latest. The film looked cheaply made in 1972, and that look has only worsened with time. If you want pop philosophy with a (relatively) good look, try _Brazil_ instead."
1,I'm not allowed to see this film,"It's a shame that Kubrick obviously felt we British aren't responsible enough to see A Clockwork Orange. Out-dated censors I can understand , but a ground breaking film director? Not good."
3,Damaged,"An ok movie that was a disappointment relative to the hype. Very violent.HD DVD Image 3.5 stars, Audio 3.0 stars.HD DVD Copy I received was damaged. Since I destroyed my receipt, I could not send back for replacement."
1,I'm Siding With Alex!,"When it comes to this film, I really have to side with Alex. After all that violence and nudity, I think I'm going to be sick....."
4,Good series,"This formulation of DVD looks to be a series about films made by Stanley Kubrik, as coincidentally I also got the bluray version of 2001 a space oddessy and the Shining. The extras are nice even tho the layout of the main menu leaves something to be desired. All in all a very good purchase"
5,great movie my droogs,"God I love this movie! I watched this,finally,two nights ago and pigged out on chex mix that I made. The only thing I didn't care for was on the second disc there was no indication as to how long the interviews and what not were, so what I thought was going to be a quick interview with Malcolm ended up being an HOUR! I'm not one for sitting there hearing someone talk for an hour, sorry. I decided to skip the ""how to"" since I didn't want to nod off."
4,Definitly a classic that you can watch over and over,I would suggest reading the synopsis before watching the movie. Once you know the back ground it's an interesting story inside the mind of a incurable killer. The disk made it's way to Colorado in 2 days and in primo condition.
5,One of the greatest films ever created,"Disturbing and shocking, but a landmark film that you must see and you really should own."
5,A Dream-like State of Awe,"This film is one of the best works I have ever seen. The story is about a youth named Alexander DeLarge, who is obsessed with crime. While, the film may contain alot of nudity and more than its fair share of violence its done in such a way that you cant help but love it. Although, I think the book was better this movie is sure to please those who liked the book. The only problem I had with it was it left out how Alex grows tired of his violent ways. This movie will leave you with a feeling words cant describe. It shows you that a person can be completely evil yet you will still feel compasion for the character. My review can not do the movie or the book justice, so if you have not already I beg you buy this movie."
2,a very uneven movie,"Even though there were occasional brilliances, I kept asking myself why so many people found this movie great. I found the story very incoherent and everything was excessive. It was full of overacting and overdirecting. There are some stories to which movies just can't do justice. I'd rather read the book than watch this movie version. I think people should stop justifying this film only because Kubrik made it."
5,A brilliant case study of violence and human nature.,"This movie is the best example of what a brilliant director can do with a brilliant script. Everything fits perfectly. Burgess at his best, kubrick at his best. A masterful examination of violence and human nature. It entertains as well as educates. The late director mixes gloriously pictures and music. Brilliant performances by everyone. It is obscene but never offensive. It is profane but never vulgar. It is art, psychology and prophesy together. Best seen and not talked about. Buy it, watch it, treasure it."
5,DVD is 1.66:1,"The format of the DVD is 1.66:1 which is the original format Kubrick intended. This is a very shallow letterbox which is hardly noticeable. Not all movies are 1.85:1. Also, the point of DVD is ultra high quality non-degradeable video... not to put a lot of extras. Extras are nice but lack of them is no reason to rate down a movie of this caliber."
3,not again...,"I will only say that while I can appreciate the artistic and social aspects of this piece, merely the THOUGHT of watching this film again makes me nauseous. I saw this film when I was about 11, on a cable channel. The effect that the violent rape scenes had on me still haunt me to this day. I make this entry simply to warn anyone who is sensitive to violence. The film makes a powerful statement but you must be willing and prepared to be shaken to the very core of your soul and disturbed as you've never been by a film. I can NEVER watch this film again."
4,Really Good Coffee,I really enjoy this coffee. I think it has great taste for being decaf. I will definatley buy this again.
5,GREAT TUNERS!,I had been researching different tuners before i made a buy. These are the perfect build and weight IMO. They balance out my LP and keep it in tune. Would definitely buy again for other guitars.
4,A nice upgrade,I installed these on my Gibson Les Paul about 6 months ago.They are easy to install.If you know how to replace strings and can turn a screw driver you can install these yourself.
4,Performed as advertised,Received the product quickly with PrimeServed me well I have used on my car and I also have a golf cart I use around the house with 6Volt Batteries works just fine
3,gems ripped from settings,"Stan the Man, the greatest Jazz saxophonist of all time, The Sound, recorded more albums with Verve than any other label. Also labels that Verve eventually bought out.I have this album and I have Vol 1, too. And nearly all the albums these songs were taken from. While these are good performances of good songs, there seems to be something lacking when these gems are ripped out of their original settings. Works well as an intro or survey to albums you may not have, but songs like Corcovado (Getz/Gilberto), East of the Sun, and Rustic Hop have more feeling when listened to in the context of the original album as Getz intended.so I can't get excited and give it a higher rating than this."
3,Excellent Overview when combined with Volume 1,"Stan Getz was a noted jazz performer, not a composer. This collections of standards is a great overview of his talent when combined with Volume 1. Especially noteworthy are the Bosa Nova cuts like ""Corcovado."""
1,Too short,"These need to be longer by .5 to 1""...my subwoofer is almost flat on the floor. The spikes need more length and more threads."
5,Bon Jovi's Debut Is Great,"Bon Jovi's self-titled debut is a great CD. It stands head and shoulders above most hard rock records of 1984. The opener, ""Runaway"", was a single recorded with session players, but the rest of the CD features the full band. Jon Bon Jovi's belief that the young Australian tourist jailed in Indonesia since 2005 for drug-smuggling was unjustly convicted makes BON JOVI an essential purchase for both your ears AND your conscience, even if it IS a bit bubblegum compared to the band's best work."
2,Simple Review,"Highlights: Runaway (of course), She Don't Know Me, Come Back. Lowlights: Roulette, Brakeout. The rest just being ok. Great instrumentally, I just find the songs lacking in lyrical content. I know every other rock song at the time had about as much content."
2,The Original But Not their Best,Bon Jovi's self titled debut album contains nine tracks which are all right but with the exception of Runaway do not reach the musical heights of their later albums. You would purchase this album more for historical value if your fan of the greatest rock band of the 80's rather than for the actual songs on here. This album is where it all began and the tracks are not as substantial guitar wise or lyrically as the boys will achieve on their later masterpieces. Unless you are a huge Bon Jovi fan you probably will not want this album. Bon Jovi have created some of the greatest albums ever made and New Jersey and Slippery When Wet would be my recommendations if you do not own any of their albums at all and are looking to start.
5,Bon Jovi,"Bon Jovi's debut album didn't go golf or platinum, but it is my faverite Bon Jovi album. Songs like ""Come Back,"" ""Burning For Love,"" ""Runaway,"" ""She Don't Know Me"" and my faverite of all ""Shot Through The Heart"" really make the album for me. I think the band had a great influence from the legendary New Jersey hard rocker bad boy Bruce Springsteen. This album sparked a plug and helped Bon Jovi get the attention it needed. Good for the Jersey boys."
4,Decent Debut Effort,"Opening track Runnaway tells it all. It ended up #39 in Billbaord hot 100 chart in 1984. Japanese pop fans reaction,however, were enormous. Runnaway was used for theme song for Japanese school drama and a number of TV commercials such as instant cup noodle(you know ""All You Right"" sounds like ""Is hot water all right?"" in Japanese).Album is quite good with full of upbeat and solid rockers with the exception of She Don't Know Me. Breakout, and Burning For Love are outstanding among them. Burning For Love is early Loverboy styled pop rocker. Loverboy was one of their inspired bands. John Bon Jovi later duets with Mike Reno in Loverboy's Notorious.Essential for debut album collectors and Bon Jovi fans. Also Loverboy fans will enjoy their rock a lot. Oh, I didn't know Richie Sambora(disguised as woman in album coverart) has such nice legs."
1,Totally worthless,The P164 Circular Polarizer filter I received is totally worthless. The diameter is larger than the slots of the P series filter holder. It will not go into the holder. I am totally disappointed. I would have rated it 0 if I could have.
5,Luther,"Awesome. Go see it. Does not present the whole gospel or all the biblical influences of Luther, but good portrayal of personal integrity, and the hard choices and sacrifices that were made on our behalf. Acting good, the movie is riviting for the 2 hrs - when it was over I wasn't finished."
3,Almost there...,"Luther is a visual treat. Finnes is handsome and is able to bring out the passion Luther must have felt during that period of time, and the scenery and photography is wonderful. It made me want to study the actual life of Luther as written in history. The only problem with the movie is that if you didn't know about Luther's life before watching the movie, it would be very confusing. It would be good to watch an earlier film on Luther and read about him before watching this film so as to know who these people were in real life."
4,Good Movie.,"Joseph Fiennes does a good job playing Martin Luther that wrote the 95 Theses which made people rebelle against the Catholic church's teachings. Making & scaring people to buy indulgencses to abtain salvation to go to heaven. Luther writes that salvation is from Christ alone & it can Not be earned, only accepted.I recommend this film for people to watch.**Watch a great documentry DVD filmed by PBS titled 'Empires: Martin Luther'."
4,Good Film,"If you really want a good sense of what Martin Luther went through, fighting the Catholic Church, and bringing truth to Christians, buy this movie. Excellent movie!"
4,A beginners look,"Growing up a Roman Catholic, never being exposed to other religions I had become curious on the reformation. Over a period of time I researched the causes and the main person behind the reformation. This movie gave a good video version of Martin Luther's reasoning for his split with the catholic church. A professional job all around and tells the story in a simple format easy for most to grasp and be entertained by the story."
4,accurate to history,Accurate to history. Great depiction. Although did not detail the 95 theses and why he took out 7 books from old testament that does not support his doctrine. Books that exist and Christ refers to during his days. This purchase was actually my third one as one was a gift to a friend and the first my brother wished he had one...
4,the drunken monk,"This film, directed by Eric Till, should not be confused with the 1973 film of the same title and starring Stacy Keach as Luther. Both are based upon the play by John Osborne. Like its predecessor, the 2003 film received modest reviews, but given Martin Luther's (1483-1546) importance as the father of the Protestant Reformation, perhaps historical importance rather than cinematic success will earn this film some kudos at least among believers."
4,Luther was Anti-Catholic,"First off - anyone who has stuidied church history (no, I'm not referring to the revisionist garbage being promulgated) knows that Martin Luther, was Anti-catholic. He started out as Catholic monk, who discovered for himself, that salvation is NOT through the Roman Catholic Church, Mary, the Pope, good deeds, etc...rather, through placing one's faith in what Jesus Christ did for us on the cross. This is what marked Luther as a ""heretic"" to the Roman church. Sadly and ironically, our society sees and ""lumps"" all of Christianity into a ""Catholic"" wrapping. Catholocism never has, and never will be Christianity."
1,very disappointed,"It surprised me how lightly the film treats the most important event in the history of the Christian religion. Nothing is said about the deepest thoughts of Martin Luther, nothing about his writings nor the famous 95 theses he nailed to the door of the Wittenberg Church. Why were they so well received by the people? What was the meanings of them? Why are they considered the start of the reformation? It hardly shows the importance of the invention of printing in the spreading of Luther's movement.What is the importance of having a Bible written in German? I missed this and many other topics in the film. It is not a matter of telling facts, it's a matter of introducing people into the mind of a man and the period where he lived. Of understanding why things happened, not in a caricaturist way, but in a real and human sense.It's just a very bad film about something we could have learned a lot."
2,My mess up,I got the correct movie but not the right format I guess I was not looking when I order figured only dvds were being sold now but I got a VHS not happy had to send it back lost money since i had to pay for shipping.
5,Well Done Production,"I am sure that exegetes on the life of Martin Luther will find plenty of historical details on which to quibble; but I found this movie both beautiful and fascinating. The cinematography was a feast for the eyes. On the intellectual side, I was intrigued by watching the evolution of a terrified law student into a timid priest and his eventual transformation into a confident scholar and reformer. A few scenes are perhaps over-played to concisely move the plot along (e.g., Alfred Molina as the Pope's champion fund raiser)...but all in all, a fine film."
3,"Could Be Better, but Inspiring Nonetheless","I saw this advertised on the Web when it first came out, but could not see it in the theaters. Being very familiar with the story of Luther, I greatly anticipated its release to DVD.There is much of the drama one would expect from a story about a man who altered the course of history. His spiritual struggles, devotion, and courage all come out clear. The problems are with some of the parts which are over-dramatized. His wife is not faithful to history - Katherine was much younger than Luther and not as bold as portrayed in the movie.I would recommend it, but would also recommend the old 1950's version, as well as reading ""Here I Stand"" by Roland Bainton before viewing this version. That will help the viewer keep things in a more accurate historic perspective."
2,"Stagey, ""Bible film"" melodrama","I rented the movie because of a review that led me to believe the movie would educate me and provide some nuance. It's not in any way that kind of movie. Rather, it's a devotional treatment, appropriate for a Protestant religious family looking for a wholesome movie for a holiday. The opening scenes show young Luther to be so pious and important that even straightening his shirt is accompanied by pious grimaces and an entire string section. Every word out of Fiennes' mouth is delivered more hammy than a Hamlet monologue. The movie settles down into a predictable heroism (nothing extraneous to his religious bravery gets a line): all the Catholic Church is full of corrupt meanies who know they're corrupt, and every peasant cheers Luther on. It's a nicely staged Bible type movie, full of all the usual cliches, but it's about as interested in a nuance as Luther was interested in an indulgence."
3,Luther Splits Christendom.,"This movie presents a somewhat distorted modernized version of Luther, as radical, populist, rebel, and ""man of the people"". In fact, Luther allied himself with the Germanic princes and was a nationalist. Luther's reforms were conservative, calling for a return to the Bible against the excesses of Renaissance humanism. The movie shows very little of the darker side of Luther, a gloomy manic depressive who was prone to fanatical outbursts, antisemitism, and called his enemies foul names. Those in charge of the Roman Church at the time were not particularly interested in spiritual matters, nor in alleviating the suffering of Christ's faithful as the Gospels commanded them to do. However, Luther's revolution went too far, denying all authority to the Roman pontiff and splitting the church forever. Today, the rift between those who veered off in the direction of the Reformation and those who remained with Rome has become deeper than ever."
2,Well Made - Poor Historical Accuracy - Anti-Catholic,Plain and simple - this movie is Anti-Catholic and not only skips historical releavance but also changes it - to something that didn't even exist or happen.
5,Luther,"I rented this movie a couple of years ago and was fascinated with the history of the churches. After seeing it, I HAD to purchase some CD's for gifts. This is a fantastic movie, full of history, revelation, and adventure. Every Protestant and Catholic should see it!!!!!"
4,History Class Staple,"This a great portrayal of Luther and the beginning of the Protestant reformation. I teach children (highschool) who have never heard of Martin Luther (they always correct me and add King) nor the Catholic church, but this movie engrosses them and they come away with an understanding of Catholicism as a denomination, Luther and protestantism, and indulgences after watching (and they really watch) this movie. I use this movie every year when I get to the Protestant reformation."
3,Good movie,"This is a good movie but certainly not an in depth or 100% accurate at all times. I dont really fault any of the writers or producers for this because it has to be terribly difficult to try and fit everything in a 2 hour movie so obviously corners had to be cut, and thats fine. Its still a good movie that does offer a lot of truth about the man Luther."
4,Excellent movie,This movie was a rare treat. Well-written and very well acted. What a great insight into one of history's most important figures. Was worth the investment of time to find a copy of this.
5,MARTIN LUTHER,IT IS A GREAT MOVIE ON HOW THE CHRISTIAN REFORMATION CAME AND WHY IT WAS SO IMPORTANT IT DID COME.
4,Luther,"Very good movie! I wish there had been a bit more development into the historical context but alas!, a movie can only cover so much. Loved it. We tend to idealize the historical characters but this movie shows Luther as he was: both deeply loving God and tormented with his sins."
5,Luther starring Joeseph Fiennes,"This is the third Luther movie I have owned and I believe it to be the best. The other two were older productions.I have watched it at least a dozen times. It is historically accurate (according to R.C.Sproul's cd series on Luther),and I am moved by Luther's passion and courage.In my studies on justification by faith alone, it seems that this doctrine, the very crux of the reformation, is not actually emphasized as such in the movie. At Ligonier.org, I listened to the free teaching series on justification, Sproul noted that it took time for the reformers to actually identify the doctrine of justification as the central issue. Those many other peripheral issues that stem from differences on how they believed justification to occur, were much easier for them to identify; these were emphasized in the movie."
5,Luther,Saw the movie in the theatre awhile back and wanted to see again. It is very interesting - especially being a Lutheran.
2,disappointed,I ordered two copies of this video as I have seen it before and it is excellent.One copy was given as a gift and it does not play. :(I have not opened the second video to see if it works. Plan to do that today.How do I get a replacement?
2,OK but something is missing,"This film seems to have all the ingredients for an inspiring film but something is missing. If you purchase the 1953 black and white film ""Martin Luther"" (50th anniversary edition) you will see what is missing."
3,Only because the story needs to be heard...,"Don't expect to be entertained. The film does not try to be clever. It does not have the best writing. It merely gives a historically accurate (by spirit if not letter) representation of a man who by the grace of God, changed the way modern-day Christianity sees their God and their savior. While the filmmakers were diligent to see that this film be as accurate as possible, any created dialogue of course will purely be skeptical. Saying that, I could not see Martin Luther saying many of the lines that came out of him. The film also shows how Martin had the support of the people, but does not explain how that was brought about. If you're looking for entertainment, this probably isn't the film for you. If you sincerely want to find out more about the steps and process Luther took to begin the Protestant Reformation, there's probably no better place to start."
2,Terribly Inaccurate & Poor Acting,"I was highly disappointed when I saw how poorly portrayed Martin Luther was. The acting and directing were appalling and made it difficult to watch, but the departure from historical fact made it unbearable to keep watching. Pass on this one and look elsewhere..."
5,Great Movie!,Great movie. Very accurate to historical account. I would reccomend it to any one interested in the history or just looking for a great movie!
2,Too much sappy romance and not enough real drama. Lots of things in the movie went unanswered.,I love suspense but unfortunatly this just didn't quite live up to my expectations. Maybe I'm too used to seeing the mom in this movie as the wife of Jack Bauer in 24. I felt like this movie was more for teenagers. Too much sappy romance and not enough real mystery. I fast forwarded most of it just to get to the end. A lot of questions remained unanswered apparantly since the movie quit production after the last season. I was very disappointed with the ending. Their were too many parts of the movie that made absolutely no sense because the events just never got brought up again towards the end.
3,Different Cover,The book received has different cover than the imgage shown. A signature was on the back of the cover. Others are great!
2,"Also, interesting but weird","I was asked to read this book (along with several others from this author), by a friend. I am a Christian who holds a Biblical worldview and found this book to be interesting in many ways, but off the ,ark in some ways too. If you have a strong Bible background...you can sift the wheat from the chaff in this book and the Spirit will certainly speak through it. If not, I suggest you run from it and don't allow this into your head."
1,interesting to read the story of a charismatic Christian in Korea,nothing to write home about. Just the intro of his personal story was good.
1,Volume 2,"Nothing more, nothing new compares to the one. This book contains a lot of paranormal things about the dimension of holy spirit. This book is not fundamental to the readers. Not really insteresting because when you speak about the Word of God with such a personnal and subjective views of interpretation, nothing could be take for serious..."
4,This book a must to have!,Very helpful in building my prayer life. Agreat book to have in your study time with your Bible. Loved it.
3,Doesn't work with XP,"I'd love to tell you how much fun this game was, but I ordered it without looking closely at the package description. It will NOT work with Windows XP."
3,Dissapointing pictures & book,"Almost useless for AU and MS grade coins. Very, very small and poor quality b/w pictures of coins. Dissapointing as it could have been great if high resolution pictures were used and enlarged. Also, not including pictures of MS60-67 grades truely limits this book."
2,Good for the beginner,"If your a beginner at coin collecting this may be okay for you.This book has hard to view pictures ( not photographs ) of the coins being used as samples. This alone can confuse the beginner,as imperfections appear on the pictures and may be mistaken for the actual coin. The written descriptions and arrows point to too specific areas. The areas to be scrutinized are much broader than the head of the arrow. A better book for the beginner is HOW TO GRADE U.S. COINS by James L. Halperin.It uses a color code system that is much easier to follow and the pictures have much better detail. Also type coins for newer coins are NOT dicussed."
5,retief of the cdt by keith laumer,"This is one of the best books I've ever read. Retief is my faverite space hero. If you want to read a good science-fiction book read anything by Keith Laumer, no body does it better;and this is one of his best. It's none stop action and full of funny wit . You'll be guessing until the very end."
5,Soft and Heartwarming,"If you need to create a space to get away from it all, and already have a comfortable place to sit and some incense or candles, all you need besides that is this album. It lends itself well to meditation, yoga practice, tea ceremony, or just plain relaxation. Never cluttered, and never boring, it remains light and airy throughout, while also managing to be melodious and touching. Suitable for playing during a nice warm bath, or to help you drift off to sleep. Very comforting."
5,Breathing Spaces = Soothing Spaces!,"I first heard some of these songs on ""Soundscapes"" cable channel and fell in love with them immediately. I just had to have this cd and it NEVER grows old. This breath taking, soothing, instrumental Asian music is sooooo good for the soul, a round of this cd and you are refreshed! Love it, love it, love it!"
4,Terrific Chinese Music,"I love this album because it's so relaxing and romantic. Unfortunately, I don't have all the songs on my ipod because not only are some songs better than others, I have a very small ipod. I have Nocturne, Winter Sky, Leaves of Autumn, Water's Edge, and Tears of the Moon. These are very beautiful songs. I recommend this album to everyone."
5,Wonderful!,"My mom use to play this record during the seventies. Out of all Joan Baez's records, I remember this one the most! When Linda Ronstadt came out with her ""Canciones ..."", all I could think is how much she was following Joan. ""Gracias a La Vida"" is a recording of the old spanish songs sung around campfires, the stuff that is disappearing in the Southwest. I am glad to see this record is out on CD!"
4,"""Arise To Be Born With Me""","That's the first line of the 12th canto of Neruda's ""The Heights of Machu Picchu"". Baez's recitation (though slightly abridged) is brilliant. Her sensitivity, not only to words and rhythm, but also to that rare thing called ""cultural context"" make this album a stand-out.Recorded in the early 70's, Baez covers a number of traditional Mexican ballads, and goes much farther afield to tap other wellsprings of Spanish folk and traditional music. In particular, she explores the then-current Chilean ""New Song"" movement with Violetta Parra's joyous ""Gracias a la Vida"" and an exquisitely subtle and heartbreaking cover of Victor Jara's ""Te Requerdo, Amanda"". Even while singing in Spanish, she shows her mastery of both the emotional and political nuances of her material.This music is beautifully arranged and orchestrated, and Baez's voice was never better. Her choices of music bring in the full range of the joy, sorrow, and endurance of the human spirit.Gracias a la Joanie!"
4,Joan does Spanish Folk,I must say is there anything Joan can't do with that Soprano voice of hers? I really like the title song because Joan sings it like she means it and it touches you. I love Joan's music.
3,it's just okay,"I believe this product may either be for those who never workout, or perhaps elderly or weaker people (no offense!), because even at the third, greatest tension, it's way too easy. I would have to do TONS of reps to benefit noticeably. One problem I have encountered is that having to hold onto the handles, with my arms bent so drastically, for an extended period of time, and WITH tension being placed on my elbows' tendons REALLY makes my elbows sore, and I worry a bit if this will not cause long-term damage/discomfort. One suggestion, too, would be for them to place a rubber patch on the part that rests on the legs, because unless one has it a just the right position, the contraption tends to slip."
5,nice ring,Great quality and beautiful My girlfriend she likes the ring :)The price was very appropriate Thanks Gem Avenue Will re-purchase the products again
1,Looks very very fake,"I own a 1 ct. real diamond and puchased this ring for fun while my ring was being serviced. This ring is about 2.5- 3 carats. From afar, this ring may look real but it looks very fake close up. The setting is poorly constructed and looks like you'd get it from claire's. The stone is sparkly but the color looks like it is a cubic zirconia. I'm almost too embarrased to wear it because it looks so fake. For those reviewers that stated the ring was ""gorgeous"" and ""looks real"", they clearly don't have diamond experience. Maybe I'm a snob, but don't get his ring thinking it'll pass off as real. Think about it like this.... what you pay for is what you get. If you pay $18.99 for a ring, it'll look like an $18.99 ring."
2,Talk about an inaccurate picture!,The stone was far larger and the band far thinner than depicted. I opened the box and was very disappointed with what I found.
4,Beautiful Ring,"I absolutely loved this ring. The stone was gorgeous and even though the band itself was on the thin side, it was well done. My only reason for not giving it a 5 was that it was a little too big for my taste. It looks a lot bigger than 2ct. to me. I returned it for something a little smaller. If I was comfortable wearing something this size, It would have been perfect. I wish there were real photo posts for ever ring so we could see how it looks on someone's hand."
1,Waste of money,Ok so I wanted a ring that could replace my wedding ring till I could get a new one and fell in love with this one till it was sent to me. It looks like a dollar store ring! its cheap looking and I was very disappointed. The one thing that was good about this product is that it was in my mailbox within 2 days of ordering it!
2,Ok for the price,"This ring is ok for the price. Very light weight, band is very thin. Actually bent band by just taking off. Ok to wear to add a little bling. Wish it was better quality - I know, you get what you pay for. Looks like my 7 yr old niece is getting a new ring."
3,Holding up well.,"This ring can pass for white gold. The stone cleans up well and sparkles like a real diamond. The band is a bit thin but looks real. Has been worn doing dishes, showers etc. and no problems. Only complaint couple of the prongs go a bit sideways. You have to examine it closely to notice."
4,BlingRing,This is a very pretty ring with a gorgeous setting. It holds a lot of WOW factor. You get a lot of bang for your buck with this ring. It looks fairly real for a CZ. It is worth the buy!!
1,Don't waste your money.,"Don't waste your money on this movie, seriously. You can watch free on YT. When you see the cover you expect it to be a ""gangster"" movie, like American me or Blood in Blood Out, but it's not. I mean what kind of ""cholo/as"" do dance competitions? lol it's unrealistic! Nothing to real gang life, there it probably 1 gang conflict in the whole movie and it's in the end, 1 girl gets shot, and that's all the action you get. Don't expect much from this movie."
1,Not really an uplifting movie,Poorly filmed and bad acting is the best way to describe this B movie. I would avoid it if you can.
4,Living The Life,"Thia movie depicted the reality of what is going on in LA and in most parts of the world. Gangs are widespread and the violence is escalating because of the pressure put on others who want out of this kind of life. I like the characters in the movie, they seemed so gang like and the way they talk is how I see most latin gangs talk. A good movie."
4,"Based on ""Party Girl"" by Lynne Ewing","I read the book, I have been waiting a long time for this movie to come out, the book is great. I definately reccomend it."
4,I liked this movie,"I liked this movie a lot because the girls were hot and the story was really kind of serious too. Jay Hernandez was GREAT IN THIS MOVIE! Those girls learned some hard lessons and I know some girls like that. Plus, check it out, my friend was an extra in this movie and I read about the director in ESTYLO magazine, so I was very curious. If you like this style movie you might like it."
2,Overrated,"Well, I've read some other Alan Moore's graphic novels, such as V, Watchmen and The killing joke. I thought those were fantastic, very creative pieces of art.Then I read that the Courtyard will be finally available and that it's probably the best he has done, very intricate plot, blablablah and what do you know? my hopes went sky high.What I got was a short story, macabre, dense, nicely delivered, but that was pretty much it. The plot is very straight forward, it didn't impact me as much as I thought.Maybe I didn't get it, maybe I'm still expecting this to be a serie, with subsequent installments, maybe I need to be more Moore to understand the deepness.Right now I think it was a very expensive item for what I got."
2,Another failed attempt at adapting Cthulhu mythos,"This is something you cannot do. The Cthulhu mythos begins and ends with Lovecraft as far as I'm concerned. It's just not scary when anyone else tries it. Don't get me wrong I love Moore's earlier work. From Hell is the last thing he did worth buying and it could've benefited from major editing. If you're interested in Alan Moore check out Watchmen, V for Vendetta, or The Complete DR and Quinch. If you're interested in the Cthulhu mythos go for Lovecraft."
3,Informative,"This book is highly informative of technical details in Naqshbandi order practices. The author took great pains to unravel so many arabic, persian and urdu sources. But its not comprehensive, in the sense that it does not provide a consistent picture of the whole. The writing is haphazard and you need to have considerable background to read this book. Otherwise it takes one of the Pakistani shaykhs as a case study and goes into details of Naqshbandi practices, shaykh-disciple relationship, religio-social backgrounds etc. Surprisingly it did not cover, nor mention, any of the other lineages in India-Bangladesh, of the Mujaddidiya order. Good information but bad style of conveying it."
3,does this book include OnPoint systems student version -CD,"this book should has a CD, I will buy this book if it includes CD"
5,a treat,"It is an inventive album and I love to listen to it. The Rutabega's vocals are very sweet or mysterious, do you think?"
2,A tedious read with little objectivity,"There is no doubt that Mr. Jones thoroughly believed everything he wrote. He was a convinced believer in Hauptmann's innocence.However, there are three substantial problems with this book. First, it is a tedious read at best. The writer rambles incessantly and one cannot read this book for more than fifteen to twenty minutes at a time without taking a break or screaming. The book is about 150 pages too long.Second, there are enormous factual errors and inaccuracies throughout the book. Mr. Jones was clearly researching and writing with the express goal of finding Hauptmann innocent. Consequently, there is no objectivity.Finally, Mr. Jones has printed numerous rumors and tabloid tales from the 1930's and cited them as fact. The equivolent would be for a writer seventy years from now to claim that aliens visited the Earth during the 1990's based upon citations to the World Weekly News and other supermarket tabloids."
4,Excellent insight into the case and many questions raised,"While the author is redundant through-out the book, he has certainly brought to the public the oppor- tunity to look into the case of another ""trial of the century"". In taking the position that Richard Hauptman was wrongfully exicuted, Mr. Jones does show much evidence to demonstrate his claim, and I have been moved into the same opinion. The book is over 1200 pages, and at times tedious, but I found it to be well worth the time spent. Mr. Jones is into his eighties,and I think he should be commended for the accomplishment of his life's goal."
3,Prove it!!,"If any of the readers here have really found the system useful and practical, then please show me pratically how it works. I live california and would not mind joining any of you on your hunting day. email me @ piperguy_007@yahoo.com--Kash"
2,Doesn't work.,"Trust me, guys, this doesn't work unless you're a stud. It's all based on making ""eye contact"", and no girl is gonna be giving you 'eye contact"" unless you're an attractive stud. For the average joe, forget it, this just does not happen in real life."
2,"Good effort and concepts, but definately not THE system","I only gave this book 2 stars because it felt like a disspointment. Purchasing this book over the internet without looking through the book first at a local bookstore was a mistake. The System had a few good points, but on the whole it basically restates common facts like making eye contact, playing hard to get, and some basic psychology of women. When I first got the book I was surprised that it was so small; easily readable the first time through. Mispellings and typos also caught me offguard for a published book with such a distinguished ranking on Amazon. I wish there were more precise intructions/outlines for do's rather than dont's(ie. miroring a woman's bodylanguge). My advice to you is to skim through the book before you purchase it to see if its of value to you. I am considering purchasing The Art of Seduction by Robert Greene as a necessary follow-up."
1,Useful only to geek virgins.,"If you dated in high school or if you've ever had sex, this book will teach you nothing. It's like reading a gunnery manual written by pacifists. The ""System"" is boring, trite and useless."
2,This is the not the SYSTEM by Doc Love,"I purchased this book because I enjoyed reading Doc Love's articles on Askmen.com, however this is NOT his book. This book is more comical than of any practical use. To be honest, I would not try any of these techniques on women unless you are already very good with women."
3,Dont be fooled,Girls are of course going to be against the advice. They wouldnt want everyone to know how to get them with ease. They want to have the power and choice. Just because they say it wont work doesnt mean its true
3,Dont be fooled! A decent read,"I bought this book thinking it would help my game. Well I havent yet tried it , but his ideas are interesting. Meanwhile, the editing of this book is terrible, with tons of misspelled words. Other than that, the 1% rule has some merit. This book seemed stupid in that it really is just common sense ideas. I think you could try some of the stuff, and it will work, but alot is BS."
3,It's OK but...,"It's an OK book, but I have one major gripe with it: it has a lot of generalizations and not enough specifics in it. Like, it brushes over the topics without going into depth about them, as though it expects you to find half the information in that book elsewhere. I'd say skip this one, it's not worth the money + the shipping & handling. Because although it has some good ideas, you have to basically already be a playa in order to put them into practice. I, however, am not."
1,I don't get it,"It's actually a common sense...get muscular, be handsome....have a lot of money....blah."
3,Another average book on seduction,"I've read everything on the subject of seduction. SO its hard for me to view books as someone who is reading it for the first time. I've also read hundreds of articles on seduction and posted the best of them on my website The Seduction Bible. So lets just say, im educated. THat being said:This book is good if you've never read anything else. It's good if you don't want to spend the $40 it takes to purchase an E-book with more practical information. It does give you some great points in attitude, appearance, and general perspective of women. But it is missing the meat. It is missing the precise art of the mystery method. or the pure logic of cocky/funny.But then again... Like i said I've long since needed to read these books and now only read them to review for the readers of my site, the seduction bible.Bobby Rio"
4,Another great book on picking up women.,"This book should be added to your collection.There is a lot of advice here that isnt mentioned in other books and offers us guys more information we need to know.Its about time that women had to make an effort too.I learned a lot from this book.I highly recommend it to all guys.You can find more of these types of books.Search here under ""dating"",""how to pick up girls"" and ""how to pick up women"" on this site."
1,The System: How to get ripped off today!!,The entire contents of this book could fit on one page of paper.The remainder of the book is filled with art and babble. There's even recipes in the back (not kidding).Do not buy this book unless you want to learn first hand how to get ripped off today.
2,Boring Book; Common Sense,I was hoping that this book contained some useful theory on how to pick up more women but I was very disappointed with it. The suggestions contained are vague and boring. Reading it I felt like it was all common knowledge. There are some good points here and there but overall a poor book.
2,Don't waste your money..,"This book is only for the most shy,least confident and the most clueless with women men out there. I'll sum up the book for ya....Don't waste time on scoping for girls that don't make eye contact with you, they're not attracted to you. When you notice that a girl holds her stare and smiles at you or gives you a double look, charge on in for a conversation. Once in make her work for your attention, don't give it away that you're attracted to her. Once you're convinced she's into you, go for the score.....That's it...."
1,Will destroy your game...,"I picked this book up when i was beginning to get good with women. I had no theory or anything, i just did what seemed natural to me. I wanted to get even better so i picked it up and decided to do as it said. Whosh - game gone.First - this book tells you not to touch women. ANYONE good with women will tell you that touching, or Kino is the MOST IMPORTANT THING. It is VITAL. This book tells you the opposite. It's like telling somebody to go skydiving without a parachute. You're bound to crash.Second - it tells you ONLY to approach women who are staring at you. Anyone else isn't interested. This is SO WRONG. Almost as wrong as the first.Don't buy this book if you are planning to succeed with women."
3,nice book but don't believe everything it says,"This book is very small and easy to read, however nobody can seriously believe that you can get laid within minutes just following this method no matter how do you look like, how much money you have, etc as the author claim. I don't buy either that the author of the book has slept with even half of the girls he claims so easy. Let's be realistic here: you need to be good looking, funny, good conversation, dress nicely and a good car will help as well, no matter what method you use to close with someone in one night. Period.Having said that, The body language section of the book is really good and there are a few interesting ideas, like classifications, steps, non verbal communication, etc... some tools that can be used to try to understand a little bit better how women think. I agree with the author that many times women send us signals we can't understand and here we have a few ideas to decode them."
4,It probably is effective.,"It does seem to work, although I can't say it does without a doubt. I do feel more focused after listening to this, and I find myself coming to sudden realizations about things, seeing connections I hadn't before. Even when I'm not listening to it, at random parts of the day, I'll suddenly have a bit of insight that makes me feel like I understand things better."
5,it's as good as everyone's saying,"hey, if it's the placebo effect, then so be it... but this CD is great. after reading the great reviews on here, i had to give it a shot, and it's really as good as the glowing reviews! definitely use headphones. i've got a few other jeffrey thompson CDs and this is one of my favorites, for sure."
4,Buddha-Lounge,"Interesting combinations of music and songs. Somewhat up beat, not what I would call meditational music. More like you would expect in an upscale club scene. I enjoy it as background music while I'm working around the house or visiting with friends"
2,Buddha Buzz,"I bought this CD because I heard a song from it while having a massage. After I bought it, I soon discovered that there are only a couple of songs on the album that I really like to listen to. The name ""Buddha"" seems to draw people in, but not all of the songs are meditative."
1,Buddha-Lounge,As bland as white bread. It is a misrepresentation to link this series of 3 CDs in any way to the Buddha Bar CDs or the chillout music category in general. It could play in the background without anyone ever raising their head or moving their body. If your thing is New Age music this might be for you. Everyone else is forewarned.
5,The Buddha-Lounge is the Place to Be !,"This is one of the most groovin' world beat lounge CD's I've ever laid my ears on. Each track is perfectly situated into the overall mix of these 13 tracks from a variety of hot new European artists including Roedelius, Alquima, Marcator, Peter Merenger and others as well as the best new tracks from top selling Sequoia artists including David & Steve Gordon, Gary Stadler with amazing new celtic singing sensation Stephannie and a hot new track from Zingaia. The overall effect of this dancable world-beat title absolutley is hypnotic. It's great to slip on the headphones and drift into it or as ambient for your next smart-drink cocktail party. Each track expertly blends a spiritual vibe with techo world-beat grooves to produce a consciousness exhalting and joyful musical celebration. The Buddha-Lounge really is the place to be !"
1,Total waste of money!,"It is way too hard to get this stuff off after use! If you happen to touch anything but your body, it is on there for good. The bottle itself develops a super greasy feel immediately after the first use. Go with the ID Glide water based lube instead. Millennium costs twice as much, is a total mess, and doesn't feel nearly as good. My GF hates this stuff too so it was a total loss!"
3,NEVER REC.,I Just never got the stuff. I had to have a refund done. I could not believe it took so long.
2,It gets sticky!,Title says it all. It gets sticky fast. I would recommend Wet Platinum over this product.
4,Slippery not sticky,"This lube is very slippery which is awesome in most cases, however it does make it a little unweildy at times. Just a wash with soap water cleans it right up.Also, this lube is better than others because it's not sticky. When it dries up it just goes away. I actually heard that some people use it as a moisturizer because it helps to trap water in your skin."
4,Good stuff,"I will admit, this is my first time using lube. It was good though, and not too greasy or oily. Don't know if there is a taste or not, but no smell. Good value, I would buy again, but still up for trying other stuff maybe."
5,Never Sticky,"I know this is an odd item to leave a review with but I have to say how much ID has created a product that rocks! A little goes a long way. No more 'sticky stuff' I even use to on my legs after shaving, it leaves them silky smooth. I'm sure I'll find other uses for it.Tracy"
5,RQM-Paul Strange,"I have read this book as a physics undergraduate and also since I started my Ph.D. in theoretical physics, and I have found it, unlike other text books, very well written and extremely helpful. It is highly recommendable for undergraduates and the maths is very easy to follow for any science undergraduate or graduate. It is definitely one of the best relativistic quantume mechanics books available."
2,Limited Support,"Its does what it says.. But if you want to use it with MCE, sagetv or Mythtv its not user friendly.It was a waste of money for me.I recently purchased HDhomerun (dual tuner) by Silicondust and love it.I can record my local QAM channels using Sagetv.Also, they support Mythtv."
1,Don't Believe Everything you Read,"I read all these great reviews and bought the absurd thing.Whenever I record, the result has a flickering line at the top that is so irritating, I can't watch.Technical support says it will always be there.This thing is worthless junk. The other reviewers must just use it to watch TV. Recording is a hopeless joke. Sure, use WinDVD Creator to record. Oh, wait WinDVD only records analog, so you can forget digital.I've have returned this ""product"" for a refund."
4,"not great, not bad",A Kiss fan will like most of the album. I find that Peter's ballad that is to try copy 'Beth'tried too hard and over did it. I do find myself skipping around between 4-5 of the better songs on the album.I would say that it is worth buying.
4,The Cd is not typical of KISS,"Hello,KISS's Physco Circus is not like the KISS I have been waiting for ,for many years it is still one of the better albums I have listened to this year and is much better than carnival of souls if you are a KISS fan I highly recomaned this one four you to buy"
4,It was worth the wait.,"This is dinosaur rock at its best! I've been waiting years for the original four members to come to their senses and give the fans what we've been begging for. And they've delivered in Spades (a wink to Ace). From the title track to the closing strains of JOURNEY OF 1,000 YEARS it's Classis KISS with a slightly updated feel. Songs like WE ARE ONE contain an overdue nod of the head to us fans who have kept them in champagne all these years. While songs like WITHIN (which sounds like it was probably intended for use on CARNIVAL OF SOULS) offer us a harder edged more modern sound that is offset by the pure 70's guitar pyrotechnics of Ace Frehley on INTO THE VOID. This album also marks the re-emergence of Gene Simmons as a major songwriting force in the band. The last few years his contributions have been minimal and half hearted, but no more. Gene really shines in the Circus. There's something to love in this collection for KISS fans of every KISS era."
4,a great comeback effort-KISS rocks the world!,"this was worth the wait. KISS is back and kicking a**again. its not as good as some of their 70's stuff, but whatis. they've been there and back, and will be staying longer, i hope. you have to admire these guys, they still kick a**!!! more, please!!"
4,"This cd is different than the other Kiss cd's, but it's good","This cd is somewhat different than the other Kiss cd's of the past, but it's still a good cd. I think that it's great how a heavy metal band like Kiss made such a comeback. Journey of 1,000 Years, Psycho Circus, Within, and We Are One are the best songs. This cd, 4 stars."
5,the best lp yet,"seen them in Detriot on new years eve nite ,and let me tell u want a show the best i have seen yet. the lp is allrigt i like some songs better than others .whats next only time well tell .rock on kiss"
4,KLASSIK KISS is back!!!,"For those of you old enough to remember when Kiss lost Peter and Ace in the Eighties, and missed them for the rest of the decade, this gives a glance at what could have been. This album could have sold mega-copies in '82. I like it an I hope it does well now. The enhanced CD thing is a great gimmick. The screen saver is nothing special, BUT Kiss has also launched its own internet provider and members page. This is such a cool info and marketing tool. Buy the CD and join the Kiss Army Online for the upcoming tour. See ya at KISSONLINE.net"
5,KISS ROX AGAIN,YOU WANTED THE BEST......... YOU GOT THE BEST...........Is a statement that has been following the band for several years and this album is no different.It flat out rocks.Welcome to the Psyco Circus and enjoy!!!!!!!!!
2,Reunion album?,"This is supposed to be the big reunion album right? Well, you will be interested to know that Ace Frehley said that he only played on half the album and Peter, like on DYNASTY, only played drums on one song, ""Into the void"". ""We are one"" is a good song but most of the album is very cheesy and lacking in the originality and raw sound of 1970s KISS. It's obvious that they arent together on this record, it doesent sound anything like the old KISS. Don't get me wrong KISS is one of a kind but even they admitted it's over musically. Stick to the 1970s recordings. Anything from KISS(1974) to DYNASTY(1979). PSYCHO CIRCUS is not essential nor is it a fair introduction to this phenomenal group."
5,A Great Album,"This is my first Kiss CD and I simply love it. The album boasts great rock & roll songs and it is excellent for those who appreciate good ole rock music. There are also some slow rock songs. Great for those with occasional romantic moodswings. All in all, this is one ROCKING album!"
1,"Without their Kabuki face makeup, Kiss would be nowhere.","Kiss is a lame band with their image only covering for their many songs with inane lyrics with their makeup and concerts. They could'nt write a song if their lives depended on it. If you want metal, buy a Metallica CD. If you want moronic disgiuses and Cd titles like ""Psycho-Circus"" buy KISS.By the way, only the dumbest band in the world would try to get cash by getting Tood MacFarlane to create a series of comic books and action figures!"
2,I WAS MISLEAD,"I was mislead when I bought this item, and I want to clarify for anyone else who might be wondering: THIS IS NOT ""PYSCHO CIRCUS"". I thought when I ordered it that it was some kind of ""deluxe"" or ""master"" edition fo the album...it isn't. It has four tracks, ""Pyscho Circus"" (Edit and LP), ""Raise Your Glasses"", and ""I Was Made For Lovin' You"".I know the price should've given that away, but at the time of purchase, I was finding 79-cent comic books, so I just figured I got lucky."
1,Waste of money,"There's nothing worse than a bunch or overweight middle aged men trying to go back to their party days. This is pure trash, if you want KISS, go to LICK IT UP. Their BEST CD ever. This is forgettable music."
3,Original Lineup Returns,"This 1998 offering by KISS sees the four original members reunite for an album the first time since 1979 with Dyanasty. Key tracks are: Psycho Circus, I Pledge Allegience to the State of Rock n' Roll, and Into the Void. It compares poorly to their 70s output and the album as a whole sounds flat and uninspired. I Finally Found My Way is a decent ballad. Still, worth getting for KISS enthusiasts that can deliver something to its fans. It's all hype."
3,It's Just Not The Same Without The Original Chemistry,"I bought this album becoming hopeful that i would hear an ALL ORIGINAL KISS album (like Rock and Roll Over), and as it turns out the original members played on only 3 tracks. The remaining tracks are quite good, but lack the ""swagger"" and ""charisma"" of Ace and Peter's contributions. For that, it becomes just another KISS record to me. I suppose that's what makes Alive! such a great recording.This most especially holds true for Peter Criss. Anyone who has doubts to the man's capability and timing should listen to Into The Void, or 100,000 years on ALIVE! That is (for me) one the the first (and best) heavy metal drum solos of all time.Believe it (3)!"
5,Great Melodic Rock Album,This is a great melodic rock album that doesn't fall short of my expectations. A great listen that will keep you moving.
3,A solid album,"Kiss' Psycho Circus--their eighteenth studio album--was released in 1998. Ten tracks are contained. The material is in a straight-ahead hard rock musical direction. Overall, I find the songwriting to be satisfying, the musicianship to be tight, and the sound quality to be crisp. My favorite songs are ""Psycho Circus,"" ""Within,"" and ""Into the Void."" The hard-driving ""Psycho Circus"" displays propulsive vocals from Paul Stanley. ""Within"" is a tough-sounding, interesting tune with versatile, industrious vocals from Gene Simmons and appealing guitar work--especially the aggressive central guitar riff. ""Into the Void"" is a vigorous one that sports cool, ambitious vocals from Ace Frehley and nice rhythm guitar playing. An example of another cut that I like is the energy-filled ""You Wanted the Best""--lead vocals are split between Stanley, Simmons, Frehley, and Peter Criss. The CD foldout includes the song lyrics. The disc is just over 44 minutes. Psycho Circus is a recommendable piece of work."
2,Kiss - 'Psycho Circus' (Mercury) 2 1/2 stars,"Review no. 266. Knew I still had my copy of this Kiss CD, simply had to take a few minutes to dig it up. I've heard from some of the biggest Kiss fans that I know comment that 'Psycho Circus' is even worse than 'Unmasked' - now that's saying something. I, for one didn't feel this disc was THAT dreadful nor was it good either - it's so-so. Tunes I thought sort of stood out were ""I Pledge Allegiance To The State Of Rock & Roll"", ""Into The Void"", the Top 40-ish ""We Are One"", maybe ""Dreamin'"" and ""Journey Of 1,000 Years"". Their follow-up 'Sonic Boom' is much better."
1,Uhh... No.,"The first three songs are okay, but after that this thing is totally down the drain. Believe me, I LOVE kiss, but the whole record is like ""LOOKING BACK ON DAYS OF GLORY"". Examples : Looking Back it feels all right, Let's make up or break up. I recommend KISS (1974) thru CREATURES OF THE NIGHT (1982). Psycho Circus, I Pledge Allegiance, and Within are OKAY but the rest stink. It's hard to believe that that the same people who made this made LOVE GUN, CREATURES OF THE NIGHT, and ROCK N ROLL OVER."
2,Kiss; Stick to concerts!!!,"If Kiss originally sounded like this they would never have become famous! I love Kiss's concerts, but their name recognition will make this album sell, not the quality. Within is the only song that stuck in my mind after listening to the album at least 10 times. I have all of the other Paul, Peter, Gene, & Ace albums and 12th row tickets to the Cleveland show. I hope they stick to playing the seventies stuff! I traded this album in at the record exchange and used the money to buy the new Metallica(Garage Inc). I advise you do the same!"
2,WOW,If everyone actually listens to the words in all the songs they will see that each has a special meaning that deals with real life. Not exactly like the KISS of 20 years ago but things do change. Cd song quality is excellent. Thumbs up guys!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,Dishonest,"Frehley and Criss don't play on the record, for the most part, so it's a dishonest effort, and deceitful since no credits were given to the musicians who actually played drums and lead guitar.Why Kiss did this is beyond me.The songs aren't that good either. The production is too slick, and absent the chopsticks quality that Ace and Peter gave Kiss during the classic years, it's sterile."
2,SOFT AND PREDICTABLE,"The attempt to make another Destroyer fell very short. The title track is easily the best song on this album. It was obvious right away that Peter Criss wasn't playing on it....he does't have that kind of talent so why go in and make this album at all? Before it even came out you knew that Peter would be singing a ballad. ""I Finally Found My Way"" is no ""Beth"" or ""Hard Luck Woman."" The rest of it is just too soft. There is no heavy drum sound. It almost like a weak Lick It Up minus the better songs. Get back with Eric and Bruce! Don't worry about makinganother Destroyer. I'll be satisfied with another Revenge."
5,A joyful time,"This CD was a joyful time for me, since it was Kiss's first all-new recording since their reunion. It contains some very good material that I knew Kiss could play. It's in between my other two favorite Kiss albums (Love Gun and Creatures Of The Night) in its intensity. I do highly recommend it."
5,Best Kiss has done since the early 80's,The original Kiss is by far the best Kiss. The classic Kiss style with modern cuts. This release brings out the best of what Kiss used to do in the 70's.
2,Not the band they used to be...,"Kiss has had a lot of hit and miss efforts...you'd think that after all this time apart they'd have more to deliver. Stick to the stuff that made this band famous, 'cause Psycho Circus is drivel. And any of the other ""reviewers"" who might disagree, let's be honest: if this was the level of stuff they put out in the 70's, the band would long since be a memory. Don't waste your money on this re-tread."
5,"Excellent KISS, but Some Inconsistency","I Really did enjoy this album. The Best track hands down is Ace's ""into the void"". The rest have varying degrees of KISS-ability. By no stretch is it a good KISS album; more than likely only the fans will REALLY like this album. Which is unfortunate.If you are able to get the release with a CD, a 3D video, and the 3D glasses, I think thats the best experience of this album. Its a big pity that a full set of Videos for the album were not done. They could have done a great Multimedia event, since KISS is basically a product of their shows, so the music is the soundtrack to the theatre.It is a Nice collectors CD if you enjoyed the band from the early days, but outside of that, if you are not a fan, its probably ( as much as I hate to say this) an item to avoid.My 5 stars are because it works great in bringing back some good memories."
3,I expected better,"When kiss decided to reunite i was ecstatic! But, this release was lackluster. In fact i would recommend it to any kiss fan. It has a few good songs on it. I think it was one of Kiss's worst efforts along with Crazy nights, Hot in the shade and Carnival of souls. Both Criss and Frehley have left the band at different times since they reunited. This leads me to believe Simmons and Stanley are not giving them there fair share."
3,Could have been better,"I think that Psyco Circus is an alight albam...At least it's better then Destoryer...I think the songs like Psyco Circus, Into the Void are one of the best Kiss songs of all time...I think they sould have not put so much Simmions and Stanley songs...I think they souldv'e let Ace and Peter at least put more then one or two songs...They souldv'e been in the albam more. Well I hope the next Kiss albam isn't like this, I want to hear styles like from Kiss, Hotter than Hell, Rock n' Roll Over, Love Gun, and Unmasked...They also sould play more songs from these albams in concert more instead of King of the Night Time World and 100,000 Years which are boreing songs. All in all Psyco Circus is Average at best"
1,Classic Kiss? Nope!,"Disappointing. I haven't listened to this album since I bought it. Yes, I like Kiss, But this album just doesn't do anything for me. They should have recorded another ""Destroyer"", ""Rock And Roll Over"", etc, But this is not the case here. Save your money."
3,Just another Kiss record,"Kiss has everything a band can ask for. Loyal fans, great producers to work with, outstanding stage presence and an over the top show that is second to none. They lack the ablity to write great songs or play with any musical talent... this record is no different. This was the last studio record from Kiss, although they have been touring for the last 7 years since its release.As for this cd, it has its moments. The title track might be one of the best Kiss songs to date. Within', and We Are One are also great tracks. Dreamin' is a complete rip off of Alice Coopers ""I'm 18"" Into the Void, I Pledge Allegiance to the State of Rock and Roll and I Finally Found My Way are just plain bad. Skip those tracks at all cost. If you can get this cd cheap, go for it. If your a Kiss nut, I'm sure you have it already."
3,"Say what you want, but...","Say what you want about this CD, but the song ""Psycho Circus"" is pure KISS rock'n'roll of the old times. The rest is really cheesy, not very inspired, but is not so bad as some fans try to say. In general, is an authentic recording (even taking account of Gene Simmons's known interest in making huge profits. ""Into the Void"", by Ace Frehley, shows that this guy is a real musician."
2,could be better,"being a kiss fan for many years now (i'm 37) I listened very carefully to pshyco circus and hear destroyer all over again. Full of themselves. Stardom going to there heads. Don't take me the wrong way but, I think KISS could do better. best tracks in my opinion are Psycho Circus , We are One , Raise Your Glasses , I Finally Found My Way , and Journey Of 1,000 years. To finalize , Psycho Circus is the best cut out of the whole cd. With all the experiences these guys have they could do better. Looking forward to the next cd...... Drheid"
3,"Psycho Circus...We wanted the best, but fell a bit short.","Psycho Circus was certainly not the best that Kiss has to offer, but it certainly is not the worst by any means. The ""circus music"" intro is cool and leads well into the best song (The title track). Other songs which are worth noting are Raise Your Glasses, Journey of 1,000 Years, We Are One, and Dreamin. Their upcoming tour should be a spectacle to see with the proper mix of songs. Kiss is still the best Live band to date! The album is worth buying even if half the songs will by bypassed by the CD button."
4,Welcome to the show...,"The reviews are all over the map on this one-so here's the deal.A typical Kiss record has about 5 very strong songs, the remainder is medoicre material. Psycho Circus falls right intoline. (Destroyer is an exception-A KISS masterpiece) The record starts strong with Psycho Circus, a cool rocker from Paul. Gene comes thru with three moody mid-tempo pieces that work really well-Within, We are One and Journey of 1000 years. Ace jams on Into the Void. Those are the 5 strong tracks, the other tunes are mediocre. A few more rockers from Paul which are decent and a ballad from Peter, which is pleasant, but not memorable.Many of the songs are celebrating their survival and triumph in the world of rock and roll. They were in the midst of a celebratory tour, so it rubbed off on the lyrics. They have every right to take this victory lap. Brilliant CD packaging with holographic image. Well worth the price of admission!"
2,psycho circus,"this album is forced....very forced. kiss knew they had to come up with something fast. there was zero effort put into this album...the gayest song ever written is ""you wanted the best you got the best"" are they kidding? i am a long time kiss fan for 21 years and i dont believe they put this out. a song about putting the makeup back on??? what??? remember ""hotter than hell"" and ""creatures of the night""? psycho circus is such a novelty album...its not even a group effort...ace has one track and peter didnt even play drums on the album. money money money. i love kiss, but nowadays gene and paul want the money. they're old. ace has started drinking and doing drugs again...he cant even stand up straight or talk. hes barely coherent. gene and paul just want him to make it through the next tour. im over it. ive lost interest...kiss...you're too old...end the farewell tour now."
4,kiss,i really like it and its all the original members ive had psycho circus since it came out i bought this thinking it had the bonous live disc but to my disapointment it didnt but i got it elsewhere later but its KISS so i love it
3,Wildly Uneven,"This CD has some of thier best songs on it and some of the worst songs. For the most part this is a worthy effort but songs like ""Raise your Glasses"", ""I Finally Found My Way To You"" & ""You Wanted The Best"" just sound too hokey and calculated. Think about it: a Beth II with Peter singing and a song about being back together for the reunion tour. It's interesting to know that ""You Wanted The Best"" is the first studio song to have all four members singing(3 of the 4 sang on ""Kissin' Time"" from their first album). Another problem with the CD is that it only has 10 songs. I've seen Gene being quoted in magazines saying ""Less is more"" um... no, not really Gene. I'm guessing that they couldn't come up with any more worthy material. This is a good CD, just not a GREAT CD... we waited 19 years for this..????"
3,Psycho Circus just so-so,"I don't know what else I was expecting, but I guess I'm not surprised. It's just the Gene and Paul show with 1 track from Ace and Peter just to prove to everyone that they showed up. Don't get me wrong, some of the songs are excellent. Songs like ""Within"", ""Journey of 1000 years"", and the title track are all stellar. The rest just show everyone how conceited Kiss are. And to top it all off, I've had to program out ""I've Finally Found My Way"", absolutely the worst ballad Kiss has ever recorded. Kiss should've stuck with Bruce and Eric and recorded a heavy record like ""Revenge"" and ""Carnival Of Souls"". They may not have sol as many concert tickets, but they would have recorded one hell of a better album. At the very least, Gene's songs should have been a bit darker to match his demon persona. And ten tracks clocking in at under 45 minutes - shame on you. That may have been good enough for 1978, but not 1998."
3,"not great, but a start","The way I see it, after 18 years apart, this cd was about what I expected. Not great, but a start.The shining moments for me include, ""Psycho Circus"", ""Into The Void"" and ""Raise Your Glasses"".Kiss has never had an all the way thru great studio album, and they still do not.You know what though, so what?!They still are the greatest live band in the world. All these young punks out there today should take notes,Kiss is what rock and roll(over)is suppost to be about. No whiners allowed,long live the best, KISS!"
4,This album is the ultimate KISS melting pot!!!!!!,"Although ""Psycho Circus"" contains a number of worthy KISS-like songs, it is by no means a ""Love Gun"" or a ""Creatures of the Night"". It sounds like a ""Best of the Solo albums II"". The original members have tried to capture some of their more memorable moments of the '70's. I thank God that they're back, but I feel that they could have spent a lot more of their time writing and recording the songs that appear on the CD. I also think that both Ace and Peter should have been given a stronger participation in terms of contributing more musical compositions. Overall, "" Psycho Circus"" is a very good album from a band that is on its way to recovering its musical identity. I wish that the original line-up continue to write and perform new songs to show everyone that they are here to stay!!!!!!!!! Most of all, I HOPE THAT KISS FINALLY COME TO COLOMBIA!!!!!!!!! Hey guys, Latin America isn't only Brazil, Chile and Argentina, it's COLOMBIA AS WELL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,KISS rocks and roll..they are still best band!!!,"my name is Steven.i'm from New York City. My two words for this ""KISS are GREAT""..after 25 years..of ROCKING..man..People are whining KISS are old..HEll NO!! they are rock all those so called heavy bands. i've been Kiss fan since i was 16..years."
4,Great to hear the real KISS again!!,"This album totally kicks, man!! I really like ""Into The Void"", ""Raise Your Glasses"", and ""I Pledge Allegiance""---my only complaint is that the album just isn't long enough; more contributions from Ace & Peter would've solved that problem for me, but I guess that's up to the producer...but as I said, it's the real KISS and it's great!! :)"
2,Total Waste,"I think i listened to this 2 times since it came out. Its just kiss trying to make an overblown commercial album with the same producer from Destroyer but sorry folks it doesnt work at all. This is not where kiss was headed at the time. If you listen to Carnival of Souls which was recorded right before this with Kulick and Singer youll hear the direction that Kiss was going. This was basically made for the money because the fact that it was a reunion record made everyone buy it. Too bad its one of the most unmemorable Kiss albums ever. The best song recorded for this isnt even on the cd. Its called ""its my Life"" and its on the boxed set. Lord knows why this song was left off here. Its better than the every song here combined. Anyway dont buy this, buy CARNIVAL OF SOULS if you want to hear some music with some depth and not just throwaway junk."
2,Hired Guns....,"This is not a ""Kiss"" album. This is an album where Gene & Paul hired Ace to play and paid Peter to sing...Criss does not play drums on this album. What you get here is nowhere even close to a group effort. Just an effort to $$$ in on the subsequent reunion tour. It is impossible for me to rate this higher considering it's a Kiss infomercial in the form of a cd. Notice how many used product there is for sale? How about the going price for a used ""Psycho Circus""? ..."
4,i give it a solid 4 stars,I think this is a solid kiss album.about 4 of the songs stand out as some of my favorites.i just listened to it after about 4 years the only thing i hate is the sound quality.the highs are tinny and the bass is so flat.but i guess thats cds for ya!i wish this came out on vinyl!
4,pebonr surprised me on this,"Yes, Pebonr told me to listen to this one. I had long given up on these egotistical porn rockers. It was a surprise. They captured some of that great Kiss magic on this cd and I'm sure it was because Ace and Peter were back. Great songs include the title track, Into the Void, We are one, Within, and the wonderful Journey of 1000 yrs. Great to see that Simmons concentrated on the music here instead of the bulge. He sounds inspired- haven't really heard that since Creatures. The sound and atmosphere are back in this cd."
2,"Pandering to ""new"" fans.","I made the mistake of buying this album having not heard any of the songs, and only being a faithful fan of Kiss. Yeah I think that new fans (people that started to listen to Kiss after the reunion) might enjoy this. It has all of the elements of classic Kiss, but it's missing something.Do I think that the prime motivation for this was the money?Yes. Purely for cash. It's nice that the fans had something to go with the tour that was happening at the time, but this album doesn't age very well, mainly because this album wasn't very good in it's conception, and was executed poorly.In retrospect, Kiss has made worse albums. ""Unmasked"" comes to mind. Peter Criss' solo album was weak, but at least an effort was made. ""Animalize"" was poor, but Kiss was playing catch-up, and was breaking in a new guitarist too.Some of the tunes are catchy enough, but that wears off quickly. Based on the merit of the somewhat catchy songs, I rated this 2 stars. Other than that, not much here."
2,A disappointing reunion album...,"Because of the fanatical loyalty of their fans, KISS has magaged to remian popular all these years despite their devolving musicianship. I used to be one of their greatest fans, but ""Psycho Circus"" is nothing compared their earlier work. I believe this album is nothing more than a huge cash cow. KISS was an inspiration for an entire generation of great rock bands, but those days are gone, and ""Psycho Circus"" proves it. Ace and his old band is the only hope KISS fans have. I hope he gets back with them soon..."
2,Disapointing Swan Song,"A rather uneven CD, with only a few good songs such as ""Psycho Circus"", ""Within"", and ""Dreamin'"". If you're a true-blue KISS fan, then buy it. If you're not, save your hard-earned money."
3,Kiss returns with a raucous vengeance,"Kiss returns to the heavy metal world with a new and raucous album. Psycho Circus's cool album cover and concept gives fans a refreshing and introspective look into the band's triumphant return. The songs sound different from the seventies albums and yet still retain a good rock and roll sensibility.I listened to this album over fifty times and like some of the songs, including ""Psycho Circus,"" ""Into The Void,"" ""Raise Your Glasses,"" and ""I Pledge Allegiance To The State Of Rock And Roll."" Still, the album might have a better effect when integrated with the band's live show. Nevertheless, ""Journey Of A Thousand Years"" symbolizes the band's resiliency and longevity."
3,"Definetly, true KISS, merchandise included!","I wasn't sure if I should buy the CD or not. I grew up with the band, and I liked the way the have been moving forward these years. And suddenly, they want to take us back to 1978! We've been there already! The good news is that, when they stop bragging about how good they are (I pledge..., You wanted the best, Raise your glases), they DO have damn good songs! If you really want the best, remove the songs I mentioned before and add the first half of ""Carnival of Souls"" up to Jungle. That would've been a great disc! Also, don't sell merchandise to us on the disc! They have been doing this since ""Alive III"". Enough, OK? And still, I don't know why, but I will be there on the tour!"
5,Get Ready To Rock!,"This is THE album. If you've been waiting for a rock album that really ROCKS, then this is your album! Kiss has really made it worth the wait with this album. The first track on the album grabs you by the throat, and the last track leaves you feeling satisfied. Paul, Gene, Ace, and Peter are in rare form. Get your make-up, platform shoes, and get ready to ROCK!"
2,TWO STARS FOR THE ONLY TWO GOOD SONGS ON IT !,"The great songs are: ""RAISE YOUR GLASSES"" and ""PSYCHO CIRCUS"". The rest is below Kiss' standards. We'll always keep wondering if this band love its fans or just want their money."
1,not satisfied!,"i was listening to this and i noticed that this is a rip from a whole bunch od Insane Clown Posse cds, if u truly listen to ICP na dhtne listen to this cd you will notice that they are very similar and unfortunately for KISS, the songs that they related theirs to were out before this cd came out. I was not satisfied when i heard this cd!Juggalos stand tall!"
3,"Not ""Revenge"" but most certainly PURE KISS!","Although, ""Revenge"" was probably the best album to date, ""Psycho Circus"" is most definitely KISS. The music on this CD reminds me of the early years, rough & loose, but still something you can rock out to. I highly recommend it to any KISS fan!"
2,Augghhhh!!!!,"Why are so many people rating this album 4-5 stars...I have been a die hard KISS fan since 1975. The various breakups broke my heart. I was so excited for this disk to come out. I like what Ace has done on his own and thought that the original 4 could recapture the magic of the 70's. I guess it wasn't meant to happen. What is with all of these 4 and 5 star reviews. This disk is no better than Animalize or Asylum. These disks were good in the mid 80's but I wanted the best but I got the 80's instead. They still rule in my heart, but theyt need to come up with something that isn't simply done for the money as this seems to be.Bluestar"
3,What did you expect? It's a KISS album!,"Bruce Fairbairn did a good job of production on this uneven effort, getting a great sound out of the fab 4. Unfortunately, not all of the material was worth the effort. This is not to say that I didn't enjoy the album. Cuts like ""Psycho Circus,"" ""Within"" and ""Into the Void"" really kick. There are some other good moments as well. It's similar to many other KISS albums where it seems that the boys figured that once they had 5 or 6 good songs, the rest didn't matter as much. All in all, I'm glad I bought it. It's a kick for a long time fan to have something new from the original version of the group."
1,Not very Good,"I am very surprised to see so many good reviews of this CD. I work in a used CD store and we can't give this CD away. Every time I personally try to return it, we already have too many in stock to take it. I love Kiss but this Cd just doesn't have anything to it. There's no excitement. Most bands fizzle out after there prime time but Kiss was awesome in both the seventies and eighties and this Cd doesn't hold a candle to anything they have done in the past, with or without Ace and Peter. Listen to Amazon's previews for yourself, the lyrics are boring and so is the music."
4,Brings back memories,II used to read this to my son when he was little. He lived it and we decided to get matching tattoos of the Hungry Thing and Small Hungry Thing.
4,A compendiuom of 7 books/stories,This book was published in 1998 by Carol & Graf Publishers who are I might say the heroes of aficionados of Erotic LiteratureAlthough the book cover says that it contains three rare works it is made up of at least 9 short stories and books .. 616 pagesThe main book 'Sweet Tales' deal with a nunnery in Italy and how their time is passed between prayers. Nicely written and definitely erotic ...I will not review the whole book since it's out of print BUT the BEST part of the book is what they call part 2 and deals with Frank returning to Victorian England from Germany where he learned and practices hypnotism..... And does that ever get him into nice and neat places ....The story is STUPENDOUS and this book would have rated five start if bout one quarter of it weren't crap ......
2,Where is the feeling?,"I am a follower of Gloria's music, but not of her voice. Alma Caribena has great music and production, but it lacks of sentiment and feeling from her part. Maybe she should think about her vocal performance a little more. Nice songs though."
2,Its time to retire,"While I tremendously enjoyed the musical stylings presented on this CD, I would have enjoyed them even more if Gloria's vocals were not so completely annoying. In the hands of a more competent singer, this CD would be perfect. My advice is, if you are trying to exterminate the roaches in your house, then this is a good bet. Otherwise, save your money."
4,Looking inwards,The word soul can mean what's inside; a feeling. Alma Caribena is truely a look into the heart on the latin culture and Gloria's life. Every song is full of the feeling of being in love in the Caribbean. Soft gentle music that puts you in the mood...
4,¡Tengo un alma caribeña!,"Even if you've never been to Caribbean, Gloria takes you there with this CD. Perhaps the majority of the songs are on the slower side, but she is ""soulful"" and it shows. My friend bought this CD, and I borrowed it so much that I got it for myself. The ""No me dejes"" remix will get you dancing. ""Tres Gotas de Agua Bendita"" is really fun and lively (with Celia Cruz), while ""Por un Beso"" is a heartbreaker. Yet even in the slower songs, the background music stays true to the Caribbean, which I appreciated. ¡Dale! You won't regret the purchase."
2,non-plused,"Let me start with saying that I am not a Gloria Estefan fan. I don't know much about her, but I like music from Latin America. I must say I find her delivery mannered and very insincere. Her attempt at emotion is very cold. It's as if she has studied Marc Anthony and Celia Cruz a little to hard. She can't swing or sway if her life depended on it. Se me hizo muy aburrido la musica de esta Gloria."
2,Somewhat Misleading Title,"Being a rabid Gloria's fan from the mid 80's on, I rushed to purchase this album. To my surprise I found myself hitting the next track button more often than not.'Por Un Beso', 'Punto De Referencia', 'Dame Otra Oportunidad' are songs best suited for somebody else. At times it appears that Gloria is struggling to make the notes.When I read 'Alma Caribeña' in a title I espect songs like 'No Me Dejes De Querer' or 'Tres Gotas De Agua Bendita' when I want to hear some salsa rythms or 'Como Me Duele Perderte' and 'No Me Dejes De Querer' if I want just to chill and enjoy Gloria's rich and beautiful voice.I'm still a fan of Estefan's music but this 'Alma Caribeña' sadly isn't my favorite."
3,Not as good as Abriendo Puertas,This album provides music that would be great for background listening. There's nothing on it that you want to turn up too loud; just nice passive tunes. The cover graphics are better than average.
3,I was expecting more out of this,"I was expecting more out of this CD. It was good...but, unlike previous Gloria Estefan works this one was formulaic..."
1,Gloria... que pasa?,"I don't know what Gloria was thinking when she made this CD... but don't expect a ""Mi Tierra"" part 2! This CD lacks all the great salsa rhythm Gloria provided with both Mi Tierra and Abriendo Puertas. In fact, you get so sick of hearing all the ballads on this CD, that you want to return it the very next day! Dont get me wrong... i love Gloria, but Alma Caribena is terrible."
3,"Not as good as ""Mi tierra""","I was anxious awaiting Glorias new release and bought it last week even before the official releasedate, May 23rd. Upon listening to it for the first time I was kind of disappointed in one way. The cuban/caribean sound is there but I miss the uptempo rhythm which was present in her previous latindisc ""Mi Tierra"". Far the best song of ""Alma Caribeña"" is ""No me dejes de querer"" with an extra great remix by Pablo Flores. I'm looking forward to new remixes that will surely pop up in the near future. Nevertheless, Gloria keeps me amazing with her bright voice and her good music that can't stop you from dancing."
1,disappointing,"for a true latin music lover, a waste to have bought it, although I am a fan of Gloria Estefan. Simple arrangements, unimaginative lyrics, no ""sabor"". I will greet any future disc of hers with scepticism."
2,Hummm... Not too much,"I found this album a little dissapointing. And the sensation increase in comparation with ""mi tierra"". The main thing on this is the track selection, wich makes the whole a very downtempo album. Althought there's a couple of up & high beat pieces, the sensation I percive it's like if there were a down for gloria and she wanted to put it in the album. That's no bad. The bad thing comes up when I heard it and I can't get down, Just a little bored. There's no feeling, no emotion, no heart, no music. If you are planning to buy a gloria's CD, don't get this one. Mi tierra would do it best."
5,Great resource,"This was a required book for my study abroad which I took in Italy. This was a great book, although it is quite extensive, so with that it might be better used for a more in depth study then a simple read.The book provided a great resource for papers (yes plural) on many aspects of Florence and it really does make a great portrait of Florence. It's a great city and a great book!"
2,To Be Avoided,"As opposed to the general consensus of the other reviews on this book, I found Levey's Florence to be SUB-PAR compared to other works on the same topic. His understanding of Florentine history is poor and often down right insulting (his remarks that the vibrant political life in the early communal period was like the ""mafia"" is a fine example). His insistence on the greatness of Sienese art and on Northern Renaissance Art are wholly inappropriate in a book on Florence. It would be like writing a book on the history of the British Empire and constantly making a point to discuss imperial Russia or Rome. Let's focus on the topic at hand and save the other comments for other books. Mr Levey announces his lack of ability as a historian at the beginning of the work and he is certainly accurate. A much better read is Florence by Gene Adam Brucker."
3,Not incredible,"Ever buy a CD just cuz you like one song? I did, when I bought this one. ""where the party at"" w/ Nelly is awesome. But after that, it dosen't get much better. Best songs ""Where the party at"" w/ Nelly, ""cut somethin'"" w/ Ludacris, ""this goes out"" w/ Big Duke and Joe Blak. Notice anything? All the good songs are with feature artists."
2,more like.... Ragged Little Thrill,"im guilty. i am one of the many rap fans who rushed out to buy this cd after hearing nelly's ""where the party at"". after listening through the cd twice i have heard more than enough. aside from nelly's track #2, i found very little rap. in fact, the only decent rapping comes from ludacris(#4- cut something). i found the cd so slow and smooth and boring, that it made ""where the party at"" as out of place as a fat kid in dodgeball."
3,trhill is gone,"good cd if you like love songs jagged edge has the wrong name, only thing hardcore is their gear. unfortunately hardcore r&b died in 1979."
2,Greatly Disappointing,"I'm shocked at how badly this album actually turned out. Perhaps it was too big of a rush job but the lyrics and production on this album do not compare to the JE Heartbreak album. Most of the songs are weak and nothing really sticks out and grabs you the way many of the great tracks from JE Heratbreak did. When you're best track features Nelly, you know you are probably in trouble. I'm as big a fan as any but i can't sing their praises this time. Clearly Jagged Edge is clearly lacking the hunger from their last album."
4,good follow up,good album boys..... not better than the last but this is a good follow up..... the slow songs are great... same formula as the last nuthing new here.... The song that will take the album over the top will be the ballad NO RESPECT the song is off the hook. The album will grow on you... a must have.....
3,It was okay,"I purchased Jagged Edge's second album, ""J.E. Heartbreak"", and I liked it a lot except that it seemed too short for me. Their third album, Jagged Little Thrill, is longer, which is a plus, but it seems that they are trying to be hard. Jagged Edge can't be hard core. Don't get me wrong, most of the CD is what we expect from J.E.: love/slow songs. For the most part, their CD is good. U gotta check out Track 4 with Ludacris, Track 6--Can We Be Tight (my favorite song on the album), and Track 13--Head of Household (for all the real fellas out there) All and all, as I said before, this CD is good, and U should go out there and cop it. But for real though, 112 Part III, is way better!!"
2,Always room for improvement,"I bought this album after hearing Where The Party At? I still regret it. The only other song I like is Cut Somethin'. All the other songs sound too much alike and the slow jams are a million miles from being creative. All they sing about is breaks up. Do any of their relationships work??????? Basically, I say this album was a waste of money."
5,The best songs are.....................,"- Where the party at- Goodbye- Cut something- Can we be tight- I got it (remix with Naz it also good)- This goes out- Remedy- Lets get married (#1, #2, #3)"
3,Not What Expected,I bought this cd because i liked where the arty at and i heard ludacris and trina were on it. Their r 2 good songs on this cd and one thas=ts ok. My favorite song is cut something feat. ludacris.of course my seconds fav. is where the party at. the okay song is goodbye. I am rating this cd from a rap point of view.
2,Big disappointment after J.E. Heartbreak,"I could not stop playing J.E. Heartbreak, so when I heard ""Where The Party At"" I just ASSUMED Jagged Little Thrill would be another bomb album. It's not. I only gave it 2 stars because a couple of the songs start to grow on you, like ""Cut Somethin'"" and ""Best Man"". I keep playing it because I paid full price, right, but it wears out quick. Heartbreak can stay in the changer for weeks though and never wears out. There's nothing that stands out on Thrill, it's a collection of mediocre melodies with that 1 hit. Save your money on this one. I think they rushed to put out a new album after Heartbreak. They tried to get innovative with their uptempo songs (all 2 of them) but then fell back on predictable slow jams. At least these brothas can sing."
2,1 small problem,"This is a very good CD. I dont normally listen to R&B, but when I heard Where the Party At I knew I was gonna buy this album. Also the tracks with Trina and Ludacris are tight. The only thing wrong with this CD is the fact that ITS CENSORED! It wouldnt bother me that much when nelly and ludacris are the ones getting it, but when the course of the song is bleeped out it just ticks me off"
4,its a cutzie patutzie cd,ThIs Is A mAd GoOd Cd and u gotsta get it. the HiT SinGle WherE da PaRtY At Is ReElY Good and its on thIS CD. theres other ppl on it like JD and StUff and lissin ta #nuMero# TRES(3) FOR ALL OF U unEspanol ppl so its a good cd so go get it or i'll spank yor monkey
4,it is a jagged little thrill,I think this is a really good album compared to there other two albums i can personally say that I LIKE this one better because they have out done themself with this one.
4,jagged edge is back!,"jasgged edges last cd is one of my favorite cds of all time..great voices, and good beats make them better than any other r&b group..i just went out and got the new cd today, the day it came out, and it is hot! with songs done with ludacris and nelly, its makes the cd great. The only reason i give it 4 instead of 5 stars, is that its not quite as good as the last."
5,Great divot tool,"No complaints here, product was just as advertised. Gave it as a gift and everyone thought it was a neat little gadget. Now if only it were to be used more often...."
4,Great Starting Point,"If you're looking for an introductory disk to Chet Baker, this is probably a good start (as any Verve compilation would be). Some vocal tracks (which are not my favorite, but he has a nice distinctive sound), some up tempo, some ballad. All very nice tracks -- this disk is one I listen to frequently. Baker seems to be one of those who defines ""West Coast Cool"" jazz, and this is nice music for a rainy day. File under ""something I heard in Starbucks""."
2,A bit lacking...,"This CD includes a guided visualization that is, indeed, quite relaxing. Unfortunately, you get only 1 visualization session that lasts 17 minutes. It is a start, but for the same money you can get a different CD that gives you a full hour's worth of visualizations and relaxations. The induction phase that relaxes you goes very quickly, and so does the waking up phase. An icy cold waterfall does absolutely nothing to relax me, so when I ""woke up"" from the visualization I was more annoyed than relaxed. I was fairly disappointed with the quality and depth of the content."
2,Financial planning - by the Number,"My first bit of financial planning advice is to save the money you might spend on this book and invest it. you will immediately be further along.Is this book all bad? No, of course not. I gave it two stars since it does prompt you to consider your non financial goals as a key driver.The author begins by telling us about how poor all of us are about financial planning, then we meet a series of multi-millionaires who keep striving for an ever bigger number. There, you have the synopsis. Save your money and time, if you see this book in a bookstore, open it, read the last couple of pages and you will have most of the sound advice in the book."
1,"""The Number"" is totally useless","This book contains nothing of use, whatsoever; it dances around what you need for your ""Number"", never providing any useful information or any insight. (No wonder the publisher concentrated on pre-publication sales; if I hadn't bought it before I could see it, I could have saved myself some money.) For real information about your Number, read William Bernstein, ""The Four Pillars of Investing"" (McGraw-Hill, 2002)."
2,The Number is Zero,"What a waste of paper and time! There is much talk of how Eisenberg has hit ""the sweet spot"" with this book -- bah! Humbug! Sweet nothings is more like it. Entertainingly and personably written, it's as informative as a Jerry Seinfeld tv skit about finances. Eisenberg writes extremely well, but it's all much ado about nothing. Read the last two short chapters at the bookstore and put the money you save into your 401K."
1,Crap,"I read with interest the reviews that supports this book because of the subtitle ""A Completely Differant Way to Think About the Rest of Your Life."" There was some of that in the book although much of the book was devoted to filler. What needed to be said could have easily have been stated in 100 pages or less. I found myself skimming his ""journeys"" in corporate board rooms and his endless discriptions of everyone he met. Who cares?! Generally life is about the journey but in this case the journey was monotonous and never was a destination found that was of any value. The author's apperent self absorbed wittiness came across more as an enlarged ego than an entertaining and informative read. If you would really like to consume this book, I suggest tearing out 2/3s of the pages, eating them and giving them 24-48 hours to digest. Then, in the end you will have what you started out with in the first place."
2,Some interesting statistics but not much more,"At the beginning of the book I had hopes but after several chapters of not making it anywhere fast I began skimming. There was really no useful information on investing for retirement.For those just getting started, I would recommend Dave Ramsey's ""Financial Peace Revisited."" It covers most of the topics covered in ""The Number"" but also gives you details in getting out of debt, mutual funds, buying smart etc etc. Other good books on money: ""Rich Dad, Poor dad"", ""Total Money Makeover"", ""Richest Man in Babylon""... those are the first that come to mind."
5,Excellent book,"If you need detailed advice about where to put your money or how much you will get at age 65 from the Social Security, then this is not the book for you. It is for those who want to ponder the meaning of life in later years. The need for security , comfort and satisfaction are its main themes. I enjoyed it greatly and have decided to make some big changes in my life as inspired by the book."
2,Pulp Non-Fiction,"This book was a waste of paper and time!There is much false talk of how Eisenberg has hit ""the sweet spot"" on the back cover of this book. Bah! Humbug! Sweet nothings is more like it.Entertainingly and personably written, it is, nonetheless, as informative as a Jerry Seinfeld tv skit about finances.Eisenberg writes extremely well, but his efforts are all much ado about nothing in the end.Read the last two short chapters at the bookstore and put the money you save on this hardback book into your 401K."
2,The Number?,Overly simplistic and unrealistic. Not much help in planning for retirement. Mostly a bunch of stories for the rich.
2,"Good concept, mediocre execution","The idea of a Number specifying how much you need to accumulate to retire safely and comfortably is smart. However, the author wanders from topic to topic, story to story, and when you're 80% done with the book you start wondering if the author actually has any answers. Unfortunately, he doesn't. All the discussion is minorly interesting, but not really educational and it doesn't do much to support your quest for a Number. I ended up with a post-it note with some things to investigate more after finishing the book, but that's it."
1,Dont Waste Your Time & Money,"A total waste of paper - The author enjoys writing words, if you enjoy reading words go for it! If you want any guidance on aspects for retirement and saving for such, spend your time elsewhere - anywhere!"
1,Very little content,"I can honestly say that I learned nothing about financial planning from this book. In retrospect, I'm left uncertain as to what the book was intended to convey.If you spend a lot of time dreaming about having enough money to be free to do what you want, and you like the silly concerns of the lifestyles of the rich and famous, then you may find something to enjoy in this book. It does provide some examples of people who have achieved their ""Number"" and how they act as a result. It also tells hypothetical horror stories of people who assumed a certain Number was enough only to find out it wasn't.The book reads like someone who was out to reach his Number as opposed to helping you with yours, however. It is a rambling text that doesn't say much of anything."
2,The Number: What Do You Need for the Rest of Your Life and What Will It Cost?,"I was recommended to order this book and give it to clients who are planning for retirement. The books are used and some are not in the best of shape. I am not sure the books where legal to buy, however the price was right. [...] per book but shipping was about [...] per book. I guess it will serve a good enough purpose for what I plan to do with them."
1,Not as advertised,"I found this book very misleading. There's a nest egg on the cover which leads one to believe this about financial or at least retirement planning. And, the title says it's a completely different way to think about the rest of your life. It's not!The book is mostly musings from whiney people who lack real world perspective on living paycheck to paycheck. You won't find helpful or practical financial advice. And, if you're looking for a good read, you'll be sorry too. This is rambling and self-absorbed"
1,"Skip it, there are much better books out there","Even though it's titled the number, he actually talks very little about how to calculate it. I'm not sure what the point of this book was. It's really just ancedotes about his life. Read the 2 books by Gillette Edmunds instead. They are excellent."
4,A smart way to look at retirement,"The number is the dollar value of our net worth. According to Eisenberg, every one of us carries around in our heads a number that should we acquire it would generate sufficient cash flow to carry us through retirement. The problem, as Eisenberg points out, is that we frequently change our retirement desires which in turn causes us to keep tweaking the number. The point of the book is to suggest that the number is less essential than coming to grips with our emotions and assess what we really want out of life. A quick read yet a powerful ""punch in the gut"" truth that helps to focus on what is important. Excellent self-help book. Highly recommended."
2,"Great Idea for a book,mediocre book","I had great expectations for this book,what a great concept, with the baby boomers approaching retirement age more people than ever are focusing on what number will they need in their retirement fund to retire with.Lee Eisenberg is a great writer, however this book justs drifts around lightly touching on several different aspects of retiring, where to live,what will be the needed cash flow for lifestlye needs, etc. At one point he goes through a made up family and how each family member will have different needs. The book is like a long hypothetical ramble that never examines any of the issues deep enough nor gives any real solutions or solid advice.It is like discussing your predicament with a friend."
1,Save your money; save your time,"I almost burst out laughing reading the review above:""Eisenberg's arc through life could be used to define the baby boom.In the 1970s, he coined the term power lunch;in the 1980s, he edited Esquire and invented rotisserie baseball. In the 1990s, he wrote books on finding the good life through golf and fishing, and at the end of the decade, he joined an Internet retailer.""Stupid me for thinking this man would something about retirement and money!And, what little research I did tonight online shows- he did not coin the term power lunch- he did not invent Rotisserie baseballThis book is boring. This book is highly overrated. Save your money and save your time."
5,A Professional Opinion,"I am a professional (and fee-only) investment advisor, and the author Andrew Tobias is one of my heroes. His genius for explaining financial stuff is why I recommend his books to our clients. Similarly, I just finished reading The Number, and I am both amazed and captivated by it - I see many of these exact behaviors in our advisory practice. Basically, Eisenberg nailed it. I think he opened a subject of tremendous import for the next several decades. Boomers, advisors, sociologists, psychologists, and politicians will be studying these words for some time. Now, I'll be recommending his book to our clients!"
2,Couldn't find anything new in the book,"The author is humorous and kept my attention fairly well. But I can't say that there is anything new or earthshaking in his book. I don't really understand where they pulled the book's subtitle from. I didn't really see a ""compleetely different way to think about the rest of (my) life""What is your number? What do you live on now? Take that number to a financial planner and let them account for inflation and a conservative rate of return and they will give you your number: how much money you need socked away to retire.If you can't come up with that amount of money, then you need to change the way you spend. Period. But that is the part people don't want to hear.There really isn't anything motivational here either."
1,Disappointing!,"I was very disappointed with this book. I did not find it very enlighting and it was definately written for an audience who has lots of money - and thus not the worries of the ""normal"" middle class. The few bits of information found in the 250+ page book could have been communicated much more succinctly. I'm just sorry I spent my money helping someone else make ""their number"" - which seems to be the only purpose of the book!"
4,Made me think about personal finance in a different way,"When I picked up this book, I was expecting a how-to on growing your portfolio until retirement. What I found was a thought-provoking discussion of how many different factors play into your ""number,"" including happiness, charity, life-span, etc.Eisenburg rightly guesses that most of us are panicked about whether we'll have enough when the time comes to retire, but few of us are doing anything about it. He lays out a great case for being more frugal now and learning to avoid materialism.A brisk read that will motivate you to actually plan for the rest of your life."
4,Get's the reader moving!,"Look- this book is about ideas, not formulas. I just made an appointment with a Fidelity advisor and I'm motivated.Fidelity is going to be my ""mother ship"" in 10 years and I'm driving 2 hours to meet with a field office. The author gave me the idea after his comical discussion on retirement. Also, he brings the humanity into the equation. Thank God somebody has the huevos to bring up the fine points of where we really want to be after slaving for an employer . Living in a planned community is fine for some, but would be purgatory for me and he ""gets it"". Thanks Lee- I'm going to pass this book on to one of my buddies."
4,"About your attitude, not just your wallet","First, the Number is not a calculator. That's the point. It's really about the question that so many of us try to figure out: ""If I could stop working for money, what would that look like? How do I get there?"" It's an exercise in self-knowing.It's also one of the most stylish and well written books in the field. I wouldn't put this in the category of personal finance books but more in the Bill Bryson category of knowing, sly, and witty (but also informed) stories of a social obsession. Highly recommended to get you thinking while you laugh and shake your head. You'll find yourself in this book."
2,Meh...,"I love the idea of this book. Trying to figure out how much $ one needs to retire based not just on costs of basic necessities but also taking into account the lifestyle one hopes to achieve.However, I didn't find it well-written. He rambles, he throws in all kinds of random information and interviews around, but without really making a coherent, linear argument.And, good heavens! Everyone he talks to and all his own thought processes seem to lead to one conclusion: a person needs many millions of dollars in savings to retire in any kind of comfort.And you know, maybe he's right, but I'm not sure it's very helpful to his readers. I mean, surely the people who are capable of both earning and saving $10million dollars don't need a book, and the rest of us... well, does being told, ""your life will end terribly if you don't put aside at least $3million"" really help us to achieve that goal?"
2,"Witty, But Nothing New","In The Number, Lee Eisenberg covers some well-traveled ground with wit and humor, which makes the information a little more enjoyable than other how to books. Yet, there is nothing new to be learned here. In fairness, other than details on the various types of retirement vehicles, there is not much more to say about this topic than simply spend less and save more. Eisenberg says this, more than once and in clever ways, but little else. Read the reviews and take Eisenberg's advice by spending less, beginning with this book."
1,Only the author can retire on it .,Also duped by the hype.My retirement would have been better served if I put the cost of the book under my mattress.
1,Pointless and depressing,I thought that I was doing ok financically until I read this book. There is little or no financial insight or direction to this book.I really never got the point. It makes you feel that unless you are worth a minimum of 10 million dollars you might as well check into the poorhouse. I kept reading hoping to get the point and it was never there!
1,Not as advertised,"This book is promoted and is categorized as a financial (personal) book. It is not. The book strikes me as having been written off of the top of one's head. It is confusingly and illogically laid out. And it is virtually devoid of useable advice.Don't waste your money on this thin, overpriced book."
4,How to think about retirement,"As a baby boomer who can see the end of the work career approaching, I found this book to be extremely relevant. It was less about determining a specific number, but more about the process people go through as they prepare to retire. It was part a cautionary tale about the finances, although there are others pitching that (see Ben Stein at Yahoo, for example.) Others like William Bernstein do a better job on modern portfolio theory. But it addresses the important issues of what do you want to accomplish with your life, and what sorts of things lead to fulfillment, beyond playing golf."
4,Crankshaft Sensor,It worked great! However the bracket mounting part it wasn't included. I think each of these parts should included it. Besides this no issues after installed it.
3,A book you either like or hate....,"and I come down in the middle. It's a decent read and keeps the reader involved in the story, despite a few annoyances (like ""my dove""). Yes, Lucien is arrogant, but that's typical of most romances; he is, nevertheless, humorous and full of joie de vivre, and those qualities made him likeable for me. Jocelyn is a strong heroine, and the villain's use of her good works as a lure and a torment is effective. Lucien is very protective of her with regards to her family as well.An interesting side note on this series is that it's fairly innocent, making it appropriate for more mature teens. I actually read these books to approve them for my daughter. No, they're not Julia Quinn or Teres Medeiros, but I have also read many that are much worse (one of which was written by Lisa Kleypas). So take it as a light read and enjoy a few hours with a nice vampire."
2,"same story , different title","I bought this book along with My Lord Vampire and My Lord Immortality because they were cheap and a quick read. Or so I thought. I found it hard to continue because it was much like the first book My Lord Vampire!Same strong-willed, independent woman with a cruel family , same arrogant , tall , handsome, aquiline nosed hero. Every guy I think is handsome doesn't have an aquiline nose. Even the villians were the same . Same dumb tricks to get the Medallion , turning into mist , cutting Lucien the same as Gideon !The authors overuse of the word ""countenance "" is very annoying. She could have simply said face or features a few times but countenance was used everytime. Almost as much as "" my dove"". I am not going to read My Lord Eternity because I am sure it's the same as the other two."
4,Basic Electromagnetics for Graduate Students,This is a good introduction to EM for Graduate Students. Having been educated with the physics approach of Jackson this is an excellent EE aproach to electromagnetics (i.e. practical). The best recommendation I can give is that I actually own a copy.
5,Comments on Advanced Engineering Electromagnetics,"I am a graduate student at Rio de Janeiro, Brazil (Universidade Federal Fluminense - UFF) and this book is used on the following subjects: Electromagnetics III and as an introduction of Microwaves in the course of Telecommunications Engineering. All the students here, including myself, think that this book is excellent. If you have a good background on basic electromagnetics, calculus (including complex analysys), and love science, this book is a must-have."
4,First Advanced electromagnetic book,"For graduate students who want to study in electromagnetics area, this book is highly recommended to review and get more knowledge about what they want in the area."
3,Great reference - Horrible to read,"I believe this book would be great for someone with a physics background. Many reviews state it gave a helpful approach to EE.My background is EE and I found this book to be a great reference for my graduate EM classes. Although, coming from EE, I found it difficult to simply read this book and understand the concepts. He writes in a physics fashion and uses wordings that are unnecessary. To put it simply, he uses big words when he doesn't need to. He also uses a unit system uncommon in EE (at least in my experience).For my fellow EEs, I would suggest a book by Pozar, who attacks EM from an EE point of view. After learning the concepts from Pozar, reference Balanis to fully understand the topic. This is the process I used while studying EM.Another book I would suggest is ""International series in pure and applied physics,slater and frank - electromagnetism"". It's an old book and can be hard to find but it has a practical approach to EM without all the filler."
3,Open up and say Ahhhh :p,"I'm not saying that this is a bad book. It's just that Balanis walks you through steps of his proofs as if you're a mathematical klutz. He'll write out EVERY step in almost every proof, most of the steps in this book being trivial substitutions. He'll also repeat EVERYTHING for every single case (TE, TM etc...) This serves no purpose (except to give me back pain from carrying this heavy book) since:1. If you want to really understand the proof, you're going to have to do it yourself and figure something out yourself.2. If you just want to use the book as a reference, then all you need is the solution.Overall though, it is probably a very practical book for electrical engineers."
2,Maybe great...but had to stop reading.,"Maybe this book deserves 5 stars...I don't know.I simply couldn't get across the book..so many terms used subjectively.Also it focusses on groups, astral planes, auras, meditation, the occult.And I am a little suprised by the multitude of the use of the word ""men"" instead of ""man"" in general.Maybe great...but even as a serious spiritual reader this is simple too much assuming stuff for me.I did find 1 great quote in the first 25 pages: ""Glamour is the travesty of reality"".I would much more recommend any David R Hawkins comments about Essence versus perception.Altough Hawkins recommends this book, I think there are clearer and more down to earth ones."
5,Fantastic,"Helped me convert my magnetic whiteboard into an awesome calendar. I love the magnetic strips and lettering in particular, and it looks like it would easily help you make a tracking board of any kind. Unexpectedly fantastic."
4,Inspiring Work!,"This piece of work was better than their debut project. Over Blue City is one of the best Christian alternative albums of the year. Although they need some recover time from their first album, they will shine if they keep up the good work. The two best songs are #1 Viva Satellite, and #5 That's What God Does. They both have the pump up energy to keep a crowd going in a concert. If you like Seven Day Jesus or Painted by Moses, you will like Skypark!"
3,"Dude, where's my franchise?","I've been a fan of SSX since the PS2 Launched in October 1998. Each successive title improved a little on the previous one. Until now.Although the technical and visual polish is better than ever, some of the things that made the previous games great are missing from this latest incarnation, for no apparent reason. Major changes have been made to the trick system that quite frankly make pulling off the monster tricks way too easy. And though the environment and sense of speed is great some of the arcade like over the top aspects seem to have been tossed aside in favor of ultrarealism and an overall Tony Hawk vibe.I don't even feel like this game is really related to the SSX series and I'll be sure and RENT the next one before laying my money down on faith alone. SSX 1-3 are all time classics. This one, not so much."
1,Pure garbage,"I loved the earlier SSX titles, and it seems that EA counted on that excellent series to sell this complete garbage to customers. Its like the original SSX developers left town or went on to other projects at EA. Whatever the reason, this latest SSX release shouldn't even be associated with the others by any measure.Nothing at all like the previous titles, unfortunately.Borrow it or buy used (with a return policy...you'll need it) and see what I mean. Wanna save time? Move along to another game."
1,Killer of SSX!!!!!!! :(,"Every other SSX game was amazing. This one was very disappointing. I was at a store and I was thrilled to see it on the shelf. I spent (wasted) 40 dollars on this and started playing the second I got home. The music was horrible. The graphics were good. I hated the gameplay.This is baisically the game. There's ""The tour"" and your trying to get in 1st place. You get a better rank every time you beat a challenge. Another thing I dont like about this game is that you make a guy but you cant be any of the classic characters. Well you can unlock them but thats only for 2 player. And whenn you race against them in 1 player they are completely different. Like for example You have to race against Nate ( From SSX 3) And instead of being like a normal guy he is like a hick or something.And the point is that if you like the SSX seiries dont get this game."
4,Pretty Great,"I'm a big SSX fax, so I could just be incredibly bias, but we all love this games. All my friends, my sister, I love this game. It's A LOT different from the other games we love, like SSX3 and SSX Tricky, but I think it's in the good way. Personalization is different, some of the ways tricks happen, and obviously the mountain is a bit different, but I very much like it. I think it's a great addition to any SSX (even skateboarding) collection."
3,just plain boring,"the skiing is boring, the racing is this game is not competitive at all. im a skiier, and thats why i got this game. i have played ssx snowboarding (the old one) and i like that game better then this one. i dont like how its just one big mountain, and not seperated by slopes. the entire mountain are like double black dimonds, which are fun i must say. the game is kinda fun though, but it gets boring after a while"
4,a good sandbox cover,"I don't know what people were expecting from this. This is a high-end tarp, and it does what a tarp does. It keeps out leaves, sticks and the neighborhood cats. Water does collect on the tarp, and often, when you pull it off, the water dumps into the sandbox. But water isn't a problem, since it sinks into the sand (and kids like the sand wet). The problem is all the yard debris that gets onto the sand if you don't have a cover. And for protecting the sandbox from nature's debris, this tarp does a great job. It stays securely on and doesn't blow off. I've been very happy with ours. After six years of being outdoors all through our New England winter, it has worn out (ripped, faded, gotten a bit mildewy). I'm replacing it with the same thing. People who really don't want water to collect should buy a hard plastic cover."
2,"Works okay, water pools and green fades in one summer","I'd get again since there seem few options, but the item only took about 3 months in the sun to fade. Also, no matter how tightly the strings are pulled, water pools between sections."
3,Sandbox cover,"this cover is rugged, but to the point where it holds water and when it rains you are constantly bailing out the pools of water. I do not like the elastic type pull cords that are used to tighten the cover to the sand box. It is hard to adjust it without changing the positions of each corner. I feel it should have been made with one pull cord that when pulled would tighten the cover all the way around and evenly."
2,Not the best,"The cover comes with a big inflatable beach ball to place in the middle of your sandbox, supposedly to help the water run off the cover, but water still accumulates and sags under the weight of water, making big, stank, murky water puddles that end up in your sand anyway when you try to take the cover off. I personally would not mind the sand getting wet, since it would just drain out the bottom anyway, and wet sand is much better for play and building castles with than dry sand. Dry sand also flies much more easily into eyes. I just want a taut cover that will keep critters who want to use my large sandbox as their personal loo out of my sandbox. This cover does not do that, as the weight of the water pulls the cover in and creates openings where animals could get in. It also does not have very good UV protection, as my cover lasted one summer before fading, and three summers before ripping and shredding apart."
3,OK fit,"Had a hard time finding a large sandbox with a cover. Was happy to find this combo, but the sand still gets wet. A piece was missing when we installed it, but the company was very helpful with the replacement."
2,Mildly Disappointing,"I found that this cover accumulated water puddles even when tightened, and then started mildewing on the top. A hard plastic cover would be far superior to this. It is hard to put on, hard to remove (without getting water or sand all over yourself). It fades in the sun."
5,good,"It's very good. Very stable. Recommend its use. Has a visibly acceptable quality compared to the price, the better. Thanks"
5,Extraordinarily important,"The fact that this book is written by a relatively unknown writer and published by a solid, but non-establishment publishing company means that few people have or will hear about it. That's too bad, because it is almost painfully well reported, carefully argued, and thoroughly packed with facts, not opinions. It is a shocker, a real shocker. Taylor lays bare the double-talk and obfuscation that so thickly covers the issue of race in America, but he does so without rhetoric, even though his editorial point of view is both clear and determined. The never-before-told stories of ordinary people both black and white who have suffered under our thirty year regime of political correctness and blindness in the area of race, make this book hauntingly powerful."
5,"Superior Intellect, Superior Results","Other reviewers have done a great job of describing, in detail, the merits of this book. I would suggest to those reading these reviews that rarely is such a book given the opportunity of even being published. That is a straight forward, in your face, example of the power of the liberal media. Jared Taylor deserves our support and thanks for his efforts to persevere over the dark forces which would deprive us all of the knowledge contained therein. Information, along with thoughtful analysis, can overcome the prejudices of the inferior. You won't get this kind of honest analysis in most venues. The truth can only hurt those who rely on intimidation and mis-information to prop up their lack of intellectual honesty. Identity politics has become a growth industry."
5,Jared Taylor has let the cat out of the bag!!!,"This is no ""Rush Limbaugh"" talking here. This is an objective look at the unforeseen consequences of the liberal idealism of trying to mandate equality among races. Mr Jared Taylor shows that when you attempt to favor one group of people over the other you do nothing more than create another type of racism and inequalty. And trying to create the same playing field is almost impossible after Affirmative Action has put in place."
1,"Did not meet expectations, over priced","I found this book to be a very over priced item. It is not even close to being worth $70.00. My son also wanted ""Jedi vs Sith: The Essential Guide to the Force from another Amazon vendor & at $17....this was a much better buy."
4,Great coffee...,"Love this brand. Really strong flavor, and a nice little kick that you don't get from the ""organic"" coffee brands."
5,Bang for buck,"I just picked this one up and am very happy with it. used it with my nikon d70. Yes it is slow, but takes great pics, sharp sharp sharp, and for the money it is very hard to beat it. Im very happy I found it in time for my recent vacation."
2,"Love his other books, but...","It pains me to write anything negative about David Mead's work as I highly value and wholeheartedly recommend his other books, in particular ""The Ten Minute Guitar Workout"", ""Basic Guitar Workout"", and ""Rhythm - A Step by Step Guide to Understanding Rhythm for Guitar"". These are all great learning tools that would serve guitarists of almost any level well.But then there's this book. It's not bad, but it's not nearly as concise as his other works. In fact, I read it three times and still felt rather confused. Maybe I'm an idiot, but when it comes to explaining the CAGED system of organizing the fretboard, which is ultimately what this book is about, I learned more in 14 pages of Bill Edward's excellent Fretboard Logic series than in reading this book from cover to cover.Buy Mead's other books, especially if you're an intermediate or beginner. But if you want to master the fretboard, get Fretboard Logic. There is no other."
1,Choking Hazard,"The spout on this cup is very dangerous. It tends to crack and split apart causing small pieces to break off. I purchased two of these cups and within a short amount of time the spout on both cups cracked. Fortunately, I discovered the problem before pieces actually broke off in my son's mouth. I believe this product should be recalled and I'm writing to Playtex to make sure they know about it."
1,The instructions say do not chew on therefore it must not be for a baby,"because my little girl loves to chew on her sippy cups. I hate I bought it but I don't recall seeing ""Not for chewing"" on the outer packaging but the instructions say this is not for being chewed on. Also liquid pours out with no suction."
3,Spill -Proof Trainer Cup Ok not Great,"This cup is definitely spill proof. And the design is easy for babies to hold. The problem is that the baby has to really suck hard to get the liquid to come out. And since the mouth piece is hard, not soft like a nipple, it is not the best cup for babies under 10 or 11 months."
2,April Morning Review,"I thought that April Morning was an ok book. Being that the book was set around the Revolutionary War time period, I found it really hard to understand some of the language. I thought that it was kind of boring because im not really interested in book that take place in earlier time periods. If you are interested in book that take place in that time period then you will probably like it."
3,april morning,"I enjoyed Howard Fast's ""April Morning."" One reason isalthough I do not like history I beleive this book presents eventsleading up to the revolutionary war in an easier way then historybooks do. I think this is because the book creates fictionalcharacters and information along with the straight facts so it dosntlose you and you want to see what will happen next. Although this bookdoes seem boring at the beginning since it just tells about a youngboy having regular family problems and disputes, I beleive that allaudiences would enjoy this book once it starts to go into detail aboutthe war. The only problem that I see with this book is it goes into somuch detail about some of the scenes that it seems longer than itactually is. I would also reccomend that you watch the movie beforeyou read the book. The last reason I rated this book three starts isbecause of the ending. .... Overall I rate this book three starsand think it is a classic."
2,arghh,"let it be over please! snore fest! if you are interested in wars and action, not the book for you. if you want a love plot, this one is flismy and sad. we had to read this book for LA (and maybe it was my stupid teaches monotone voice or her many worksheets) and i found this book very easy to fall asleep during. i am one of those people who ca enjoy any book and this one was ok, ill give it that, but it wasnt a recomendation by any kind. if you want to learn about the revolution watch the patriot instead....much more interesting."
3,Nabad,"I must say that I am a history lover and liked this book. Being a big fan of the US revolution It had good descriptions of actual facts of concord and lexington. The book had good and interesting details but it seemed that this kid did not have any serious emotions and acted kinda like a wimp, which i didnt expect. coulda been better, coulda been worse"
3,Read it only if the teacher tells you to,"Despite being an American history nerd, I found it difficult to read this book. It wasn't the literary elements that were difficult--this book is written for children--or the events--the dawning of America's revolution--but the characters. Too much emphasis was placed upon the battles of Lexington and Concord and not enough on the relationship between Adam, the narrator, and his loved ones. His mother seems lukewarm, his father, though colorful, doesn't last long, and his girlfriend isn't emphasized nearly enough to keep a romantic interested. In fact, the most interesting character in this book, Adam's brother Levi, was deemed so unimportant that he didn't even make the movie version. Fast, who writes historical novels, concentrates more on the textbook actions than the personal actions of a boy becoming a man during one of the most turbulent events in our history."
2,It was ok. Not worth reading for enjoyment purposes.,"I read the book a couple of years a go and I saw the movie a couple of weeks ago, they were both bad. The main thing that I remember from the book is that the main character urinates his pants non-stop. I found that the book dragged on and included too many nonimportant details. The movie was a made for TV movie that I watched in my American History class. The acting was horrible."
5,good book for everyone,I read this book in my B2 class and i thought that it was reat. Howard F. uses great detail to capture the reader. He makes you seem like you are there and actually in the battle. His way of writing is a little confusing but it is easier to re-read parts to help you understand. Fast is a very good writer who is discriptive and uses resources to make it more accurate than some other writers i've seen do.
4,"""Alot of changes""",Hi this is ELise and my English class was reading this book. I was reading it and I thought WOW what a great story. The characters changed in every way possible. A very sad ending. I think the author should make a sequal
3,"Starts off slow, but gets very interesting.","I had to read this book for my language class at school, and from the ratings of the rest of the students, this book seemed as boring as watching paint dry. As I started to read it I was beggining to think the same thing, till I started getting deeper and deeper into the book. After about the first fifty pages, the book gets more and more stimulating. It made me want to read on, because I wanted to see what would happen with Adam and his trials. However, I think some teens will get a little bored at first, and will want to let the book just sit and collect dust, but read more into it, trust me it gets better!"
2,Kindle errors,The sample eBook for the Kindle starts out with part of the first sentence missing. Is this indicative of the remaining parts of the Kindle book? Waiting for a response from Amazon.com.
5,A must have in your personal library...,"This was probably one of the best books that I have read. It tells the story of a teenage boy named Adam Cooper, and his involement in the battle of Lexington. At first no one in the village of Lexington believes that the British are coming to fight. But when they kill Adam's father and many of his friends, he fleas. After he has gained control of himself, he goes out with his cousin and helps win one of the most famous battles during the American Revolution. This book was well writen, and it felt like you were right there in all of the action. I recommend this book to anyone."
2,What a boring April morning!,"I only read this book because i had to in school, and let me tell you something I HATED IT! Ths book drags on for more than 200 pages about war. I mean if you like to hear abou teverybody dying thatn you would live this book. But there isn't even any real action that takes place. The main character, Adam, is a whimp, as is the rst of his town. My suggestion is don;t waste your time or money reading this boring book!!!!!"
3,Alright Book,"In my class, for Reading, we had to read April Morning. At first, the book was a little boring. I did not want to read it and Howard Fast kept talking about Adam's family. Adam is the main character in the story. After the Redcoats came into the story, the story got very gory, but exciting. It kept my class wondering what will happen next. It is a good for eighth graders, but I think that if you go much younger, the kids will not enjoy the bayonets going into people's backs and so on. My favorite part of the book was when Adam wets his pants and does not want to because the Reverend is around, but the Reverend tells Adam it's okay because he has to. I gave it a three also because the author, Howard Fast, uses very descriptive words and phrases. I am glad we finished reading this book and got past that we did not like the boring beginning."
4,Something more,"This book was not one that i would coose to read but it was enjoyable.I would recomend this book to anyone interested in what was behind the Revolutionary War.If you already know the political and historical facts and figures of the war, this is perfect for you because it shows how people really lived and not just what you already know. It is more than a text book could teach you because it's about how war is for real people and not the government.It has a story about a boy who comes of age and shows how life was in the time of the revolution."
3,A Dark Time In History,"I think the book, ""April Morning"" was a good book. I thought there was alot of action and violence, which caught and held my attention. Although some parts of the story were very slow, other parts were very exciting. The author used very discriptive words to describe the characters and the events in the story. At times it felt like I was actually at a battle. I think this book is suitable for ages ten to twenty. This age group could really relate to this story. Even though the main characters are boys, I think both boys and girls can relate to this story. I also think that by reading this book you can learn about the lifestyles of people living during the Revolutionary War."
4,April morning,"I thought that April MOrning was a great book. It was very interesting and i learned a lot about the towns people from Lexington. All the textbooks that I have ever read only talk about who one the battle and what famous people faught in it. After i read April Morning i had a new respect for the people of Lexington, they had their families taken away form them and their towns destroyed all because the British wanted gun powder. I also think that Howard Fast did a great job in relating the present to the past. I think that it schould be part of the Social Studies curriculum."
1,April Morning,I read this book knowing that the story would go on for a space of 24 hours. Little did I know that the plot would be tiresome and the family relationships stereotypical. I found this book slow and dull and I could not bring myself to read it again. However the character Adam is fun to watch grow as a boy in the Revolution. The description of the Battle of Lexington was precise until I talked to a history whiz and realized its facts were not all true.
1,"Nice attempt, but no","First off, the detail in this story may attract some readers, but its realtion to the plot of the story is quite meaningless. As far as historical accuracy is concerned, the book falls far short of standars. The entire conflict at the North Bridge in Concord was not even covered, even though Soloman Chandler and Adam retreat to that area after the skirmish on the green. This is the pivital part of the entire engagement, and without it, the ensuing ambush would never have been possible. The description of life during the time should have been described in greater detail, so we can fully understand the atmosphere surrounding the family. I can't seem to understand why you believe the story was ""gory"". I thought the actual hand to hand fighting should have been described in better detail so the feeling of hoplessness for the colonists could actually be appreciated."
3,My Review,"I think this book was average for many reasons. One reason is, there was way too many pages of useless detail. Like when Adam kept asking himself if he loved Ruth. Also, the book could have had a lot more action. Instead of just having the Moses die, they could have had others die aswell. The only reason is the end was very good. I liked the final conversation between Adam and Ruth. That is why I rate this book with 3 stars."
2,My Review,"This book was booring! There was nothing in the book that a teenager today could relate to. It was extremely sad! When Moses died, that was the saddest part to me. It didn't really incorperate fiction and enjoyment, it was basically all talk. What little action there was, it wasn't really descriptive. The author could have elaborated on other character's thoughts. We all heard about Adam the whole time, what about his mother or his brother or his grandmother? The book should focus on the families in the war as well."
2,"boring for an 8th grader, good for a history lover","When I read this book, I was going into an 8th grade English Honors class, and it was a part of the Summer Reading. I must say, that I hated this book. All of the details were too much, and just made the read slower and more uninviting. Even though it took me two months to get through it, I give it two stars because it did have a good plot. Not a lot of people decide to write about such a short period of time, and especially to base it on history."
2,I thought this book was so-so,"When I first pick the book up it look very interesting. As I began to read it, I almost fell alseep because of the boring page after page with no paragraphs in between. Nothing! Zip! Finally, I was able to make it to the middle of the book. That's when it began to get more interesting. INTERESTING, for once I thought it would be boring through the whole book. I was wrong. As I got closer to the end, it began to get a little more boring, but in a way still interesting."
3,My reveiw for april morning,"I somewhat liked april morning. It was a quick read,but never really kept my attention.While reading April Morning my mind would constantly wonder so i would have to start the page over. Although this happend the book was very short so i finished it quickly. I did not understand some of the terms so i was confused for some of the book. I did like the action in the book because it wasnt to gruesome but it kind of made you want to read more. It was one of those books you would only want to read if you had to for school."
4,April Morning,"In class we read April Morning and it started out slow, but it surprised me. The book started getting good, and it was action-packed. It helped me learn alot and I had fun reading it too. Also, the ending was kind of boring and they should have had more battles. It was also kind of hard to read with all the old words and the religous words that were everywhere. For a book that I had to read in school, it ended up being one of the best."
4,The Best Review that you can get,"This is an excellent book for people 13 and older. The subjects in it can get a bit much for younger readers especialy things that have to do with love and war. This is a good book and it has vivid details about the time period and things going on. This book is about the development from boy to man for Adam Cooper. It is an excellent book and is very emotional. If you like historical fiction or even just a good intense book, this is a very good choice."
5,Required Reading,"This book should be read by all young adults, as well as adults of any age. Along with Howard Fast's book The Hessian, these books are excellent lessons in tolerance, compassion and war."
3,um ok,"this book was pretty rad. Some people think that this book has fowl lanugage and stuff, but who doesnt curse. Also, the book was kind of slow in the beginning, but once the British came to town is got better. Finnally, Howard FAst makes it seem like you are there by not say ing ""he said/she said"". This was my lame review on April Morning."
2,"I did not like this novel, because of it's excessive detail.","I had to read this book for high school summer reading and overall I hated it. There was too much detail and switching from the main character's thoughts to the events going on around him. There were times where the character's thoughts jumped around so much that it was impossible to figure out what he was thinking. The most entertaining part of the novel was the battles. These scenes were well thought of and well written. There was short and good detail about the transpiring events and the main character's emotions as he saw them transpire around him. I do not recommend this novel to teen readers, especially for enter tainment. I only recommend this novel for those who want to see an historical event as it occurs."
3,I think it was okay but got boring,The book April morning was okay to me. It had the talking and the action . I found that instead of having equal action and equal talking it was about 90 percent talking and 10 percent action. Okay 70-30 but still it should be 50-50. I thing it taught me alot about the revolutionary war and about our country. If it really came down to it I would read a violent book and just read this one for abook report or something
2,I Liked it so so,I liked kind of because of the action and the war. But the book kind of made me fall a sleep in my bed. I would always have to go back and read the rest because I would and not understand. I liked it overall but it is very confusing. It seems like it jumpted from one thing to another thing.
2,April Morning,"April Morning was a difficult book to read. If you skipped a few pages, then you would be completely off track. If you are looking for a book to tell you how life was during the struggling times of the Revolutionary War. You might be better of reading this book. I dont think that the ending really ties the book up. It is basically about this boy Adam Cooper who lives with his parents, grandmom, and his younger brother, Levi. He wants to go to war with his father and while he is there something upseting happens to him. He learns to live through it and he comes home from the war to his family alive."
3,"worth reading, worth buying","this may not be the best book I've read, but it's most certainly good. The book starts off with Adam, a young 15 year old boy whose wanting to please. His relationship with his father is less than thrilling, but after signing up for the war, Adam and his father begin to bond. But after a gruesome tragedy, Adam learns to depend on himself more and more throughout the gory war. He grows into a man rather than a boy and lives through death, through wounds, and sadness.A little slow starting off, but the book get's better. I liked how Howard Fast used so much detail in the deaths of Adams friends. For even more fun see the movie 'the patriot"" which is a very simalar story. Also read ""My Brother Sam is Dead"" as well, which is a little more child friendly."
3,my review for april morning,"I somewhat liked april morning. It was a quick read,but never really kept my attention.While reading April Morning my mind would constantly wonder so i would have to start the page over. Although this happend the book was very short so i finished it quickly. I did not understand some of the terms so i was confused for some of the book. I did like the action in the book because it wasnt to gruesome but it kind of made you want to read more. It was one of those books you would only want to read if you had to for school."
4,Hard to Keep up with but very interesting. <3,"I enjoyed this book very much. Although it was hard to follow, i got a pretty good understanding for it. It describes a young boy in his coming of age, but also his passion and his fight for his land, his people, his rights, and the well being of the rebel country.April Morning puts out a passion that i enjoy reading about. I guess i am a passionate person. A passionate person would enjoy this book just as i have. The american rebels needed their flower and their grain that the British so gruesomly destroyed. They had every right to fight and that's what was so great to read about. The average american would never think of all the hardships and sacrifices our founding fathers went through to get us to one of the most powerful country in the world.Passionately,Nathalie<3"
4,April Morning,"If you want to read an outstanding book about the Revolutionary War,I highly recommend April Morning.If you read the book you will get to know Adam Cooper, Moses Cooper, Levi Cooper, Sarah Cooper, Granny, Cousin Simmons, Ruth Simmons, the Reverend, and the dreadful British troops. This book is about the bloody battle of Lexington on April 19, 1775.Adam is always getting into fights with his dad.He never really knew his dad even cared about him until the day childhood left him and manhood took over- the day Adam signed the muster book, and joined the war.Pretty soon Adam learns more things about war that he wishes he never did-.Like death... In my opinion , any other book you read about the Battle of Lexington wll not be as interesting as April Morning."
5,syreeta enfin !,"heureusement qu'il y a des gens qui ont des idées géniales comme de sortir enfin certains albums sur CD j'avoue que je ne croyais pas voir un jour cet album remasterisé et dire que je l'ai déja acheté 3 fois en vinyl et k7 c'est dire comme je l'adore et je suis ravi c'est trés bien fait ,bon son , joli livret sur l'artisteune chanteuse méconnue à redécouvrir."
1,bad design for a spoon,"hard to imagine that someone can mess up a simple and common enough device but that's exactly what baby einstein did with this one. the handle is fat and heavy so everytime i left it in my baby's bowl, it became the perfect catapult. the baby hasn't started feeding himself yet but the spoon itself is making all the mess."
1,The Worst Bikini Bottom Ever,"No wonder that this bottom is placed in the under $24 category. It is cheap and fragil. The fabric is very poor. I was at a waterpark and was going to be daring and go down a waterslide headfirst for the rush. Because this was against the rules, my friend videotaped the act and also got many spectators to watch. I got by the staff person and went down. As I went down the friction (which isn't a lot) caused the strap to break off. This means I come down bottomless and give some a good show. After about 30 seconds, I notice in horror that I only have half my bathing suit. I couldn't find it. Then I had to go back naked to get a towel. The worst experience of my life and I will never ever forger it. I tell this story so a similar fate doesn't happen to you. I care unlike the makers of the bikini bottom."
4,"Good for the beginner, nice paper for the experienced","This is a nice book of general origami figures. For those who have never done it before, the book gives clear instructions and a good introduction to the basics of folding the most common and enjoyable of the figures. To you I would suggest reading ahead before you complete a fold. It will make the concept clearer for you and prevent frustrating mistakes.For those who have practiced origami for a while, there's probably nothing new in the book except the delightful papers provided at the back of the book. While not the traditional designs, these papers provide some pretty new ones motifs and some thoroughly delightful scenic designs that fold up into a shape that presents a unified image. You'll enjoy them, I think. I plan on using my copier to duplicate them for use in projects so that I can kept them nice."
1,Printer's error!!!,"I bought three of these books, new, through Amazon as gifts. They would have been fine, except that I heard back from two of my friends that pages 25-46 were duplicated, and pages 26-56 were omitted entirely. Seriously???!!! Beware!!!"
2,Hieroglyphic maps,"The Joy of OrigamiThis book is colorful and seemed promising for a beginner to self teach. The diagrams maybe okay if you already know what they are suppose to look like at each step, but as a teaching aid they compare to teaching American children from a hieroglyphic test. I bought another book on the same subject to help get through the simplest basics, but it was only marginally better. Van Sicklen is not a beginner's writer. This book could easily drive people away from the art through frustration."
3,A lot harder then it looks,This book is a lot harder than it looks and some of the things don't look like what they are supposed to even in the examples.... We will keep trying though as I love the paper themed for each project.
4,Pages missing but instructions good,"Our book was missing 18 pages, but Amazon replaced it for free. The instructions are easy to follow, and there are several illustrations on each page so that you don't have to keep flipping through the pages for each step.They use special paper for each animal, box, etc., which is distracting when looking at the final product to really see what it looks like. You just have to do them yourself and see how they turn out.The book doesn't seem to have all the classics, but it has a good variety. The best part of the book is the first few pages. They give instructions on the basic types of folds as well as instructions on ""bases."" For example, the first several steps you need for a lot of the birds use the ""bird base."" This is helpful when reading other books and finding patterns on the internet. Have the book open to the ""base"" page, and you're half way to making many other patterns."
2,Wouldn't recommend,"Of the 10 models attempted, I was only able to complete about 5. Thinking it might be me, I had a few friends try. Alas, they too were confused. Definitely not the ""joy"" I was looking for. Even though I purchased this on sale I'll probably return it. If it weren't for the nice paper included in the book, I'd have given it no stars. Maybe this book is good for experienced people but if you're a beginner and looking for a book, I'd keep looking."
4,"Good, But not good enough","The Origami diagrams are great! The book even has a page on how to do this fold, that fold, almost everything! The only things that disappointed me was that the special paper that comes with the book is gone quickly, and there aren't a lot of projects."
1,the worst experience,"The joy of origami? There is nothing worse than trying to create an origami piece with your child and get so confused by the instructions your frustration nearly causes you to rip the paper to shreds in front of your startled little child. These are the worst instructions ever. The idiot who drew the instructions made them so vague, you might as well be trying to build a nasa rocket ship blindfolded. There were allot of ""what the hell"" moments reading the instructions, and those were the level 1 origami instructions. I have not gotten this frustrated in a long time and found myself speaking roughly to my children. Parents stay away from this book. It is not for beginners, its more constructed for electrical engineers."
2,The Oddball Eloise Book,"This is BY FAR THE WORST Eloise book. So many people wrote glowing reviews that I bought it, but really... it's awful. The main thing you need to know is that unlike the other Eloise books, this one is all in VERSE, and, although I love Kay Thompson, she's no Dr. Seuss. If you need another fix of Eloise, buy Eloise In Paris instead."
1,Yuck Yuck Yuck,"My family enjoys reading the original Eloise. We even sought out the Plaza Hotel during a trip to NYC to see the portrait of Eloise. But....this sequel is just Yuck Yuck Yuck. It makes no sense. As an adult, I couldn't understand the storyline. I asked my daughter if she knew what was going on in the book, and she told me she didn't have a clue. I do not recommend this book."
5,Another Story CD,"The recent purchase of the CD collection of Ernest Tubb's recordings, Another Story was a very good purchase. I bought it as a Christmas present for my wife. She listens to it all the time and really loves it. She plays guitar in their band and was wanting to learn some of his songs they get requests to play. She has already learned how to play those. It was one of the quickest and easiest purchases through Amazon that I have ever bought. That is what country music should still be like.Thank you again,Britt and Cindy"
4,Beautiful Guide to Collectible Characters and Critters,"168 pages of beautiful full color, large photos, along with discussions of the major topics, including: Advertising Dolls, Bears, Barbie's, Book Dolls, Fast Food Dolls, Candy Connection, Great Comeback Ad Dolls and Sports Dolls. The pictures are so sharp you can almost feel the furry critters. A price guide is included. You'll want to add this to your collection if you like character and critter advertising bears and dolls collectibles."
5,fun and cute,My kids love the Wiggles so these stickers were the highlight of the month! They have them all over their playroom walls and move them around all the time. They stick perfectly and remain sticky after many removals.
2,Joe - Oh No!,"As a Joe Jackson fan, this comes off as a major dissapointment. Joe pulls off a fairly uninspired striped down live album recorded at NYC's Joes Pub. While it's nice to hear some of the old standards again like ""One More Time"" and ""Hometown"", he also does Duke Ellington's ""Mood Indigo"", which sounds out of place and sung painfully. His version of Steely Dan's ""King Of The World"" sounds strained. He should have put in ""Any Major Dude"" which he did so much better at The Bottom Line a few months before this gig. His musicianship is still very good, but you're left asking what's the point of this record? We can only hope that we get more of his quality stuff in ""Night & Day II"" due this fall."
4,"Great, even for a newcomer to Joe!","With Joe Jackson, it has always been about the music. Here, on ""Summer in the City"", Joe shows us that the music is what matters the most. Many of the songs really shine like ""You Can't Get What You Want"" in the stripped down trio format. Re-interpretations of long-time fan favorites ""Be My Number Two"" and ""Hometown"" convey a freshness and relevance, even though the songs almost 15 years old.Although no real new territory is covered here, although there are several great covers on the album, the band's playing is great, and Joe has never been in finer voice! Even if you are just a casual fan, or new fan of Joe, you will really enjoy ""Summer in the City"""
4,The Power of Three,"This is Jackson's first return to his rock/pop origins in a while and it is superb. His voice is strong and melodic. His piano playing is assured and rhythmic. But it is his rhythm section that deserve a lot of the credit. Graham Maby may be the best bassist since Jack Bruce. he plays the instrument as if it was a guitar and as a consequence what is only a trio sounds like a four or five member band. Jackson quite rightly gives him a solo part. As a team, the trio are very together and capture the drama in all the songs. None are disappointing, but for me the highlight is Eleanor Rigby. Jackson has transformed McCartney's stab at classicism into a heartbreaking and thoughtful classic of pop music. The Beatles are hard to upstage (Cocker did it with his A Little Help), but Jackson does it. This should be a single and a hit."
4,joe jackson-summer in the city:live,"""Look Sharp"" and ""I'm The Man"" say it all for Joe Jackson. After these gems he went the same way as Elvis Costello did(who both were born same day- same year). Downhill. They sold out. But, regardless, this disc holds its own. I'ts worth the money.J. Guida"
4,Quite a nice surprise for this geezer...,"I had never heard of Joe Jackson, and my excuse was ""What do you expect? I'm 63 years old, for Pete's sake."" My son gave this CD to me last week. As a radio DJ, he knows what's good, and as my now adult male child, he knows my own tastes pretty well. He thought I might like it. Well, I do. ""Summer in the City"" and ""Mood Indigo"" and ""The In Crowd"" and ""Eleanor Rigby"" are all songs I was familiar with, being a coot, but the new and original material on here is also fine. This is rock, pop, blues, jazzy instrumentals, R & B and a tinge of folk sensibility, all in one concert. Any real music lover who gives it a listen will find something to like here."
4,Well Done . . . Captures Joe's Live Show Personna!,"Being a fan of Joe Jackson from his early ""Look Sharp!"" efforts to the present day ""Englishman trapped in New York"" stylings, I was very impressed with his recent concert this spring here in Milwaukee. This CD, although directed at a New York audience, really does renew his concert experience and exhibits Joe's versatility in a live format.He truly is unique and covers material by the Beatles, Yardbirds, Ramsey Lewis, and my favorite - Steely Dan - in a very novel manner. It would be great to hear more colaborations with another transplanted New Yorker - Donald Fagan - to see what other jazz, pop, swing, or other sounds might ensue.I would give this a 5-star rating, but for the weak finish of the CD - a less than inspiring JJ piece.Definitely a MUST for any JJ fan collection . . . and a great introduction to any new fans looking for a truly original musician with a love for entertaining and the craft of music."
5,Great mix of recent recordings,"This was my first Grappelli album, and is still one of my big favorites. The tunes are classic, recorded from 1966-1992. There's a combination of Django-influenced tracks (violin, guitars and bass only), as well as some with the standard piano-bass-drums rhythm section. The album has a different flavor from the Pre-War recordings; beefier in terms of sound and harmony, but the swing is unbeatable. Perfect for a ""petit gout"" of Grappelli."
3,"Decent enough play, but no match for Crucible or Salesman","This autobigraphical work is written in a confusing ""Memory play"" fashion. This means that Miller jumps time periods, and fails to tell as fluid, coherent story. The writing is good, and the play could have been great. Of course, a bad Miller play is better than most authors' good works. Read it if you enjoyed The Crucible and Death of A Salesman, but otherwise stick with his more notable works."
5,It Is The Best!,"Arther Miller is really great, I'm not done with After The Fall yet but I think it is really well written!"
3,A painful play to write and to see,"Arthur Miller, having divorced actress Marilyn Monroe and married photographer Inge Morath, and in the aftermath of Monroe's still-controversial death, wrote this as part catharsis and part explanation of the recent events in his past. Treating Monroe as it does, it inspired a groundswell of revulsion for Miller that after forty years has not fully abated.Nonetheless, this is a fascinating work that on its own merits has some appeal."
3,Excellent Book For Beginners,"This book does an excellent job of explaining the various types of keno tickets. I was disappointed to find quite a few spelling and grammatical errors. I would recommend the book for beginners and for those players who are wanting to learn about ""way"" and ""combination"" tickets."
1,Pass this one up!,"Should've been titled ""The Very Basics of Keno"". Could have been written in the 50's. Not much on ""Strategies"". Gave a few complicated ideas, but not clearly explained."
3,Fast service,The book arrived when expected but it wasn't in as good shape as I thought it would be. There were a lot of markings everywhere even on the inside cover of the book with a lot of highlighting and notes but I was still able to read the text.
3,Civil Procedure,"It's just about as thrilling as a book on Civil Procedure can be.That being said, it was a better deal than at the campus book store, so that's something!"
4,Easy read,I had to get this book for civil proceedure class at law school. I had a copy of the 6th edition form a buddy but it was too different form the required 7th edition so I dropped the $90. School was selling them for $140 so get it here instead. I really wanted to save the $90 and use an older edition as I am doing in torts but the books were just too different and it was not worth it. If you need this book for next year or next semester you might want to wait and get a used copy.The book is very easy to read and the most similar to my undergrad textbooks.
3,Good but limited utility.,"I have mixed feelings about this book. On one hand it is pretty good for teaching the basics of civil procedure. If that's what you're planning on doing, buy with confidence. On the other hand, if you are hoping to use this as body armor or some sort of fortification you will be disappointed. I can say without reservation that this book will completely fail to stop even 9mm rounds. They went clear through. Predictably, it did even worse against 7.62 NATO rounds. To summarize this book can teach you civ pro but will be of little use in a post-apocalyptic survival scenario."
2,Pretty much worthless,"I actually liked my Civil Procedure class, but I hated doing the reading for it because it meant I'd have to use this book. The layout is thus: You read a case, and then you are presented with a series of questions that apparently you're expected to be able to answer on your own - in effect, you have to teach yourself Civil Procedure as you read. Interspersed with the meaningless (at least to the confused 1L reader) questions are little facts and tidbits related to Civil Procedure which aren't that important, but since they're the only information in the discussion section not presented in question form, you glom onto them in the hope that knowing said facts and tidbits will help to clarify Civil Procedure for you. All in all, easily one of the worst textbooks I've ever had."
1,Needlessly Confusing,"This book is basically worthless, except as a makeshift booster seat or placeholder on a bookshelf. I read this book, then I read the Glannon E and E. There is no comparison. Glannon illuminates, and Yeazell simply asks tedious questions with no answers given. My advice would be to use Glannon as your text and only use Yeazell for the cases.Also, I should mention, don't drop out just because you find this book incomprehensible. I did fine in civ pro using mainly supplements for learning the material."
1,Nonsensical confusion,"The author who wrote this book must have had only one intention- to confuse the reader. There is nothing remotely good about this book. It is edited very poorly to the point where it makes absolutely no sense. The author hides the true meaning to the cases. If you don't have a VERY good civ pro teacher, you will have no idea what you are reading. I don't understand why someone would take the time to write over 800 pages and deliver no purpose to the text. It is so bad that if I was an incoming law student, I would probably turn down a school if I found that they used this book for their civ pro course."
4,Gets the job done!,"My daughter wanted a little more light at night in her bedroom and requested a lavalamp for Christmas. I grew up in the 70's and know what a proper lava lamp can do. This isn't that...BUT..it is pretty and will do enough cartwheels and rolls to impress and lull to sleep. It does get hot though after about 4 hours so I always go in and shut it off. The directions said to keep it on for about 8 hours the very first time you use it, supposedly it fully melts the blob for future use."
1,Never worked properly,"Unfortunately, the lamp never worked properly. When the lamp was on and the liquid heated up, all of the yellow color rose in a big clump, pooled at the top of the lamp and stayed there. The movement of the liquid never functioned like a lava lamp. Then when I shut off the lamp and it cooled down, the yellow liquid clumped into a solid and stuck to the sides of the glass. I made the mistake of throwing away the packaging before confirming it worked properly, so I was unable to return it."
1,This lamp doesn't flow!,"We tried everything to get these to flow (we purchased 2 of them in different colors) and nothing worked. Takes ages to heat up, and then the blob just sits there and doesn't do anything - no motion, nothing. what a major disappointment."
4,Lava Lamp,"Received in a timely manner. Everything worked. Takes a little too long to heat up to where it functions properly, but not a problem...just have to plan ahead."
2,Lava Lamp,"This item was a disappointment to my mom. She was delighted with the idea of a lava lamp, but surprised that this one did not move as expected. As it warmed up, a slow blob moved into place and stayed put. Also we had to put the lamp on a timer so that it would not overheat. She loves watching the movement of things and had hoped this would work all day. It did arrive promptly and as described, but did not function like we had understood a lava lamp would."
4,Relaxing discovery!,"Love the lava lamp! Beautiful color, and so calming! After a stressful day of work, I switch it on, let it warm up and just watch it move. It has the same calming effect of watching goldfish, taking a hot bath or meditating. What a wonderful discovery.The only downside is that it takes up to 1 1/2 hours to get going (the colder my apartment, the longer it takes)."
1,Unreliable Quality,"I've got one of those and it was so cloudy that I was hardly able to see the lava. Plus the lava didn't move at all after several tries. I was very dissatisfied and returned the item, and got the same thing from directly Target's website. This time it's clear and works fine (though it takes about 2 hours to warm up, but I think it's normal for new lava lamps). So, I'm very happy with my new lava lamp. I don't know the reason, but I guess somehow Lava Lite doesn't have a good quality control on its products. If you're lucky you get a good one but chances are also high that you might get a dysfunctional one. So order it at your own risk."
2,Shipped with a bad bulb,"I ordered two of these. One worked fine, but the other had a bad bulb (broken filament inside the bulb). There is a warning to not use any bulb so leaves me confused about what type of bulb to replace with.The device overall feels really cheap and you have to be very careful not to top it over. You sit the middle part on top of a bulb in the bottom then cover up the cap on the top with a silver top. The silver pieces on bottom and top are easily bendable. I received mine kind of bent up and re-shaped it back to almost normal.So overall, bad quality and also received a bad bulb."
1,Wrong order,When I ordered this I was expecting B6 + B vitamins. Instead I just got B vitamins. So Im pretty unsatisfied with my purchase.
2,too heavy,"This already adds bulk to a heavy pda, but if you want to protect it this is the way to go."
4,An excellent book of source materials on the Holocaust,"A Holocaust Reader is an excellent collection of source materials. The book is divided into eight sections, more or less chronological, on the different stages of the disaster, starting with German anti-semitism in 1880, and running through the mass deportations of the Jews and Jewish resistance. Each section is preceded by a 3 or 4 page summary that helps the reader approach the documents with better understanding. The book has only two maps, a shortcoming for people like me who want a better idea of where things took place. But on the more positive side, it provides well documented source information and suggestions for further reading. I also found an appendix estimating the number of Jews killed in the final solution by country of origin to be helpful. This is an excellent book for fleshing out other Holocaust readings and by giving insight into the lives of real people during that time."
5,This Blossom will never fade,"Wonderful, witty and warm. Blossom Dearie is a national treasure and her late 50's - early 60's recordings for Verve make life worth living. There is no one like her in the world. Thank you for The Surrey With the Fringe On Top."
5,Classy Lady,A very good set.I love `Surrey with the fringe on top`. She`s in her prime here and the musician`s with her are perfect for her style. Looking for more of her album`s.
4,Nice price and sounds pretty good,"once you get the volume adjusted. This was better than a more expensive one I had purchased at the ""shack""! Was a grad gift- best part, you can use batteries or plug it in with the included adapter. Was afraid to buy as there weren't any comments so I thought I'd throw in my two cents. It's very light and I was pleaseantly surprised!"
4,Mini - Speakers - great sound,"This is a very good item for the size and price. Good quality sound and nice small footprint. Works great with my 2nd desktop computer where I am crowded for space but still want decent audio. The only problem is it does not want to ""sit-up"". Adding a rubber strip on the bottom might do the job."
4,portable speaker system,I like to take this and my mp3 out to the pool at night. Works great and easy to carry and set up. Plenty loud anywhere in the pool except underwater. Nice product.
3,Not shielded,"This little speaker has pretty good sound for its size. However, it developed a tendancy to have little power surge sounds. I guess it is not shielded, so I definately would not use it as a laptop or tablet speaker."
4,Perfect for my needs,"I was looking for something cheap to take to the beach and attach to my MP3 player. This fit the bill ($20), was light, and the volume went high enough without too much distortion. Just be realistic with your expectations..."
3,"Strong start, weak finish","When I first started reading this book, I couldn't put it down, I was absolutely engrossed by the story, the writers wit, and wondering how much was fact, and how much was fiction. Instead of writing a compelling, factual ending, the author chose to digress into this absurd scenario that has both the royal sisters going crazy and living out their lives in a remote village. It was ridiculous and dissappointing. Even though the book was written before DNA testing its still unforgivable that the author should have gone along with the theory that the Romanov's were still alive somewhere, a theory that is put about regarding other legendary figures who died tragically young, from King Arthur to Elvis Presley and Tupac Shapur. Why, if any of the Romanov's survived, would they have lived out their lives in obscurity? Its implausible, and Mr. Lambton's constructed theory at the end of the book is lame and unconvincing."
2,Title misleading,"I was very disappointed when I received this cd. I thought that it would be a collection of songs that have been on the show. I am a huge fan and was very excited when I found this cd on Amazon. When I received the cd and listened to it, the only song from the show was the main title theme. The cd is actually a collection of songs that ""inspired the show."" Amazon does not state this. It is in small print on the cd cover. HUGE disappointment."
3,disappointed,"I, too, thought that there would be songs on this CD which were featured on the show. They could have at least had sandi patty sing I'll Fly Away like she did in the 4th season. I also saw the commerical and it said that it featured a song by the ""Gaither Vocal Band"", but they don't have any songs on this CD. So, I was rather disappointed"
3,"Heavenly, but no T.V. connection","A nice, upbeat, inspirational collection, old standby favorites with contemporary arrangements...you can't help but sing along and be uplifted. However, as previous reviews before mine have suggested, it was a bit disappointing that such a long-running drama could not produce any original or T.V. related selections. Could NONE of the cast members contribute? They release music individually. Could none of the tracks have been at some time featured predominately in the series like collections released with ""Touched By An Angel?"" This is an enjoyable CD, but do not buy it if your motivation is simply because you are a fan of the series. There's no connection beyond the theme song and the cover photo."
3,CD was ok,Wasnt too happy with it. Even though I own all the seasons to the TV show 7th Heaven this cd was a little of a let down. Great show though.
5,Inspiring,Everyone on this CD needs to get more credit for their work on this album.The music was refreshing and very easy to listen to. Most of the artists I've heard and I think only 1 that I didn't but will look for more from that artist. This CD should be enjoyed by all.
3,Not exactly what I was expecting...,"This is not exactly what I was expecting. I really like that it has a piece for every single state (that was why I bought it) but it does not have a primary board in which to put all of the pieces. You just lay this stencil on a piece of poster board-like paper, which has all of the states names on it and the stencil keeps sliding around. Really wish I hadn't bought it and cannot discover this until you open the entire package. I wish the pieces at least had their abbreviations on the each piece b/c once you lay it over the name of the state (on the poster-board paper) and put it all together you cannot study the names of each state."
3,"Every state a separate piece, good or bad?","As a child I had a cardboard U.S. puzzle, and I have always felt short changed because the New England states were one big puzzle piece.I was looking for a U.S. puzzle for my grand sons, and when I saw that the Fit-A-State had a separate piece for every state, I was thrilled, my Little Men would not be short changed. :-)Now I have mixed feelings, those little states (pieces) are so very small, they are screaming ""LOSE ME!"". We haven't lost any states yet, but it is only because grandpa has been obsessed with keeping track of the pieces. The Little men are not as vigilant as grandpa.Over all, the boys enjoy the puzzle, I enjoy doing the puzzle with them, and I think I would make the purchase again. Just be prepared to guard those little states."
3,Piano Tuner,Does not work well with the upper 6 or 7 keys. 99 % of the time there is no response or the incorrect response. It's the same for the lower 7 or 8 bass keys. Using a pick up mic did not help. It is great from about octave 1 1/2 to octave 6 1/2. I would reluctantly recommend it to others.
2,KORG OT-120 Problem,"I have used two different units OT-120 and both tune fine (or display) the pitch center,but both units display a too large pitch deviation if the note is off-center.I just returned my second unit which I bought because I suspected the first unit being defect.No, that is obviously a KORG systematic error.Thanks God I own one old KORG MASTER TUNER, which operates much better than the new OT-120.(All tuners work better if used with an external micro and a pre-amplifier)If you want to measure the cents deviations of a tone, do not buy the KORG OT-120.Testing the SEIKO SAT1100 soon."
4,A very good tuner,"I'm a high school band director and I've been teaching for about 3 years and playing trombone for about 15. This tuner is incredibly responsive for such a small model, I like the fact that you can select different speeds for the needle response. The combo needle/digital display is unique and very useful. I use this to tune ensembles as well as for personal tuning on trombone, euphonium, bass and acoustic guitar and it picks up all equally well. I have not tried using it to adjust piano tunings as it claims to be capable of, but I imagine it would suffice in a pinch. All in all, a very good way to spend $90."
3,The SoundBack feature requires purchasing an additional microphone,"I bought this tuner principally because I wanted to use the SoundBack feature. Since the product description said there was a built-in microphone and built-in speaker, I thought I didn't need to buy anything else to use it. This turned out to be wrong. You can't use the SoundBack feature unless you also purchase the ""optional"" CM-100L clip-on contact microphone."
2,Not 8 octaves by a long shot.,I received my Korg OT-120 in a timely manner. I couldn't wait to try it out! I was severely crestfallen. It worked no better in upper and lower ranges than the $15 Korg tuner it was meant to replace. I would recommend to anyone to consider another product. This is not an 8 octave tuner even though they have named it so. Orchestral? Bah! I feel ripped off. My faith in Korg is gone. Look for another brand! I am thinking about sending this thing back.
2,Auto Mode didn't work!,"First time out of the box this Tuner worked properly after battery was installed. After that, the mode I wanted to use worked once and that was the only time it worked. That mode would be the Auto Mode with the dial pointed to slow, never worked on medium or fast in the Auto mode as well."
3,Accurate But Not Responsive,"It's very convenient to set this tuner to Bb while tuning a Bb clarinet.If you try to tune each note slowly, it gives you very accurate reading. However, if you play a few consecutive notes(not fast, just normally), it may show the first note and not move to the next, even when I set it to Fast."
5,Korg OT-120,I am a harpist in Brazil and I need a tuner that helps me tunning 47 strings quick and precisely in less than 15 minutes berofe concerts and practice time. Korg OT-120 helps me in this job.
3,limited range on piano,"This tuner seems to have a limited range for piano. It will not register the bottom or top octives, even with the external clip on mic."
4,Good tuner for the price,"I own G-5 Yamaha 6' 7"" grand piano, the OT-120 Korg works good for the first 7 octaves but the tuner cant seem to detect the highest octave notes so I have to tune those by ear, the clip on microphone that is recommended with it was not helpful , I found the internal microphone on the korg tuner was actually more accurate for my particular application.Overall it's a pretty good tuner for the $"
3,It may work for what I want.,I couldn't get 8 out of it maybe I'm doing something wrong we will try again. why the need for so many words
5,"Tired of boring cookbooks, check this one out!","My family fought over this cookbook when it arrived as a gift from my parents. Everything looked so tempting it was difficult to decide which recipe to try first, but we finally settled on the enchilada recipe and it was so good everyone raved. Now my family is calling me for the recipe, but are so disappointed because the new book was mistakenly taken to the library with all the wedding books. When I realized the error, I immediately called the library, but they assured me that a book like that would have sold quickly in their auction. Trust me, this book is worth buying and I will own it again soon!"
1,It's a notebook - not a story,"I am not sure what reviewer before me is writing about, but this is a small notebook -blank- not a story about about a girl, soccer, etc. But for a $1 it is a cute notepad."
3,All-star comedy cast makes this sampler worth watching,"What ""That's Entertainment"" is to MGM musicals, this compilation is to MGM comedies. There are some great moments here: Laurel & Hardy, Buster Keaton, and Abbott & Costello are shown to best advantage in lengthy excerpts from their vintage features, and there are good gags from Pete Smith and Robert Benchley shorts. The Marx Brothers and Red Skelton scenes are taken from their less familiar appearances. Producer Robert Youngson tried to cram too much into the feature, so some of the clips are very short (you'll barely see The Three Stooges, Bert Lahr, Jimmy Durante, Lucille Ball, and others). Still, there is a surprising amount of material from a studio that wasn't strong on comedy, and movie buffs should enjoy this."
3,Gameplay Good but.........,"Sorry to say that this game has failed to live up to my expectations.My major gripe is the graphics in between the actual game and the non discript music. In my first hour of playing I kept hearing the same comments over and over again by the commentators.On other football games I enjoy the tactics of managing a team and dealing with transfers, injuries and finances, I miss that with this game.The actual game play is fun though."
5,Awesome,"I had fifa 2007 but somebody told me to try winning11 pro evolution and I did, it is far better than fifa and since I received it, I never put the Fifa game in my console anymore. I'm will trade it for something else. Dont need it. Pro evolution is simply the best."
2,Rehash of a great,"This is basically a rehash of the concepts given in B.H. Liddell Hart's Strategy. The examples are different, for the most part, but the conclusions are exactly the same - almost word for word. Strategy is much better for the money."
4,Comprehensible,This book is omnibus reading and have great pictorial illustrations. I'm a hugefan of World & U.S. maps and this book has made is easier for readers to trek along certain terrains for vivid imaginations. Great book!
2,interesting but the value is doubtful,"It is a lively and interesting book, however, it is almost impossible to agree with the author on the conclusions - he is way too lightweight in my view."
3,"The closer in time, the less objective.","Alexander has written a nice overview of some of military history's best generals. His overall thesis was certainly proven well, and he chose those generals who best proved his point. I particularly liked the chapters on Hannibal/Scipio, Genghis Khan, Sherman, and Rommel. This work could have been a five star book; however, his chapter on MacArthur was where the book lost me. Militarily speaking Alexander continued as he had throughout the book, but his political overview of the Communist threat was almost as ridiculous as was Toland's in 'In Mortal Combat', which dealt with Korea. Hence I do concur with one of the other individuals who reviewed this work that his objectivity is lacking in his more modern chapters. Nonetheless, save for the last chapter, this was a good overview for someone starting to learn about miliraty history and strategy, or it is a nice refresher."
3,"Good, but could have easily been better","The choice of Generals to review did span much of recorded history, but huge chunks of history were missed. The first third of the book covers only 3 generals in all of recorded history up to 1800. Then the rest of the book (disporportionaly) covers the last 200 years. The review of campaigns was interesting, but some maps showed the flow of battles and others seemed to just be filler. The final two chapters on Rommel and MacArthur were done in too much detail. It became a deluge of unit identifiers and was hard to follow. All the recounts prior to these last two included not just historical review of engagement, but included analysis of what made the generals great -- not the last two recounts. I completely missed why reviewing and repreatedly reminding the reader of MacArthur's grand failure made him a great General? Finally, why were no naval and aviation generals included? Perhaps the book should have been ""How Some Great Generals Won Some Ground Wars""."
2,Not for serious scrapbookers,"I went to Vancover on a trip a few weeks ago and came across a big bookshop. I browsed the books there and noticed a thin scrapbooking book (with Lizzie Mcguire's head on the cover) in the children's corner. As a beginner scrapbooker, I'm constantly finding good materials to improve my scrapbooking skills. I flipped through the pages of the book and here are a few reasons why this book is so NOT worth the price:1. lack of information2. too few layouts3. too childish4. less than fifty pages!Honestly, this book is the WORST scrapbooking book I've ever seen! So if you're planning to buy some scrapbooking books to read, please remember to skip this!"
1,Do NOT buy this book,"Although the idea of scanning and printing out-of-print books is a noble one, this particular effort is criminal. It takes an important text and turns it into a piece of garbage.Consistently, the special Icelandic letters (, , , etc) are rendered as gibberish, and there's no excuse for this. The entire process indicates laziness and stupidity on the parts of the publishers. They scanned and digitalized the the text but were too stupid to realize that often less common fonts don't translate well. They were then too lazy to examine the text and fix this problem. The solution would have been simple: finding a set of fonts that accurately reproduce is not especially difficult, but it clearly was a task beyond the skills of those who produced this waste of paper and who then had the effrontery to try to pass it off as ""An Icelandic Primer"". It is NOT that book. The constant errors in the letters make the text useless.For shame!"
1,Simplistic,"I teach strategic management in the MBA program and do not recommend that this book be used. The cases are very dated and industry restructuring, as well as poor coverage of new technologies (such as the Internet), make this book tedious reading. Miller also fails to include several theories and frameworks (such as Porter's industry analysis) which gives spotty coverage to some areas. The international dimension is also very poor -- the assumption is that international environments are similar to domestic environments and a pursuit of profits (Miller's definition of success) is all that is needed in both for companies. Simplistic!"
1,Poor textbook,"This book was published in 1997 and written probably two years earlier. It misses out on all the developments that have shaken and rebuilt industries in the last 7 or 8 years. It also has very poor coverage of both classic and more modern theories. Yes, Miller takes a stand: but he does not give credit for his ideas (none of which are original) or cover theories that contradict his stand. This is not a good textbook for any level -- but worst for more advanced levels."
1,dated examples,"This book is old and shows it age. There are very few examples, and those in the book are over a decade old! A lot of changes have happened in strategy in a decade,... Avoid this book if possible."
1,Dump this one!,"We still use this book in Knoxville, TN, but not because of popular demand. Not updated in over a decade; old examples, old theories and unrefined concepts; excessively wordy without imparting much knowledge. Need I say more?! What are the choices? In Knoxville, not many, as Alex Miller teaches in the Executive MBA program, but elsewhere -- how about Hill or Wheelen/Hunger or Prahalad?"
5,Good Book,This book give lots and lots of example of today's managment using theories. It applies every stage of management or marketing. Love this book!
3,I HAD VERY MIXED EMOTIONS ABOUT THIS ONE,"The simple illustrations are nice and the text is quite readable. But...I am not at all sure I would want the kids reading this one on their own without discussion. The little froggy is indeed a typical kid with typical kid reactions. I found that be best use for this book was to discuss with the children just what it was the frog was doing and why it was so wrong and what some of the ramifications might be for his actions. As an example, I use the tooth brushing battle as a way of explaining just what could happen to teeth that were not brushed properly. All in all this was a okay book but the parent or teacher needs to monitor and discuss each situation."
5,A favorite!,"I was a little shocked to see the previous bad reviews of this book. Upon reading the concerns of parents I did come to see the observations they had made in a different light. Despite understanding how someone could conclude as they have, I personally must disagree. I don't expect this book to teach my child antics.What my daughter (nearly 2 yrs old) has learned from this book is how to say ""FROOOGGGYYY"" when she sees the word. At her age, she enjoys helping me ""find"" things, and enjoys froggy's searches for lost items. She also identifies froggy's ""brushing"" in a positive tone, and ""oops"" with concern that froggy has spilled water. This story relates to her reality. And, above all, it is the first book she has tried to ""read"" on her own.Nothing but positve results in my family! :)"
1,Night Time Disaster Since We Read Froggy,"In this book which our child loves, Froggy FINALLY brushes his teeth...and then...get this....he eats a bowl of flies AFTERhe brushes his teeth. Now our child wants a bowl of cereal AFTER he brushes every night! THANKS A LOT! Boo to the author."
4,Froggy needs a Spanking!,"The kids I work with love this book! As I was reading this, ( and discussing with them what was happening), if was so funny when one of the kids hollered out "" Froggy needs a spanking!"", thus the title of my review above. I don't particularly care for the back talk and stalling at bedtime,that's going on in the book, but kids do this kind of stuff sometimes. I didn't take it as a how to manual for disrespect as mentioned in other reviews I read."
3,PROBLEM WITH POLITENESS,"ON A WHOLE, I THINK THIS IS A VERY GOOD STORY. FROGGY THINKS UP MANY THINGS TO KEEP FROM GOING TO BED. MY ONLY PROBLEM WITH THIS BOOK IS THE WAY IN WHICH FROGGY RESPONDS WHEH HIS MOTHER CALLS HIM. I DO NOT WANT MY CHILD TO RESPOND WITH ""WHAAAAT?"" WHEN I CALL HER. I FEEL IT SHOWS LACK OF RESPECT TO RESPOND IN SUCH A MANNER. THIS DOES NOT MEAN THAT I WILL NOT READ THIS BOOK TO HER, I WILL JUST EXPLAIN ABOUT NOT RESPONDING TO ME WITH ""WHAAAAT?."" THANK YOU."
4,A fun book.,"A wild tale of classic science fiction, light read and funny story. It inserts hard facts every now and then, but in all a good story to pass time."
4,Classic Heinlen,This was classic heinlen and I enjoyed reading this romp through the galaxy. A interesting what if they were aliens.
4,For many years my favorite,"Not a true review but I cannot resist. Although not perfect, for many years this was my favorite Heinlein novel. I have, however, finally read it too many times. Even after all these years I know what is going to happen next from page to page to such an extent that I am unable to finish the book for the first time ever. Prime Heinlein though."
5,"One of the best, by one of the best","One of the great books, ""Have space suit, will travel"" has a lot of heart, and excitement, while remaining insightful and meaningful. If you can't enjoy this ""best and most beloved"" of books, there is probably something wrong with you."
4,Have Spacesuit--Will Travel,This is a very old science fiction book that was actually quite imaginative for its time. I was impressed with the ideas of how to walk on the moon expressed by the author long before anyone ever walked up there on the moon. Fun book.
3,"A Children's Novel, But Entertaining Nonetheless","Due to how much I absolutely loved Stranger In A Strange Land, I picked up this little novel.Unfortunately, it's a kid's book. Not that this novel was not interesting because it was, just that it was no where near as good as Stranger In A Strange Land.The story is about a boy who wins a real spacesuit. He unwillingly must save mankind. It started off pretty slow and childish I thought, but then you really get into it. It becomes and adventure novel with Kip (the boy) getting whisked into space and having all types of adventures. I can't say I didn't like this one."
3,Too detailed for the genre,"I've read lots of Heinlein and generally like all of his Golden Age books (I loathe his later writings). This one however, I did not like. It reads like a juvenile novel (which it is) but it just gets bogged down with details. He goes on and on to describe jury rigging the spacesuit, for example. In another format this might work, but with the type book this is,the story is more important. the details just seemed like filler."
1,Atrocious!,"The worst book by Heinlein by far (I have read at least 10!). One of the worst sci-fi books I have read in my life! Incredibly childish, primitive and boring! It's really hard to believe that such a great writer came up with this."
5,Book,Good book I liked the description and drama it built a good picture in my mind. I would rate this book 5 stars n matter what.
4,Fun,Heinlein never misses his mark. This was another good read of science fiction and a lot of fun A quick read.
3,"Good story, overpriced E-book","This did ask me to review the ""product"" so I can't ignore the fact that this is overpriced for electronic publication. The story I would rate 4s is not for the abusive pricing practice of this publisher."
4,A boy a girl go on an adventure on different planets.,It is a very exciting fast moving book. It has very interesting characters. I think it is worth reading.
5,It is a great book.,"It was the first science fiction book I ever read and it got me hooked. I read it and then said to myself,""This is a great book."" Ever since then I have loved to read, especialy scince fiction. I have read almost every book by Robert A. Heinlein and this is one of his best"
5,Great book for adolescents & teens,"Robert Heinlein wrote two kinds of science fiction: adult and adolescent. Have Space Suit, Will Travel is one of the best for the younger reader. It's a great adventure story, and has a lot of good lessons for today's teens, who seem to think they can have the world for nothing. Lessons like ""you are the result of your decisions"" and ""your education is up to you"" and so forth. It also holds a lot of hope for humanity as we grow up and join the other beings in the Universe."
4,"What ever happened to those ""essay"" contests anyway?","In a novella where the main character can win a space-suit by writing a slogan for soap in one of those ""Box-top"" contests and the story not end up being cheesier than some B-rated movie, it has to be good. This novella is definitely worth reading. It is simply an adventure story, with many odd twists and turns, but yet it makes a reader feel good. If you have a spare hour or two, I suggest reading this book."
5,A great book for a first time Heinlein reader,"Like many of the others here, I read this about the third grade. It was my first SF book and I've been hooked ever since. For the young person (or any age, I supose) it grandly illustrates the values of determination and preparedness. As one of the characters stated, ""luck"" is something that happens to people who prepare for it. Because Kip had a spacesuit, he was able to go to the moon, Pluto, and even another galaxy. I've seriously thought of getting my own space suit, to be ready for a similar opportunity!Though written for the young reader, I enjoy this book as much at 40 as I did at 8. Highly recommended for any age, but especially for young folks."
5,Best Book I've ever read!,"This is the best book i've ever read! It has a great plot and charactors! I didn't care wether it was ""dated"" or not! It also has lots of facts in it that make it realistic."
5,My first SF story - age 8,"This was the first SF book I read as a child. I was immediately hooked. From that point over the next 28 years I read an average of one SF book a week. SF was largely responsible for my later love of mathematics, science and especially computer science. It taught me that real magic was there. Otherwise the typical dreary public school math and science courses would have bored me to tears. I owe so much to SF and especially to this giant of the genre."
4,Good fun,"For those who are into audio books and enjoy Robert Heinlein's works, this is well worthwhile.As stated, it is the unabridged text of the book omitting only the ""he said"", ""she said"" type phrases since different performers do the various voices. When there is a description of how the person said it, that description is included.I first read the novel decades ago when I was either in late elementary school or middle school. I still enjoy this novel today. The audio performance is just as much fun as reading the book.Overall it is well done. However for the chapter breaks, they use the old type of spooky sci-fi music. This is not needed for this book and I personally feel it slightly detracts from the overall performance. This is really a minor flaw though."
3,Looks good in the picture,"I SO wanted these to be as yummy and decadent as they look in the picture. They are not bad, they just aren't as rich and chocolaty as ""double chocolate dream bites"" implies. Maybe that is a pitfall of being gluten free? I don't think so..."
2,"Pretty, but useless.","While this keyboard will add pizazz to your desk or your child's room, it is light and cheaply made. Moreover, the keys are either unresponsive or too sensitive. If you want a nice looking keyboard, buy it. If you actually need to type, skip this and look elsewhere."
2,Sorry: more like jazz than zen...,"First, this is a very short cd: only forty minutes. Second, although the string instrument(koto)sounds pretty much Eheiji-like, the flute, definitely the dominant instrument on this cd, sounds more like New Orleans jazz than zen, which is quite disturbing, to say the least. The first piece ends quite abruptly, which is a disaster if you are meditating.I was thoroughly disappointed and it was hard to remain calm and centered thinking of the wasted money. It landed in the garbage can after just one try.How other people could write raving comments about this cd is a something of a koan to me.I recommend Sanctuary by Riley Lee, which is real Japanese and Zen and is 61:19 minutes long!"
3,Too heavy-leaves a depressing feeling,"I love ambient/new age but this is too ""heavy"" and down for me. It sounds not just depressed but despairing. It could be those plaintive instruments. Not something I want to relax to."
5,A piece of history and a peaceful listen for today,"I remember when this first came out as an LP. This one and Paul Horn in the Taj Mahal were sooooooo bizarre!These guys were really playing from a different place entirely. You wondered where did Tony Scott get so much meditative insight to put in his clarinent? Even the cover itself was really off the wall,even for the 60's.So here we are 35 years later and it sounds great. If you enjoy mdeitative or ambient music, this is one of the prime sources of it's origin. You can't go wrong with this in your collection. It's certainly a piece of history but more important, it's a peaceful listen for today."
4,"Beautiful, serene","Whatever the benefits of using this beautiful music for meditation, I can tell you that it's just marvellous for listening to!The CD is a collection of solos, duets and one trio, mainly dominated by the sweet clarinet of Tony Scott and the koto. Shakuhachi is also here, but to a lesser extent than the other instruments. (For some of the finest shakuhachi playing you'll here, do a search for Riley Lee on Amazon)The disc comes in an elegant digipak with a very informative booklet.This is haunting music which - to my western ears - sounds at once alien and also familiar. It's not a long disc by today's standards, but don't be put off by that. Every note is in the right place and it would have been a dreadful error to add ""bonus tracks"" that broke the mood. Highly recommended!"
5,"Wonderful, Relaxing & Soothing","This was the first meditation/spa cd I have ever purchased, but it will definitely not be the last. The soothing instrumentals provide the perfect escape after a long day. It's wonderful for meditation, yoga workouts, or sleeping. I've also found it to be quite relaxing as background music while working on the computer.* Wow I am so very glad that I took the plunge. It's beautiful!"
5,Zen,I have listened to this album for decades. I had it on a vinyl and then transferred it to cassete tape. I was so happy to see it on CD. It is the best ;of the best.
5,The One,"This is one of my favorite movies, especially Jet Li, and the BlueRay just makes it 1000% better. I love it. Thank you."
3,Jet li will always be awesome to watch,"Not my favorite Jet Li movie, but if you like hard hitting martial arts this could be your film. Don't go by my three stars, see it for yourself. I just didn't care a lot for it"
3,"Read it for ""fun""","This is not a reference text by any means. It is a quick question and answer approach to neurology. This book is best read by those who already know some neurology and want to gain some additional knowledge. Some things seem trivial, others practical. Probably not a good book for students or 1st year residents in neuro."
1,Worst baby book ever,I bought this on the great reviews. I should not have listened. This book is all about the author. Notice her name prominently displayed on the front cover. The drawings are cute but there are too many pages on items that should take a couple of lines. This book is all about making the authors' art look nice than telling the story about your baby. I w rote a few lines in it already and then got mad so I can't return it. Now I must throw this away and get another baby book.
4,Classy and charming- not overly cutesy,"I love this baby book! The pictures and pages have all the essentials plus a hundred things I never would have thought of. Although I love it, my one complaint is that it has a little too much and is a bear to fill it all out. For example, there is a ""responses to nature"" page, a ""clothes"" page.... I just changed them but it does look a little messy with me putting stickers to cover up the strange headings. Overall it is a cute and classy baby book with everything you could want."
4,Pretty Good,It was actually really good I thought it would be lame but it surprised me. Rags verses Disney's Let it shine? I'd say a tie.
1,Beware Penguin Incomplete Edition!,"I ordered the one with ISBN 978-0-141-04257-2 not knowing it was a flimsy edition with only four of the 13 chapters in the real book! The original (out of print, but available through various online sources) has a waterfall on the front. ISBN 0-486-29167-7 is the real book."
1,Small Text,"This product is not worth the money. I recently purchased it for an American Civilization course, and aside from it being incomplete, the pages are just small, scanned photos of the actual work. Almost all of it is illegible because of faded, blurred print, and much too small to read even if the ink wasn't faded. I am extremely disappointed. It is a useless 17 pages and a waste of $13. NOT WORTH BUYING AT ALL! (Do not buy the one with the ISBN number 9781179557915)"
4,Hell of a collection of female singers in one LIVE recording cd,"This is one of those moments when Cheerness is not enough to describe the marvelous experience listening to these ladies of music! Just check this out (good and bad): Mariah Carey: the best 90's R&B and top selling singer, thou not her best songs to perform. Celine Dion: is there anything else to say about her and her wonderful high pitched vocals?. Aretha Franklin, need to say anything?. Gloria Stefan: the latin lady of the ladies, she adds some chili,latin dance and her wonderful charisma to the performance.Shania Twain: although her performance is really good and she was a diva in the 90's I guess I would pick up Madonna, since she was, is and will be a diva forever! The duets, and final jamming lead by Aretha are just moments of unfathomable joy. Just get it, if you like REALLY GOOD POP with R&B and exceptional singers just give it a shot!"
5,Awesome,"Good quality music and the ladies of the night were electrifying. Celine, Gloria, Shania and Carole pulled off a great performance singing the song ""You've Got A Friend"". A must have CD!"
1,Divas Live,"Divas Live is my 15th SACD disk. It's a horrendously poor recording! I am shocked. My previous SACD disks have all been from very good to jaw-dropping amazing. This recording (...) big time. Tizzy, harsh highs, thin midrange... just pathetic. The music is fine but I'll probably never listen to it again. Unacceptable for an SACD recording, IMHO."
5,ITS PUTS FAITH BACK IN CONCERTS!!!,"WELL LET ME TELL YOU PERSON WHO THINKS CELLINE IS GETTING FAT WHATEVER!!!! CELINE, SHANIA, ARETHA, CAROL, GLORIA AND THE AWESOMEST MARIAH CAREY!!! COMBINE TO MAKE THE BEST CONERT EVER AND VH1 CHER AND TINA ARE AWESOME BUT THIS MAJIC WON'T BE RE-CREATED!!!"
4,Enlightening and fun,"To have all of those singers in one room, is what makes this CD worth listening to. When all of the divas sing together in the end, it will send chills up your spine to know that these great artists worked hard for a great cause- Music for Kids."
5,ridiculous,"This is of course for fans William S. Burroughs only, a claymation short starring a warm-hearted junkie. Familiar Burroughs lines will have viewers cracking up during this little heart-warming vignette from the seedier side."
2,"Good movie, poor dvd","The movie ""The Junky's Christmas"" is great clocking in at only 20 mins. It is a must have for any Burroughs fan. Anyone considering purchasing this should be fairly warned that you only get 20 minutes or Burroughsy goodness for your $17.99 (amazon price at time of writing). The other two shorts are not Burroughs related and are horrid. To sum it all up, if you are like me and like filling your entire house with dvds you'll only watch once then by all means buy this. Otherwise don't."
1,Disappointed with amazon,"I would like to review this film, however, having ordered it on Nov 30, and today's date being Dec 28, I still have not received my order."
1,Not worth the paper it's written on,"Not what I would call a well written book.Not even what I would call a factual book.That being said, I'd suggest that if Richard Ramirez fascinates you, and you wish to learn more about him and the crimes that he committed pick up a copy of Philip Carlo's book ""The Night Stalker: the life and crimes of Richard Ramirez"". Carol's book is a much better documented account of Ramirez, due in part, because Carlo actually interviewed Ramirez numerous times.If you really don't care that the information is correct or you just want a macabe story to read, then by all means, get this book. Otherwise, buy Carlo's book, you'll be happy you did."
1,Save Your Money,"After reading Philip Carlo's book I wanted to know everything I could about Richard Ramirez. Instead of taking advice from all the reviews on this book I decided to read it for myself. Big mistake! First off, the book skipped so much detail and most of the details in this book were totally wrong. You can google the Night stalker and get accurate information then what this book gives. Do yourself a favor and learn from my mistakes, trust the reviews, save your money and buy Philip Carlo's book instead. I had to put this book down and couldnt even finish it."
2,Not too good,"There are a few nice tracks on this album but it was largely a disappointing experience. It seems like most of the tracks were experiments by the artists in their own styles, styles remote from that originally intended by Porter."
1,Don't Bother....,"It's obvious by the multitude of five star reviews that people love this movie. For the life of me I cannot figure out why. I really wanted to like this movie. I watched ""South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"" and ""Team America"" and laughed throughout both of those films. Where both aforementioned films succeeded in keeping me entertained, ""Baseketball"" fell very, very short. ""Baseketball"" is a film overwrought with bad acting, worse jokes & one of the most asinine plots I've seen in any comedy ever. I know that comedies aren't known for intricate, balanced plot lines and stellar acting but I seriously didn't think this movie was going to be that bad. The only interesting thing about this movie were the cheerleaders, but even in all of their scantily clad glory it's not enough to save this film."
5,dude that was cool,man that movie was great i liked the part were squeeky had a mask and was trying to anoye the other player and it didn't work so he took of the mask and the guy fell over.
1,You'd expect more humor from the creators of South Park,"I was looking forward to seeing this film, when I did it was a disapointment. South Park is funny. You'd think these guys would be AS funny. No. This film was like Airplane or Naked Gun, but not funny. I wouldn't buy it or rent it."
4,Silly Funny,"I enjoy silly comedies and this is no exception. I liked the satire of the various major league entities in the world today. All in all, this was a great purchase and amazon delivered as expected. I still laugh at this movie and most of my generation would, 20-30."
3,Christmas gift,This is a xmas gift so a review would have to come from him and that won't be for at least 4 months
3,Has its moments,This is worth watching there are some funny scenes while others drag on too long. The guest stars will surprise some.
3,"Good movie, not so great DVD","Surprisingly, although I'm a fan of the film, I couldn't help but be disappointed - and distracted - by the obviously out of synch dialogue dubbing, a problem which continues through the first 1/2 of the disc. Since I saw it in the theater, I'm fairly certain this is a problem with the DVD version only. Worth getting, but annoying to watch at times."
4,One word.....Trey Parker and Matt Stone,"Although, this movie only grossed 7 million [very disappointing] it is very, very, very funny. Matt and Trey definately have talent and it shows onscreen. (i.e. see orgazmo) I'm sure 98.9% of Americans disagree with that statement, but everything about BASEketball is hiliarious due to the fact that it made me laugh like no other film I had ever watched. Everyone who hasnt seen it should at least just give it a chance and not just blow it off cause they only know Trey Parker and Matt Stone as those goofy creators of South Park."
2,Good movie,"This is a funny movie, however, the case for the DVD was in pretty bad shape. It was cheap so I guess I shouldn't complain."
3,Who knew that this movie would have subtle humor?,"BASEketball has its regular share of pratfalls and sight gags, and twice as many one-liners. When I recently rented it, these were expected and, as I was in the mood that day, welcomed. Where I really laughed, though, was when the humor went more subtle.A good movie fan will love when Parker and Stone, trying to save a child in a hospital, pause to bounce movie lines off one another. The chemistry between the two, best friends in real life, shows through--even with a script that doesn't get as cerebral as ""Airplane!"" or ""The Naked Gun"". (Yes, I said ""cerebral""...) The real humor in BASEketball comes out when these two very funny guys seem to be ad-libbing, whether or not they really are.Funniest effort by Parker, Stone, or director Zucker? Certainly not. Worth a viewing for some gut laughs? Certainly."
5,What more can I say?,"What more can I say about this comedic masterpiece. Is there anything that Trey Parker and Matt Stone can't do? They have looked into the face of adversity and farted right back at them Terrance and Philip style. This movie is a gem from start to finish. Trey keeps the slapstick going the whole time, something Family Guy likes to rip off of the comic duo often (as we have seen in a recent episode of South Park entitled ""Cartoon Wars""). The best thing about this movie is Kenny AKA ""Little Bitch."" When I thought i could't laugh anymore, his character always took it too the next level (much like in Orgazmo as well).To be honest, the minute I finished watching this movie I got my buddies together and tried to play this wonderful front yard game. It didn't last too long, but the laughs from this movie will."
4,You Can't Help But Laugh,"South Park writers and creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone star in this hilarious film ""BASEketball"" as they form their own professional sport and find themselves lives. While being loaded with outrageous moments of sheer hilarity, this film also has a statement to make about how professional sports are money hungry. Through the combined rules of baseball and basketball, Joe Cooper(Trey) and Doug Remer(Matt) find themselves a new sport that requires know athletic skill whatsoever. There talent lies in the ability to psyche out the opponent, and they certainly have great success doing so. Filled with great cameos, great scenes in the hospital, and during games, this a great comedy for any fan of South Park. The humour certainly has its moments of grossness, but it is a pleasure to watch. Highly recommended."
1,"Vile movie not shocking like South Park, therefore not funny","South Park is funny because it shocks you. It does things that just make your eyes open wide and scream out ""Oh My Dear God!!"" Your only defence system is to laugh. I still remember the first time I saw poor defensless Kenny get decapitated and the look on my face. Baseketball just repulsed me where I had to turn my head in defence. I'm not going to get into much detail, because I do not want to ruin any of the ""jokes"", but they're just bad and lacking any real wit that can be seen in South Park. Most of these jokes can be seen a mile away. There is the odd laugh (there was one or two where I was laughing hard I will admit), but overall, it was a painful 2 hour (!!!!) experience.--wcg"
1,BASEketbomb,"It's hard to believe these two imbeciles are the same guys who write Southpark. Everybody kept telling me this movie was hysterical, so naturally I rented it thinking it would be worth the money.To say the *least*, I was so disgusted with how saturatingly idiotic and boring this movie is, that I actually demanded a refund from Blockbuster (and told them the true reason as to why). They of course didn't give me the refund, but oh well.I can't recall even a single moment during this movie where I laughed.The only part that amused me (very slightly, mind you) was when the guy got catapulted through the rafters of that building. Other than that, I'd say this movie is a total disaster, and I'm very surprised it was even allowed to be made with a script this ....."
1,I would rather have colon cancer then see this again!!,This movie is the worst comedy(if not worst movie of the decade)of 1998. To the reviewers who say it is the best movie ever they must be under the influence of some substance or homosexual like the two actors who tried to pull in more money off their Southpark fame. Theatres that showed this movie should shut down and anyone bored enough to see it 8 times should seriously consider suicide.
1,TOTALLY TOTALLY AWFUL!!!,"I saw this when it came out, watched it once--but not all the way through and then got rid of it. It was SO very tacky. It was very, very low budget. Poor acting. Ignorant.These guys need to stay behind the scenes and do South Park. Their over-the-edge humor and voices are more histerical than their acting.Stay away from this film. (gag) And watch South Park instead."
5,kick-ass!,This movie rules. Its one of those you have to watch about five times just to get all the funny shit in it.
2,Am I missing something...,"I tried watching this movie....twice! I absolutely love South Park (written and voice overs by Parker & Stone) but this movie was incredibly stupid. Yes, it is vulgar like South Park but in a kinda forced way. You may enjoy it but I didn't."
5,Baseketball,I bought this as a gift and it came in perfect timing. The DVD is in great condition and of course the movie is hilarious!
3,great movie,Ridiculous movie! So hard to not laugh. The only thing I don't like about this product is that I wish it was BLU-RAY. As far as I know they haven't made it on BLU-RAY yet.
4,This movie is the best of its suffering kind.,"There are sports movies, that end up being rather stupid and cheesy. At the least, this movie escapes the horrible downfall of most of it's basic genre. I think the reason is, that it is basically teen humor, that teenagers will enjoy, yet it is rated for the wrong audience. It was oddly funny, and grotesquley interesting. Perhaps it was the humor, or perhaps the fact that it was one of a kind, but I thought that Yasmine Bleeth did a much better job then expected. The two male stars of the movie did quite well in their own right. Now, this movie is not as good as 'Cool Runnings'(a sports movie) or 'Austin Powers' (another goofy comedy) but it is defintley one of a kind, and a very enjoyable movie."
2,Road Kill,"I enjoyed this movie, but it is not their best work. There is a lot of down time between jokes, but that is not Trey and Matt's fault. They are excellent writers and actors. The first time I watched BASEketball, I had to rewind the ""Road Kill"" clip. I died laughing each time the announcer said, ""Road kill, caught on tape!"" and you see all the animals hitting moving vehicles. Unfortunately, that was the funniest part of the whole movie. If you're a Trey and Matt fan, go check out ORGAZMO! It is definitely the best work by the two talented guys."
5,GROSS OUT COMEDY RULES,This is one of the funniest films I've ever seen. I love it totally. The character of Skweak Scolari (LITTLE B****) is just the single most funniest little wimp ever put on screen. Every word he says and insult he receives is a thigh-slapper.
4,Excellent dumb fun!,"I'm sorry I loved this movie!!! It's rude, vulgar and dumb as ****! But, damn if I did'nt laugh my *** off! I could of lived with out seeing the guys kiss though, but that was still silly. Make sure you watch the outtakes after the credits. Lots of fun!!"
4,Witty and comical in ways no one has ever attempted!!!,"Trey Parker and Matt Stone push the limits of normal comedy beyond obsurdity and back then beyond where they were before. With great cameo appearances by that guy from ""Unsolved Mysteries"" and major stars in minor roles like Jenny McCarthy. This movies outrageous plot and fantasy with the creative genius of director David Zuckerman, will have you laughing almost all the way through. You will have to see it two, three, maybe four times to catch all of the wit and hilarity that this movie has to offer."
3,Heavy on the Gloss,"Yet another of Francois Sagan's chic, sleek, and shallow sudsers. Sagan has always examined the sins, immoralities, and weaknesses of privalged parisians, and 'La Chamade' is no exception. Basically, it's style striving for substance. Does it acheive it? No. Is that okay? Yes. 'La Chamade' is an agreeable distraction as it features a Love vs. Money storyline played out against swinging 60's Paris (with a side trip to the Mediteranian!). Catherine Deneuve looks stunning (as always) in a series of late 60s haute couture, the characters thrash about in gorgeous settings, and drive great cars. It's everything one would have watched 'Dynasty' for, however, as the film is in french the subtitles allow you to feel slightly superior and not so guilty for enjoying it!"
3,For Catherine Deneuve Devotees,"Catherine Deneuve is one of the world's most beautiful, elegant women and a talented actress. In this movie, she is the mistress of a wealthy man and has been devoted to him for years. She meets a handsome struggling young publisher and leaves her wealthy protector for him. The movie then tracks what happens to her and whether she has now found true happiness.It is a light story and probbly would not be worth watching without Catherine's presence. She dazzles on the screen and this was made at the height of her career. If you are a fan of the sixties, you will enjoy the magnificent clothes and hairstyles of the era."
2,Dub of Prince Jammy treatment,"Prince Jammy added synth bass to the ""Black Sounds of Freedom"" album and does the same to the dub versions here.As on the main album, the only outstanding track is ""I Love King Selassie"" with it's dub counterpart here titled ""Selassie in Dub"" which were both pretty big.For the rest of the songs, you'd be better off listening to the original dub versions on the album ""In Dub""."
4,A pleasant surprise!,"I bought this CD for my boss as a christmas present and he plays it in the office all the time. I didn't know what it would be like and ended up loving it. Even though there is an age difference of more than 25 years between us, my boss and I loved this CD. The music is enchantingly beautiful, uplifting and relaxing. I guess a great piece realy crosses over all generations and musical tastes. Alessi is a master with the trombone. A great buy!"
3,Lonesome Dove The Series,This series was o.k. but it was hard coming from the original movie and actors and watching the story continue. Some of the episodes were very interesting while others were very predictable.
1,Disappointing - don't expect much,"This series is poorly scripted, poorly acted, and even the historical perspectives of the Lonesome Dove series are lacking.What you will get is a western version of the 1990s, with modern characters transported to an ""old west"" set.Save your money."
3,"I didn't like it, but that doesn't mean you won't like it","""Hustlin' Pays"" by Mr. Nitro is a southern gangsta album with big bassy beats. Personally I don't like southern rap but if you enjoy southern rap then this CD is a must for you, the beats are a little slower than a normal dirty south CD which makes it unique. ""Whats up now"" & ""Hustlin pays"" are tracks that even I, a more east coast hip hop fan can enjoy. ""Boyz-in-tha-hood"" is a Dr. Dre produced track which has a nice slow Cali/Atlanta gangsta mixed beat to it. Once again if you like dirty south artists (Cash Money,No Limit,Pastor Troy etc.)pick this up."
1,talk about a crap book,this was one of the worst books i have ever readany way my 3 kids ripped it up in to pieces of they where so asamed to have that book on their book selfGotta go my kid are screamingbyehi stacey
3,Strange BUT Interesting!,"The title simply states, Strange BUT Interesting, and that rings true. Matt Riddlehoover's performance was creepy and yet very appealing. Mr. Riddlehoover is very good looking, has an outstanding body, and is perfect for the main role. The story in itself is twisted but entertaining, yet weak at the same time."
5,You Watch Out!,"There's been a lot of buzz about this actor Matt Riddlehoover (one very easy on the eye man) and this director Steve Balderson. I had to check it out for myself and watched it last night - some 4+ hours of material. The film - with and without commentary - plus over an hour of bonus video blogs. I've seen a lot of movies, but nothing quite like this. I'm still trying to absorb what I saw and heard. This is a keeper to watch again and again and well worth the price of admission. Act 1 is way-over-the-top-bizzaro-titillating comedy. I kept thinking - where is all this leading? Act 2 take an unexpectedly darker turn until the end. There's ample nudity - OK, more than ample. Someone ask Matt Riddlehoover if he did his own ""stunts"" and he said ""why, yes I did."" I'd say this film is a must see to believe, but that's just my opinion. I'll be waiting for Part 2!Sidenote: click on Steve Balderson's name."
1,Horrible,This was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Bad writing. Bad acting. Bad plot. I cannot understand any of the good reviews. Save your money and your time.
1,BORING,"The only thing that saved this boring B movie was Matt Riddlehoover's cuteness. The script was bad, the acting was bad, but Matt is oh so cute. That's all that this movie is worth is to see Matt. Should've been 'more' of him to see, though, to make up for the dumbness of the movie."
1,Worthless,"Not only is the central character in this terrible film self-absorbed and self-indulgent, so is the film itself! This silly little diddy relies far too much on narration to make its rather inane point. The script is abyssmal and the actors are mediocre. The film has the look of a slightly more polished, but certainly not more entertaining, Troma film (the makers of ""Toxic Avenger"" and other cult favorites). But it possesses none of the skill Troma is known for in telling campy stories. I wish I hadn't wasted money buying this nonsense."
3,Not what I expected,The movie kept me watching. It was full of suspense and very scary. It had a good ending and very unexpected. Had I known it was so scary I wouldn't have gotten it.
3,Yakuza by one of the masters,"I have seen two of Fukasaku's major works (the first being Battle Royale and Battles without Honor and Humanity the second) prior to this movie. And if I had watch this before one (or both) of these, I would probably gave it a higher score. But, it is a bit light compared to those two. That is not to say there isn't anything to scoff at.It has interesting camera work, biting black humor (with a dash of social commentary), and a passion for youth. It is a wonderful film for someone wanting a bit more in Yakuza films"
4,Fantastic Reliable Shifter,"I'm using this shifter on my custom shaft driven bicycle based on a frame and shaft drive system from Dynamic Bicycles. This shifter has more pull than conventional shifters to accommodate the needs of a hub gear. The shifting is solid and reliable, with a satisfying click, I've never had a single failure with it. The only thing I would warn potential buyers of is the cable routing requires a wide run straight up from the shifter, which can be rather awkward."
4,"Classy collection, classy singer","The Mexican singer has recorded a number of bolero collections, but this one is probably his finest. The choice of songs is nearly perfect, and the instrumentation manages to sound both contemporary and classic at the same time. I just wish the album were longer, it's that good."
3,The Heart is a lonely Hunter,"This book is very depressing. I kept reading it because I was sure it had to get better. Life is to short and the world is to full of great reads to spend time with this one. The message that a great life depends on ourselves and not others can be found in a lot of inspiring books. One doesn't need to get depressed to get this message. In fact, one could get so down , one could miss the message."
1,eBook problems,The kindle version of The Heart is a Lonely Hunter is full of typos and errors. If you want to get the best out of this excellent novel then rather buy the traditional paperback version. The poor quality of this edition can only damage Penguin's reputation.
4,"Classic and, thankfully, not forgotten","This wistful tale of alienation, oppression, and self-inflicted persecution, is a marvelous read. McCullers (only in her early-20s when she wrote this) poetically weaves the sights, sounds, and even the smells of the era to recreate the zeitgeist of the Jim Crow South. Kudos to Ms. Winfrey for reminding us about this wonderful story.For a modern-day twist on these familiar themes, there's another young writer you should check out: Greg Ippolito. His debut novel, ""Zero Station,"" is absolutely terrific, and an excerpt is available for FREE. He's still a relative unknown (a friend turned me onto his work)...but this is a must-read. You can check him out and read the excerpt at: www.ZERO-STATION.net. Don't miss it!"
5,One of My All Time Favorites,I'm so excited to see this book in Oprah's Book Club because its always been one of my favorites. Now so many others will get to experience the lives of these rich and earthy characters and oh and ah at the way McCullers puts ordinary words together that roll off the pages in a very extraordinary way to make this an unforgettable story. Don't pass up an opportunity to read this book; its one of those rare books that you will hardly be able to wait to go to bed with.
3,Bleak And Uninspiring,"Four lonely characters center their lives around a deaf mute, Mr. Singer, who functions amidst them like a tabula rasa onto which they project whatever they need. None of these other characters has an ability to connect in a deep and meaningful way with their peers. In seeking Singer out, they project their needs onto him, and assume he understands them in ways no one else does, while he remains virtually unknown. Meanwhile, he is deeply connected to another deaf mute, who was committed to an asylum. Singer's devotion to his friend, who in many ways is as obnoxious an individual as Ignatious T. Reilly (Confederacy of Dunces)is completely baffling.There is a horrid sense of life passing by these characters and of them being cheated by life.It was too fatalistic and depressing for my taste, without nearly as much craft as Richard Yates (Revolutionary Road)."
3,Depressing,"This story is set in the 1930's .The main character is John Singer a deaf - mute and the people around him for which he is a sounding board even though he cannot hear them.This book to me was depressing it does not have a happy ending or for that matter a happy beginning or middle. There is no action it is a character study. I understand that Miss. McCullers published this book when she was just 23 years old and for that reason I do see somewhat what all the hype is on this book because it is well written hence the 3 stars. But for me I did not enjoy this book, it depressed me and confused me. I felt the climax *no spoilers* was extremely anti-climatic. So much in this book was not explained and left me wondering and not in a good way about the reasons people did things. Over all a well written book but not one I would recommend or read again."
3,Incredibly average,"I have no idea why this book is considered a classic. It is quite pedestrian and doesn't have a real ""voice"". It's a decent portrait of some of societies ""left behind"" people, but nothing rings of literary immortality. Not memorable."
3,okay,I found the storyline too meandering with not enough substance. It was not a gripping page turner. The characters were oddballs and not terribly interesting oddballs at that. I'm very surprised this was one of Oprah's picks. It was definitely one of the more tedious choices from Oprah's list.
1,Words can not explain.....,"how BORING this book is. For the life of me I can not understand how some readers ""LOVED"" this. Like the reader from Manhattan, I also couldn't keep going after a certain page. And God knows I've tried. I've tried a couple of times. And I just couldn't go on. It just never took me anywhere. Why, for the Love of God is this book considered to be a classic?????"
1,How can I say this?.....BORING,"I am an avid reader. I will more or less read anything and everything. This, however is the most boring book I have ever read. It's been 3 weeks and I am still on page 100. I just can't get into it. And sometimes feel like I should force myself to finish it. The characters are boring. They never grow or develop. What is the point here?? Why is this book a classic?????"
1,Not only HS kids find this book boring...,"college grads find this book boring just as well. It was just so slow moving, so uninteresting, so dull and depressing. Gosh, there are so many books out there that I would consider classics. Why this book??? I can't believe readers are giving it 5 stars. I would give it NO stars if I could."
4,Defense of High Schoolers,"One critisism of this book states that it might not be ideal high school reading. I am a junior in high school. This book is a discription of loneliness and disappointment, which I believe young people understand but do not wish to accept. It is a staggering blow to idealism. Nevertheless, it is very well written and I cannot fault its honesty."
4,Interesting View of Related Lives,"This is a book which I felt was unjustly slammed by many of the high school reviewers on this web site, so I tried as much as possible to justify a 5 star rating but could not. Again, this is a book which I might not be inclined to recommend for high school reading since its description of dreams lost and disillusionment is something which may not relate well to younger readers. The prose is sometimes weak and the ending is a basic shrug towards life with the lesson of ""life goes on"". In this regard, McCullers disappoints and makes no effort to reward the reader's concern for her characters."
5,A special kind of horror: real,"This book is moving, devestating really, to those who get it, and just murdered trees to the billions who never will. If you're BORED by it don't worry . . . there's plenty of ""entertainers"" eager to keep you from learning anything about yourselves or the world by refilling your trough with mindless excitement."
3,"Not Bad, But Not Great","""The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter"" didn't move me in any way, but I can acknowledge the allure it seems to exercise on many people. Carson McCullers' prose is a bit airless for me. There is a certain beauty to be had in simple, precise language, but sometimes authors abuse that quality until their writing becomes characterless, which is how I feel about McCullers. I wasn't struck by any of her images or turns of phrase. I felt the nature of the story deserved a more poetic writing style than McCullers uses.That said, the book does have a certain impact based on the story alone. While reading it, I was only moderately involved, but the book lingered in my mind for a long time afterward, and even now I get a very distinct feeling when I think about it, which is not true of everything I read.Definitely worth reading, but not one of my personal favorites."
5,Good Characters,"At first I didn't know what to think when I finished this book. It was such a page turner and the end was like a train wreck for all of the characters. I almost felt like it was without hope. When I thought about it further, though, I reconsidered. The characters in the story don't emerge unscathed or exalted from tragic or mundane circumstances, but neither to most of us in the real world. It would have been great if Mick had been able to become a composer like she wanted, but don't most people who dream of greatness ultimately end up somewhere in between. That doesn't make life or people less valuable. The interesting characters were not at all what they appeared to be on the surface. Reading about them made the book worth reading."
3,The heart is a lonely hunter,"The book is nothing like the movie, which for once was much better than the book. The movie was outstanding."
2,I didn't understand this book!,"I'll admit that this book was interesting, but I didn't know where the author was going with it. I had to read this book for English so I could write a speech about it on whether or not it's a classic. I don't know what I will write since I really don't know what it's themes are. I could not relate to the characters very much. I don't know anyone like these people! What I saw were a bunch of losers who had their problems, but they didn't didn't try to help themselves! Mr. Singer was the most promising character in the book, but he killed himself! I was very disappointed! I guess this book made me realize that I have little problems in comparison to them. Don't read this book unless you are an expert on finding themes!"
2,The Heart is a Lonely Hunter,I find this book boring. I've had it for a month and can't bring myself to pick it up any more.
2,Depressing,"While the book is well written I have had a whale of a time getting through it. It has taken me three weeks to get past the second part. I get the premise of what she is writing about, I just find it to be terribly and overwhelmingly depressing. Tell me it gets better."
1,Slow and dull,I personally found the book slow and dull. It could not keep me interested and that is unusual since I can normally read just about any book that is put before me. There isn't much more I can really say about this book.
1,disappointing,This book was boreing to read because it did not follow a definite plot line and skipped from person to person. I didnt know what was happening or who it was happening to. It was a chore to read instead of a pleasure.
3,"A few good ideas, but went on too long","This book was overall, ""Ok"". For most of the beginning, I kept waiting and reading, thinking that it was building up to something. Welllll...it didn't. After about 150 pages, I realized that the point of the novel was just observation, and thinking. McCullers had a few good points, some interesting ideas, but they never went anywhere. It was well written, but I had to force myself to finish it, just so it would not have been a waste of money. Not a bad read if you are just looking for something, but it you want an absorbing page-turner, this is not the book for you."
1,Waste of time!,"The return for the time invested in reading this book was a big nothing - I regret picking it up. One of those books you keep hoping the author will pull together and deliver an ""ah ha"" moment - she didn't. The book simply goes no where."
4,Better then ur Average book.,The Heart is a lonely hunter is a book that is not for everybody.its not for summer reading (hint hint) but has a great deal of good work in it. I rate this book a 4 for its deep thought and good plot.
3,Pretty damn good for being 23!!,"CArson McCullers was 23 when she worte this piece of literature, and she did pretty well for being so young. I think that this work of art requires one to be in touch with the nature of others and also who appreciates the life experiences of others in relation to this outside world."
3,a moving but depressing book,"The characters are engrossing, and it was a very deep, thoughtful book. I suppose I enjoyed it, but there is a limit to how far one can enjoy a depressing book. In the beginning, you have hope for the characters; but by the end, Carson shows how futile human existence is. Mr.singer is clearly supposed to represent Jesus, and his Greek friend some version of a Buddha. I thought it was intriging how Singer, while the vessal for redemtion and emotional relief for others, never finds his own personal haven. Even Mick, the ""heroine"" of the story leaves us with a depressed and unfufilling end of things left undone. The story is well written, and well worth the read, but is so bleak that I will probably not read it again. However, it is worthwhile to read at least once. The style is spectacular! -high school sophomore"
1,"ok, but not the best.....or newhere near it","i understand where she was coming from and each of the characters problems. i'm only in eighth grade, but i know that this is real life and how people react to different things. however, the characters didn't do anything about their problems. Carson McCullers must have been dumped or something when she wrote this book because it's very depressing. the thing i don't understand is why people would want to read about real life when we already live it. we all know what life is like so what is the point of this book? it took me so long just to read a chapter. i didn't get into it at all. the book just makes you want to commit suicide or something. the only reason i read it was to get a good grade . well, at least i get $10 for getting an A in my stupid english class. u know how they say, ""never judge a book by it's cover,"" well this book is a way more boring than the cover, take my word for it."
3,required summer reading,"This was required summer reading for my teenage son. It is easy to follow the story and the language is everyday, but the story is depressing. He never would have chosen this on his own. And if I were in the library thinking about borrowing it, I probably wouldn't."
1,Read it when you're sick...,"...because then you can throw up on it, and you won't care that you have ruined the book! THIS BOOK IS HORRIBLE!"
1,"never received it, or response to e mail- or a call from amazon.","never received it, or response to e mail- or a call from amazon. bad all the way around."
2,What was Oprah thinking,What was Oprah thinking recommending this. The story is just as depressing as the picture of the author on the cover. I did not enjoy this at all.
4,Sadistic But Overwhelming,"The Heart Is A Lonely Hunter is by far her best. The book has a very depressing side to it, many people enjoy reading books that are cushy and have melodramtic endings where the 'goody' defies belief and destroys the 'baddy', but this is great 'real life', easy to relate to stuff.The way in which each character is portrayed is special, you really feel as if you know them. McCullers methods are unlike many others and among the best in the world.The book explores the spiritual side of the more or less 'rejected' beings, which is an instant put off for many. But what world do we live in? Not a perfect one. This book grapples the harshness of social decline, and never ceases to the lure of perfect people or a perfect place. The book is above all a great piece of literature by a 23 year old, which is quite an achievement.If you want a seriously good piece of literature unlike the happy ending mainstream we read all the time, this is the book for you."
1,Read Cannery Row instead,"This book is lacking some vital essence. Maybe that was the author's point. I don't go into a book with the expectation that I will bond with the characters, but I do need a reason to finish reading it. (In this case, the reason was pure, dogged cussedness on my part.) While MuCullers gives us page after page of rich detail about her characters' thoughts, lives, and surroundings, she never pulls back to let us see the big picture of why we should care. Just about anything by Steinbeck is better than this book."
4,Pretty Good Book Overall,"OK let me get the bad stuff out of the way first: the book was a little too long, all the description made it boring at times, the pacing was slow, and the characters hadn't really developed or grown by the end of the novel. But why does it get four stars, you ask? The book followed the lives of some very different people and that was interesting: a 12 year old girl, a restaurant owner, a big drunk guy, a black doctor, and two mute guys. Each chapter was about one of these people so if you got tired of reading about one, the next chapter was about someone different. There were lots of interesting parts it the book once you get past the boring, depressing description. People die, a child is shot in the head, a man gets his feet cut off. None of this stuff is good, but it makes the better more interesting to read. The book is set in 1930s Georgia and the book addresses racism and segregagtion too. Even though its long, its worth it. You'll be proud you finished the 400+ pages."
3,I thought it was......special,"I am in limbo between hating it and loving it. I am 14, in 9th grade and live far away from anything. I adore reading but it is books like this and Gulliver's Travels that make me hate it. I like action, development and a plot. All of which this book did not have. Read it if you want to but I would suggest a book with life in it."
1,Oh! So BORING,"I don't understand how readers actually like this depressing, dark, dismal book. I just couldn't finish it. I got to page 90 and couldn't go back to it. The first book ever, that I couldn't finish. I didn't want to finish it!!!! It bored me to tears. I felt nothing for the characters. I felt nothing for the plot. It's a waste of money and reading time. I just feel for all those HS kids who are required to read it for English class. Avoid it if you can!!!! And try to reason with your English teacher...."
1,"Oh my, but this is a depressing read!","I really can't see why this is considered to be a classic. The characters don't grow, they don't chance for good or bad. They never get outside themselves, and nothing ever happens. Can someone explain the point of all this to me?"
1,I hate this book!,I thought it was very boring. We had to read this for our english class and our teacher kept saying how great this book was but i didnt like it at all. I thought it was the worst book i ever read. It doesnt deserve any stars
2,Ughhh,"The language in this book was wonderful. The writer does have a way with words and imagery. The ending was unsuspected. BUT, not an easy read. It was difficult to finish the book. It felt flat."
5,Oprah knows,"Oprah is a pretty good judge of character when it comes to books. I remember she recommended my favorite book, The Little Guide To Happiness. From then on I listened to her in regards to books. This one is great."
2,Overrated and Awful,"A truly overrated and awful book. Full of over-the-top imagery, cartoon characters, hoary motivations, semi-socialist polemics (truthfully it is so muddled it is difficult to find the point) and adolescent heavy breathing on the subjects of sex and fidelity and loyalty. It would be funny if it wasn't so earnest.Hemingway summed it up best by calling the book, ""phony."""
1,Not Worth It,"The book asks many questions, answers few and just refuses to reach any kind of conclusion on anything.It's standing at #17 in the Modern Library Top 100 borders on the absurd"
1,Make sure you read some of the reviews before you read,"Please take the time to consider what kind of reader you are. I hated this book. It took me at least 6 months to read this because I could not force myself to read it. But that being said I also hate stream of consciousness and now wished that I had looked at some reviews and realized that was what I was getting myself into. I read 'As I Lay Dying' in High School and hated it too. There is no plot, and no point. I hated it."
1,Did it really take all these pages to detail......nothing?!?!?!?,"Oprah's book club has lost a lot of its credibility with this book.This book just seemed to go on and on and on without anything really happening.It babbled on for something like 360 pages to document the following things: A quasi-homosexual relationship between two mutes; A revolutionary drunk; A snotty, pretentious doctor who babbled on about Karl Marx (*yawn*-- how long is it going to be before people let him go?); A white trash girl who loved music.Save your money (and your time)."
1,"I really, really tried...","This is the most boring book I have ever read. I kept hoping something would happen and nothing ever did. I only cared about two of the characters out of about 5 featured and I was shocked to find that nothing ever really brought them together. I wasn't expecting a John Grisham thriller here, but I did expect to at least enjoy reading the book or even have something to think about after I was finished. By the time the last 20 pages came, I found myself just skimming to get to the end so that I could say I finished it and that my opinion was valid. All I thought about was how many hours I wasted reading it. Sorry, but it was that bad!!!"
1,Hard to get into,"This book was very hard to get into. I didn't like the way the story jumped from one character to another. It was like the author's mind was all over the place when she wrote it. I really didn't understand the point in the story.It took me forever to finish this book,I just had a hard time picking it up again.I eventually did finish it, but was very disappointed in it."
3,I thought the book was insightful and also depressing.,"I read this book because it was voted in the top 100 of all time. I'm trying to expand on the kind of popular fiction I usually read. While I found the book insightful and well-written, it was very depressing. I kept waiting for something ""good"" to happen to somebody. I did think the book's various plots were remarkable for its time (1940)."
3,Regarding the Audio Version,"The story is tightly written and very insightful. The characters are well developed. If I were rating the book, I would give it five stars. However, I chose the audio edition, which does not do justice to the book. The reader makes all of the characters sound drunk. Her Southern and Black accents are terrible. Her voice is so shrill and jarring that I have to continually readjust the volume. If you can't manage the book version, skip it altogether."
5,Emotional Narrative,"This book was amazing in conveying the emotions of despair and loneliness. The message sent by the novel is that there is no true answer to our problems - we may think we almost have it, and then everything can be quickly shattered. What I found most interesting about the novel was the fact that Blount (the drunk), would always say, ""we need for the people to KNOW, and once they KNOW, then the lie can be exposed."" It is this knowledge that McCullers nourishes the reader with. A deeply moving story with an important message."
3,"5 star writing style, but the story is nothing to write home about","I bought this paperback to occupy me when I was knocked off my feet, and was glad to find it so entertaining. I was very impressed with McCullers' keen observation of people and found myself laughing out loud more than once. Reading something written in the thirties and noticing what has changed and what hasn't was interesting. However, I mistakenly waited to find out ""the point"" to it all. When I reached the end of the book, I found there was no point. I don't believe, as some do, that this book is about communism (though one of the characters is certainly all about communism.) McCullers is an extremely talented writer, but be prepared to read to the end and think, ""That's it?"" (Or just stop reading at any convenient point prior to the ending.)On a side note, if you are looking for a feel-good book or a happy ending, keep looking."
2,Not the ending i expected,"I decieded to read this book and join in on the hype. This book is not what i had expected. The writing is great and the character detail is great, but i must have missed something. The book bored me and the end...man, it left me with no deeper look at life."
2,not one of Oprah's best picks...,I found the storyline too meandering with not enough substance. It was not a gripping page turner. The characters were oddballs and not terribly interesting oddballs at that. I'm very surprised this was one of Oprah's picks. It was definitely one of the more tedious choices from Oprah's list.
1,Waste of time,"""The Heart is a Lonely Hunter"" is simply a compilation of character sketches loosely strung together. If you are a student of literary characterization and the methods authors use to bring a character to life, you might enjoy this book. The charcters are indeed animated. However, if you are searching for a book that combines vivid characters with any sort of plot, this book is not for you. By the time I was half-way through the book I was seriously wondering when a coherant plot would develop. One never materialized. This book does not adhere to the standard beginning-middle-end, protagonist-antagonist-plot-resolution formula by which most novels abide.As I was reading this book as a book club assignment, I trudged through to its completion. Now all I wish is that I could recapture the hours of life wasted on its pages."
1,The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter,"Maybe it's just me, but I thought this book was boring. It introduces several characters plodding along in life, but fails to present a good solid story line for any of them. They basically do nothing with their lives."
2,feeble,"Well, we have a new contender for worst choice for the Modern Library Top 100 of the Century. This dismal book is the story of a flock of Southern losers and misfits in the 1930's. The characters lead uniformly desperate and joyless lives, depicted in a story unleavened by humor.It's the sort of book that contributes to the caricature of Southern authors as suicidal drunks.GRADE: D"
3,"Challenging maybe, but a fine work nonetheless","I usually don't post reviews, but I felt compelled to speak up about this particular work. Given all the negative reviews - some of which characterizing this as the ""work book ever"" - you may be tempted to pass this one by. Don't.Literary masterpiece? I don't know about that, as few works really live up to that title. And this book *is* challenging to read, and it *is* depressing. But those two criteria are not an argument for not reading a book.I found this book, above all else, to be very real and very moving. The style is at times opressive, but also at times a bit charming. I've not read anything else quite like it, and I'm very glad that I spent the time on it.You may be too, and at the very least, this is one book worth making your own judgement about."
1,This book was such a drag,"What a waste of time. I seriously cannot figure out how this book was an Oprah book club pick. The characters where unlikeable to me. I didn't relate or sympathize with one of them. I didn't feel that there was a true story with a conclusion or point of any kind. It was down right strange. I forced myself to read it because it was a selection for my book club. I would not recommend it to anyone. If you want a good book w/ likeable characters and a moral message, read to Kill A Mockingbird. Now that's a classic."
2,Not a book I'd recommend,"This book was required reading in my honors english class. When I first recieved a copy I thought it looked interesting and different. In the beginning I wasn't really drawn into the book, like so many other's I've read. I read on, thinking it would get better. I was wrong. In fact it just got worse. I couldn't relate to the characters. I mean a girl who hears music in her head, a man exploring his femine side, a Deaf-mute, and a man who is half the time drunk and the other half trying to start a revolution. It did have some good parts but not enough to make it worth the read."
1,I agree - its BORING,"I wish I would have read these reviews before I picked up the book at the local booksellers. I kept waiting for something good to happen, but alas... it never got to the level I expected. :("
2,Unremitting Bleakness of Life,"I coudn't stop thinking while I was reading this, I couldn't stand more than a hundred pages, that it was a brilliant work for a very sensitive,depressed, lonely, highly intelligenttwenty something writer. Who wasn't made like other folks, and for many artists that's a necessary evil. I havent' read anything else by her, and I don't think I will, I have a feeling life doesn't get better in the works of Carson McCuller and that's too bad.The writing is much better than OK, but,this work is amateurish in structure. There is no impelling story of any kind, just a wearing down, gets to be boring, pastiche of miserable and semi-miserable characters going nowhere except into a future of deepening misery and despair.Yes there are pleanty of folks like that but nothing redeems them here.McCullers is a southern grotesque who lacks the vitality of Flannery O'Connor and the enduring humanity and brilliance of William Faulkner."
5,Good Pick Oprah!,"Well until recently I haven't felt much like reading, then one day I picked up this novel and I couldn't put it down. I saw teh reading sceduale for people who were reading it along with the Oprah book club and discovered I was way ahead. This is by far one of the best books I have ever read. I wonder what Oprah has instore for the next selection. She knows good books."
5,Excellent Work,"To have written such a novel at such a young age amazes me - such insight, though universal, is learned by experience when youth wanes and the rose-colored glasses inevitably have to come off.The story touches a chord in anyone willing to admit the loneliness felt at certain times in life. Not so much the reality of living but what each of us perceives to be reality and the unfortunate shattering of that perceived reality and how we handle it.There is hope and it is found in faith in the true God. McCullers's was quoted as saying she wrote to find God. Her searching is quite evident in this work but where one looks and with what eyes one looks with has everything to do with finding Him."
2,This Book has so little,"excitement that I felt like a zombie reading it. I struggled mercifully to finish it, and when I did I wasn't at all satisfied. The book is incredibly boring, and is NO CLASSIC! I think that this book has its moments but other than that it is horrible. I was forced to read this by my English teacher. How cruel!!!"
1,Putting it down?,"""When one puts [this book] down, it is with . . . a feeling of having been nourished by the truth."" When I put this book down, I just kept asking myself what made me pick it up to begin with."
5,hard to put down,"I love this book and would recommend it to anyone that loves a great book. It was so identifiable.....Some of the characters remind me of myself....I was able to see a bit of Mick, Portia, and Blount in myself....The parts that really got to me were when Blount heard two coworkers talking about him and when Mick was always tired after working."
1,Just because a book is depressing doesn't make it profound,"This may have been the worst book I ever read. The plot went nowhere, the characters were flat, and the style was childish. Deserves 0 stars"
3,Going back to Freshman English class . . .,"What struck me the most about this book was how much the writing reminded me of Steinbeck or Hemmingway. If you like that writing and story telling, you will probably like this book. I never did understand why they were such acclaimed writers. There is something about this book - like it's trying to tell you something, but you just don't know what. Trying to be clever, but maybe too clever for me. The writing is very plain, but not direct. Am I too shallow or simple that I would like a plot?I know a lot of the acclaim over this book is that a white writer could so accurately portray the thoughts of black people. This was amazing because of the time that this book was written. But, a classic should be timeless. We should be able to be impressed by the book regardless of when it was written.In my opinion, this book doesn't hold up to that standard."
2,Overrated,"Overrated. Just god awful, can't stand it. Ok, I know that isn't really helpful, but I have a feeling that this is one of those books that everyone claims to enjoy becuase they don't want to be accused of ""not getting it."" The characters were really difficult to care about, and the writing was just blah. Truly overrated (like most Oprah books)."
3,It is a slow book but it has a unique style of writing.,"I read ""The Heart is a Lonely Hunter"" as a class assignment. At first I didn't like the book at all because it is relatively slow. Then, at the end, the whole book comes together. This ending made me sit back and think about the book and how each event leads to the conclusion. The book is slow but it has great detail. Another good quality that the book offers is its unique style of writing. I have never read a book like this one by Carson McCullers. Although I enjoyed the style of the book, overall I didn't like it. Not that it wasn't a good book, it just didn't suit my tastes. I like fast books, the ones which you cannot put down. This is the only reason that kept me from enjoying ""The Heart is a Lonlely Hunter"" to its fullest."
4,Cherry Jones +++,"The thing about audio books is the reader, who can make or break the aural experience. Cherry Jones makes what would otherwise be a dated novel come alive. Her ability to portray multiple characters of both genders is astonishing."
2,This was very basic!!! Requiring much unnecessary work!,"This book covers the gist of the subject matter and in a conservative way, yet asks the reader to do far more than is really necessary, so I would recommend one that covers so much more. The book I recommend educated and moved meYOUR GUIDE FOR DEFENDING THE BIBLE Self-Education of the Bible Made EasyYOUR GUIDE FOR DEFENDING THE BIBLE HAS IT ALL:* A Preface and Introduction* A section on Biblical Hermeneutics, with 11 chapters* A section on Inductive Bible Study, with 7 chapters* A section on a Book Study Program, with 4 chapters* A Section on Bible Difficulties, with 6 chapters* A section on Basics of Textual Criticism, with 4 chapters* A section on Basics of Bible Translation, with 4 chapters* A Section on Understanding Our Imperfections, with 6 chapters"
5,How to Study Your Bible,"This is an excellent book. Very helpful if you are unsure how to study a your Bible or if you have been haphazard in doing so. It has made and will continue to make my time alone with God more inclusive, unforgettable, and even more precious to me. Thank you, Kay Arthur for making this available to us.Nada Davis"
4,How to Study Your Bible,"This is a great book for people who want to learn practical skills to enhance their understanding of the Bible. It teaches how to study, interpret and most importantly make correct applications of Biblical principles in our day to day lives."
1,waste of money and time,"If you have nothing else to do 24/7,you can read this.Too much unnecessary work.Surely there is an easier way to study the Bible!"
3,"Don't but these, buy the 2500mAh instead","These work just fine. However, they are made in China. The 2500mAh version is made in Japan. I own both 2100 & 2500 and by far the 2500mAh is better, not just because it has a higher current rating."
2,They really don't hold a charge very well,"I have a lot of different NiMH batteries. Some from major battery companies, others from the off brands. Some are five years old. These are maybe six months old. These loose their charge (resting discharge) faster than any of the other batteries that I have. They are almost unusable because of this. If I take them from the charger they are good for a couple of hours of use in my Powershot camera. If I wait two weeks, the camera says change batteries immediately. I have done the discharge/recharge cycle, but it hasn't helped.As an alternative, I have recently gotten several of the ready to use (R2U) slow discharge NiMH. These seem to be much better than all of the rest of my NiMH batteries."
5,Love!,"I used to not be able to wear rings because I was allergic to the nickle but I found sterling silver to be just fine. Me, being the person that never really enjoyed jewelry very much. This ring is so much better when looking at it on your finger than online!! Although it's very pretty online It's not to big and it's modern! The blue is absolutely georgous and the design is great. I love it so very much, I don't think I'll ever take it off."
2,CD is scratched,Most of the CD plays well but there are some scratches on it. I am kind of disappointed as this is the first used cd that i have bought that has scratches.
5,"2% Jazz, 98% Funky Stuff.","There is too much funk in this small disc. ""Shake Everything You've Got"" starts out the live album properly, 16 minutes of pure funk you won't ever want to end. Sadly it does end, but luckily when it does you hear ""Pass the Peas."" These two songs alone are well worth the price of the whole disc. Next is I got You (I feel Good). The priceless James Bown classic is alive with Kim Mazelle on vocals. Mazelle sticks around for Got to Get U, a Maceo classic originally released on ""All the King's Men."" Then, the disc slows down a bit but still stays funky. Another James Brown classis, ""Soul Power"" finishes off the album. The JB horns are so tight on this album it is almost disgusting. If you enjoy yourself a good funk every once in a while, you should probably pick up this disc. If you enjoy yourself a good funk a lot, you probably have this. If you don't, click ""Buy Now"" Immediately."
5,Maceo is king as the funkdafied jazzman,"Live On Planet Groove posesses jazz reminiscent of Maceo's earlier work, yet with a newfound funk element... It's truly dope."
2,"Maceo good, album bad.","The things I dislike about this album have actually already been mentioned: many of the songs go on way too long (they're the big long concert versions), and the editing is really bad. Respectively, this means that the album has all the disadvantages of a live album and none of the atmosphere or excitement. If you're a big Maceo fan, go ahead and get this - I really liked tracks 5&6, and his playing is great. If you're not, look for the dozens of other records which he appears on."
4,Some stellar high points but inconsistant ....,"I like this album even though it does suffer some inconsistancies. I love Maceo's playing bu my main complaint is with the editing and mixing job on this album. It is a live album and some of the songs go on and on especially with Pass the Peas. If you're a die hard Maceo fan and like either James Brown and/or Tower of Power, you'll also like this album."
2,Ok,"These water bottles definitely have the right price, but that's about where the good things end.The mounting accessory provided... I have no idea what I was supposed to do with it - and it came with no instructions. I couldn't get it to fit on any of the three bikes I bought one for, and eventually just zip-tied the holder onto the bikes instead. Which worked fine, until I realized that these bottles must be leaking something into the water. Leave the water in the bike for a few hours, and it's tastes TERRIBLE, almost tastes like sewer water. It's awful.So, while the price is certainly right, not much else about these bottles is."
3,Looks good...,"I bought two water bottles w/ cages. They look good. However, I ordered blue and was sent black. Otherwise...they should do their job."
2,Good concept - Bad Execution,"This kid acoustic guitar looks really nice, but when it comes to using it, we had to DUCT TAPE the tuner knobs in order to keep the strings in place. And we had to use A LOT OF DUCT TAPE. The guitar is of no use if the strings won't stay in place and without duct tape, we couldn't get one string to play.Now that it is all duct taped, my 3 year old does enjoy it, but the toy shouldn't have to be duct taped in order to work properly."
1,product had a problem,The strings wouldn't tighten. Not sure if it's worth paying more shipping to return it.
1,"Bogus Austin Bazaar 25"" Acoustic Toy guitar","This guitar looks good in the picture but in reality is poorly made. When my Grandson, Jake, opened his birthday gift (he turned 4 on Jan. 3, 2009), his eyes lit up. It held together less than 1 hour. Jake is terribly disappointed. You know the routine: If Grandmom's not happy, ain't nobody happy. The bridge fell off almost immediately and all the strings are hanging. The strap fell off and won't stay on. I strongly suggest you remove this toy from your catalog. Today is Jan 7, 2009. I want my money back."
2,Product is misrepresented,This item is misrepresented in the description. It comes with a strap that cannot be attached without buying and installing an end pin and it says it comes with a pitch pipe which was not included. The product details are misleading and although the price is good you do not get what you think you are paying for.
3,"nice looking, but don't expect much","We purchased this guitar as a Christmas present for our young son, since he sees daddy playing guitar quite a bit. It is a very stylish looking guitar with nice accessories, but don't expect to be able to tune it to sound anything like an actual guitar. It is best for pretend play more than anything."
3,"""Toy"" Guitar","We bought this guitar and aren't very pleased. It comes with a strap but there is no where to attach it, which defeats the purpose of having the strap included. The wood on the front of the guitar will damaged easily, so you have to be careful not to drop or step on it. I do like the fact that it comes with a bag for storing the guitar and accessories."
4,Jakob touches Bob,"This is not as consistent an album as Bringing Down The Horse. In fact, some of the moments drag. Yet, this is a more important album for Jakob Dylan. ""Hand Me Down"" and ""Birdcage"" are superb songs but the masterpiece is ""I've Been Delivered"". I think it could rank up right up there with the best his father ever did (and I'm a huge fan). It's not mentioned anywhere, maybe I'm imagining it, but the song seems to me to be the thoughts of a man dying and the life he just lived, flashing in front of him. Hear it like this - the beauty of the rambling journey he presents is so utterly palpable. So, tell me, someone, am I imagining it, or is that what it is?"
4,This is where they're reaching the pinnacle,"I liked the Wallflowers from the beginning, but ""Breach"" is where you start to see the lyrics become personal. Jakob Dylan's reached down deep and come up with some winners. ""Murder 101"", and ""Some Flowers Bloom Dead"" are two favorites--right now. I cannot consistently say there's just one song on any Wallflowers CD. Their music is consistently good and interesting even when it's not the most recent."
3,"Great album, but nothing new","This is a great album, no doubt, but it explores places that weve been through before with this band and others. I expected more after such a long time off. This is a musically rich album that causes one to think of their previous work and the work of Petty and somber Boss, but I wish they couldve stretched a little further in their exploration. All is being said about Dylan's ""coming out of his shell"" and thats great, but this is familiar material. Fewer hooks than Horse, though still memorable and catchy. This is a band destined for great things, especially in today's age of crap music, but they havent hit that point yet of full potential. I believe it will come soon, just as long as its not another four years."
4,Great,"This CD is quite good but, not as good as bringing down the horse mind you but good none the less. It is a solid purchase for the bigger fans. But if you are just looking for some good music I still recomend getting bringing down the horse."
4,Between Bob and Tom,"Jakob is clearly son of Bob. Not that his music is very similar to his father's one but his voice in some moments sounds like the one of Bob. However, more often Jakob Dylan (and his band too) sounds like Tom Petty and his Heartbreakers. Especially in songs Hand Me Down and Witness it is very evident.It is very well balanced album. Good songs and lyrics, well played and a good sound. But I do not think it is as good as their debut Bringing Down the Horse."
4,The Wallflowers do it again...,"I got this CD for my birthday and it's the only CD I listen to as much as my Matchbox Twenty CDs. If you know me, this is a major thing! Tracks like ""Hand Me Down"" and ""Letters From the Wasteland are pure gold. Also, songs like ""Witness"" and ""Babybird"" (hidden track) are great too. Jakob's vocals are stunning. A must for any Matchbox Twenty/Everclear/Goo Goo Dolls/ fan like me!"
3,Sadly Apathetic,"Since the Wallflowers are such an awesome band, maybe I was expecting too much from Breah, but it's really not that good of a CD. The Wallflowers' previous album BRINGING DOWN THE HORSE left me stunned, and had awesome, real, lyrics. Breach seems to be a stark contrast. The lyrics have an apathetic, ""looking-down-on-you"" attitude which I'm not too fond of. Although I appreciate the quality of the folk-rock style music, the lyrics make me feel cold inside, they feel so hollow. I'd prefer much more wholesome BRINGING DOWN THE HORSE much more than this."
4,An excellent follow-up to 'Bringing Down the Horse',"The first time I listened to 'Breach,' I was actually pretty disappointed...the songs seemed slow and dull, and instantly forgettable compared to those on the last Wallflowers release, 'Bringing Down the Horse.' After a few more listens, though, more of the songs came alive, and the hooks and lyrics became much more memorable. Most of the album, in fact, is excellent, lyrically stronger than previous Wallflower songs. There may not be as many radio-friendly songs on 'Breach,' but there are more truly exellent songs."
2,A Tom Petty&The Heartbreakers Clone????,JakobDYlan&Crew Sound like they have been Listening non-stop to TOm Petty&The Heartbreakers.if the Profile of this Group wasn't so High&By The way carrying The Dylan Last Name wasn't being always Mentioned they Might get away with this Album.However it really doesn't add much to the last one.it's Basic&Comfortable in it's Element.Tom Petty has had some Moments but He's No Bob Dylan.why would you Settle for 2nd's when you should Strive to be Better than That?Maybe The Next Record will Bring better Results.
2,Not their best stuff,"Given that the band took a 4-year hiatus since their last work, they certainly could have done better than this. although the first single, Sleepwalker, is catchy, the CD is punchless beyond it. Gone are the rhythms that made songs such as One Headlight, The Difference, Heroes, etc. into radio hits. I expect sales to drop like a stone once people realize the CD has only one hit on it."
2,Not Very Good,"Well, I waited for this album for quite a few years and I must admit I feel let down. ""Bringing Down the Horse"" was so utterly perfect and wonderful and I expected this album to be just as good. However, the songwriting is so bad on this album that I felt the money I had spent to purchase it had been wasted. I mean, what the heck was up with ""Murder 101""? It sounds like garage music written by a 12-year-old. I gave the album 2 stars because at least the performance style is polished and the vocals are pretty good."
1,umm...i dont know what yall are smokin.,"no song on this album is worthy of airplay. nothing catchy, and really its quite boring. some people do like the slower folky stuff and this stuff is just that.some of the lyrics are really just cliches."
2,Whassupppppp,"I really do not understand these reviews. How can this record be considered stellar? HA! What a joke. The production is way too polished, the songs are simply dull. The hidden track is really the only decent track on the cd. I guess they are just trying to make some spending money (i would imagine it will sell millions...probably even win a grammy!) and sacrifice the creativity. I heard their first album and thought it was great....the second one was better.....and now this! C'mon guys! Jacob needs a little tutoring from his pop. This record, coming from a band with potential, simply sucks."
5,Wonderful...,"I bought this CD back in October immediately after it came out. I hadn't listened to the Wallflowers for a while because I felt that they had been played out, and then they disappeared. How glad I am that they released this new album. It is absolutely beautiful and better than most music that has come out in recent years. This album is timeless and will outlast the current trends of bubblegum pop and rock... . Thank you so much for giving me faith in the current music scene!"
5,kingsummers is blown away,"**Breach** is simply incredible. The CD has hits from beginning to end and it stays true to the Wallflowers sound. This is definitely a must have, it's impossible to take it out of your cd player. i just saw them in concert 12.09.00 and they sounded unbelievable. Hurry and grab this cd,it's destined to be a classic, once again Jakob opens his heart and soul to the listener and absolutely blows you away. The boys are back after a long 4 years. don't wait any longer, your really missing out."
4,a little bit deeper,"This album of the wallflowers is different from their first in that Jakob's lyrics have gotten a little bit deeper and more introspective. The more folk rock feel of the album is perfect to just listen to. All in all another gem for the wallflowers, and we hope to see more soon."
3,good follow up,"I wore out the previous Wallflowers album and was eagerly anticipating this new one. There are some solid songs on this one: Sleepwalker, Letters from the Wasteland, Hand Me Down, but no real great ones like One Headlight, Sixth Avenue, or God Don't Make Lonely Girls. I recommend this album for Wallflower fans, for newcomers I would start with the previous album, ""Bringing Down the Horses"". Overall a solid three stars."
3,No sophomore slump,"This is a really good CD. Bringing Down the Horse was pretty much an impossible act to follow, but this was a good effort in that direction. I miss T-Bone Burnett's production touch on this one, but I have the feeling that the more I listen to it, the more it's going to grow on me. The bonus CD is nice, but not really that big a deal.Highlights for me are ""Hand Me Down"", ""Some Flowers Bloom Dead"", and ""Letters From the Wasteland"".If you come in with realistic expectations, you'll enjoy this CD. If ...Horse set you up expecting the moon, you'll be disappointed."
4,worth the wait,"Much like many of the Wallflowers fans, I have waited four long years for this cd and it was well worth it. The songs on Breach may not strike the listener as immediate radio-friendly hits, but the catchy chords and soulful lyrics will definitely resonate in the head hours after the music has stopped. Breach illustrates the maturing of the Wallflowers, and they seem to have found a comfortable place to stand among today's rock artists. The cd may be a bit more mellow than Bringing Down The Horse (and shorter-only 10 songs plus a bonus track), but I think that it is a better all-around effort that will remind listeners of what it takes to be a truly great band. This cd is definitely worth getting and I highly recommend it."
4,not bad,"its a shame this album isnt doing too well and it probably will be considered a perfect example of a sophomore slump. sleep walker went nowhere, and the album has dropped off the top 100 in about only 7 weeks. this album does have some strong points. a main issue from the wallflowers is to create something thats not bland. on some of their cd's they fail to make anything different and it all sounds the same. with this one, they have some variety, but its alot like the other one. just great pop/rock music. i dont see a bright future for them, and thats a shame. the wallflowers are a great band, and you should probably check this album out."
4,SOLID WORK...NICELY DONE,"No...this is not Bringing Down the Horse...this is Breach. It is doubtful you will hear Sleepwalker (first single released off Breach) on the radio every 30 minutes for the next six months, largely due to the fact that it isn't nearly the best song on the album (see Hand Me Down, Up From Under and Mourning Train). I'm sure The Wallflowers could have sold out and rattled off a new album immediately after the success of their second album, but they chose to take their time and put out a quality product instead. Imagine that! This is a great album...not to be compared to Bringing Down the Horse...but a great album in it's own right. Buy it...NOW!!!"
5,Thank God for Rock and Roll!,"The Wallflowers are one of the last great, tried-and-true rock bands. Breach is a great cd with heartfelt lyrics and melodies that catch you from the intros. Putting Jakob Dylan up to his father's standards is absurd. Every songwriter is different in their own way, and no one could duplicate what Bob Dylan has done for music. Jakob's lyrics are every bit as good as his father's, and I say that from listening to both of them extensively. I'm a big Bob Dylan fan and a big Wallflowers fan, but I think this industry sucks for blackballing them just because Jakob doesn't meet their ""expectations"". The Wallflowers have come a long way, and they've scored a big hit with me when the released Breach. Good luck in everything, guys!"
4,Breach - Mellow but Good Rock Album,"This is a really great album with a lot of great instrumentation, insightful lyrics and Jakob Dylan's voice which is as always , awesome, that is really mellow. It reminds me a lot of a cross between Wildflowers-era Tom Petty and Nebraska-era Bruce Springsteen with choruses you can sing along to. It's clearly already one of the best albums of the year. I really enjoy the album but my only gripe is that while its a great album I was hoping for an album that rocked a little harder (like murder 101 which is a great ROCK song)."
1,Bathroom Tapes - Drone On,These songs are awful. The muscianship is awful. The singing is awful. No one other than the son of a rock and roll icon could possibly get this through a record company. The young Dylan sounds worse than sad voiced Bob Dylan on a really bad day. I mean a really bad day. And why is he trying to sound like his father anyway.Singing this awful should only be done in the bathroom with the shower on full blast or maybe out in a forest where no one can hear. I had to rate this on a scale of 1 to 5 stars so I gave it one star. Believe me it should have no stars. Drone on.
4,It's LOUD,"I've read that this was a loud little fan. I wanted it to quietly circulate the heat from the fireplace around the family roon and away from the underside of he mantle. So I figure; it's small, how loud can it be? Well I just received it and it is LOUD for such a small fan, even on it's lowest setting, but it does move quite a bit of air for such a small fan. If, like many people you want to use it for 'white noise' during those hot summer nights with the windows open, this is the fan for you. If you want quiet go fo the Lasko 3525 (I also have one of them) but it's only two speed, doesn't move nearly the same amount of air, and it's more expensive."
3,Different,"Well I will try to keep this short. This album is pretty god but PJ has lost something. The songs lack emotion. They dont get inside of you. I thought the first three albums were by far the best. No Code(their worst effort) and Yield werent as good but had some decent songs...songs where yu just think wow and replay it over and over. This album lacks that, maybe it will grow on me. Its very mellow and not what you are probaly expecting or hoping for......."
1,Anyone want to buy a used Binaural CD?,"Go ahead. Write me off as a casual, post-Ten Pearl Jam fan if it makes you feel better. Assume that I know nothing about the history of the band, or what their stance is in the music scene, or have heard none of their B sides. The fact of the matter is, this CD is pathetic. It has the sound of a weak garage recording, where Eddie's vocals are often drowned out by play that is about as tight as cheesecloth. The beauty and draw of this band has always been Eddie's vocals, which are virtually background noise here. If this is a sign of things to come for the band, then I guess I'll stick with the old stuff, and try and forget they ever made an album after Live on 2 legs. Maybe I'm just not ""in"" enough to ""understand"" what the band is doing, but I think its a lame excuse by people clinging desparately to what they want to hear. If it were any other band, it wouldn't have sold 200 copies."
2,Songs that Go Nowhere,"I don't normally write reviews, but I feel giving this album 4 stars is completely out of step. I am simply writing this review to possibly balance the diehards. I am a big Pearl Jam fan, and I really enjoyed Yield. I just didn't feel like there was any direction or drive whatsoever on this album. The songs will build to what is hopefully a dramatic plain, but just don't seem to reach their ultimate destination. Maybe I'm rating this too low, but I expect much, much more out of a Pearl Jam album. It almost seems as if the band recorded this album with other thoughts on their minds, and missed the mark with the music. I see the potential in many of the songs, but that is what is most disappointing about Binaural. It seems as if they had just spent more time preparing themselves for this record, they would have undoubtedly produced a gem, like most of their previous work."
4,Krista's Review,"Well, this c.d grows on me. It's newer so they kinda went with the times of music, still incorporating their own classic style with it. That's why its so cool. My favs on this C.D is Insignificance, Grievance, Rival and Nothings as it seems. I suggest yuou listen to some songs on the live Pearl Jam c.ds first because they are better than the studio versions on this C.D"
4,"Awesome, but only for big Pearl Jam fans.....","I love this CD, it has alot of musical and lyrical depth and is another step in Pearl Jam's much talked about evolution. I am also a drummer and Matt Cameron (previously of Soundgarden) is my favorite drummer. This is the first PJ album with him on it, and the weird time signatures and drum parts in some of these are cool. It's a great cd, but it does get old after time if you are not willing to appreciate the musicianship that went into it. It's more just interesting to listen to that it is fun to listen to. If you are a Pearl Jam fan, buy it and you will love it, but if you aren't you will probably find the cd boring. If you just want to hear what Pearl Jam is like, or have 1 or 2 PJ cds in your collection, go out and buy their first and most famous, and probably best album, Ten."
4,Binaural by Pearl Jam,"Pearl Jam's every new album is something to explore. This album is something different from their previous works yet strong and powerful.Best tracks: Breakerfall, Slight Of Hand, Light Years, Soon Forget."
4,Just short of greatness,"I have read alot of negative reviews for this LP of late and would just like to say that if you are a true fan of the band you will enjoy it.The biggest knock on Binaural seems to be that it is too slow and that there are not enough potential hit singles. While yes there are more slower moodier songs on this disk, rockers such as Evacuation, Greivence and God's dice are all classic Pearl Jam. While the more mid tempo Thin Air, and Light years(my current favorite) should be enough for those looking for another Betterman or Daughter. Overall I would say that this is the least experimantal Pearl Jam recording since Vs, with only the Ukelele ballad Soon forget, straying from the Pearl Jam norm. So don't let the reviews get you down, if you are a Pearl Jam fan, who have enjoyed their previous efforts, go pick Binaural up. You won't be disappointed."
2,"I Know, I Know...","I'm probably going to have one of those 0 out of 345 people found this review helpful, but something went wrong. I LOVE ten as well as I love Vs. and Yield, but this is not a strong effort. I gave it two stars because I believe there are two VERY GOOD songs on it ""Nothihg as it seems"" and the best song ""Sleight of Hand"". I see many people reviewing it saying it was so great, but really, if this wasnt PJ they would rank it very low. I could care less about the whole ""grunge is dead"" and ""go back music like ten"", the lyrics would have been good if it were spoken word but w/the music behind it, it doesnt sound right, not to mention the lack of overall rocking that makes PJ a great band. I LOVED Tiny Music.. by STP(witch was not rocking either) and some people hated it, maybe its a aquired taste, but its not for me"
1,A Compilation of Disjointed Noise,"This CD is without a doubt the worst Pearl Jam effort I have ever heard. I've read reviews that advise listening to it several times before you judge it however, once was honestly all I could handle. For those of us who have been listening to Pearl Jam over the years, they have often included the occasional out of tune, slightly off key track in some of their albums but this sounds as if disharmony and for lack of a better word ""weird"" ho-hum effects were the goal. Get back to basics Eddie........Ask youself this, ""When was the last time I heard anything from this album played on ANY radio station?"""
