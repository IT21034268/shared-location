2,Too complex to figure out,"We purchased this game because we love Settlers of Catan and Carcassonne, thinking this will be another great board game to enjoy. Unfortunately, we were unable to understand the instructions enough to ever play it, even though we are intelligent, well educated people. We have never had a problem learning a game before this. I ended up selling it on ebay at a loss. It would have helped us if we had a friend who has played it before, and who could explain it to us. I am sure it is a great game once you know how to play, but that is where the problem lies."
5,Puerto Rico is Awesome,"This is a great resource allocation & strategy game. It's a pleasure to play, but you do have to 'invest' some time to learn the game. There are a lot of rules, which seem arbitrary at first, but you realize the genius of the rules later.Game play can take 2-4 hours, so it's a longer game."
5,Great Game,"We entered the world of ""Eurogames"" years ago with Settlers of Catan and have been branching out! Puerto Rico is a great game--easy to learn, enjoyable gameplay, excellent replay value."
4,Puerto Rico Game,The game was complex in a good way. There is one warning that the brown disks clearly represent the slaves. That is the way Puerto Rico is a very real situation that built that nation with good and bad.
3,Makes me a pyromaniac for an evening or two,"""Streets on Fire"" was a fun read with localized flavor and strong characterization. It was probably oversold as linked to ""motorcycle"" books due to its ""motorcycle gang"" angle with the backdrop of the Compton, L.A. riots, but I'm glad I read it and would buy another of Shannon's books.....with about a 6 month hiatus ..... Like many fun reads, certain cowboy or detective books come to mind, they are always more enjoyable when interspersed with other, totally different, books....with my memory, I can then ""rediscover"" Shannon as a writer, if not ""Streets on Fire"" again, and while away another enjoyable evening or two."
5,My new favorite author,"I have been reading John Shannon's Jack Liffey series with increasing excitement - at last, an author who dives headfirst into the complicated and emotionally-charged issues of race and politics, and at the same time writes a hell of a good story. His characters are unique and completely believable. If you love a great story, and are tired of superficial portraits of urban life, I highly recommend a strong dose of Jack Liffey."
2,Why the Kids?,"It's well written and literate, but its passive protagonist and children as heroes/victims just don't engage the reader. Why are these kids wandering around the middle of an urban riot? How does our hero so easily find a child stolen by bikers, who really aren't so bad after all?"
3,Shoulder Pads,The pads are very nice but they are just a little too wide for my shoulders. Need to have some a little less wide.
5,Finally -- a customer-centered marketing approach,"This is must reading for the serious marketing strategist. It's a prescient look at how companies will have to interact with customers in order to break through communication clutter and sustain growth. I plan to use it as a regular reference for strategic planning. The section on customer care is an important addition to the current thinking about marketing communications. I like that it lays out a disciplined process for creating, implementing and measuring effective programs that provide lasting value, not just tactical applications. The last chapter of checklists alone is worth the price of the book."
1,so far I can't get the dvd to even play,"I sent an inquiry to ""beyourowncontractortrainingdotcom"" on their web site so far no response. There's no way on their web page to tell if your request even went thru or if it just deleted whatever you wrote.I've tried the dvd on 2 different computers; so far it won't play period; the menu comes up but nothing else.Not even VLC media player will play it.The disc uses some odd player; ""cyberlink powerdvd""? never heard of it and I wish I hadn't; in any case nothing!Come on ""beyourowncontractortrainingdotcom"" help me out!"
4,Very nice,"it was nice, all that was should have been sold in these packages are bottles of ink but it doesnt cast too much to get ink anyways. Using the pens offers a unique experience and the book fully explains how to take care of them."
1,From Zero to... ZERO (too bad there aren't zero stars),"This ""game"" is completely pricey & completely awful in ways no sane person should be aware of. Don't buy it. It was penned by a madman who should be banned from sane society - forever. The Wraeththus (the main ""characters"") are absolutely unplayable, & for that matter, so are the humans (the other characters). It's a waste of dead tree pulp. I repeat: DO NOT BUY THIS; do yourself (& your sanity, a favour)."
5,Great storyline,After a visit to the island I was totally fascinated with the culture. I will be reading and visiting the island this part of the country much more.
2,One of my favorites,"This is one of my favorite books... I had the opportunity to go to Sapaelo Island and stayed at the author's guest house. It was a unique experience and the books wonderfully shares the life of her ancestors on the island. Heartwarming and funny!GOD, DR BUZZARD AND THE BOLITO MAN:A Saltwater Geechee talks about Life on Sapleo Island."
3,Should've Stuck In The REHAB program,"Brooks & Danny Boone Destroyed 3 Albums Together as a Group!Solo Was Not The Way To Go For Brooks,He Was Picked Up From So So Def & Droped Just As Quick!This Cd Was Never Released In The USA!It Has Alot Of Great Tracks But Most Are Remixes Of Songs He Already Had!REHAB Is Still Playing Out Doing Shows & Recording Music We Haven't Seen Or Heard A Thing From MR.Buford???Bartender & 1980 Are Getting Air Play Daily & All This Without Brooks?Leads Me To belive He Should've Stuck in The REHAB Program!"
4,SMALL,REALLY LIKE THEM. BUT THEY RUN REALLY SMALL. I ORDERED 1/2 SIZE BIGGER AND THE ARE STILL VERY SNUG.
4,so cute,"I ordered these for a disco party and they are so cute! I love them. The calf is super skinny, but if you work long enough you can get the zipper up and it will stretch a little bit. They are super comfortable to walk in. Love love love them."
5,"Pure piano, pure Lorie, pure pleasure","Lorie plays with ease, skill, and dexterity that soothes and amazes. She did ""Blowing in the Wind"" as a conclusion to one of my Chapel talks - it is here in all of its intricate, melodic glory. She carries you back and forth with imaginative trills between the theme notes. A wonderful adventure!"
3,Good but too little,"After a year of training Savate there was very little this DVD offered for me.Chouaref if clearly highly skilled in this sport but the DVD is just too short and contains way too little pointers and the combinations taught are for the most part too typical.Bonuses included 3 clips from combat savate matches, of which 2 were pointless almost-instant knock-outs."
5,"Know the Truth, A Handbook of Christian Belief",Bruce Milne's book is a welcomed book on doctrine in a time when doctrinal material is sorely lacking. It is well organized and easy to read. It can serve as an excellent reference book. It also serves well one who simply wishes to think about God and his nature using the Scripture in a way it was intended to be use.
2,New Edition Strongly Supports Man Made Global Warming,"I found the previous edition of this book to be excellent.[1998] It was a wonderful reference for the basic christian doctrines and I used it often. I bought 4 of this updated version with the goal of studying it with my children. As other reviewers have stated I have always appreciated this author for his lack of dogmatism where it is not founded. In this edition he however gives strong support for man made global warming.{pages 116-117} He speaks of it as an ""impending doomsday senario"" caused by our dependance on carbon fuels, coal and oil. Even while admitting that some still question the scientific basis for this idea he wholheartedly urges an international response to this ""crisis"" The last sentence in the section is, ""How can anyone claim allegiance to Jesus Christ and his command to 'love our neighbour', and be careless of the call to play our part in the reduction of global warming?"" I am returning these and purchasing the 1998 edition."
2,It's Okay,Required book for school course. Difficult to understand what the author is saying. Lots (lots!) of big words. Read with a dictionary.
5,Uplifting and Delightful,"This is a marvelous collection of light, memorable tunes by a talented pianist and small backup pop orchestra. ""Heart & Soul"" is just plain neat. ""The Harvest"" features the piano and violins; it just sounds midwest. And if you don't find yourself tapping your foot to ""The Penguin Shuffle,"" you'd better check your pulse.I play this CD over and over, and never tire of it. It's light; it's easy; it's just plain fun to listen to.Buy this album; if you don't like it, I'll buy it back from you. Although how they get all this terrific music out of Minnesota is absolutely beyond me. - jjt3d@aol.com"
4,Great display item,"I bought this for my husband - he has a little ""toy"" collection on his desk at work. I don't know that I would recommend this for a child to actually play with, but it's nice for display."
4,future toy,"I liked the car since i first opened it out of the box,great detail of the movie car and the box looks great to display the car in.The car looks amazing on my shelf for everyone to see.I also got my brother one,since we're huge back to the future fan's,and this is a great collectable for fan's of the movie's or 80's."
4,Excellent midnight snack.,"This is one of my favorite Tasty Bite entrées. It is spicy hot, but not at all too hot, with a noticeable ""curry"" flavor. The addition of the cashews makes for a nice flavor note (although I could do without the whole chile pod). I take mine in a mug with a pat of butter floating on top for a just-before-bed stomach warmer, but you could easily pour it over rice for a quick, easy, and tasty lunch, far more nutritious than a bowl of instant noodles. By the way, the combination of puréed greens and green peas is a terrific idea. I'd give this five stars if the peas weren't a little too redolent of the can. And, with the free shipping, this is a terrific price."
4,Yum!,"This isn't my favorite Tasty Bite meal, but it's definitely up there. I enjoy this with naan or couscous. You basically just have to like peas and Indian spices to like this."
3,The untold story,"To read the untold story of the making of the Box Set, see Ray Carney's Cassavetes web site (available through any search engine). It's a scream."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS!,Please do not support this release of Cassavetes' films by Criterion Collection. Purchasing this DVD set constitutes a denigration of real criticism and suppresses the appreciation and comprehension of true art. The troubling circumstances leading up to the release of this edition (in which world-renowned Cassavetes critic Ray Carney was snubbed and fired after his work was completed) are absolutely pathetic and embarrassing for both Criterion and Miss Rowlands.
2,Boo Hiss to Criterion for Ditching Ray Carney,"These are great films and the set is lovely. But boo to Criterion anyhow for not sticking up for Cassavetes scholar Ray Carney, whose name was removed from the set after months of work because of his feud with Cassavetes' widow Gena Rowlands. Buy the DVD set, anyhow, you must, but go to the Cassavetes pages, find Carney's links, and read his account of the troubles he's had, trying to preserve and expose people to rare cuts of FACES and SHADOWS he himself tracked down... Sorry to take sides -- Gena Rowlands probably has her own justifications for feeling as she does -- but I greatly admire Carney's contributions to keeping Cassavetes' memory alive and exposing people to his films; he put an amazing amount of work into CASSAVETES ON CASSAVETES, too. It sucks that he kind of got stiffed here."
5,where's Husbands and Lovestreams?,"This collection would be perfect if it included Husbands and Lovestreams,Husbands, a deep yet surprisingly accessable masterwork. Lovestreams, containssome of Cassevettes and Rowlands finest acting and a chilling portrait of brilliant alcoholic on his final decent into madness and despair. It is also a heartbreaking study of love between a brother and sister. Rowlands as Cassevettes' sister on her own journey back from the edge of madness. Bittersweet and brilliantly played. Seymore Cassell as Gena Rowlands' Husband is perfect."
4,A really great game.....,"What a classic!! This shows nearly all the poor genesis RPGs (with a FEW exceptions) how an RPG should be made. It has brilliant characters, some great bad guys (Zio, can you get cooler?) and fills a lot of gaps in the excellent (Except for PS3) overall Phantasy Star storyline. If ure thinking about getting a Genesis for old times sake, get this and Shining Force 2, as they really are it's two best games."
4,Awesome.,"This is an excellent game for the old Sega Genesis, keeping in line with the cool Phantasy Star series. This one is the best on the Genesis though, so if you must choose one, this is the game to get.It's much better than Phantasy Stars 2 and 3 in just about every way. I won't even comment on 3 though... that game was just a poor excuse for a sequel, I'm afraid. Anyway though, Phantasy Star 4 keeps tradition with the technological setting, the cool techno music, stylish anime graphics, and unique storylines.The characters are quite interesting as well, particularly Alis and Rune. I don't have too much to say about the game, unfortunately, since I happened to have a defective copy. However, from what I did play of it, it was definitely the best in the series, for the Genesis at least."
1,so....overrated.....,I do not see what is so good about this game. Super Nintendo RPG's are much much better. The character look like Michael Jackson especially Chaz Ashley (*snicker*). I do not see why you can not change the names of your character. The battle system has very little charm and is not fun. The towns are extremely uninteresting especially all of Motavia. I was hoping that Dezolis's towns would be interesting but I was wrong. The music is pollution to the ears. I agree completely with the other one-star review on this. If you want to play some truly awesome rpg's get a Super Nintendo.
1,Worst game ever,This is just another cheesy rpg for sega. Sega just cant make a good RPG. If your looking for RPGs get a super nintendo. For the mean time stick with sonic and kid chameleon.
5,Beautiful,"Perfect after a long day of work, this CD will relax and entertain you. Lorie Line's original compositions are just as beautiful as her arrangements of popular songs. My favorites include Love Is, Minuet in G, Gentle In The Night, and Tears In Heaven."
3,Great!,"Really lovely...however, the ending so hazy! The whole THING so hazy! ... Kind of annoying...Don't get me wrong, it's an awesome book. If you like the other Kel books, you've just got to read it. Aside from the love interest factor, the ending's very nice. I hope Pierce will do what she did with the Circle books and pick Kel's story right back up--maybe a year or two later, but she SHOULD! Maybe with less emphesise on war--as it really is a war book.But a good war book!"
5,Great Book,"Why do some people think that this wasn't up to Tamora Pierce's normal standards? No, Kel doesn't have any interesting romances, but think about it this way: have you ever found her books somewhat boring whenever it came to the battle aspect. This changes all that. The battles are extremely interesting. Because she doesn't have a romance like Daine and Alanna do, there is so much more to do with her character, and there isn't always a man hovering in the background. This is a great book. Get over it and read the book, or you will be missing something great."
1,Kindle ed. was messy,"Lady Knight: Book 4 of the Protector of the Small QuartetI purchased the kindle edition of this book and was dissapointed by the formatting. There were numerous punctuation and spelling errors ( particularly any word with a double f in it) and a whole section where dialogue was supposed to be in italics to differentiate between characters was hopelessly jumbled. I hope that this author's others works faired better in the kindle format, because I love this series and this book."
2,Lady Knight,"I thought this book was good,but not as good as Pierce's previous books. In Lady Knight, it seemed that Kel's attitude changed,and she seemed less human. The book did not play as heavily on her faults as the others did. There was no mention of her fear of heights. While it was a wonderful tribute to those who died in 9-11, the book itself was sadly lacking. The climax was built up remarkably well, but the book just. . . ended. In this book, Kel seems more superhuman, and less kind towards people. Her treatment of Tobe and several of the others in the camp reflects this. I didn't like that part. The book also doesn't mention some of the things that were very important to Kel in Squire, Page, and First Test. It was like Kel was truly a noble, and not someone who was kind and fair to people. Though she was very fair in her treatment with people in this book."
1,REALLY BORING,Kel just seems so dumb. Like the other books in this series the plot line moves along slowly and then something will happen and Kel will save the day. There really aren't any surprises. I couldn't even get through this last book. Just so disappointed since the Lioness books and The Immortals books were soooooo great!
3,In Between....,"I can hardly believe this is Tamora Pierce's! What happened to Cleon? Maybe Kel doesn't have to ""end up"" with someone at eighteen, but it would have been nice to know that she would not have ended up an old maid. I didn't like the violence, partially because it happens too much in OUR world- why stuff it into books, too? But all in all, a good book with a surprising ending, most definitely."
2,It might as well have been cardboard.,"When Tamora Pierce started out writing about Tortal, her work was not excellent, but it made for an enjoyable read and the characters were easy to empathize with. She seems to have lost touch with that writing style somewhere along the way. This final book is pretty boring. It is difficult to empathize with any of the characters because they all seem to lack any genuine emotions. Everything seems fake and forced. A good rule for writers is 'show, don't tell;' a rule which seems to have been utterly abandoned by Pierce. She over-describes everything, spending far too much of her time and the reader's on unnecessary details that only hurt the story. She uses choppy sentences and spells everything out instead of letting the story flow. I had really hoped for better from her."
2,a huge letdown,"Tamora pierce had been one of my favorite authors for 4 years. Every year, twice a year I getexcited waiting for one of her books (that I'd pre-ordered) to come out. They've always been excellent before. This one was the last in a series, and quite possibly the last tortall series. I was jumping up and down in excitement when i got it. Then, I read it. I didn't get too far before my excitment ebbed. Kel seemed a less likeable person than before, and the entire book dragged, while being totally predictable. Considering how good Pierce's books have been in the past, I was disapointed and upset, and wish that such a good series had come to a better end."
4,"once again, Pierce has done it!","I really loved this book, just as I loved the others. However, I only gave it a four because, like others have written, I felt that Pierce should have included a new love interest for Kel. The break- up with Cleon was kind of expected, and even though the author hinted at Dom, I would have preferred the book if she had included bits of Dom and Kel getting together. Maybe Pierce should write a 5th book??But overall, it was brilliant! A wonderful conclusion to the series."
3,A bit of a let-down,"I have to say, this quartet doesn't at all match up with the rest of Tamora Pierce's. This is my least favourite book of hers so far. The usual *spark* just isn't there...basically the whole book is about Kel's days as a knight and her leadership over Haven, the fort that she has been assigned to run. When disaster strikes, she goes to the rescue. She and Cleon split up, and she never does get together with anyone else...I was rooting for Dom, lol. Anyways, if you've read the other 3 Protector of the Small books, you should read this one just to finish it off, but don't expect anything great."
3,Very Dissappointed,"I have been a Tortall fan since the beginning, and I must say this book was severely disappointing. No romance, barely any comedy, the book seemed to have one focus; war. In a time when all one has to do is turn on their television set to invite war into their livingroom, most of us really enjoy those fleeting moments when we can immerse ourselves in a land of fiction. We don't need war there too. I am really hoping that there will be a 5th book--not to offset Pierce's set-in ways about only having 4 in each series--but to try and make up for the pitiful ending she left this one with. Very disappointed."
5,Amazeing --- as per Pierces usual,"Lady Knight, the conclusion to The Protector of the Small series was one of the best books iv read. Its a gripping tale of adventure and excitement. Kels friends never cease to Amaze me in their loyalty, while Kels growing knoweldge as a commander is inspiring. Its a great book that every Tamora Pierce fan should read, as well as all fanasy lovers. The characters grow on you and kels friends become your friends. As always, Tamora Pierce's books are some of the best on the market."
4,great book,"This was a great book that I think made kel grow into herself very well. I rhink that if you are looking for romance, and don't find any in this book,don't complain. this is not a romance novel. I also like this ending better than the oh-so-perfect endings to Allana and Daines books."
3,hmmm... kinda dissapointed,"Honestly, i wasnt really expecting this book to be good. Usually tamora peirce writes well, but the book previous to this one (Squire) i didnt find that exceptional. so i figured this one would be the same sappy mushy ""i dont know who i love"" kinda book. i was very wrong. i started reading it, and was very excited! it wasnt like that! it was very well written. howerver, everything got really easy in the end. it was TOO easy. also, instead of minimising the amount of romance, she eliminated it entirely... it doesnt really match up and the reader is left feeling like the story is unfinished. she should write another to tie it up"
3,Disapointing,"I've been waiting for months for this book to come out. So I was disapointed to see the results. The book wasn't bad, but it was not as good as the rest of the series. Things didn't go as I had hoped with Cleon. There wasn't enough romance ether. And the book ended too fast. Don't get me wrong, the book was still good. Kel saved many lives and she finaly got to command. I just exspected better."
4,alanna dragondancer's opinion,i really enjoyed this book but i felt that this series (protector of the small) wasn't finished.i would really like another novel about Kel. another problem was the complete lack of romance! in all her other tortall series the last book was the one with all the romance and this one had nothing.i was really surprised and quite disapointed but the book was still great and very moving.i'd give it 4 and a half if i could
4,Lady Knight,Tamora Pierce has outdone herself again. She has cooked up a wonderful book to end this exciting series. She has given this book everything it needs to become great. With a thick plot and many twists and turns this book will keep readers on the edge of there seats and drolling for more. I would recommend this book to anybody above 10 who loves a great fiction book.
1,I can't believe people can read this stuff.,"this book shouldn't be labeled as for young adults it should be labeled for little kids and maybe young adults who are followers. these type of stories get the volume turned down after you've read books like fight club, and a clockwork orange. if you truly want to start reading things that are less predictable and less trite read those two books, then see if you want to return to this stuff"
5,Ultimate clamps,"The sad thing about life is that when we're young most of us simply cannot afford the best things and learn to make do with whatever we can afford.After decades of ""making do"" with cheap clamps I finally broke down and purchased a couple of Bessey K clamps.These clamps turned out to be so good that I just had to go buy more of them.These clamps are simply the best that can be bought."
5,Great!,Works just as well as I thought it would. Won't ever regret this purchase. Makes face framing easy. Great companion to my Kreg pocket hole jig kit.
3,Good Item,"These are excellent clamps except for one thing. Until they're clamped tight, they're constantly slipping and sliding all over the place. Near impossible to use with one hand. A lot of clamps are awkward to use so that's not all that unusual but these seem to be worse than most."
2,"over-hyped, now made of imported material","Success seems to have sunk Bessey's rising star. Their clamps are now made of ""imported material"" (a creative way of avoiding having to write ""Made in China""?) and assembled in the US, but even the most skillful surgeon can't save a man with faulty organs. Case in point--the plastic clamps that keep the sliding head from slipping off the bar are flimsy plastic, and mine already are breaking. Jorgensen, on the other hand, is more intelligently designed, using a cotter pin to hold the plastic stop in place. Jorgensen also has wider and longer clamping surfaces.If you must have designer names, no one will talk you out of buying Bessey. On the other hand, if you want the best product for your dollar, look at Gross Stabil (made in Germany) or Jorgensen (made in the US)."
4,Old School Role-Playing,This game is great to anyone who likes rpg's and military stratagy all in one. The graphics aren't the best but who needs graphics when the game is fun and exciting. Also the music in the game is pretty cool.
3,"Very mixed, and not much science","Although fascinating in parts, and full of good human interest stories about scientists and how they really work, this book is strangely disorganized and vague on the science of electricity. If the author had abandoned his lengthy fixation with British exploits in WWII, he would have had room to at least mention Tesla, the AC/DC controversy, and more of the physics involved. At times I thought the publisher had accidently bound in large chunks from a popular history of the world wars, as electricity simply disappeared from whole chapters. Was this something left over from another project whcih the author decided to recycle?"
1,Price was right,"My wife picked this up at a rummage sale, thinking it looked like something I'd enjoy. The first thing I did was check the index for 'Tesla'. When I found no reference to him I immediately knew that the book was lacking, and checked Amazon's reviews, which confirmed my suspicion. Oh well, my wife meant well, and it may be worth what she paid."
3,Electric Universe,"'Electric Universe' is a short, fascinating book that touches on many facets of electricity and it's use and application. It leaves you with many questions and makes you want to explore some of the themes in greater depth, which is either a positive or negative conclusion depending on your take. I found it to be immensely easy to read, but superficial and light. It explores the ideas around electricity well without being truly illuminating or deeply informative. This is a great science primer and a good place to start if you want a try a 'popular science' book, but if you've read other science books, or have a passing knowledge of electricity and scientific development in that past 100, years then you can give this a miss without any qualms. A solid three star book, good but not excellent.Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page."
3,Ambitious Title for a Lightweight Book with some Interesting Facts,"The reader should understand that this author picked a huge subject and out of that book he follows a few interesting sidelights. The book's contents is like a rock skimming across the surface of a lake, Where the rock hits, there is an interesting story, but do I feel like I know about the lake? This author has an interesting style, his E=MC2 book dealt with a narrow subject (an equation). This book is a fast read with interesting facts, but of course it can not cover the scope of the title"
2,Where's The Beef?,"This book is comprised of a series of 12 loosely related essays. The writing style is appealing. The general focus on the mystery of electricity, its many expressions and the history of discovery is interesting. However ... some of the essays are weakly researched and written. The author inserts nonsequitors and irrelevant comments, as if no editor reviewed the work. The scientific explanations are adequate, but not insightful. The flow through history is tenuous. There are better works of science, history and biography in this area."
4,Nice sound,"I ordered this cha-cha bell for my grandson, the budding drummer. He liked it very much. Had a nice tone to it. Very well constructed too. Price could have been a little more reasonable, though.Overall, a great addition to any drum set."
3,tai smallwood math review,"Great book for referencing activities to engage young learners in their discovery of mathematics. As the Community Liason for an Exceptional After School Math Enrichment program, I am happy to encourage parents to read more to learn more about the many ways children can learn math. If you visit us at [...]you can learn more about our unique, hands on learning approach to mathematics learning experiences for Preschoolers. You may reach me directly at 703-232-1669. Tai Smallwood."
2,Whole language a failure - whole math is no better,"The concept of whole language when implemented in California in the 80s was a total debacle and I see that there are still books out there promoting the ""whole"" concept, only this time it is in math. Use this book only in addition to tried and proven ways of teaching math."
5,An impulse buy with zero regrets,"Recently moved into an old house that will need a lot of work over time. I was a plumbing contractor in my youth and did a fair amount of framing & finish carpentry on various bathroom redos. But I had used my boss's tools and did not have a big collection of my own stuff. So I am in the process of building up my inventory and I brought this cordless drill on an impluse. I have used Millwaukee saw-alls (own one), right angle drills, hole hogs as well as a circular saw (own one) and have always been impressed with their robustness. I was equally impressed with the cordless drill. I took apart a swimming pool deck on a single charge and have used it to mix a 5 gallon pail of mortar without a whimper. It is also not too heavy or bulky for inside finish stuff too."
4,What could be more fun than rhyming and teamwork?,"This fun to read book chronicles a day in the life of Farmer Dale, and several other animals in the town. When Farmer Dale begins his journey to the county fair, he stops first to pick up Bossy Cow, who is in need of a ride. As the book continues, more and more characters with their own savvy traits are introduced. They all need rides to the fair and Farmer Dale is willing to help. There are just two problems: Will all of these animals fit into Farmer Dale's red pickup truck? Will the truck be able to last the whole ride to the county fair? Read this exciting book to find out! Filled with rhymes, repetition, and a moral at the end, it is a great read for Pre-K through 2nd graders."
3,"Worth the used price, not cover price.","There are many reviews that suggest the story in this book is taken care of adequeately enough in the first page of the Planet Hulk book. I didn't listen and bought this one anyway. Those reviews were true, this book is unnecessary if you plan on buying planet hulk, unless you want the information provided at the very end which has nothing to do with the story, it just explains much about many characters involved with the entire Hulk legacy. There is very very little if anything at all about the decision the Illuminati made to send the green giant away, just the implementation of their decision. If you're looking for that (which i was) look for the Road to Civil War book. It's in the beginning of that. The artwork in this is very nice and it's well written, but the story is short and unneccessary."
3,short,the handbook was pointlessthe story was short and bland.i'd suggest skipping this and reading the much better planet hulk.if you're going to buy this buy it used and pay what you really should.
2,Not Essential for planet hulk,"I had recently read the planet hulk hardcover and had read the original Illuminate oneshot that showed the decision on what to do with the Hulk. So i was looking foward to finally picking this up.Basically it sets the stage for how the hulk ended up in space. But it is pretty lackluster. Do yourselves a favor and read the oneshot, or the Road to Civil War trade instead, that includes the illuminati oneshot that shows the decision.Also half this book is made up of Hulk Handbook 2004, which is useless. it is just profiles on hulk characters that is a waste of space and paper. It is just fluff to add more bulk to this already slim book."
3,"Interesting, Although Unnecessary and Lacking Entertainment","As a prelude, it's interesting to see how Nick Fury and the Illuminati ""tricked"" Hulk into space, but it's unnecessary--everything you need to know about the storyline is summed up in the first few pages of theIncredible Hulk: Planet Hulkcollection. TheThe Road to Civil Wartrade paperback, reprinting the first Illuminati one-shot, actually shows the five ""heroes"" coming to their decision to shoot the Hulk into space--so I would recommend that book over Daniel Way's stoic execution here."
4,How it all started,"Many reviews have stated that this book is not necessary due to it being summarized in the beginning of Planet Hulk and some of the information in the Illuminati's other appearance. However, if you weren't following the Illuminati's activities or the Civil War material that included them, then it fills in that gap without having to jump to a non-Hulk title. Also, for those complete-ists out there that want the entire story from beginning to end, the only other way to get this story is in the individual monthly issues.If you already know how Hulk got stuck in space, and you don't care about the specifics, then this volume isn't really for you. However, if you're a Hulk fan that wants the whole story from Hulk's perspective, it's definitely worth picking up."
2,Worked great less than a dozen times.,"After jamming a scrap of wood between the blade and the table of my arbor saw and radial arm saw for years I ordered the Bench Dog to get to the free shipping cutoff. Using this to take off the radial arm saw blade for cleaning was EASY. I put it under the blade, lowered the radial arm saw blade into it without exerting much pressure, and took the arbor nut right off. This tool probably saved me 5 minutes. Considering I've installed and reinstalled blades after sharpening (the days when this was normal), and installed new blades to replace old ones (today's normal) perhaps 100 times (not counting Dado blades) this tool could have saved me perhaps 8 or 9 hours of time over 30 years taking off blades and another 8 or 9 hours putting them back on. It's worth the cost.UPDATE - It works great until the inside of the tool shreds off and the it's throw away time. I would not buy another."
5,HAND SAVER,IT WORKS! SO MUCH SAFER THAN THE TWO WRENCH STYSTEM. A MUST HAVE TOOL IF YOU HAVE WEEK HANDS AS I DO
5,Simple and effective,"Yes, it works. Nothing complex - put it over the blade and apply the wrench. No more pieces of wood to prevent the blade turning, no chance meeting of wrench and carbide teeth, nor carbide teeth and fingers. Worth buying."
4,Interesting Polemic,"This book is interesting largely because of its place in history. It was written in 1911 by an African nationalist and expresses his views on colonialism as an educated African who goes to London and then returns to his native land with fresh eyes to the exploitation of his people and possible solutions. While it is a fictional novel, it's long on political speeches. It is said that Marcus Garvey was greatly inspired by this book and it's not hard to see why (in fact, Hayford was later a follower of Garvey). For those who are interested in African history, this makes for fascinating reading."
1,Not worth your time,"I have been taking this now for a few days, and I don't notice any change in my appetite at all. Another bunko hoodia wannabee.Don't waste your money"
3,Rumors,"This product may not be available most of the time, but I would not jump to conclusions. I purchased the display model that Lowe's had. I've had it only a short time so I cannot speak on the durability of the item. It is currently working fine. Shortages might simply be due to the product recently becoming a stocked item for larger hardware stores."
1,Rumors about trouble,It is rumored the delays in production are due to production or design problems with the crystals or laser. Some questions about accuracy and reliability were made. The product may never actually become available.
4,A MUST HAVE TOOL,"These little rotary tools are so useful the possibilities are endless.If your an around the house do it yourselfer or a well seasoned carpenter this little guy will suit everyone.I couldnt even begin to explain all it can do in a short review.Just read the book that comes with the tool and let your imagination and creativity do the rest.Other tool makers produce such a tool but I do think that dremal has inspired them all.My advice is stick with dremal.They are so well made and offer so many options and accessories.You just cant go wrong. Now get out there and polish,cut or grind something."
5,Professional Workhorse,"this tool does not quit, we have owned one for about four years now and use it on a daily basis trimming away fiberglass, the Dremel 395 is an amazing tool w/ a endless lifespan"
4,Experience with Dremel,This tool is perfect for any tool users. It has so many useful needs it compliments any hobbies and other applications. I recommend this tool to anyone.
1,WARNING!!!!!!,"I've had one of these for a year with light use, perhaps once a month. I ran it for a half hour straight today and an internal shaft melted. You've been warned! I'm buying another brand."
5,"Cheese it, The Fuzz!","My Wife and I bought this item for the usual reasons. We washed them and had no problems with fuzzballs or shredding. They're just as soft and sturdy as they were before we washed them, if not a little softer. For the record, we washed them on the cold cycle with other baby clothes. They went through the drier for an hour at the lowest heat setting.Anyway, I'm just writing the review to offset the bad review. There was nothing wrong with the pads that we received, and they do what they're supposed to do-- get between the warm baby and the cold changing table."
2,Regular pads,"This are usefull pads for the changing table, but once I washed them they were all cover with fuzz balls."
2,Terrible,These are only good for 1-2 washes and then they pill and look terrible. I would not purchase again. Sadly there doesn't seem to be too much else out there.
3,Who are the editors?,"I like this CD a lot. I think it features great singers and is recorded well. It's different than most CDs in this series in that it is a cappella and there is a choir, rather than a single worship leader. But they do a great job, and it is worth the purchase price.I am, however, embarrassed for Hosanna! Music because the TITLE OF THE CD is SPELLED WRONG. There is no such word as ""acapella"" despite the fact that one may find it (with that spelling) in many places. The correct spelling is ""a cappella"" - yes, it's 2 words; they are Italian. Because Hosanna! Music is such a large company, and not a home-produced indie records label, I am not going to cut them any slack - you can't tell me they don't have editors. Sorry, Hosanna, you are losing a star for that - because every time I see the cover I cringe inside."
4,Canon Pixma IP1700,"The printer was easy to set up and get operating. It is a lot quieter and faster than the Epson model 820 that it's replacing.The only short coming that I have found to date is that will not accept envelope templates for odd sized envelopes that I had set up for the Epson.Ink usage is better managed by the Canon than the Epson. Also, heads do not need to be cleaned as often.I am waiting for Canon to provide an update to re-activate their ""Easy-WebPrint"" format. The new Explorer 7 will not accept it."
4,Good Home Printer + Entry Level Photo Printer,"Print quality is very good even at draft quality settings. At high quality, the print is perfect for resumes. Print speed is execellent for a home printer. Photo quality is also good. Resolution is clear and colors are pretty accurate. I do not plan on using this much as a photo printer given the high cost of consummables and the abundance of inexpensive online photo printshops.The negatives are as mentioned before, the consummables are expensive: the color inkwell is a single tri-color instead of individual ink wells. Also, the inkwells do not last long and there is not much of a market for cheap suppliers. The printer is rather large and flimsy. There is no USB cable included which is a really poor marketing decision on Canon's part. There's no output tray. I have a narrow leadge for my printer on my computer hutch so I must stand there and catch my printouts."
2,"Cheap printer, expensive ink","The printer produces decent quality pictures, although far from being the advertised ""lab quality."" It also makes a nice document printer with good speed for this price range. The problem with this and many inkjet printers is that it uses ink very fast and a set of cartridges are as expensive as the printer itself. I was only able to print about 10 4x6 pictures set to ""high"" quality plus 120 pages of color documents set to ""fast"" quality before the printer started running low on ink. That results in the worst cost per page I have experienced yet. Inkjet printer manufacturers really have quite a racket going on - they price printers super low to sucker customers into their brand - then rip those same customers off with their short-lived, high-priced ink cartridges."
4,needs outer box,product was just fine but delivery was not to my standards they left on my porch in view of street with original box so all could see luckily it was'nt stolen im in n.y. after all
1,Don't bother,"Canon calls this a photo printer? Prints are faded, blurred, and distorted. Compare this printer to an HP Deskjet 3940 and decide for yourself. Do not invest in this printer. However, if you are stuck with this printer because you bought it as a package deal, either sell it on eBay or give it to your kids. I REPEAT, do not buy this printer, you will be sorry. Every Canon printer I have ever purchased has not met my expectations."
4,"Cheap, Cheerful and Colorful","Cheap color inkjet. Advantage over the HP equivalents is that the ink appears to last twice as long. Fairly robust and fair quality for the cost. Hey, if it breaks, just get another. You get what you pay for."
2,problems with cannon 3000 printer,I cannot print only in black when I am printing text. Thus the other ink cartrages run out of ink causing the printer to stop.
4,good bra ; would like a little wider back band,"I do like this bra but I have a concern 1. when you are bigger on top, the bigger sizes may require more support built in due to the weight of the breast and the stretching that may occur with wear; a little wider back band since it is comfortable and not seen would help to eliminate the tiny back bulge due to the dip of the shoulder strap; the bra feels like nothing on and does uplift to my surprise; there are no hooks so you have to slip into it ; great idea, a little improvement and it would be the ultimate bra for support, comfort etc"
2,Can't support this product,"Or vice versa. This is a fine bra for wearing around the house, but not for anything else. It offers little support for me (34C) and flattens the breasts rather than flattering them. It is comfortable, but not exceptionally so. You can do better.Spanx Bra-llelujah!Spanx Bra-llelujah! Soft Cup BraSpanx Bra-llelujah!"
2,"""Back to the Drawing Board"" Please!","I like lots of Spanx products, so it was with great anticipation that I ordered this bra. I am very disappointed with it, unfortunately. I gave it two stars because it does eliminate bra lines. Other than that, it gives very little support (I am a C cup) and does nothing to make your chest look shapely. Maybe if you are younger and have never had kids, it would be okay. Of course, with implants it might be good too. I found it to ride up. I had to pull it down countless number of times. It is like wearing a sleep bra or a loose sports bra. Definitely not worth the price."
2,Cups roll and straps are NOT adjustable. Skip it!,"For what you pay for this bra, you'd think the straps would be adjustable or the size would at least run true. Or maybe, just maybe, the cups wouldn't roll outwards, making it impossible to wear this item even under a sweater without your cup outlines showing.Sadly, none of these are true. I ordered my same bra size. Not only is the chest too big, the cups are very thick and, as noted, tend to roll outwards--which means less coverage and support.Even the shoulder straps are NONadjustable, and they are HUGE. See the photo? They're easily pulled up that high. A stretchy bra is an ineffective bra. You will be nouncing all over the place in this doozy of an item as you move, ever closer, towards having what Sharon Osbourne calls ""National Geographic boobs."" All this, just to make slightly less apparent the back of your bra showing through your shirt? No way."
1,rides up - impossible to wear!,"I had to return this bra after trying to wear it for one day. It kept riding up so badly that I was afraid I was going to fall out of it every time I moved my arms. I don't know who thought up this product, but they obviously did not test it on real women in everyday activities."
2,Runs Small,"I'm a 34 D in LeMystere Tisha bra (Oprah's T-shirt bra) and I only measure 32.5 around below my breasts, so I thought a 34 C/D would work, especially since it's all stretch! No.... the cups were small but OK, but the band, it was too tight. I say SIZE UP, especially the band - I'm going to try a 36 C/D and if that doesn't work I give up!L."
4,Love it!,"As far as bras go, I love it! (that is from a confirmed bra-hater)I bought it to wear after surgery, however, it was not conducive to wearing just after surgery, as you step into the bra and pull it up to put it on..... No, really! Anyway, it is very comfortable and the nude color does not show up under your clothes."
3,comfortable but rides up in front!,"I love other Spanx products (I wore Spanx under my wedding dress) so I really wanted to like this bra. I will say the material is great and it provides more support than just an average pullover bra top. However, I am a small B and this bra rides up all the time in the front on me. It's really annoying to have to pull it down so I rarely wear it, even at home. If I had paid attention, I would have returned it within the 30 days. I am waiting to hear if Spanx front closure bra has eliminated this problem."
2,Runs really small,it's not wearable for me as and I bought it a size larger than I normally would. maybe If i lose that weight ??
1,Bra-loser,Way too flimsy! Genie bra much better product for half the price. Looks much more substantial in the picture in the pic provided.
2,Spanx Bra-Llelujah Bra .. Not what I expected,"This item was not at all what I expected. While it is comfortable, there was no support at all. I need somthing with no wire but support is everything."
2,More like a sports tank bra,This bra is comfortable but it is little more than a spandex sports cami. It looks like a cut off tank top. The cups are not defined like in the picture. My nipples show through so it would be impossible to wear outside of the house. It flattens rather than flatters. Sizes run small.
2,ok,the fabric feels nice and the straps are comfy BUT the bra rides up as you move around and it acts like a sports bra in the front and tends to flatten you out. wont buy another.
1,UGLY!,"I could have done better with duct tape. Not only does this look unfinished, it takes a double jointed person to attempt to put it in place. Even then it rides up turning it into a tourniquet around your bust. EXTREMELY unflattering in appearance. I certainly don't want anyone to see me wearing this. I can't return this fast enough.Size runs small and is not meant for cup size over a B.It is constricting,flattens your bust line,hot and generally uncomfortable to wear."
1,Disappointed.,"I bought this in the correct size, and the label stated that size, but when I put it on it was small and just crept right up. It wouldn't stay in place and felt awful! This thing may work for people with very small breasts, but if you're larger than an A cup, I'd look for something else. I returned mine."
1,SPANX Bra-llelujah will not last long,"When I first purchased two of these bras for $60+ each I thought they were the greatest as far a comfort goes. Also they did not show through any of my clothes. However, after wearing each bra approx. 10 - 15 times each (with hand washing in cold water with Forever New fabric care wash and laying flat to dry) these bras became all stretched out and unwearable. Like a fool I purchased a third one and after 10 wearings / washing the exact same happened. When I wrote to SPANX they basically blew me off. So between the poor quality and the way they treat their customers I would never purchase another SPANX product again. There are too many good companies that would stand behind their product - and I'll go with them."
1,I wouldn't wish this bra on anyone!,"Wow, I read the reviews and bought the bra anyway -- I really wish I'd listened to what other people who bought it had to say about it! It IS comfortable, the all hosiery thing is a great idea, but it doesn't work!! The bra rides up constantly. I thought it would at least be a good sleep bra, but it rides up so much in my sleep that I end up wearing it around my neck within a few minutes! I wouldn't wish this bra on anyone!!"
1,one wear and it stretched to much for comfort,I love the idea of this product but after one wear it was uncomfortable and not staying in place. I had no idea it would stretch so much. Buy a size or 2 smaller the what you normally ware.
1,Do NOT buy!,"Bought the 34 A/B. This bra is not flattering, and flattens very uncomfortably. I could hardly breathe in it. It also rides up. The straps are too short. Stay well away from this product. Duct tape would work better and be more comfortable."
2,In the Mood Intimates,"The item I received had very clearly been worn. The package was all taped up. The bra had nubs all over it on both sides, you know, that kind that come from being worn, plus it was stretched out. It was so obvious it was not new. I was so upset, I put it aside. By the time I got to dealing w/it, the time expired for me to return it. And I wasnt sure they would believe it wasnt me who wore it. I have checked out what a new looks like, and that is not what I got from this company."
3,Comfortable but too thin,"This bra is very comfortable, but it is too thin for appropriate coverage if wearing a thin and/or close-fitting shirt."
3,COMFY,"EXTREMELY COMFORTABLE. THE STRAPS ARE A BIT WIDE MAKING IT DIFFICULT TO WEAR IT WITH V-NECKS. HAVEN'T WASHED IT YET SO DON'T KNOW HOW IT WILL HOLD UP. IT ALSO HAS A SEAM ACROSS THE MIDDLE OF THE CUP WHICH SHOWS THROUGH SOME SHIRTS. WON'T USE IT FOR EVERY DAY BECAUSE OF THESE ISSUES, BUT MAKES A NICE ALTERNATIVE."
2,"Looks too ""raw"".","The item is comfortable (As advertised) but I was slightly turned off when I removed the packaging and saw how the item looks very ""unfinished"" with multiple seams and sewing lines.Flaws of this product:1) NEVER to be shown to anyone. Really unappealing.2) Doesn't provide enough nipple coverage. Do not wear in cold climates because I swear your nipple will show through.3) Bunches up occassionally during wear.4) The seams and sewing lines show thru t-shirts. :(Overall, this product works very well as a soft bra to sleep or lounge at home in. I would definitely wear this when I get pregnant again. It does provide considerable support (I'm a 38C) but it is a bit too pricey for a soft bra that looks ""unfinished"". Please do not wear this if you are trying to seduce your partner. My husband was APPALLED by how ""raw"" it looks."
4,super comfortable bra for maternity,"I was a B cup and never wore bras before I got pregnant--I hate them, find them so uncomfortable! When I got pregnant, my boobs got bigger and turned into a C cup, and I realize I had to wear something for support. I was excited about finding this bra bc it looked so comfortable--no wires, metal clasps, etc. I was not disappointed--it's extremely comfortable, and supportive as well, and it gives my breast a nice shape. It's also quick thick (double layered?) so your nipple won't show through when you are wearing a smooth t-shirt. It has nice bands that are all around stretchy and comfortable -- don't dig in anywhere. The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is that it tends to ride up a bit -- in other words, it pulls up so that the bottom band comes up on the bottom of my breasts. I just tug it down. It's a little annoying; I suppose they could make the bottom band a little tighter to prevent that. But it's all worth it for the comfort level."
2,useless for bigger sized women!,I bought this bra and I am a 42DD and it did not fit! I was very disappointed. The pictures of it are very misleading! I expected it to have much stronger SPANDEX and be SUPER STRONG. It just failed on all aspects.
2,not worth it,"I thought this bra looked comfortable, but it really it isn't. It pulls up in the back, and I'm constantly pulling it down."
1,It could have killed a lesser woman than me.,"Most uncomfortable thing I have ever struggled into. I waspractically hyperventilating before I could get it off. Needlessto say, I DID NOT like it, and no - I did not order the wrongsize. I Ordered the size I have worn for the last 15 years."
5,Not The Best From The Series,"Personally, I believe this is the worst of the Phantasy Star games, but I'm not saying it's bad. It's a great game the spans over 3 generations. The characters you play depends on your choices. Kinda like what some of the new systems are trying to do now, only sucking at it. Sega was 15 years ahead of their time, and this series proves it.Now more about the game. The gameplay like the others is great, the caves are always changing, and your freedom to roam spans over 7 worlds. And as always you don't have to progress in the story to level up like most RPG's."
5,Good lens for the cost,"This is definitely a decent lens for the cost. No wobble in the glass or the coating, it's nice and clear and doesn't dim or cloud the shots. My only complaint would be that I had to send the first one back for a defect in the glass, but the second (replacement) lens is fine."
5,"Great filter, great price, shipped on time.","Saved a bundle compared to the camera shops in downtown SF. The correct filter shipped on time with no issues. See other reviews below mine which discuss this filter versus B+W and other brands. I read many helpful pieces of advice there before ordering this product.In all, I am glad I have chosen Hoya. I am even more glad that I bought this product on Amazon."
1,Adorama has sent me a used item again!,"I've received this filter in a timely manner.Excited, I've opened the package just to realize that the filter was not sealed. So, I've got a used item from Adorama again. This the 2rd time that Adorama is sending a used item.The first one was a flash card reader.When cleaning it, I was amazed how dirty it was. It is really a shame for a company of this size to send people used filters at full price."
4,deciding on majors,I bought this book to gain a better understanding of what my intended major was about (in depth). So far so good! Thank you!
3,14 towns and hundreds of hours of gameplay!,"The ads and the back of the box for this game a very misleading. Sure you travel around to several locales but the structure of the adventure is very repetitive. It goes like this, go to a town discover the problem and find a map from the townspeople. Then you travel to a cave,it's always a cave by the way and retrieve a lost item of some sort and go back to the town to get a map from another random person to help you find the next location. The action consists of bashing the same monsters and collecting rings from the leader of each town. Overall the game is not terrible and the music is great, I just wish more creativity was used in the dungeon designs. I mean really, by the third or forth cave, I really wish I could slay monsters in a castle or a mountain, maybe a haunted mansion, anything besides a cave. Not awful but do yourself a favor and play Beyond Oasis or one of the Phantasy star games instead."

5,Bessey is the Best,"The Bessey K-Body clamps are--bare none--the finest woodworking clamps that one can buy. The beefy serrated steel bars ensure both clamping power and rigidity, while the unique clamping mechanism guarantees that the clamp faces remain parallel at all times.What this means for the user is quicker setup, tighter joints, and less prolems with racking. Used with the KP blocks included in this kit, these clamps make getting a square joint (almost) automatic.If they're good enough for Norm Abram, they ought to be more than enough for the rest of us. They are."
1,Negative reactions do NOT imply a powerful book,"I feel compelled to highlight that negative reactions do NOT imply a powerful book. The stream of negative responses are concerned primarily with Kim's harassment of women. The book has not 'pinched people's consciences'; rather those who have witnessed him in action feel compelled to speak out. From personal experience, I can vouch for the fact that Christian Kim is a nuisance to women. He is inept at normal adult conversation, talking at you with persistance despite obvious discomfort. This book should never have been written, and Christian Kim should be expelled from Cambridge."
1,Pathetically poor,"This excuse for a book is a joke. Kim's spurious claim that the Cambridge University Law faculty is run by a fascist dictatorship is a complete joke. Kim is a renown 'sex-pest', who prays on first year female law students. Kim's recent behaviour towards students (particularly girls) at Cambridge has landed him in hot water such that he has come close to being 'sent down'. Kim was correctly ejected from the law school library because of his inappropriate behaviour i.e. he was considered a threat to the security of females in the department. Kim is a racist himself so he should be the last person to complain of racism.Kim is a loser, who needs to get out more and learn about social norms, when it comes to relationships with women.This book is a waste of money and consists of lies based upon supposition and distorted logic."
1,Disgusting,"As a Korean, I find the book quite distasteful. Kim has not served the Korean cause well with this ridiculous book. Cambridge University has many Korean's studying there, some of which are doing law. I am fearful that if I were to suffer racism as a result of an anti-Korean backlash arising from the publication of this book, my complaint would be taken less seriously. I find it hard to believe that one of my fellow Koreans could sink so low as to pretend to be suffering from racism just to discredit a law faculty for revenge. I can only assume that Kim picked this habit up in America because we Koreans are a proud people, who were brought up to be truthful, loyal and honourable to the Korean cause.Shame on Kim and his repugnant book!"
1,Rubbish,"This book is total rubbish and it is based on fantasy. I am a black law student at Cambridge and I have never been discriminated - ever. In fact, if anything, the school actively encourages applications from ethnic students. I think that this story is defamatory nonsense. I am sure that the student will be asked to retract these allegations or prove them. The truth is that this man was asked to leave the law school because he repeatedly asked young girls to marry him. Girls that he had not even been on a date with. He is fixated with young women - and I note that he is a middle aged man. He should try to date some people his own age. He is also fixated with law students, because he always dreamed about being a lawyer, but could not get into any law school, due to his poor grades."
1,Disgraceful,"This book is by far one of the worst I've ever read. The content is totally inane. The suggestion that the Law School at Cambridge University is racist and oppressive is absolute absurd. The Law School is one of the most ethnically diverse departments in the university. Many students from Asia, Africa and other areas study there and none have complained about or published any material condeming the department as racist.Kim seems to be a very bitter and twisted person who will stop at nothing to strike out the Law School. I think he probably had an application to the Law School rejected, therefore he wrote this drivel to exact some kind of revenge.This book should be left on the shelf where it belongs."
5,Important Book On Human Rights,It is shocking to see that official coersion is practiced against people of color in this day and age. It's like South African apartheid. How could Cambridge law faculty administrators get away with something like this! Shameful! It is wonderful the Christian Kim is examining this from the perspective of human rights and student rights. He has great insights that will benefit not only Cambridge but all of the world.
1,Complete and utter rubbish,"I was amazed at Kim's capacity for distorting the truth to meet his own vile objective i.e. the harassment and persecution of female students.This book is a mesh of lies and conspiracy theories based with no firm evidence to back them up. As a Jew, I find Kim's hypocrisy somewhat disturbing. Kim preaches anti-Semitic values whilst complaining that he is suffering from racism. I happen to study Law at Cambridge and none of my friends from ethnic minority backgrounds have ever complained of any racism in the Law School.The facts are simple, Kim was ejected from the Law library because he harasses women, I should know as I was one of his victims. This monster touched me inappropriately. My fragile young mind is forever scarred. I hope he rots in hell.Please for the sake of women studying law at Cambridge, do not buy this book."
1,Defamatory drivel,"I can only describe this book as defamatory drivel. The account of the events that supposedly took place at the Law School is completely flawed. There has never been any reported incidences of racism at the Cambridge University Law School. Most students at the Law School give a very different account of the events that took place. The most reliable account of events is that Kim repeatedly harassed and stalked 1st/2nd year undergraduate female Law students and was warned as to his conduct. Kim failed to act on the Law Schools advice and persisted in his attempts to pursue female students, leaving the Law School with no choice but to ask him to leave. Kim refused to leave and the security guards were asked to escort him off the premises as he presented a threat to the female law students.I would certainly avoid this book as it gives a distorted account of the incident from an unreliable source (an author with anti-Semitic views)."
1,Not good to say the least,"I was disappointed at this book by Kim. Kim bases his allegations of racism against the Law School on dubious and circumstancial evidence, which is open to interpretation. Kim distorts the incident that occurred in the Law School to fit his story. Kim has a reputation for pursuing and praying upon female undergraduates, who are half his age. This book should be avoided since it gives a distorted account of what took place."
1,Totally inane,"This book consists of the rantings of a bitter old man, Kim, who has nothing better to do with his life. Kim lives in a fantasy world, where he is allowed to preach anti-Semitism and yet claim to be the saviour of Jews. I think most readers will agree that this is farcical. The book is equally farcical in that it portrays a world class law school with a ethnically diverse student body as racist. It is disgraceful that an author with racist views such as Kim plays the 'race card' to his advantage. Kim was in the wrong, he sexually harassed several female students in the law school. The law school at Cambridge took the appropriate course of action in ejecting him as he posed a serious threat to female students. This book is based on a series of lies, therefore it is best avoided."
1,Libelous rubbish,"The content of this book is totally nonsensical and is based upon the fabrications of a man who has been thwarted in his attempt to harass female students. The author claims that the Law School at Cambridge is racist, this is a total lie. The Law School has actively encouraged applications from ethnic minorities and many have successfully applied and gone on to do well without any experience of racism. In my opinion, Kim is using the race card as a means of exacting his revenge after he was quite rightly ejected from the Squire Law library.This scandalous book is absolute rubbish. Do not give it any credit by buying it, as this will simply improve sales/ratings thus sending out the message that it is alright to play the 'race card' for revenge and financial gain."
1,Inaccurate account of events,"Having read this book and spoken to many LL. B. students at my college (Magdalene, Cambridge), I came to the conclusion that Kim's account of events is a gross misrepresentation.I feel that it needs emphasising that Kim is delusional and suffers from a phantasmagorical myopia when it comes to assessing his attractiveness to women. Kim's inability to deal with his complex about girls has led to a lot of complaints of harassment being made such that the Law School had to take action. There was no racism involved, the Law School was simply carrying out its duty to provide an environment conducive to study i.e. one where students can work without being pestered, distracted or sexually harassed.A friend of mine at Jesus College, where Kim studies, told me that he has been kicked out of his accommodation and is likely to be sent down in the not too distant future."
1,Absolute drivel,This is possibly the worst book I have ever read. I am a student at Cambridge university and it is common knowledge that Kim made unreasonable advances to several female students and was justifiably ejected from the library. To dress this up as racially motivated exclusion is an absolute joke. I have reason to believe that Charles Ingram is an alias of Kim.
1,"Lies, Lies and more lies!","Kim really has excelled himself with this book! The levels of hypocracy have reached a new high. I find it quite ridiculous that Kim complains of racism whilst writing anti-Semitic and racist literature. This book really is a joke, the account of events given by kim is full of inconsistencies and simply fails to add up when all the evidence is considered. My advise is for readers to avoid this book at all costs."
1,A complete fabrication!,"This account of the alleged incident that took place in the Cambridge University Law School is a complete fallacy. Kim distorts and fabricates events so as to make the Law School appear racist and colonialist.The lack of concrete evidence provided by Kim weakens his case considerably. The comments made by the vast majority of reviewers suggest that Kim harassed young females and was ejected after they made a complaint. This interpretation sounds more realistic.Kim's attempt to compare and contrast the regime at the Law School with that in South Africa during apartheid is ridiculous. It is clear that Kim never visited South Africa during this era; otherwise he wouldn't be drawing the aforementioned comparisons.I hear from one of the reviewers that Kim is going to write a sequel to this book. If the first book is anything to go by, one shouldn't expect much from the second."
1,Kim gives fiction a new definition,"As a male undergraduate at Jesus College, Cambridge (where Mr Kim studies), who has on many occasion had to stop him from molesting female members of the College, I feel it is my duty to inform anyone thinking of wasting their money on this book as to how Mr Kim operates. Mr Kim's 'ordeal' with the Law Faculty has as much to do with 'Color, Justice and Due process' as pickled cucumbers have to do with a fruit salad. This book's gross misrepresentation of the situation, where Mr Kim has continually made a nuisance of himself in respect to the female members not only of Jesus College, but also of any female student of Cambridge University he comes into contact with, is to be wholly ignored, and I hope that he gets 'sent down' as soon as possible."
1,Poor quality and poor value for money!,"This book was a waste of money! It contained nothing but lies and distortions of the truth. The author has written racist material in other novels and has the cheek to accuse others of racism - hypocritical or what?The Law School booted Kim out of the library because he was a pest, constantly harassing the girls and playing with their hair etc. Kim should grow up and get a life!This book is a pile of pants."
1,Predictable and boring,"I was very disappointed with this book; it consisted of an inane commentary about a supposed incident that took place in the Law library at Cambridge University. The author tries to exaggerate the event by claiming that it was racially motivated. I find that rather surprising when the Law School at Cambridge has world-class reputation with an ethnically diverse student body. Kim's use of the 'race card' is potentially damaging to race relations as many complaints of racial abuse could be taken less seriously as a result.I have had the misfortune of reading some of Kim's other books, which contain racist material as well as that promoting religious bigotry. This book belongs on the scrap heap."
1,Dreadful,"This book is a total disgrace, it is full of falsehoods, exaggerations and misinterpretations. Kim made out that the Law School at Cambridge University is inherently racist. As an LLB student at Cambridge I find this assertion patently absurd, especially when you consider how many ethnic minority students are studying law here. I know for a fact that Kim has approached many of my friends whilst they were queuing to buy a sandwich from the snack counter in the lower level of the Squire Law library. Kim harassed one of my friends for weeks with emails saying how he loved her and wanted to marry her etc. Many of us decided enough was enough and that we had to make a complaint to the librarian about Kim's actions. This is the real reason why Kim was ejected from the library. My friends and I are pleased that he has been banned since we can study in peace without looking over our shoulder for fear of Kim.Please don't buy this book."
1,Boring,"When I bought this book, I was hoping for an exciting and controversial interpretation of an incident that apparently took place in the Law School at Cambridge. I started reading and found after about 10 pages, I could read no further. It was so boring! Kim just ranted on about a minor incident and tried to put different spins on it so as to exaggerate it. Kim claimed that he was ejected from the law library on the grounds of his race. Kim then goes on to compare this trivial incident with major acts of racial oppression such as that experienced by coloured people in South Africa during apartheid.This sounds like a lot of all nonsense to me. I would avoid this one as most readers will get bored after 10 pages."
1,crap,"The content of this book is complete rubbish. I've never read such a poor quality book before in my life. Kim is clearly defaming the Law School at Cambridge because they kicked him out for sexually harassing the female student. Kim is playing the race card as a means of getting revenge and not because of any racial discrimination. This book is a complete joke, therefore I recommend that you avoid it all costs."
5,Precision miters!,"This is a bit pricey, but not much more than similar models from various manufacturers. If you make only 90 degree cuts, then it is a waste of money to buy this. But once you set this miter gauge for perpendicularity to the blade, all the other angle cuts are very precise -- I checked the various settings with my Bosch electronic protractor and Master Plate. It is great comfort to know that I am cutting precise 45 degree miters without having to check the settings everytime beforehand. The micro-adjusting slider resulted in no play at all on my Delta Contractor's Saw miter slot. Well-machined and constructed, it should hold up to years and years of use. Highly recommended."
2,There are better miter gauges,"The INCRA 2000 has two faults.1) The Angle bracket that holds the fence is just a bent piece of steel. Mine was far from square and had a slight twist. Tired of the recommended shimming to correct, I made my own from angled stock.2) The handle easily comes loose in use, allowing the fence to move on the base plate during a cut."
4,Great Service,"Not only do I feel that I got value for money, but I would liketo express my delight...[in the service I received]. I had to make noadjustments to the miter bar to fit my Sears table saw."
2,Not Worth It,"I have owned the Incra Miter Gauge (bought before they started different models) for a couple of years and would have to say it is not worth the cost. I cannot begin to estimate the amount of time I have spent trying to set it to get a consistent 90 deg cross cut. I finally gave up and got a similar product from a different company for less, and although it is not dead accurate - its closer than I ever got with the Incra. Many claim success - but I have to wonder how long it took them to get it that way - and does it keep its setting, mine does not. Good Luck."
5,Cyberchase: Totally Rad,"Like all of the PBS productions, Cyberchase is a wonderful tradition for young imaginations. It provides not only entertainment but incorporates a learning element that is difficult for young mind not to enjoy"
3,Dated material,"There is some useful information, but a lot of it is dated. The problem is, there are very few books on starting a resume writing business, so beggars can't be choosers!"
4,much smaller than expected!,These drops are incredible tasting!! The only thing is that the tubs are much smaller than expected. But the 'personal size' works great too! We gave a few of the tubs away at a party! My kids LOVE them and I feel good letting them have them because they're organic.
5,Excellent reference for collectors.,I am not a really serious collector but have a few nice examples and simply wanted a book that would give me an idea of what to look for in adding to my modest group.This is an excellent book and exactly fits my needs.
2,Should have bought the multi-speed model.,"This Dremmel tool worked ok for a few jobs, but having only one speed limits its use. It didn't come with any adapters either. Wish I would've spent the extra money for a more versatile tool."
2,Poor design and cheap parts,"I have had bad luck with Dremel: My Dremel tool, after only occasional, non-abusive, uses now refuses to spin, even though the motor itself is reving up fine.So I opened the tool up to see what was wrong, and discovered that there is a clear rubber (yes, rubber!) bushing that is tasked with connecting the motor's considerable torque to the tool's rotating shaft. This soft bushing had -- no surprise here -- torn to shreds. How the Dremel engineers thought that rubber, instead of metal (or even a ""Space Age"" plastic, if you still want to be really cheap but a bit tougher than rubber) was a good idea, I can't say.Perhaps they have now improved this fault on all newer models, but for now I am buying the much superior Black & Decker RTX-B 3 Speed RTX RotaryBlack & Decker RTX-B 3 Speed RTX Rotary Tool with Storage Case-- and for only thirty bucks!"
3,"Dremel 100-N/10 MultiPro 1.15 Amp 35,000 RPM Rotary","i think you need the Variable speed from 5,000 to 35,000 rpmi tried this one and it was on full speed all the timeso i could not adjust the speed for the job i wanted to doand actually the speed of 35.000 rpm is very high ,so if you ok with that buy this one .but i returned this one and bought the fullVariable speed from 5,000 to 35,000 rpm and it is actually perfect ."
2,"High price, good information but not worth it!",This was not worth the cost!!! It should be in hard cover for the price. Outrageous! One of the first times I felt like sending a book back.
4,On time,The book came on time before my class start it is neat and not that many marks in the book. I love the price better then the price in my book store
2,The Importance Of Being A Cliche,"*** This comment may contain spoilers ***Yet another tale of gay doom and gloom, of another sad old closet case and his rosy cheeked ruffian of a love object, of unrequited lust with the inevitable gay-bashing episode thrown in...this time set in Dublin in 1960 - not that you'd tell from the inappropriate haircuts or Finney's dreadful accent!What was the point...really? The film tells us nothing new. It neither illuminates or entertains. Why cast English actors faking the ""Orish""? Why bother casting Brenda Fricker in such a nothing role? And as for referencing Oscar Wilde yet again? *YAWN* Change the record, why don't you?!!Despite its ""Fairytale"" ending, this film is simply a rehash of worn out old clichés. (Would his passengers really have publicly stood up for a ""sodomite"" in Catholic Ireland in the 60s? - Dream on!)Inauthentic, boring and clichéd. Not recommended."
5,back in the day.,"I used to watch this show every week. It was funny,it had drama,it had a dancing baby,I mean really.Totally 90's."
5,Terrific Discovery. (And I'm talking about the book!),"I actually picked up this book in a used bookstore and read the back cover. The facts surrounding the discovery of the planet were new to me. (Kind of embarrassing really that I had never heard it before. Remind me to contact the secondary school I attended!!) In any event, I was enamored by the discriptions on the back cover and bought it for around four or five bucks. I read it in less than a day, which for me is an extreme rarity. I usually spend my time in the ""shallow end"" of the literary pool, reading books that can only be described as ""easy"" reads. This is one of the most entertaining books I've read in years. Unfortunately, I lent the book to someone who had more of a background in astronomy who must have known the book's true value and I haven't seen the book (or the guy) since. So I'm back here to purchase another copy. This time I am much more certain of my investment."
2,You get what you hopefully paid for,It started to get fun but then even with the minor twists it became incredibly redundant. Ultimatly it was an rpg without any real plot. Or the plot was beyond me. The ending was quite a let down and the nonlinearity of the story seemed like it was more slapped together to be depressing hoping youd overlook the fact that there wasnt much substance. It does provoke a bit of thought but... i considered it a complete waste of my time.
3,Pretty good except for Plowboy,"This guy is funny and you have to be wanting to laugh if you are going to hear this cd but there a few songs that give me a headache. Every song is pretty good the only really bad one where I think he has gone to far is Plowboy it is just to rap, a mess, and is pretty bad to even see Cletus sing a song like that. WARNING THIS IS A FOOLISH ALBUM MADE BY A FOOL."
4,Great Hair Trimmers,I actually purchased these to trim the hair on my Bichons (they do not have fur they have hair) and they work very well.
3,"Ok, but not great","This is ok and good when you are short on time. Add some bread to make it a more filling meal. It's a bit spicy, but not over the top. For context: I prefer the ""mild"" salsa and find ""hot"" way too much. Judge your own preference. It has 510 mg/sodium per serving and one bag is two servings. Something to keep in mind. Cut back on salt the rest of the day if you plan to eat a package of this for lunch or dinner. The brand's spinach paneer dish is better."
2,Where's the eggplant?,"This looks awful, tastes much better than it looks; but I couldn't taste the eggplant at all. If you're thinking of buying this because you love eggplant, you will probably be as disappointed as I am."
4,"Great curry, already went through 8 boxes in under 2 weeks","I've ordered several ready-made packages from Amazon and they are mostly hit and miss. This is one of the hits. The curry flavor is authentic and goes well with rice. It get's even better if you slice a few small 1.5""x1.5"" cubes of Asian eggplant on some olive oil and chili or crushed peppers with onions."
3,Would have liked the eggplant to have more texture,"I love eggplant and I know it's not difficult to see from the picture that it's mostly pureed, but I had hoped it would have a little more texture. Overall, this one was just 'ok' for me. A few cubed pieces or hardy chunks of eggplant would have made all the difference. I also found the flavor to be a little more mild then what I prefer and in comparison to some of the other Tasty Bite entries. I could see myself repurchasing this item, but mostly just to maintain a decent variety in my otherwise lacking 'lunch' habit. It's just not my favorite Tasty Bite."
3,"Excellent Product, Horrible Price","I ordered this a while ago and absolutely loved it. The spices are wonderful and the dish with rice and Naan bread make an excellent meal. However I recently discovered you can order directly from Tasty Bite and their 12-Pack is half the price. As you might have guessed, I will be ordering from them instead of amazon. I gave it 3 stars because of the price. If it were just about the product, it would be 5 stars."
2,"not what I expected, too sweet","I regularly order the Bharta Makhni at our favorite Indian restaurant and assumed this would be like that, No. This lacks the spice and proper seasoning. It ends up just being a rather disgustingly sweet variation on that dish. I will not be ordering it again."
3,"Taste ok, a bit too mushy","It tastes ok, a bit too mushy (can't make out the eggplant). Also beware of the high saturated fat (14-15%)."
5,A Very Interesting Documentary!,"A documentary that is very entertaining, humorous at times,and sexy ladies. If you've never been to a brothel, this is thenext best thing!"
3,Pittsburgh Penguins License Plate,"The license plate is OK. It will last, however a short time - it is a really thin plastic plate and mounted on front of my car will take a lot of abuse."
3,exquisite,"As with Shakespeare's literature, you must like the music of his time. If you are a newcomer to these toones, seat your self one afternoon in your studio, reading or painting or just vegetating. Play this CD and Let the musical notes take you where they will. Picture yourself at the Elizabethan courts, eat, dance and be merry. don't expect anything. just listen and enjoy.My humble opinion is that mankind, with all its arrogance and imperfections have created one single most PERFECT thing.... Music !"
4,Mya rocks!,"I bought this CD two weeks ago, and I thought it was weird that the had the lp version AND the edit. They are almost exactly this same. Anyway, it's one of my favorite songs. Mya is a strong person/performer who is herself and doesn't cover that. Cool."
5,A Drill Bit Sharpener That Really Works!,"I saw the Drill Doctor 250 demonstated at a show and when mine came in the mail, I didn't need the video to begin sharpening my piles of dull bits. It is easy and fast. For those that haven't had the advantage of a live demonstration, the free video covers all the bases. Old dull bits are as sharp as brand new in minutes. The unit is compact and well made in the USA.I am a professional woodworker and have an appreciation of well crafted tools. I wish the Drill Doctor could also sharpen my brad points. If they make one that will, I'll buy it as well.In the meantime, as a homeowner and woodworker that frequently puts conventional drills to severe use, I've no doubts that the Drill Doctor will save me time and money.Doug Stowe"
5,excellent,"I think the drill dr. 500 is one of the most useful tools ihave. i am so impressed i tell my own customers about how good it works.you dont throw away broken or burnt up bits, just resharpen them. i have an auto repair shop in FLA, so who knows they might want to by one."
4,Great Tool,This is a great tool for sharpening small to medium size drill bits. It really does work. Larger bits take take a while to sharpen and it does get tedious having to turn the bit while using the drill to spin the sharpening abrasive. It would have been cool if everthing was automatic but then look at the low price. Overall this is a great tool...you can have your old bit good as new in just 3-5 minutes.
3,"good drama, not my usual pick","This is a really good drama with excellent acting and filming for it's year. It's not my usual pick in dramas because I prefer to have a half comedic side to the show. But if you like something that is all drama then go for it. And the subbing is great, no complants in that area"
2,Kill to Love Review,I often got lost with this movie. It had some good moments and the music was good but there was alot of scenes that could have been edited out. What took eight disc could have been done in four. I liked the stars but even their work could not really save it. I am giving the movie a two mainly for the music
1,It's a VANITY BOOK !,"Not only did Mr. Litchfield write this book, but he published it himself ! IT'S A VANITY BOOK ! And after reading it, I asked for my money back. Too many angels and too much like a cult orientation handbook. He truely is a lawyer."
1,Poorly researched smug nonsense,"If you set out to dispel or debunk strongly held beliefs it helps to do your homework. There is already a considerable literature on fallacies and several thoroughly researched works in print. This particularly feeble effort is strewn with poor scholarship, repetition of old canards (the British inventing the concentration camp?-not so), and beliefs few educated people actually hold. Don't waste your money, get The Dictionary of Misinformation series."
3,thanks for letting us know...,"this is a pretty snazzy book-illustration wise. this book (written in 1957)describes ""evolution"" theory of how our universe came to be... this book describes,""tidal theory"" and the ""nebular theory"" of how our solar system began also. thenarrative continues with the earth forming...tiny one celled creatures...fishes...dinosaurs...huge creatures that were the forerunners of our modern animals....man...the ape-men and then ,regular man(homo sapiens-my favorite!)obviously,evolution discussion is not my forte! i try not to think about it too much-it boggles the mind-all the BILLIONS AND BILLIONS AND BILLIONS of years ittook for us to appear and then we created things ilke,cell phones and computers.aren't we great?!?!?"
4,A fascinating love story&#65533;.,"I truly loved the African royalty story and was truly inspired by the spiritual power of God that took place in this story. This is an excellent book for entertainment, not quite sure if it could be used for anything more than that. I for some reason question if the events really happen. However, I will brush up on the history of Queen of Sheba after reading this book. Interesting topic and makes you wonder. The Bible doesn't speak much of Queen of Sheba and Solomon however I'm very curious. I look forward to reading other stories by Ms. Dennie."
5,a fun read of an ancient biblical story,"Makeda, a 17 year-old princess, abruptly becomes the Queen of Sheba. Through a series of page-turning adventures she gives birth to Solomon's son, Menelik."
2,Not what it is supposed to be,"This book is fundamentally the same as the previous edition and has inherited its problems and idiosyncracies. Very annoying is its method (or lack of it). It flits from one thing to another. When you think you are going to get some information on a language point, you get a sentence (or short paragraph) and then the book jumps to something quite different. It doesn't get to grips with anything. You can't learn much. Another annoying feature, more so in this new edition, is the big gap between what you read on the cover and what you find in the book. You spend your money in the belief that you are buying a course that will help you progress quickly beyond the basics (that's what it says on the cover). Then you find out that the course barely covers the basics. I teach the language and have a copy of the book but this is a course I would not recommend."
2,It defies the basic rules of teaching,"Normally material is presented; then it is explained; finally the learner is tested. It is different in this course. In the dialogues of unit 1 and 2 you come across vai,vamos,vao plus infinitive. This verb construction is not explained in the grammar sections. But you are tested on it at the end of unit 2. You are expected to produce the answer 'Vou te dizer...' This defies the basic rules of teaching. This is not the only way this course defies normal teaching practice. Material is not graded. A new dialogue may introduce a number of new grammatical features at the same time, not step by step, and only some of these features will receive a (brief) explanation anyway. I would not call this a course. I would call it a random selection of dialogues and grammar notes."
2,Not the best option,"This course in not one of the best. It is very disorganised and the language is not quite right. It does not appear to like the brasilians either. Starting in the first lesson, it says that the portuguese language has an old fashioned way of saying thank you and that you have to watch the brasilian police. If you want a good course you have a choice in this collection. For just a taste of portuguese there is Elizabeth Smith's Instant Portuguese course. For more than a taste, you have Manuela Cook's course. The Instant Portuguese course is more for Europe, but Manuela Cook's is OK for Brasil too. It is very good and has a beginners section, like a preliminary section, a 'survival kit'.I am brasilian and have been asked my opinion by some friends from the States. When you are trying to learn a language often you don't really know what is the best course for you. It helps to have the opinion of a native speaker. Here it is my opinion, I hope it will help someone."
2,It takes you nowhere,"This course is too disorganized. It throws the language at you, jumps from one thing to another, you get nowhere. Nothing is properly coordinated. I much prefer The Living Language Portuguese, because it is more organized. You know where you are going, you feel you are getting somewhere."
2,Poorly Organized,"I did not have time to look through the small selection of Brazilian Portuguese grammar texts at the bookstore I bought this at, so I thought, usually the Teach Yourself books are pretty good (Italian and old French ones are great). I was thoroughly disappointed by this one however. The organization is terrible, grammar points are not thoroughly covered. It seems that only enough is explained to help you understand the specific conversation pieces throughout the text. This also was a pain, because over half the book is dedicated to conversations/dialogues that are helpful, yes, but very specific and the audio cassettes/cd's are basically essential here.Overall a poor investment. I'm looking for another grammar book and I just bought this a week ago."
2,Brazilian Portuguese but British English!,"This course is supposed to be for the Portuguese of Brazil as opposed to that of Portugal but the book is written in British English. This does not make much sense to me. It is for the Portuguese spoken in the American Continent but is written in the English used in Europe, why not in American English?Another problem I have with this course is its lack of logical organization. It jumps from one thing to another. As you go through the units you build up confusion instead of building up competence in the language. I gave up half way through!Not a favourite with me, you can tell. Sorry, but this is my experience of this course."
4,Good.,For my trip to Rio I used this book to help with saying basic phrases and understanding customs. It was very helpful.
2,"Some good info, but scattered with medical babble","I sold this one... Had some good info, but also more info from those who have no understanding of the words ""Natural Medicine.""If you want to know what the medical community is up to, and read thier propoganda about the natural health field, then it's a fair book to read, if you're loking for some really good alternative health information, you'd do much better to find an alternative source!"
3,PDR Family Guide,The printing is exceptionally small and hard to read. I expected more treatments that were common household items. Perhaps I was looking for something other than what I ordered.
2,Great idea but the one I got was poorly manufactured.,Yes I received my order today which included this 4516 model and a larger 4' x 4' model by the same company. I was very pleased with the large model. All the joints were tight and the edges were flush. But that was not the case with the 4516. There was nearly 1/16 inch play at the push button joint and one other joint was very loose also. I guess that rules out using it as a sawguide. I guess I will have to keep using my speed square even though it doesn't fold up.
5,Jack on the Streets of San Francisco in 1976,"The cover shows Jack playing on the streets of San Francisco back in the days of the Medicine Ball Band. The CD is divided into three sections. The first one has cuts from the ""Slow Boat to China"" record which also features Dave Marty and Braum Ver Der Meulen. The second section has songs from Jack's days playing at the Red Garter Club with the third section a collection of recordings from jam session. Jack is an outstanding banjo player and this CD is just part of his return to performing and he is working on a second CD for a later release. Jazz banjo magazine Oct 2002"
5,Best Madden yet?!?,"I don't get a Madden every year however, I think that this is the best one I have played so far. I especially like the changes from my last version, 03. The Franchise mode is much better and the nfl superstar is a lot of fun and seemingly very realistic."
1,Better On the Console,"(This review is for the PC version - I have played the game on PC, PS2 and XBox 360)I am disappointed in the PC version of this game. The customizability is nice (MP3 soundtrack, custom artwork, etc) but the gameplay is choppy and the controls, even with a dual strike, are not as fluid as the console. I don't think resources are a problem - I am running on an Athlon 64 with 1 GB of RAM and a Radeon x1600 card.Also with this game (like with everything now) you get this digital cockroach EALink app that wants to talk to the internet 24x7. You can turn it off, but outside of renaming the binary and then changing it back when you want to play online you can't get it to turn off and stay off.Anyway, stick with the console unless you and your friends like playing in a LAN league and you're really into customizing your team."
1,awesome at begining but gets boring,THis is a good game with the franchise and superstar hall of fame.But it sucks because nothing new happens its the same stuff game after game with the exceptional invisible gatorade being poured over the coaches head at the end of the superbowl.If YOUR WANTING TO BUY A GAME THAT WILL NOT GET OLD AFTER A FEW WEEKS OF PLAYING DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.
5,PC version is VERY good.,"From what I gather with most reviews,the xbox 360 version issubpar at best,and that's the version I really wanted. So I wentahead and got the PC version,and am VERY happy with it.It has allthe things you want,editable players/roster,John and Al,fast loadtimes,and the graphics are awesome (with enough cpu and video power).I'm running at 1600x1200,and all is bliss."
4,Classic Madden Game!,This is a great and fun game. It has pretty good graphics too. The only thing I don't like about it is that it doesn't work for ME and 2000 Computers. It only works for XP. Madden 08 works for both ME and 2000. Still a great classic NFL game!
1,Horrible quality,"These shoes began to fall apart on the 4th month of wear. ANother pair I bought a year ago have also now fallen apart.There is a reason they are trying to push it on sale for $25 so often. I've owned Walmart shoes that lasted longer than thesePure junk.And of course, Amazon only guarantees them for 30 days. Will never buy this brand again."
1,i'm afraid to put these guys on,i just got these shoes...should have listened to all the negative reviews. They look and feel really cheap. The color is a little off from what u see online (lighter and looking more like vinyl). I would recommend really thick socks as the meterial is rough around the edges and very stiff. tempted to return them but they were so cheap that i would not think it's worth the trouble.
5,Got compliments right away.,"Everyone at work compliments them and they think they are the Kenneth Cole reaction series. I just smile my and agree. At the price I will also be buying other colors. Size matched right up to my other shoes. They are to new to talk about durability, but all shoes get worn."
2,"Great at first, but now disappointed","I guess I can't complain too much, I got these shoes for $25. They are really almost my most comfortable shoes ever. But after a couple of months wearing them semi regularly, the inside heel of my left shoe has fallen apart. I lifted up the insole and other material, and found the supports in the sole have just disintegrated. That sucks. Hopefully more luck next time."
5,GOOD BUY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"THESE SHOES ARE VERY NICE TO WEAR....SO MUCH SO, THAT I PURCHASED ANOTHER PAIR. THEY LOOK GOOD AND ARE GREAT QUALITY TOO. MUCH BETTER THAN ROCKPORTS AND OTHER HIGHER PRICED SHOE BRANDS. THE SIZES RUN TRUE TO FIT....GET A PAIR AND YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT!!!!!!!!"
4,Horses a Plenty,"a good pictorial reference with a lot of info for collector's...alas, no price values though....but great for researching names and dates of production."
1,just junk,this tool just sat on the shelf until yesterday when i started woodworking again. This tool is now just a pile of junk that I can not find paper for. If it was any bigger I would use it for an anchor. well dremel you have lost another customer. there are other companies that make your same tools or if not I will find another way to do the job. If I could have given it no stars I would have. Anyway I give dremel no stars.
1,Complaint,I purchased a Dremel Contour Sander a while back and I have just used for the first time it and it quit. I understand now why so many Companies have quit carrying it.
4,good product,"After 3 months of trying to find this,finaly got one. Why they quit making this sander is beyond me. It does so many things in hard to reach places. I make Diamond Willow walking sticks and it does a great job in sanding the Diamonds smooth, making for a great looking stick."
4,Pretty good tool,"This tool is pretty good for what I used it for. I am sanding a bannister. The small attachments didn't work for me, but the larger base did and for such a small tool, it is pretty powerful. I had to reglue the velcro to the base because it came off within a few days of using the sander but other then that, It's worth the money."
2,Do not buy,"I was delighted to find this tool and thought it would be just the solution for my projects. But like other reviewers, I was very disappointed. Just out of warranty, it died, even though it had not had many hours of use. I paid $80 at Lowe's a couple of years ago and spent a good deal more on accessories and the expensive proprietary sand paper it requires. So now I have a lot of money sitting in a little black bag. It might last for some simple, occasional hobby activities, but it is quite expensive for that. It won't hold up for more serious projects. In the end, the lesson was the same as for many gadgets: the old fashioned way still works the best. Good quality sandpaper and a little creativity in shaping it make more sense for me."
1,It died after minor use!,"After sanding details over a period of two years for about a total of only 12 hours, it up and died yesterday when I used it. out of warranty now for sure, it only got used a little. how much use did it get? I still have most of the original sanding tubes and pads. I switched the brushes - nope.Meantime, my rotary dremel tool has been through the wringer and is still great."
1,Not one of Dremels better tools,I have used Dremel brand dremel tools for years and get good value for the money. However I classify this sander as a purchasing mistake. Here is why; 1) I get a lot of scratching on the items I sand. 2) It does not remove much material and takes a long time to do the job. 3) The sanding pads tend to fall off. 4) It died on me after about 5 hours of use. I wouldn't pay to fix it. I will try my next detail sander before I buy.
2,less than impressive...,"I got this sander to get into tiny places that my orbital sander couldn't touch or was too powerful for, as well as contoured pieces, particularly rounded edges. For me, it's weak, even for a detail sander. Takes a long time and doesn't really smooth pieces to my liking, so I end up touching it up by hand. I've found that it's just as fast to do those small areas completely with hand sanding if you have a good, flexible sanding pad. It's very weak on cleaning up glue lines and spots as well--just lacks the power. The concept is good, but the performance is weak. If you want to invest in a detail sander, I would suggest that you go for one with considerably more power."
2,Worked excellent for two days,I got this tool to sand kitchen cabinet doors. It worked execellent for 2 days. The sanding contours worked great to sand curves and grooves. But by the third day the tool would no longer hold the sanding contours. At max speed they continued to pop out. I returned the unit and I'm currently looking for another tool. This Dremel is not up to a serious job.
3,A how-to guide for living aboard an ocean cruising boat.,"An interesting, easy to read guide for sailors or powerboaters who anticipate spending a lot of time aboard their boat while cruising the oceans and visiting the world's exotic seaports. This book includes all the little things we seem to forget when planning a vacation. Everything is covered, from galleys to heads, menus to medicine, and routine maintenance to emergencies. The author speaks from her vast personal experiences to help you prepare for your own ocean adventure. Although biased towards sailors, this book is useful for sail and power alike"
5,One of the most usefull tools in my shop,"This purchase was my first Dremel tool. I've used it to sand, grind, cut and fabricate small pieces or to modify larger pieces. You can do almost anything with one of these things. And with all of the new attachments they are coming out with....it just gets better....buy one...seriously... you wont regret it."
4,FF: Dawn of Souls,The product was exactly as expected. Nothing really needed cleaned or fixed. We have no issues with the item at all. Thanks!
4,Good re-release,"Largely as I remember the originals, but you don't have to fight the console like you did with the original NES."
4,"Great intro to Final Fantasy, but a bit frustrating at times","I had never really played Final Fantasy before, and my husband gave me this game to get started. (So many of my friends are into FF that I had to give in and try it.) Overall, it really is a great game and easy to play. The item and character stats are straightforward, as are the combat mechanics and character interaction. I have loved it, but I have to admit it the sheer size of the world can be a bit overwhelming. At times it can be difficult to figure out what to do next and how to get where you need to go. The graphics are primitive by today's standards, but that's part of its charm. All in all, I think it's an excellent fit for the GBA Advance. Just check out an online guide if you get stuck or confused."
5,Actually...,"(...)FF2 as Americans know it as actually FF4 (its in finaly fantasy chronicles). It tells the story of Cecil. It also has the twin mages, Kain the dragoon, Golbez etc.the FF2 in this is the realy FF2, the on released in Japan. It's first appearence in the US was in Final Fantasy Origins, which is similar to this, but does not have the extra dungeonsI hope that clears up the confusion"
5,AWESOME REMAKE!!!,LOVED THIS REMAKE OF FINAL FANTASY 1 AND 2. THE SOULS OF CHAOS ADDITION WAS REALLY COOL! MORE WEAPONS WAS EXCITING AND MORE BOSSES! GRAPHICS WERE PRETTY IMPRESSIVE. IF YOU ARE A HARDCORE FINAL FANTASY FAN YOU SHOULD DEFINATELY ADD THIS ONE TO YOUR COLLECTION.
1,plz read,i cannot beleive the credit people are giving this game. No offence to the NES but i would rather play other games. Some one gave my friend the game for his little brother who i had just bought his advance from so he gave the game to me. I would never spend money on this game. I suggest final fantasy XII for the PS2 or boktai for the gba.
4,It's a nostalgia game,"Just Nostalgia, I bought it since I remembered it as a great game, and in fact it was a great game, but it is not now."
5,"""Krispos"" is a delightfully engrossing story!","This was the first book by Turtledove that I read, and it's still my favorite. The story follows the life of the remarkable character ""Krispos"", from childhood to young adulthood. His great adventures are chronicalled with marvelous detail. Never have I read a book with a more detailed fantasy world than this. I was enthralled from the first page!"
3,Comprehensive Guide for Building Student,"This book comprises everything from A to Z. It provide students even professional builders a quick recall/review of construction environment associated terms, elements and functions. Although, most of the subjects are mentioned and provided necessary example and explaination, there are only can be treated as a guildline. If anyone who wanted for a more detailed explanation and case study, this may not be the one. Since the building industry is so complex and varies all the time, this books can provide a good management basic for all reletated discipline."
5,A Valuable Book,"I am about two thirds of the way through this book, and it is one of the best I have read about Vietnam. Although I have read a lot of books about the war, this is the first one I've seen which is written by a Loach (LOH)pilot. It seems like most of the books I have read about choppers are about Hueys, LRRP pilots or gunships and I never really had a good understanding about what the Loaches experienced. This book really filled a gap in my knowledge, and it is very well written."
5,Thanks Again Colonel Mills,"In 1969 I lost a close friend to the Viet Nam war and when I went to Jim Slater's funeral I thought maybe his wife or family could tell me how it happened. They didn't know any more than I. Some years later my brother called me and said ""If you want to know what happened to Jim go buy Low Level Hell by Hugh Mills and by the way you won't be able to put it down 'til you find the back cover.""So again many thanks to Colonel Mills for this vivid chronicle of their experience and Jim's last ride. Now we know."
4,Very interesting,"Never had read anything about the dangerous job that this part of the military does. Hugh Chandler was quite the hero, as well as everyone that does his type of career. He was a dear friend of my husband's and played a very important role in bringinghome all of our heroes. Thank you Hugh. Darlene Milloy"
2,Very little content.,"The book is action packed but it ends there. You can literally go to any spot in the book and read 5 pages and the content would be nearly the same as any other 5 pages. The action is very well described but becomes very repetitous and therefore, ""Boring"". after reading 75% I found myself speeding through the remainder just to get it over with.Needs more character build-up and a lot more intimate details."
3,OK. A bit much. Just OK.,"I was also a helo pilot in the very area the author writes about. His book is ... condensed realism. In reality, the air war over III Corps was hours and hours of boredom puncuated by seconds of terror. Of course writing a book that is 95% boring would never sell.My recommendation: Read Chickenhawk. More realistic and MUCH more entertaining."
3,Inspiring but too slow,"The author employs fascinating dialogue with great insight to characters and their spiritual journey. Unfortunately that did not start until after about 190 pages into the novel. This is a slow developing novel with too many sub-plots and problems with character development.I can only recommend this book because of the great insights this author provided within the novel. There are small gems scattered throughout the last half of the book.O'Brien's book Fr. Elijah is still one of my all time favorite books, so maybe I am setting the bar too high."
4,a tale of family struggle,"In some ways I loved this book.Unlike many books depicting the struggles of poverty, we don't see caricatures of dumb people or religious fanatics, or a one layer tale told by someone who either romanticizes or despises poor rural people. Instead, we find a tapestry of real personalities who have depth and complexities in their simple lives.That said, like many of O'Brien's books, the tales are episodic and don't quite hold together. O'Brien uses simple tales to discuss deeper ideas in his books. His characters are vivid and real, however, and stay in your mind as ""friends"" far after you finish the book (one way that I judge if a book is great, even when I find the initial reading of a book difficult).Finally, as a family tale, it has few of the apocolyptic themes of O'Brien's later books. Those seeking ""end of time"" themes will be disappointed. Those seeking rich characters will find what they seek."
5,An excellent portrayal of love and marriage,"Michael O'Brien's books are profoundly insightful. They demonstrate the lack of spiritual depth in our society and the desperate need we have to recover that depth. ""Strangers and Soujourners"" is a marvelous, gradual unfolding of the real meaning of marriage and commitment. The book is somewhat difficult to ""get into"" but if the reader sticks it out, he will be richly rewarded. O'Brien demonstrates a profound insight into the need for our society to recover a sense of faith, love and family."
4,The Twists and Turns of Life (Strangers and Sojourners),"As one goes through life they have many challenges, physically and mentally. This is a classic Micheal O'Brien in that it is highly descriptive and detailed of the various moments of activity and periods of time that relate those challenges of the characters in this story. While it is sometimes a bit tedious I found that justified in the end having wound through the intricacies of the relationships. It is amazing in the weaving of the plot and the ability to tell it in such minute detail without redundancy. If you like Micheal O'Brien you will like this book. If you are trying him for first time you will be back."
3,"great themes, ponderous writing","I was thrilled with O'Brien's Father Elijah, and rushed to buy this book. In it I was disappointed at the practically sophmoric imagery he uses to describe every scene. His overuse of lush metaphor reads like a bad romance novel, and one suspects this is aimed at such readers. If you found the abysmal Bridges of Madison County to be good writing, you will find this to your liking. What rescues this book from ""one star"" is his theme of spiritual redemption. But Michael, please! Reclaim your ability to write decent prose. The sappines of this one was onerous."
3,A semi soap opera/ diary type story line.,"I really enjoyed Father Elijha and wanted to devour anything else O'Brien wrote but found Strangers and Sojourners lacking. After completing the book I wondered if the next book in the sequel would be worth my time. There were many points in the book I really liked and could relate to in my life. However, the book in whole did not inspire me.....much."
2,Too slow for me,"I read and loved Father Elijah, Plague Journal and Eclipse of the Sun. They were wonderful, faith-filled, and action-packed Catholic novels. Then I bought Strangers and Sojourners, hoping to continue the action. It started out with a bang, at a satanic ceremony in the main character's childhood. I thought that it would continue from there with more God versus Satan action. No such luck. The story is very slow and just didn't hold my interest. Twice I took breaks to read more interesting novels before continuing with Strangers and Sojourners, then I finally just gave up. I was over 200 pages into the book and still there was very little happening in the woman;s faith and not much action to speak of. It was just too boring for me. I was disappointed with this novel."
3,"Actually, 3 1/2 stars would be more appropriate. . .","I just finished ""Strangers and Sojourners"". I enjoyed the book; indeed, I found it profoundly moving at numerous points. The spiritual depth was extremely insightful. O'Brien is a masterful storyteller. However, for many, the flaws in this book would be difficult to overcome. I found the prose overly florid much of the time. I found some of the characterizations weak (or at least, unbelievable). I thought that the storyline dragged at bit at times. But overall, I considered my reading as time well spent.One thing that O'Brien does very well, however, is to issue a clarion call against the decay in modern society. I'm not sure that I completly buy into his eschatology, but I certainly agree with his characterization of modernity.An inspiring, but not brilliant book."
4,Perfect fit.,wow Vance and Hines have done it with these pipes!!Fit my 2007 Vstar 650 Custom perfect...Sounds great loud but not to loud...
3,"Okay, but not a star","I purchased this saw to replace a Benchtop brand that I had. The saw assembled easily and the powerful motor was impressive. I also liked the 60 degree miter to the right. I was disappointed with the poor vise clamp and no standard extension wings. The saw had too much plastic and felt a little cheap. My bottom line is this, Hitachi makes very good power tools but this is not one of their best. It is okay but no better than my Benchtop especially when you consider that you are paying twice the price for a similar tool, both made in Taiwan, with the cheaper one having more accessories and just as durable.. Well, that is my opinion. The saw is okay but not five star or american quality. Amazon did have the best price around on the saw, bar none."
4,Fast and easy,"Seeds arrived even before expected.Lowest price anywhere. I am glad I ordered two packages because the seeds are extremely small, and only about 1/2 will germinate. I will see how many plants I actually get in a few months."
1,Terrible,"These changing pads are TERRIBLE. I washed them before my baby came home and not only did they ball up and end up looking like they were 10 years old (they were brand new), their fuzz balls stuck on everything else I washed them with. So there I sat, with a lint brush, trying to salvage the laundry. They are 100% not worth the annoyance. Buy another brand and save yourself the hassle. I would give this product zero stars, but apparently you are forced to assign at least one."
1,disapointing,I was very disapointed. I washed before using it and that was it. Could not use anymore. I used baby detergent and tunble dry in a low setting. Don't buy it. it's a waste of money
3,Don't hold up well after washing,"I bought a bunch of these and they serve their purpose but even without having ever put them in the dryer, they pill very easily."
2,Falling apart already!!,"These pads were a deal that was too good to be true. Compared to other pads they were a good deal for 3. After using them for less than 7 weeks, they are already falling apart. Balled up on 1st wash. Plastic inside ripped on 1. Only washed a couple times a week!! If you hand wash and hang to dry they might be okay. Would NOT buy again. Ordering more of the expensive ""name brand"" pads!!!"
4,Good but not soft,"Pros:The size is very good. I use it underneath both my baby and toddler for a changing mat.It folds up nicely to fit in diaper bag.Works as intended.Cons:NOT SOFT. It's wool... a bit scratchy.I accidentally put one in the dryer and it formed pills all over the surface. So definitely hang it dry!Overall, they are good and sturdy. I expect it should last a few years. I would recommend."
5,Like it,It fits very easily as they say. I did drop my camera once from an 18in high coffee table and nothing happened to the lens. It's been very useful so far.
4,Great filter,This is the filter that I use on my lenses when I am not using the polarizer in order to protect them. Very useful to cut through the haze on hot days. Highly recommended.
2,Better than Tiffen but still gives flare,"Shoot professionally, frequently in low light conditions or darn close to dark. At a recent company Christmas Party this filter gave me lots of shots with some flare. Looking to get Pro1 version to hopefully solve this issue. The HMC 67mm on a Tamron 17-50 DI lens did Not give flare under identical circumstances. Will try to upload picture(s) of flare."
2,HOYA 58mm UV(C) not UV-0,"This item is not labeled correctly. I ordered this item hoping it would be a UV-0, which I know is in part my fault. However, it would have saved me money and time if it were labeled correctly. It is actually Hoya HMC UV(C). This piece of glass has way worse flaring that another filter I purchased for a few bucks more. Check images for my comparison.The worst part of this filter is it got stuck on my 300+ dollar lens and I freaked out because it wasn't budging. I was finally able to get it off without breaking my lens.The other bad thing about it is the lens cover cap doesn't clip in all the way, like a previous review mentioned. I didn't think it was a big deal until I saw what it was like in person. See images to see what I mean.All in all I would rather just fork out the extra money and get the same filter I already have or try and find a UV-0 like I was hoping this was."
4,Beware of Glare and Flare,"I trust Hoya brand, but even though this filter says it is multi-coated, one of those coats is not anti-glare. Make sure you have a circular polarizer handy. Otherwise, you may run into glare and flare spots with your photos.I live in Seattle, so it is difficult to tell when cloudy days receive the gift of sunlight here and there. After a strenuous uphill hike to the top of a spectacular view, being without a polarizer, several amazing pictures had glare and flare spots due to the sun peaking out. Total bummer.In summary, I don't have much experience with filters (yet), so maybe this is commonly known with UV filters that are not labeled as pro, or it is a known fact in general. I gave this product 4 stars due to the ambiguity of the multi-coated claim; it is definitely not anti-glare. Take it for literal value (UV coated only).On the bright side (no pun intended), the lens cap for my Canon EOS 500D (Rebel T1i) fits nicely."
4,Serves its purpose,"Used it on my hike through the Enchantments to protect my lens from the elements. Pictures came out great (except for a bit of flare on one or two), but rain spots were a little too obvious on some (more so than a regular lens). Construction seems good and durable, but not amazing - but that's about what you expect for the price of this item. Overall, I'm happy with it."
4,Happy with purchase and service,"Purchased the Hoya 58mm UV (Ultra Violet) Multi Coated Glass Filter. Glass being the key word. I'm not a professional photographer, but have spent a lot of money on a good quality camera and I think it makes sense to spend just a little more to get a reasonable filter. The service was fantastic and I found the company I purchased from extremely helpful."
5,great product,this is a fantastic alternative to more expensive products.... i purchased 2 of these for my lenses and they are crystal clear.. coating is good the only thing i think could be a little better could be anti fog . also all my products thread into the filter... these are an exceptional value and would recommend this product to anyone looking
3,"Good filter, but tends to create flares at night",I have been using Hoya and TIffen UV filters for a number of my lenses. They typically do a good job during the day but create ghost lights when used at night. My Tiffen filters are actually more prone to flaring than my Hoya (I would five an extra 1/2 start to Hoya). Ultimately the best option for night photography is to remove the filter. It is night and day in terms of result (pun intended).
3,Protects but sometimes ghost.,I purchased this because I wanted to protect my len because I will have it out a lot without the lens cap on all the time. It is nicely made but it is far from perfect. The lens cap itself doesn't go all the way on and there's a small gap between the lens cap and filter. It stays on but I am worried that it may fall off. Another thing is that it will ghost on you if you shoot at a light bulb or any sort of light source like that. Overall it is decent for the money for DSLR lens because of the built quality but beware of the ghosting.
3,Almost as expected but one thing....,Product does it's job. The only thing that was disappointed with is that the canon lense cap tends to fall off easily when used with this filter. Sort of annoying. They need to work on that!!!
2,The last HOYA filter I purchased,"I have been using HOYA filters for years, but no more. I purchased this filter in May 2012 to protect Canon kit lens on a Canon DSLR. In July the filter cracked, while in protective camera bag with lens cap on. This is the second HOYA filter that died on me like this within a year. Yes, camera bag must have been bumped into something, but the impact has been nothing out of ordinary--nobody dropped the bag. I blame my last HOYA filter's early demise on the design flaw common to all HOYA filters I have purchased. Unlike the B&W filter I purchased as replacement (ASIN: B0000BZL67), the metal frame of the HOYA has no inner metal ring for the lens cap to stand on, so that any impact on the lens cap, however mild, impacts the glass directly. The reportedly better optical characteristics of the B&W are a welcome bonus."
1,Multicoated but the glass had rough defects...,"Cleaned lens filters for installation and found each had a hard grain of glass or sand or something embedded in the p,ane of the filter glass.... Hoya... What happened to quality checks After you moved to phillipines...."
3,A must have,"Fine. Easy to use and easy to put on the camera. Once it is on, you don't know it is there but if I ever dropped the camera or damaged the lens, I know I would know it was not there, which was the point of the purchase."
3,Fast Delivery,Arrived well within the time frame. Looks OK. Little tricky to fix. Does not stay fit. Results are not bad. Base line is you get what you paid for.
1,"Just a piece of glass, too much glare","I bought this filter because of the high rate in amazon. However, when I receive it, I found it is not multilayer coated (you can judge it from the reflective light). I had a tiffen uv filter and there are ghost images on my picture, so I got this one expecting to get rid of it. But the result really disappoint me..."
3,Worth it?,"Pros: Protects LensCons: Only 1 function, PriceReview: I think I got hosed, I don't think that an extra expensive HMC UV filter can be that different from cheap ones. Erring on the side of caution, you can expect that it doesn't add any color cast, or vignetting, but com'on, its a piece of glass.Rationalization: Tell yourself that Canon/Nikon/Zeiss etc. would only choose the highest quality UV filter, and if you already spent 300+ dollars on a lens, why risk messing up the IQ or the lens itself? Penny wise, pound foolish? - seriously though, is 50 dollars reasonable for a round piece of glass? I don't think so, but I'm not willing to learn the hard way."
5,Outstanding quality both product and seller,"The filter arrived in perfect condition and right on time as advertised. It will more than adequately fulfill my needs. As far as Gigabargain goes, I can't say enough good about them. I had several shipping issues related to my personal situation. Gigabargain bent over backwards to try and get the filter to me. They were very helpful and understanding. Thank you."
3,DOA,"My filter came with a large bubble in the glass near the edge. Fortunately, it is outside the visible range of my lens."
3,"Saw should be better than this for a ""name brand"".","First off, it appears the Amazon advertisement is misleading. The ad leads you to believe the saw comes with two 4 inch blades (includes 4-inch continious rim diamond blade, 4-inch turbo-style diamond blade, and plastic case). My saw came with the plastic case and only one diamond blade. The saw has other problems that should not be present on a saw in this price range (bottom metal plate is thin sheet metal, easily deflects to change cutting angle----during the first use the plastic water hose came loose from the garden hose fitting due to no hose barbs on the brass fitting---the plastic fitting around the saw blade looks very cheap and held in place with a thin bracket).MK Diamond 157461 MK-70 8.75 Amp 4-Inch Hand-Held Tile and Masonry Saw"
3,good but thick line,its a good line but i use it as a leader with hooks attached to it instead of using it directly on the spool of the reelthe line is not really round and rather flattened which makes it terrible for castingGet it as a leader for another thinner line if you want but dont get it to spool it directly in your reel unless you dont want to cast long distance
5,The Last Day of Summer,"This is a really fun family movie. I especially liked the character ""MEAT"" played by Daniel Samonas! I am sure we will be seeing more of him in the future..."
4,Great shoot-em-up action,"Bio-Hazard Battle is a side scrolling shooter with good graphics and a terrific funky/weird soundtrack. Instead of the lone spaceship vs alien horde theme of most shooters, however, you control a ship that looks like an insect (you can select one of four different species). Your enemies look like giant mutant insect creatures too: everthing from mosquitos to worms to grasshoppers to killer bees, though they look half-alien too. Just think of a side-scrolling shooter like Darius or R-Type where the spaceships have been replaced by freaky insect-things. Along the way you can collect power-ups and decide what style of offensive weapon you want to use. You can also team-up with someone as this game can be played 1 or 2-player.If you're a Genesis fan and like a good shooter, get this."
2,It was great --- once !,Bottom line. Lots of good info but much of it is way out of date. It's past time for an rewrite.
2,Not for complete idiots,"I have a Ph.D. in philosophy but could not follow the descriptions in this book of how to use a compass and topo maps in conjunction with a GPS. I also was as confused after I finished reading the book as before I started about such questions as how to find something in a forest when the satellite connection doesn't work. On the other hand, the book does give a decent introduction to the sport and general procedures of geocaching."
4,"A must have for the geocaching ""newbie"".","Everyone who plans to launch the geocaching hobby needs this book. It's tempting to grab your new GPS out of the box and wing it, but without this guide you will be missing out on the many features of your unit."
2,The Complete Idiot's Guide to Geocaching,"I felt duped. I knew it was used, but I did not know it was old, 6 years old. Statistics were not current. I would not have been interested in this book had I been aware that it was that old. It may have been a ""complete"" guide when it was written, but it certainly is not today."
3,Just fine...,After 2 months my son only plays with the torpedoes. The submarine is a little to big and the launching of the torpedoes is not very impressive. But he has a blast playing with the torpedoes....
3,OK,"The book had spunky characters and good friendships, along with an interesting, though not particulary compelling or thought-provoking or stunning, plot. One of those tolerable books, it won't keep you on the edge of your seat, but it's not so boring that it'll make your head bleed either."
2,Genghis Kahn II,"Might've helped if it had some instructions. At this point I'll stick with ""Liberty or Death""."
1,Pond Pellets,I found this product useless for controlling algae in my small fish pond and it thoroughly makes a mess in your pond when it dissolves in the water.
4,The bad and the good,"Upon removing the unit from its shipping box, I noticed a rattling sound inside. I opened the case and found one of the four motor/fan housing mounting bolts was completely out of its fixture and one of the remaining three was loose. The one totally out was of course the least accessible so I had to take the whole case apart, put the bolt back in place and reassemble the unit making sure all the other fasteners were tight along the way. (It took about 25 minutes start to finish). I then mounted the unit on the ceiling of my workshop and began using it. It cleans the air like a champ. I don't know what noise scale the other reviewers are using, but my unit makes less noise than I expected.Oh by the way, I called JDS and complained about the loose bolt problem; they apologized and promptly sent me a free charcoal filter as compensation for my troubles. I will have no problems dealing with JDS in the future."
5,My second one!,"I recently expanded my shop to 30 X 30 so I purchased a 2nd unit for the new space. The unit is quiet and moves alot of air. I no longer have that fine dust that settles over everything the next day.My first unit is still running strong after over 3 years of use and two falls! I might suggest getting a friend to help hoisting it to the ceiling... I thought it was hosed for sure the first time the unit and I tumbled off the ladder. It was a little bent up but that was fixed easy enough. The remote is line of sight but works very well anywhere in my shop.I compared the noise level to my friends Delta. although I'm not an audiophile, the sound level was acceptable to me. The unit shipped ahead of schedule and came in good shape. It included all the necessary hardware to ceiling mount it."
5,Air cleaner,The product was promptly delivered and was in excellent condition when I opened the box. Installation is a snap (I chose the ceiling mount) and the thing does exactly what it says it will. My shop is cleaner and I hope my lungs are as well! I did a lot of research on other air cleaners before I chose the JDS and I am extremely happy!!
5,Sucks great,I have the earlier model without the remote but works great. Put a wall timer in and works great.
1,Poor Quality Control,"Unit arrived without instructions or warranty. Also missing were the pull chain, rubber feet, and speed control knob. Fan was so poorly aligned in the housing that friction kept it from running. POOR, POOR, POOR quality control."
1,"Good product,, poor packaging. 4 stars.","I am a C.ENGINEER myself. I like the product. It is an excellent air system,but it could use a better packaging. I called the JDS customer service the same day. The item came in with a big dent at the corner. JDS could use a bit morepackaging on their item. The wooden support was great, but the top had no support. I figure I had an American product I talk to them myself before I send it back to Amazon.com, I pulled up the big dent,but the filter came up crooket,or not straight. I contacted JDS. They call me back right away, I thought they will mail it back to me. I haven't received the the replacement filter yet. I may have to buy the filter on amazon.com. They could get 5 star if not the damage filter. I will strongly recomend this product."
4,Good support if there is a problem!,"When we first received this item, the motor wouldn't turn because the ""cage"" was dragging on the side of the blower housing. After disassembly, it was discovered that the cage is unsquare to the axle, and it wobbles about 3/8 - 1/2"" from one side to another. I repositioned the cage on the shaft, and the unit runs good with some vibration. It is unknown whether this was a factory defect, or if it was damaged during shipping. I contacted JDS and they sent a new, balanced cage & an extra filter without any problems. Summary: You won't get stuck with a ""lemon"" with the JDS, so I'd recommend it for purchase."
4,Works well for me,"I bought this JDS air filter several years ago. I have been pleased with it except for one small thing. The receiver for the remote is on the opposite side from I need it, and often does not reliable receive the signal from the remote. Since I have a metal garage door, I've discovered I can usually bounce the signal off the metal door and get it to work. If the batteries in the remote are low, it it often won't work. Replacing the batteries alleviates the problem.If JDS would put the receiver on the bottom, I think it might fix this problem. I've considered mounting a small mirror slightly below the bottom on the receiver side in a position that allows angling it to reflect the signal a little better than the garage door."
5,"Good product, great price","I installed the JDS 750-ER a week ago and have been pleased with it's performance thus far though I have not yet had a sanding intensive project to test it with. The construction is sturdy and the timer and remote function well, and it is quieter than I expected, even on high. The only gotcha I found in installing it was the fact that there is a styrofoam packing block wedged in the fan motor to keep it from rotating during shipping, the note of which is buried in the manual text instead of being mentioned first thing. If they put a separate sheet of paper or highlighted boxed text in the manual it would be more obvious. I turned mine on and it would not blow so immediately turned it off and took the filters off to discover the packing block. I'm sure some folks have burned out their fan motors because of this. Other than that, I'm happy with the purchase."
2,Very noisy,"Although the product description says ""whisper quiet"", this thing makes a racket. Even on the lowest speed it is very noisy. On high it is intolerable. While it filters the air as advertised it makes so much noise that there was no way I could use it. I returned it and got the Jet AFS-1000B. While the Jet is not silent, it's a whole lot better.I did some testing with a sound level meter and got the following results. The meter was set up four feet from the unit.JDS LO - 72db, MED - 77db, HI - 81dbJET LO - 56db, MED - 71db, HI - 76dbBoth units seem to filter well and appear well made. The JDS has a better remote while I think the Jet has a better filter arrangement. Before you buy, make sure you have a chance to listen to these things. An air filtration system is no good if you won't turn it on because of the noise."
4,Good overall design and quality,"Pros... The unit is designed and constructed reasonable well, quality seems good so far. It makes a little more noise than I expected, based on the other review, but it isn't unreasonably loud. The remote and timer are great.Cons... The unit sports an ""electrostatic air filter"" Now, when I hear that, I expect to find a high voltage power supply with an ion charged attraction surface (like my whole house filter installed in my central forced hot air heating system). However, what is in this unit is a plastic 1"" thick filter that can be washed and reused. That washable filter is a good feature, but I think that it is misleading to label it as electrostatic. I'm sure that technically it has electrostatic feature, but certainly not what I expected.I'm going to keep the unit as I believe it will meet my needs and like I said the design is well thought out and the fabrication quality is good."
2,Expect damage in shipping.,"The case is too weak for shipping. The shipping industry is too brutal for this product. The packaging around the air cleaner isn't up to the task. I sent two of these back due to damage and use a face filter instead. It would have been nice to run an air cleaner in the shop, but it won't be a JDS"
5,Worth every cent,"I looked long and hard checked out all of the other units the JDS 750-ER blew them away. I have health problems and the wood dust really tears me up. I have been remodeling my shop so I have been doing my scrolling in a spare bedroom all I was getting done was running the shop vac and fans out the windows I did not want my wife to tell me to get it out so I have been very careful. The JDS 750 is about half as loud on high as a 20"" box fan on med. It does not only get 99% of air born dust in the room it does the whole house My wife has noticed the diffrence in the entire house. I have no dought when it goes back in the 25'x20'x10' shop it will do as well Do not fool with the others I have friends with Deltas not even close to the JDS. I hope my wife lets me take it out to my shop. It had a dent in the top of it from shipping but it is so good I still give it 5 stars. I will give SMASH X shipping 1 star."
4,Canto: ragtime to contperary to classical chanber,"Even though the Amazon listing of artists places Israeli cellist Ms. Michal Schmidt first, pianist Dr. Esther Wang is on all tracks either as accompanyist or soloist. Violinst Katie Lansdale is on four tracks. Dr. Wang is featured on five tracks.Cellist Schmidt is featured on one track. Music styles are wide-ranging, but the performances are outstanding."
3,dated info,I thought it was a newer book and am disappointed even though it was it was recommended to me.
4,Interesting,This book is interesting. It gives you an array of suggestions broken down by topic. It covers your entire family and pets. There are notes from doctors covering the suggestions on the topics and I thought it got out of hand a bit there. But it gives you something to think about and go from there.
5,Better than a Drug !!!!!!!,Love the book on Home Remedies !!!!! Given the option of a Home Remedy or popping a pill?? I'll take the home remedy first!!!! Turn to the book ALOT !!!!! GREAT!!!!!!!
3,"Good concept, TERRIBLE SAVE SYSTEM!","Kill.Switch has a great gimmick, your character, displayed in 3rd person view, has to hide behind objects and blindly shoot over them effectively in order to advance in the game. At times, players can switch to first person view, looking down the sight of one of the available weapons in the game. I started playing this game this week and I am pretty hooked on it.The game has alot going for it. Graphically, Kill.Swith looks really good. The game levels are designed fairly well, the game has a sniper mode (always a plus for me), the enemy AI is OK; the only problem is Kill.Switch's in-game save system.AGAIN with the ""Save Checkpoint"" save system?! This was coded just to make a short game longer. I spent a couple of hours on one level, which got boring after the 10th time around, simply due to the fact that I could not save my progress during the game. Note to ALL game developers: Players now ALWAYS need the ability to save anywhere."
1,STAY AWAY. The game DOESN'T WORK,"Wasted money. Trying to return to the store.Game doesn't start. It checks for copyright protection (after installation), hangs and display the error that it doesnt recognise the disk. WTF?Namco (publisher) point finger to Hip games (developer) who doesn't answer nor it offers and fix patch.STAY AWAY people. What good is the game if it doen't work!"
5,It made my Dad's day!,"My Father had been searching for awhile for this CD. When I finally found it on Amazon, he was so happy! He listens to it every day."
1,Don't waste your money,"I did not notice any significant desensitizing from this product. Prescription PreviDent5000 from the dentist for about $20 placed in your trays and worn definitely does the trick, at least it did the trick for me."
4,Very good introduction to Renaissance music,"One of the only books on Renaissance music (with the one of Perkins I think). Both, history and music analysis are treated, with multiple musical examples; it's a very good introduction to that music.Still it lacks some aesthetics points concerning the real musical practice (but, that's not easy...).Also, you really shall buy the anthology with the book, cause there are many examples to refer. And you'll have them both for... a 100 $, cheap... A CD would be appreciable (cause when it becomes complex polyphony, you should be a good sight-reader)."
5,The Best of them all,"This documentary describes Joe Louis as the champion who knew the art and science of boxing. It also shows how loyal and dedicated he was to his country. He donated some of his earnings or purses to the Armed Forces of the United States. He became a role model for America,and would travel the world over in which he gave boxing exhibitions free of charge. The story shows how quickly he gave and never wished for in return,but years later when he fell upon troubled times the US Government betrayed him but later relented. Very interesting story. I recommend it for many to see."
2,Joe Louis : American Hero Betrayed,"Joe Louis was before my time but always been a big fan of his ..Was disappointed in this DVD ..Didn't tellme anything I didn't already know.HBO, producer didn't do their homework..Left out how the war started betweenbetween Joe and IRS - USO benefit fight..The original film clips were entertaining but that was about it..HBO should get another producer and do a remake ..HBO missed the boat on this one..."
2,Interesting but not orthodox,Dr. Errico's comments are interesting and could be enlightening but the reader should know his interpretation of the meaning of Scripture is not orthodox but more closely related to Gnosticism. He explains away all miracles and is interested in that doctrinal view. There are some insights here but those who adhere to mainstream Christianity will not find much inspiring here.
1,Didn't last a year,"I bought this for my 5 year old son last year, and he loved it, but it just stopped working about 8 months after we got it. My husband took it apart and found burned parts and wires. He is an electronic engineer, and it is his opinion that it could have caught fire based on the parts they used and how much burned. I would not buy this apparent fire hazard again."
1,Piece of garbage!,Don't waste your money.....I ordered 2 of these and the same parts were missing from both packages. Very cheaply made and it shows.
3,Incorrect Information,"I just received my lamp in the mail. It looks nice, and so far it is working okay. The advertisement for this lamp on Amazon states that a bulb (50 watt halogen) is included, well, 2-40 watt decorative blunt tip bulbs are in fact included and required for this lamp, not a 50 watt halogen bulb. So, if you are shopping for a lamp that uses a certain type bulb, beware."
1,Not what was described...,"My mom and I have been having an extremely hard time finding a contoured changing pad that will fit my Sorelle Camden combo crib/changer. The dimensions of the changing pad in the product details state that it is 24 inches by 14 inches, which is exactly what I needed. What I received was a 33x17 changing pad :/ Will be returning immediately."
1,Dreams out of reach,"Jade Wu,in this dull book,goes through turmoil as her strict father is set against her practising modern dance."
4,"nice fabric, good fit",They fit perfectly. I like the fabric. After washing and wearing a couple of times I ordered 5 more pairs.
3,good but not great,"These panties give me full coverage, but they don't stay put very well. I've had worse, but Barely There Flawless Fit is better."
5,Best Ever,"These are the best fitting, most comfortable, panties I've ever worn. The mocrofiber has a luxurious silky feel. The waist band is built in and never rolls. There is no tag to irritate. I give Barely There Hi Cut Pants a five star rating."
2,not so comfortable,"Do not fit very well. Do not like that you can really feel them and they are not ""barely there"" at all. I prefer Bali products - they are turly barely there and are so comfortable."
2,Tight waistband,"Comfortable panty as far as fabric is concerned, but waistband runs tight. I also ordered a different size for my daughter, and she had the same experience with the waistband."
3,"Barelythere womens solid Microfiber Hi-Cut Panty Black, 8/9","I was disappointed, I have purchased microfiber panties from Target that were much more comfortable, I can't find them anymore I was hopeing I'd be able to use these as a replacement. I'll have to keep looking."
2,Not Good for Hot Climates,I purchased a couple of these to try before I bought more. I'm glad I did. I live in a climate that is hot and humid most of the year. This fabric doesn't absorb sweat at all. I'll have to stick with cotton.
1,What gives?,The description says that these are cotton but everyone posting indicates they are nylon. Which is it - cotton or nylon?
5,Comfy,Finally found a pair of panties that stay up with my pants' waistline...now I have one waistline instead of two!
5,Great underwear,I love the underwear. It's comfortable and doesn't bind. You won't feel like your're wearing it like other ones do.
5,Hi-Cut Panty,Very true to size-comfortable fit-wash & dry well with no shrinkage..Retain their shape after many washings..I would certainly buy these again!
5,Great product. Fits perfect every time.,Love this product. It always fits.Barelythere Women's Solid Microfiber Hi-Cut Panty #2303
5,Perfect fit for us,"I've tried many brands of panties and after a long search I found these. I've worn this brand for a few years now and have never found anything better. Even my wife, now only wears these as well."
4,"A Good Volume, But Definitely Not the Best One","Written when B.P.R.D. was just getting off the ground as it's own series, this book is mainly a collection of loosely connected short stories, which do a good job of introducing the characters but stand alone from the plot of later volumes. It's probably a good starting place for that reason. I enjoyed most of the stories in this volume, but I don't consider them the best work that has been done for the series, though that isn't saying much, since in general B.P.R.D. is very good. Perhaps the weakest offering, and the one that perhaps brought it down a bit for me, was the story ""Something Under My Bed"". While entertaining, both the art style and the premise just didn't seem to click with the atmosphere of the B.P.R.D. universe. It would have been better without these particular characters."
5,Great self-contained stories,Volume 2 of the wonderful BPRD series collects several single issue stories all by different creators. The highlight for me is the story drawn by the amazing Guy Davis. Highly recommended.
3,"a bit much, no?","i was excited to get this after i heard ""chick habit"" in the movie ""But I'm a Cheerleader"". this album is fun for a while, but her overly high, girly voice starts to grate your ears after a while. also, over half of it is in French, so there are repeats of most of the songs(one in English, one French) which is why it's so easily tiresome. if i could have, i would have just got the single."
3,Reading Andy Bear,"I thought that growing a polar bear cub was easy before, but it wasn't. I learned a lot about Andrew Nicholas Polar Bear. I'd like to recommend this book to people who are fond of almost extinct animals."
5,Dj X does it again!,"Once again Tampa Bays resident DJ, Dj X has brought us a riveted album for us to listen to and let go. Club Experience Vol 2 was highly anticipated and will be another large hit among the club mix cd's. A new version of ""Damaged"" titled ""Damaged '03"" has a great tone, and La Bouche's ""In Your Life"" is another hit on the album. I strongly suggest that ANYONE who enjoys club atmosphere music should by this album, but hey... I won it:)... Cannot wait till the next one come out..."
4,Shining Force 2,Yes I think this game is pretty fun. If you like roleplaying games. Now this is classic role playing game you got the hero then you have to defeat the person that is trying to destroy the world.
4,Solid Performer,"This thing made it a lot easier to build the 1000Sq.Ft.IPE deck I just finished. It sets up and tears down in seconds. Its solid even with heavier power tools mounted to it. The provided outfeed table works well but most of the time, it's not required;the right side outfeed roller is perfectly fine. The wheels are just the right size to overcome the pitfalls in most... lawns without being too large and cumbersome. The only drawback is its weight. Even without a saw or planer mounted to it, it's still heavy, so storage isn't that easy. Overall though, I wouldn't do without it."
2,not as universal like one would think !,"i bought this universal miter saw stand model 50-155 for my 12"" slide compound miter saw,and im un able to use the the aluminum table extension due to the space on either side. also the height is not high enough if it did even fit.not as universal as it says...."
4,Too small for big saws...,"This is a well made unit for the price. I have used mine for about 8 months on the jobsite, and in the shop.The only problem I have with this stand is it is not designed to fit the big saws (12 inchs) Delta, or otherwise. You have to remove the MDF table that is used for mounting, and then reverse the setup using the provided rails. If you do not reverse the setup, the side with the wheels attachted will not close up for movement.This unit is quite combersome with my big Delta attached, but does a good job of rolling, and is very steady when set up.The out riggers are nice for working with long lengths of materials.I would highly recommend this unit for the price."
4,I bought the stand via Amazon last Spring,"It came in good shape. It went together in a couple of hours. I attached my Bosch Miter Saw - it works great. It's heavy but the wheels take the load. (the saw was heavy without the stand). I had some steep hills to go up and down. It made my job easy. Now I have a portable saw platform. If your looking for a mobile stand that will last and find a spot in your shop as well, I don't think you will be disappointed."
1,Piece of CRAP,I have purchased lots of merchandise from Tool Crib which is operated by Amazon.com. I have been very satisfied and very proud of my tools and equipment and with the prices. With one exception - The Delta universal miter saw stand is a real piece of crap. Dont know how many parts Im supposed to have because there was no instructions in the box or where to put what parts I did get. [...]I will check the Reviews before I buy anything else. Someone got to know about thisRoy A Beasley
1,Delta is now Black&Decker,"Being a profesional builder, I have used Delta products for years, they have been dependable tools. Recently I found out I could no longer get parts for my Delta tools because these parts are no longer being manufactured. Seeems that when Black & Decker bought out Delta, they decided not to provide any more service to existing Delta products. I've owned a few B&D tools before and can tell you they just don't last. I will not be buying B&D/Delta tools any longer."
1,What in the @#%!,"Do you have to pay extra for all of the required parts? And do you have to pay even more for the instructions? Amazon, what is wrong with your company? I would highly suggest not to buy anything from amazon that is suppose to come in more than one piece. This looks like a nice stand, however, right now it is just a big paperweight as I can't even mount the saw to the stand. Do yourself a favor, buy elsewhere!"
4,Delta 50-155 Universal Miter Saw Stand,"A challenge to set up & align, but steady as a rock and (with clamps) can be used as a work surface. Read the directions carefully."
4,Delta 50-155 Miter Saw stand,"This is a very good and easy to use saw stand i have had it about 3 years, it is well made and will take a beating. It is much better than the last craftsman stand that i had. It was easy to mount my old Freud radial compound miter to, i did have to modify a couple of brackets to hold my old saw to stand. Newer saws would be no problem to attach. It will take long material making it easier for 1 person to use, it is very stable and with large wheels easy to transport over rough surfaces, and it sets up fast. Very happy with it."
3,It's hard to dislike...but...,"So, I'm a little disappointed that I didn't receive the manual with the stand and had to contact Delta to have a bad Xerox (that took over a week) sent to me...so, I'm less than enthusiastic about all of the nifty Delta ""extras"" not working with my saw - even though I own a Delta saw...so, I'm a getting frustrated over one of the plastic tension nobs arriving shattered (and I'm still waiting for the part to arrive)...so I'm totally bummed that two of the screws stripped out when trying to attach the handle (thus making the handle currently useless.) With all that said/written it's a pretty darn sturdy stand that I will enjoy using. So, if Delta had paid a little more attention to the details...THEY might not be disappointed about missing my 4th and 5th stars. In woodworking/carpentry ""the devil's in the details..."""
5,Solid as a Rock,"Assembly took less than 2 hours. I Mounted a Delta 10"" compound MS without difficulty. Stand is ""solid as a rock"", the end rollers support very long stock (even 16 footers aren't a problem). The large wheels make transport easy but a bit heavy. Overall quality is excellent, materials are first rate, the only difficulty in assembly for me was the self tapping screws for the cord bracket wouldn't fit the pre drilled holes."
5,Excellent Bargin!,"I have used this stand for several weeks and have found it well thought-out, versatile, sturdy and rugged. It assembles easily but you need to pay attention and follow the instructions (don't you hate that). It is very versatile. I started out with a Makita chop saw and after a few days changed to a Makita compound slider. No problems adapting the stand to either. The only problem I had was that the unit arrived in a badly beat-up box. The hardware was missing as were the instructions. I got the manual off the Delta web site and the hardware at a local shop. Overall great stand at a bargain price"
2,Be cautious with this,"Very heavy and not very convenient to lug around. Mine came without a manual. Called Delta, and they kept saying they will send one. So far not so good. I would sell this to anyone in a heartbeat."
1,great jig saw puzzle,"If this thing came with assembly instructions or at least a good photo to go buy, it might be a little more practical."
1,Delta 50-155 Universal Miter Saw Stand,Received the miter stand after waiting over a month. The box was heavily damaged and almost all the parts were missing. Delta's customer service said it was Amazon and UPS' problem. Packing by Delta and Amazon is substandard for this item. Might be a good stand if all the parts arrive. I returned it to Amazon and got the Rigid version from Home Depot.
3,DELTA MITER SAW STAND,"Received a heavily damagedbox via UPS last evening. Photo's available. The saw stand survived although there may be some missing pieces. Hard to tell since there was no documentation or assembly manual. Called Delta this morning, Delta will mail assembly instructions.The stand will not accomodate my Makita 12"" slider. It's about 2 inches too narrow. I plan to keep the stand and attach a wider piece of material which will lift the saw 1/2"" or so. Delta points out the the title ""Universal"" only applies to Delta made saws. Hmmm. Other than these annoyances, the stand looks like it will work well for material 10 ft or less in length. Longer will exceed the roller support but I knew prior to the purchase."
4,Great for certain saws...Not the DW705S,"Purchased this stand for my new Dewalt 12"" Compound miter saw, Model DW705S. It is a nice stand, good quality, and easy to use. The only problem is the Dewalt saw is too large for the stand. I couldn't use the aluminum fence, and I had to cut down the two aluminum saw supports. For most saws this would be a fantastic stand and I find it to be very convenient. If you're prepared to do a little modification, it will work for the 12"" Dewalt, otherwise you'll have to get something else."
1,Ain't Got No Instructions,We recived our stand in a great amount of time but no instructions were anywhere to be found in the box. Worse yet I looked all over Deltas Website and haven't found any directions as of yet. All this hassel makes this purchase a pain.
3,NO INSTRUCTIONS?,"Well, to start with. this is a very nice product! As with other people who rated this stand, mine also arrived with no instruction manual! What is so difficult about including a manual to inform you how to assemble this tool? I called Delta's 1-800 number & was informed that it was no problem, they would get one to me in about a week. Delivery for this stand was fast (5 days!), and no shipping charge. I have another small gripe about this stand....it was made in Taiwan, not the U.S.A. Overall though, once you get it assembled, you'll love it!"
5,Glorify Thy name,"This is one of the Hosanna Integrity of that moment. In those days the songs were ""Jesus-centered"". These days most of what they call worship songs are nothing but emotional reflections of the writers struggle with sin. There was even a case when one lied that he had cancer and they were making songs about this. This is not ministration but emotional reflections. They have been progressively getting more and more ""man-centered"". This is why these old HM albums are such a treasure. It is highly recommended"
5,Great nostalgia!,"I ordered this set for my husband's birthday, as he is a long-time fan of this old 50s and 60s series, especially Ricky Nelson. The episodes are fun and many old commercials are included. I would recommend this for any fan of these vintage TV programs."
5,Best O&H yet!,"I was hoping 'The Complete Ozzie and Harriet Collection' would come out, but so far, no luck. I've researched different sets, but none had as many episodes as 'The Essential Ozzie & Harriet.'This DVD set has it's ups and downs, but many more ups..Definately, a Must Buy, a 5-Star-plus Rating.Although this 12 Disk set isn't in the same order as the weekly show, in the first two disks, David and Ricky are young boys. As the episodes progress, so do the handsome brothers. From children to married adults.If you enjoyed Ozzie and Harriet shows, you'll love 'The Essential Ozzie and Harriet.'The price can't be beat. I hope they remake a second 100 Episodes, then a third, then the remaining shows. It might not be in order, but it's one way to get the complete collection."
4,Great DVD set,I love this DVD series. It has some very funny episodes. Only a few of them are lacking in picture quality but some of them are 50 years old. Still a good value for the price.
3,Enjoyment,"These shows are pure enjoyment. Simple,& funny. When you are through watching the show you have a feel good feeling. The shows that have the boys when they are younger (espcially Ricky), are very entertaining. The only thing that I did not like was the poor quality of the DVD's. The picture were not clear, very fuzzy. The shows were great, but poor in quality."
2,A plea for restoration.,"This comment is primarily for the benefit of those who came of age after the era of black-and-white television. In my opinion, the picture quality in this set ranges from fair to horrible (black tones totally gone). Even in those portions I rate as ""fair,"" much of the background detail is indistinct or muddy. The sound quality generally is decent, however. Despite these deficiencies, this 100 episode set is worth $11.49, the steeply discounted price. As others have noted, the original commercials are a nice bonus.It is a shame that so much of our television heritage has been allowed to degrade to this state. If you would like to see what a black-and-white television program of the same era looks like when properly restored, watch ""I Love Lucy"" on DVD. Almost as good is ""Perry Mason."" Given that ""The Adventures of Ozzie & Harriet"" ran almost three times longer than ""I Love Lucy,"" let's hope that this series will be properly restored and offered in season sets."
3,"A fun enough game, in the meandering spirit of Magic Carpet","Take note of other reviews. The game does not run very stably on XP, compatibility mode or not, or Vista. Hopefully, if you are playing old games like these, you will have at least one computer with Win98SE capability sitting around, on which it runs just fine.The gameplay itself will top out at varying points, depending on how much you like the arcade-style swarms of enemies and how much you like dragons. The dated graphics take away very little from the overall experience, and is hampered only by the low level of company support. I really have no choice but to mark it average due to the inconvenience involved to the masses of PC gamers using Windows XP."
3,"fun, but dated graphics",why anyone would want to pay the outrageous sums of money that people are asking this for is beyond me since you can get this at compusa for around $10 (or at some compusa's... I've seen a few copies at my local store.. don't know about other stores).
3,Good game no support at all,"I played this at a friends house and loved it. Purchased download that never worked right, so purchased disk. It never worked so after visiting three sites to find support, I have written three letters asking for help and have not been answered in two weeks. At this point I just want my money back or the game working. I will not buy a game from Strategy First again period."
4,..Almost.. Just as I expected.,"They appear just as the photo shows and the dimensions are correct.. I was expecting that.Although, I was expecting them to be a bit thicker, so they would sway and bend like paper. They are NOT paper thin, if you take 4 sheets of regular printer paper, pinch them together at any point, that's about how thick they are. They do not flex as much as those 4 sheets together do though. I was expecting them to be about 2.5x thicker (10 sheets of paper). This would reduce flexing. Used for pellet gun, although would be the ideal thickness for airsoft.But, I am happy with my purchase and would definately buy them again in the future. For the price, you can't go wrong here. They should last a good while."
4,desent product,"good price for the amount but there so small even with a BB gun at close range as in less then 30 feet there hard to hit. i use mine with a scope at 50 yards and a 30-30. any other use is virtually useless. paper is heavy, quality is fine."
5,Small Targets good for skilled shooters,Very Well packaged simple paper targets are excellent especially if you are not a rookie at shooting.If you are only the beginner it could be kind of hard to shoot. These are pretty small. But there are 100 of them in the pack so it is an incredible deal for the $4-$5 that you pay for it!
4,misread the advertisement,"For pellet and bb shooting, perfect. i will probably use these for longer range 22.practice where i am sure they will work fine"
4,Small,"I thought they would be larger. Gave them to my nephew to use with his BB gun, works great for him."
3,"Very small, and not for use outdoors","These targets are small than I expected. Not for use for any guns except BB guns and maybe a .22. The material they are made of is thicker than paper, which is good, but I had a hard time taping them to shoeboxes and cardboard to shoot at. Good for indoor close range shooting, but not functional outdoors."
2,Thought they would be good targets for archery,"I'm giving the product two stars not because of the product itself. When I bought these, I was looking for targets for archery. When I received them, I was disappointed to see the size.I admit fault. I didn't look closely at the dimensions or product details until after I received my order. I should have done so. But nowhere in the product description does it say these are archery targets. It says they are for ""Pellet and BB traps."" Therefor, I don't think they should come up when one is searching for targets for archery."
2,Too small to site in a new scope,I was looking forward to sighting in my new scope but I could not do it with these targets because they where too small.I dont think it is enjoyable having them so small.
2,"No size given, so didn't know what I was getting","Unfortunately, no size was given and the description should have included that these are used for pellet, air and beebee guns. I use target rifles and pistols at an outdoor range, and these will not be very useful. I imagine I'll use them for rifle practice. I was disappointed as now I'll have to make a trip to a gun shop for the targets I was expecting."
1,Not Great!,"This Item is way too small.It probably good for poking holes through.So if your looking for something big don't waste your time looking at this junk,Sorry Amazon this item is Way To Small!"
4,Targets,This was a Christmas gift for an advid hunter and gun lover. They were smaller than I expected-be sure to check the size before you order.
5,Good product,"I have several air soft tanks and use these targets for shooting contests with my son, the product is of good quality.Definitely a good buy"
3,"Not a great target, but gets the job done up close","The target is rather small (note the 5.5"" squared) and difficult to see shot patterns from a distance. I used it on a plywood backstop and anything more than about 50 ft and its very difficult to see. I ended up using about 10 and then just started printing out targets online that worked better for my needs (do an internet search to print out some free ones)."
3,Far smaller than expected,"My son received a BB gun for Christmas and, since this is the first gun of any type we have allowed in our house, he needs practice. I assume the targets are great for a master marksman but they were recommended for sale with the Red Ryder BB gun and are not very useful for a novice."
2,Target Size,"Perhaps I failed to pay attention to the specifications on this product, but once I received the targets they were extremely small. Perhaps once my aim gets better I'll feel cocky enough to think I can hit one of these down range, but for the meantime they'll be on the shelf.My fault."
3,VERY SMALL!!,"I was under the impression that the targets were a decent size. They ended up being about 4"" X 4"". Beware! If you're wanting a bigger target"
1,disappointed,these targets looked bigger than they actually were..too tiny to even use..waste of money. very disappointed. I should have noted the size.
4,good price,Bought these for my daughter to use but they are smaller than i expected. I don't think they will work for her but should work for my man so all is good for us... good price. lots of targets.
3,its to small,thought it was a lrge target. but it is about the size of an index card maybe a little bigger but not by much!!! Its made of thick cardboard so it could hold up to many pistol rounds if you could see it. Cant set it too far away.
4,Charleston's own,"This was a great little band when they were still together. Charleston's own little (ska)? band with a kick butt brass and horn section. Maybe they didn't get the recognition they deserved. Personally I think they should have gone a lot further. Anyway, the trips to Columbia to see them were great.Secret 68 is a great CD! Freak in my Candy was not bad but the promo CD was pretty awesome."
3,Not as good as the first,The new Fictional album fails to do the band any justice. It sounds more like a Funker album than Fictional. Their first full-player was a dance floor hit. This one keeps the music flowing more on a harder level than the first. As for the vocals well I believe they need to hire the former singer back. This singer fails to put any emotion into his voice. Which really just turns you off to the whole album. I was eager for this title to end shortly after the first two songs. I would tell anyone they would be better off buying the first record.
2,BORING,"I have liked all the books in the Desert Rogues series until now. This book was so boring I went to the end after the third chapter, just to get it over with. I have read the next book in the series already and loved it. NOT this one though. The only reason to read this one at all is if you insist on reading them in order."
3,motion sickness alert,"The graphics are good for a win95 game, but I couldn't get passed the motion sickness given by this type of game (flying through tunnels). I've been only slightly affected by some first person shooters (not enough to quit), but this is the first game that made me horribly nauseated. It works on winXP, if you want to throw up."
5,Awesome reflector at a great price,"This thing is nice!If you have never used one of these before, getting it folded up again can be a little tricky... Watch this video if you don't know how to do it: [...]The reflector with the cover removed is a translucent diffuser.The cover has silver and black on one side, and gold and white on the other (install the cover inside-out for the gold/white side).The only small thing I didn't like was how the surfaces are divided between the side - I would have rather had gold & silver on the same side of the cover, with black and white on the other.That's a pretty small inconvenience though, as it is so easy to take the cover off and reinstall it the other way."
2,The zipper is junk,"The zipper broke the very first time I unzipped it- the zipper got stuck and the handle broke off. It is still usable, but really annoying. The reflector itself works fine; this could be a decent product if the zipper wasn't such a cheap piece of junk."
2,Zipper gets stuck.,"This product has a reversible liner that acts as a slipcover that slides over a diffuser panel. If you aren't really, really careful when changing the cover (turning it inside out and re-covering the diffuser), the zipper gets stuck. While still functional, it looks sloppy and unprofessional. My solution is to have the color reflector I need already on there BEFORE you arrive at the photo shoot. #1 to avoid an unprofessional appearance and #2 to save time - if the zipper gets stuck it takes some time to guide the zipper back and forth properly to fix the problem."
3,"Good reflector, troublesome zipper.","This reflector is very versatile. It modifies light 5 different ways very well. However, as other reviewers have pointed out, the zipper gets stuck requiring patience and finesse to zip-up all the way around. Unzipping is not a problem. Wrestling with a simple piece of equipment during a portrait session or during a wedding is not a good thing. I would have given 5 stars if not for the zipper issue."
3,The zip sucks,I am happy with the reflector on the whole but please do not underestimate how annoyingly hard it is to zip this thing back up. I am not at the point where I want to send it back but a lot of the time I am only using 2 of the 5 options purely because the idea of having to zip it all back up makes me want to give up photography.
5,Great Product,I was surprise with this product. it's very broad when it is opened but i can fold it neatly. very compact.
5,"Right Product, Right Price","This reflector is fantastic. It is large enough to reflect a substantial amount of light. Plus, it folds. It's apparently quite durable as well. What else would you want from a reflector?"
5,Nice - Update: ring broke...,"It does what it does... 5 different reflectors (well one is a diffuser), and folds into a much smaller size.It's a tad bigger than expected for those of us that think in metric units, and I'm not sure I'm folding it exactly right, but that's fine.Update:I thought this was a great buy: the surfaces are useful, it folded well and the big size helps if that's what you need... But I can't fold it anymore, the ring broke and because of its size that means it's not portable anymore. I don't even remember it breaking... I'd used it only a few times. Bummer."
4,Provides nice lighting options in a convenient case,This works great when you want to control light on the go. Very portable. You can use as a reflector with black and gold or as a diffuser.
5,LOVE it!!,Love this reflector its huge ! Quality seems very well constructed. Would recommend this product.Just remember how large it is.
4,it's huge,"At first I thought it's a reflector how big can it be. It is a reflector, read on. I did not realize how big this reflector was until I got it. It popped open into this massive disk. My first thought is it's huge. Since that first opening I've used it to bounce light into speckled shade around sunset from 50 feet on to 3 people. It covered them all. I've used it to fill shadows in tight spots from other distances that may not be possible with smaller reflectors. Because of it's size it does make a great diffuser, again, able to cover multiple people.Because of it's size it does not pack up small. Yes, it does reduce in size to about 18 inches. Still it does require some shimming of gear in my on-location-bag to carry it. Since it does require an assistant to bounce light to the scene you may as well have your assistant carry it for you.The quality is good. It's a Wesctott. I've seen this brand in my local photo stores selling for much higher prices."
4,"A workhorse! Great, but some flaws.","I bought this with the light stand and reflector arm, so I will review all of them.Reflector:Good-Great and very usefull. I have put it to work in every single of my photo shoots.Bad-The zipper. Worked great at first then after some use it would get caught on the lining almost tore it. Before I figures out a trick (I'll tell you in the following section) I could only zip it up part of the way.Work-Around-If the zipper is giving you problems when you put the main piece into the reflector sleeve start pushing the main piece (diffuser) until it loses it's round shape. It makes it easier for the zipper to zip up.Light Stand and Arm:Good- They work well.Bad- Plastic holders and segment screws are easy to break. YOU NEED A SAND BAG!!!!! (Unless you have an assistant with you or there is no wind)"
4,Great Reflector. Bad Case.,"The quality of the reflector is great, but the case for it is absolutely terrible. I am very careful with all of my gear, but the first day I used my reflector, it started to shred and fall apart."
4,"works great, great price.","This only gets four stars due to the zipper difficulty. There really isn't anything wrong with the zipper, you just have to compress the disc a bit by pushing it into the ground or you wont be able to zip it up. I was a bit frustrated until I figured this out. Otherwise its everything you could want in a light reflection, blocker, diffuser device."
4,Nice Big Reflector,"This reflector is plenty big for just about any need. It was a little difficult to collapse, but other than that it was well worth the money."
3,Not as Advertised,"Like some others, the product that I received was not what was advertised. I received a no-name (Neweer???) 80 cm (31.5 inch) reflector instead of a Westcott Model 301 40 inch. It was a 5 in 1 reflector at least. The quality seems good enough, even if it is not what I was sold."
4,reflector,as many of the other reviews have stated the zipper is pretty flimsy. You have to be very careful to zip it slowly. Having said that the reflector itself works exactly as it should and the material is what you would expect for this price range.
4,"Solid, tight, effective. Hard to compact for me.",I recently got the 5 in 1 reflector and the unit was in a nice compact case. It was easy to open and it's a hoop that is twisted into a small diameter. To open you untwist it. It popped open into a nice full size reflector. As is it's a silver reflector on one side and black on the other. My problem is that I am having trouble twisting it back to its smaller size. (((( I don't want to put too much pressure because I feel I may bend the hoop. That's why I gave it 2 stars for ease of use. I may be the only one with this issue. :)) But it is very functional and a great price. (Now someone help me twist it back into compact size!)
1,Could not close it!!!,"The product is great in concept, but it was so ""springy"" I could not collapse it by myself to put it back in the bag. Had to return it."
1,Somewhat misleading due to photograh,"I purchased two reflectors. One was $12.00 and was 43"". The Wescot was over $30.00. Looking at the photograph I thought that it came with the stand, why else would it be $20.00 more?Had I known the stand and holder were sold separately I'd have gotten two of the other brand.Very misleading - and it didn't tell you in the description that it was a reflector only.Maybe they'll fix that little ""oversight""."
1,product is incorrectly advertised.,"The item shown in the ad is actually a Wescott model 304, not 301. The ad states its a 301 which doesnt include the pivot arm where the 304 does. The picture clearly shows the pivot arm tho. I contacted Amazon about this after delivery, but all I was told was that I needed to buy the pivot arm, but they apologized for their mistake. Whoopee. I'll make sure I by stuff from another place instead of amazon from now on."
3,It's a little bigger than I thought it would be,"It serves its purpose but it is bigger, and thus harder to handle, than I thought it would be. It really needs to be used with a clamping system or boom stand to be used well. But it does reflect and it does diffuse."
3,NOT AS PICTURED,How surprised I was when I received the reflector next day after purchase - great job Amazon.Quality of the product is very good and I think it will last for years.However I have mixed feelings about this purchasing experience mostly because the item I received was NOT AS PICTURED. On the picture item seems to be OVAL shaped however what I received was ROUND reflector. I mostly shoot portraits therefore oval would be more desired for me.Also it would be nice to know that you are buying what is pictured especially on the internet and from such a large and experienced retailer as Amazon.Quality of the product *****Purchasing experience **
1,might be worth spending a little more money....,"At first this reflector looked great, but after my very FIRST shoot with it, the zipper handle on the reversible flaps broke after the very first use, and the very next time I zipped it up again the entire zipper mechanism broke off, sealing it closed. I am very disappointed with it. Granted it was an inexpensive reflector, I would have to say it would probably be worth spending a little more money and getting something better. Other than the shoddy construction it does a good job at bouncing light. still, think about it."
5,Sturdy and easy to use,"I'm fairly new to the world of photography, just starting up my own photography business. This was one of my first purchases beyond my Canon Rebel and a nifty fifty lens and I think it's some of the best money I've spent.It feels very sturdy and well built. After reading other reviews on this product, I was concerned about the two-way zipper on the reflector cover, but by pulling out slightly as I closed the zipper, I had no problems at all and easily changed from the black/silver side to the white/gold side.I am also not so good at folding pop-up things down (like car shades), but this is really easy to fold down. I really like the size it folds down to and the carrying case it comes in. I absolutely recommend this reflector -- I've used it so much (inside and out) and I think it's a great value for the price."
5,great value for the price.,"These reflector disks are great! They fold down into a small size without adding wrinkles, the covers are easily interchangable, and they come with a carrying case. To be clear, the arm is not included, so don't be suprised. These do give rich reflective color and are large enough to actually put out some light. A great choice for the budget minded beginner!"
4,Good bargin,"I was in need of a 40-inch reflector, and I liked the idea of having one with a translucent option. One important thing to note is that the reflector does not fit in the bag with the zippered reflector panels attached to it. This is sort of a pain. I most often use the white reflector and have to remove the panel before storing. It would have been nice if the entire unit fit in the bag as one piece. That's really my only complaint. Otherwise, the reflector seems durable. I've seen better quality fabic used, but for a 5-in-1, this unit is a great deal."
5,great,"I love it. Seems well made though I can see the zipper is going to be an wear issue in the future. Zipping it wasn't that bad. You just need to bend down the diffuser while zipping and make sure the zipper teeths are close to each other while zipping.Otherwise, I'd recommend it."
5,Great deal for 5 different functions at $40,That comes out to about $7 or $8 dollars per reflector and it's at a large size at that.
3,Price match the quality,"This is no hidden gem, or supper deal. If you want cheap reflector, than this is right one.Quality matching price. Zipper brook on second use."
2,"Nice reflectors, but broke on the second use. RIGHT AFTER RETURN PERIOD EXPIRED.","Bought product on Aug 8, 2010. Used Once on Aug 20th, then another time on Dec 22nd. When twisting to pack reflector up, the flexible ring inside snapped in half. GREAT. Second use. To be fair, a friend has one and has not had a problem. But I have to eat $30 cause I have no company to complain to. The return period is over."
2,"For the price, you would be better with an offlabel product.","I chose this product because of the reviews and the name but realized that after just two uses, the bag that it folds into fell apart at the seams. If I knew that it was so cheap, I would have bought a cheaper set."
1,This book was so hard,when I started reading this book firat chapter was so easy but when I started the read chapter four and above it was vwer hard and the equations also so hard and the questions at the end of book their is no answers to compare your solutions with it.
3,Solutions for Instructor only,"If you would like to know the solutions, you won't get it. This book only supports the solutions for instructors. you know I mean we can't know the answers even if you requested it on its website. you still can't get anything."
4,Zelda Minish Cap,"This is a very good game. It has many sub quests and an interesting storyline. There aren't many dungeons in this game, but there is more exploring and fighting monsters in this game. Since you can shrink down in size, twists in the overworld and dungeons are influenced by size as well. The dungeons get pretty complex around the end of the game, but there aren't any overly difficult areas that make you think for a long time in the overworld. Overall, it is a good game, it just needs more dungeons."
4,"Good, but VERY short","The play control is great and the story line is pretty good, but it's just WAY too short! I remember the days of the Zelda for SNES where you played all the way through the game, 8 dungeons and the final battle, only to find out there are 8 more dungeons and an entirely new world to explore! Here we have 5 dungeons and an extremely small world to explore. Sure, there are a bunch of kinstones to swap, but that's only so entertaining. Overall, I liked the game, just wanted it to go on for another 5 dungeons!"
4,Zelda's Newest Portable Game,"This game is really creative. Shrinking with a hat, pretty original. I got this game and it was pretty good. The graphics are like four swords. The sound is OK, and of course, if you don't like it, just turn it off. The levels have fighting and puzzles like all Zelda games. The bosses are easy, which is disappointing because they are really easy, no challenge at all. Finally, the story is excellent. A new bad guy comes looking for power, turns Zelda to stone, you have to gather 4 elements and reforge a sword. A basic Zelda game. I give this game 4 stars because it's to short. I beat it in less than a week. Besides its that, this game was really fun. If your a Zelda fan, you should buy this game. You'd really enjoy it."
5,Good Game But very short,"I am a big Zelda fan and when i found out Minish Cap was out, i was really excited. The Minish Cap is a great game that is just a very short. the Kinstone fusion adds to the value but in the end i beat the game in 3 days. The graphics are great, the sound is good but is not like the other games in the serious. the gameplay is good with the shrinking and the puzzles are at a good difficulty. The problem is that it is short. Buy this game"
5,Wonderful title!,"I got this because I am a HUGE Zelda fan! What a great title for a handheld device. Usually you do not expect much from handheld titles, but this one truly delivered. Of course, what could you expect from a Zelda title though?"
5,the legend of zelda does it again!!!! i cant uderstand why it got bad reviews,Hands down the best zelda game ever! the game play and storyline are fairly long.a nd the music was awesome. You acquire so many new weapons along with some old classics. ...this game was greatgame-play = 9/10music 10/10story-line 10/10lasting appeal 8.5/10OVERALL= 9.5/10
4,"Kinstones are tedious, but the game is refreshing on GBA",This is a great game for the GBA. Capcom took the reigns for this Zelda installment and I couldn't have been happier. Fusing Kinstones and seeking out the people was tedious but involoving because players want to know what they create. Dungeons and boss fights were engaging but relatively easy. Highly recommended to all cubicle workers hiding their GBA activity from the boss!
4,Beautiful! Miyamoto brings back more fun!,"Okay, hour 1 of minish cap: It's 6:00pm and I'm still stuck on this one puzzle, the size of a piece of dust and Ezlo isn't helping me... success! I found the Jar of Gusts! I suck the spiderwebs off (You're sick if you're thinking what I think you're thinking I'm thinking you're thinking.) with the jar and get out of the extra entrances, quite frankly I'm entertained.Drowning in puddles... teardrops and getting jumped by pieces of pollen... what's not to want or need?! Mr. Miyamoto did not fail us, the gameplay engine was solid, the graphics, good for a GBA game, sound... wonderful! I swear, playing as a super-chibbi is fun, so if you want an affordable good game... don't buy this game... buy it if you want an awesome affordable game! Go Zelda!!!"
5,Zelda - GBA,The Zelda`s are the best of the RPG`s . They offer hours if intense enjoyable fun. If you plan to play thes games be prepared to spend some serious time. The graphis are the same as the SNES version. ENJOY!!!!!!!!...
4,Not a word!!!,"When i first heard about this game, I'm like this is gonna be awesome. I can't say i was totally disapointed.The game is really fun for the first bit, but it gets impossible and isn't really worth playing anymore.Pros:decent graphicsfun gameplayawesomely cool special itemskinstones are coolCons:Ezlo (your hat)is really long-winded and annoyingas i said before, gets hard and boringbeing tiny is more of a disadvantageyou never know where shinkers are hidingOverall, a decent game"
4,Best GBA Zelda ever,"With New sword techniques and neat graphics, Its great!!!Three words my friend: GET THIS GAME!!!!"
1,Battery failed,"This game would seemingly be an excellent game, however the battery that maintains the save files is dead and I can't save on the cartridge. Ugh."
5,it rocks!!!!!!!!!!!!,"this game rocks, it has to be one of the most awesome games ever, i mean you can shrink down and walk under leaves and stuff. you can go in mushrooms and just about anything. this is a great game highly recomended."
5,amazing!,this game is amazing great game play graphics are good i love it and you will if you get this game!ps to get magic boomerang fuse with all of the fairy's got to go to north hyrule field tree's with opening's go in them step on swicth's in all then ladder appear's above climb down it open chest and donepps need regular boomerang
2,oh man,"just because im giving this a bad rating doesn't mean that im offending this game, and the zelda games. i don't like this game because the game was boring and too hard."
2,let it burn,yo throw this game in the fire place to let it burn like usher. because this game is one of nintendo's worst. and the zelda games keep getting worse and worse every year.
2,The rating 5.0 9.0,This game was sorta good. U reading this might not want to get this game because u've got to get a betta game!
1,sucks,"this was one of the worst games ive ever played. and i wasn't impressed when i saw the commercial, and the gameplay."
5,HUGE WONDERFUL GUITAR,This is really a good deal - the sound on this great big dreadnought guitar is full and vibrant. Saw some demonstrations on YouTube which helped in my deciding to go with such a big guitar - that and the fact that it reminds me of my old Martin! You will definitely need a hard case for it.
1,still waiting for a response,"it's very difficult to push the strings in order to play a song, you have to push it very hard !!!I sent an email to the company 3 weeks ago and I am still waiting for a response....Bottom line, I really don't like the guitar..."
1,"No way, Jose!","Once upon a time there was a movie on TV entitled ""The Ice Harvest,"" and after watching it, I decided to order the so-called sequel in book form. I suppose buyer's remorse is too weak a term for my reaction to the latter, maybe outright disgust covers it better, though I didgive a second's thought to ""unreadable."" You get the jist, right?Honestly, I've read newspaper ad inserts that had more appeal than this novel. Plot? Undiscernable! Characters? Unbelievable! Readers, I think, have a right to expect some sortof thread that holds chapters, characters, scenes etc. at least s-o-m-e-w-h-a-t together, otherwise why bother?Save your money, folks, on this one."
1,Disappointed,"After reading and enjoying the Ice Harvest, I looked forward to reading The Walkaway. I kept waiting for he plot to come together, to tie all the time periods and pieces together, to do something other than meander. Finally, I had to give in and realize the book was going nowhere, but darned if I would quit. So I went to the end and found it incredibly boring, with a meandering set of plot lines and a pointless story to tell."
5,B Smart,"Waffles and French Fries for two, hold the mayo.Mark's one of the most entertaining and talented writers that I've come across and then there's the music. He picks like James Taylor and phrases his lyrics with the power and conviction of Jimmy Swaggert working up a good lather. I'm compelled to sing along at nausea while my wife encourages me to shut up and pay attention to the road.If you're not dumb, you will like this music. It's plain good."
5,inspector morse 25th anniversary collection,Great detective series. Best tv show I have ever seen. Wish there were more of this quality of show were still on tv. Never gets old.
3,Best for older children,"I have an 18 month old who is obsessed with basketball. He plays it all day, watches it on t.v. and reads any ball book he can find. So I though this would be the perfect buy. I was dissapointed to find this book is more suited to older children. It is a big book, for starters - hard for little guys to easily manuver. THere are lots of flaps - but many of them contain things like bobbleheads, penants and cheerleaders. Not something basketball addicted children care about. Overall it is a good book - but just not what I was expecting and not as game related as i thought."
3,Something here for everyone,"A book filled with everyday reality. Each poem will take you to another venue of Michelle's existence, exploring the emotions of each topic, in each poem, to their depth. She tells it like it is, no fluff here - no chance of misunderstanding, no wondering what, exactly, she meant! A 'breath of fresh air' on today's poetic landscape. NOT being Jewish, I LOVED the insight these poems provided. There is absolutely something here for everyone. - evvy garrett, author of Odium Bar & Cafe and Other City Poems"
4,"""older"" cell phone battery","By cell phone standards, my phone is considered old...but not to me. So, it was difficult to find a replacement battery for my cell phone. I was pleased it wasn't too expensive, but I'm disappointed the battery is fatter/thicker than the original. Now, I'm unable to keep the phone in its leather case. Bottomline, however, I am pleased with the product and speediness of receipt."
1,A Waste Of A Good Tree,"This is possibly the first attempt to write a 'definitive' biography of Sting, and in our view it fails spectacularly. Borrowing extensively from previous books - especially Sutcliffe and Fielder's ""L'Historia Bandido"" - and press cuttings the book is littered throughout with careless errors, and dwells, tabloid fashion, on the more sensationalist and 'media friendly' issues such as drugs, his sex life, and his involvement in the rainforest. In an 'exclusive' interview he gave to the Daily Express newspaper at the time of the book's release, Sting said - ""I have led a pretty wild life, but none of it's in the book"". He gave a more succinct review on Virgin radio when he said that the book was ""crap"". We don't disagree - it was fun to read at the time because it is about Sting, but it left you feeling a guilty and a little queasy afterwards."
1,Don't waste your time or money,"This is by far the worst book ever written about Sting. Just by reading it you can tell that the author does not like Sting at all. Sting himself even said the book was (bad)and that none of it is true. So if you are a Sting fan or just want to learn more about the man, don't buy this book, get the ""all this time"" dvd and you can actually see what of person he is."
1,"Tawdry, cheap, and utterly not worth your time.","If you're looking to learn about Sting, this is not the book for you. It reads like a cheap tabloid story, quoting anonymous sources for wild accusations, being downright mean to its subject (and also Sting's former bandmates in The Police, Stewart Copeland and Andy Summers). While Sting may have his share of skeletons in his closet and has no doubt lived a wild life, there is little in this book to lead you to actually believe the stories Clarkson tells. Reading this book also left me feeling vaguely uneasy and embarassed, as if I was taking part in spreading and giggling over naughty, mean-spirited gossip like teenage girls in a schoolyard. It's just that juvenile. NOT recommended."
4,Very Interesting for a true fan...,You cant really close the book...If you are a real fan and interested in his past life with his family/parents/sex life/marrige then this is the book for you.The only problem that I found was the way the book makes you believe (at the end) that he is a total snob and womanizer. This reason why I gave it a seven is because the author (i feel ) did not like him too much. That is the feeling I got.
1,Clarkson's Sting biography is a hack,"This writer's 1999 rendering of Sting's life is pitiful. Its ""Hardline""/docudrama treatment of Sting's experiences make what would be a compelling, intriguing topic an absolute bore. Do not read this book."
5,Jeffrey Evans' true r'n'r,"The 68 comeback is not ""roots"" or traditional R'n'R, it's not a retro band - the 68 comeback of former Gibson Bros. Jeffrey Evans is blues, garage, punk (yessir), r'n'r and sheer wildness and rawness mixed together and spit out on the streets of Memphis."
4,Dead on Nail Bag,"The bag is very good. There are some pros and cons. The back support is not all there. It tends to be to combersome and very very hot in the summer time. When switching to winter clotheing, it can be a chore. The so called heavy nylon is not so heavy, my bag tore the first day I had it, but with some thread and a needle I took care of it. Now the good stuff. The bag has a pocket for just about any thing you can carry. The pockets are very big which is a big plus because I have large hands. The most important thing is that is lightweight. A major plus. If I could get in contact with the designer we might just come up with something."
1,Big and Bulky,"I had bought this for my boyfriend as a Christmas present and was amazed at the size of the tool belt. To big and bulky for what he needs. I had to return it. So, if you're looking for big and bulky this tool belt is for you."
1,overpriced and low usability,"as a professional carpenter, a good set of bags is essential. unfortunately, these are not it. they are light, which is a postive, but they are weak. holes in the pockets and ripped stitches are the main dissapointment. the belt stretches out after a month or so. they are set up ok as far as pocket placement,but they are way too bulky. i find myself twisting around trying to get to the back side of the bags. i have owned and tryed to use these now for 1-1/2 years, mostly to try to justify the expense... the dead on bags are on their way out. i will try the occidental cordura bags and continue my search for a set of bags..."
1,Poor design and assembly directions are even worse!,"Not only did the brackets not allow the directionals to mount close to the wire mesh in the seat cowl vents, but the assembly instructions totally sucked! Had to return the item as unusable!"
5,Great Game,This is probably the best game for the Genesis next to Warsong. Like Warsong you earn experience to gain levels and eventually your people gain new classes and spells. The storyline is excellent too. I would highly recommend that you buy it if you can get your hands on it.I have an extra copy for sale but I cant sell it cause I dont have a credit card. If anyone is interested in buying a complete copy then email me at Mathis-@webtv.net
5,BEST RPG GAME EVER!!!,"Shining Force is the best RPG I played,plus I have part 1 & 2 and I rate it 10 out of ten so if you're into RPG I recommend you get this as fast because this the only store that has them.Awesome graphics and gameplay!!"
5,Cable Cutter,Cuts 25 pair copper cables like butter. Great tool for you telecom guys and gals. I strongly recommend this tool. Good price. Fast shipment.
1,Stamps don't stamp well,"I was excited to use these stamps to talk about feelings with my son, but was very disappointed that the included stamp pad was virtually useless. There was no way to get enough ink on the stamps to then make a print on paper! Even using a different stamp pad that we had for arts & crafts projects, the results were only marginally better and required multiple applications of ink before getting sufficient coverage (so maybe the problem is the stamps themselves; they are a very hard foam and would require a very wet stamp pad). Such a shame. I have otherwise been pleased with Alex Toys, but this one just was a real disappointment."
3,only 3 stars,"Zipper was good quality, but only 3 stars because it took forever to arrive and the picture does not show it clearly, so I ended up with a zipper whose teeth are way too large for what I needed."
1,Wacky is Right,"This book is not so much instructional as it is story telling. Many examples are constant references to other animals the author has (unrelated to the raising of peafowl). The information is also cut short as the author had only limited knowledge of a couple of the breeds. If you are looking for a book on Peafowl husbandry, this falls short. But it is pretty good for a 10 year old to get familiar with peafowl."
4,Interesting and entertaining,"I enjoyed this book. It gives insight from raisers of peafowl, and I think that any information is welcome since books on peafowl are rare. This book is best intended for people not terribly familiar with peafowl, however, at times it seems more like a show-and-tell by the authors rather than a purely informational book. Still, I found it interesting and fun."
5,Ranks with the best,"The setting for this collection of poems is Alaska, and like the landscape expect to be stunned by powerful images. Though there are real gems throughout, read it, if just for poems like 'Ivory', 'Rhythmics' or 'Waiting'. The themes are universal, and the poetry as good as it gets."
3,Not the best!,"If you have a mirror to view your baby, dont waste money on this product! My own fits infront of the mirror so I can't see her at all! The toy is ok product, no complaints at all. Should have been better designed."
1,An author babbling ...,"This book is an insult to the artist it claims to honor. Here we have a musician and songwriter trying to be worth every single dime his fans spend for his albums and concerts, an artist withholding wonderful songs for years because he doesn't deem them good enough for release (cf. Tracks); there, we have a Harvard professor who seems to be short of cash and puts out two new books a year to make a little extra money (see the ""also by Robert Coles"" list on the first inside page).The basic idea of the book is an interesting one, but nothing is worse than a good idea executed badly. Anyone could have written that book in two days: Just go out and ask five of your friends what they think about Springsteen, than have a secretary type what's on your tape, do not edit it, but send it to the publisher immediately."
1,Town full of losers,"With so much great potential in this project, it's a shame it had to be so terrible. Can you imagine if the author had talked to people who had a functional understanding of Springsteen's music, instead of just people who were like, ""Yeah, I listened to him back in the eighties! 'Borrrrn in the USA!!!'""?The author is remarkably uninteresting, and his subjects not much better. Even the cop, commenting on ""41 Shots,"" could have been engrossing had they picked a more interesting cop. This one was just like, ""How? How could be betray us?"" Not even giving a moment's consideration to the real question of whether they were betrayed or whether those cops really were racists and murderers. Would have been nice to at least touch down on that point."
1,endless drivel from someone who doesn't know Bruce.......,"I opened this book with the expectation that the author would take us on a journey of Springsteen's lyrical talent, only to discover that Robert Coles truly does not appreciate what Bruce is giving to people. Instead, he focuses on himself, talks about people he knows who bear no connection to Bruce, even includes an inane poem that he wrote in honor of Springsteen and a person he knew: ""Dr. Williams"", that he somehow sees a connection to. I wish I had researched this author more...... I would have seen that he's published more than 50 books, and that this book is clearly just a marketing move. That old caveat is true ""Don't judge a book by its cover""; I would add to that: ""or its title!"""
5,Elvis Is Gold,"McFarlane makes the best figures, and this Elvis figure is just fantastic. Looks exactly like the King of Rock. The details are just amazing with his famous gold leaf outfit, from his early tours and his album cover ""Elvis Gold Records, vol. 2"". I like all of the toys so far, only one I don't have is the Vegas Elvis figure, which I think is the worst from the bunch. Elvis rules, and these figures capture his essence and his lasting effect on todays rock and pop generation."
1,Poor design,"This pill cutter was very poorly designed. There is nothing to hold the pill in place and by the time you get the top with the blade on, the pill has moved. I would never recommend this product to anyone."
1,Almost unusable,"This is the first time I've EVER given an unfavorable review. I should have heeded some of the other reviews before I purchased this one. I should also note here that I am a very experienced pill-splitter and my old splitter was getting toward its last days.Using this splitter, it is VERY hard to get the pill centered and the ""split line"" of the pill lined up, then when you push down to split it, it usually splits into 3 pieces, and you can't get a whole half out of it. I tried gently pushing and then firmly pushing . . . same results. My husband's heart pills have to be split, and they DO have a split line on them, but they are rather hard. This may be the problem, but when you only get 45 pills for a 90-day supply and you ruin 3 or 4 of them, you lose 6 or 8 days.I'll go back and use my old one that has a v-shaped holder. I did have high hopes for this item, but it was not to be."
1,Terrible Pill Cutter,I purchased this pill cutter because of other good reviews. It's the WORST pill cutter that I have ever used.While it has a magnifying glass built into lid I still have had trouble getting pills cut in half even when I cansee the blade right on the center of the pill. Bottom line. I would NOT recommend this pill cutter.
1,Crushes Pills,"I got this in hopes that I would be able to cut tiny pills into 1/8's. I thought the magnification would be wonderful. Not only did it not cut the pill into 1/8's, it wouldn't even cut the pill in 1/2 without crushing it. This might work okay for very large pills, but didn't work for what I need. Now I'm just using the bottom portion as a tray to hold the pills while I use an Apex pill cutter to cut the pills."
1,Crusher not Cutter,"Totally useless if you want to cut your pills in half. I did it gentle, fast, slow it doesn't matter. The pills get crushed in many pieces even though my pills have a break point which should make it easier. Guess I have to do it with a knife again. I uploaded a picture so you can see what my pills looked like after using this. Very disappointed."
2,Love/Hate,"I have a love/hate relationship with Lorie Line. I love about 1/3 of her releases and hate the others. Her first Sharing the Seasons release was, in my mind, superb from start to finish. I love the peacefulness and simplicity of her music, when she doesn't let it be overcome by technology. I was disappointed in this release. I could be off target with my assessment, but it seems heavily influenced by Manheim Steamroller, of which I am not a fan. Lorie does best when she sticks with her roots and the simple, exquisite piano arrangements and leaves the tech music to others."
5,All Time Favorite RPG!,"I'm still playing this game after 17 years. It has tremendous replay value and it's one of the most extensive cartridge video games that I have ever seen. I also like it because you're just in charge of one character and don't have to worry about controlling a group of a dozen characters.P.S.- Yes, I have played the game through to the end several times. I didn't want you to think that I hadn't finished it even once after 17 years. LOL Now I play it on a system called ""RetroN 3."" It plays Sega Genesis, original 8 bit Nintendo, and Super Nintendo games.....all on the same system. I got it for only $70."
4,USMC Theater of Ops 1944-45,I was very interested in this book as a research tool. It had been referred to me by a presently serving Marine in response to a question I had concerning assault squads/teams on Iwo Jima.I was initially very disappointed in the actual size of the book when I first saw it. it looked quite thin and I felt it was not $25.00 worth of book however after sitting down and reading it I felt better about it. It did help me in my research.
2,What a drag.,"We picked this up on clearance, and found out why. We used it once, which went great! Then about a week later, I plugged it in, the power light came on, but the heating element didn't heat up. I was getting power, but no heat. Tried the reset button with no luck. Very disappointed. Well, we'll take this back, and try a different brand."
3,Not great for Clam Cakes...,"The T-Fal FR4015002 --Litrer Family Pro Deep-Immersion Fryer has one important flaw.When trying to deep fry batter-type foods, such as Clam Cakes, you're not supposed to use the basket. Fine. But, the batter sinks to the bottom where the elements are and gets adhered to them. It would have been nice to have the elements on the under side of the oil pot so that the frying recepticle would be free of obstacles."
1,Great when it works,"I had the older model with the flat panel LCD screen and push button controls. First time used the backlight on the screen failed. Controls and timer weren't intuitive and difficult to program so I used a stopwatch to time cooking. Temps didn't hold consistent nor was heat up consistent sometimes it would come to temp in 5 mins other times 15. When it did work it was great, excellent capacity, basket raise and lower seemed strange the first time I used it but now I love it and think it's the best feature on the product. Mine finally died right in the middle of use the other night. I think the problems I had are strictly related to the flat panel model, I plan on buying the new knob control unit. Sometimes all this fancy programmable stuff is more of a headache than a benefit. The new unit with knob controls is the way to go, do yourself a favor and stay away from the older programmable model."
1,Everything's fine unless you want to watch sports,"Apparently this unit has an issue with the V-Chip blocking sports games even when all blocks are set to off. I recently purchased this from Walmart and got a great price, but one of the only things I have tried to watch are the NBA playoffs...which get blocked. After searching the forums, it appears that others are complaining about the same issues for other sports games, and there seems to be no fix."
1,Piece of Junk!,"This tv went bad within 4 months. No matter what channel I have it on it goes back to channel 1, within a minute or two. The year warranty is worthless since the company will not issue a ""return merchandise"" form which is required to send it back. Their customer service never gets back to you and does not honor their guarantee. I should have did my homework and looked at the other reviews regarding VISCO. Visco is NOT Vizio which is a Quality company. STAY AWAY from VISCO if you don't want a headache and to waste your money!"
3,I love Max...but,"Max Lucado is a wonderful author. He is a master of words and always makes me think. I love reading his books, as well as listening to his sermons. This being said, I couldn't help but notice that a good portion of the material in this book is basically repetitive material from his other books (or from his sermon material). I know that it's probably difficult coming up with 100% new material when you've authored and preached as much as Max...but for those who love to read his books, it would be well worth his effort. Nevertheless, this is still an excellent book, and anyone who likes Max will enjoy it even though some of it is obviously rehashed from prior publications."
5,Goose bumps by page 10,"Max Lucado hits another home run with this book. ""Come Thirsty"" arrived at my house just when I felt I was going through a dry spell. His method of conveying God's love and the promise of your spiritual thirst being quenched by the living water of the Lord is,as always, clear, concise, and uplifting. Don't miss having this one in your Lucado collection."
5,Ahhhhhhhh....what a drink!,"Come Thirsty is a thirst-quenching, satisfying read......loaded with thought-provoking stories and Max Lucado insight. It is my ""new favorite"" Lucado book!"
4,Excellent for B&W,"I purchased this filter specifically for work in the black and white area of photography. With the color parameter on my Rebel XT set to Black and White, I attach this filter and go to work. Works wonders on landscapes, particularly when there's more foliage than sky. I don't see a great deal of light lost in using the filter and with a little added contrast from Photoshop, I'm producing great quality b&w prints. Hoya is known for quality filters and I have quite a few of them in my camera bag. I'm happy to add this on to the collection as it upholds the level of quality I've come to expect from Hoya."
1,VERY big disappointment,"Rambling more describes how this book is written! Very little about New Orleans and mostly about the author and people he knows, not even those that live in New Orleans. I found myself skipping whole pages as the author rambled on about some part of his life. Not sure who would find this book interesting but no point in buying it if you think you are going to learn anything about New Orleans. At least it's short!"
2,"Not for really ""brand new readers""","I'm not sure why these books are so highly rated. Yes, they are cute stories and just the right length for young readers. However, they rely too heavily on sight words, including many sight words that aren't particularly useful for beginning readers. I tried these with my 4 and 1/2 year old at his teacher's urging. While entertaining, they seem pointless at this stage as a learning tool. They provide little opportunity to practice phonics. Further, they introduce some very random sight words and ignore frequently occuring sight words that he needs to learn for fluency. I do think that these will be good after he's mastered phonics and basic sight words, but they are not geared to ""brand new readers."" My daughter's kindergarten teacher introduced me to many books that were better suited to a brand new reader. I also think Dr Seuss books, while very long, do a much better job of introducing phonics and sight words."
3,NOT for Children,"Yes, this is a very good tale, written in a wry and captivating manner and most of the illustrations are lovely. HOWEVER, I bought this at my daughter's request for a ""beautifully illustrated fairytale"" for her 9th birthday. Thank goodness I decided to give it a look before I gave it to her. The evil princess displays the decapitated heads of her suitors outside her bedroom window, ravens pluck out the eyes and dine on decayed flesh. The witch's table is carved with a couple engaged in sexual intercourse and the princess is fond of wearing completely see-through gowns. I don't think these are things most parents want their children contemplating in a bed-time story."
2,Title sounds exciting,I have been going to Baja for almost 25 years and have a place near Loreto. I ordered Baja Legends the other day because of the title thinking it would be full of interesting characters and new information. It is more like an encyclopedia. Facts. Lots of them.
5,If you could only have one Baja book,"Buy this one--seriously, it has so much more than history. It's got plenty of photos and maps, but it also has great stories about famous and not so famous locations, and stories about hotels, and famous names, and places to go, and even some great bars."
4,good read,the book is very interesting in that it goes town by town and tells the stories that are real or legendary about real people who lived there. it is the type of book that you can read and reread and put down and pick up at a later date. quite enjoyable and i recommend it for anyone who wants to know what came before !!
5,An indepth history of Baja California..,"with little known facts, remote places, and recommendations for side trips off Highway 1. I won't travelthe peninsula without this book as a guide."
2,You're better off with a simple donut.,I bought this because I thought I might be able to hit balls with it on my clubs. No such luck. You're better off with a simple donut style swing weight. The donut weights are much easier and convenient to use.
2,Buy the real stuff instead,"The comment above is right on. A mildy entertaining CD that I think Ill trade in for the much better Eric Clapton ""Blues"" double CD."
3,any tribute,ive gave it three because of buudy guy(strange brew) and koko taylors(blues power} eric gale/derek trucks(layla)
2,BUYER BEWARE!! POOR QUALITY!!,"I wanted the highest quality NASB large print bible I could find. I hoped for top-quality leather, binding, and paper. I was very disappointed. The leather and paper are excellent. The printing appeared to have been done well. The problem is the binding of the bible. It's been done shoddily at best. It began to fall apart about the sixth time I opened it. I couldn't believe it!! To save money, Foundation Publications sends good quality material to China, and has the production of the bible done there. If you want very high quality that will last a lifetime, google Allan Bibles, Oxford , or Cambridge Bibles. They cost a little more, but WELL worth the price. Allan bibles are the best, but they don't have NASB. Oxford and Cambridge have NASB, but not large print. If you want a high quality leather bible, do not buy this one!"
3,The NASB Sweat-Shop Edition,"It seems no one can make a decent Bible these days. Either you get great binding and thin paper with heavy bleed-through (Allan) or good, high opacity paper with lousy binding. This product has the latter. The paper quality and font size are great but it's the most slapdash binding I've ever seen in a calfskin Bible. The reviews about the endpages coming apart from the cover are spot on. Atrocious construction. The only reason I'm not returning it is because I like the NASB and it has great paper. Tomorrow I'm heading out to pick up some Barge glue, which I've read is the best for repairing leather. I plan to reinforce the endpages, possibly even replacing the endpage paper with more durable stock. If you don't mind a little post-purchase repair work, it's a good Bible."
2,"Nice idea, but after two replacements in 4 months, maybe not","The nice things about this Bible are the wonderfully soft, flexible, and quite thick calfskin cover coupled with nice paper and good print.However, the adhesive used to attach the beautiful leather cover to the book block is quite poor, resulting in the pages separating from the leather at both front and back. While the company seems willing to replace defective units, I am no longer confident I could mark up this Bible and use it long-term. I have heard of a UK publisher that promises a better bound book, and for the money, I will go this other route."
2,This is Not an Ultrathin Bible,"The Bible is not ultrathin; it is a full-sized Bible. Unfortunately, we had to return it because of that fact."
2,It's..okay?,I got it a few weeks after I got my lip pierced and I didn't like it. It's like mouthwash mixed with tons of salt. I used it about 4 times and just didn't bother anymore. I wouldn't suggest buying.
5,Would Like to Hear More of Her...,"This Cd contains three songs. ""Whenever You Need Somebody"" is my favorite because of it's meaning and her presentation. I heard the song years ago, so when I saw this cd on Amazon, I immediately purchased it."
4,Moves along at a good pace!,"I really enjoyed this book. The format took a little getting used to and over all I did not care for it as much as his previous style. I definetly recomend reading it as it has a lot of action in the air and on the ground. If you are a ""Carrier"" fan, you will have a hard time setting this book down. I'm looking forward to the next one!"
1,handle comes loose,I am pleased with the cooking part of the skilletBUT the screw holding the handles keep coming loose.and the handles are LOOSE.I even purchased some kind of glue to hold the screws and that did not helpI will contact customer serviceDart
3,a decent product for the price,"We purchased this skillet 2 years ago and right off the bat it cooks way hotter than the temp setting,Fact is you cant really cook past about 250 and just the warm setting will burn your food if not careful,We got used to it and its little idiocincricies.Unfortunately the non stick. has gone bad and it does stick much. We use it more than twice a week and feel its better than most we have had.After 20 years in my business one of the main reasons i quit is no matter how hard you try to get great products at any price mediocre seems to be the flavor of the day.Been reading reviews here all day and money and price guarantee nothing."
5,Perfect size,"I was concerned that this Presto electric skillet would be too large and hard to clean. I was worried for nothing. It seems to be the perfect size, no matter what I'm cooking. After dinner I load it in the dishwasher and it comes out looking brand new. I've never been happier with a small appliance. Highly recommended."
3,skillet,HUGE skillet--has a hot ring area where heating element is--does not heat evenly--good for large families
4,It deserves a 5 star now that I have used it,"It is March and I still have not used my new electric skillet. It is beautiful - but there are only two of us in the house and it is definitely meant to cook for more people (in other words, quite large). I will critique as soon as I have an occasion to use this skillet. I now use this electric skillet at least 2x a week. All I can say is - great pan. So easy to clean, and cooks great pancakes, eggs, bacon, etc. When I have company - can't ask for anything else. I am buying me another one just so I will have it when I have used this one to the max.JB"
2,Would not reorder again...,"This cap is small! It is more suited to a young teen-aged person than it is to an adult. It is a very cheap stocking cap, not at all what I expected for the price. Ordered it before Christmas and just kept it, will use if children visitors are in need of a cap, but still don't have what I wanted for my husband!"
5,"Giuffre is wonderful, inventive, playful and haunting","Guiffre, Hall, and Brookmeyer are all wonderful. The best of cool jazz. Their music opitimizes what happens when musicians listen to each other. Chamber music that is fun, inventive and lovely."
4,This should be CNA standard equipment,"This book is a very good guide voor system administrators (CNA-level) who are not yet/little familiar with the Novell Zen for Desktops suite. For more advanced users this book can serve as a quick reference with complete coverage of the subject.In itself Zen is a very powerfull product, and with the use of the linux PXE system I've seen wonderfull things happen. Most of those users started out reading the PXE section in this book.Regarding the first reviewer; Never judge a book by it's cover."
4,Full of Great Stuff,"This book is jammed with great ideas for music classes or for any elementary school class where the teacher wants to inject a little fun. If you can get past the author's ""controlling nature"" -- she basically tries to tell you what clothes to wear and how to say ""good morning, class"" -- it will be well worth your while. I teach music in Los Angeles and use this book constantly."
2,"Well Based, but a bit Dated","I was largely underwhelmed with this book. Though it does have some techniques that can be helpful and some good warmups, I thought the majority of it was very common sense and would be covered in most teacher prep programs. Good teaching techniques can be good reminders for even the most experienced of teachers, but I can't imagine that too many people forget how to give constructive criticism to students or how to sing ""Bingo"" with students' names. Also, there's no mention of technology (besides CD players), which can and should play a large part in the modern day classroom."
4,worth the money,"Was a good book overall, but i would have liked to see more on subframing in early 50s chevies. The paint sections were good. If you want to build hot rod this is a good place to start."
5,The best book on fiberglass I've read so far.,"Its not easy to write something on this subject. The 2 previous books on fiberglass I've read try to cover every possible aspect of the subject and my eyes glass over after about the 4th chapter. This was well written and seems to tell me just what I need to know. This book is general enough to be readable. The way it is worded is very down to earth and it reads well - the author doesn't try to impress me, just inform. Thanks Tex. Anything more I need to know will be from experimentation and asking other professionals. I usually just start calling paint shops or posting to newsgroups."
3,ok I guess,"I was kind of disappointed with this book. But to be honest, I am not really sure what I was expecting to get from it. This is the first time I received something damaged from Amazon, I thought I was buying a new book, what I got was a well used book with pages torn out and damaged."
4,A revealing work.,"First off, let it be said that this is not a critique from the right. People ought to read this work, which is more informative in terms of what we want to do now than, say, the Bolivia Diary, which we don't want to repeat.One can see here something that has plagued the left for many, many, years. Throughout Che's work, there is a very comprehensive idea of the ""good"" person and all members of society will be molded into such a person. Che says that in socialism, heroism will become a feature of everyday life.This sort of hypermoralistic perfectionism is not what governments should be doing. Heroism should ""above the call of duty"" and not made a public goal. Governments should expand freedom, which could very well include redistributing wealth or changing workplaces and forms of ownership. But creating the new socialist man should be left up to citizens to figure out.Elections would be nice, too."
2,Need some improvements,"I am new owner of this tool and I admit the idea is brilliant compare to GERBER's for compactness, but the linkage mechanism should be RIVETING not BOLTING. I feel so uneasy whenever I use it since the bolts are easily untied and gone away.If I tie up the bolt, the returning procedure of each tool is very stiff which is very dangerous especially for using knife.All I found it useful is bottle/can opener because of it.I sugest the leatherman people to improve it."
3,Defintiely not a Must-Buy,"Good, but not especially memorable stories of women who made foreign marriages: either Americans who married non-Americans, or non-Americans who married into American families. I read the book several months ago, and none of the stories remains clear in my mind. Worth a trip to the library, but don't bother to buy it."
2,an interesting but flawed short story debut,"this is an interesting fiction debut, but ultimately the author fails to deliver what she attempts to achieve. the characterisation is somewhat cliched in some of these short stories. although the first tale is clever in construction, the artifice becomes wearing as the book progresses."
1,Rather disappointed.,"I rated this encounter as 1 star solely because it was shown as a series of books 1-4 and I only received one book. I realize this has nothing to do with the book, I love it, but with 4 grandchildren I chose this series so that each could have their own book. How do I divide one book among the four. Your set up was very misleading."
4,Do NOT expect to get any training tips from this video.,"The Body of Work documentary film profiled the 1997 Physique-Transformation Challenge and its 10 finalists. The first half of it makes a great motivational video. The second half drags and could have been edited a lot better. The bit about the lie detector tests was totally unnecessary. And, all the controversy about picking the finalist could have been a lot shorter. Just don't expect to get any training tips from this video. It is all about selling the dream of achieving a championship body."
2,Look elsewhere,"I love ABB and have seen them at their best (first tours in '69-'70 and the Seven Turns era) This is not an inspired or inspiring recording. The band sounds tired and listless for the most part. For you fans of Derek Trucks(which I am not)he hasn't yet inserted himself into the ABB sound at the time of these Beacon shows. Dickey is hardly present and a shell of the player he was around the late 90's. Despite what some other reviewers have mentioned, Gregg's singing on this set is not near his best. His range is limited and he's struggling to stay on key. Granted, he's not able to reach the high notes of his younger days but, I've seen him in the past few years and singing way better than here. This record is for completest fans only. With all the great live Brothers discs out there, look elsewhere........"
4,and i aint wasting time no more,"with the allmans there is so much intricacy in their music, that any negative assessment would be vastly premature, so im saying buy it as part of the ongoing process. with the changes in the org and some new licks being learned in the process, take it as a jam and enjoy it: they still play very well and even earlier cds and tapes have a vastly improved ring on 3rd 4th play or tenth year after affect , such as enlightened rogues, live in montana esp, kick back and enjoy it, ive listened to dickie, the trucks band, and mule, all contain some very talented licks, it would be hard to do everything right all the time, esp considering the nearly 40 years the band has been playing"
4,In my opinion:,If Greg Allman thinks that Derek Trucks guitar playing is not up to snuff for his tastes then why would Greg hire him in the first place? If that is the case then Derek Trucks is better off in his own band by himself alone (with others backing him as support) but in a full outfit band altogether (the issue is unity as pertains to bands as a whole in the first place) and after hearing THE DEREK TRUCKS BAND (his name is attached to the band for a reason) he has nothing to worry about because he's famous and making plenty of bank.
2,Confirmed,"Members of the band have confirmed that this is just a contractobligation filler. They wanted out of their deal with Sony, so they said you get what you get and here it is. Quote ""None of us are proud of 'that thing'"". Now they're hunkering down to put out a new album of new material with Warren back in the line up and creating their own label. Masters of their own destiny.Vanity or not, at least there's new material on the horizon."
2,a very big disappoinment,"how this album was even released is beyond me. the song selection is great, but the sound quality is very muffled, the band sounds bored to death and the harmonizing is embarassing. every song sounds like it was put in low gear. i love the allmans but this captures them at an all time low."
3,"***1/2 - pretty good, but inessential","Probably the least of the Allman Brothers' numerous live albums, ""Peakin' At The Beacon"" contains plenty of good guitar playing, some great songs (and a few lesser ones), and it sounds good, too (without being fantastic).But there's really nothing new here...the two excellent ""An Evening With The Allman Brothers Band"" albums already covered their latter-day Epic Records material, and most of the older songs can be found in equally good or better versions on previous live albums.This one serves mainly as a reminder that the Allman Brothers Band still sound the same. That's okay, but of minimal interest to less than totally devoted listeners - unlike the brand new live album, ""One Way Out"", also from the Beacon, which can be easily recommended even to more casual listeners."
2,Time to regroup fellas...,"Since this was Betts last outing with the band, he doesn't seem to be in sync with Trucks and therein lies one of many problems with this disc. As far as the songset goes, it's darn near perfect, with some of the old classics revisited(this should have been the case with the 1st and lousy 2nd set cd's but wasn't)but 'High Falls' just drags on way longer than it should have, 'Whipping Post' would have been a better choice. The band sounds tired and unrehearsed and Gregg's vocal are bit raw, maybe the end of the tour? Clearly Betts and Trucks are not a good match: sour notes, sloppy playing, etc. Basically a nice try but no cigar, maybe next time it will be better."
2,Don't waste your money!!,"I'm a big brothers' fan but this is simply a disc thrown together to fulfill a contract obligation. ""Evening.. 1&2"" pretty much show the band in it's great mid-90s form. There has been no new music from the ABB in 7 years and now that Dickey is gone it's time to hang it up. It's not that the ""new ABB"" won't make good music, it's just that they're NOT the ABB! Name it something else!"
3,Tapetrader,"I have mixed feelings about this album, the reason being is because I have this show on tape. It probably would be good for newbies who is just starting a tape collection. Because I am an ABB fan, I am like the taxpayer, whether I like it or not, I pay my taxes, likewise for the CD. Twenty years from now, this CD may grow on me, but for now, the FILLMORE EAST legendary shows remains supreme. The earlier albums have class to them whereas this one seems hastily put together and put out on market to fulfill recording contract obligations. Their last studio album was in 1994 when WHERE IT ALL BEGINS was released. The ABB really needs to put out a new studio album soon; I can't see that happening anytime soon given the bad feelings the band members have. I am stuck in a time warp and happily listening to the ABB when they were in their glory years. If you are a bonafide tape trader, by all means, stick to tapetrading unless you are like me."
1,Released for a quick buck...,"I have a lot of Allman recordings, and even replaced many of my Allman vinyl with CDs. I'm just saying I'm a loyal fan, but this recording is sonically very bad considering todays standards. The playing is boring. It's as if they played the concert and took solos while intensely watching a football game on TV. I haven't reviewed in this forum, but I'm compelled to tell everyone to avoid this cd."
4,in a pinch,This book served me in a pinch as the newest edition was vastly more expensive. I found it to be very informational.
4,"Sadly, these are no longer oil-free...","Unfortunately for us ""Engine 2 Diet"" fans, the ingredients list has changed on these chips as of September 2009, and they now contain expeller pressed (canola, safflower or sunflower) oil. I hope to save someone else the mistake I just made in buying a pack of 12.Fortunately I don't have pre-existing heart disease that I know of, but if you're strictly following Dr. Caldwell Esselstyn's program in ""Prevent and Reverse Heart Disease: The Revolutionary, Scientifically Proven, Nutrition-Based Cure"", DON'T buy these chips, they're not what they used to be (which was just organic yellow corn and lime)."
4,"Not as anticipated, but I like them anyway.","Hi. I had to amend a previous review for this item because I only gave it 2 stars back in July 27, 2009.I've decided to give the chips another try, and after eating them for about a month now. I'm used to the taste now. Because of a few health issues I had to change my entire diet around by incorporating more low sodium or salt free items. I've noticed that since doing this I can actually taste the flavor in these chips. I can taste the corn and it's really good. I also like eating them with homemade salsa. That gives them a extra bit of kick while adding flavor and texture.So since I couldn't adjust my star rating from 2 to 4 I just deleted my previous comment altogether. These aren't for people who are use to a ton of sodium in their snack treats, but give them a chance and help your heart while you're doing this."
3,Great for the dieter that must have their chips.,"My only complaint is that I wish they did not break so easy. I eat a lot of beans and rice, with salsa and they break a little too easy, other than that, exactly what I thought they would be, a not so bad for you chip."
2,I don't like this game...,"I recently tracked down this game b/c I began to REALLY like Shining Force, but this game was lacking, to say the least.....Final Fantasy 1 is better than this. Everything in the game from what I can tell, is one big labyrinth which was confusing. I'm a old school gamer, and have been playing games for about 20 yrs or so. the lousy graphics I don't mind.....the story line isn't bad. I just don't like the total labyrinth feel. Everything is shown in a third person view (ie like Dune or something) and I don't think there is a way to change that. the battles are boring and don't seem to require much strategy or thought. So, in case you can't get my idea of this review..........it is, don't waste your money and if U like a game like this, go with Shining Force 1-3, but not this prequel"
3,looks pretty good,"looks good, I know it is old, my granndson wanted it, Hope it works , good to get yje cover included"
3,Nothing special,I got this at a thrift store for i think only a buck maybe more. But it was still pretty cheap......... The game is basiclly a old school dungeon crawler like that wizardy game my brother used to love. The art is in anime style... Much better then any NES game. Other then that there really is not anything special about this game.
5,Must have for any car owner,"I have read this from cover to cover and am so amazed at how Mr. Robertson has made it a dream instead of a nightmare to own a car. I recommend anyone who owns a car, to buy this book."
1,unrealistic sex,This book was so irritating. I can't believe you all read the same book I read. Seriously the whole book was un realistic. No man falls in love with woman who pays for sex. Then the part where she talks about having protection to protect herself then she goes down on him.. Hello sexual transmitted diseases are not only only for the genital areas. I seriously started skipping through just to get to the end of the book. This was seriously a porn disguised as a romance novel.. I swear there should be a section for romance books and sex books.
1,worst carly phillips ever,"I cannot believe the reviews. Carly is one of my favorite writers and I bought this book with great anticipation, I was so disappointed. the plot is stale, the dialog is really corny and the characters are boring. Halfway thru the book, I didn't even want to finish but continued on. Didn't get any better"
5,The best ever made,This is the best tape measure ever made. I have been a concrete contractor since 1973 and have owned nearly all tape measures made in these many years. The white background sets this tape apart for ease of reading and the overall build quality is top notch. It is comfortable in the hand and will take a tremendous beating. I have bought many of these tapes just to give to friends and each and every time they tell me these are the best they have ever had. I buy the 30 foot model and have never had a retraction issue like in all other over 25 foot tapes. The cost doesn't really matter as these will last for as long as you take decent care of them. Just try one
2,no warrantee,I like the rubber cover but they only last about 2 months for a contractor because the blade tears and they don't offer replacement blades or a warrantee. I now buy Sears or Home Depot Husky asthey warrantee for life.
5,A good supplement to the text,I'm using this book with my daughter. The exercises fit the lessons. The book even contains exercises on non-Latin topics like derivatives and Roman numerals. The text itself is quite good: lessons are of a manageable size and the editors wisely have not tried to teach more than one or two points per lesson.
1,this author should be ashamed of himself.,"I started reading ""Just Jackie"" with some trepidation. I was afraid it would be a typically trashy tabloid reliving of the later life of Jackie Kennedy. But I was somewhat impressed with Klein's credentials - and actually, I was so taken with the beautiful photo of Jackie on the cover, i wanted to give it a try. But I was so offended by this book, I never finished it. Without grossly offending innocent readers of this review, i will say only that Klein includes a mind-bogglingly detailed description of the disinterment of the bodies of Jackie's two stillborn children. Yes, you read that right. I never thought I'd feel sorry for jackie Kennedy, who always seemed strong enough to deal with her life. But I am now desperately sorry for her, and for her two surviving children. This is outrageous, and Klein and his publishers should be ashamed of themselves. (Too bad there is no provision for ""no stars."")"
1,Disappointed,"I was very disappointed in this book. I have read books about the Kennedy family since I was a child, and I am familiar with a lot of the historical incidents. Some of the book was not historically accurate - I don't believe Jackie was at the funeral of Patrick, and the author skipped her job at Viking Press. Also, the writing was choppy, and the chapters seemed to end abruptly. In fact, the book ended with her death, and it seems as if he forgot to finish it. The book appeared to be written in a hurry, with very little continuity or accuracy. I was very disappointed that I wasted my time reading this book."
1,"Oh, how low can Ed Klein descend?","If you're interested in reading about Mrs. Onassis' menstrual cycle, which parts of President Kennedy's body she massaged after his death, the disinterrment of her dead children's bodies, well...get your kicks from reading the Starr report instead...This book is based on gossip, attributing stories and quotes to people who are dead and can neither refute nor verify them and is an insidious attempt to cash in on Mrs. Onassis' life.Shame on you Ed Klein."
1,"How do you spell ""trash""","Never have I read a biography of anyone who was trashed so much as Jackie was in this book. I've only read 6 chapters, and I doubt I'll pick it up to attempt the 7th, but what I read was hearsay, quotes from people who probably weren't her friends (wannabees, maybe from years ago) and I'll bet a lot of speculation. Sure some of what he wrote may be true, but does it have to be detailed to titilate us just enough to let our imaginations go down the wrong road?About the only positive thing I got out of this book was the way he was able to get me to really feel Jackie's pain -- from her husband's death, her fear of the future and shabby treatment from ""friends"" and peers. I hurt for her 36 years later for this pain and for continued shabby treatment by this author."
1,Just Jackie,Edward Klein is the author of another Kennedy book titled Jack and Jackie: A Love Story. I found his first book too focused on scandals....many of which were not well documented. When I received this book and immediately realized that is was by the same author I was very disappointed. If you are looking for an interesting read on Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis' later years I would suggest Reading Jackie.
3,"Interesting, but not riveting!","Edward Klein delivers another predictable Jackie tome. However he does miss one very major point, Aristotle started courting Jackie before the assassination of JFK. This documented in another new book Oh, No...Jackie-O! by January Jones available on amazon.com. This book tells us of a new theory which intially shocks but eventually convinced me that there was much more to the Ari-Jackie connection then we have been told."
2,Is that all there is?,"Nothing new here. Klein repeats all the same stories, tales, and fables we have read elsewhere before, throws in a few new ones based on unnamed sources in a workaday prose that does little to illuminate the former first lady. Kitty Kelly and C. David Heymann topped the field in their marvelous tomes on Jackie. Klein and Chris Anderson are wannabees. The photographs, however, are good but only because Jackie is still one of the world's most beautiful women."
1,Horrible,"I don't mind it when people shatter a facade. Only as long as it's true. This book holds no credibility. When Klein claims he was an acquaintence with Jackie, I think that means he picked up something she dropped once. Another thing that seems suspicious is that Klein keeps writing books about the Kennedys. How many times can you write about the same subject? Get a life, Klein."
4,An eye-opening account of the former First Lady,"This book cuts through all of the garbage and gushing over Jackie K. O. This book covers from the asassination to her death, how she coped, how she lived and the people she chose to surround herself with. An honest account of her life told through friends, protective agents and family members."
4,These are THE BEST Bibs I have found.,"These are truly stain and mildew resistant. They have pockets on the backsides so you can either flip the pocket around or wear the bib backwards if you want pockets (I never understood why they didn't just put the pockets on the front side, they are clear, so they don't affect seeing the cute designs)These wash more easily than any of my other bibs, plastic, fabric, or even those stupid super-bibs (which mold and let liquids through, like juice)The velcro stays on. The neckholes are just the right size. I have had them for about 4 months and they are the ones that we reach for first. If they weren't so pricey they would get 5 stars!"
2,bad recording,"Officer Eddie Morales gives you a exellent overview of the basic of an police officer procedures on self defense,arrest etc.Unfortunately the way the dvd was recorded is the worst it cuts off momentarily,somentimes the sound goes out."
5,Very Consistent Results - Highly Recommended,"This Powder Measure came with my Lyman reloading press set and it has proven to provide amazingly consistent measures. We installed this into a free a space on my press using the included adapter, but it also has an integrated clamp that can be directly attached to a tabletop for standalone use. Figuring out how to set the unit to dispense the correct amount of powder was fairly confusing reading the directions, but it was actually straight forward once we started to play with the controls.I am very pleased with how well this works!Highly Recommended!CFH"
4,Powder Measure,Set it up for loading my 30-06. Took awhile but it seems to be very consistant in dispensing the powder I use. Will see how it goes when I load a larger batch of ammo. The quality of the unit is very good and seems like it will last for years.
3,"good stories, but no tour book of Havana","While some readers disliked that the two plots never intersected, I didn't mind that. Both were excellent, suspenseful crime stories.What did bother me was the minor errors in the Havana portion. The practitioners of the religion brought to Cuba by Yorubas are called ""santeros,"" not ""santerias."" ""Santeria"" is the name of the religion. I was in La Floridita in November 2000, and it didn't resemble the description in the book. It is my understanding that the bar -- basically, a shrine to Ernest Hemingway -- is unchanged from the 1940s. There were some other faulty descriptions. It's as if Kaminsky's never been to Cuba but got muddled descriptions second-hand. It makes me wonder how true to life his Russia is."
1,Too bright and seller never even responded to my issue.,"For one the liner was too bright, no problem because it would have worked for a friend. However, there was an issue with the shipping and product and the seller never even bothered to respond to me. I was disappointed all the way around on this one."
3,Burts...,"I have two of these lip balms and I'm not completely crazy about them. I've used their mint lip balm and the honey lip balm, and I really love them, so I was expecting these to be more of the same, except colorful. Wrong. I was impressed with how much color these actually impart (be careful if you're shy of color!) and they go on with the familiar minty tingle, but there's no shimmer to speak of, and after a while you lose all moisture in your lips. I find myself reaching for a proper lip balm to compensate, and rubbing all the color off."
4,Tingly...,"i love the pepperminty tingle my lips have after i use this. The color is a bit light for my taste, but not bad. i am hoping to pick up a darker shade soon."
3,Burt's Bees is the Best,"Burt's Bees Lip Shimmer is the best lip shimmer on the market. I don't particularly like the Papaya color, but the it is still scrumptious. I like that it provides coverage for those dry winter lips and yet provides enough color to your lips unlike other lip balms. The only funny thing about the shipment I received was the size of the box. There were three of these small tubes in this huge box. They could have sent them in a padded envelope."
5,Delightful to use or give as gift,"We order these by the boxes - so as not to run out of our favorite shades. They make delightful gifts, stocking stuffers, and to place in gift baskets for shelters or food banks. Just a wonderful perpperminty feel with nontoxic ingredients and flattering colors. Cheap! Great invention."
3,shimmer be gone,"I normally love Burt's Bees products,but this one wasn't quite what I had expected. It almost has a slight pearlized look,which is fine if you're under 25(I'm not}. I guess I just expected it to be shiny. ""Shimmer"" in the product name should have clued me in,but I guess I wasn't paying attention. To be fair,It's only SLIGHTLY shimmery/pearly. The color(sans shimmer) is nice as is the feel(very moisturizing). I wish they made it without the shimmer."
2,Burts misses on this one,"I really like BB products, but this one falls flat. the rounded shape of the balm makes it awkward to stay within the 'lines' of my lips. I twisted out a bit too much, and then couldn't twist it back in and ended up pretty much wasting the whole tube. It certainly feels nice, but I think you should stick with the lip glosses. Those are better."
1,book was in good shape,"the book was in good shape, but i must admit my bias, i hated this book and sociology in general"
5,Great cutters,"The Dremel 326D 6-Piece High Speed Cutter Set is a good addition to your Dremel bit collection and works like a charm.If you are into wood working and need some great bits, buy them here."
1,They are NOT in stock,"DO NOT BELIEVE THE IN STOCK NUMBERS OR ANYTHING FROM ACE PHOTO DIGITAL.I ordered this and one other item on December 12. They listed the ship by date as Dec 14-15, with delivery between Dec 17th and Dec 22nd. On Dec 20th, too late to order from elsewhere, they informed me it was backordered and cancelled my order, so that I could not even leave feedback. They still show as having them in stock on Amazon a day after informing me they are backordered.The two products I had ordered from this company were both handled in this manner. I would advise you to find a different company to order from."
5,great,Had the cd before but something happen to it was glade to find it again love the whole cd.I listen to it all the time
2,"IF A MASTERPIECE, THEN A MICROMINIATURE ONE - MAYBE...","this is a quirky record, and uncharacteristically dark for its time. describing the album as dark in a velvetish or zappa-like way (as some have suggested) however accords ""microminiature love"" a status it doesn`t deserve:""boy in the sandbox"" is a fine psychedelic period piece, with inventive guitar abstractions reminiscent maybe of fifty foot hose (whose only album is a masterpiece in this writer`s view). however, that`s where the distinctiveness of this album ends: playing seven slightly differing versions of ""boy in the sandbox"" (in the same key, too!) a long-lost psychedelic masterpiece does not make.forgive me therefore if I suggest taking an earful of this album in 30 second bites at amazon before investing your hard-earned cash, proceed via a download of ""boy in the sandbox"", say, and then opt instead for a cd re-release of fifty foot hose, randy holden (population ll) or similar for superior listening pleasure..."
4,"Nice, large print","It is always hard to guess how big the Bible will be and how big the lettering, but my husband loved this Bible. It is a little large for me to carry but is fine for him. The print is great. I don't need my glasses to read them. He wears his glasses all the time anyway, but this keeps him from straining his eyes at all. Beautiful, too."
1,Text from reverse page bleeds through terribly.,"The paper is so thin that the text from the reverse page bleeds through terribly, making the text very difficult to read. The maps are better quality, but I didn't buy it for the maps. If I cannot read the text easily, it completely defeats the purpose of a Giant Print bible. I would normally be forgiving and offered at least 2 or 3 stars, but the fundamental purpose of the book is compromised with this thin paper, so I cannot give it any more than 1 star. Given that many people gave it very good reviews, I believe the paper theirs was printed on is thicker, because it is not something that one would not notice.I'm returning mine."
3,NASB Giant Print Bible,"I absolutely love the large print and leather. I also like NAS version, but in the front of the Bible at Genesis it is pulling away from the rest of the bible slightly. I had already thrown the box and receipt away so it wasn't worth dealing with"
5,Found my perfect bible!,"This is a bible with font size 14. It is a 2-column verse by verse bible. It has end-verse references. The font type and size made the text very readable. The text is well-spaced. The words of Christ is in dark maroon colour. There is some ghosting but I still find it acceptable. At the end of the bible, there is a Dictionary cum Concordance and Thesaurus. I find this very useful. There are also short introductions to books of the bible, God's promises, Where to find help, Verses for reflection and 8 coloured maps at the back of the bible. Size of the bible is around 9.6""-7""-1.6"". Printed in China.I love to use this bible to meditate and memorise bible verses. It may not be the perfect bible for everyone but it is definitely the PERFECT bible for ME!!"
5,Excellent Bible,"Like every previous review, I am very happy with this bible: printing quality, font size and packing, everything is perfect. We have brought Good News Bible, King James, New King James, NIV, and this is the best one and our favorite one."
2,Wiseguy gives you the Shaft,"We started watching Wiseguy on Netflix when season 1 became available because I loved the show when it was in Primetime. Even though the cell phones are humongous and the cars are dated, the show had enough intrigue to make it viable entertainment today.After the Netflix vein petered out, we looked around for a way to continue the Wiseguy experience and here comes the ""Collector's Edition"" with ""Seasons 1 - 4."" Perfect!EXCEPT: They fail to mention that the Dead Dog Records arc was completely removed.EXCEPT: The disk quality is so dismal that sections of the videos as long as 20 minutes are UNWATCHABLE.I have debated returning the entire mess to Amazon, but keep trudging on because I am such a fan of the show. It's too bad that after 20 years, they didn't take the time or spend the cash to do it right.Disappointed Fan,Richard"
3,Lazy opening credits,"I just got my set today and in addition to the missing Dead Dog episodes and the substituted music, I notice some of the opening credits don't match the arc they're attached to. For instance, the opening credits during the Lynchboro arc are the credits from the Turf Wars arc. And the opening credits on the last three episodes of the series (when Michael Santana moves to NYC) are from the earlier Santana arc, and feature Guzman.Overall I'm happy with the set because it means I can toss out my crappy old VHS tapes that featured the syndicated episodes. But still, I'd pay good money for a true, complete set: all the episodes, with original music and correct opening credits."
2,missing disk,"Warning: Season 2, Disk 4 was missing. By the time I realized the whole music industry arc was not in the set, it was too late to return it."
2,Disappointed,"This is supposed to have complete series. There are 8 episodes missing. They say 67 is the series,but 75 is the whole series. What happened to the missing 8."
3,Wow............am I bummed,"I loved the show when it came out and literally watched 4 or 5 DVD's back to back and loved it. As it had been years since I had seen it, I was not sure of the sequence, and it seemed strange to me that Amber (Patti D'Arbanville)pops up in the storyline without her husband Isaac Twine (Paul Winfield)and I watch a few more still thinking something is wrong. I go on Wikipedia where they have all the seasons listed and it hits me. I go back to amazon and read the reviews and realize I've been had just like all the rest of those that bought the collectors edition. Wouldn't you think that you'd get ALL of the episodes buying something titled as such!I feel pretty ripped off...........let the buyer beware."
2,Incomplete series episodes missing in the middle,"This is a Millcreek release and for some reason they left out some of the episodes that followed the Dead Dog Records story line. It is still good and to be honest it wasn't my favorite of the story lines, however it does leave gaps in the whole story example suddenly this woman with references to a past is part of the story except that the episodes that are part of that past are missing."
1,Defective product,Wise Guy-this is the second time I purchased the Wise Guy series and it was defective in the same spot-episode 5 in season 1-I will probably try one more time
1,"No Nights, No Dead Dog, No Buy","I have one of the original DVDs of the Steelgrave & Profit arcs. I definitely missed Nights in White Satin and the significance of the song at that point in the story. I have been waiting for the Dead Dog Records arc - patiently, waiting. Now, we have ""the complete series"" with no Dead Dog Records????What's the deal? I know there are litigations, but the money that would be made by selling the REAL COMPLETE SERIES would help pay for the music fees, artist fees, etc. If the artists won't agree - they were already paid when they appeared on the show, then let the fans know. Then we will really let THEM know how we feel.This is ridiculous. Thank you other reviewers for letting us know that we would be short changed again - no Nights in White Satin (which is a fabulous song and even better when the Moodies perform in concert) and no Dead Dog Records Arc. Why buy it?"
1,cheapskates,"I would buy this in a heartbeat if it had the original music and all the episodes.I'd gladly pay the increased cost. The music is part of the art, but multinational corporations don't appreciate art -- just commerce. And they underestimate us, disrespect us, thinking we will buy it regardless.I hope no one buys this..."
1,It's A Crime,"How many more versions of 'Wiseguy' have to come out on DVD before we get the whole thing, Mr. Cannell? And what's worse, how many people are going to buy this set thinking it is the complete run of 'Wiseguy'? The Dead Dog arc was brilliant, but they say it won't be in this collection, presumably because they would have to pay Debbie Harry for the rights to use her song. So now do we not only miss out on Debbie Harry, but also Glenn Frey, Tim Curry, Patti D'Arbanville, Mick Fleetwood, Paul Winfield and more...This stinks."
3,"Limitations, but better than not having any Wiseguy!","I know that not clearing 'Nights in White Satin' for inclusion on Season 1 was a 'travesty', and not having the immortal Glenn Frey's arc not included is annoying, but c'mon, there's NO chance that Wiseguy gets any re-releases in the future whatsoever with cleared music, so lets enjoy the show, and try and forget the limitations of the set."
2,Be Warned - Season 2 Not Complete,"Buyer Beware. Yes, this ""Collectors Edition"" is missing 7 episodes from Season 2, the complete ""The Dead Dog Records"" storyline [Season 2, episodes 13-19]. While it's lousy that the omission is not clearly spelled out and calling it a ""Collectors Edition"" is misleading, at least I'll enjoy what there is of the 4 seasons."
1,dissapointing in mfg,i had to send it back twice because on both copies the first or second disc would not play right. i gave up when i had to seb the second one back
1,NO STARS,MILL CREEK REALLY DROPPED THE BALL ON THIS. I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT WOULD HAVE COST TO GET THE REST OF THE EPISODES BUT THEY SHOULD HAVE PAID IT. I WON'T SPEND A DIME IF IT IS NOT COMPLETE. THANKS FOR REFUNDING MY MONEY AMAZON!!!
3,Wiseguy,Not the full 4 year version. Missing the music Arc (Glenn Frey). Gaps due to this. No explanation.
4,another missing epIsode,"nice collection great price. just realized there is a missing episode besides the Dead Dog Arc (7 episodes) An episode from season 3 (People do it all the time ) is also missing. 67 episodes on set. , missing 8. Why was season 3 episode not includsed?"
1,Screw MillCreek,"I am so offended by this companies mistreatment of this great show,words fail me. Such a rip-off!! I bought the first season when it came out and I was astounded at the omission of crucial music.Screw this company!! Don't buy this rip-off!!"
1,all around bad product,"I was really looking forward to this release, unfortunatly the discs are defective and their are missing episodes. I wish i had read the reviews on amazon before buying this product."
3,Get what you pay for,"This was the crappiest packaging I have ever seen. The price can't be beat but please have a little pride in your product. Other reviewers commented about missing episodes so I expected that, but this whole marketing endeavor was sub standard. Shame on Hollywood again! If you like Wiseguy I guess this is the best you are going to get....at least it came cheap."
3,Missing Episodes in Wiseguy: The Collector's Edition (DVD),The following episodes are missing in the Wiseguy: The Collector's Edition (DVD):Season 2-Dead Dog LivesSeason 2-And It Comes Out HereSeason 2-The Rip-Off StichSeason 2-High Dollar BopSeason 2-Hip Hop On The Gravy TrainSeason 2-The One That Got AwaySeason 2-Living and Dying in 4/4 TimeSeason 3-People Do It All The Time
3,disappointed,"if you are buying this title it is because you have fond memories from back in the day.You will not be disappointed if you are looking for the Mel Profitt arc. BUT, if you want to see the music industry stories known as the ""Dead Dog"" arc, you will be. There is no Debbie Harry or Glenn Frey. NO Tim Curry.The ""Collector's Edition"" is not complete.I enjoyed the set up until I came to an episode that began with McPike telling Vinnie that the case was over. This was a total buzzkill."
2,SO DISAPPOINTED WITH THIS COLLECTORS EDITIONS,"I was so excited when I saw this collector edition was coming out for all 4 seasons. Only to find out that the arc I wanted to see the most Dead Dog isn't there. You can keep ""Season 4"" what a waste and by the end of season 3 the writing changed dramatically. The full first season and Dead Dog was really what made Wiseguy so great. wish I had seen these other reviews before I bought this."
1,Agreed...won't buy until all episodes (all story arcs) are included,"I really WANT to buy this collection. Just watched all of season 1 over the last few weeks on [...] and was ready and willing to pony up some $$$ to get seasons 2-4, but I am extremely disappointed (but relieved that others let me know in the reviews here) to hear that the Dead Dog Records arc and original scores are not in this ""Collector's Edition"" package. I will not buy this--and hope that, even though it will mean spending more money, that someday a real Collector's Edition will be released. You will then have my business, and good word of mouth to recommend a purchase to others.Give us all of the episodes, PLEASE!"
2,Wiseguy fans! Stand up for your Dead Dog Arc!!,"Hey Mill Creek Entertainment! Cough up the bucks and put the Dead Dog Arc episodes on DVD!LIKE THIS FACEBOOK PAGE:[...]Somewhere between the ""White Noise"" and ""Call It Casaba"" episodes in Season II of the Wiseguy series, there was an awesome and viewer-favorite sequence of episodes called the ""Dead Dog Arc."" Unfortunately, these episodes have not made it to DVD because the music rights would be too expensive. So, like the Steelgrave arc finale, where Nights in White Satin was stripped from one of the greatest scenes in TV history for the sake of saving a few bucks, the Dead Dog arc episodes are not available."
1,The BEST Show ever on TV....STILL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I have begun watching these after so many years, and I cannot believehow INCREDIBLE these episodes are. I have ordered other series I missand I love them, but realize today they seem a bit slow or boring.This series could run, brand new, today and be a HIT!! The intrigue,the awesome cast, the plots, the evil ones, the action scenes, dialogue...FANTASTIC is an understatement! This is everything you remember and MORE!!"
2,Stick with what you love - The Sonny Steelgrave arc,"I bought the first arc of the series, the Sonny Steelgrave storyline, first because the full series was not available at that time. I was so thrilled with the first arc that I bought the full series when it became available. Unfortunately there was a reason I did not stay with the series when it actually aired all those years ago. As the series wears on the plots almost seem desperate. Vinnie Terranova never had the same class or charisma and I just felt sorry for him, like maybe he was looking for somewhere to go and could never get there. Stick with Sonny and company and you will not be disappointed, beyond that, watch at your own risk of disappointment. The upside is that the Steelgrave arc is with the set."
3,Partial Collectiopn,"Wiseguy the collectors set is not bad for the cost. There are 8 missing episodes Dead dog lives, And it comes out here, The rip off stick, High dollar Bop, Hip hop on the Gravy Train, The one that got away, Living and dying in 4/4/ time and People do it all the time. After waiting a long time to re-see the show it was disappointing to have it missing this many episodes. I hope somewhere in future they do release the complete series. It is still worth seeing."
5,Maple a powerfull tool,"This is an excellent book. It helps the beginners of ""Dynamical Systems"" to understand this branch of Mathematical Physics using Maple. It is very useful for undergraduate students as well as for teachers."
5,great tool for grooming dogs' nails!,"I bought this tool to use on my greyhounds ""talons"". She won't let anyone near her with traditional nail clippers, and the dremel is a wonderful solution. The rotating sanding belt takes off just a little of the edge of the nail at a time, so there is very little risk of injuring the dog. We have used the dremel about 5 times in the past month, and have not had to change out the first sanding belt yet. The longest I have used the tool in one sitting was about 1/2 an hour, and the battery lasted that long. I recommend this tool for dog owners who have similar troubles with nail grooming."
5,Great for the dog,I wanted something to use on my dog so we didn't have to put him out everytime he needed his nails done. He was a bit hesitant at first because of the sound and just past issues with his nails. We've used it twice now and he just lays down and let's us do his nails. Beats having the vet put him out and do his nails for $60.
4,Works well,"I bought this item to trim my dog's toenails, but he won't let me do it.....however.....my husband thinks it's the best thing since sliced bread for him to trim his own toe nails."
2,Dissapointing,This product is very dissapointing. I charge it for three hours and get maybe 8 mins of grinding from it. To finish a job I would need to have a least 10 charged batteries all the time.Dremel 750-02 Minimite 4.8-Volt Two-Speed Cordless Rotary Tool
3,"Dremel Minimite 4.8 Volt, Two-speed Corldess Rotary Tool","Great tool except, needs about 3 hours on a charge and charge doesnt last any longer than an hour. If your planning on using this item extensively, i would suggest getting a corded one. Other than that really good."
4,Great for My Use,"My dog's breeder recommended this model to use for keeping the dog's nails trimmed. Absolutely perfect for filing down her nails. I always put on a pair of gardening gloves (you know how puppies and dogs wiggle) and this cordless wonder works GREAT. Good price, great work. A very good buy."
3,Use until other is charged,"Has very little power. Was just something to use until i learned of the 10.8 Volt. Now I cannot WAIT TO GET THE NEW 12VOLT for XMas. It will be SO GREAT to have 2set, ready to go the two bits you needs, rather than changing Collets Each time.I purchased the Kit with 2 batteries, the 21.99 bit kit & Collet set for both my Brothers..I just may get the SAME for my Dad,!My one brother said he felt like McGuyver.Its a really great handy instument to have.One you start using it, you'll wonder what took you so long to finally get it!!"
2,Dremel 4.8 Volt Cordless,I bought this a few years ago and used it a few times (less than a dozen small tasks). I charged the battery and it gave out after only a few seconds. Just couldn't hold a charge - and this is when I really needed it since I left the plugged in version a long way away and only had this one. I charged it again for a few hours and it gave me a few seconds of power before petering out. I will never depend upon this unit again but don't have the heart to throw it away. It seems valuable but the battery is the weak point. I will look for a power adapter but then it will lose its usefulness as being cordless. The whole reason I bought it in the first place.
2,charged battery?,"I bought this to do my dog's nails. The battery lasts about 10 minutes. Not enough to do my 3 dogs on the same day. Also, I took the battery off of the charger and was unable to do nails at that time. I went to do them the next day and the battery was dead. The only reason it gets as high a rating as 2 stars is that it fits in my hand really well."
3,Battery and charger problems,"The tool works fine, but the battery life is too short for most projects and it takes a long time to recharge. The second problem is that the battery does not sit in the charger correctly, so unless you're careful and make sure the green light is on before you walk away, you may come back to find an uncharged battery. I use this tool to file my dog's nails, but the battery usually dies on me after two paws, then I have to recharge, come back and do the other two paws the next day. If I had to guestimate, I'd say that a charge doesn't last longer than 10-15 minutes. It's a real PITA. Unless Dremel has made huge improvements where their batteries are concerned, I would recommend a corded tool."
2,Bad Battery or Recharger,"This is the second Dremel I've owned and they both stopped recharging after about a year. The first one was replaced under warranty, and the second one is going back today. They work well, but they don't seem to use quality batteries or rechargers, so keep your receipt and be prepared to send it back when it stops working."
1,I should have invested in a serious tool,"This is a great tool to have, for about 6 months. Then the battery charge that was giving you 15-20 minutes is giving you 5-10. I have three dogs now and it's a big hassle to have to divide up the nail grinding event over several days when it can be done all at one time. I'm on my third Dremel Minimite now!!! I could have purchased a very substantial handheld tool with the money I've invested in Dremel... I can't even figure out where to find replacement batteries to purchase.So, it's a good tool for a while, but be prepared to purchase it again and again, especially if you have multiple mutts :)"
3,dremel 750-02,"I bought this product mainly for the purpose of trimming my 45lb dogs nails. I found this product to work only ""ok"" For those who will use this on medium to large size dogs I would suggest you go for something a little more powerful.The Dremel tools are great for trimming pet's nails. I just should have purchased a more powerful one."
1,Didn't work,"I was waiting in eager anticipation for this product to arrive...boy was I disappointed when it did. First of all, it feels and looks cheap. I immediately charge the battery since by dogs are in dire need of a nail trimming and this is basically why I bought this tool. After inserting the battery, I turn the setting to ""lO"" and realized this was way too slow so I switched over to the ""HI"" setting and nothing...it would not even rotate. I thought perhaps I did not move the cheap feeling switch over far enough but I could not move it over any farther. I than took out the battery and reinserted it into the body and it turned on for a brief second. I realized that it would not turn on unless I had my hand pressing the bottom of the battery to make good contact! I'm in the process of returning it and will now order a Proxxon which I stumbled upon researching for another dremel. Do yourself a favor and spend the extra bucks on something else.Extremely disappointed,TKM"
3,"Dremel 750-02 Minimite 13,000 RPM 2 Speed 4.8-Volt Cordless Rotary Tool","Purchased primarily to file dog's claws e.g. to shorten them so they don't become too long. Dog is long-haired and despite my efforts to trim hair in the vicinity of his paws, it seems as if I'd have to trim his legs an inch or more to avoid the hair becoming entangled in the rotating device. Neither he nor I enjoy that! Am hesitant about continuing to use it. About ready to revert back to the hand-operated claw trimer formerly used."
2,Stops working over time,"This tool was great at first. Unfortunately, the battery gradually stops holding a charge, and becomes too weak to be used for even a few minutes. The battery on my unit also began leaking and it corroded the connections in the motor section just after the warranty expired. I would recommend buying a more powerful and better made dremel, even if you intend to use it for dog nail trimming, with the hope that it will last longer.While it still worked, I found it very useful, and my dog liked it better than the nail clippers. It was also easier to trim dark colored nails without cutting the nail's quick."
5,awesome purchase!!,"i bought this for dogs nails, which it is AMAZING for but have already found a million uses that i had no idea i needed it for. replacement sanding disks are readily available at home depot and very inexpensive.i highly recommend this versatile product. The battery has great charge life as well which is a real plus!"
5,Great!,I use this for my dogs' nails. They don't freak out like they do with clippers and its SO much easier to use! It also gets them alot shorter and they aren't still sharp like with clippers! But sometimes shavings of the nail can fly off into your eye so wear saftey glasses or even just plain glasses.
4,Perfect dog nail grinder,"I use the Dremel Minimite for my dog's nails. I was worried at first that there wasnt going to be enough power for my dog's big nails, but the dremel definitely came through. Its pretty quiet so my pup doesnt get scared away when I turn it on either. The battery is the only drawback, although it gets us through a few grinding sessions before having to recharge. A great purchase!!"
2,Not a specific tool for paws,"When I was looking for a dog nail clipper this tool came up as recommend nail clipper. It is a standard Dremel tool with a sanding disc. I expected to have some instructions explaining how to perform the dogs nail grooming. Nothing was in the literature. Baiscally, you still have to clip the nails with a dog clipper and then you can clean them up with this tool"
1,Item not as pictured,Careful...I bought this unit as my old one died....but I had two spare square battery packs and a charger that still worked....I bought this based on the picture and number 750D....what I got was the newer version 750-02 and my old square battery packs do not fit.
2,"Wow, I'm pretty sure we have enough reviews about use for dogs. Does it work for what it was made for?","I'm glad it works for your dog's nails, but that only needs to be mentioned a few times. What about uses as a real tool? Does it work for random household things? Have you tried it with a cutting wheel, and if so does it cut a variety of things with relative ease?"
1,Just for the Buck,I couldn't review this item since it wasn't up long enough for me to buy it. In the cart went back to buy and the price jumps 60%. WOW what cutomer service! This isn't the first time I have had Amazon jump the price just to make a buck.
2,Item Ordered Not Received,"Tools and Hardware. I cannot give this item a good review because I did not receie it. It was returned to Amazon with the notification on it as ""Undeliverable"". I live in a Senior Citizens Retirement Community. From an investigation by the Community management it was revealed that the shipper was DHL. Since I was not at home they did not deliver this item but instead returned it to Amazon, the sender as being undeliverable. Umderstand that this is not the first time that DHL has done this with shipments.Respectrfuly, Bernard Bland, Jr. in Springfield, VA"
4,Very happy!,I do artificial gel nails for a living and love this cordless drill! The battery lasts just about the whole day but having a fully charged back up battery is a must. I've been using one for over 5 years now and purchased this one as a back up in case my old one shuts down. Price was good too!!!
4,Good for dog nails but messy,"A bought this to grind the dog's nails. They seem to tolerate it better than conventional clippers but you have to be very careful to rotate what nail you are doing so it doesn't get to hot and whatever you are working by will be covered with ""nail dust"" by the time you are done. On high speed the battery doesn't quite make it at full power to the end of the trimming but it continues on a bit slower to finish the job. BTW, for reference, I have a big German Shepherd so his nails might be a bit more than most people use it for. He lets me actually trim his nails (with much enticement) so all in all it's a win for the Dremel - easy to recharge too!"
5,Dremel Dogs,"I love the dremel! I use it to dremel the black nails of my two small dogs. My youngest one has never let anyone get near her nails so I had to work with her more with the dremel. When I was done, her nails were so short and smooth. She had really long nails that she would trip all the time. My oldest dog doesn't mind the dremel at all and just falls asleep while I dremel away. I can never be afraid of getting the quick and with the dremel is way easy to tell when you are getting near and should stop. No blood, shorter nails, and smooth. [...]"
5,this is a keeper,low noise level! Does not scare our 2 German Shepherds! With regular bi-weekly sandings battery needs charging between dogs.A BONUS!...I have artifical nails and the second time I do my nails (needing 1 charge only) I weekly keep nails a nice keyboard length within 5 minutes!...I also recommend the extra $$$ for the extra 52 pc. accessory kit. I open those darn plastic packages that even kitchen shears are hard to cut thru and I've even cut easily thru chicken wire for the garden fence...I've even used it to lightly sand abrasions on the back of my high heals (leather).I keep this in my pantry! Without a doubt it comes in handy and I'll find a lot more use for it!A definate 5 stars!
2,Inferior Battery Pack,"I've been using Dremel rotary tools for over 25 years and they're hard to beat. The 4.8V MiniMite, however, is a disappointment. While like the safety of the slower speeds, the battery pack has never held a charge unless it's kept in the charger. Unplug it for a few days and it's dead and useless."
3,Works as advertised,The Dremel tool works just as advertised. Shipment was on time price was less than list.
5,Great dog nail trimmer,"Love this little dremel! Sometimes I use the high speed, sometimes the low speed, but my dogs have never had nails that are so short or so soft. I've used the Pedipaws, but it doesn't have enough power to get my big standard poodle's heavy black nails. This works great, hopefully I'll be able to work the quicks shorter by using it frequently. The best thing is that my dog doesn't mind having it done. A few treats and they're begging to have their nails done."
5,Drenel 750-02,"Love it use it on my pets nails does a wonderful job , eliminates risk of injury to my pet which gives me peace of mind. Should have gotten it sooner not to mention the other multiple uses which are just as wonderful."
4,Better than Clippers ....,"I got this product for my 9 year old husky/collie. Historically she's been an awful recipient of my attempts of animal pedicures.With this product I was able to get her nails down to a respectable length without causing damage to her or myself. I only did her front paws and once I started she was initially skittish but settled down and let me continue until finished. It's not a bad idea to wear glasses to protect your eyes from the debris, I also used a fan in the area."
2,"Hard to assemble, product breaks",I bought this to trim the nails of my dog. She has no problem having her nails ground but the first sanding disk broke on the first nail. It was then almost impossible to break. Now I will have to pay a fortune to get new sanding disks. No wonder Amazon is selling them so cheap.
2,Dogs Don't just LOVE Pedicures,"This item works okay, but the dog doesn't. Tried all the tricks and treats, but it takes a long time to file down long nails and she has no patience. My suggestion would be to use the old clippers for long claws and then see about maintaining them with this gadget. Not as exciting as the TV ads would claim and it's somewhat time consuming."
4,"Love this Dremel, just waiting for another use other than dog's nails!","My dog doesn't like having his nails clipped. After doing some research I came up with this dremel as it has two power speeds, is cordless, is rechargeable and is fairly light weight. I've since used it on our dog several times and it is quite effective. Having the ability to switch speeds when I am concerned that the nail is getting ""hot"" is excellent.I don't know how someone could say the battery life is short - I've left mine out for a couple of weeks only to pick it up and have it be just as effective. I only wish that it came with more of the standard bits so I am knocking off a point. In the meantime, I'm on the lookout for any project that I can use it on using one of those funky other sanding heads.""hot"""
5,one of my best purchases ever!,"I read most of the reviews on this item before deciding to purchase it and was still a bit skeptical, but I am so glad I ordered it. It works so great on my girls nails(4 cocker spaniels) and My terribly rough and sore heels. I really wondered about the reviews that said their dogs slept while they did their nails but they really do or at least my girls do, and my blond is usually scared to death of everything. They don't mind it at all, their nails are in great shape and so are my heels. I am addicted to wanting to use it. Don't hesitate to buy this item for your dogs nails and your heels,plus who knows what other great uses you can do with it, its worth it to me just for the two things I do with it. I just love it, and I am not usually one to write a reveiw unless it is really good, and it really is!"
2,I didn't realize how little power this Dremel would have..,"I bought this to use as a grinder, and it just not strong enough for even a small job. I just wanted a small, cordless grinder, but it's way too weak. Also, I don't think the battery has a long enough life. I would give the physical design a 4, pretty easy to grip and handle."
2,battery issues,"I bought this primarily to do the dog's nails after wearing out an old corded model. It worked beautifully for awhile, but within a few weeks the battery would not hold a charge. The company's customer service was fabulous. Within a week of returning the battery, I had received a new one. Unfortunately, I am having exactly the same problem after less than a year. I can't even get a single toe nail done before the device is out of juice. The second battery is going back this week. I expect that the good folks at Dremel will take care of this.Even though the cordless is handy, I wish I'd paid the extra money for the more reliable corded model."
4,Dremel Minimite Tool,I gave the dremel minimite to my husband as a gift. He seems pleased with it and it does the job that he wants done. It is light weight and simple to use. I purchased one a few years ago and had trouble with the battery not holding a charge but otherwise I liked it so I decided to try again. So far so good.
2,Spare Battery,"I had to do the same thing to this battery for my 20 year old Dremel Motor tool #750 as I did for the model #754 battery that I just got.Over the years, I bought rechargable batterie for this ""750"" unit and they fit and worked perfect. THEY WERE ""MADE IN U.S.A.""Lets start making stuff here at home.My second ""beef"" with Amazon is: You listed two of these batteries in stock for my 750 unit, so I bought both of them but you came back with a ""auto"" reply saying that I could only buy one..........DA ! DA ! DA !GOOD THINK I KNOW HOW TO RESHAPE THINGS SO THEY FIT !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Battery Pack,"Awfully expensive for 4 AA bateries! Tearing apart old pack, I discovered it comes apart relatively easily and batteries inside can be replaced for much less cost."
5,A must-have accessory for the Minimite,"The Dremel Minimite is a great tool for jobs away from AC power. Its single battery is good for most jobs; but, if the job goes into overtime (over 45 minutes of tool use), this extra battery is an absolute must. Rather than dealing with a dwindling battery at the end (and often most crucial part) of the job, pop in a replacement and finish with gusto!Off line, while charging one battery in the charger, the second battery convienently sits on top of the charger housing. Number them 1 & 2 to differentiate between the two and you've got a winning pair for any job in the field!"
1,Wrong Item,I returned this item because it would not fit my Dremel MiniMite 750. I returned it only to receive the same item as a replacement. I have returned it and I am still waiting for the correct battery replacement.
1,I returned this,The Dremel I like...but the battery did not fit into the dremel....what good is that??? I really can't even give it one star but it is the lowest I can go....
1,Bad Batteries,"I received the first battery ok. Unfortunately it was totally dead and would not take a charge. The company, Bic, sent a second battery which was also totally dead. So far I have not received an answer on the status of the second battery.Don Goodrumk4dbh@comcast.net"
1,Poor construction,The item was not constructed well. It seems to work but had to be taken apart and reassembled correctly. The case was one backward. I can not recommend this product.
5,Dremel Battery,"Perfect fit for my dremel and shipped really fast! Purchased to have backup battery and it was good investment for me,"
2,BROKEN!!!,"I was listening to these headphones for mabye 30 minutes, and then the left headphone died and doesn't work...Bad bad bad. hopefully skullcandy will replace it."
2,They are vastly overrated.,"I got these earphones becuase I heard that SkullCandy's were good, solid earphones and I wanted some quality over the ear phones, so when I found the $80 pair for $30, I was thrilled. I expected far too much out of them. After wearing them for 20 minutes I started to get a headache, they pinched the top of my head and were too heavy. They have virtually no bass at all and every time I take them off my hair gets trapped in them and it hurts. As far as sound quality as a whole goes, they're completely decent. I don't advise buying these, they're waste of money."
5,Awesome headphones!,My daughter absolutely loves these! My 17-year-old son says they have as much sound quality & power as the 50 mm headphones. We are very happy with them. Great price also!
4,Can You Hear Me Now?,"Hit the replay button on the tape deck for this amusing novel about an early-feminist in the radio business. KLIK is a must-read for young women who want an engaging example of how women tended to be regarded in the work place just a few decades ago. Schram brings such life to the characters one can't help but wonder how she fits in. Not only do you get a grasp of the behind-the-scenes at a San Francisco radio station, you get an entertaining read about how one young woman thrives by being true to herself."
5,STOP HATIN HE HOT FACE IT,Man why is every body hatin now and days u need to go head and give dude his props cause i do shout out to u ruka keep doin yo thang holdin down for tha lou its gone be hataz every where u go do trip one person cant make u are break u stay up ruka and lets gettin it poppin SUPREME TEAM holla
3,It's a cool cd but ya know,"I don't the dude(Ruka Puff) personally but I want to inform the little hater that wrote ""it's not worth it"" & how he wished he could give it a ""0""...Then I wanna ask one question, ""If it's so bad, why don't you come out with something better."" I hate when someone try to down someone when they can't do what this dude is trying to do. I think that Ruka Puff may go to places that Nelly can't even spell. So next time you try to dis on someone remember...""WHAT DO YOU DO, HAVE DONE, HAVE BEEN & WHERE ARE YOU GOING."" b/c I don't think you have been N-E WHERE this dude have been...Now the stars I gave towards it is b/c I have not heard the WHOLE cd but the beats are nice & circut city don't play the whole thing.

5,The Best CD Ever!,This Cd is the best one ever. Lift Me Up all ways lifts me up when I'm down and Look at me Rocks! I love all the songs and Geri Too!
2,"CD-Good, Rest of Stuff-Not Worth It","I bought this package hoping to get an extra length CD, with perhaps some NICE things with it. The video that is included is really just a waste of time. And I'm not saying all this because I hate the Spice Girls, and Geri, I'm actually a great fan of all of them. The key chain is cheaply made, and the poster isn't really a poster, it's about the size of a piece of paper. If you are looking into buying this, it's really not worth the extra money UNLESS you don't the Schizophonic album yet. It's probably the best thing you will get out of this."
5,Wow! I bought this the day it came out!,"All I can say is WOW! I mean I was a fan of the Spice Girls and I must say-Geri's solo CD is da bomb! The songs have great lyrics, with an edge! Great variety in the songs. A MUST BUY FOR ANYONE! It's so great!"
3,Blast from the past,The game was a great price and came in timely manner but the game itself was unplayable until I cleaned the contacts.
2,Arrived broken!,"My mom got this for my 2.5 year old son who loves Bob the Builder. The key fob arrived broken -- the batteries are in there, there's power going to the fob because the red light comes on brightly, but there's no audio. We've tried everything to fix it to no avail. The multi-tool is cute, but the ""magnifying glass"" is more of a kalidoscope. We can't return it because we clipped off all the plastic ties already. I think my son will continue to play with it, but it's certainly not what even the box described!"
2,Defined by Personality,"Graphics - 3/5Decent enough, but well below what the Genesis is capable of. Everything looks very flat and blatantly two-dimensional.Game Control - 2/5Feels very sluggish, needs 2 buttons to be held to attack, and is further limited by the Genesis controller. Your fingers will be very sore after a couple of levels.Gameplay - 3/5The epitome of a generic shooter, but it does feature a host of creative enemies.Story - 1/5Generally nonsensical unless you played the arcade version.Music - 1/5Very low quality stuff that sounds very generic. Completely forgettable.Overall Score = 2 / 5This one's for the Darius series fans only. Even fans of the shooter genre won't find too much to love here without having already fallen in love with later Darius games."
4,Pretty useful tool,"Bought this miniature router base because I needed to route some grooves in a tight space that my big ol' Sears router wouldn't fit into.The base screwed onto my older model Dremel just fine. There was a ""gotcha"", though: The Dremel's bit wasn't precisely centered in the base, so if you're using some kind of template to guide the router, you have to be aware of that and keep it in mind when designing your template.Worked fine, got my job done. Because the base is plastic, I was able to trim away part of it that interfered with my workpiece. The whole thing was definitely worth the money."
4,Good Cutting Guide,"This guide makes precision cutting possible and effortless. The guide is made of ABS plastic which is alright but may be prone to crack easily. The quality is pretty good. The only complaint I have is that the set screw for the depth adjuster has to be screwed very tight to keep the depth set. It also has a tendency to be a little crooked when extended, but can be adjusted to sit properly. Overall it is a good product and I would recommend it. It takes a little more finesse to get it just right than I would like, but I am happy with it."
3,could be better,the plastic guide is great. but the cutting bits lasted all of 3 secods in my wall. 3 out let boxes and all 3 used one bit each. fairly expensive and i still had to finish with a dry wall saw.
2,Not Very Useful,This device impeded my vision so I could not see lines in the wood. I was unable to use it for a cutting project. I also could not tell what its advantage would be.
3,Zip Zip,product is what you can expected to be only works great in Sheetrock for outlet holes. i tried using it in wood with the multiple cutting drill bit and i was a little disappointed. so for that purpose in wood not the best but Sheetrock no problem..
3,"great idea, Cheap construction","Decent Tool for light jobs, This would be a friend to a DIY'r but its plastic construction makes it rather flimsy and it shifts in areas that make it inprecise at best."
4,Had good use of it.,I do not remember how much I paid but remember I used it enough. Still have it but not using as I am not home owner any more.
5,SUPER GREAT CUTTER!,"THIS IS A SUPER GREAT CUTTER! AND A VERY LOW PRICE! VERY SHARP AND EASY TO USE, ONLY USED ON WOOD SO FAR, MAKES WORK FAST AND EASY!"
2,Careful what you use it for,"This attachment killed my dremel. Or rather, the dust created by using this attachment killed my dremel. RIP.Do not use this tool in hard wood or dusty projects, (avoid cutting drywall). If it doesn't cut like warm butter and it isn't low on dust, then don't continue unless you want to buy a new rotary tool.No more dremel, I am upgrading to Foredom."
4,There to guide me...,"Although this device is meant more for drywall cutting, I find it to be a useful tool when I'm cutting out narrow, shallow depressions in styrofoam for miniature landscape crafting. When I want to cut down to- and maintain- a specific depth, the guide lends me a really big assist.Sadly, it's one of those accessories that require the use of collets, rather than a chuck, on the rotary tool. Not a really good thing when I'm constantly changing bits, and want to do it quickly. Oh well...`Late!"
4,great practicality,"I recently began using this attachment with my Dremel to create prescise lines at uniform depths. Using this attachment, I was able to achieve the results I was looking for. The variable depth is very helpful, but a little inaccurate. Still, I would recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a simple, but very helpful attachment for their Dremel."
4,Like This One,This worship CD has got some uplifting tunes. It's a pity party buster. I recommend it for worship leaders too.
5,wonderous,"this is my alltime most favorite praise and worship cd. 'Lord You are the Holy One' and 'we give thanks' are song I have listened to 4 - 5 times in a row but what puts this cd so high above others is the last minute of Holy, Holy, Holy. the first time i heard it i was sure that i got a glimpse into heaven. the sound of their praise takes my breath from me *still*. 'there is none besides thee, oh Lord'. Indeed."
3,Hoya HMC UV(0) buyer beware =),"Recently purchased this through Amazon from eDirectPhoto Inc. Just as a heads up you'll be getting the Hoya HMC ""UV(C)"" filter and not a ""UV(0)"" filter. Supposedly they are the same filter and the ""C"" version has replaced the original ""0"" version. Google it and you'll find more info if you're wondering."
5,"Great Quality, Great Price","It is tough to b eat Hoya filters, and this one is no exception. 'Nuff said! Get one and protect your lens investments today!"
3,A bit over my head,"I knew before reading this book that I liked Spinoza's philosophies on God and life, and I was looking forward to a more in depth study on his thoughts. This book, however, was not what I had in mind. The text was difficult to follow. It could be because it was published originally in 1883 and translated from Latin. For beginners, like myself, I wouldn't recommend it. For me, this book was too mathmatically formulated. Also, there were so many references throughout the book to other paragraphs that it was distracting. All in all, good ideas but not a fun read."
5,Worth Buying,"The first two songs after Spit On a Stranger are excellent, while the last two are good. Worth buying."
2,"A strong, scholarly effort. . .",". . .but I am far from convinced.I consider myself to be a fairly bright guy. I'll even admit that, like Yogi, I'm a little smarter than your average bear. With this text, however, either I'm totally lost, or the author is trying to stretch things.This is an English translation of the writing of a French priest who is basing his theology of the Sacraments on a French translation of a German (non-Christian) philosopher. Can you see already difficulties here?The result is an utterly incomprehensible study of the relationship of Sacramental theology to Heiddegarian thought. Skip this one, and turn instead to Edward J. Kilmartin's book on Eucharistic theology in the Western Church."
5,Great stuff.,"All I can say is ""wow"" great food. I almost want to give this a negative review because I don't want the word to get out and have Tasty Bite jack up the price. After adding a couple shakes of hot sauce on this I'm reminded of my days in New Orleans. Tasted very fresh. Next time I'm adding some shrimp and sausage and I bet it will taste pretty close to a good, spicy, Jambalaya."
2,Bland and without flavor,"This rice and beans has little to no flavor.....not at all like other reviewers had stated. Certainly does not taste like New Orleans red beans and rice. Fine if you like tasteless, bland food."
3,Es demasiado para mi...,"escandalosa fragancia con fuertes cantidades de vainilla, pero una vainilla muy irritante, eso si, su sillage y longevidad son tremendas...si te gustan fragancias extremas, puede ser que te guste, aparte, por el precio vale la pena el riesgo"
5,Exactly what I expected...,"..after reading many positive reviews first. I've had my 3981 for 2+ years and it's been handy for things I can and can't do with my other tools. Quality is very good, feels solid and like it will last. I like the electronic variable speed control and the soft start. Don't have the shaky switch problem that another reviewer had mentioned.So far I use it to sharpen the lawn mower blade, make drywall cutouts for electrical outlets, trim the dogs nails, and probably half a dozen other little tasks.The only drawback is that is has a cord(!) so we've decided to get the lithium cordless version as well."
5,"Chopin Solo Piano, Vol 1","I like this album! It opened new worlds for me, of great Chopin interpreters of long, long ago. I bought both volumes of the album by mistake, hoping to get a full album of Alexandre Brailovski's keyboard work. But I'm very pleased with the music. It should be noted I am not a musician of any kind and have a somewhat limited background in classical music. But a friend who is both a professional musician and quite knowledgeable in these matters says the recordings of these artists of bygone days are, well, priceless!!"
4,A Worthy Successor,"Michael Lowenthal's second novel ""Avoidance"" raises the bar of his craft. As much as I enjoyed ""The Same Embrace"", his first novel, this novel shows a much higher complexity in its construction and plot. Lowenthal weaves a number of different subplots into the text, each one that could stand on its own merits and yet fit together into the main plot as a fine leather glove on your hand. His use of discriptive allusions brings the camp as well as the Amish scenes into a bright focus. I found that the plot had many surprises and took turns that were quite unexpected. Not to give away the story, my advice is to read the book and find out for yourself. This book may have been a long time coming, but that time seems to have paid great dividends."
2,"Amish Life and a Boy's Summer Camp had potential but ...,",Life in an Amish household and life in a boy's Summer Camp: Great idea to interweave the two stories but the book failed to maintain credibility whilst raising some very interesting parallels. Jeremy's frustrating pent up sexuality is an instrumental part of the narrative and at times it just was too constrained to be believable. Max the streetwise 14 yo Manhattan boy's vulnerability was excessively cast as every imagineable catastrophe for a young boy to have to endure was incorporated into his character. It seemed like looking at a portrait painted only in primary colours. I have not read the other two reviews on here but I am not totally surprised that one has given 5 stars and the other 2. The storyline held alot of promise but it just was not delivered in a convincing manner yet notwithstanding I enjoyed most of the book.
2,dissapointment,"this story is quite disturbing because the protagonist does not really come to understanding of his feelings to the 14 yo. He does not realize that a 14 yo cannot make adult choices. Unfortunately the author was not able to deliver the emotions of the characters. The whole Amish story was poorly incorporated into main story line. The writing is nothing exceptional.Sadly I spent 2 days reading this story trying to find something more meaningful. Bottom line: Do not read this book if you are looking for something reacher rather than just disturbing feelings of 28 yo to 14 yo. I would recommend Andre Aciman (5 stars) ""call me by your name""."
2,does he REALLY know how teenagers talk?,"okay...so i pick up this book on amazon.it got great reviews from the customers. it got a decent review from publishers weekly. but gay fiction is often predictable and trite.there.i said it. while the characters and plot are interesting to me,particularly,the amish subplot, the language seemed stilted,especially when max would talk in 'teen speak'. i actually flinched in the bathtub reading it.then i read it out loud and started laughing.for all the wrong reasons. its been a few months and i dont feel like finding the book to transcribe the offending passages but i will say that it was a disappointment.i felt like michael lowenthal had the recipe for a very good novel and it turned into a lifetime movie starring tori spelling and chad allen."
3,"Good, but...","The pictures are nice, but the music is sounds like something you'd hear on those training videos they make you watch on a new job orientation. The price was low enough for me to want to give it a shot. Then again, I guess you get what you pay for."
1,Not worth the money,In my opinion the HDscape Sampler should be distributed at no cost to encourage people to purchase the regular ones.
3,HDscape Sampler HD DVD,"fantasic clear images but very short duration of each title, by the time you start enjoying it, the title is over. If you dont mind playing the repeat button - this is very good, but for me it was just too short of a duration for each title."
2,At least now I don't have to buy the full versions...,"This sampler is only good in that you will instantly realize there's no point in buying the full versions of the HDscapes.I've become a bit obsessed with trying to find the right ""screensaver"" for my HD TV. Fireplaces and Aquariums are my favorite, so naturally I jumped at this sampler to see if maybe HDScape would be able to offer what I need. Unfortunately, they did not. These images aren't even true HD and are poorly filmed. I wouldn't have any of the samples playing during any occasion, as it'd make my expensive tv look cheap. Stay away!"
4,Beautiful samples from different blu ray discs,"A lot of nice fishes, spectacular places....I think that it is a very good experience of high definition for 3 dollars.This blu ray disc was very cheap and you receive even more than what you have paid for."
1,I paid for this??,WASTE!WASTE!WASTE!This should be free with the DVE (BD) disc I got.The only reason I gave it 1 star is because I like the Blue box!Steve H.
2,Should be free,Anyone that got the chance to see or hear this first would not spend even this small amount.
4,HDscape Sampler (HD DVD + DVD Combo),HDscape Sampler (HD DVD + DVD Combo)This is a good sampler to start with as more and more movies go to high-def. The price was right too. I don't even have a HD-DVD player yet but of course it comes with a standard DVD side to the single disc for best of both worlds. I'm really looking forward to that new Plasma and HD player coming soon to me this year. Blu-ray and HD-DVD is the way of the future!
1,good quality but beware the fast edit,"like some of the other titles in this series, the quality is excellent. It really takes advantage of the high definition format. However, this is like other titles in the series, the editing is very fast. Too fast. Not serene enough and just when you get to admire the moment of the scene, it changes."
1,Terrible camera for HD Blu-ray quality,"I guess for the price it's CHEAP and I guess they used a CHEAP camera to do HD. Some shots looks as if it was done with a VHS camera, out of focus for most of the scene. It is not 1080p Blu-ray quality. Maybe the production was done with a VHS or mini DV and produced in a studio to bump up the final sequence. To use it as a sampler in a store to demo HD Blu-ray 1080p no customers would want to buy the TV or Blu-ray player. They would leave with an inaccurate concept of HD, or to understand the quality of 1080p realism."
1,Don't do it......... Please Don't do it.....,This a waste of time and money. Buy it and you can come here and write the same thing I did.
3,Don't waste your money,"They should be sending this out for free, I watched through the videos once and its been sitting every since. Great looking scenery and landscapes. Don't waste your money on this teaser HD-DVD, If you're looking for HD landscapes splurge for the full version."
5,It has other uses than playing HD samples.,Ever wonder what it takes to scratch a Blu-Ray Disc? That's what this disc is best used as. The HD Sampler Scratch Test Blu-Ray Disc.For the low low price of $7 you can find out what it takes to scratch a Blu-Ray Disc to the point of it being unplayable.Good Luck
1,HD DVD doesn't give menu options on XBox 360 HD DVD add on.,"It seems to be a very interesting disc, DVD side plays without problems, but of course, it is not HD quality, the reason why I bought it. On the other side, HD DVD version starts to play, gets to the menu and...stops there. It doesn't give options to navegate, doesn't go further when played on XBox 360 HDDVD addon. This is very sad, but it could be fixed with a firmware upgrade I believe. I wrote an e-mail to HDScape, but they did not answer me back.Bad customer support and bad product. It is a shame :("
1,houston we have a problem.,You are stuck in menu everytime. You have to turn of and on several times with Tosh HD-E1 . Sometimes if you are lucky you can play.And images are slightly softer then HDDVD movies. can not pass blacker than black and oversaturated colors.You can not adjust your system with this even you can play.
1,360 owners stay away (UPDATE: It works on the 360 now),"this does not play in the 360 HD-DVD player. I contacted support and they said it would work after the 5/7/07 update. Well, the update is out and this still does not work. This is the only disk that I have that does not work on the 360. I can not imagine what they have done to mess up a menu to the point of breaking the disk. I ordered Digital Video Essentials from this same company -- luckly I have not opened it so I can return it.UPDATE: An update to the 360 DVD Player came out toady and now the disk works."
1,Useless in Xbox 360 HD-DVD drive add-on...,"The original reviewer has it right. This disc does not work correctly in the 360 add-on drive. That could change I suppose with an update of some sort. For now though, avoid this disc if your only HD-DVD player is attached to an Xbox 360."
4,"Warmer, jazzier, and more varied than most smooth jazz.","As a smooth jazz album, ""Private Reserve"" has obvious strengths. Its overall sound is warmer, jazzier, and more varied than that of many established artists in the field. For starters, live drumming distinguishes the CD from those by many smooth jazz performers who often employ drum machines and pre-recorded ""rhythm loops."" Also, the occasional flute solos are unexpected and welcome pleasures, further elevating this recording from the norm.Jazz on the Vine deserves praise for their accomplished musicianship and a level of songwriting that smartly avoids most of the cliches of the genre."
5,The basic textbook to have,"I've owned this book for several years, and like to re-read it every so often, to remind me of basic facts I need to remember. This is just soooo basic and simple, it's like of course I should have realized that. And it is the perfect travel book, small, easy to pick up and read a bit. Easy to read and simple facts. Wonderful job, adding a thought process to what you want to present to the world."
4,Not as good as I first thought.,"Like Polarity, this album had me gripped at first. It's got great music, good vocals, and some catchy lyrics at points. However, now that I've been exposed to Haujobb's earlier (and better) albums, especially their mid-career works (Solutions, Matrix, and '99) this albums seems to be a bit less of a masterpiece. Now, don't get me wrong, it's still a great album,but now I can recognize its flaws. A good portion of the tracks seem to blend together into a single kind of sound that's not bad, but not exceptional. In fact, that basically describes the entire album -- not bad, but not their best work. Still, the album is very good, but it's not as good as it should have been."
4,ESSENTIAL ALBUM,"fIRST OFF THE SONG ""PENETRATION"" IS WORTH BUYING THE WHOLE ALBUM FOR. aS FOR THE REST OF THE ALBUM...IT'S GOOD. eXPERIMENTAL, FUTURISTIC INDUSTRIAL AND POP. gREAT RECORD!"
5,Different.,"How unusual!!! I was so happy when I finally got around to buying this CD. In the past, when it comes to Electronic Industrial music, I have been dissapointed. I am pleased to say that Haujobb are indeed an original band with verry good lyrics and truly great talent. The music is complex, verry technichal, and gives your Ipod/Zune something fresh to help break up the monatany of the other electro/EBM bands that all sound the same. I am amazed that more fans of the Industrial genre don't know about this album. It's soooooooo cool. I love the song ""Penetration""."
2,LG oem 1000MAh Li-Ion battery,"The service was great, the product even arrived before promised. But the battery was not the 1000mAh Li-Ion, it is a 1100mAh. Which I thought would be even better, but the battery does not keep a charge for as long as the 1000mAh original. I do not know if it is a used battery or not, I ordered a new battery. And the problem with an exchange is that I am in Africa for an extended time, I had the battery mailed to my wife and then she forwarded it to me. It took a lot to time and extra postage to get the battery and I am somewhat disappointed in the cycle time of the battery."
2,How does it work?,"The Adorama Silica Gel came without any instructions on how to use and reuse it. I emailed customer service at Adorama to ask how to use it and how to recharge it once it has absorbed enough moisture but they did not respond. I can't tell when it needs recharging and when it is ready. What color should it be and what color should indicate recharging. How to I recharge it? Nothing tells me how to recharge it. So far, money wasted. Unresponsive to my emails."
1,I'm unhappy,I can't say if the product works or not because I haven't been able to use it. It didn't come with any instructions and I've called the company twice. I spoke to a very nice woman who promised to call the manufacturer and get all the info to me along with written instructions on how to use the product. They haven't called back and I plan to call again this morning. (Adorama Silica Gel with refills)
4,Instructions were on case in older model,"I bought one of these items in December '04 from Adorama. It had directions written in raised letters on the canister itself. I just ordered here and received a second one in March '07 and the ""new"" model has no instructions. Other than that, it looks identical to the old one, so I assume the contents are the same.Here are the exact words written on the old one:""HYDROSORBENT 40 GRAM SILICA GEL""""WHEN PINK, REACTIVATE 3 HOURS AT 300F""The pink referred to is the little circle in the center of the canister.I keep this product with my camera (in closed stuff sack) and it seems to work as advertised - though I guess you just have to have faith that it does - no easy way to prove it (except maybe in extremely humid climes)."
4,small sealed boxes,"This item is great for keeping a small sealed box dry. If you have something you are storing items in like a camera box that does not get used frequently, this is a great inexpensive solution to keeping it dry. I use it in a 1.5 cubic foot sealed box and after opening it about 10 times, I would need to re-charge it. I do not open this box much (maybe once in 6 months) so it is good for keeping a small sealed container dry. For a safe that you go in and out of more frequently, get the large can size or maybe the eva-dry system.This is mainly for things like that musical instrument you no longer play and just keep stored away."
4,Decent item for decent price.,"Needed some silica gel to keep my camera gear clean and prevent fungus on the lens. Bought 3 of these to put inside my Kata DR 467 bag. They came in these tin cans and the first reaction I had was ""What? That's it?, [...]?"" Well I guess the pricing was worth it because after all, they are re-usable. They turn pink when they are hydrated, to dehydrate them again you'll need to sutff them in a oven for 3 hours at 300 degrees. They are blue when they are de-hydrated and are ready to use. The only downside I had to these things are the tin feels so flimsy and can easily dent or bend. I stuff them in my camera gear in between the padding so my camera equipment doesn't put any dents on these silica gel canisters. It works like it should and can last for a very long time if they are used properly and you are careful with not crushing the canisters."
2,"Works, but long to recharge, and prone to spills","I bought three of these to use in my instrument cases when the instruments were out of them. They did the job to keep the case dry. But to recharge these takes 3 hours in the oven, which seems like a lot. Also, I had the aluminum boxes open and spill the silica beads. It's no fun getting all that silica dust out of a padded instrument case, let me tell you. Get the EvaDry plug-in ones, and be happy."
3,"Works well, but...","Works well, but, I've discovered that the amount of heat and baking time required in order to re-use it just isn't worth the cost of the energy. I've found that rice in cheesecloth works just as well and is less expensive."
3,FootSmart Men's Diabetic Active Crew Socks,"For the price the socks are a good value. It is the strange method of delivery that was my major complaint. Since diabetic socks are more loosely knitted to help circulation, it was illogical to me to find metal clips binding the socks at the toe and top in the packaging. If the socks are pulled apart as is the natural inclination, the metal clips rips the toe and unravels the threading at the top of the sock opening even before you put them on. Otherwise, taking that precaution, they are a good price."
4,Shore Thing,Shore Thing is about two twin girls that go on a field trip and have the most fantasic time of there lifes. This book is really great. I think that it is the best one out of the whole series. It has a great cover and from beginning to end it is marvelous. You should read this book and find out by your self. So buy the book or read some more online reviews to know more about it. I hope you enjoy it.
3,not much moisturizing,"Product much lighter and thicker than I would have liked; I do not see any ""rose"" in it. It is more of a beige, and no discernible moisturizers."
4,A nice introduction to modern methods,"I think the previous review is a bit harsh, and that the book's intents are not what this reviewer expected. I don't think it was the author's intent to write a comprehensive treatise on the subject. The book simply aims at introducing undergraduate students to the use of symmetry in simplifying the analysis of classical mechanic problems, nothing more. If you want a comprehensive treatise, you probably want to read V.I. Arnols's ""Mathematical methods in classical mechanics"". If what you want is a simple introduction where all the steps are worked out in details, then this book is a good starting point, and I think this is what the author intended. At any rate, the cost ($$$) is quite reasonable."
4,Three years in Tristan da Cunha,"Interesting to get a feel for the way the world looked to everyday people more than 100 years ago. Viewed as a story, though, the book is quite inconclusive. The reproduced edition did not include the figures and photographs from the original, which was a loss."
1,Not -THAT- Aqua,"I was expecting, you know, 'Around the World,' 'Barbie Girl,' 'Lollipop'.... that Aqua. What I got was some heavily accented dude singing. I've skimmed it just to get a general overview after realizing my mistake, so I haven't really listened to it well enough to see if any of it is good enough to keep. I guess I should have know since the Aqua logo is different, but it was in Amazon's 'Aqua Store' with the real Aqua's stuff so I just figured 'cool, I didn't know Aqua had released another album'..."
5,high quality sardines,"This is a great product for taste,packaging and price; difficult to find in stores and shipping was very fast. It is also a very healthy food source in olive oil."
1,Bait and switch,"These USED to be an excellent value but in Sept/Oct 2011, Seasons changed their can design (which itself is a good thing because the old cans were difficult to open), BUT they put in less sardines and the sardines are now of an inferior quality. The old can had a printed net weight of 3.75 oz, and there were in fact about 3.8 oz of sardines in the can...6-7 tender, moist yummy sardines. Now, in the new cans (which open from the corner), the actual weight of the sardines is about 3 oz...almost a 1/4 loss of product (the printed weight is STILL 3.75 oz)...AND THE PRICE IS STILL THE SAME. What makes it worse is that the sardines are big (2-3 sardines vs the older 5-6 sardines, dry, tough and have an off smell. If you get a can which opens from the top, you're good to go, but if you have the newer can which opens from the corner, you're getting an inferior sardine and paying more for less. Another example of an American company sacrificing quality for higher profits."
4,"Somewhat Larger and Firmer, but Excellent Taste.","I've been on a campaign to add more fish to my diet and a lot of it has been by increasing my uptake of canned fish such as tuna, salmon and sardines. As such, I found a wrapped five-pack of Season Sardines at my local Costco store and picked it up. They're a good sardine and I've been eating them with seasoned crackers at lunchtime. Their somewhat larger than normal for me and they have a texture that is somewhat firm. The taste is excellent and they go down easily. My cat loves to lick the leftover crumbs on the plate. I don't care for Season Sardines as much as for the last can of Crown Prince bristling sardines, but the difference is slight. I would definitely buy this brand again.Gary Peterson"
5,Tasty Sardine Goodness,"Easy to review, the best sardines I have ever had. Superior to regular sardines in several respects to my taste anyway. The lack of skin and bones seems to remove all objectionable things in these tasty tiny fish, I forced my sardine hating nephew to share a can of these with me and now I can't keep him out of my Sardine Stash, he still balks at the full featured sardines and I can't blame him as I too now eat only these sardines I gave away a whole case of regular Season Sardines, same brand but no comparison these are just plane tasty and no fishiness at all. I sill usually for a snack eat these with a little honey mustard, wow, a satisfying way to stay on my diet.Even if you only kind of like sardines or even if you don't like them try these as they taste nothing like run of the mill sardines, they kind of taste closer to canned tuna than normal sardines that I have a hard time eating at times too."
5,Well Worth your time.....,Some of the most amazing stories I have ever heard... This audio book is a journey you will not forget.. Tom Brown Shares these stories with true emotions that bring you along.....This book carries a deep wisdom that is shown so cleanly..It would make a great gift to anyone you care about...
5,A whole new book,"I have read Grandfather. I have even been lucky enough to read an unedeted transcript of Grandfather. This audiobook blows them away! It is like a completly new book. The lessons and details that you get by hearing Tom tell the story brings Grandfather to a whole new level. Even though you may have read the stories, there are all these little details slipped in. Reflections after each chapter add perspective and insight. Some how listining to the story being told is a different experience both mentally and spiritually. You need to get this book, stop reading reviews!"
1,Lies!!,This book should be listed under fiction along with the rest of Mr. Brown's false accounts. One can only feel sorry for those who have fallen prey to the Tracker Cult that this man has carefully devised over the course of his career. Almost all of his former instructors have renounced their belief in his legitimacy. Don't waste your money on anything he has attached his name to.
2,A Glossy Work,"Tom Brown has written some excellent works--most notably ""The Tracker"". Unfortunately, this book indulges in sentimental descriptions of a powerful philosophy. He does little in the way of delving into the main character's real personae. We are provided a schemata at best in which ""Grandfather"" seems to operate from; the same set of emotions as that of Mythological gods. He is triumphant, angry, elated, and sad and these are the types of general words that Tom Brown uses to portray the experiences of life worthy of better reflection. We never get to really know who the real ""Grandfather"" is. This book, somewhat egotistical on Tom Brown's part, seems like a poor attempt at fiction. It is interesting to be sure, but not moving or realisitic."
5,"""Grandfather"" is....Grand!","If you have read any of Tom Brown's books, you know about ""Grandfather"", but no matter how much you think you know...you need to read this book! It is best read after you've read some of the other selections, it ties things together wonderfully and says things none of the other books say. It is a 'must have' for all who enjoy Brown's books."
4,Very good cookbook. Great cook,I find this very good French cookbook by American restaurant. The food is exactly right and very traditional
5,"The ""Whole Bistro Book""","Excellent Foodie book, particularly if you like bistro type of food. Bourdain covers the character and operation of the bistro and the classic menu it generates. He details the restaurant prep of these dishes and provides a parallel procedure for prep in the home. He wraps these around the operation of his own hugely successful bistro and its interesting clientele.Very entertaining food book, with some interesting recipes thrown in. A great read if you like food but aren't interested in cooking it. Even better read if you do like to cook."
3,Don't attempt the Coq au Vin,"Although the book is written well, and has old school French recipes (like Blanquette de Veau) I followed Tony's Coq au Vin recipe (took two days!!) to the letter, and the end result was diasstrous! Buyer beware! Love Tony's wit as always!"
4,"Great cookbook, but not for everyone for an avoidable reason","I have been a long-time Bourdain fan. I have probably given 15 copies of Kitchen Confidential as gifts and I record every episode of A Cook's Tour on TiVo. You have probably read the other reviews praising the contents. I agree in general. However, after briefly skimming a few pages I assumed this book would be great so I ordered copies as holiday gifts for a number of clients. I read the entire book over Christmas and realized to my horror that Bourdadin simply and unnecessarily went overboard with his language. I am not squeamish about bad language but this was so bad that I will be replacing the gift with an apology note to my clients. If you can get beyond that distraction, this is a terrific cookbook. For future revisions, there are better ways of making a point - even as a ""bad boy"" - than regressing to such adolescent tactics."
5,"Great for amateur cooks, AND for the proffessional!!","This is a great book by Bourdain. His personality and sense of humour shine through!! Great recipes that most people can repeat, with easy to find ingredients....and really emphasizes organization in the kitchen...your ""meez""."
5,Jimmy Breslin meets James Beard ...,"Bourdain brings the same no-nonsense, hard talking patter that made Kitchen Confidential so enjoyable to an actual cookbook. He writes like he talks and in a universe where cookbooks are too often just artsy coffee table decorations that is refreshing. Throughout the book you get the sense that Bourdain is actually talking to you (OK, sometimes he's yelling at you) which makes the whole thing feel more like a conversation on cooking rather than a school text book. I'd been cooking for years but had never attempted to make my own demi-glace. After reading his passage on veal stock I gave it a try and it worked great. If you own a lot of cookbooks (like I do) and think you just don't need another go buy it anyway. You won't regret it."
4,Handbook of Tasty Pleasure,"This is a bible and a foundation for anyone interested in seeing good results from their efforts in undertaking french cooking. These recipes are durable and refined for someone who wants to illicit ""oh wow"" responses from their guests. I can't overstate the social value of enlisting your friends and local grocers and butcher for this journey. This is a book for someone with some time and love to dedicate."
3,Not your first Cookbook,"I enjoyed reading this book but if you are not aiming to be a professional chef, you might as well settle with Julia Child's Mastering the Art of French Cooking."
5,Love this book!!!,Bourdain brings the same flavor and zest to his writing here as he does to his show on the Travel channel---I love his mix of sardonic wit blended with his passion for travel and food.
3,"Great content, poor package",The recipes are great and I really like Anthony Bourdain's approach.My issue is with the actual book/binding. I used to think that hardcovers were inherently more durable. Big mistake - this one began losing pages within 1 year.
5,Tremendously talented Tony,"This book is Anthony Bourdain at his finest. Descriptive author, amazing chef, and a storyteller extraordinar - a chance to have a peek into some of his recipes will make this book a wonderful addition to my collection of not only his books, but my cookbook collection. Worth every penny. To have not had the chance to dine in Les Hallas is a loss - to live vicariously through the recipes, and the talent who put them together makes my time well spent as I try to cook every one as written."
5,The real world through a chef's eyes,"The first 35 pages or so should be reprinted at the front of every cook book published. Truer words have never been written about preping food, cooking food, and eating food. All filtered through the mind of a serious, production oriented chef. I have found it almost impossible to explain to my friends what my life as a chef is/was like, and why I am the way I am when it comes to food, but this book, along with Kitchen Confidential, comes as close as anything I've ever read to my autobiography. This is great reading and Anthony should be commended for his efforts. Cooks are pretty picky about who they will work with, but I wouldn't mind looking over just before the rush hits and seeing Mr. Bourdain standing there waiting for a ticket. Better him than some of the prissy Food Network ""talent""."
5,Awesome,Great recipes and fun and entertaining read? Recommend for any chef pro or beginner. Great yet simple recipes. Trust me you'll love it.
5,Cooking insights,"Classic cooking done in classic Anthony Bourdain style. If you like his TV show, you'll love this book."
4,The Direct Marketing Bible,So many marketers today have 'forgotten' the fundamental testing techniques which build the Mail-Order industry. This book helps you grasp those key concepts. It is more of a text book overview than a how-to guide - but I would start here before diving into building your own direct marketing empire. You might also enjoy Spinning Straw Into Gold - more geared to people in the industry alreadySpinning Straw Into Gold: An Executive Guide to the Magic of Turning Data Into Money
1,annoying,although informative .. this is one of the most boring and sometimes obvious textbooks i have ever read
5,"If it were a tape, it'd be worn out already","I drove across country shortly after getting this cd, and I barely took it out of the cd player the whole way--not sure how many hundreds of times that means I've listened to this! I love the ""new"" Dixie Chicks, too (sisters Martie and Emily Erwin are the only common thread), but I was curious about their previous sound, and I wasn't disappointed! This is a great record, with a lot of great harmony and, of course, talented ladies playing the heck out of just about every stringed instrument there is.That said, buy their new records too! Natalie Maines, the lead singer, is witty and expressive, and her beautiful voice goes great with Martie and Emily's fiddle/banjo/mandolin/etc. Laura Lynch and Robin Lynn Macy brought some very different things to the mix, but their departures were largely, if not entirely, their own choices, and I hate to see Natalie punished for that."
5,Fantastic - I was blown away!,"Saw this group at a bluegrass festival in '92 or so and was blown away. Bought this tape and wore it out! Hot bluegrass licks, tight harmony - somewhat different from the band's current style. I wasn't at all surprised to see the group hit the big time, but I'd like to see a little of the style of this recording brought to their current work. Way to go, Chicks!"
3,Cheb Khaled,Not bad for his old material. Mami and Khaled are the best Rai singers around. His newer stuff is much better though this is not a bad cd if you like the slow music.
1,Not the right picture,The battery shown is not the one you get. The battery in the picture is no longer manufactured and has been discontinued for quite a while.
2,Not compatible with all Dremel Rotary Tools as advertised,"The Mini-mite Battery Pack pictured on Amazon with a black and blue outer case will not fit all Dremel rotary tools as stated. I purchased it to replace my 7.2 volt Battery Pack No. 757 that came with my Dremel MultiPro Cordless Model 770, but it will not fit on the Model 770 Tool. Apparently Dremel does not offer the Model 757 Battery Pack any longer as I have been unable to locate it anywhere. Fortunately the Amazon Vendor, Mid-Atlantic Merchant, graciously accepted the item in return for a full refund including cost of shipping and handling. I give this vendor high marks in spite of a lacking product."
2,Meh. Fake looking pictures and unpronouncable species names,"and a little quiz on each page :'Which dinosaur has 2 big horns'....Seriously, if you can pronounce more than 80% of the names, much less your kid,you are probably a reptologist."
3,No text,"Nice pictures of dinosaurs, with their names, on sturdy cardboard stock pages. No text or story, just ids and pictures. i think my grandsons, four and almost three, would have liked it better if there had been some accompanying story or description of the dinosaurs."
5,"Another great ""My Big..."" book!","The ""My Big Dinosaur Book"" is a great addition to the Big Ideas for Little People series of books (we also have the Trains and Trucks books). Both of my sons love these books -- my 5 year old STUDIES every name, picture, and category and has been reading the Dinosaur book every day since he received it. My 3 year old loves to look at the pictures over and over.The photos have realistic and colorful models of each dinosaur, most of the full body (a few have just the face). I do agree that pronunciations would be really really nice to have. The heavier board-book style makes it very durable, especially for little ones who are prone to tearing out pages.This is a must-have addition to the library of any young dinosaur fan!"
3,"""Priddy"" Disappointing","Unlike many of the other reviewers who thought this book was too difficult or complicated, I actually had the opposite problem. I bought the book hoping to see a wide variety of dinosaurs and names, so that we could improve our recognition and vocab a little. Instead, several of the pictures are repeated on different pages, or else only part of the dinosaur is shown, so we can't even tell if it stands on two legs or four. My 2 year old still likes the book, but I was hoping for a little more ""meat"" and a little less fluff. I was disappointed, as many Priddy Books are much more educational. Instead this is a nice supplement to what we already have but I wouldn't consider it a good stand-alone dinosaur book."
1,Disappointed Dino lover,"This book does not have many of the popular Dinos, book good quality, thick, pictures nice but they reuse them instead of having new ones, if you are having text, give us more. Would return if I did not already give to my 3 year old. SHould have read reviews first! My bad."
5,My big...books,"This is a great book, great series really. My son found this (oops) before I wrapped it for his birthday, and he was so excited! Thanks to Dino Dan, he knows all of his dinos! Great book for him to read to himself, or make up stories about the dinos while reading with me!"
3,neat book but dirty,the book is neat with all the different dino names but it was bent and dirty when i got it. I cleaned it up set the book under a 35lb weight of my husbands. In the end it was fine. But I didn't expect that.
3,"Good, not great","I bought this book for my young nephew who's into dinosaurs. It has nice pictures, but that's the jist of it. I'm a tad disappointed. Maybe dinosaurs just aren't my thing."
5,great children's book,Great pictures- very colorfulI love all of the books available from Priddy- realistic and colorful picturessturdy board books for toddlers
5,Great!,The book is exactly as pictured. My son LOVES dinosaurs so I know he will enjoy this book when he gets it for christmas :)
1,Have yet to receive the order.,I purchased this on January 18 for my grandson's 3rd birthday on February 3. I have yet to see it shipped and it is now Feb 16! When will he receive this? When he enters college maybe?
2,My big dinosaur book,The book arrived dirty This is a Christmas Gift. There were old tape marks on the front cover and the inside look used. I am very disappointed Amazon would send out a book advertised as Brand New in this condition!!!!!!
4,Dino!,My son loves dinosaurs and this book had them all. The pictures look like they are toy dinosaurs instead of what they should look like if they were alive today.
5,My Big Dinosaur Book,This is a great book for preschoolers. Used it in the classroom and every children enjoyed it. Especially the boys who have a fascination for Dinosaurs. Illustrations are wonderful. Would highly recommend it.
3,it's ok,"my sons like the pictures, but none of us can pronounce any of the names. I feel like an idiot trying to pronounce some of these dinosaurs. A phonetic pronunciation would be helpful."
3,"Beautifully written, but fails to maintain interest","This is certainly a beautifully written book, but the premise that it is about the pleasure of books and why we read them is somewhat misleading. It is really a story of people, and their incredibly complex lives, and in that it loses its way a little. The characters are only hinted at, whereas I like to know more about them, and their adventures drift into the fantastic, whilst attempting to stay grounded in the real world.Somehow it doesn't get there. Sure it is lovely to read, with beautiful prose, but it was a struggle to finish. I like books that grab my attention, and hold it to the end."
5,Just what I ordered,Everything was just as I wanted. They even sent it special so I could get it in time for the shower.
3,Good and Bad,"Pros: Great coverage. Pleasant, neutral scent. No chemicals / no harsh ingredients.Cons: Rather thick and very difficult to spread. Has a cakey look if not blended really well.I think this product is ok, but for the price (I paid $29 at Wholefoods) it should be much better."
5,the best for me,"I tried many foundations over the years and as I became more conscious about what I eat and what I apply to my skin it became challenging to find the right makeup that will be pretty healthy ingredients wise as well as matching my skin type and tone. I'm glad I tried Gabriel foundation at the local health food store! I absolutely love it!! And one small bottle lasts for a long time. The trick i use to make it look natural is apply moisturizer with SPF, then use wet hands and apply a bit of this wonderful foundation followed by loose powder. My skin have never looked better!!"
1,Don't bother.............,"I have not purchased a book of this low caliber in quite a long time. The author is dull, self aggrandizing, and let's face it, just plain cruel. Could she hold herself in a more venerated state? Could she make more snide cynical remarks about the folks she meets...their problems, lifestyle, language? I doubt it. I could go on forever here, but why bother. I am too embarrassed to donate this book to a charity resale shop."
2,Disappointing....,"I had high hopes for this book and, while some of the stories were interesting, the book left me feeling unsatisfied. Most of the time it seem that the author ran across poor-tasting pies and, at other times, she failed to get recipes for the good ones, both of which were extremely frustrating. Even if she was unable to obtain the exact recipes for the peach pie and the white bean pie she describes, I felt that she should have put some effort towards obtaining good ones. Also, at one point, someone mentioned where she could get the ""best"" kind of a certain pie, but she refused to go out of her way to drive there (I believe this was an apple pie in Texas)! I readily tired of her constant natter about how good, homemade pie is a disappearing art in America -- a trite comment that really only needed to be mentioned once."
3,TAKE OFF THE PRICE TAGS!,"The shaker arrived quickly and in one piece. It's a very nice shaker, reminiscent of the shakers of the Fifties. I bought it, along with the martini glasses, as a gift for my sister because it reminded me of our mother's glass and chrome shaker. So far, so good.When I went to wrap it, I, of course, checked it for price tags. There was a tag on it that said $17.99. The Amazon site listed it as a $42.00 MSRP on sale for 50% off, $21.00. Not exactly the bargain it purported to be.Still, all in all, I was pleased with the shaker and my sister loved it. Amazon might want to consider removing ""outdated"" price tags before shipping in the future."
5,AVB Rocks!,"I first got this tape in 5th grade, which was pretty close to when it came out. It was certainly a new style of Music to me, but I have worn that tape ragged. Being an audio cassette tape I had to rewind it to re listen to a song. My favorites were ""U R Not Alone"", ""Ignorance Ain't Bliss"", and ""Money"". I would listen to this tape a dozen times a day. I have since gotten another tape that I lucked out and found on a clarence rack and three CD. AVB does not use instruments, but they are awesome with making music with their mouths and fingers and whatever else it is they use to make the cool music on this tape / CD. They aren't the easiest to find, but if there are copies here on amazon or anywhere else, snatched them up and give AVB a try."
5,UPLIFTING,THIS CD IS WONDERFUL. I PLAY IT WHEN IM HAPPY AND WHEN IM DOWN. EITHER WAY IT IS ALWAYS UPLIFTING! I RECOMMEND IT TO ALL AGES. YOU WILL FEEL BLESSED.
5,one of the best christian groups ever,"Out of eden truly rocks these three sisters really show there stuff! I love there lyrics! there music makes you want to get off your chair and groove! if you like TLC and some of those groups than this is a must! (it's a must anyway!:) lookin' for love talks about ""looking for love in all the wrong places..."" which teaches something good, un'like Britney Spears who can't seam to keep her hands off herself, if you buy this CD you WON'T be sorry!"
4,Great,Have bought a few cases before and these are good. It seems that the more expensive they are the least tacky they are. If you can make sense of that. Just add a little piece of tape to make sure it stays closed in the mail.They can be very rough with the mail.
5,Excellent product,"These No. 5 Self-Sealing Kraft Bubble Mailers are perfect for shipping books, materials, and other items I am shipping. Since I am downsizing my home - I needed a good product to protect my things. Shipment was perfect and the large shipping box made a great storage box."
2,so-so quality,"Compared to other #5 padded envelopes I have purchased, these are of so-so quality. For this batch, the bubbles in the back top middle part of the envelopes are almost always flat."
2,NOT self-sealing with no glue!,"Just opened the box and the strips to cover the glue on the flap were lying loose in it, and I discovered there was no glue on the envelopes. I always keep an extra box on hand, so I opened it past the 30 day return day. Back to the tape, I guess.Could find no email address or phone number to see if I could get some company response."
5,New Balance Womens 598,"I love these sneakers, they are so comfortable and stylish. Have a pair in black also."
1,Cute Shoe but..,"I've been wearing New Balance shoes for over 20 years and they never have let me down. Until now. I have always assumed that the width of the shoe would be average however, these shoes were very narrow. So narrow I had to send them back. :("
2,Machine has nice features but needs refinement.,"Speed control at intermediate speeds was slightly erratic and caused mechanism backlash noises under no-load conditions. The underside of the upper arm housing has sharp edges - watch your hands if you pick it up there. The hinge on the blade storage compartment isn't strong enough and the door closure detent doesn't always line up. The lamp isn't bright enough. The hole in the table is a little large - an insert would be nice. The blade tensioner quick release has a pinch zone - can catch flesh. The knob on the lower blade jaw can hit the bottom of the table in one of the 45 degree tilts. Finally, this saw has a fairly aggresive fore-aft blade movement when cutting; cuts fast but not so good for fine work."
2,Motor quit on two units,I bought this saw a little over a year ago. 2 weeks after I had the first on the motor just shut down. I was able to return the unit to where I bought it for a replacement. Since then it's worked great. Last week this unit just shut down. It's not the reset switch as I've tested that. So now I'm faced with getting it repaired. While I like the oversized table and the vibration was good. I'm disappointed in this problem with the unit just stopping. I wish I had bought the Dewalt unit I was looking at.
2,"Wish I had goften something else, now.","I received the saw for a retirement present, and it was a while before I had my shop organized. I had never owned a scroll saw before, so was unaware of how it should sound, or work. Noisy, vibration, and plain end blades are impossible to keep tight. Will not cut square, despite squaring the table and blade. Warranty is expired, so I will replace it, hopefully, soon.My next saw will definitely not be a Dremel, and from what I read, the DeWalt may not be such a good deal either, being built in the Orient.Word to the wise. Do not buy a scroll saw without having a hands on session."
2,Great tool ... when it works,"My first Dremel scroll saw lasted about a month - I touched the scroll saw while vacuuming my shop, a spark jumped, and it immediately stopped working. Lowes was great - they replaced it right away. However, about a year and a half after that, the saw simply quit working. Everything looked ok - nothing jammed, bearings ok, power ok, it didn't overheat and reset, etc. It looked like, in a bone dry Arizona shop, that static was the culprit the second time as well. I concluded that Dremel didn't add adequate protection against electrostatic discharge (ESD), and that ESD fried the electronic motor control. This makes Dremel far too high a risk for me to ever buy another one - even if I lived elsewhere, as winters can still be very dry. Too bad, because the tool is otherwise great."
2,Very Average,"For the hobbiest who has a lot of time on his/her hands,this machine is probably ok. As a professional woodworker, I found the blade changing to be excessively difficult, hit and miss with the top rear tensioner. Also, it's foot doesn't fit right to the wood surface; causing strain when moving the piece around for precise cuts. Mine developed a loud clanking sound after only a few hours of use, and eventually blew fuses, and finally shut down completely. It has some nice features, like the controls up front, large base, and variable speed control; but, unfortunately, not very reliable for the serious scroll saw enthusiast."
4,Dremel 1680 Scroll Saw,This is a well built saw. It has a nice large table and the work light is a big plus. It does seem to have a little bit more vibration than some other saws. It should be attached to a heave work bench or stand with a rubber pad beneath it. This helps reduce the vibration a good deal but not totally.
1,Boring,I was hoping for a yoga book with pictures that allows me easy and safe postures -- maybe modified -- of the standard beginner yoga. Instead I got pictures - a book full of them -- of people lying on the floor on their backs sleeping. Waste of a book.
2,not really yoga,if you want to learn how to relax by not doing yoga then this is the book for you! this book describes ways to relax by breathing and lying on the floor using towels and blankets to make your self more comfortable.. which seems more like a great way to fall asleep than yoga.
4,great for students and teachers!,Very useful in sequencing classes. I am a yoga instructor just learning about prenatal and restorative yoga and I am finding this very helpful and informative. Well laid out and simple.
2,No need to buy the new release,"This book is fabulous for this type of practice, but the new release is a disappointment in that there is no change to the content except for being in a larger book size with some of the headings now in blue ink. With this new edition the material should have been reorganized so that all of the information for a particular pose was together in one place in the book. Then a section with the sequences listed out. As the book is presently presented, if you are following a sequence for a stress release class and the pose was presented earlier in the book, it refers you back for each of the details on setting up, in the pose, and releasing. Very frustrating to have to keep flipping all over the place. I am only giving two stars to the edition because the content did not change, the presentation should have been restructured, and not because the material is not good."
4,"Great Book, indespensible. A must have for your library!",This is a really great book. Well put together. This is a must have for any Yoga Instructor. Thank you Judith for putting this together.Kris
4,Good Supplement to the overall method,This DVD is a good supplement to the first booh of the method series and I feel it well worth the money...
5,Fantastic!,"I'm sooooo happy to have it! - excellent quality of the sound... Thanks Amazon!Kind Regard, Ada."
2,"Inaccurate at times, hard to read, but great for making outlines","The best part about this book is that it will enable you to make a very useful outline, as long as you don't include any substantive information. Some things aren't quite accurate, the review questions can be misleading, too many details, but I made an incredible outline with this book. Buying it from Amazon didn't work out (binding issues) but I bought it again at a local bookstore simply for the Capsule Summary. Everything else is better left to Gilbert's or Emmanuels."
1,Not the Original Recordings Unfortunately,"Sadly, the cover of this CD, when you finally receive it, says it all in small print at the bottom: ""New Stereo Recordings By Original Artists."""
2,Super Hits 1969,"As the other reviewer noted three or four years ago, these are remakes. However, I would have hoped that somewhere, sometime, you could find a version of Oliver's ""Good Morning Starshine"" that wasn't a clunkety recast of what was once a fine song. The others on this album vary in quality, though once in awhile such remakes can fool ya' and turn out to be pretty good. Papa K-Tel was no fool!"
1,"Nome and Seward Peninsula: History, Description, Biographies and...","I was extremely disappointed; and returned the book. It was a very poor copy;with hundreds and hundreds of pages either blank, or blurred. An impossible read."
4,Cinema Treasures,"Good information on classic movie theatres, however the standout is the many high quality pictures, with a number going over the page size of ten and a half by twelve and a half inches.The photos nicely depict the glorious days of early America."
2,This book is excellent,This book has very interesting pictures that corallate with the dissection very well.
4,Check before you buy,"Before you buy a replacement charger be sure that the one your replacing is really bad. After some use these chargers contacts get pressed down by the battery and as the charger ages eventually the contacts do not spring back enough to contact the batteries contacts. Take a small hook ands pull the contacts up, (respring them) and then try charging, it may be all you need to do."
1,Dremel 758D Charger,very misleading! i bought the 755 minimite dremel. i lost my charger. when you search for another charger you come up with this! it is the wrong one and does not fit. ...
3,Hilarious but marred by poor reproduction,"I loved the material, but I wish the publishers had taken some care in reproducing the strips. Most look as if they are poor color copies of old Sunday papers. A very few appear to have been re-colored acceptably, but most are pretty darn sloppy."
1,damaged upon receipt,Unable to review product due to a cosmetic (chip in the head of the guitar) defect that apparently not noticed at the manufacturer.
5,This set is so worth it!,"This Klemp set is so rare and so good.It's got so much stuff on it. The 1955 complete Bach suites, (which by the way could be regarded as definitive!) It's got Klemperer's only other Handel recording (aside from his recording of the Messiah). It's not one of the well known Concerto Grosso, but it's a dark one and I can see why Klemp was drawn to it. It's also got a rare Cherubini overture which was recorded in one take, the Gluck Iphegenie overture and Klemp's own Rameau variations. The Bach is in excellent mono and the rest is in stereo. The booklet notes explain the nature of these recordings, which is very enjoyable to read and know about.It's pretty well full price, but it's so good and so worth it!"
1,dolla morte,this is dumb waste of time. the hole idea is a big joke. i wish i did not waste my time.
4,Great Beginners Guide to Excel 97!,"This book is an excellent guide to help beginners learn Excel 97. This book was used in my Excel Class. It shows you (with tons of pictures) step by step how to use all the basic features of Excel, and some of the advanced features as well.Another reviewer had it right. Another few exercises and I would have been totally satisifed."
5,Great for the Classroom,As an instructor who teaches Excel 97 in a classroom environment I find this book to be an excellent textbook for my students. The book describes how to use Excel 97 in an easy to understand manner using simple explanations and great graphics. I highly recommend this book.
3,Wouldn't recommend it for dog nail trimming.,"I bought this Dremel because it was recommended as a good dog nail trimmer for fearful dogs. My older dog goes spastic at having her nails trimmed and I had hoped she would let me use this to trim her nails. She did not, as hard as I tried. I think it is because it is too loud. I would not recommend this for any dog that has fears of nail trimming. This tool is not the answer."
4,drummel,"Seems to be a very good item. I am using it to trim my dogs toenails.But some of the discs arrived broken, I didn't call it in, just figured it was only 4 of the little flat disc things wouldn't be worth it to you to send to me. But the item seems to be good for what I intended it to be for. thanks. Brenda"
3,not what I expected,I purchased this dremel primarily for trimming my dogs nails. It is noisier than expected. It does not have a nail guard like the peticare.I read reviews before purchasing this. I am still learning to use this tool; the owners manual is good ;the cutting tools do not do the things I wanted it to do. I am a chainsaw carver and I was hoping to use the dremel for detail work. I don't beleive I have the attachments capable of those procedures.
3,NOISY!!,"My gosh, I thought this would be perfect for the dogs nails. Especially based on the reviews. This thing is so loud on full speed even I flinch. On low speed it is tolerable but still freaks the dogs out with the sound. I didn't expect a battery operated device to be so LOUD!"
5,Nice to have around,"This product does exactly what it says it will do. The only problem I had was due to my own stupidity! After I figured out how to get the collet with the accessory I wanted to use together, it was fine. I'm sure I will use this tool for quite a few of my projects around here."
3,Good but,Good tool just for small jobs. 30 minutes or lessDremel should make the cordless just an option.I think corded is so much better.
3,Weak effort.,"I understand that the battery version won't have the power of the wired versions, but this is a very weak effort.I've actually exchanged two of them already at my local Huge Grey Store due to what I thought was defective performance. Apparently, this is just normal.The battery never lasted me through much more than 15 minutes of use, which defeats the utility of being able to use it away from an outlet. A month or tow later it only gives my low speed on a full charge.I love Dremels, but this thing is only really usable on soft woods and plastics. Forget sanding details on hardwoods or etching metals."
3,Good idea to buy a second battery,"I bought this tool specifically to do my dogs' nails. It does a great job. The only two draw backs: #1 - the battery doesn't always last for all 4 feet, especially if they have gotten a little overgrown. And since we have 3 large dogs, I can't get more than one dog done at one sitting. I have ordered a second battery so I will always have a backup ready to go. #2 - the battery sometimes won't stay attached properly unless I fiddle with it. I'm not sure if it's the battery, or the unit. Overall though, for what I'm using it for it does what I want."
4,"Good basic tool, but watch...","This is a great tool for anyone needing to drill, polish, cut, grind, etch, sand, screw, etc.... but not for big projects. If you have larger projects, consider purchasing a more powerful, corded Dremel. But for crafts and basic home repair, this product works great.The battery pack is easy to get on and off, and holds a charge well. (a back up battery is a good idea with ANY product!)The only thing I can really say I'd improve on, would be the on/off switch. I don't like that it goes High/Off/Low rather than Off/Low/High, for safety reasons. I have, on more than one occassion (while trying to switch tips) switched the unit on. There is no well defined seperation between the Lo/Off/Hi.Otherwise, I am quite happy with it and the accessories it came with."
3,Useful for small jobs,Overall a good useful tool for light duty use only. Battery life is very short and the cutting wheels are delicate. I've pretty much destroyed all my wheels and stones putting the dremel to tasks which it obviously can't handle. The case is rugged and holds lots of bits and attachments.I plan to purchase a corded dremel for those more ambitious jobs.
3,Know your purpose--not for doggy toes,"I bought this tool from another company as a dog nail grinder. However, there are other Dremels better suited for this purpose. Also the product specs on Amazon are not always correct--double check first on the Dremel web site. This tool is currently spec'ed for 10K and 20K rpm. For puppy dogs slower is better as the friction is less and the nail does not get hot as quickly. Best tool would be something around 5K rpm. I think that's the slowest they sell. Some reviewers complained about the 8000-01 Lithium-Ion Cordless so maybe the 7800-02 9.6V Cordless MultiPro is a good bet, though I have seen good reviews on the 750-02 MINIMITE Cordless Tool however it's slow speed is 6500. BTW, specs for the 761-01 Pet Nail Grooming Kit are not online at Dremel so I can't confirm if the Amazon specs are correct, you need the owner's manual to do that. Thanks! and Good Luck!!"
5,dremel tool,"I had owned a dremel tool for years but it is electric, meaning you have to drag the cord around your work. I found myself not using it very much because of the cord problem.This tool is battery powered and two speed. In addition, it is very light weight making it easy to navigate your work.I found my foot doctor using this product to trim down nails and remove dry and cracked heel skin with the sandpaper attachment, which is shipped with the product. I highly recommend this product."
3,handy but be sure you know battery capacity,"This is a handy tool but the battery life is weak. For example, a battery on full charge will not last all the way through cutting a 2"" x 4"" hole in a metal downspout.If you decide you want this Dremel anyway, say because you value its small size, be sure to buy a spare battery."
2,It depends on what you want to do with it.,"I bought this recently and figured 20,000 rpms would be more than enough for what I would do around my apartment. Well I guess not? Anything I attempt to cut stops the tool from cutting completely. The battery dies in about an 30 minuts of heavy use.I would suggest going with something corded, or a 10.8v battery."
2,not a powerful as I had hoped,"Its an OK dremel tool, but its not very powerful and the battery does not hold much of a charge. I have also had some issues with the on off switch. It is a three position switch and it will sometimes not work well. I need to move it back and forth between high and low to get it to go on. There are probably better units available."
1,Short on battery and power.,"I bought this tool for a variety of uses. The battery life is awful, 10 minutes of power at best. The power is far weaker than I thought(I have a great 7.2 volt drill that works fine). I am completely disappointed in this item. It will help you accomplish some tasks, if you have time to recharge every 10 mins or less and require no torque."
1,Worst Purchase EVER,What a waste of money! The battery doesn't last long enough to even get half a project done. Also the battery constantly pops out. Very pour design! My cheap rotary tool had to complete the job. I figured the Dremmel name would equal better quality. Man was I wrong. I will never buy another Dremmel brand rotary tool when I can get something for half the cost that works 1000 times better. Please take this junk off the market!
3,Missing 14 Cutting heads. Check yours!,"First, this was my mistake not to check/count the 50 accesories when I got the order.I needed a tool to groom my small dogs' nails and decided to purchased this more powerful tool so that I could it for other uses 19 monhts ago.Now I want to use this to cut a metal and while reading the manual I found that the package should have 50 accesories, which includes 15 of cutting heads (#409) and 2 of #420, but apparently there are only 2 of #409 and 1 of #420 in the box.I know I did not loose them because I only used them a few times and kept them well in my office.I am so disappointed that the package misseed many of them.I like the tool very much but determine to post and give it 3 stars for missing many (14) items.So it would be worth to check your inventory that you have the complete 50 accessories."
2,short lasting battery and no power at all,"Pros:-small and cheapCons:-Long charge time required-Ni-Cd batteries inside can't provide enough power to the motor-motor is not nearly powerfull enough for anything harder than plastic or wood-fully charged batteries are running dry in 7-10 min of continuous work-switch design is VERY BAD. it's tended to turn itself ON from slightest touch - very dangerous if you have some cutting head installed at that time.CONCLUSION: don't buy it for your kids, and if you need to work with it for more than just 5 min - then take a corded version and look for more power too, because this obe sucks real bad"
4,Cool Toy,"This toy is really cool and my 2 year old loves it. We love the way it swivels around and is very realistic. I am not quite sure how durable it is yet as the very first day we had it, my little boy popped the door off repeatedly (and lost it). It is not made of hard plastic, kind of a more pliable type, so not sure how much wear and tear it will withstand. Perhaps best used in a sand box instead of in dirt or mud since it is not made of a very strong plastic."
3,Did Not last - but loved.,"I got this toy for my 2 year old that loves tractors and excavators - he has played with it almost every day since we got it. It has been 5 months - and it is always breaking. The plastic parts are just not meant for the wear that kids put on these types of toys - and if is wasn't an expensive toy I might understand. I really thought this was a top of the line product though, so I was surprised.Needless to say I am going to buy another one because the kids love it. But I don't like replacing a toy after 5 months."
3,"good basic lessons, bad music and hair","The lessons are part straight forward lessons on scales, chords and other essentials. The other part that is interspersed is the instructor playing on a keyboard, emphasizing timing. The problem is that the music he plays is very bad, it makes elevator muzak seem like Mozart! Also, this guy has one of the most unsettling hair cuts I have ever seen. Apparently he does not get out much, as he has a pale sickly complexion."
4,Kudos To Madonna,"Ok, in some ways I'm a conservative and have never really been accustomed to stuff like this, but ""Justify My Love"" was truly innovative. Madonna presented a sexual fantasy in the form of a music video and it is to this day, probably one of the most famous music videos in history. The video networks still refuse to play it uncut. The video itself plays around with sexual experimentation in an almost cheeky manner *my favorite scene is Madonna watching two men make out in front of her, a big huge grin on her face that she quickly covers up.* This video paved the way for Madonna's ultra-sexy ""Erotica"" period.Yes, it may seem vulgar and yes, it is definitely NOT for children and Madonna has said that repeatedly, but ""Justify My Love"" was very much an expression of artistry. The cool thing is that Madonna left that phase of her career in the early 90's and has not dwelled on her whole sexual beast persona which was the smart thing to do. Janet Britney and Christina....take note. ;)"
3,Strange.... strange..... strange.....,"Not her best.... not her worst... but not worth the money. This song gets very annoying, the words are repititous, over and over and over. Its ashame because I don't like giving any of her Cd's any less than five stars, but I couldn't deny that this just didn't deserve five stars, or four. Even if you like ALL of her Cd's, you probably won't like this."
1,Justify my love-Madonna,no doubt Madonna performance is good but to spend that much of money for 5 mins program is not worth it.
5,Off the hook!!!!!!,"I love it! Nobady can ever come close madonna when it comes to being sexual/ What you see in todays videos, isnt shooking, Madonna took the world there first, open doors for what was a NO NO at time, that now everybody tries to doit. GO MAMA MADONNA"
4,A naughty little book that went unnoticed,"I came across this book about 25 years ago. My roommate and I giggled and laughed and thought this was the funniest book ever written. Nothing else written by Lawrence Block that I have read even comes close to hinting at the warped, devlish sense of humour found in this book. If you can find it, buy it."
4,I laughed out loud -- and blushed like a schoolgirl!,"This is one of the funniest books I've ever read. I had to stop reading a couple of times because I was laughing out loud on the shuttle bus or in the building lobby. I must confess I wasn't prepared for the many graphically sexual passages. It's pretty heavy stuff, and definitely could be labeled pornographic in some circles. As a result, I'd be rather careful about whom I recommended it to."
4,Funny Lady!,I like Wanda. I like her on standup and I like her on TV shows she has been in. This DVD is funny and I love the part about the drunk thing - driving home and following the friend.... will make you laugh for sure! She is funny - pretty outspoken of course... kind of political yes - but that is her choice. I buy it for the comedy!
3,Love Wanda - but this was a weird DVD,"This was obviously a made for television production, and transferred to a DVD minus commercials. Every so often the program is interrupted as if going to a commercial break and then coming back from break. I would've enjoyed this more if it would've flowed like a normal DVD."
5,Soooooooooo funny.,"Netflix suggested this DVD to me. She is so right on, about every day foibles, how people are.I describe her as a realist - she accurately observes and parodies how the average everyperson thinks. I think it is much harder to do something special with the ordinary.She does not make fun of celebrities or take cheap shots at outrageous people. That would have been the easier route: mention the extraordinary. Sykes does not."
2,Not the funniest I've seen of Wanda,"Normally, I find Wanda Sykes hilarious. Her voice alone (similar to Chris Rock's in a way) can drive me to hysterics. But in this DVD, I just wasn't that amused. A couple laughs here and there but overall, meh."
1,Not funny....,"I dont find Wanda Sykes funny at the best of times, but a friend who had this dvd showed it to me and I only lasted about 10 minutes before turning it off.Possibly the least funny and overrated female comedian of all time..."
5,LOOK AT IT !!,"After seeing Wanda at the Irvine CA Improv last month, I decided I must own everything Wanda. Both her and Keith Robinson rocked -- go see them live if you have a chance.I knew I'd seen two Wanda specials, and I looked everywhere for the other one and had no luck; could only find Tongue Untied. Guess what??? BOTH are on this DVD !Her half hour Comedy Central special is included in the bonus material of this disk !!Hercules - Hercules - Hercules !"
3,"Great styling...poor construction on this one, though.","Bought this for my wife just before Christmas. I think I got a bad run of these, as she noticed that part of the lining hadn't been sewn in properly, and had torn itself loose. The rest of the bag is fine, but this one is being returned."
5,The Best Country Singer Alive Bar None,"Ray Hood is the best country singer alive today. His voice and his songwriting skills are rich,smooth and emotional. This is the real deal."
3,LOTS of noise and static,"Absolutely adorable and seemingly well-made as there are no flimsy parts that I could see. Colorful, attractive, cute as Hello Kitty usually is. I assume this is just a faulty one. I will have to take it back to the store for a refund, then try to order another one online since they dont have it in the store. I bought this for my 5 year old daughter's birthday cuz she loves to call her auntie's and grandparents on her own. She was thrilled by it, but sorely disappointed in its defect. We tried everything we knew of that would remedy the noise: new batteries, followed written directions, plugged it into different outlets in the house. Otherwise, it seems to be a great product."
5,Excellent Service,"The CD I ordered arrived on time, and in excellent condition.I'm very pleased with the service. Jesse Walton"
3,A Third Party Read,"I agree with the ""Booklist"" review; it just doesn't quite soar. While I feel that it whet my whistle to want to learn more about these early female aviators, my need was not solely satisfied by reading this book alone. The author's approach is not to my liking; she basically quotes OTHER books and only gleens the smallest bits of information about each aviator. I was hoping to delve into the lives of these incredible women, but instead felt like I saw their lives from 40,000 feet. I definately felt like I was getting my information ""second hand"". If you are doing a book report (I'd say grammar school level), beginning research into aviation, or want a simple, light read, THEN this book may be the one for you. If you want to really step into the cockpit and play co-pilot, I'm sure there are better books out there for you to put your hands around."
5,Mikes Review,The figures are very detail and fun to collect. These figures are the best and is a good thing to come for this century.
2,Not the same as picture!,"The stuffed horse I recieved looks nothing like the toy pictured online. The legs are longer, he face is shaped differently, and the tail is a different color! I would never guess it was the same toy. I'm disappointed with my order - I feel cheated by the inaccurate pictures online."
5,Grand daughter LOVES it!,"I purchased this as a present for my 3 year old granddaughter who loves horses! She hasn't put it down since she opened it, so I th.ink she loves it!It arrived in a quick manner and in good shape"
3,Boring,I don't know why the producers of this DVD thought that watching wallpaper patterns change excruciatingly slow would be interesting. But that's the video for the entire album. There are also individual videos for each song which are equally boring. Some look like high-school multimedia projects.This is not as revolutionary as the Rings Around The World DVD which had interesting videos for each song.The music however is very good and is one of SFA's best recordings. Get the CD instead. Your not missing anything without this DVD.[DW]
5,Cool Behind the Scenes Look! Recommended,"This short is a behind the scenes look at the steps what went into making one of the very funny scenes from ""Horton Hears a Who (Widescreen and Full-Screen Single-Disc Edition)"". If you saw the movie, you might remember the bridge scene where Horton carries the Who world across a very unstable bridge, while the Mayor of Whoville is getting dental work done. This ""Anatomy of a Scene"" takes you through the thinking and story boarding that took place to get the final piece.Very worthwhile for fans of animation.Recommended!"
4,How do they do that?,"For what it is, it is a good, inside look at how this particular scene came to be. Not edge of the chair entertainment, it never-the-less was well worth the look see."
3,Not the movie.,"I thought this was something else entirely. While the featurette was enjoyable,it certainly wasn't the movie. My grandson was disappointed."
3,It was ok,"I ordered this book for my class which I am currently taken. My professor stated that ""this was one of the best linear algebra books out there."" I am on my second day of the course so I do not know for myself how good it is. The book was in rougher shape than I expected."
4,A really fine Wes album,"I'm a jazz guitarist and huge Wes Montgomery fan. It's interesting to see the number of reviews given each of Wes' individual albums. Some have multiple reviews, and this had two before mine. Say what? This is a great Wes album. Are people not aware of it? Whatever, maybe the fact that it is a ""Montgomery Brothers"" session and not a ""Wes"" session has thrown it off the radar. For me, this is a topshelf ""Wes"" album. There always seemed to be something special about the albums he did with his brothers. It's said that Wes never felt comfortable in the studio, and perhaps having his brothers on the session loosened him up a bit. I like all the cuts, but standouts, for me, are ""Doujie"", which may have the greatest Wes octave solo, ever, ""Delirium"", ""Bock To Bock"" and ""Grooveyard"". In my opinion, if you are a Wes fan, you buy this album. Any really fine Wes Montgomery album is better than the best by most any other jazz guitarist."
3,Not THAT good,"The first time I read this book, I really liked it and would have probably given it 4 stars. But once I read it again, I started thinking about how the other woman would feel. She didn't know Daniel is married (he doesn't talk about his wife and you wonder if he wears his wedding ring, but probably not because as I said, the other woman doesn't know he's married) and he dines her out. (DON'T READ ON IF YOU DON'T WANT SPOILERS). That she says something happened between them is just a way of saving face. Michelle tries to make Lydia out like an evil villian but if you look at it at Lydia's perspective, she's just like any other single woman. Despite my problems with this book, I still liked it because Michelle is a good story teller, and the characters are believable, and I just want Daniel and Rachel to get back together because it is so obvious they love each other. That Daniel is willing to make amends and does so a great deal of time in the book saves it from being a total disaster."
1,doubt if I ever hated a book more,"I have read a lot of romance novels in my time, but this book can hardly be called a romance book even though it's published by Harlequin and labelled as such. I found it difficult to deal with how spineless Rachel is throughout the entire book. She doesn't evolve at all as a character and puts up with just about anything from her cheating spouse, Daniel.Frankly, I wanted to see her have the guts to take her children and leave her husband. What kind of hubby doesn't tell others he's married and keeps his wife and family secret? A bad one.Sure, the book has a sweet ending when a huge revelation is bestowed on the reader, but after 95% of the book having me hate Daniel, it just left me wondering why I wasted time with the entire story. He could've told her the truth about the other woman a whole lot sooner.Sorry, but I hate really weak female characters. I can't believe she continued to sleep with her hubby after he admitted to cheating. What the heck!"

3,good ideas but no directions,There are some really interesting ideas for storage and great photographs. No specific instructions for making the projects but informative chapters about several designers and the process they went through to make their pieces.
4,California Games,This game is very different than nes version it has 5 events than 6 but still it is very good game.
1,Low End JUNK,"I purchased one of these to make my dremel into a drill press for wood - mostly softwood and it has been a terrible experience. The collars that attach the tool do not allow for perfect square alignment and the dremel many times cant seat a bit so there is no wobble. I was disappointed with this tool. I found that MicroMark makes a small hobby drill press (as well as other great tools) that is sturdy, reliable and excellent. It maycost more then the dremel but you do get what you pay for."
2,A clunky accessory for a great tool,"What's the real value of a Dremel? Fine work. (If I need to drill a big hole, I use a big drill.) I use the Dremel with fine drill bits to drill very small holes. That's when I need the steadiness a drill press provides. But the Dremel drill press attachment has way too much play in its various parts and consistently snaps off fine drill bits. My 8"" Delta drill press has less play. For now, the Dremel drill press attachment awaits my next garage sale."
2,Not as useful as I thought,"Attaching the Moto-tool to the unit is very clunky. A removable plastic ring keeps the moto-tool in place. I could see easily losing this little part in the workshop. Once set up, I couldn't find anything I could use a drill press this small for. Instead, I just reach for my regular hand-held drill."
4,The West Wing with speed lines.,"North Korea just attacked South Korea. China plans to do the same with Taiwan. The good ole USA and Russia are planning to gain something out of this mess. Who can save us? The newly elected president of Japan, of course.So yeah, as you can guess, it's a book about politics. Japanese politics to be exact. The book does a great job of explaining the reader how politics work in Japan today and what the author wants to change, so you won't get lost if your only experience with Japanese politics is the Ministry of Giant robots and tentacle porn.While the book is actually very entertaining, you get the feeling that the president of Japan only looks smart because every other Japanese politician that stands against him in this book has the IQ of a mongoloid clam. Other than that, I have no complains about this book. The story is very entertaining and the art fits perfectly (please ignore the very very ugly cover)."
3,Now I'm Ready!,Even though I won't be attending college until the year 2003 this book tells me a lot of things I need to know or should know before going to college. there were Some things about college that i didn't know until reading this book!
5,As easy to use as writing with a pen,Got this after a break in to etch all of our valuables with our name. Easy to use as writing with a pen. Inexpensive and does the job.
3,TOO LOUD,Shakes extremely bad and is very loud but did work good and variable speed with the diamond bit is nice.
5,A necessary addition to any tool collection,"You wont have any desire for an engraver until you loose something. When you eventually do, the Dremel lives up to its rotary reputation. This is much easier to use than other engravers which make it difficult to make out your own name after you've engraved it. So for any hope of you're lost item being recovered, use this."
4,Great Tool & Easy to use,"I bought this product engrave the name of my children in the things that they bring to school or friends' homes. Previously I wrote the names with a soldering iron but it was very difficult to handle and was not very good results. With this tool I can easily write on many materials, especially plastic and aluminum (It's what I use most). The only fault I find is that it makes too much noise, but friends have told me that is normal in this type of tool, but I still recommend it for simple jobs."
3,DREMEL 290 ENGRAVER,"Dremel engraver works pretty well now that I have managed to get it working, and yes it does what it says, BUT knowhere have I read where you have to buy an adaptor (polarised) to be able to use it.Cost me an extra 20 to buy before I could get engraving. Also the adaptor was hard to find, after trying several electrical stores I was eventually pointed in the right direction.The information regarding an adaptor SHOULD be includer in the technical information, Had I known the eventual cost would be over 50 pounds I probably wouldnt have purchased this tool."
3,Dremel,"The Dremel came in good shape. However, it was missing the engraving tip.So I am unable to use it.How can this be rectified?"
3,"Dremel tool seems fine, template not well made","According to one review on this tool, it didn't come with an engraving bit so I purchased the engraving kit. It DOES come with the proper bit so don't waste your money purchasing the rotary tool engraving kit.I'm disappointed in the stencil as it is not going to stand up well as it is made from a plastic like substance. Tried to find a metal stencil and am not having any luck.If you don't need precision letters, this tool is fine."
5,Pleased,"I am pleased with the purchase. It is able to scribe into all the items that I needed it to- iTouch, Kindle, Harddrives, and other hard surfaced items. The multiple settings are also helpful to adjust for the density of the item engraved."
4,Nice and does the job!,Works nice and good price on Amazon. I was able to engrave in lots of stuff like metal even with the tip that comes with the tool.
5,Works just as it should,"I engraved my guns, laptop, tools, tvs, video game systems etc, all with the included bit and it worked great. Depending on the setting and material, I was generally able to write as I would with a pen."
2,Built to Last? NOT,"I recently purchased this item and went to use it for the first time. After securely fastening the engraving tip I began to engrave on a metal surface. After about 5 minutes of use, the set screw that holds the carbide tip in the unit came out. I went to replace the screw and found that what threads were available to grab and hold the screw in place had stripped. It appears that there are not enough threads to hold the tip in place and/or the metal the base is composed of is just not hard enough to hold the screw. It doesn't make sense that a device designed to vibrate at 7,200 strokes per minute (120 per second) would have a hardened carbide tip but the base that holds it wouldn't be designed to withstand the force (the base looks like to be POT metal)"
2,do not know,I do not know yet how this product works as mine did NOT come with the drill bit. Apparently by some reviews some did and some did not. Mine did not. Now I have to purchase this and the screwdriver to put it in.
1,Missing engraver point,Wouldn't know whether it works or not because the package had no engraver tip. I'm not in the mood for 100 bucks worth of time and hassle with Amazon customer service to retrieve a 5 dollar item which I paid for and didn't receive in a sealed package. Somewhere there should be a bricks-and-mortar store which has the engraver point which I can still get before Christmas.
1,Assembly required,"It arrived 99.9 % assembled except for the major part- The engraving bit. To assemble it you need to loosen one of the smallest screws I have ever seen, Insert the bit and then tighten. No tool to loosen this small screw was supplied. So sadly instead of being able to use it from the package I need to head to the depot to find the world's smallest screw driver. I don't have one that small in the tool box. Rated 1 for this inconvenience."
1,items not shown in pictures,"the item i was sent is not the item shown in the picture. the item that was sent to me is 290-05 if that item is even right mt package has 290-01 on it! these items are noot matching up to the item codes and also the pictures !Dremel 290-01 1.15 Amp 7,200 Stroke Per Minute Engraver includes Letter and Number TemplateDremel 290-05 120-Volt Engraver IndustrialDremel (DRE290) Variable Speed Electric Engraver<-this is the one i ordered and didn't receive."
2,Heavy and NOT for glass,"Although dremels might be good tools, this one is weighted such that it torques your wrist. There is a grey nonslip finger grip near the front, but then nearly eleven ounces in the bulky part up and over your hand making it clumsy. Furthermore, it states it does glass, but do not expect to do any freehand work (like signing) without a boring bulky template."
4,it's ok,I could not figure out how to use the letter and number template so i called the manufactor and he said to hold ingraver straight up and follow the guide . It's really to small to fool with .I purchased the diamond tip to use on glass and only use it to hand engrave things around the house with my ss no. on them for theft.
2,awkward,I was looking for an engraver that gave me control and a decently smooth cut for writing on metal. This tool is awkward to hold (can't get a comfortable grip) and it doesn't penetrate the metal very deeply. It is also quite loud and obnoxious to work with. I was disappointed and I still look for an at home engraver that performs to quality standards.
5,Great For A Learner!,I wanted to learn engraving so I bought this little inexpensive tool. The first thing I ever did turned out really well. I engraved a hummingbird and a flower on a glass. Since then I have engraved names on stainless covered books and frames. A little loud but works well for me.
3,no tip!?,"i bought this , disregarding other peoples no tip claims. i got screwed. i didn't get a tip either, annoying."
4,"Handy, easy to use","I use this to engrave my name or initials on some things for identification in case it's stolen or would get mixed up with someone elses, like my garmin running watch. I also engrave the back of my marathon medals with my time. I didn't find the template usable, and I don't have the skill to make the numbers look professional, but it's good enough for me. I practiced on some scrap medal and pretty quickly gained confidence that it would look decent. Just grip it like a pen and don't be in a hurry. It works best for me to lock my hand and wrist and move my arm--less likely for the engraver to slip that way."
4,Not bad,"I liked the engraver. It shipped to my home within a few days, and it wasn't hard to put together or use. I would advise to have a small screwdriver on hand (like the one you find in a eyeglass repair kit or something as small ). I think it is a bit noisy, so if you don't like the noise, it's not for you. But overall, for my first engraving tool, I like it!"
1,Absolutely Useless,"There isn't really much to the story I have for this product, because I didn't even get a chance to fully use it.Took it out of the packaging and followed the instructions. There's a small screw you're supposed to tighten in the head of the engraver that keeps the tip in place. Well, A) the screw was too big and B) the screwdriver required wouldn't tighten it anymore. Tried out the tool and not even three seconds after starting an engraving the tip fell out. Tried it three more times, and each time it kept happening.I love Dremels, but I hate this product. Worthless."
1,missing part,"Did not get point tip with unit,so unable to use engraver. I will be ordering a tip.will update review when I get tip."
5,Works at all Levels,"Last year when I became a first year Head Coach of a 7-8 year old team I was looking for an offense that would be powerful, fun, and easy to learn. The first book I bought was this book and I stopped there. This book gives you everything you need to run the offense.It is well written and easy to understand. The diagrams can be taken directly from the book and used as is without any quess work. The program I took over had only won 3 games in 6 years. Last year the team went 5-2-1 and outscored the other teams 103 to 51 (8 game season) and posted 3 shutouts.This book worked for me and it will work for you!Good Luck,Coach Steve"
3,works ok,"Too much play in the mount to really keep a nice edge, not recommeneded for anything much heavier than balsa."
4,Slick Action,"I have been a craftsman for 50 years and wish I had had this tool all of that time. It makes small, complicated designs turn out to the desired degree of finish. If you are a model or prototype maker I cannot see how you would consider not having this tool in your workshop. Thanks Amazon for offering this tool in your inventory!"
2,Dangerous and inefficient,becareful when using unstable and needs to make a jig for. dremel may fallout of holder and at high speeds it wobbles and make cut incorrectly. Better to buy and use the bigger more reliable models.
2,"As Others Have Stated, Too Much Flex","This router table accessory has the potential to be a fine addition to any hobbyist's Dremel tool collection, but unfortunately the execution of the concept is not up to Dremel's usual standards.As many others have posted, I was disappointed with the amount of flex in the mount used to connect the Dremel to the underside of the table. The results of too much flex are uneven cuts when trying to use the fence.I think the flex would be less of an issue when doing work without the fence."
2,Early Adapter,"In the product info it says that this item will fit a Dremel 300 and the photos actually show it on this product with the use of the ""early adapter"" or the adapter for earlier models of Dremel products. The item does not, however, ship with the adapter to make it work for the Dremel 300 as the Product info and photo imply."
3,Dremel Router Table,"This is a pretty good table for routing or sanding. I wish Dremel had some longer drum sander accessories. This would make a great little spindle sander on small projects. The height adjustment is not very easy to use. However, the table worked very well once it was ""locked in"". I would have been willing to spend a bit more for a better engineered table."
2,Not as Shown on the Box,"I got this and am really not too thrilled. Let's look at my list of gripes:1. What you actually GET is NOT what is shown in this illustration or even on the box. This tool does NOT come with the pictured tool holder that provides additional stabilization and support. Even though the holder is CLEARLY shown and there is an insert about it in the box, it ain't there.Without the holder, your Dremel is ponly attached to the ""table"" with a a collar at the top of the tool that is secured with e hex nut. This leaves the body of the tool unsupported and that much linear mass makes for easy deflection when working harder woods.2. Once you have mounted the ""table"" to a support surface correctly mounting the tool into the holder is a real challenge (I guess I have big fingers)3. The precision of the fence and depth adjustments is really hit or miss as most of the assenbly is plastic.Overall I give it a 2 -- mostly for false inducement."
2,Dremel,"I purchased this item for the portability of the product, the same reason I purchased the dremel tool, and drill press (work station). It allows me to carry my tools with me on my motorhome trips, and performs as well if not better than full size benchtop tools. I am very pleased with dremel and its products"
1,Don't buy this. It is not up to the usual Dremel tool quality,It's good for edging and such. But it is no good for cutting groves or if you want to square up a piece to trim an edge. The dremel tool mount flexes too much and you end up with a really sloppy cut. Use the router attachment and make your own table. Do not buy this. Shame on you Dremel. I've seen better tools from Playschool.
4,good for small tasks (obviously),product is a good addition to my dremel collection. ONE WARNING: tool models 400 and 800 require a special adaptor! Dremel corp will send you one at their expense-you just need to call them. other than that the accessory rocks!
1,This will destroy your tool,"I'd stay away from this one until the design flaws are fixed. Tons of sawdust from the piece you're working on will fall into your tool and render it useless. I've killed two Dremels, and got maybe a grand total of 5 minutes use out of the table."
1,Poorly-made Chinese plastic garbage.,"I wish I didn't have to make such a vicious statement, but this thing really is poorly-constructed junk. The tool mount flexes too much to guarantee any accuracy in your work. What's worse, on the one I had the tool didn't even mount centered in the hole - preventing me from ever using any wide router or sanding bits without damaging the plastic of the table itself.If there were an adjustment - a pair of slots of some sort - to which I could center the tool properly, I would have kept the table and given two or three stars. At least it would have been somewhat useful to me. I just don't see how a plastic molded part can get this wrong, and for that I returned it.I don't expect too much from a rotary tool system like this, the quality is cheap and you get what you pay for - but this is ridiculous."
3,Good for the price,"The item is a low cost way to do small routing work. I obtained it to make marionette controls. But, be aware that the item is not usable as a stand-alone router. You must screw it to a wood surface. The attaching of the Dremel tool is not very quickly done, so it is not really practical to keep switching between using the Dremel in the router and as a hand held tool.-Joe Dunfee"
3,Good but not great.,"This router table is a pretty good idea for creating new uses for your Dremel tool. It seems fairly well built as far as durability. It is on the other hand a bit flimsy during use. I found that as you feed material in, the blade can get pushed over causing an uneven cut or shape. Definitely not a router but fun for very small projects."
3,"Good for balsa, OK for softwood","I am using this for model airplane parts, and it does the job for me. It is made out of plastic, and the Dremel holder itself is not very rigid, so one cannot exert too much force and expect precision. Having said that it is infinitely better than trying to do routing without a routing table. Within it's limitations it does well. I have used it on fairly soft woods as well as balsa, and if one is gentle it's fine.The price on Amazon was excellent. With the caveats above I would recommend it to a friend."
2,An Absurd Book,"For those of you tempted to buy a book whose author claims to have worked out a forced win for White against the Grunfeld and several other defenses, I strongly recommend that you read the independent reviews by John Watson and Jeremy Silman at chesscafe.com, where the specifics of much of Berliner's bad analysis and megalomaniacal pontificating are spelled out in detail. In my case, I found the book to be a slightly amusing exercise in debunking crackpot science (which is why I gave it two stars). I'm sure that there will be several others who will agree with me that this may just be the most preposterous chess book ever written. If, however, you're the sort of person who watches PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE every time it's on TV, calls the Psychic Friends Network regularly and thinks professional wrestling is for real, this book is right up your alley."
2,"Some good opening tips buried in dogmatic, pointless theory",Some very good ideas and tips on openings can be found in an otherwise dogmatic and desperate attempt to turn the rich and dynamic game of chess into an equation. There are interseting opening recomendations but not enough to play them in tournaments.
3,no GM over the board,"I don't think Hans Berliner is a GM over the board, but I am sure there is not a US class Senior Grandmaster. I haven't read the book, but it is interesting and I will buy it. The book is available for 3 weeks now in local bookstores and still not available from Amazon.com!"
1,Worth reading for one only reason... you understand how denialism works,"I've just finished reading Lewy's book and was disappointed as it remains way below the standard set by his previously published works. Its faults and shortcomings are obvious, especially to the historians among his readers. Given the numerous factual errors, which demonstrate his ignorance of the subject matter, one has to seriously ask oneself, if he has not been set up by some denialist group. My advice: Read it, but read it alongside with the source material (in the original language) and you'll understand how pseudo-scientific denialism is constructed."
3,The Armenian relocation: The true history behind it,"it is a good book, overall.it shows the reader the real history behind what really happened with the Armenians, Turks, Kurds, etc. before,around, and after WWI.the most balanced view, yet. other books are either toooooooooooo pro or tooo con.in the end, a clear cut view to ppl who wana know history and not science fiction. the relocation of the armenian ppl did happen, fact [period].!a good view on the Armenian side, too. With the Armenian terrorists tryin to rally support for their cause even terrorizing their own kind (killin).u always learn something new, this is a good one."
5,an unbiased account,"Well written, easy to read and finally, an unbiased account of the Armenian massacres.The author is scrupulous in his assessment of the documents presented by both sides.Guenther Lewy tries to authenticate all the availabletestimony written and oral. He does not try to whitewash the Turks or discredit the Armenians. An excellent review of the materials available as of now."
1,Eternal Damnation of the Spotless Mind (Bernard-Henry Lévy),"Too smart to be worth its price. Endless discussion of figures, demographic developments, obsessed with proving a dogma the reader already knows before turning the first page - but after spending his money :)There never was a mass murder of Christian Armenians in Turkey!And Conservative Muslims of Panislamist ideology never intended to torture their second class non-muslim citizens.And Young Turkish Nationalists (Westernized Pre-Modern Turks) never had realized how close they came to complete and successfull extinction of the hated Armenian race by sheer coincidence of tragic events nobody was responsible for.The whole Turkish Genocide which could/would/should be non-existant, is as regrettable as the author's mindset.Very poor ethics BUT very creative writing!"
1,Money talks: this author is funded by the Turkish government,"The Turkish government has been paying various so-called scholars to write books and articles ""proving"" the Armenian Genocide never happened. The author of this book is one of those paid scholars. Enough said!"
1,Mr. Lewy denies the Armenian Genocide,"Another typical work of someone who got paid by Turkey to write a book about a event, which is now recognized all over the world. Don't buy this book."
3,"counterpoints in ""genocides""","We had this book and a book by a scholar named David Irving added to our school history course module on ""genocides."" Historians like Guenter Lewy and David Irving add context and help explain events that have only been told in the past from one side.Lewy and Irving explain words like ""genocide"" and ""holocaust"" are politically charged and extreme and part of an older and incomplete way of looking at events and creating mythologies where ""one side"" is blamed. They also debunk the way statistics have been exagerated. In fact no one is a ""victim.""These old prejudices and laoded charges like ""genocide"" and ""holocaust"" will one day fade from the langauge of history. This is a good start. Thank you Mr. Lewy."
1,"There was no Holocaust, no Armenian Genocide, and the earth is flat...","I cannot but be amazed by the great lengths the author goes to corrode and replace the reality of one of the most horrible massacres in the living memory. Part of the problem is that the general public has to rely on historians to comment on what has happened more than few years ago; if everyone could see the historical records themselves this book would not be published - the evidence of the Armenian Genocide speaks for itself, sadly, many are determined not to listen."
1,Joke,"This books a joke, just like anything that comes out of the turkish denial machine. It contradicts itself on many levels."
1,Biased book,"This book is being sponsored by turkish government and it only allow's turkish view of the ARMENIAN GENOCIDE. The author can only present the turkish view, therefore this book is nothing but a propaganda drivel that turkish government paid for!!. I do not recommend this book or the author simply because he is being paid by turkish government, and he is not a true researcher."
4,Fits the Fujifilm X-Pro 1 and 35mm Lens (also 18mm lens),"Fits the Fujifilm X-Pro 1 and 35mm Lens. The stock lens hood barely fits, very tight fit, though. Also fits the 18mm lens with the Stock Lens hood in place, but the Rubber cap pulls off easily. Took off one star for the non removable tether. It's nice that it has an option for attaching a tripod mount or rubber o-ring to fit around a lens, but I would've liked the option to remove it temporarily. So I ended up cutting it off. It's really nice to have it as a protective case, and easily stuff it into my pocket when shooting. I don't want it dangling from my camera when shooting."
3,interesting but shallow,"Burgess is always worth a look, but this slim volume is not among his better works. He names 99 novels, from Joyce to Mailer, that he claims exemplify the best in the English language since 1939. Some of the selections are predictable (Finnegans Wake, Gravity's Rainbow), others may raise eyebrows (Goldfinger, Giles Goat Boy).Like all lists, Burgess' makes you wonder why one book is included while another is not. This is generally not a fruitful way of judging these works. Rather, the fault in Burgess' list is that his reviews of each book (usually less than a page each) are too brief to be of much value. In this volume we get to hear only the faintest murmur of what I'm sure was a great din of opinions on this outspoken writer's mind."
3,"written in 83, so it may be outdated","I'm not sure how to feel about this short book of burgess. i admire the man and his work, but you have to wonder about some of his choices. there are so many great books and authors that aren't included in his choices, though i could see the difficulty in picking one book a year. it is interesting to see how burgess' mind works, and the choices he makes, but it is only of interest of a burgess scholar."
1,stay away,"Lasted 8 pages. No joke. Cartridge was sucked dry after printing 8 pages of a fax. Nothing special, just a cover sheet and some text.Contacted seller, never heard back. Nothing 'premium' about this product."
5,Is Walmart Evil?,"If you don't know the answer to this question inform yourself through this painstakingly researched and thoughtful guide to one of the most influential companies in the world. Not only does Dicker recount the birth of Walmart, but also introduces you to the faces of the people behind this behemoth, whether a cashier or CEO. Dicker does a phenomenal job guiding you through the Walmart story. You learn of the technology that allows Walmart to squash their competitors, and how communities pull together in their fight against The Big-box and why. This book is not about bashing Walmart, it is trying to educate the public on who Walmart is, and what their impact is on our nation and the world."
4,Brilliant book. Great analysis and a few laughs.,"I loved this book. I think it's so engrossing because it gives you the straight dope on Wal-Mart as well as eye-opening analysis of why some opponents win and some lose. With a healthy sprinkle of good jokes along the way. If you want to really understand this issue, you'll be glad you read it."
2,Gritty language does not equal gritty reporting.,"Mr. Dicker seems to believe that peppering his text with foul language gives his work an edge. I can't decide if he is just trying to be hip, urbane or if his vocabulary is so limited he has no other option.If Mr. Dicker considers himself a serious writer, and apparently he does, he should concentrate on holding the readers' attention through solid writing and give up the crass language.I would not recommend this book for anyone expecting a thoughtful, carefully crafted critique of Wal-mart."
4,refreshing and challenging,Dicker brings something that is too often lacking to discussions of Wal-Mart and its effect on American labor and American communities: nuance. Don't be fooled by his occasionally too-jokey tone; he knows his material and recognizes that there are no easy solutions in a country that puts a bargain ahead of all other social goods. A thoughtful and intriguing short read.
2,Not sturdy enough,"Although the shoulder pads do the job, they are a bit flimsy and a chunk of one has already come off."
1,poor quality,I purchased 4 pair of these shoulder pads. They are extremely poor quality. Very flimsy. I wore one pair for 2 days and the bottom flap was so thin that it tore slightly on the first day and completely on the second wearing. I would not recommend them on the contrary.
1,Good for Drunk People,"I have to agree with War Eagle on this one.. The people leaving the 5 star reviews are full of it.. This is a GREAT movie if you and some friends want to get drunk and really laugh at something dumb.... Other than that, avoid it.. It's a classic flick that you would expect to see on Mystery Science Theatre 3000. Bad Bad Bad. Imagine an army of lil Black Cougar toys, set to attack hostle bad guys. Imagine the Cougarmobile, being a vette with green headlights.. Those are just 2 examples of why this was just silly. Bah."
1,BLACK COUGAR...I'm Confused????,Is this de flick where that old black lady MADEA be gettin her sumpin sumpin with dem College Frat Boyz down da street y'all???
4,A Different Sort of RPG,"Instead of the typical sword and sorcery role-playing game, Uncharted Waters makes you the captain of a small ship during the Age of Exploration. Game play is addictive and rarely frustrating. Patience and endurance will usually result in a satisfactory outcome, and your character will marry the princess and become the king of Portugal within 8-10 hours of game time. Random events include battles with pirates and storms, with more pirates and fewer storms the longer you play. The only limitations are in the results of the game -- aside from becoming a pirate yourself, you _will_ marry the princess and become king of Portugal. In some respects, the game is actually educational, especially in terms of geography. All in all, this is in the ""blast from the past"" category and worth picking up if the price is right for you."
5,Uncharted Water for PC Play,This was one of my favorite games. I was wondering if it comes in a format for a personal computer? Is there anything out there that is similar to Uncharted Waters for personal computer gaming?
5,wonderful epic Score by Johnny Green,"Finally, this is the complete score, limited edition to 3000 copies on 2-Disc's, which contains a informative 28-Page-Booklet.Disc One beginns with a wonderful ""Overture"" and ends with Track 17 ""First Act Finale"" (Roadshow). Disc Time 74:02Disc Two beginns with ""Entr'Acte"" end the official score ends with Track 7 ""Susanna's Death/Jeemie's Raintree/The Song of Raintree County"" with total Time 38:33.Disc Two contains with Track 8 - 25 some Bonus cues (Film versions, alternate, alternate endings, chorus versions etc.) with a lenght of 33:48. Total disc time 70:25What do you want more? What I can say more? it's a MUST HAVE IT! Its a wonderful orchestral score.Crazy: a DVD or Blu-Ray isn't released yet."
1,How small is your sheet music?,"OK - this thing is meant to hold music or lyrics on a mic stand. However, it is actually note card sized - 7"" wide X 5"" high, and has a 1"" shelf at the bottom. So if you expect to hold even a standard sheet of paper, you will be disappointed. I would not buy it again."
2,DON'T BOTHER BUYING THIS ONE,"I bought this little stand attachment hoping I could use it to hold a Boss AD-5 Acoustic Guitar preamp where I could get at the controls during performances. The platform is just about the right size, and I added a couple of velcro strips to keep the AD-5 in place. The AD-5 doesn't weigh a whole lot, but the tilting mechanism is really flimsey and doesn't lock in place very well. The clamp that holds the device to the microphone stand is a terrible design as it is a ""V"" shape and the set screw doesn't meet the tube at the proper angle to keep it from falling off. That being said, it would be ok for some sheet music, but the platform is way too small for anything except maybe a couple ""post it notes"". Way over priced and not even good for scrap metal. I cut the arm off and pop rivited the platform to an Atlas AD-11B female mic flange and a 4"" Posi Lok clutch. This product is a complete waste! Don't bother buying it."
2,Item not as displayed in picture,The music stand is not as it appears on the picture. The lip (or raised edge) is on the smaller edge (rather than the longer one).
5,Small but effective,I bought this for my husband. He loves it. It attaches securely to the mic stand with no problem. It's pretty small but that can actually have it's advantages. I'd say it's a little smaller than a dvd case.
2,To small...,It look a lot bigger in the picture than it is... Should have read the dimensions before buying... Oh well I learned my lesson...
5,Beautiful Album!,Love Susie's voice and lyrics. Another good CD from her. Speaks a good message without being preachy and in your face.
5,Great Christian Music,"Susie Luchsinger has long been a favorite of mine. She is the sister of Reba McIntire and sings some very meaningful Christian songs. Many of her songs have to do with family values, incorporating the love of family and Jesus. I have just about all of her albums and highly recommend them."
5,Susie touches your heart.,"Susie's music is always great. This CD reminds us that no matter the journey, God's hand is in it. His joy is present always!"
4,family at war,I remember this TV series of over 20 yrs ago set during the period at the start and during WWII. I enjoyed then and even more now It follows the lives of family members during this time the good and the bad.
3,"good start, but lacking.","I have been working with this course for a little while now and I have noticed that the vocabulary provided is lacking in some of the most basic words, such as the welsh word for english or mother. This can be remedied with a good dictionary, but shows the lack of forethought in planning the course. Also, the grammar sections are not as clear as I would have liked, I have seen much better jobs done with other teach yourself courses. That said,, this course does provide a good introduction to the Welsh language and phonetics for the absolute beginner."
2,Cardboard feel,This supposed luxury leather case feels more like cardboard. Save yr money. Not as nice as an identical one I bought a few years ago.
4,does what it should,"This is a great mouthpiece pouch, the only complaint would be the size. Its sometimes hard to fit in the little areas of a that a trombone case has now, but if you can fit it then its fine. Its very durable and protects the mouthpiece very well. It can also fit very large mouthpieces, like my Griego .5 Deco. If it could be a little smaller but still have the good protection of the mouthpiece I would have gave it 5 stars."
3,Does the job but I think the nylon protec pouch may be better,This is a decent mouthpiece pouch for the price (I got it for around $5) but I think the nylon one may be a better choice. The biggest difference is that it's a lot bulkier. This is mostly because of the leather and the shape in which the pouch is made. The magnetic enclosure also adds to this. Another detractor is that the leather is very cheap feeling but you do get what you pay for. All in all its an okay pouch but I would suggest the nylon protec pouch if they are at similar price points.
2,"good idea, bad product","my dd got this for xmas. we both very excired because she loves to dance to the wiggles. it was very hard to use. she couldn't dance ON the mat. everytime she moved, either the song would start all over again, or another song would start. the spots where they have to step to make a song go are very close together due to the mat being so small. the colors on the mat are great and bright. the sound is a tad bit loud, could use a volume switch. i ended up returning it because it was too frustrating for my dd to the point where she no longer wanted it (she's 20 months). even the sound was too loud for her. plus she couldn't stand on the mat to dance without changing the song. if your child doesn't mind dancing NEXT to it, then it's great, but loud. i would say that is very durable, but it's not worth keeping just for that. everything about it was very disappointing. i will still buy wiggles products, just not this one."
1,This could not be from the wiggles,"My two year olds dont even like this toy. They love the wiggles, they do point to the characters and say their names - but to PLAY on it. Not possible. The songs mumble jumble all over each other as the kids move on the matt. Its a very loud speaker and even I cannot take it (Im very liberal w/ loud toys and banging, etc) There is not an ounce of fun in this toy, im very disappointed as most of the other wiggles toys have been great.Dont spend your money on this one. OR keep your receipt handy."
2,Very Frustrating For A Little One,"My 16 month old daughter received this mat as a gift. I have to agree with several of the previous reviewers about this toy. She can't dance ON the mat, she has to be taken OFF of the mat because as she moves about, a new song starts. It is very frustrating for her, and for us to watch her trying so hard to play with the mat. It should have been made differently. I too had to put clear tape over the speaker....MUCH too loud for a little ones ears. Not to mention annoying for parents as the same song starts over, and over, and over.....My advice is buy another Wiggles themed toy for your Wiggles fan!"
1,Wiggles Dance Mat,"I bought this for my 2-1/2-year-old daughter and she likes it, but I wasn't impressed at all. I thought that when you stepped on the mat it played music for you to follow along with kind of like you see in the arcades, or like what Ronald McDonald is doing on his commercial. Well, I was wrong; the mat has 4 circles that play 4 songs each and that's it. You don't actually dance on the mat because if you do, the songs keep starting over. I was very dissapointed; however, the kids liked the idea of dancing. I could have saved my money and just turned on the radio."
3,It is not Greg Singing!!!,"While this toy has a great premise and is fun for my son to play with, everytime he starts playing with it he asks me ""where is Greg Mommy?"". This is because the person singing the songs on the toy is not Greg but someone else. I think that it is important to note that before buying this toy. Now this toy is fun and entertaining for my son, it would have been far better if it was performed by the wiggles. This toy is slightly disappointing because of that."
1,Think before you buy this toy,"We got this toy as a gift for my son and daughter for Christmas. We were so excited because they LOVE the Wiggles. The truth of it is that the toy is boring and you can't dance on the mat because everytime a child steps on a character's picture on the mat, a new song will begin before the previous one is finished. This can become very annoying, very fast for both parent and child. Overall, my son and daughter played with this for about 5 mins. Then decided to move on. It really didn't keep their interest at all. Two thumbs down! You are much better off buying a Wiggles video and having the kids dance to the video....you'll at least get your money's worth that way!"
3,Wrong reviews,"Clearly the reviewers are writing the classic MGM 1939 version of The Wizard of Oz, but the film listed is an earlier version. This film is from 1914 as such it is silent and black & white, and according to IMDB only 38 minutes."
5,Romans,This series of bible commentaries is excellent. I use it constantly along with my Bible for Bible study class. I have been collecting them all .
4,Tradition,"Savate was born in the street during the long centuries of popular fight. It's a mixture of ""chausson marseillais"" and ""savate"", the organisation of this fight was done during the 19 century to become ""boxe franaise"" . E . Quequet is a expert of self defense and his vision is realistic and very interesting for martial artist."
5,Great protection for your lens when out in the field.,"Offers your lens protection from the elements (ie , dust or mist) - very easy to use and much more convenient than the standard lens cap.Took it to Denali for a week long photography trip and it was perfect."
5,very effective tool! (keep the instructions),"i purchased this tool about 4 months ago and had no trouble at all getting super sharp chains on all 3 of my chainsaws. my brother in law took my advice and also bought it, but he had limited success. be sure to read all of the instructions to set up this guide for your specific chain size! this is very important! otherwise you will not have a properly sharpened chain. good luck and happy sawing!"
5,"Amazon, you are supplying all my needs.",The Dremel 1453 chainsaw sharpening attachments are very nice an strong. I am able to sharpen the chainsaw without concern for my fingers being bruised.I would recommend this item to a friend.
5,Dremel Chain Saw Sharpener,The product works as advertised. Keeps my chain sharp with a minimum of effort
4,Basic product that does the job,"there's not much to the package . . . just a few parts. I would have made the chain holder out of metal rather than plastic and I would have provided a second grinding stone. When the first wears down, you'll need to buy an entire new kit. But it reconditions the chain as promised."
3,"It's OK, But I Get Better Results Hand Sharpening","This tool works OK, but not great. I get better results when I use a hand file in a standard file guide. When you file by hand you can feel whether you're getting a consistent cut from tooth to tooth, with this it's tough to tell. Plus, by the time you take out your Dremel & attach the tool, you could have already sharpened your chain by hand. For the price it was worth a try, but I doubt I'll use this again."
3,Save Some Money--Just buy the grinding stone,So I am not sure what all the fuss is about regarding the guide. I don't find it all that useful personally. Basically you need to get your nose down on the chain to make sure you're grinding it correctly anyway so I am just going to eyeball it after my first trial of the entire unit. I recommend buying the individual stones (in my case the 5/32) and forget the kit. Just sayin'
3,Better than nothing ...,"I was hoping for something that would give me convenient, and more precise method of sharpening my saw chains on the saw. This guide is better than free-handing it, but not by much. I guess I'm going to have to break down and buy a real sharpening tool. If you saw a lot of wood, having a properly sharpened chain is just too important to cut corners."
2,"meh, I've seen better...","I used this in the fall to sharpen my pole pruner, kind of disappointed. You could do the same thing without the fancy guard and just buy any Dremel grinding wheel."
2,Ok little tool,"Seemed like a nice tool for my dremel and worked.Highly suggest if you have to sharpen your chain more then once a year to invest in a bench mount sharpener, off the saw sharpener.I can remove, sharpen and reinstall a chain faster and more accurately with my bench mounted machine then with this Dremel attachment.Now I have 4 chains and just change them out. When a few need sharpened I can do it at my leisure with just the chain and get a better end result."
2,Didn't come with right parts.,Came with only two different sharpening bits. Was missing the one I needed for my saw. Not worth the hassle of returning...
2,Bad info,"Based on the other reviews this tool must work well when paired with the correct Dremel tool, but determining which tool it will fit is a challenge. Amazon's website says ""From the manufacturer...Fits Dremel Tool Models 400, 398, 395, 300, 285, 275, 800, 780, 770.""Then just below:""Product DescriptionEasily sharpen the dullest of chains with rotary tool nos. 275, 285, 395, 398 and 595""Then on the actual package it says:""...easily attaches to Dremel models 275, 285, 395, 398 and 780""I don't know what it will fit, but I can tell you it won't attach to my model 770 as advertised on Amazon's site. So now I have to go out and buy a different model Dremel.... I guess Dremel's bad info is not so stupid after all!"
4,Positive,The tool is excellent. I can now sharpen my chainsaw better and faster than using a manual file.
5,Great little sharpener,"I bought this sharpener even though my rotary tool is not a Dremel but a Sears model, the front end looked the same and sure enough, the tool attached with no problem. I've had it for 3 years and use it frequently, it is simple and easy to use and gives excellent results. The sharpening job used to take me a half hour with a hand file and give less than perfect results, it now gets done in 5 or 6 minutes and always keeps the angle correct and makes the chain as sharp as a new one. I'm still using the included stone sharpener but I also bought a diamond-embedded one for future use. I'm surprised by some of the complaints I've read, it is very easy to install and to use, and works great. I wish I'd bought one years earlier and saved myself a lot of hassles sharpening my chains with a file."
2,Keep it Simple,"if you are using a Dremel model 770, Type 1 tool, this kit will not fit in spite of the package details. I found it much easier to buy the Oregon file guide for my saw (Oregon 5/32-Inch Chain Saw Filing Guide 37534). About two minutes ia all it takes to sharpen my saw and there is no fussing with worn grinding stones. Can't imagine there is a simpler, easier way to do this job."
5,Believe what they say about sharp saws,"You know how they always say that sharpening more than makes up for the time it takes? Believe it. I was on the steep side of the learning curve with my Stihl, and when I bought this sharpener- it turned the saw into a beast. Evidently, I had not been sharpening quite right. I've been using the Dremel attachment for about 5 years, after every 2-3 tanks of gas. The saw cuts faster, with less strain on the saw and on ME.Remember to set the depth gauge.If you own a Dremel- buy this thing. Remember eye protection :)"
5,excellent tool,"This is an excellent purchase for anyone who drops their chains off and gets pissed off when they discover how much of the teeth was removed, (shortening the life of the chain). I found I got best results using cool-grind and a ""light touch"", the guide is not necessary."
2,"Dodgy Directions, Read How to Sharpen with this tool elsewhere!!","I should have read Peters review. He is completely right. Using this tool as described in the instructions gives you a chain sharpened well only in one direction. This is great if you want to cut big curves in your logs as only half of your teeth will bite, but chainsaws were designed to cut in straight lines. This tool irritated the crap out me. Fortunately my father, who has far better mechanical reasoning than I, re-discovered ""the fix"" Peter describes in his review and it works fine now.Very surprised at Dremel for not catching the huge error on this one. Their technical writer should be forced to try every tool before advising anybody as to it's use. IMHO."
3,So so.. maybe need depth gauge,I had a badly worn chain and thought i could revive it using this product but no dice. perhaps this would be good for lightly worn chain. it was easy enough to setup but the manual that came with it was a little difficult to follow. i sharpened my chain and it looked good/sharp but still didn't cut through anything. i think the problem i had was the depth of the cut also needed to be calibrated but didn't have any means to grind the depth gauge tooth. good luck using this..
3,The season is incomplete,The packet includes the 6 discs but is missing 3 episodes. It is like there shouls be a disc between 5 and 6. Also does not include the final episode where Ally decides to leave for NYC. Is this a manufacturing mistake?
5,I love these girls!!,"3lw iz tha bomb! There songs are great, they are really nice and they all have a very sweet voice! They are tha bomb!"
2,A below par cd,"I bought this cd because I liked the song ""No More"". This is about the only good song on the whole cd. Number 2 and 3 are alright and the remix of the song ""no more"" is subpar. The raps in this cd by that one girl are terrible. 3LW sounds a lot like Destiny's Child which is a very bad thing. The sample of jay-Z's song Sunshine was horrible in its own right. This is the worst cd I have bought in a while."
2,THEY WERE GOOD UNTIL...,they did cheetah girls. DAT KILLED THEM.atleast for me. and adrienne and kiley never let the other girl sing...wats hr name again??? iunno (c wat i mean). i heard dey kicked her out becaz her catholic beliefs weren't mixin wit da group. i think good for the other girl or she would of been stuck wit da CHEETAH GIRLS UGH!!!!!!
2,A poor album,"This album is ok. It's not worth buying in stores or online. Alot of the beats aren't fit for the songs, and some songs are just not worth listening to. Using the ""Sunshine"" beat is just not smart at all. ALot of rnb artists need to spend quality time on albums than rushing through. These girls need to grow up."
1,i like these young teenagers girl they can sing they heart.,i like they first song nomore baby ima do right i think this is the best song on this cd and these young girls they know that they can sing they heart out and my other song on this cd that i trully like the most of all is playas don't play and also my other song on this cd that i like the most is curious and i would like to see them in person whenever they come to memphis for they tour and i hope that yall young lady read my review that i had just wrote about yall new album and i will be looking for the buy yall second cd whenever yall come out with a second album.
1,Worthless,This is one of the worst CD I have ever purchased.Whats good about it? There is no musical talent here.It has bad lyrics(that they didn't even write and they are too young to be singing about some stuff.Don't waste your money on this.
4,3LW,"Hi, my name is Lindsey. I'm reviewing 3LW.: It was pretty good. It wasen't really fun to listen to, but it does have good songs. Thats why I rated it 4 stars. It's good, but then again not good. I think you should buy it and see for yourself!"
1,peeple need help,"My sister has this CD. I hateit. Worse than everything. Help. if you want good music, listen to Limp Bizkit, Eminem, Aaron Carter, BSB, Creed, etc..."
3,It was alrite,"I liked this album. I found the R&B grooves and some samples from past songs did it just on some of this album. They talk about love, having fun, and boys playing games. Kelyi can't rap, but for her age it was ok at the time."
5,LOVE IT!!!!!!!!,This is hands-down the best CD in my collection. I got it as an unexpected Christmas present over Thanksgiving vacation and was prepared to dislike it. But I wound up loving it! I've gotta listen to it at least once every day! :-D :-)
2,try again,"The girls of 3LW have beautiful voices and harmonize perfectly. As much as I respect them for singing about things that teens can relate to, I can't say I enjoyed the cd. I thought it was kind of boring. None of the songs were that catchy as none of them stick out in my mind right now. Considering that I love R&B and Pop music, this cd was a disappointment."
5,I love these girls!,"Nothing much to say, its just a great album. And I actually like all of the songs on the album. That's very rare for me."
1,boring!!!,"i liked the song ""no more"" so I bought this cd. It was a complete waste of money. The songs all the sound the same and have incredibly retarted lyrics. I don't recommend this cd at all!"
1,How much do I hate thee.....let me count the ways.,"This CD is so bad that I want to limit my words I use to describe this. All I am going to say is that if I had to choose between listening to this CD or being bald, I would invest in hats."
2,"The opener is good, but.......","A cleverly crafted girl group clone, 3LW's little women all have a TLC counterpart: Kiely Williams plays T-Boz, likely the leader of the group, with the sexier image and raspier voice. Adrienne plays the role of Chilli, with the more elegant look and best voice, while Naturi, of course, is to Left Eye, the less-noticeable rapper of the group, whose sections are edited out on radio. A witty attempt at duplicating TLC's success. Though they fail miserably in accomplishing that, ""No More"" is a very hooky, well-produced song. To this day, the best track this group has ever done. But they're one-hit wonders-in harsher words, don't expect anything better than ""No More (Baby I'ma Do Right)"" from these girls."
