3,A decent book,"I am not sure why everyone seems to love this book so much. While I did enjoy the book, I didn't see it as ground breaking or magical. Dylan at times gets really personal with his writing, but also always seems to keep his distance. He's a wonderful song writer without question, but why some people look at him as a god for this I never have understood. In the book he makes a clear point to the reader, that he's more human than savior. This is a fun and interesting book, that contains many of the people that influenced him in his life. The inside view of these people, is probably one of the most engaging aspects of this little story. I am greatful that Dylan wrote this book, but to put it up on a pedistal and call it a classic is far reaching."
2,And the Point Is?,"Anyone looking for deep insights into Bob Dylan and his art will likely be disappointed in this rather skimpy memoir in which he seemingly picks out a handful of aspects of his life and career at random while ignoring everything else. We get a very lengthily chapter on the making of his 1989 album ""Oh Mercy"" which is a solid album, but it seems odd that this relatively obscure work gets so much ink while groundbreaking albums like ""Highway 61 Revisited,"" and ""John Wesley Harding"" go ignored. Also missing is anything about his infamous motorcycle accident or his late 70's conversion to fundamentalist Christianity.Perhaps much of this is to be covered later, after all the full titles of this book is ""Chronicles, Volume One"" but thus far Mr. Dylan's memoirs come across as little more than a brief stream of consciousness attempt to reassert his reputation for being an egnegmatic recluse."
1,"Who is this man, Dylan?","I have been a big Dylan fan for 30 years and now I find from reading his book that he looked on his followers with distain and wished that they would leave him alone. He just wanted to be a family man. Well, he gets his wish with me. If you want to know anything about Dylan, you won't find it in this book. It's just a long litany of name dropping which leaves you without any insight about what Dylan was thinking when he wrote his greatest lyrics...Maybe, he wasn't thinking at all. If he was, he sure doesn't want his fans to know his thoughts and provocations for what he wrote."
1,Where is the Meat?,"I picked this up to maybe get some insight into the songwriter. Instead what is written is trivial rememberences from scattered parts of his life. Stream of consciousness some say. Drivel, I say."
1,Name Dropping at its Best,"The book is a dry hustle. If what you are interestd in is a list of persons the author knew, this is the book for you. He mentions literally hundreds of ""famous"" names: people he either met, heard singing on records, or read books by, and he gives a one or two line description of each. Apart from that, and the message ""I knew what I wanted to do!"" there is little else of substance in the book. True, there is a cleverly-turned phrase or two here and there, but essentially there is nothing of value here. If this book were written by anyone other than Dylan, it would never have been considered for publication."
1,Trees died for this book ?,"Dylan's prose in this book is full of ""hip cat"" babble and no substance. I actually began to laugh everytime he launched into his hip cat speak - which should qualify his memoir as a comedy work. A pitiful piece of work from someone trying to remain relevant.I mean man this read is like a razor blade cuttin' lunch meat at the deli counter of hard life - walkin' down a road with no end or begining and heavy traffic all goin' the same direction. Sleepin' on a couch that is too hard and too short and was made that way just for you. Through my eyes it attacked my soul like fire burning hungry dogs that are tryin' to steal your refrigerator.The book will appeal to Dylan sycophants, but everyone else can save their money."
3,Bobs Diary - Volume 1,yes..its bob. or bobby as his friends call him.its his unmistakeable voice....bringing it all back home.but chronicles vol 1 doesn't have the ring of blood and sweat that i had hoped for. perhaps the vol 2 will.vol 1 comes off more or less as a very well edited diary.bobs daily diary about his life in his world.i dont think bob put much effort into this endevor himself... more like he had the 'director's final cut'.that said: bob is a great journalist and all those millions of pages of daily reflections have finally been put into a highly readable and very enjoyable script.he certainly has had a life worth chronicling
4,written by bob dylan.,there's one part where he uses lots of idomatic expressions all in a row and it's so silly and funny. one time his last name was zimmerman but then he changed it.
4,Subterranean Homesick Review,"Opened up the box and what did we see?In his own write, the words of Bobby Z.Started in to read while we ate our lunches--There was famous names, a-comin in bunches.Folk-singers . . . Hum-dingers . . .American i-cons.Kept on a-readin; they was all there,Playin their git tars, growin their hair.Van Ronk, Stookey, Brownie McGhee,Freddy Neil, Lanois, and, at last, Joanie B.The in-side story ... or some of it."
5,Steady Stream of Consciousnes Book,"I don't know if Bob wrote or recorded this book for later transcription but it flows like stream of consciousness, with evident efforts to punctuate it along the way with heavy-hitting book titles, authors and names. There are times I sensed an apologetic for influences from other artists musically. Of all the books out there on Dylan, and their are many, this one seems to be a meeting place between answering the accusations in other books and Bob Dylan being himself. Hidden under the words are painful admissions if you can find them of dry spells in his life musically and lack of inspiration, tensioned with producing and performing to please others. It is a human side of Bob Dylan if you can read beneath or behind the words. For all the reviewers who were disappointed, and there were not many, we must remember Dylan is a musician/artist and we need to take from such people what they give us. To expect or ask more would be polluting the stream of inspiration."
3,"Hokum, hophead talk","early in the book, Dylan relates a story about being interviewed by publicist and how most of the answers he gives are totally 'hokum hophead-talk'. I can't help but wonder if the rest of the book is also mostly that."
2,The audio by Sean Penn isn't very good...,"I use audio books, and this audio book only comes abridged (YUCK), and is narrated by Sean Penn. I've listened to maybe 50 to 75 audio books over the last couple of years and I haven't heard a narrator as bad as Sean Penn. Thank goodness I did not buy this audiobook."
4,Interesting insight...,"Well written, although it skips a good chunk of his becoming famous years. This guy has either an incredible memory or he kept a journal. His detail is so concise he could probably write a chapter describing his breakfast. Good Stuff."
3,Bob Dylan chronicles: interesting if you love the guy,"I found it hard to read at times but overall it was interesting to read the mind of a genius. If you have heard and read everything bob dylan has recorded, you will get the songs and albums he talks about, and the people he talks about.But if you only know him through certain albums like ""blonde on blonde"" or ""blood on the tracks"" you'll be clueless as to what he is talking about.Like me, I really wish he had talked about more about the blonde on blonde album and who were the inspirations for songs like ""I Want You"" or ""Just Like a Woman."" I loved the description of Joan Baez which only makes you wonder why they didn't tie the knot.So if you are open to reading anything that has to do with music, read this!"
3,Not bad,"Dylan's long awaited memoir isn't so much an autobiography as a collage. This is probably as it should be. Dylan's biography has been written many times and the basic facts of his life are familiar to fans.Dylan writes well enough --- surprisingly so --- and in places, Chronicles Vol. 1 reads like part of a Kerouac or Salinger novel. However, there's nothing to connect the various parts, so it's only fitfully compelling. Dylan jumps around from one subject to another almost at random, and while he offers an interesting insight or a quotable moment from time to time, the material could be better organized.Still, most readers will argue that by its nature, Chronicles should be more or less random, just as so many Dylan songs are (on the surface) stream-of-consciousness and surrealistic. Perhaps. But I found this a little repetitious and difficult to stick with."
5,Dylan who?,"If you don't know who Bob Dylan is then read this book, its Dylan from his soul. It's the true Bob Dylan at his best and a must read by all that love him. He's one of the people that turned on the 60's with his special form of music, music with a story in ever note that leaves his lips. If you don't know Dylan or know him well you will love this book."
2,Chronicles of Narnia,"I was flim flammed by the master huckster. Dylan's music is ingrained in my life, and I had some doubts (see Tarantula). Still I hoped we might get some insight into the making of some great songs. In 'Chronicles', Dylan claims he was always uncomfortable with being a mythic figure in American music, but the truth is revealed here as he obscures, ignores and papers over facts. Like a politician burnishing an image, he sells himself as an all-American folk hero just trying to sing an honest song. Part truth, mostly hokum. Just beneath the surface, one senses driving ambition. And he name drops. A story about once playing guitar for John Wayne might have been funny, but after so many other famous mentions it's tedious. When he finally cranks it up to talk about making an album, we get the creation of 'Oh Mercy'. Not a top ten on my list. Maybe the good albums will be included in Volume Two, but I'll pass on buying the hardback next time."
2,One Problem: It's Boring,"I love early Dylan and I'm especially fond of the 'Bootleg' stuff he's been releasing lately. But this book, like his later records is a real drag. He just drops name after name after name but he doesn't have one interesting story to tell about any of them. Then he devotes two very long chapters to two mediocre mid career albums, New Morning and Oh Mercy. I consider Dylan the greatest lyricist in rock'n'roll history. He's also one of the most important musicians of all time. His guitar playing is greatly underrated but come on! That book needs some spice. If he doesn't want to reveal anything he shouldn't write an autobiography. We already know he loves Woody Guthrie and Robert Johnson."
3,"Rambling, Eclectic, and Not Who I Expected","Chronicles tells the story--or, rather, eclectic parts of the story--of America's greatest poet-songwriter. But readers who, like me, come to the book with a fuzzy understanding of Dylan as the conscience of the 60s generation--a legendary figure standing against war and social injustice--will be disappointed. Dylan makes no bones about running as fast and as hard as he can from that role.Instead, it's the story (eclectic parts of the story) of a man who loves his family and his music and who wants to be left alone. Fair enough. And along the way he shares some nice insights and turns some nice phrases. But for an icon who prided himself on having something to say, I was disappointed he felt he had so little to do."
2,Audio Chronicles Destroyed by a Big Gaffe,"I love Sean Penn as an actor nearly as much as I worship Bob Dylan as, well, Bob Dylan. With a four-hour drive ahead, I load up my CD player or the long haul. In a few minutes, I say, ""Penn's got perfect pitch for this reading. He's got all the nuances and vocal stylings you'd want. UNTIL I hear Sean Penn pronounce Don Juan as Don Jew-in. Not once, but three times. Inexcusable. Makes you wonder if rolling out the CD meant more than assuring its accuracy; someone's sloppy editing ruins this for me."
2,Dylan's worst biographer....himself,"Dear god, what a terrible writer this guy is (and always has been). From the garbage liner notes on Highway 61, to the unreadable Tarantula, to this pile of blathering inanity (Vol. 1? What a jerk. Why not wait until it's *finished* before selling it!) Face it, we're never going to get anything like the truth out of Dylan, and even if we were so lucky, it won't be presented in anything like a coherent manner. Dylan just sits down at a typewriter (or tape recorder, most likely, since this reads like listening to him talk) and proceeds to babble about the 60s (when he's not time-travelling into his married life or name-dropping dozens of people that no one cares about). If he's the ""voice of a generation"" then that generation is approaching senility.Stick to your music, Bob. Preferably 1962-66. Because beyond that, you really don't have a damn thing to say.RstJ"
2,Mostly Drivel,"Rather than provide meaningful details of his life, Dylan provides only disjointed incidents, many of which the reader would consider trivial. The writing style is so filled with claptrap or trite prose, that one comes away feeling that Dylan is being disingenuous, that he doesn't believe what he's writing. I have been listening to an audio version of the book, and find myself muttering rather often, ""Shut up, Dylan!"" because of his penchant for wasting time discussing stupidities, trivialites or overblown ""philosophy"" rather than the details of his life."
2,Fascinating yet poorly organized,"It is impossible to have grown up under the influence of his music and not be interested in what Dylan has to say. Yet somehow I felt that he really missed the opportunity to express himself. I found that he writes his autobiography with metaphors that reflect his songwriting tendencies, e.g. ""There was a cold wind blowing outside..."", and do not advance his narrative. Also, didn't he use an editor? The story meanders here and there without temporal sequence or evident intentionality. Aside from these flaws, I was fascinated by the opportunity to glance into the mind of such an important artist."
2,finally- a cure for insomnia,"What a dissapointment. This book desperately needed editing. Such namedropping yet very few interesting stories about anyone-including himself. As a child of the 60's I felt a need to push on, and keep reading not so much to learn about him but to recall that period in time and he did recreate the Village of the 50's and 60's for me. But the book kept putting me to sleep.I think one point he was trying to make is that he was not a voice or THE voice of an era but merely a songwriter who became popular. He sure convinced me."
3,Quality Autobiography,"I found Chronicles to be a very quality autobiography. With many insightful opinions and facts about his life it is a must read for close followers of Dylan's life. There are times when Dylan sort of rambles on about certain subjects that I was not so interested in, but I feel that is almost necessary in order to see more of Dylan's personality. This is definitly Dylan's most up to date look back at his life. The one downfall I could say is that this doesn't seem to me to be a good first look at Dylan so a person new to learning about Bob Dylan might want to look elsewhere.Stan Chismark"
5,One of the best books on creativity ever,"And, you get a look inside the mind of a creative genius, both his philosophy and a detailed look at the steps taken to reach his goals.""...it dawned on me that I might have to change my inner thought patterns...that I would have to start believing in possibilities that I wouldn't have allowed before, that I had been closing my creativity down to a very narrow, controllable scale...that things had become too familiar and I might have to disorientate myself.""This book is worth reading and keeping."
1,The Worst Book on Runes Ever Written!,"This book is poorly written and highly inaccurate. Don't waste your money. Check out rune books by Edred Thorsson, Ralph Blum, and Nigel Pennick."
4,Well worth exploring,"A bit daunting for those who are just taking their first steps into looking at Middle Eastern affairs. Otherwise, Stephen Green has compiled a excellent review of US documents that adds light to the relationship between Israel and its main ally. Well worth exploring for anyone interested in the background behind the conflicts."
5,Very satisfied,I love this book I let a friend borrow it and I never got it back so here I am buying my 2nd copy. It really opened my mind to the possibilities and resources that I have available. I can't tell you just for example how many times I have asked one of my guides for a good deal for example my sons shoes I was tight on money and I needed a good deal I specifically asked for converse and I went to a local store and they had a pair on sale for $8. You can not beat that! I have done things like that numerous times I am very happy with this book and the knowledge it has brought me. Thank you Sonia
2,More About Angels Than Guides,"This book was entirely about angels and not so much about Guides, which is what I was looking for. I found it to be very basic and maybe helpful to a teenager or novice on such things. Alot of Catholicism is intertwined in the explanation of angels, so maybe a great book for Catholics? It was a nice book, do not get me wrong, but in no way did it contain what I expected, but then again, expectations usually do lead to letdowns and it was a pretty good book. I just chose 2 stars because of the lack of information on Guides as a whole."
4,Helpful introduction to the spirit world,"Ask Your Guides is a wonderful introduction to spirits, especially for a person who is totally unaware of our constant connection to the spirit world. A reader may feel a little overwhelmed at first because the author lists so many, many different types of spirits & energies, so one needs to keep in mind while reading that the important thing is the fact that we are not alone. In my opinion, the best parts in the book are the exercises & suggestions for learning to connect with your own personal guides and helpers."
5,Making Intuition Common Sense,"Hi,As an intuition development trainer, I am always looking for books to support my own work. Sonia's book is clean, clear and common sense. She describes the guides in a way which is easy to relate to (which they are ) and gives good practical tools for connecting with them.I'm all about making intuition common sense, and useful. This is one of my favorites books for that purpose.Dawn Lianna MA[...]"
1,ASk you're angel guides book,I found it to be very boring. Works well to put you to sleep. I only got to read a few pages. And found that I couldn't finish it. Because I was so bored reading this book.
3,SLow Reader,"This book was too long. I love long books, but this had information that was not necessary(sic). Also too graphic; I want to know details, but this book was erotic! Also not necessary"
3,kitty,I was not thrilled with this book the writer was all over the place and I thought gave too much detail in things I really didn't want to know about and too little in things I wanted to know about. I think told by another writer this would be a very good book.
1,Won't induce vomiting.,"Please be aware that this is not real ipecac, but a homeopathic placebo. If you need real drugs to make you vomit, (if you swallow poison, for instance) this will not work."
1,If I could rate a 0 I would.,"This is not Ipecacuanha. It is simply sugar, water, and gelatin. If You want sugar pills, it is cheaper to make them at home. Don't waste your money."
1,Ipecac Does Not Work,These pills do not work at all. They do not help you remove anything from your digestive system. They are a waste of money.
5,A pleasure to use,"It's hard to find a top quality ipecac on the market. Goes down smooth, vomited with pleasure.Highly recommended."
1,Run Ladies!,David Brill's portrayal of his own divorce is why the divorce rate is 50% in America today. He is obviously a very self-centered and selfish man who is trying to trick the reader into believing that he has done everything imaginable to keep his 17 year marriage from ending. Was this book published to use as toilet tissue?
1,David Brill....Martyr Divorcee,David Brill portrays himself as THE MARTYR in an unhappy marriage. I seriously question this author's motives for having this book published. Any man who would abandon his wife (and 2 daughters) after 17 years by leaving a handwritten note needs his head examined!
2,You have got to be kidding me ...,"I came across this book at the local library and was intrigued by it's Walden like premise. The first half of the book, which dealt more with the building and moving to the cabin and talked about his earlier experiences in the woods, was fairly entertaining. The rest of the book was a chore to complete. It grew difficult to listen to this grown man whine and complain about his life: how he lost touch with his wife (it always seemed to be her fault), how work was interfering with his spirit, and how he shares his feelings (constantly) with his circle of friends. The chapters describing his experiences in nature in the second half of the book tended to be pedantic (""I did this. I saw that.""). .""). Overall, I agree with the first reviewer. There are much better books to be read that cover these topics."
3,28 is misleading,"I bought this to hold my son's video games and the paper inserts (to throw away those plastic cases.) It works okay, BUT there are only 11 sleeves to hold the papers (or liner notes). Each page has 2 slots on the back (good for movies with 2 discs, but not for movies or games with one disc. The discs slide so far into the slots, you have to slide them out to read them if they don't match the liner note on the other side. Also, the remainng 6 (to total the advertised 28) are just 6 slots lined up in the front cover. So, it does hold 28, but only 11 notes. Now I am here to try to find a bigger case to hold both notes and discs."
2,Pop --There goes my screen,I had this TV for over 2 years and it served us pretty well for the time (good but not great) then my kids were playing a PS3 game and I heard a crack-like popping noise and walking into the room to see that the screen lost it's color (did not go black). I need to find out how to fix this - if will cost a lot I'll buy another Plasma (but not Zenith). TV's like this should last longer than 2 years. I see this is happening to a lot of Zenith large screen Plasma sets -- so stay away and go with a Panny (Too bad Pioneer stopped making sets).
2,Not worth it,"I've owned this television for a little over two years and it recently experienced the dreaded pop sound accompanied by the black screen. Overall I was never impressed with picture or sound quality as the colors seemed to bleed, even with the best of cables and the sound would distort on anything past mid level. In fact the speakers even started buzzing at higher sound levels as if one of the speakers were blown.I would'nt be so quick to rant if I feel I got my money's worth for the short time I had this tv, but the sad part is I only used this television an average of 1 HOUR A WEEK because I rarely have the time to watch. For it to go out with such infrequent use is just a shame in terms of quality. I've always been a Sony and Panasonic consumer and bought this purely on price (sales and discounts). Big mistake."
1,Mine popped twice - there should be a class action suit,"It's a nice tv when it works. It first popped during theextended warranty period. Now a bit less than three years laterit did the same thing - a loud pop and no picture, but I have sound.There are so many people this is happening to. I just can't believe thereis no recall or class action suit."
1,dontbuyzenith,"I bought this unit about 4 years ago and luckily I bought the 5 year warranty. It is junk(how do you underline junk?). Anyway, It has failed on me 3 times now. First the death pop, and then blue lines on the screen twice. Lets face it, we all bought a lemon. Stick with Panasonic next time or Sony. Thought I could trust a South Korean made product but I will never again."
1,"Run, don't walk, away from this lump.","The z50px2d is made by LG, and the quality is absolute garbage.The details:Purchased a few years back. Within 4 months, the TV popped and would not display an image (only audio) and red sparkles. Searched the net for some help, and found a lot! Went to avsforum.com, and found over 50 pages of complaints on this unit, as well as the workaround to get it replaced. Turns out, there is a known design flaw on the system boards, and they routinely fail (causing the sparkles issue). Attempted to get the unit fixed, and since it was under warranty and could not be fixed within 15 business days, I was issued a full refund. I immediately replaced it with a different brand, and have been much happier with the image, quality, and reliability.If you happen to see one available, whether new or used, pass it by!"
1,POP went the video!,"Mine lasted almost 3 years, which I guess is better than most. The picture and sound was nice while it lasted. I'll call Zenith / LG tomorrow. If they help me I will change my review."
1,I got POP'd Also!,"Mine was purchased at Circuit City exactly 3 1/2 years ago (similar to another person here). Today it made a loud bang from behind the set and was accompanied by an electrical burning smell. The screen faded to almost black. I called a repair center today and based on what happened, the repair guy says it is probably a driver board and will cost anywhere from $300-$600 to fix.Okay, I paid over $3,200 for this set (good price at the time). Basically thus far, this T.V. cost me $76/month to use. IF I pay to repair it, who knows how long it will last until it fails again.Odds are, I will scrap it, do my research for a more reliable brand, buy an extended warranty, and kiss a few hundred dollars goodbye on a smaller LCD set.Thanks Zenith (LG) for [...] my wallet dry."
1,JUNK TV! COMMON ISSUE WITH THIS MODEL ON POP NOISE LEADING TO BROKEN TV.,We are also victims of this faulty TV scenario. Purchased the Zenith Z50PX2D 50 in. HDTV Plasma Television almost 3.5 years ago. Paid over $3000+ was told this type of tv (at Best Buy) has a life 10+ years. Experienced a loud pop 2x (almost equal to the sound of car backfiring) and the picture goes blank. Was told by a tech that it\'s possibly the Y or Z sus. board. This is a common reoccuring prob. with this particular model. These are all faulty parts that NEED TO BE RECALLED! The manufacture should at the VERY least send us replacement parts at no charge and we will pay the labor! Was turned down after numerous calls to customer service.IF THIS TELLS YOU ANYTHING-THERE ARE NUMEROUS COMPLAINTS ON THIS PARTICULAR MODEL ON THE [...] SITE!
1,"""Pop"".........Goes the TV after 9months-2years","Do not waste your money on this Television. Picture was great for the first year and about 15 months out I heard two loud 'Pops."" Had the television repaired and 3 months later same ""pop."" From my understanding there are 5 boards in this television and two of my boards have gone already. I would recommend anyone who is contemplating buying this TV to do your research. Go to yahoo, Google, fixia, best buy, ECT. and you will find that most everyone is hearing a loud ""POP"" after 9months - 2 years of use with the 50"" Zenith Plasma. In the past I had been a huge zenith supporter based on my experience with quality products. I WILL NEVER BUY ANOTHER ZENITH OR LG PRODUCT. I hope that someone else will learn from my big mistake."
4,Pop goes the Weasel cause the Weasel goes pop!,"Acually, I have love this Zenith 50"" plasma, but has I've been readingthis problem has happened quite frequently. The TV is 13 months old, and last night she popped and when out. It somehow knew it was NBA Finals time. I called Zenith first to see if they would do anything; of course that got me no where. Luckally, I purchase the BB 4 year extended warranty. An Electronics company is coming to pick it up next week. We'll see how that goes! ALWAYS BUY THE EXTENDED WARRANTY ON ELECTRONICS!"
1,Getting rid of it!,"Im so glad I read the reviews, its a good thing it hasn't ""popped"" on me yet but Im not going to wait till it does, so bye bye plasma."
1,Popped then died.,"Mine lasted 3 1/2 years before the deadly ""pop"". I tried LG, but they will not help, and the repair would not be worth the cost. This TV is a piece of junk. I will never support LG products of any kind."
1,Another dissatisfied customer....,"After 10 months using this Zenith/LG brand, pop went the picture. No longer usable but fortunately still within the year warranty. Even if they repair this issue, will it occur again within a year and if it does will Zenith/LG stand behind their product. After reviewing other similiar problems from other customers, this is obviously a known issue with this model and I'm surprised at Zenith/LG lack of communicating to their loyal customers who purchased these expensive sets. This is my last purchase with Zenith/LG."
2,Defective,"Bought this tv about 2 1/2 years ago and just a few days ago I got the ""pop"" and black screen. Talked to the Zenith/LG people and they said its out of warranty so can't help.Update - If you have this problem, call 877-543-8325. I spoke with the supervisor and she took down my information and extended the warranty for this one repair. No cost and the repair will be done within one-two weeks."
1,DO NOT BUY ZENITH !!,"Prior to buying the TV we had a 27"" CRT TV that lasted 19 years. So we decided to buy a new TV since it was getting old. So in 1/17/2004 we bought a 40"" Projection TV with a 2 years extended warranty. The TV has been performing great and we have been very happy with it until just last week when we noticed ""blue shadows"" all over the screen.After looking over the manual and adjusting the convergence, no success.To fix this TV outside of its warranty will cost over $1,000 dollars, and with prices on TV's dropping it makes no sense to send it in for repair. It has basically become a disposable TV. We are very disappointed that our TV has only lasted 3 years. I'm sending it to Goodwill.I'm very disappointed that Zenith will not stand behind their products. My only mistake was not researching Zenith TVs prior to buying since I had full faith in the brand.I found other people on the internet with the same exact problem !!I'm sorry to say this was my last Zenith TV."
2,Popped,I had this TV 3 1/2 years. Popped like all the other. Not sure if want to spend $150 to replace y sus board.
1,WHAT A WASTE OF MONEY!!!!!!!!!!,"I, LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE THOUGHT WE WERE GETTING A GREAT DEAL - LG QUALITY AT A LOWER PRICE, HOWEVER WE SHOULD HAVE KNOWN BETTER!!!!! LAST NIGHT OUR TV OF 2YRS WENT POP!! OF COURSE THE WARRANTY HAS EXPIRED - TYPICAL!!! I WISH THAT $2000 WASN'T A BIG DEAL TO US BUT IT IS AND NOW WE'RE LEFT WITH NOTHING TO SHOW FOR IT AND WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO BUY A NEW TV!! DO NOT EVEN GO NEAR THIS BRAND - I WON'T EVER AGAIN!!!"
1,Do Not Buy!,"Just like many of the other reviewers. I purchased my TV January 2006, about a week ago my wife calls me and tells me that the screen is black! I figure maybe one of the connections came loose! I was not so fortunate, i come home from work, take the TV off the wall and plug it straight into the cable box. Same problem! I call Zenith, and the outosurced support tells me that I am out of warranty and to try and power cycle it! I call a little repair shop that I have done business with over the years, and he laughs when I tell him what kind of TV I have. He informs me that Zenith does not have tech support and that they make him pay full price for parts! DO NOT BUY THIS TV! Unfortunately when I bought this TV for $2800, the reviews were great, obviously I should have waited until the first year was up on the product! My fault for only buying the 2 year warranty!"
1,add me to the list of LG & Zenith popping noise,"i have an LG 50"" plasma, got it from Ultimate Electronic in 06, about 2 hrs ago the famous popping noise that every LG & Zenith customer have been waiting for came to me, now no picture or sometime very dark.plan to call them tomorrow ...ill never buy an LG or Zenith again..."
1,You will need a new one every two years!,"Bought the 42"" version in 2003 - completely dead by 2005. I was convinced into ""upgrading"" to a 50"" in Dec. 2005 - Just died yesterday again... completely without warranty, so far my ""early adopter"" status with Zenith has cost me about $8,000 - and I have two funky things to throw out that the trash guy doesn't appreciate. JUNK."
1,Another Pop,"I have had the 50"" Zenith 1yr. 10months. Last night a loud pop and then no picture. Fortunately I bought extended warranty with Best Buy. Bad news, two weeks before they can come out."
1,"tv died after 15 months,popped and toxic fumes",I know we had done consumer report reviews and were excited at the time b/c of the price and LG type plasma at a zenith price.MY D/H had seen these reviews 4 mos. ago and was praying it would not happen to us but it did.THE POP reality happened this am.I will never again buy anything with the zenith name.I thought they stood for quality but no more.Count us in on the class action suit for duping all of us that were surprised by such an inferior product that should have never been on the market in the first place.Cathy Naylor
2,"another ""popper""",I've had this TV 14 months; while my sister was watching it a loud pop and black screen appeared; I have a feeling I'm going to get screwed on this like the other 2 reviewers; the warranty is only a year; I mistakenly had faith in zenith so I didn't buy the extended warranty from CC; I wasn't that happy with it to begin with; the sound is tinny and crackly at times; with a black background there's a lot of varibility in the blacks which is what I think other people are referring to as artefact with a black background; they form these black/grey blotches which is annoying; I don't recommend you purchase this; this is certainly making me question the LG refridgerator and dishwasher that I have bought too; there must be more cases like mine and the other 2 reviewers; zenith/LG's quality control was got to be better
1,I wish I could rate this lower,"I bought the Zenith 50"" plasma 14 months ago and from the looks of it, these TVs don't last more than that. Last night our TV made a huge POPPING noise and that was all she wrote.I now have to battle with Best Buy and convince them to give me another brand or store credit. I bought the warranty for the TV ($399 for 4 years) but I don't want this TV fixed. I want a different brand.I can't believe that their isn't a recall on this item. The internet is full of this popping problem.Wish me luck on getting another brand."
2,Still waiting for that third issue,"I subscribed for one year which was supposed to be three issues. I only got two, but every time they publish a new issue they send me an e-mail letting me know it's available for order."
3,Smurfs,"Certainly worth a look for any Smurffan, or animation buff. Catchy little story line, okay animation, but what do you want from 1983? Although I was upset that Gargamel and Azreial were not in it. Watch it! Why not? It's only 75 mins."
3,VHS,"bit dated format, but my daughter wanted it for her collection - she seemed pleased with it, so I guess it was fine"
3,Not what it seems at first,"While this is a fine book written by a beloved actress, it's not Ellen Corby's autobiography, as the title suggests. Rather, it's an allegory of a traveling pebble. Miss Corby's talent certainly was multifaceted!"
3,"best of a decent act, nothing exciting","I remember DB from the MTV video days - 3 or 4 songs that got airplay over and over again. I got it for that- cheap enough - nothing else is worth much. My favorite is ""Cat People"" because of it's catchy and of it's connection to the movie starring Malcolm McDowell of Clockwork Orange fame and hot Nastasia Kinsky who briefly was Polanski's under aged(?) lover. Anyway, DB's music has not held up well over time - get this for nostalgia of his preening moments from the past - don't expect anything more."
5,Great Reference,This is one text I will keep and refer to often. Outstanding for work on my PhD in Chemical Engineering.
1,authors hijacked an existing title,"The ORIGINAL Skeptic's Annotated Bible at skepticsannotatedbible dot com is a true work of criticism that highlights the cruel, absurd, and inhumane claims and passages in the Bible. To ride on the success of that web publication the San Diego based ""Jesus Christ Saves Ministries"" in essence hijacked the title (and bought the adjacent web domain, skepticsannotatedbible dot org).It's a poor attempt at apologetics.The fact remains: Reading the Bible (or rather one of its innumerable divergent translations/editions) may well turn the reader into an atheist.There is a reason why the Catholics kept the ""holy"" texts untranslated and out of laity's hands for over a millennium.Finally, if you happen to be a Christian, consider how easy you'll find it to dismiss, e.g. the Muslim's apologetics about the treatment of women as unconvincing. Btw, the original Skeptic's Annotated Bible also disect the Quran along with the Book of Mormon."
4,A Good business book!,This turned out to be a very interesting book once I got into it. This book gave you a blow by blow description of the R.J.Reynolds Nabisco buyout deal. You get a very good description of some of the people who were involved in making this deal happen.You get an inside look at some of the companies who were on theground floor if this mega deal.Some of the monetary figures andabove all the commissions that were paid out as a result of thisbnuyout were staggering. This book put the deal on paper where a lay person such as myself can understand it. This is a very goodbook on the subject of buyouts.Read it. You will not be dissapointed.
5,The best thriller I have ever read.,"I read this book in one sitting. It was the best thriller I have ever read. I could barely wait to find out what happened next, even though I knew in advance how the story ended. The problem with this book is that it is not a thriller and it is not a story."
3,Entertaining Board Room Antics,"Its a good book from the perspective of corporate politics. Insightful as to the motivations of the different players. Disappointing from the finance side of things, as there was not enough information about the inner workings of the deals proposed to buy out RJR."
5,Absolutely gripping!!,"I had never even heard of this story and I dont really know anything about finance either. However, like so many of my purchases on this website - Amazon recommended it to me and i took the bait (are they ever wrong??). This book is one of the best thrillers I have ever read - made all the better by the fact that its a true story. You dont need to have any background in finance or even an interest in it - this book is just such a great story. If you think this book isn't for you - trust me it is. Just buy it and thank me later :)"
4,Greed.. the Wall Street motto,"Barbarians at the Gate is one of the best business books I've ever read. It rings true now as it did 20 years ago when the RJR Nabisco LBO took place. The knowledge you acquire from reading the book should be a prerequisite in business, financial and law schools. It should be a constant reminder for us of the impact of greed and money on human behavior. It should also help us be critical of our own actions and how these may affect others, industries and the way business is done. Great read."
5,Excellent Work,"Based on exhaustive research, the authors have done a fantastic job putting it all together."
4,"Barbarians at the gate? Hell, they're already inside!","A good read for a complete novice on the world of Wall Street and corporate America. We benefit from the indepth research of the authors, clearly close to their subject, and, from their good journalism, as they know how to tell a story without losing the layman. My subtitle for the book would be 'all I ever needed to know about LBOs' -- the RJR Nabisco buyout is an excellent case study. There's little too much extraneous detail on the characters -- it's distracting -- but perhaps that's an effort to give them some depth. Indeed, it's a pity that many of the main protagonists are so reprehensible -- I found it hard to empathise with any of the characters. And the story does leave the reader with a sense of disillusion on two points: the sheer waste of money and resources squandered for the sake of egos; and clearly, contacts (especially amongst the 'jocks') are as, if not more, important than diligence, competance or intelligence"
5,fascinating account of the 1980s merger mania,"It reads like a thriller. Once I started reading it, I couldn't put it down. It is the story of the RJR Nabisco buyout through the eyes of two journalists and it shows that a real world story can be just as dramatic as fiction. This book is one of the most important documentaries of the 1980s."
4,The ultimate account but somewhat un-interesting,"A very good book that is extremely thorough. If you want to know how deals were done on Wall St in the 1980s, this book is for you. To a large extent, it is also about the riches of the time -- the air force of RJR, for example. In the end, what we have are people who claw their way to the top not necessarily for money anymore, but to relieve their boredom (Ross Johnson) and to gain more power (Kravis). The book is a little long in the sense that at least 4/5 of it are devoted to the deal process (I think it could have been 100 pages shorter), but still worth it, esp for those intent on getting the details behind the deal. I guess in 1991 that was a little more interesting than it is now. Another good corporate read, although not a book about Wall St deals per se, is The Informant."
3,Over rated,Many people I know have read this book and rave about how good it is. However it is really just a factual account of the events with no real insight. The writing is ok but you are not transformed into the action. You get no since of the pressure or the egos. The characters are the real deal and the writes don't all you to understand them or even get you to like or hate them. The book left me a bit flat but if you have no idea how companies are bought and offers are made it is still worth the read. If you know how companies are bought it is worth the read just to be scared to death.
3,Interesting Details Fly by at Lightning Speed,"This review is specific to the audio book (CD). The history is fascinating. I have always enjoyed these ""behind the scenes"" looks at the inner workings of modern business. The challenge with listening to this type of book is there is so many names and details to keep straight. It is easy to do when reading at your own pace and being able to refer back. But it is much harder with an audio book. This challenge is exacerbated with this audio book because the two readers read the book at a much-to-intense pace. This is one that I wold have rather read then listened to on CD."
5,The business book of business books,"To say this book was expertly written, would be an understatement. The authors craft the perfect description of an LBO, with all the players, transactions, and affects on peples lives. How they were able to get inside as well as they did, is really beyond me. This is one for the ages and should be read in Business schools."
5,Classic,"This may be the most entertaining business book ever written. There are more whiplashing twists in this book than most works of fictional literature. Absolutely fascinating story of the biggest, and most irresponsible pre-internet deal of the century. The LBO was to the eighties what the pre-mature ipo was to the late 90's. Very well written and thorough, this is one of the best books I have ever read on any subject."
5,A great read,"This is a great story. Walsh College, a business school in Michigan, included it as required reading in a finance course I took -- the school is known for having students read some present day classic material -- and it was present day when I read it. It's good, brings to light the greed and excess so common in corporate boardrooms of the 80s --- and into the 90s...and does it so well.It's a great read."
4,LBO nr 1,Great book about the real public to private activities of private equity firms. Nice to see that the investment bankers are again not very reliable partners...
4,Descriptive,"Barbarians provides a detailed look into the biggest LBO in history - RJR Nabisco. The author does any amazing job of describing the events, people, industry and money involved in this transaction. The author paints a perception of what drives men in the LBO industry - ethically and economically. He doesn't try to sway your opinion one way or the other. The chain of events, themselves, makes this book worth reading - no player in this transaction is left untouched. I recommend anyone interested in LBOs to pick and read this book. Tremondous insight into the LBO/power player industry"
2,Not worth it for Dewalt 7700 Radials,"The ""bracket"" is a short piece of aluminum angle with a hole drilled to pass the anti-kickback pawl. The hole is in the right place but appears a hand-drilled piece with erratic edges...i.e. no better than hand-drilling a piece of aluminum angle from Home Depot. More importantly, the bracket does position the laser effectively. This bracket holds the laserkerf laser much too close to the work surface so that the beam does not reach the edge of the blade or extend far enough onto the workpiece.Nice idea but basically a complete waste.If you want to mount the Laserkerf, which seems to be a decent piece of kit, position it by hand a few times to get a feel for where the beam will be cast, then cut your own bracket. It will take 15 minutes but work much better."
3,Mediocre...,"Cheap price but mediocre packaging. The back of the card should have a listing of materials that each different stone works best with: Aluminum, Steel, Cast-iron, etc. As a tip, you can dip the stone you are working with in transmission fluid (any kind will do) every 20-30 seconds to prevent material from building-up on the stone surface and making the stone ineffective."
1,Weird item,This rag is a weird little item proposing a different method of shoeing horses than what was commonly being done at the time (pre-automobile). My impression is that these weirdos were the 1800's version of PETA. Don't waste your time if you are actually interested in learning how to shoe a horse.
3,Enjoyable even with Technical Glitches,"Each of the games reaches a point where, in the words of one of the game's programmers, ""poor coding kicks in."" Rather than go through each of the points in the games where bugs surface, I'll simply suggest potential buyers go to EA Games' website and flip through the 4 pages of the technical support issues with the Harry Potter games on PC. If you still want to buy the set, then beware: at some point, there you or your kid will be, having a ball, and just about to -- [hey, what the..., why did the screen go black?!]. Caveat emptor."
4,A fun game!,I am seven years old and I have just started playing the first game of The World of Harry Potter and the game was a little bit easy to learn but very fun !Cennydd
3,Bah...,"It's true that most thing get better in our memories... HP 1 and 2 sucks a lot, really awfull game. I guess, at the time, not only graphics was acceptable but the now orrible gameplay seemed better since HP's story was new and fresh. Too bad... at least the third HP (p.of azkaban) is a nice game by modern standards, and quidditch world cup is funny in its easy way. Since this pack its not expensive you can go for it... but it would be far better to buy the single nice Hp games (and getting at least the booklet, in this package nonexistent) than take this compilation. Only for VERY hardcore HP fans."
3,prone to memory conflicts with computers,"I have tried two of the four games so far. minimal directions included. In order to get trouble-shooting help, you must go on line. Have not tried help yet. Both programs skip through dialogue too fast (halfway through a sentence, it skips to next scene, so you miss out on information that may be valuable.) Have a fast computer for using it on, not sure why this is happening.Graphics are really good. action is also very good. Challenges are definitely tough at first."
4,Must Have,For Harry Potter Fans a complete pack of the games to date...i loved playing them and can't wait for HP4 game to arrive
5,A Must-Have for Harry Potter Fans!,"If you have never played the Harry Potter video games, then get this bundle for your PC.This collection includes 4 games: Sorcerer's Stone, Chamber of Secrets, Prisoner of Azkaban, and Quidditch.Overall: This is a must-have for Harry Potter fans! 5 out of 5 stars."
4,World of Harry Potter Purchase....,My son thought that the Quidich was a little more difficult than the X-Box version. The movement is a bit slow acording to him. Other than that he really enjoys the set.
3,average strong but be aware of the flavor,"First of all, this is about the flavor so it is very personal. I like strong tea indeed. So I'm trying to find all the strong black tea. I do not want to use a lot of tea bags or leaves to get the strong tea. This product has very week taste but it also very strange black tea flavor. Personally, I will not consider it again."
1,Freemasons?????,"If you are expecting to learn something about the Freemasons, forget ""Freemasons Watcher"". That item has little or nothing to do with the so called secret society. However I would recommend ""Freemasons for Dummies,"" published by Wiley Publishing. Here you will find a wealth of accurate information concerning the history, beliefs, and rituals of Freemasonry that will satisfy your curiosity."
3,Incomplete,"Although ""Southeast Asia: A Concise History"" is scholarly and well written, it is not as informative as many of it's competitors. The author provides a good framework and introduces the reader to key concepts, for example, the difference between Land-based Kingdoms and Maritime Kingdoms.However, the book is centered around Indonesia and other countries are neglected. Brunei is barely mentioned and East Timor was not yet in existence when the book was published in the year 2000.I would recommend ""Southeast Asia in World History,"" by David Chandler instead. But... both together would be great, too."
3,A short history of Southeast Asia.,"This is a shortened history of the region north of Australia and south of China. This is a pivotal area for America with what happened in Vietnam and the Phillippines. The author provides a standard overview of the history of the countries that are in this area, and what influences they have had from the rest of the world. This region has been influenced from China and India, but also from the Middle East and Europe. This influences still predominate today in these 13 countries. Religion, culture, and politics are the focus in this book.I was a little disappointed that the current strife in Indonesia was not covered in this book. East Timor is now a nation, but the author just passes it in mention. Also, the separatist tendencies in both Indonesia, Burma, and the Phillippines are only mentioned. One does not get a complete picture. This is indeed a concise history and provides a lot of information. For more detail, read elsewhere."
3,HOT PURSUIT2 &HIGH STAKES !!!..,"HOT PURSUIT2&HIGH STAKES DO NOT WORK WELL WITH (WHEEL & PEDAL )!!I STILL PLAY UNDERGROUND & PORSCHE UNLEASHED,THEY WORK ALOT BETTER WITH ( WHEEL & PEDAL ).IT TAKES A LOT TO MAKE ME HAPPY,WITH A RACING GAME !! 2 OF 4 NOT TO GOOD !!"
5,incredible,"I Ordered this for my son for his birthday, and unfortunately one of the games he is unable to play, the disc is corrupt, it does not install or play properly!I would love to hear from someone about their replacing this with a new disc that does workThe other games are fine, but in hot pursuit 2 the rear end tends to slide out a lot in your car.We look forward to hearing from you!"
3,reviewing mr. fantastic,i bought this toy for my grandson and he is thrilled with it... my reason for giving it a 3 star review is there are too many pieces and some do not snap into the body....
4,A Very Nice Figure,"If your skeptical of buying this toy, buy it. Even without the attatchments it is worth the money. It is very detailed, has many points of articulation, and the paint is realistic to the movie. The attatchments are a good idea, but the paint comes off of them fairly easily (keep them in a bag). It takes a pretty long time to assemble the figure to full size, and once in full size it does not stand up, it looks very cool and is worth the time. I would buy this figure, collectors and if you want to play with it."
5,Great reading loupe1and a tip,"This is a very nice reading loupe that attaches to my glasses. However, with my frames, it didn't stay in place too well on the side. Here is a tip. Cut a stick-on eye glasses nose pad in half. Place the two halves inside the clip. This will allow the clip to get a better grip on frames plus avoid scratching up the side ear piece part of the frame. Now the loupe does not slip."
1,Falls short for my needs,"I don't see how this thing can clip to any glasses. It would not hold to any pair around my house, including two different prescription pairs of mine; one wire-framed, one plastic, and my wife's drugstore reading glasses. Also, there is very little means for adjustment. Maybe some people will have just the right type of frame, and just the right need for the limited angle and distance this item provides.I found another product for my needs - a near-perfect solution. The Carson OcuLens clip-on eyeglass costs less than $10! See my review."
5,Well made and optically good,"My husband is legally blind and uses these loupes for all the reading that he does. This is the best one we have found. It is somewhat pricey, but it is sturdy and the optics are reliably good. Many other brands do not hold up for long, simply falling apart and/or the optics are inferior. Bausch and Lomb make an excellent product,"
5,great eyeglass loupes,I've been looking for a pair of loupes to attach to my glasses for fine work for a long time and was delighted to find them on Amazon.com. The pair I bought work beautifully. The optics are clear and the magnification was just what I was looking for.
5,Sleepy James LA 'til Morning,"Great compositions, real down home musical skills. The kind that simply doesn't come easy these days. Besides, Sleepy James is a personal friend and fellow comrade in arms, (Ehh,.. GSQ?)"
2,Don't Buy,"We have to use this book for the college class that I'm taking and it is a horrible book. I often find myself looking for help on the internet rather than going to this book. It is poorly organized, I have to go to the index in order to find something I specifically need because the book isn't in any order. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone. Find another there are many more."
2,It's not meant for the beginner,"I just took my first ""C"" class this semester, and when I looked at our textbook written by Foster, at first glance it looked good. However, for the beginner programmer this book is NOT for you! Yes, it comes with a floppy with sample code. It helps with the first 2 or 3 chapters, but after that Foster gets to theoretical and technical in his explanations. His C++ Preview is a joke. For the beginner I suggest books meant for the layman. Especially, ""C by Example"", by Greg Perry Que Publishers, and Greg's other book "" Programming C in 12 Easy Lessons"", Sams Publishing. Of course the "" C for Dummies"" is a big help also. Perry excels at teaching the beginner by making the concepts of functions, passing values and addresses, static variables etc much easier to understand. I own all the books above and like Greg Perry's the best.Good Luck Programmers. "" C"" you laterUliv"
3,Not Bad,"considering the increasing quantity of video games appearing and the reduction in overall quality, this one seems to come accross as an above average graphics, quick gameplay, varied levels with a multitude of creatures. However as emersive as the atmospherice effects and graphic are I have to admit it is at times too graphic. Nevertheless, certainly fun. Nice playability and quite easy to manouver and my oh my those weapons... Wow. In a nut shell I would have liked it as much as doom 3 if it only were for three things: the loading time between levels and the simplicity of gameplay engine and lack of ability to interact with your environment for a more dynamic experience. Also, I always would rather see new versions of the same games rather than those dreaded expansion packs."
2,Poor Clamps,"Great sander as far as vibration and performance, but the paper holding clamps are near worthless. The paper does not stay in place.I will be looking to purchase another sander with hook n loop, and possibly modifying this sander to accept H & L paper."
3,I've owned this sander for 2 years.,"And although it is made in Switzerland, certain parts are poorly designed. I just payed Bosch over $30.00 to send me a new swing plate (aka base plate) and another tension clip, both of which snapped off on separate occassions. There is a little (and I mean little) tab which holds the tension clips in place while you're sanding -the tension clips hold the sandpaper in place. Each tab is a very small thin ""bump"" of aluminum on each side of the base plate, and they can snap off, as one of mine did. I didn't want to buy a new base plate so I had to bend the tension clip in and tuck it under the sander body in order to keep it from working loose during sanding. This put an extra strain on it and it finally broke. So I had to give in and order both parts. If the tabs were stronger and better designed this would not be an issue."
5,Love this sander,Bosch has been the tool of choice for me for some time and this sander is no exception. It's very quite and the dust collector works very well. This will sand a lot of area fast. The shipping was fast and the sander is terrific. I couldn't be happier!
2,Poor Quality Control,"The Bosch 1293D 1/2 sheet sander seems to be made well. It runs relatively quietly and smoothly. BUT. . . on the most important factor--IT FAILS! The sanding plate (on which one attaches the paper) is warped. In other words, it only sands material in the center portion, NOT the edges. Therefore, it does not sand flat!!! Quite a failure when that is the purpose of a 1/2 sheet sander!Bosch Customer Service promised to send me another plate. But her comment was puzzling, ""If that does not work, it must be the material."" I did not pursue her meaning. . . . unless it was, ""If the new one works the same as the first, you are out of luck."" (I don't think so. . .since Amazon.com Customer Service will be sending me a postpaid return label!)"
5,Tightly knit believeable novel...,"Phil Ferriel has created a well written novel that reads like an autobiography it's so believeable. Humor is at the center of the things that work in ""Getting in the Game"" followed by graphically portayed emotions, sexuality and life experiences...Highly recommended outstanding saga of a family of down to earthers who try all their lives to ""get in the game""...and they certainly do... in my book.EXCELLENT!"
5,Best In Show,"This was hilarious. If you enjoyed the move ""Best in Show"" by Christopher Guest, then you will love this actual documentary. There are no actors here, its the real thing."
5,Cute and Funny,My daughter has four ferrets and thoroughly enjoyed this DVD. She liked the shows and the look into the homes of the owners and their ferrets. The parts where they dressed them up was so funny. I'd recommend this DVD to any ferret owner or maybe just anyone who needed a laugh.
1,Disservice to ferrets and ferret owners,"I was incredibly disappointed in the program ""FERRETS: THE PURSUIT OF EXCELLENCE"" shown on my local PBS station last night. As a ferret owner I was appalled by the treatment of the ferrets depicted. Many scenes focused on owners roughly handling their pets by throwing them into the air, using bed sheets to launch them into air, or other negligible acts. While ferrets are hardy, flexible animals they are not toys and should not be treated as such. I feel this program glorified this type of rough and uncalled for treatment of these small loving animals."
4,"Great television, though a little expensive","I first saw this special on PBS several years ago. Watched it with my dog (a west highland terrier) and we both loved it. It's a perfect combination of quirky documentary and laugh out loud comedy. Wish it were 1) longer and 2) not quite as expensive. Shelling out $20 for only about an hour of footage was tough, but definitely worth it."
5,Funny,I had originally purchased this dvd because I recently got a deaf ferret and this movie has a segment on training them which is very helpful. The rest of the dvd was interesting. Although there is a crazy woman who sings a ferret song that made me laugh. I thought I was crazy!
5,the new grown up,The book was informative and a new perspective on modern adults. A must read if you were the kid who never wanted to grow up
2,Intriguing But Flawed,"I found the subject of this book to be intriging and I looked forward to learning more about rejuveniles. The book was thought provoking until I read the chapter on Walt Disney. In my opinion, the author chose to present Walt Disney in an unflattering light and to perpetuate myths, gossip, and inaccuracies. That chapter tainted the book for me."
5,Vandoren ZZ Alto Sax Reeds - Very Good,"The sax reeds was purchased for my student sax upgrade on reeds. The sax reeds works great, I and my student are very pleased with them."
5,Great price!,"Great price and the product looks good, not like it sat on the shelf forever. The reeds have all been good so far!"
3,A lot of lemons,Ive gone through 5 of these and they were so weak they got cracked on first use but the ones that didn't crack were beautiful
5,Great book,It's about time there is a book like this out. This book is right to the point. I know so many people who are brainwashed by Fox and WABC and this book shows how pathetic they are. Great book and cute picture of Vin.
1,A Continuation of Anti-Bush Propaganda,"This guy is just a typical Bush - Bashing whiner, in the same company as Michael Moore, Sean Penn, Bob Woodward, Richard Clarke, etc.His assertions are non sensical, untrue, and downright idiotic."
3,"Considering this was a brand new CD,","there was one track that wouldn't play right, and when I looked at it, it was blemished... I ran it through a scratch remover, and it worked perfectly fine!~ Thanks~ Awesome~"
4,Overall happy with purchase.,"Nice transaction, would buy from again. I bought items in two separate transactions & seller shipped items together but did not discount my shipping. ($7.66 per item)If they aren't going to take it upon themselves to discount shipping for their savings then they should ship separately as they were ordered."
5,MY OH MY!,"Schmidt studied with Bruckner for a few years and played cello under Mahler. His other famous work is ""The Book with Seven Seals"" Oratorio.So many things happen when you listen to these four symphonies and there's no way that you will be dissapointed with this set (which is the only complete set). My only recommendation is to try to find it used because it will kill your wallet to buy it new!"
1,Problem programming channels?,I've had 2 of these televisions in 4 days and neither one will program channels into it except for channels 5 and 6. I'm connected to Comcast analog in the Chicago area. Magnavox tech. support is stumped. I've run the channel scan at least 30 times to no avail. Does anybody know what the problem might be? Is there a way to change the cable mode between irc and hrc?
3,Fast Shipping,"I received the product fast, but the plastic on the frame had a large scratch on it that I had to replace. Rest of product looked great, but sadly frame was not in a shape I could present as a gift :("
3,So so.,"Not one of my favorites. Not too erotic, not too thrilling. The first half of the book is much better than the the rest of it as the plot grows confusing and lost in details and in police investigation's procedures."
2,"Great Start, Bad Finish","This book really had me going when I first started it. It had a lot of twists and turns that I found very interesting. As I got to the end of the book to see how everything ties together, believe me the knots were not secure.It was not realistic in any shape or form.There is no erotica in this book what so ever, so if that is what you are looking for please skip this book and move on to another.I am not going to write this review to tell you about the book, because it is best to form your own opinion, but please take this advise, if you do read, there is going to be alot to be desired."
3,An Okay Debut!,"Darkness Bound, Larry Brooks' first novel, starts off very strong and maintains its strength through the first two-thirds of the book. I'd rate the book ""4 stars"" up to this point. However, the last third only gets a ""2 star"" rating, as it didn't sustain my interest and all I wanted to do was finish the book so I could move on to my next one. The basic problem for me is that Brooks introduced so many plot twists -- most of which I was able to anticipate --that the story became too far-fetched and I found myself not caring about any of the characters. As for the book being promoted as an erotic thriller, the erotism is tepid, at best. Overall, Brooks has a writing style that makes Darkness Bound a fast read, and he definitely does have potential. Hopefully, his next book will be stronger on credible character and plot development."
4,Unexpected Twists,High quality novel from Brooks. Sent you in a whirlwind downward until you finished it. I found myself reading every free moment I had. I'm looking forward to his next book!
3,It was OK,"I liked the book, but it isn't one that I would highly recommend. The story went along at a pretty good pace but there just wasn't enough suspense for me to give it a higher rating."
5,Christmas Story,"A touching Christmas story for all ages. It's a wonderful read-aloud for my grandchildren which lends to discussions of Christmas. The beautiful illustrations also by Patricia Polacco add to the story. A story that captures your heart and gives meaning once again to love, faith, and the true meaning of the Christmas season. This is a definite Christmas favorite."
1,Holocaust,"I bought this book with the intention of curling up with my grandkids and reading them a sweet new Christmas story. I read the book before reading to them and was really relieved that I did. There are references to the holocaust, a number of them quite graphic for a child's ears. While this story might be appropriate for older kids, my grandchildren are 6,8 and 10--far too young to hear about these horrors. I don't understand why other reviews don't mention this.Be aware the holocaust is in the forefront of this story and decide for yourself if man's inhumanity to man is a topic you want to cover in a Christmas book."
3,Great tunes with poor fidelity,"I really like the songs on this CD, however the fidelity on the vocals is very poor and distracts from the richnous of the music. If you like spirit filled songs with a kick this is for you."
4,"good price, prompt dlvy",Book arrived in a very short time from date of order. condition as advertized and price was great.
5,awesome,you get a lot of ylar for your money. So cheap and very nice product. couldn't be happier.. very very nice
4,Tasty,"Very delicious. Taste was 5 stars; ingredients why I dropped one star (added sugar!) but still, I would recommend this product."
1,Worthless!!!,I ordered this to replace my original which I've lost. It is a piece of crap! It doesn't charge my ipod. Even though it said free shipping on the order for Amazon Prime I had to pay the Post Offfice for postage due!
1,DO NOT BUY.. 7 months of normal use - almost burned my mac,Visibly it hasnt fallen apart but the product at the iphone connector has been getting loose to the point that my mac complained that the cable is sucking too much power. Also my car usb power adapter shuts off almost blows its fuse from this cheap trash. Do not buy ! Or be careful if you do... I have to find another replacement and I wasted money on 2 of these crap cables.
1,Bad quality - stopped working after 4 months,"Received it sometimes in March and it brooked in July, open the plug and determine that 2 wires need soldering - the wire were too short to do so, now looking for another better quality cable."
1,Dock Connector,The product broke within two weeks. The end that connects to the iPod came apart right away and I had to be extra careful from day one. WOuld never buy anything from this company again.
2,Only allows charging - WILL NOT WORK FOR TRANSMITTING DATA!,"I have had this since 2008. The cord works fine, even today, but only for charging! I was mislead to believe that it would work for data transfer, it does not! If you just need something for charging your Ipod, go ahead and get this."
1,"Was ok at times, but also short circuited my laptops","I used this for a 3gs and more recently a 4s. This usb worked ok at times. But it did take longer to charge than the usb that came with my product, and most of the time I had to wiggle it around the usb port for it to work.But the biggest problem is that it must overpower your computer, because when I inserted it into all of my USB ports on multiple laptops, it would cause the computer to shutdown. I can't recall if this happened with the 3gs because that was a long time ago, but def with the 4s. I wouldn't recommend this product to anyone."
1,CHEAP,DO NOT buy this product it's so cheap that when I inserted the cable on my ipod the cable broke when I was taking it off. The cable looks so FAKE nothing like an apple product no wonder it's $1.35.
1,very poor quality,"The connector on my cable was tight and very difficult to connect. After the second use, the plastic around the connector pulled off while trying to remove the cable and one of the wires inside broke. I can imagine repeated use of such a tight connector would not be good for the device. Not sure if mine was an exception but I would not recommend this cable.Update: It appears that the tight cable connection damaged our 2nd gen nano. With a known good cable, it now shows that it is charging but it no longer takes a charge. Prior to the incident with this cable, it worked fine."
1,Terrible Quality,"Figured I'd take the chance on these being less stellar and save a buck. A few days later, one of the cords has completely fallen apart. Furthermore, because of the rather imprecise manufacturing it will not fit an iPad docking port (though did fit my iPhone til it broke). Yeah, spend a little more because this is total junk."
5,just as good as original,"AAA+++ just as good as original without the fruit symbol..was told by a friend ""before you purchase anything first checkout Amazon for great deals"" & he was right!"
2,Not exactly what you think,This wasn't what i expected. This is not the original cable that you would get from apple. The speed also seems very slow with this cable.
2,mediocre,"received relatively fast, but didn't appear to be the same connector as in the picture (the sleek original kind), it was a newer, rougher plastic, but works fine..."
1,Terrible,Dock Connector in picture and one sent are different. On top of that it did not sync my computer and my PC. In addition to that the car charger I bought to go with it died out after a week of use. This was absolute terrible service.
3,It works fine but not what I thought..,"I may have misunderstood. But, I thought that I would be able to charge my IPOD via USB when connected to my PC with this particular cable. Unfortunately, that is not the case. Otherwise, it works fine."
5,Product with no problems,"Even though there were some negative reviews, I had no problem with this cable for my 4 gb Ipod player."
3,Nice Product - Poor Delivery Service,"I ordered the product on June 13th, hoping to get it delivered to me by June 24th so I could use my Ipod on a plane trip. It was supposed to only take up to 7 days for delivery. Well, needless to say I didn't receive it when expected so I could not use my Ipod. The delivery finally came on July 2nd. I would check online daily to see the delivery status and it was never updated until June 23rd, 10 days later. I contacted Amazon and they informed me that since I actually was purchasing the product through Clear Av that I needed to contact them. I tried several times to contact them, but was never able to.I have had good service with Amazon.com, so this review is not negative towards them. But, if purchasing a product from Clear Av, I would be cautious if you need to get it promtly."
1,DONT BUY,"IT DOESNT WORK! i ordered the cable once, never got it, ordered it again; got it, but it didnt work at all. sent a complaint in, and they sent the same type of cable and it still didnt work."
1,you get what u pay!,product is not made by apple! Once i plug it to my iphone and if i try to use it the phone just does watever it wants to until i unplug from the charger! but i aint mad cause it aint like i spent 30 dollars for it! i should have known the price was to good to be true!
1,Cheap,"You get what you paid for - a very cheap cable. It worked fine a first but now I have to connect and reconnect by ipod and iphone before my computer can see the device. If I pick up or move it, it gets disconnected. Save yourself some time and go ahead and spend the money and buy a better cable. If you buy this cable you will end up buying a better cable anyway."
2,not what was promised,"This connector is sold as if it's at least equivalent to the Apple original equipment. However, if I use the phone when it's plugged in, it behaves oddly, doesn't respond appropriately, sometimes won't perform at all. The connector does recharge the phone, but it certainly doesn't have full functionality."
1,Where is it?,"Sorry but never received the cable and neither received a response to my email from the sender. so for $1.86 item, just was not worth the extra effort to get a response from the supplier."
5,Good,"The product was fine in all means but I ordered 4 chargers, I received only three even when I paid in full"
1,"horrible, horrible, horrible","This product says it is designed for the iphone and ipod. It is a very poor knock off. I bought two. One does not work at all, the other very poorly, if at all. Does not work with my iPhone, ipod, nor any of my kids apple devices. DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM!!!"
3,"It will work, but poor quality","Yes, this plug will work fine for charging the iphone. I bought three of them and all of them work. But they are definitely not great quality cables. The wires are flimsy, and the plastic connector feels like it will break with much use. Still, for a buck, it seemed a decent option."
1,EXTREMELY poor quality,The USB connector cover pulls right off with minimal effort. It makes it very difficult to unplug the USB from the computer once connected. Do not buy.
4,Works great,"Not sure why some of the other reviewers are so negative. My cord looks exactly like the photo. It connects to my PC, my MAC, and my car. Great item for the cost."
1,"Cable Defective, Worked Intermittently","Cable Defective, Worked Intermittently. So, I threw it away. I gave the company a bad evaluation, and they credited me back. So, I guess that's something."
3,hard to use.....,it does work... but hardly...the part that connects to iphone doesn't sit there quite well.. gets loose and phone wont charge..i will go buy oem regardless of price.
4,Ipod Connect Cable.,The cable works perfectly with my Ipod Classic. I am glad I got it for the price that I paid for the two that I ordered.
1,crap,just received it in the mail and was so happy and when i openened it it was a cheap generic piece of crap. its the retractable ones and they sure are a pain in the butt. dont buy this junk!
5,Almost exactly like the original,"There seem to be a lot of buying choices for this item; some are reasonable and others are outrageous ripoffs, so be careful. I got my cable for $3 shipped with Prime. Without close inspection, it looks identical to the original Apple cable. It seems to work just as well."
2,Not OEM,The end that connects to your iPhone is not standard size or shape. If you are using a case this will not go through it and will not connect to your phone. It will connect only if you don't use a case.
1,Not OEM as advertised,"This connector will not fit the I phone with a protective case on it like the OEM connectors do...is not what I expected, as pictured, it is not an apple product. I have ordered this item from Amazon before and got the correct one."
3,Quantity over quality,Heard from a friend of mine that these affect the Iphone's battery (discharges faster). I must say that I haven't experienced that myself. Probably because I use them more for auxiliary power. If you too want multiple cables around the house/work place I would recommend these. For sporadic use.
3,"Not OEM, works for transfers but poorer quality","Picked up two of these since they're 1/10th the price of the OEM Apple cables. They work fine to transfer data between the computer and to charge the phone, but they're certainly not of the OEM level quality. That's acceptable, but prevents them from earning the full five stars. The most worrisome point is within the first couple uses the area between the connector and the wire has split, exposing the wires inside. This presents no hazard, but has the potential to be damaged more easily and render the entire cable unusable.Overall, they're an acceptable compromise to the overpriced OEM cable."
2,Poor fit,"They work, but the fit is poor enough that I'm afraid I'll damage my phone trying to push them in. I've thrown them out and will try someone else's."
5,worked just like my other one,Bought it to use it on my USB port in my car to charge my iPod Touch. Mine came with one and I use it for home and it makes it better for me then to unplug and take it to the car and back. Plus it was a great price then @ B***b**.
1,Month then flop,After a month to the date of purchase the USB stopped working. Maybe it's just the quality of the product. The service from the seller however was EXCEPTIONAL!!! With very FAST shipping/delivery. I will definitely look for other products from this seller but may look to buy a new USB through a retailer for longer warranty!!
2,"Loose connection, doesn't seem to charge iPad","The connector doesn't sit flush with the devices that I've tried it with (iPhone 4, iPod Nano 6G, iPad 1G). Connector still uses push-to-disconnect dock connector, and only one of the pins seems to lock in to the device. Sometimes will come loose enough to disconnect device from computer/wall charger.Also didn't seem to be very compatible with 10W iPad charger. Took longer than normal to bring iPad to full charge from 70%."
1,DOES NOT WORK!,"It's not a bargain when the product does not work. Got this together with the wall adapter, will not charge my iPhone 3GS. Not hopeful about getting my money back from Hong Kong..."
1,Piece of Junk,"The photo for the product is the Apple connector cable, but that is not what shipped. What I received was so flimsy and cheap, it fell apart on first use. I connected the cable to my phone, and when I tried to disconnect, half of the connector remained in my phone, completely broken from the rest of the cable. This is an absolute piece of junk, and I'm returning it for a refund."
1,Is not even worth $1,"Take 10 time more time to charge the phone, does not connect well to the phone and to the plug. My suggestion, refrain from buying it."
1,TOTAL CRAP,WORKED FOR 3 DAYS THEN JUST QUIT ON ME. GOT A NEW CORD FROM AT&T STORE AND USED WITH SAME POWER PLUG ADAPTER WORKS FINE.
1,"Destroyed not one, but two IPods!","Like described below, this cord is incredible cheap. Upon using it to connect my iPod to my computer I had nothing but problems! It wouldn't load songs, constantly caused errors and my system to slow WAY down!Not thinking it was the cord I diagnosed every other issue. In my frustration I asked a co-worker (I work at an information processing company, my co-worker was my system functional expert). She used her cord to connect my iPod and it worked fine. Thinking I was crazy she used my cord on her device and it entirely messed it up as well!We both had to restore our iPods losing all our music! The item listed is definately not what you get, it looks nothing like the pictures and is definately a cheap useless version of the 'real thing'."
1,Do Not Buy!!,"Instead of charging my iPod, it sucked all the juice out of it. Should have bought the Apple version in the first place."
5,Works with old and new,"I lost my Ipod wire and of course there is plenty of generics on the market for dirt cheap but every single one of them has reviewers who say they regret the fact they went cheap. This is the real deal. Its the newest wire for iphones and classic.. But it works on my ipod video. No problems no errors.. if you have to do something typically better to just do it right then attempt to save a few bucks and waste it on faulty products+shipping not to mention the grief, when you can just do it right the 1st time."
1,Does Not Work Properly,"BEWARE! This is a cheap rip-off of the genuine Apple USB 2.0 cable. It does not work most of the time. When you try to sync your iPod, it will stop part way giving you a warning that there's something ""wrong"" with your device. I replaced this with a real $19.00 Apple cable and it worked beautifully. So lesson learned: if the price is too good to be true, then it's a defective device!"
1,The delivery was very slow,"I thought that I reached in 2 or 3 weeks after having ordered the commodity. However, the expectation was greatly failed to live up to."
1,VERY DISSATIFIED,I was very excited to find a dock connector by APPLE at amazon.com but when I received my order it was not what I had order. I got a dock connector made by some imitation company for ipod. It was not made by APPLE like it was described by the seller. Very unhappy with the seller for being dishonest with the buyer. I would give the seller and the product NO start but you got to click at least a start
1,Does not work,Wanna pay $2 for a cord that doesn't work? Go ahead and do like I did. The thing is a peice of poop.
3,cable,"the first cable i recieved didn't work with my 4th generation ipod, so i contacted the seller. they sent me another one immediately. The new cable works with a mini ipod, at times it doesn't work but it's fine."
3,"You get what you pay for, period!","as the subject line says you get what you pay for. However, I would prefer spending a dollar every six months to buy this versus going to radioshack and spend 20 dollars on a little better quality."
5,VERY GOOD,Vit very good and it is in very good quality and very good shape and the package's is very good
4,works perfect,came fast and it was just what I wanted. Item as described in ad. no problems with the order would recommend
1,Stopped working after a couple week,"I thought this was a great deal, but the cord completely stopped working after a couple weeks. I am very disappointed."
5,Excellent price,"Less than a dollar and it works. I guess quality isn't any better, worse, or different than any other cord. Hard to beat $1 with free shipping."
2,Works alright,I bought these because they were cheap but they are not licensed by apple and don't connect as well as the apple usb cable.
3,cheap knock off!,"this item is not as described, the cord is short (maybe 2 feet) it is a cheap knock-off; however customer service seemed to be very professional.. I was HIGHLY frustrated and i made that known in the message i sent them.. they replied within a proper time period and they are giving me my money back which is the ONLY reason they got 3 stars!"
3,works well,"It works well but only thing concerns me is that it does not have apple brand on it as the original one so I am not sure if its fake or not, but it works well I dont have any problems with that."
3,Awful but worth the price,"This cable has the potential to fall apart literally the first time you use it, but it's nothing a little glue can't fix. Much better alternative to buying Apple's overpriced cables. Just be aware that you're getting a very low quality product."
1,Waste of Time and Money,"Do not waste your time, money or sanity on this cheap knock-off counterfeit cable. It's not a real Apple OEM one and it works sparingly, if at all. The connector worked on and off, with disconnects every ten minutes or so, for the past few months. Now it doesn't work at all!STAY AWAY and buy yourself a real cable from Apple."
3,Not that Great Quality as I thought,"Thought it was going to be a almost same quality as apple, but it wasnt. Ill use it as a back up cable"
1,Awful,"As others stated, while the picture shows an iPod connector manufactured by Apple, you are sent a third party cable which doesn't even allow me to connect my iPod to my computer. Also, the tracker never worked."
1,JUNK,FAST SHIPPING BUT A PIECE OF CRAP....WILL ONLY WORK IF CORD IS IN CERTIN POSITION....NOT WORTH SENDING BACK BECUSE OF PRICE......YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR!!!
4,No problems,Alot of people have complained that they didn't recieve an authentic Apple item. I did and I also payed the lowest price. I am very happy with my purchase from The OEM Shop
2,Disposable quality,While the item(s) do work they do not last. Considering the price point they are disposable items that will need to be replaced frequently.
2,Waste..,This product was good for the first couple of days but by the end of the week the product was torn apart....waste of money....as of today I'm not using this product any longer....:(
2,Didn't work but got prompt refund,"This cord did not work. When I tried to connect the iPod to the computer with this cord, the computer did not recognize the iPod as plugged in (nothing happened).That being said, the seller gave me a refund very promptly without my even having to return the item."
5,Cheap and good as the originial,"For under two bucks, this iPod USB cable is worth every penny. Sure, it may not be made by Apple, but it sure gets the job done. The only problem I have with it is that you sometimes have to force it out of your iPod but that is only a small problem. All in all, this product is absolutely amazing for the price."
3,Avaerage,"A little difficult to actually connect to my Ipod, but in the end, it gets the job done. It was also very inexpensive."
1,Absolute garbage!,"If there was an option to leave zero stars, I would have chosen it. This is a terrible product that will most likely ruin your iPhone or whatever Apple product you connect it to. This is NOT an Apple product: it is a cheap imitation. It would not stay connected nor would it transfer data. My phone is now acting strangely. DO NOT BUY THIS!! The price is cheap because it IS cheap. Go purchase something sold from Apple, not this imitator."
2,Not an official Apple product.,This iPod dock connector is clearly advertised as an Apple product but it is not official. I had to really struggle to get the cable out of my iPod and will not use it again. Small side prongs are very sharp & not smooth like original Apple cable. Should not be advertised as Apple product. Two stars for quick shipping from eTech.
1,FAKE,"The down side to buying products online,While shown is a real apple connector, what is sent to you is a third party, fake connector that does not work very well with an ipod. The battery life is extremely low. Waste of your money"
4,"Hey, It Works","This is not the original USB connection that came with my IPhone 4 when I bought it. It does not have the little 'push buttons' on the side off the connection that you have to push before you can remove it. Also the connection is about half the size of the original one. It fits a little snug, and I kinda have to pull to get it out but hey, it works and it arrived fast."
1,OEM PRODUCTS,I purchased this item from OEM. The item was faulty and did not work. I left negative feedback regarding the item. Was told I would get a credit and a replacement. So far I have received THREE emails from OEM requesting that I remove the negative feedback BUT have not received the replacement.STAY AWAY FROM OEM PRODUCTS!!!!
1,Cheap knock off cable,"Not surprisingly these cables are cheap knock offs.They did not work connecting an iPhone 4 to a 27"" iMac. The moment you plug in the phone you get an OS X error message about a USB device drawing too much power and that port is shut down. I have never seen that message before.However the cable does work with an power adaptor to charge the phone either from the mains adaptor, or a car adaptor. Being as this was my intended use these cables work fine for me and I'll keep the two I bought.Not a replacement for the $20 Apple cable though."
4,"Works well, not orginal Apple but works as good","Made in China is written prominently on the package, but when you look at the product you can barely say it is not authentic. It works well, charges the Iphone 3G as claimed by the vendor.For this price, it is a good deal"
2,You get what you pay for,"They do work, but the connectors fall apart and break with just normal use. I'm not complaining. I paid a fraction compared to an actual apple one, but know that this is not an official iPhone/iPod/iPad cable."
1,Excellent customer service but product didn't work,"The review asks me to rate the product, so I have to give it low marks, but I give the company's customer service 5 stars. I ordered two dock connectors, and neither would sync my iPhone to my laptop. I notified the company and they immediately sent replacements, neither of which would work either. Because so little money was involved, my time was worth more than pursuit of a solution, so I told the company I would not ask for further service.I had dealt with this company before and gave them five stars then. I continue to give them five stars for their customer service..."
2,Will not charge your device,"I don't normally write reviews but I felt compelled after buying three of these from the seller.The cord will connect to your computer but will not charge it.I have spent roughly the same amount on other cables that did charge.If you're in the market for a cheap iPhone cable, keep looking, try to find one that will charge and sync...."
1,I Pod cable,Absolute junk. Fell apart when I squeezed the connector piece to remove it after I charged it. I didn't think it was worth the price to contact seller and go through the work of returning it. You do get what you pay for though.
1,AWFUL,"THIS ITEM IS TERRIBLE, AND WORKS POORLY! IT OVER HEATED MY DAUGHTERS IPOD AND NOT IT DOESNT EVEN WORK, I PAID OVER $200 FOR THE IPOD AND NOW IT DOESNT EVEN WORK. DO NOT BUY!!!!!! DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!!"
2,"Got the Job done, but is a Suspect","Reading the reviews and keeping in mind the price, I was a bit skeptic at first to buy this, but was willing to give it a try regardless. After I bought this product, I only had one defect that I did not appreciate. The Product did not provide an easy docking port for the ipod. It was a small hassle to try and connect the Ipod with the cord. The cord did successfully connect the Ipod to the computer. A month later, my Ipod died on me. I'm not sure if it was because of the age, or because of this new cord, but one minute it was working and the next it was gone. This cord is a suspect and I do not recommend it unless you want to take the risk. After paying the 1 cent and the $2 dollar shipping charge, it isn't worth the risk at all."
1,Dangerous product,The connection from the cable to the ipod is so poorly manufactured that it it will not release. I had to fight to get it out worrying that I was damaging my ipod. I threw it away. Don't buy this product.
2,You get what you pay for.,"I'm one that is not afraid to pay for good quality things, but I decided to go ahead and give this company a try on a product which is sold sold by apple and felt was a little costly.Although I saved a couple of bucks I didn't save on getting a great product. After a couple of weeks the cord began to have problems connecting with my iPod and my AC adaptor. After a couple more weeks I found myself having to wiggle and jiggle the cord in order for it to connect and then the cord just stop working completely. This is one that is definately NOT worth the money."
2,Not as good as Apple's,"It connects fine and it recharges the ipod but it takes forever to charge, not nearly as fast as the Apple one. If you're like me and you only charge it through your computer you'll have to be aware that it takes longer to charge."
1,Cable - DOA,Company Shipped prodict and was good to do business with. Cable was Dead on Arival (DOA).
1,Do Not Buy From GadgetDweeb,"Dock connector was NOT an Apple product as shown, but cheap knockoffs. This seller is purposely deceitful. Do not buy from them."
1,misleaded..,"When I was buying the product, it was displayed as Apple Inc. but when i got it i was surprised that it was a counterfeit. Donot purchase from this buyer."
2,Item Description wasn't right,"the picture of the item is an actual Apple Ipod cable the one i received was not, It was an after market cable.It worked for a 1st gen Ipod Touch but was not compatibale for the 2nd Gen. Better luck next time i guess."
1,Don't buy it,"Thic cable is not the same like this on the picture. It's not maden by apple, it's even not similar in shape."
1,Bait-And-Switch,"The page shows a picture of a standard Apple iPod/iPhone cable, but what you actually receive is a cheap generic cable that doesn't work properly with iTunes and eventually stops working at all with iTunes."
1,not a adveretised,"this item appears to be an Apple product, but it is not. I emailed the seller 4 times before they finally emailed me back a month later. Terrible customer service. Will not buy from this seller again."
1,Doesn't Work,The product worked about 10% of the time. I tried it on various computers and the results were the same. It seems that I should have purchased the actual Apple brand connector.
1,Waste of money,None of these fit an iPhone four and they are certainly not apple certified. All three that I purchased were defective and stopped working after about a week.
1,Complete Waste of Money,"The item was broken in the container when we opened it, it wasn't even worth my time to send it in for a replacement. For as long as the order took it was a complete was of my time, I'm very frustrated."
3,80 percent compatible,"Apple sync cable did not work 100% with my Pioneer radio in my vehicle. Audio connected but shows ""Charging not supported for this device"". Works great with PC sync so that is what I using for. For the price is worth the money."
3,It was alright,"This cord would charge my phone but it is really slow at charging. When it's plugged in, it would show that it's being plugged in but wouldn't necessarily charge like how you would expect. My car charger charges faster than this device, that's why I'm giving this three stars."
1,"Cheap price, cheap quality","This item was very poorly made. One of the small hooks on the iPod connector side was missing, so it won't stay plugged in log. After I used it a few times, the plastic cover on the plug pulled off."
1,Dock Connector to USB 2.0 Cable for iPod and iPhone (White),doesn't work. Waste of time and money. I can't put any music on my Ipod using this cable. Don't buy this cable.
4,iPhone/iPod plug,The plug seems to work fine with my original iPhone adapter. Seems a lot longer to fully charge but overall gets the job done.
2,Short lifespan,"I bought this cable a little less than a year ago. During this period, it worked great - it played my music in my car and charged my iPod. I really like the snap-in feature to keep it from being detached from the iPod. I keep in in my car to connect to my stereo. Last week the cable just stopped working. I didn't bend it excessively and checked the cable for stress marks. I'm guessing that the heat of my car finally got to it. I'm disappointed in the lifespan of this product and will not be purchasing it again. Save your money and buy the AmazonBasics cable - the reviews for it are MUCH better and it will be worth your money in the long run."
4,Dock Connector to USB 2.0 Cable for iPod and iPhone (White),i really like that it came new and that its was shipped very quick it works great and fits percet... thank you
5,AMAZING AND REAL APPLE IPOD USB,shipped exactly when it saidhad safe wrappingand works very wellits made by applegot mines from oem shop!
1,Does not work!,"Bought two of these and neither work - will not charge or transfer data - not on my iPhone 3GS, not on my ipad2, not connected to a PC USB, not connected to a wall outlet adapter. Obviously not worth the the time, expense and trouble to return (return shipping would probably exceed what I paid for them), I guess I'll just tie them together and form a noose so I can imagine the sellers head inside it :)"
1,Does not work - don't buy it,"This does not work at all. It is a bad cable. Unfortunately, you must pay more to get one that works. :-("
1,Charging only (will not sync),"Be forewarned, this cable will NOT sync your iPhone/iPod as described. It will charge, but that's it. I wish I had read the reviews more carefully b/c I really didn't need a charge-only cable. UGH"
1,Not a real apple cable,This isn't a real apple cable. Expect it to stop working in the future because the phones detect poor quality cables. You get what you pay for.
1,bad cable,did not work within a few days ....i think we should stick to apple for getting apple accesories instead of wasting money in cheap cables ...would not buy similar product again
1,Very slow charging and sometimes doesn't charge...,"These charger cables are bad, bought 2, both have some issues. One would intermittently charge. And both would charge very slowly... Really not worth the $ you spend... Spend an extra buck or two and get a better quality cable... Also the cable does not look like what is shown on the picture, the picture is an Apple charger, this one is definitely aftermarket..."
1,Charger didn't work at all,Please do not buy these cheap chargers as they don't work at all...Its a rip off even though the price is less and the catch is that you will not send it back as it would cost more than what you paid for the charger. Bottom line it is Best is to buy the original one from Apple Store...
5,Great Cable for the Ipod.,"yes the cable works and does'nt seem to be cheaply made like some others have mentioned. if your looking for a device to connect to your mac computer if you did'nt get one or you need to replace your cable for the ipod nano then this for you. i bought this one with a Apple USB Power Adapter for iPod/iPhone because just wanted something to charge my ipod because it kept on running of power and i was'nt near my imac to charge it, so i got this combo and it's great, because theApple USB Power Adapter for iPod/iPhone plugs into the wall and then uses the cable to plug into ipod. the only thing that is alittle pesty is that the cable once locked into place on you ipod is like pitbull it won't pull out like a regular one. so you have to push in on the little buttons on the two sides of cable to release the cable from the ipod dock after charging. but other than that it's wonderful."
5,Doct Connector,Wow what a Deal! Excellent Price! I was shocked it was so inexpensive. I did shopping for this product and would have been stuck paying for 2 products instead of one.I am extremely happy I ordered this. It came immediately and I saved so much money. This distributor is excellent!
3,It works & it does not work,"I bought the cable for my work computer and when the cable arrived I tried it on my home computer. Total failure, cycled through connecting and disconnecting continuously so I was disappointed. I planned to return the cable but I decided to take it to work and see if I had the same results there. Actually I had better results, it worked like the original Apple Cable. Both computers are Dell, both are running Windows XP but the home computer is several years old while my work computer is almost two years old. I am not gonna waste time trying to find out the exact reason why it works on one computer over another, I am happy that it works on the computer I bought it for."
5,Cable worked fine for me,the cable worked great don't really see the difference between the original. Order came fast.
3,Product fine delivery rediculous.,"The price of the cord was very good, so I ordered it. The product is fine. The only thing is the price did not offset the time I waited for delivery. It was shipped from California on August 15th... There was no tracking other than to continually say it has been shipped. It arrived in Massachusetts on September 3rd!!! I mean a bicycle can get across the country in 2 and half weeks!"
1,you get what you pay for,"I purchased this item August 19th. The charge did not take long from my laptop, the problem I had was when disconnecting, it pulled apart at the connector at the base of the iphone. Needless to say I had to throw the item away because I could not fix it unless I used superglue."
3,Its Just How it looks in the PICs,"The Charger is SO UGLY!!! And BIg! Its really easy it slip out.. But atleast its something.. Its brand new and came in 4 days... It might not look good, But at least it WORKS!"
5,Perfect replacement cable.,This is an exact duplicate of the connector that is shipped with any new iPod/iPhone/iPad. These connectors work perfectly and are cheap enough that I personally bought 5 of them to replace the old frayed cables from my older iPods. These are the newer model cables with the shortened male connector.
3,Not an apple cord,Product was fine but was not an apple cord. Please be advised that this is NOT APPLE!!!!!! Works fine and for the price it is a good buy.
3,Okay,"The product is a white iPhone/iPod/ whatever cord, but I really do not think it is mac made. It is definitely more bulky than the picture shown for it. I think it's some off brand. But it's does what its supposed to do which is what matters."
1,Shoddy Quality (NOT OEM),These are NOT OEM cables as would be suggested by the title of the store. Two of the cables I bought would not even connect to the iPod to charge. Stay away from these and buy the real thing from a reputable manufacturer.
2,BUYER BEWARE!,I ORDERED TWO IPOD CORDS TO CONNECT MY IPOD TO MY COMPUTER FOR FILE SHARING. ONE WAS IN POOR CONDITION- IT WAS HARD TO PLUG INTO MY IPOD AND THE PLASTIC HOUSING CAME OFF THE WIRES WHEN I TRIED TO DISCONNECT IT THE VERY 1ST TIME I USED IT.THE OTHER CORD WAS IN BETTER CONDITION- NO PROBLEMS WITH IT (YET).
3,Concerned!,The item shipped to me was not quite the same as the other cables I have (one ordered from Amazon). It does not fit quite right. It fits quite snug on the iPhone. I am concerned it might damaged the phone or the cable.
1,Stopped working,"After a month or so of use the cable is no longer recognized by any computer. I tried it at work, at home, mac and PC. The quality isn't worth even this low price."
1,"Picture Deceiving, not Apple Product","The cable they sent is a cheap generic cable that doesn't work properly. The image I looked at had the Apple logo on it, but he cable is not. This product page is utterly misleading and should be modified to correctly describe the product this company is selling (i.e. a non-Apple, third party cable)"
1,Terrible quality and doesn't work,"This product is an utter waste of time, money, and resources. I bought two, having used lots of generic cables in the past without any significant problem. But I've never seen a cable as cheaply made as this. You can see it in the materials and the manufacturing quality.The iPhone connector wouldn't mate properly with my iPhone. There seems to be some irregularity that prevents the connector from inserting properly. For a few minutes I tried gingerly to wiggle it and get it to fit, but it was kind of grinding and I decided that it wasn't worth the risk of damaging the delicate connections on my phone.I'm not going to even bother trying the other cable. After experiencing the poor quality I don't want to risk damage to my phone.The only remaining question is whether I will take the time to return them to Amazon or just dump them in the trash."
1,"Absolute crap, DO NOT BUY this cheap knockoff","Didn't work from the moment it arrived. Spend the money and buy the true Apple version. I should have noticed by the way ""Computor"" was misspelled on the box. On the up side, it did arrive in very timely manner."
5,Identical to advertised picture,"I ordered this product as a small Christmas gift for my husband to replace his current cable that has seen better days and I have to say I am very pleased with the product I received. While waiting for it to arrive today, I looked around at the reviews and got very nervous about what I'd ordered, but the nervousness was all for not. I just opened the packaging and low and behold, I got exactly what was pictured! Sure it doesn't have the Apple logo on there, but other than that it's identical to the cable that came with his IPhone 3G. I'm glad I didn't read the reviews until after I'd purchased this item."
3,Doc connector,"I like this item i am using it now for a while the only problem I have is that this item is very fragile, if you push on it a lil bit harder while trying to connect it to your phone it may break. Other than that it is a good product for it's price."
2,"Ok item, you get what you pay for","It took a little longer (about a week) than I was told for the item to arrive. I had to contact the seller and ask them to resend. I purchased 2 USB cords and I'm glad that I did. One cord stopped working 2 weeks after I received it. It works well for charging your phone, however if you're wanting to synch your phone, you're out of luck. It will show that your phone is synching, but when you check, you'll see that it actually didn't synch. For the price I've paid, the item serves it purpose of charging my phone. If you're not expecting more than that, you won't be disappointed."
2,So so,This connector does this job but it does not have the release button that the original Ipod came with. It will do if nothing else comes along.
3,Works...,"The cable works fine, but they are much lower quality than the original cables that came with your iProduct. This is not unexpected for a $0.89 cable."
1,The cables do not work well,The cables do not work well with the ipod 3rd generation. You cannot listen to the ipod while it is plugged into the power supply. All other cables work well while plugged into the power supply but these cable will not allow you to do it. I experimented with other similar cables and the ones that came from Apple for the ipod. They work well. I then exchanged to these cables and again had problem. They recharge okay with a power supply but you can't listen to music while they are recharging. My wife tried these cables on her ipod and had the same problem.
1,Cheap,"Product is cheap and of poor manufacture; routinely causes my iPod to disconnect and reconnect to my computer at the slightest bump of my iPod, potentially leading to data loss. Avoid!"
1,Warning: Truth in Labeling...,"WARNING: the picture of this product is NOT what you get, and it is made by ""Inspiretech"", not Apple as claimed. Yes, it seems to charge my iPhone 3G which is all I really need it to do, but there should be some truth in labeling for these Amazon external sellers..."
1,Not an Apple product ! Spotty performance,"Do NOT Use this cable. Despite the fact that the seller has identified this as being an Apple product, it's not. It's made by a company called Inspire Tech. I notified Amazon that the product details are wrong, but there's been no resolution. I would never have purchased this cable if that info hadn't been wrong. I bought two and one didn't work at all and other cut out after a few uses.Some reviewers have said that the cost is low enough that you can afford to buy a bunch a throw away the ones that don't work... I really don't agree with that. Using a bad cable on any device that draws power through the cable is a recipe for a screwed up device. It's a risk that's not worth taking considering the cost of the devices you're hooking up to it! Avoid! Amazon sells a retractable iPod/iPhone cable that is about $9 and performs perfectly."
1,NOT the real deal,"Contrary to what is advertised and what other 'reviewers' indicate, the product I received was not a genuine Apple product and was indeed a cheap imitation. The product was inexpensive, but this doesn't justify patently false advertising."
2,Does not work as stated,"Pros: The product does allow the iPhone 3G to be charged, but the plug gets pretty warm compared to using the original cable.Cons: The product does NOT allow you to sync the iPhone, which makes this product quite useless.Cons: It also looks very much like an imitation product. Guess you gotta pay the full $17 to enjoy the benefits of a real product."
1,This is not the product shown in the picture.,The picture is of an original connector. The product shipped is a very cheap copy.
5,Works as advertised,I have a 3GS and this cable works perfectly. It charges the phone and also allows for syncing the same as the original cable that came with my phone. I bought two so now I have a cable I keep at work and one for traveling. Can't beat this deal.
1,Buyer Beware - Not as advertised,"This cable is (a) NOT an Apple-made cable, (b) NOT iPhone compatible (you can tell by looking at the pinouts - the iPod connector has 4 active pins on the dock-end of the cable, the iPhone connector has 5) and is (c) NOT reliable.A Dock connector cable for iPhones (as opposed to a simple charging cable) requires 5 active pins (you would see a copper conductor at positions 4, 6, 8, 10 and 15). This cable has the standard iPod conductor arrangement (4,6,8,15).The unit would not permit sync for either my iPhone or my iPod, and would only charge my iPod when connected to the AC converter, and even then it was twitchy (would drop and restablish charging without any stimulus).Wish there were a zero-star review.Point being, spend the money - get an Apple cable or go with a well-known 3rd-party brand like Griffin or Belkin."
3,"It basically works, but it's not what you expect!","This is most definitely not an Apple product. Don't let the Amazon photo fool you; it's a misleading product image!However, yeah, I was able to connect my iPhone to my MacBook Pro. Data syncing worked. Recharging worked. So if you're looking to spend the last possible money, then this product should work well. The phone connector is a little goofy in how it attaches/detaches because it does not have the squeeze tabs/button for release (whereas the original Apple product does). Take a little care when disconnecting and it shouldn't be a big issue.It ain't Apple; the Amazon photo is wrong. This cheap knock off does, in fact, work and will save you a few bucks."
2,Nice Connector....but....,"This is a nice connector, a great price....but it is not as it appears in the photograph, nor is it a genuine Apple product, as other reviewers note; would rate it higher were it not for that misrepresentation of the provenance/manufacture of the cable."
2,Good but not as advertised,"The cable seems to work OK but the iPod/iPhone connector at the ""iPod end"" is larger than a genuine Apple connector, so it may not fit through some cases that have tight clearance. Otherwise the cable seems fine and works well.BUT, the seller uses a picture of an actual Apple branded cable and calls it an ""Apple Dock Connector to USB 2.0 Cable"". Under that they have a link to ""Other products by Apple"" even though this isn't a product by Apple.Now for $3.29, I knew I wasn't getting an Apple branded unit, but they shouldn't misrepresent it. It should say iPod cable and/or list the manufacturer and they should have an accurate picture."
1,Guilty of false advertising,Buyer beware. This is not an Apple USB connector as the seller would have you believe by the picture and description. This cable is a cheap knock off and BargainCell knows it. This is deliberate false advertising and I am shocked Amazon still allows this person/company to sell their junk here.
2,"Apple, really??","There's nothing that irritates me more than a company who uses a registered trademark, in this case Apple, and doesn't convey the word ""compatible"" anywhere in the ad or product description and still gets away with being on Amazon. This is false advertising and in the case of using Apple's name to make an assumption about the quality of product, is fraudulent. This USB cable is a compatible product and is not a genuine Apple connection cable. After several days of use, it does work as it should, but I will not purchase another product from this company, since it appears they are intentionally deceiving Amazon customers."
1,NOT what I ordered!!! Photo shows Apple brand cable.,NOT what I ordered. The photo shows an Apple brand cable. I got a crummy knock-off. Very cheap. Very hard to insert into iPhone and equally hard to remove. I don't want to use for fear of damaging my iPhone and voiding the warranty. Skip this item. It is a blatant lie!
3,Works but it's not as good as the ones made by Apple,"The cable and connectors looked like they are cheaply made. The iPod connector is the older style that requires pushing buttons on the sides to release from the device while the newer Apple cables no longer requires that action. So far it seems to work for both charging and syncing, even with the latest iPhone. Perhaps it's acceptable given the low price but I would definite prefer the real thing if I need another one."
1,Do not buy this product,This product is not made by Apple as claimed on the product page. I mistaken ordered two of these cables. One was defective out of the box. I now see that many other people have had similar problems. Why hasn't this product been removed by Amazon?
2,It is not by apple.,"Although the cable fits my ipod and it serves its purpose, the description says ""BY APPLE"" but it is not."
1,Simply bad...,"It feels cheap compared to a real apple connector. I wouldn't mind that if the thing actually worked though. I plugged it in and the ipod and the macbook did recognize each other, but the ipod wouldn't charge. It did work for itunes, but the transfer speeds were REALLY slow and it would make itunes freeze after a while. Don't buy this!"
1,CHEAP KNOCK OFF,"It looks like the real thing...but oh no, no its not. Better off with the real product from apple. The shipping was fast."
1,Not an Apple product - wish I read the reviews before,The cable I received is a cheap Chinese cable and not an Apple cable. Bought via AccessoryOne for 1.69. Its not worth to ship it back - I suggest you contact the seller to make sure they will ship an Apple made cable.
3,Excellent for iPhone 4 & Classic 5th gen,"I was very weary about purchasing these cords after seeing so many negative reviews on here but now that they are here and I've tested them out they're perfect. I ordered two and they look like carbon copies of my original cord that came with my iPhone 4. Both my iPod classic 5th generation & iPhone 4 sync to the computer (Win 7 x64 Ultimate) perfectly. I'm glad I ordered these as they were about 1/20 of the cost of a cord from anywhere else.Update 1/1/2011:Failed to recognize Ipod when connected. Cord looks exactly as it did the day I purchased it, but 3 different computers will no longer charge the Iphone with this cord. Tried a different Ipod cord and works fine. Lasted an ok length of time for just $3 (with bulk order + shipping), but now I'm in the market for another cord."
1,Does not work,"I received my cable yesterday. We have an apple iphone 3G and 3GS. It charges the 3G. It will not charge the 3GS. It will not synchronize with the computer (windows XP) for either phone, it just keeps buzzing."
5,"Exactly as pictured, looks like oem",Let me start by saying that this cable is exactly as is pictured on Amazon! If you are looking for an iPod cable- buy this one.There are several negative reviews on here that are false and I believe must be posted by competitors. I took a chance and ordered anyway and I'm really glad that I did because the cables arrived today and they are identical to the cable that came with my iPhone 4 in every way. They function perfectly.Shame on those who post incorrect reviews and even go so far as to post false photos! I'm glad I didn't listen.
1,Horrible!,"I spent about $4 on this product and it doesn't work at all! I connected it to my pc, and there's no sign of charging or anything! I was so frustrated."
1,Disconecting al the time,"With these cables the iPhone keeps disconnecting all the time from my MacBookPro. Not sure what the problem is, but they aren't working as they should. Other cables work fine."
4,Worth the money,"Since im always loosing my chargers i wasnt feeling paying $20 each time at wallyworld or best buy. I couldnt believe the price these were going for and based on the reviews i figured id give them a chance myself and give my own review. I bought 7 just to have a few on hand for work, home, car etc. Only used 3 so far and all work just like they should. Even if only 1 worked i would have still been happy since it still would be cheaper than one from any where else. Purchased this for my iphone 3g and they work great. Also works with my itouch. Will i buy more? In a heart beat."
2,WORKS WITH ELECTRICAL OUTLET,THIS CABLE ONLY WORKS WITH ELECTRICAL OUTLET TO CHARGE . DOES NOT WORK WITH IPHONE 4 TO CONNECT COMPUTER USB
1,Garbage,"Sometimes I want to kick myself for going the cheap route. This piece of junk shorted my ipod touch out. Totally broken, no reset tricks worked, apple said they could replace it for a $200 fee. 100% FRIED. I lost all of my saved pictures and everything else I had on it. Yes I should've backed it up, and YES I should have shelled out a few extra bucks and paid for something from the apple manufacturer."
1,Check out the pictures they don't advertise!,I am mostly disappointed in myself for falling for their awful advertising. Just avoid these guys at all costs. I'd rather buy straight from apple and break the bank as opposed to getting cheap garbage from these guys.
3,usb-to-ipod/iphone/ apple dock connector with short cable,"This is a short white cable with a USB ""A"" plug on one end, and an apple-dock for ipod/iphone on the other.It works as expected with the iphone.It arrived on time and in good shape."
5,Great price,The cable arrived quickly and in perfect condition. Why buy this at a store when you can get it online for less. I ordered several things to get the super saver discount.
5,USB cable for ipod nano,After you say that the cable does exactly what it was intended to do -- transfer files and charge the ipod -- you've said it all. I am using it as I type this.It is a simple product that fills a need and does it well.
1,do not buy iphone cord from OEM shop,You get what you pay for! I purchased an iPhone cord from OEM Shop a few months back so I could charge my phone in my car. It is already not working! I contacted them asking if they could replace it since it had only been a few months and they said it was past the 7 days. 7 days?! I've had my other iPhone cord for 2 years and it is still working. They sell junk products. Beware.
1,don't know did not receive the product,i can't say i can give a good review considering i never received the product in the mail
1,poor conectivity did not work to play music--should have returned just the low cost kept me from returning all.,This product did not work the only thing it is good for is charging my iphone. Will not play music from my Ipod. Items should be replaced with working models. James Ruthardt
1,Junk,"I'm not sure why, but this charges my phone so slowly that I can't even use my phone with it plugged in. The battery would die while it was plugged in, but then if I left it alone for awhile, it would start to charge up. As soon as I tried to use my phone again (still plugged in), the battery would die. Junk and not worth the hassle to return. I've already ordered another one...hopefully one that works."
2,"It works, but not very well.","It does work, but only if the cable is situated just right. If I move my device even slightly it disconnects and then reconnects immediately which iTunes hates. This would stop any sync, software upgrade, or music that's playing in iTunes.If you're using it just to charge your phone like I do, it's a really good deal. I can't say I'd recommend this to anyone though. Do yourself a favor and buy a higher quality cable."
3,Not Apple,"I just received my cable and it arrived promptly. I haven't used it yet but I wasn't pleased to see that it was an off-brand, when it says in the ad that it's Apple. We'll see how it goes. It was cheap and my vacuum ate my other one so I can't be too picky."
4,"Not the genuine Apple product, but it works","This item was listed as ""Apple Dock Connector to USB 2.0 Cable (White)"". I thought that meant it was the genuine Apple cable, but what I got (supplied by ClearAV) was an aftermarket cable, not the genuine Apple cable. It is not as elegant as the genuine Apple cable, and it has a sort of new vinyl smell, but it works."
3,"Fair cable, plug too tight almost damaged my iPod","Cable works well, however the plug attached so tightly to my iPod that it almost got damaged."
1,Terrible craftsmanship,"It's a cable. How can you screw it up?You make it so the metal connector slides off the plastic cable.I used this cable for about 2 minutes. I plugged it into my iPod charger. I pulled the cable out gently. The cable came out. The metal plug stayed in.My guess is at this price, their QA can afford to take a break."
3,WARNING!! VISTA USERS!!,"This item is great, however, do NOT buy if you have windows vista. I have tried it on my windows vista and it seems to just connect and re connect like theres a problem with the ipod. I tried it with my windows computer and no problems. So be careful when buying!!"
1,Not as advertised,"This is NOT the product in the photo and NOT an Apple product. This matters because it is advertised as by Apple. These cables are bulkier than the original Apple cables and don't fit properly.I purchased three of these cables from AccessoryOne and none were the item in the photo or an Apple product. They all shipped in the same package but each item required separate shipping/handling cost ($2.98 each). Though the cable is inexpensive, be aware, the Shipping/handling exceeds the cost of the item and seems to be non-refundabe if you return the product, so you loose. Also the Return procedure for this company is so 'un-amazon and requires more effort.To be fair, this company does carry the correct Adapter (the after recall ""Green dot"" Adapter-Original Apple USB Power Adapter for iPod, iPhone, iPhone 3G and iPhone 3Gs) for iPhones and iPods, and they work very well."
1,This probably violates Apple's patent,"Not only is this cable not as reliable as Apple's, the fact that they made so similar to Apple's cable is pretty deceptive. It probably violates Apple's patent. This company could at least have painted it black or something different."
1,Don't waste your dollar.,I plugged this cable into my car stereo and now it only works half the time. My stereo keeps telling me that it cannot read my ipod. Get the real thing instead.
1,Charge but no sinc,My ipod charges when the Dock Connector is used to connect to my computer but my iPod does not sinc. When I use the Apple connector my ipod charges and sincs normally.
1,NOT ORIGINAL,DON'T BUY. It fried my 1st gen ipod nano. I plugged it in via this wire into an ORIGINAL Apple adapter and the nano wouldn't work anymore. This cable is advertised as being from APPLE but it's not. It's a cheap Chinese imitation of it. STAY AWAY!!!!! BOO lost of $70 plus. $65 for ipod $5 for cable.
4,4 out of 5,My only complaint was it didnt say (or I missed it) in the description that you can't charge it and listen at the same time on a nano - the cable connector is in the way of the headphone jack....The cable works great and was sent in a timely mannor :)
1,Product is worthless,I bought this cable and it will not even work with my PC. Don't waste your money or time with this product. Pay a bit more and get the real thing that works..Trust me!!!!!
1,DONT BUY FROM THIS GUY!!!!,the item was not in thew shape i was told it would be in. the guy was a total douche bag. DIDNT WANT TO GIVE ME MY MONEY BACK I HAD TO GET IT FROM AMAZON. this guy was totally verbally abusive and will never do business again.
1,Not very good,"Only works half the time, and of the times when it does work, half of those times it says ""CHARGING IS NOT SUPPORTED WITH THIS ACCESSORY.""Oh well..."
5,USB Connector,This usb connector is great...got 3 for a great deal. The same connector at apple runs for $19.99 so I think I got a pretty good deal for 3....would definetly recommend.
1,Never got it,So I was waiting weeks and weeks for this cord but it never came. Then one day I find out its at the post office bein held there because there wasn't enough stamps! But it was too late to get it and now it's impossible. I will spend my time and money on a much better choice and never again on this one.
4,Connect Four,"This is a absolutely great buy, no drawbacks, no dank little disappointments, perfectly happy in my purchase. Cheap but not at the sake of quality and fast shipping to boot. Two massively pleased thumbs up.-Hard to Please(finally pleased)"
5,Dime a dozen,"Cables are inexpensive, i buy a bunch at a time, keep a few at home, work and in the car. Some break by having the cord ripped out of the connector peace. Not a problem b/c price is so low. They work great, and charge without any issues."
1,Don't purchase this one.,"Probably should have paid more for this item, because it was really cheap. Could not remove from my ipod touch. Pulled and pulled and the wires stripped out. Finally got it out and my ipod was not damaged."
1,Does NOT work with iPhone 4,"I wanted to be able to connect my iPhone 4 to my computer instead of disconnecting my cord from my charger near my bed, so I ordered this cord. IT DOES NOT CONNECT MY IPHONE 4 TO MY COMPUTER. It doesn't even register. If you're looking for something for your iPhone 4, then please don't order this. I wish I had read the reviews. Waste of money. My apple cord has Apple written on the cord wire....this has nothing, and doesn't even resemble my iPhone 4 cord. The description is a LIE. please don't buy."
1,"Not an Apple product, and did not work.","The product I received was defective, it would not charge my Ipod, nor did it sync with Itunes on my computer.I'm very disappointed, and will be buying the $19.99 one in a store. It seems somethings you shouldn't buy on the cheap, like tuna and Ipod USB cables. I'm currently trying to return this product. And It is NOT an Apple product, just a knock off."
1,Simply dead on arrival,I bought an iphone connector from them in September. It last 3 months before it is dead. I thought it was an accident so I purchased a second one from them. I patiently waited for more than a week and finally when I got it it just simply didn't work from day 1.It's a complete waste of time and money.
1,basically useless,The cable I purshased from Abacus24-7 does not work correctly. It is not a real Apple product. It is a cheap knock off. It does connect and mount the iPod but instead of charging the iPod it drains the charge from iPod battery in about 10 minutes. Do NOT buy this from this seller.
2,Not as Described or Shown,"My cable works, but is not the Apple-branded cable shown on the picture; I received an unbranded cable that said only ""Made in China"" and a model number."
3,"You Sell it Cheap, The Product Is Cheap! Go Figure!",I received the items quickly but were not as shown. The items were made of cheap plastic Made in China low quality.
3,Does the job and that's about it,"This cable does not have the nice apple logo on one side of the connector like the original, and behaved flaky (didn't charge my ipod) on one of my USB sockets, although it worked on the other. If you've lost your ipod cable and need a replacement to charge / transfer songs, this thing will do the job for you a lot cheaper than ordering one from Apple."
5,Great Buy,"And to think I almost paid $13-$20 at a brick and mortar store for this product (that probably costs 13 cents to manufacture). Cheap, works well, and arrived very quickly. Can't ask for more."
3,"Worked with iPhone, but not with iPad","Ordered two of these cables from BTO, Inc. They seem to work fine with iPhone (charge and sync) but are flaky with the iPad (sometimes will charge, sometimes will sync, but sometimes doesn't do either). Just got them but seems like the more I try them with the iPad, the less likely they are to work. I'll just use them with the iPhone. For the price (incredibly low) I can live with that limitation."
1,This caused my iPod to short out and turn off,"These are not the same as the ones sold by Apple. I bought 3 because the price was so low. These are not OEM and they caused my iPod to short out only to be revived by a soft reset. The ones I ordered were fulfilled by a company called Nextweb, but it seems that no one is actually getting the correct items. I wouldn't buy these cables or recommend them to anyone because they cause the iPod to freeze."
3,iPod USB,"It has difficulty inserting into the iPod. Most likely because it doesn't have the release buttons on the sides.For some reason when connected to my computer, my iPod didn't appear in my iTunes, but it did when I switched to the Apple brand USB.It works fine connected to the car stereo."
1,Mine broke,This cable worked fine for a month and then it broke. The casing for the part that connects to the phone came apart and I couldn't put it back together. It's not as well made as the actual cables from Apple.
1,It doesn't work!,It only worked maybe twice and now it doesn't work at all. Definitely not worth it.
1,Garbage,"I read some of the other reviews but figured that whatever I received would at least function correctly. When the cord arrived it was generic, which was slightly annoying, but if it worked, whatever. I tried to sync my ipod with my laptop and it took several tries before it would work. The second time I tried to sync there was absolutely no way to make the cord work. I used the original apple cord with no problems immediately after.Bottom line, it is not an Apple product. Worse yet, it doesn't even work properly. This item should be removed from Amazon, and the companies that sell it should be banned. I did not follow up with the company, as it would waste too much of my time for a $2.88 refund. I will take the time to report Amazon and the vendor to the FTC, because no one should have to deal with getting scammed... even for just a couple of dollars."
1,did not work,"I am very unsatisfied with this product because it doesn't work. When I plug it in to my ipod and the usb drive, it looks like it is uploading the new music that is on the computer but it never does. I will not buy it online again."
5,Works as advertised,It just works....not much to talk about a silly adapter cable. The connectors are solid and function the same as the oem one. Great little cable for the money.
2,Dock to USB 2.0 cable for ipod,"I bought this item thinking I would be able to charge my 3rd gen ipod via usb to the computer. This is not possible. The usb connector only allows you to transfer data, at a snails pace compared to firewire. So I wound up purchasing the complete firewire package; Dock connector and the charger."
3,"Eh, it's okay","I bought the ""Apple iPod Dock Connector"" as a replacement for my old one when I thought I lost it. I figured it was cheap and it did say specifically ""APPLE"", so what the heck. When it arrived, I immediately realized it was NOT indeed anything Apple, but a knock off. That being said, for a knock off, it isn't bad. Sometimes it has a little trouble (and for whatever reason my computer only reads it as a 1.1 rather than a 2.0) but overall it's not bad and it works. Just watch out-- it may look inexpensive, but the shipping price will kill you!!!!"
5,great price,"The product was shipped as promised. Only complaint is that I thought it was an actual ipod product. It is a generic, but works and looks exactly the same. Thaanx for the product."
3,It's not an Apple product,"The connectors I received were not Apple products, they are imitations. The one I am using recharges my Iphone 3G, it does not over heat. This is false advertisement. I wonder if Amazon can get in trouble for this..."
3,by who?,"This product was advertised as ""by Apple"". Clearly it is not. It is a clear knock off that still does the job albeit with a much chunkier more plastic snap on connector. Where the apple logo should be is the USB symbol. This is not by Apple. The color match is not even close. This very off white, near cream colour cord does the job but should not be tooted as ""by Apple"". Maybe ""for Apple iPods"" is better.Review wise it either works or it doesn't - this dock connecter works on PC, MAC, XBOX 360, PS3, & Eternal Speakers. This dock connector works with all generations of iPod Classic, iPod, iPod Nano (1st, 2nd & 3rd gen), iPod Touch (1st & 2nd gen). I have tried on all the iPods listed. I have not tried on my iPhone yet."
1,Not an apple product,"I wanted another iphone cord that so that I could have a cord to charge the phone by my bed, as well as have one for the road. As this appears to not be a genuine apple product, it doesn't work very well with the iphone. The mechanism that grasps the phone so that it can be held in place as it charges is apparently not existence because it will repeatedly vibrate as it is coming in and out of the phone. Also, it seems as if it has caused a glitch in my phone. If I leave it to be fully charged, the battery indicator reads full no matter what! I have yet to see this go away and I really hope this does not void the warranty on the phone. Bottom line, if you are willing to have a 5-6 hundred dollar phone, it may be in your best interests to go the extra mile and get a legitimate cord for it."
3,ok,its a cable s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s sssssssssssssssssss sssssssssssss sssssss
2,I did not like it,"I did not like it, it did not work properly and I my phone would not charged with it, it was misleading"
1,Not compatible with iPod as advertised,"This connector (pack of 3) works fine with my iPhone, but is not compatible with my iPod. Even though the package of three connectors costs far less than the Apple product, it should work as advertised, and it did not."
2,USED??,"Unlike what everybody said, I actually did get the original Apple brand. However, when I opened the package, the cord was definitely not new. It was so obvious that it wasn't new. it was in fact USED when it was listed under the new item. Also, I didn't get a receipt in the package like most online orders do. I thought that was strange. I definitely think this seller is trying to rip people off."
1,Don't waste your money,"I just got my charger in the mail and was so happy. Open it up and well it looks cheap, and it was. I plugged it into my iPhone and when it came time to take my phone off the charger, I couldn't get the charger out. Finally after lots of pulling and prying I was able to get it out of my phone. While charging any little bump causes it to stop charging. Don't waste your money on this product."
5,USB IPod cable,"Fast service and a great buy. Made my wife happy.. As they say ""if mama's not happy no one is""."
1,Product fell apart during first use,"I would not normally bother to take time on such an inexpensive item. However, this product is shockingly bad. I plugged the connector into my iphone. The phone charged. Upon disconnecting the entire connector body tore in half leaving the metal piece lodged in my iphone. I had to get a pair of needle nose pliers and gently work the metal connector face out of my iphone. I was lucky it did not destroy the iphone. Stay away from this cheap chinese junk!"
5,Great product for a great price!,I purchased this Tim to have an extra. It works great. I have had no problems charging my phone or iPad using this device! Great buy for a great price. As good as apple and for less.
1,garbage,"It doesn't even work. The second we plugged it in it didn't charge anything. Waste of money, if you ask me."
2,You get what you pay for,"It works, but it is very cheaply made. I am glad that I got two of them because I am sure that it will not last. Like I said you get what you pay for. I am glad that I did not pay more for the item or I would have to send them back and get my money back. Buying from out of the country is really not a good idea, I do not think I will do it again."
5,It does what its supposed to do..,"Its cheap and came rather quickly, which was a definite plus when I got an ipod from a friend and didn't have a way to charge it."
1,Dont recommend,"I bought 5 of these at an unbelievable price - but after realizing they only sometimes work, i see why."
4,A bargain that works!,The cord is long enough to reach across a cabinet or car seat and the plug fits snugly into the port on the IPOD. It works as well as the original equipment at a fraction of the price.
1,A complete waste of time.,"I ordered this inexpensive cable thinking a cable is a cable so why pay more. I received my order and it failed to work after the first hour of use. I contacted the seller and they promptly responded and sent a replacement at no cost. The replacement arrived and it failed to work at all. There would seem to be no quality control going on with this seller. I'm not going to try a third, I just broke down and paid the $20 at Walmart for the legit Apple product. Yes, way over priced but guess what. it works as it should. I cannot recommend this product."
4,GREAT,this is one of the finest CD in contemporary jazz--I don't purchase too many CDs but this one is a keeper
1,"Eric does his thing, but it's tough to dig","Eric Marienthal is an excellent saxophonist, excelling in smooth, straight ahead, and big band jazz. That said, it's really tough to hear Cannonball's classics, both the bop and soul jazz tunes, rendered so smoothly. Eric's version of Mercy, Mercy, Mercy lacks all the soul that made the original so hip. I involuntarily cringed after the transition between Cannonball's spoken word intro and the new, oh-so-smooth drum machine groove. Work Song is supposed to be a field blues sung by slaves, and the original really does so with a driving, intense feel. This version is just weak and, let's face it, extremely white.If you like smooth jazz, Eric Marienthal is an excellent player of that genre, but if you are expecting a Cannonball tribute that actually captures the soul behind Cannonball's music, this isn't it. Extremely smooth interpretations lacking the fire that made Cannonball such a master."
5,Wonderful tribute to Cannonball Adderley,This is a wonderful CD with echoes of the stylings and feel of Cannonball Adderley. It grows on you as you listen to it and it's a great way to spend part of a quiet evening. It offers me a mental escape from a house full of the sounds of young children. I can tell the artist invested soul and a love of music in the creation of this album.
4,Eric is a monster player - check it out!,"It is refreshing to hear someone like Eric update the sound of Cannonball Adderly. If you really want to hear him blow, you should check out his playing on George Kahn's new CD ""Out of Time"" on playing records. Until you can get your hands on that release, ""Walk Tall"" will do."
1,"Saccharine, slick, cliched, and overproduced","This guy has not one iota of soul, which stands in stark contrast to Cannonball, who was soul personified. I'm sure he'll sell a lot of records to people who want to hear ear candy, and that's pretty sad."
1,Cheap looking - not worth it,"Not what I expected. This book is pretty cheap looking and thin, and really not worth it even for the fun, lighthearted gift book niche it's designed to fill. There are nicer books for your money out there."
2,Should have been better,"I was hoping for something on the level of ""Superman Batman: World's Finest"". I bought this the 1st day released based on how good the comic was. The comic was way better. This movie is just disappointing because it was an oversimplification, they cut so much and rewrote so much to cram it into 67 minutes. It loses alot of the menacing of Lex Luthor being president and is basically a big fight without substance. One of the best things about the comic was seeing Superman and Batman's contrasting thoughts and what they really thought of each other - this movie leaves that out. And while Batman does, Superman doesn't look quite like McGuiness drew him. Also some language was beyond the realm of the cartoons and didn't serve anything - the occurrences were just glaringly unfortunate.All in all If you're a fan of either Superman or Batman series you'll want to see this and maybe if you didn't read the comic book storyline, you'll like it more."
3,"Ok,but too predictable!","I was really looking forward to this movie,but it proved to be much too predictable. For one thing,I remember seeing a similar scenerio being played out on Justice League Unlimited and I didn't care for it then either. The animation was good and the voice work was excellent,but you didn't have to be a rocket scientist to go where the plot was going and how it would end. Considering the number of heroes and villians shown on screen,the absence of Flash,Wonder Woman,Green Lantern and Green Arrow was rather odd in my view. I did enjoyed the extras,particularly the discussion between Kevin Conroy,Greg Norvek(?)and Andrea Romano over dinner. I was really shocked to find out that Conroy had never done any animation voice work before getting chosen to be the voice of Batman. Overall,the movie was ok and I would recommend it,but only for those who did not see the 13 part JLU story."
4,Pretty good,"i watched this movie earlier and it was pretty good. i was glad some the voices we have known as superman and batman were kept the same. I am also glad we actually got a different look at a nemesis of supermans and its not lex luther (think WB animated series)""sorry I don't want to spoil things for people who may not know much about the story. I think animation wise I was good with it. No series changes. was glad that the DC universe was opened up some and we saw some of the other characters. Storyline was good, I was into it, and felt good about my hour or so spent watching it. Bats & Sups are still quality even straight to dvd"
4,good movie,i liked this movie as i got free coupon for this :) . good story good animation and action. worth watch
5,for husband,"he loves all this DVD's.he has several books on the comic series' and says the dvd's stay really close to the stories as in the comic books.great purchase.packaged well, fast deliver, newthank you"
4,A must see for the fans!!,"This movie was actually quite good. I enjoyed viewing it. To start off with my review the story line was impressive, one of DC universe better animated movies. The picture and sound quality was totally amazing. If u'r a fan of the series you should get u'rself a copy like I did and watch it in a HI-DEF surround Sound set-up. Thank you for reading my review"
2,very disappointed,"I've gotten DC's previous direct to DVD videos (Superman Doomsday, New Frontiers, Wonder Woman and Green Lantern First Flight) and enjoyed them all. Now we have Superman Batman: Public Enemies. What a disappointment. The animation was blocky, with all of the male characters having similar bodies. Power Girl, oh my goodness.The plot would have been merely passable had I not read the graphic novel on which it's based, but there is so much missing from the book that it's a travesty. Sure, books are always more detailed than movies, but the movie is 67 minutes. Could they have made it 90 minutes and maybe incorporated Kal-L, the assault on the White House and Captain Atom's sacrifice?I'll keep buying the DC videos as they are released and have a good track record with me, but this one was not good."
2,Not really clear...,"... on why Power Girl and Captain Marvel were on Earth 1 instead of Earth 2 and Earth S, respectively. And it's a little weird that Superman would be talking about Lois Lane to Alfred."
4,Digital Copy Games Continue,"Great Movie, but what is up with WB? First Green Lantern now Superman and Batman! The Digital Copy will only work with the Windows Media Player. Why not make it universal or advertise that its a WMP compatible only?"
3,PG 13 is getting old.,"I will admit I haven't read the comic. As someone who is middle aged I'm tired of the PG-13 content. The Contentmaking it PG-13 was completly unnecessary. I can't stand it on the cover when the PG-13 is put out there like a badge of honor. It was a good story, great artwork. The voice over work by the guys from the Animated series of Batman, superman was outstanding. But once again the big heads at Warner think they have to market to teens..."
3,This could have been a What if story.,The art work reminded me of Batman Gotham knight. The storyline was very hard to believe. but if you put the what if into the story then its a little more original in its concept.The fight scenes were great to watch and having toy man as a child (Is that the same toy man who is a villain in the Dc world?}was interesting. The storyline does waiver towards the end but all in all it was a great anime to watch and own on Blu ray.
3,Simplified,"Since its about an hour or so, the characters aren't too developed. The story line seems rushed. It also seems to have been simplified to appeal to a broader range of audience, for newbies to kids. You are better off purchasing the Justice League Complete Series DVD."
4,Almost like a comic,Like a comic you dont have to read. Its a little short for a movie but gets the job done. I like how they put so many supers and villians in with out getting off the subject. Be careful if you have kids under 10 because there is some profanity and blood and of course violence.
2,sort of a dissapointment,"So most reviews on this movie were pretty good, but I was honestly let down by this one. Having read the comic, it really seemed like they took some of the best parts out (Captain Atom saving the world, and The Teen Titan White House Invasion.) If you're looking for a fun animated action movie it won't disapoint, but if ypu've read the comic, and you're hoping for the film version you'll be disapointed. Maybe I expected too much out of it, but I was unimpressed.)"
4,thunder buddies for life,"I rather enjoyed the comedic and ""brotherly"" affection that Sups and Bats displayed towards each other throughout this movie untill the end when Bats goes back to being his true self and ninja disappears...awesome. Also, a plethora of villians up in this one, so if you're down for action, this one has got plenty! Aloha."
2,"Fight fight fight fight fight, the end","Luthor is president, and he has something up his sleeve. That's the plot. The rest of the movie is Superman and Batman fighting an endless string of DC villians. No seriously, it's like 40 straight minutes of nothing but punch punch punch and then the next wave of bad guys shows up and punch punch punch. The end. That's literally it. Yawn."
2,Miles behind,"This was a real disappointment. The quality of the animation is frequently jerky, artistically lower than Saturday morning fare and miles behind last year's Gotham Knight. There's no reason to spend the money on a Blu-Ray for something with so little detail. Bodies are blocky and distorted, faces are expressionless.The voice acting isn't much better, with the exception of the always excellent Clancy Brown. Batman and Superman deliver their lines in virtual monotones that are barely distinguishable from each other. Dialogue is laughable, and the story isn't much better. The action sequences, while serviceable, don't rise to the level that they can redeem the movie's other flaws. If you're a fan of Superman or Batman, avoid this."
5,Absolutely incredible!,"Keeping in mind the fact that they were trying to turn a six-issue story arc into a 67 minute film, you have to be impressed by this movie. Kevin Conroy, Clancy Brown, and Tim Daly are all back lending their voices to the roles that made them famous (in animated circles, anyway) as Batman, Luthor, and Superman. Most of the powerful moments from the comic story are here, and there are some incredible cameos from villains and heroes like Black Lightning, Catman, Deadshot, Hawkman, Captain Marvel, Solomon Grundy, and a dozen more. There's a lot to like here, so if you're looking for a great way to spend an hour, invest in this.DC is doing a great job of cranking out quality animated movies. After ""First Flight"", we were given this. I can't wait to see what they have planned next. I'm hoping ""Blackest Night"" will eventually find its way to an animated movie someday."
5,No one is above the law...,"Apparently no one told the creators of this movie that :P. It is too good. Anytime you can get Kevin Conroy (Batman), Tim Daly (Superman), and Clancy Brown(Lex Luthor) together in the same show/film/etc, you know it's going to be great. I didnt actually read the graphic novel this is based on so I actually went into it ""blindly"". What I got was a totally entertaining experience that can't be match easily. It was nice that Amanda Waller (voiced by CC Pounder) was included here as well because she was a personal fave of mine as a character although they way they drew her here was grotesque. But it didn't take away from the overall product, especially because of these two words.....Power Girl (or is that one word?)"
3,Not bad,"I gave it 3 stars only because I had read the comic and I found certain things were missing, or the action not as intense as the book. But it is nicely done. If you are a comic book fan or were even a fan of the show in the 1990s then it is worth picking up."
3,Chunky&Clunky,"They really should start making an adult version of these things, animation does not have to mean cartoony. The characters were way too chunky almost He-man like. Power Girl came off as big boobed dumb blond, they would have done much better using some of the founding JLU characters. The story seemed hurried(clunky)but had a good foundation. I didn't read the book so this is all I have to go on, it's not bad but certainly not as good as it could have been."
5,Lex As President,The movie show us what would happen if Lex was president. Only Batman and Superman can stop him. This is a great story and this is a great movie.
4,Not bad.,"To me, lex as the same as Obama. Over all I give it a 4 but I'm not the best person to review this movie."
4,Great movie,"Lex Luthor makes Superman look like a villain and puts a one billion bounty on him. Even superheros turn on him. But with Batman's help, Superman once again takes down the evil Lex. 4 stars."
5,Works great!,"This mould has worked out great for me. It is slightly bowed in a few areas, but you have to look hard to even see it. I have redone my sidewalk with it and plan to add a patio in the future. great product for the cost!"
4,Pathmate from Bargan Hunters,"The Pathmate molds should come in a pair (x2) as you see on the youtube videos. If you make a mistake and buy it from Bargan Hunters, as I did at first you get screwed and only get ONE!The molds are made of stong black plastic and look/feel durable. With two molds you can finish a second group of pavers while the first set is setting up and then rotate them for ultimate speed!I STRONGLY RECOMEND THAT YOU DO NOT buy anything from BARGAN HUNTERS as they maximize profits by selling you one at a time which will take you twice as long to do your project.BTW, Bargan Hunter's ad states that they are selling ""molds"" as the other vendors do but as I found out, you only get one mold. Also if you buy anything from them and the item is not as they advertised, they stick you with the freight on the return as well as do not refund the freight you paid on the way out.DO NOT USE BARGAN HUNTERS!"
2,Pathmate stepping stone molds,"When I received it, I mailed it right back to the seller. It was too warped to use that it will creat gap in between blocks adn won't be able to make straight ends. I was extremely bothered by the seller's intention. It was visibly not an acceptible product, but sent it to me wasting my time and money. He was charging me the returning expense too, but I had to write a lengthy letter to convince him that it was his responsibility since I didn't creat that problem.I want to order a new one, but am afraid that the result will be the same as other buyer described its flaw. My yard is all dug up and bare, I wasted too much time, and due to the weather, I might have to do my project next spring.[[ASIN:B001FA9SZM Belgian Cobblestone Mold"
2,returned it,It wasn't the style in the picture I wanted. There were no instructions in English with it . Returned it.
4,Pathmate Concrete Mold,"I am very happy with this heavy weighted plastic mold, I have not started this project yet as I have been working on the shade sails installation (digging holes & setting 4"" pipe) for a couple of week ends now. Sails will go up Easter weekend & the patio stones will start after that. Also, I showed my form to my sister & she bought the random stone mold & she is also happy, but has not started her project yet either. Once I begin, I plan on using a water based concrete stain on the stones for a random variation in the gray color family. My sister will use the concrete dye powder in her cement mix. :) Can't wait to get my patio done!!!"
2,Big Difference for Curb Appeal,"If you want your property to be the envy of the neighborhood, this will do it. Our front walkway was so narrow, guests had to walk in single file and was sunken, patched and just plain ugly. My husband used the Pathmate to create a walkway that is wide enough for two people to comfortably walk which really enhances a ""welcoming"" appearance, and it's the only front walk of its kind in the neighborhood! It's easy to use and clean up after the project is done."
5,STONE!,"Works great, looks great. Working with concrete is HARD. Don't think this will be your miracle patio that makes itself, but it will look great when it's done. I used this with another style mold and got some variety in my yard.Keep it clean. hit it with a hammer gently to loosen the grip the concrete has on the mold. depending on the heat/humidity/water mix and so forth a modl can take 3mins-10mins to set. I use lots of water on hot days to make life easier, but set time increases a lot."
4,Sturdy,"I have yet to build my walk with it yet, but the material is sturdy so I think this is going to be a winner"
2,Item Title Misleading,"4 stars for the item, 1 star for the seller and Amazon...I ordered this in the Belgium style mold and only received one mold. The items title, description, and various other places on the internet lead you to believe you get 2 molds not one. Amazon needs to make this seller specify they are only selling one mold, despite the title ""Pathmate Concrete Stepping Stone MOLDS"".Product works great, but would have been a faster job with 2 molds."
3,It is not as good of a book as people here are implying....,"This book was not what I expected when I purchased it; it was not that I was looking for a tremendous read, but I was looking for something that would hold my interest and provide some insight into the functions and interplay of popular culture and the market economy. I'm not sure that I found it.This is not to say that this is a bad book. Of books on popular culture, or books seeking to provide insight into 2001 America, this book is not even close to the best. Frank is a pundit attacking pundits: at times, he is witty; at times, he makes a good case for being brilliant. On the whole, though, this book could benefit from a good editing: I'm not sure that it has the substance to carry on for so many pages.It's not that I dislike this book: I just think that there are a lot of other books out there that say similar things in a more interesting fashion. And please, no ad hominem attacks here, either...."
2,Three words for the price of one: what a bargain---not!,"Having read Frank's ""What's the matter with Kansas?""---which I quite liked---I started this book. I looked forward to reading a critique of the ""Emperor's New Economic Paradigm"": that the almighty *Free Market* is the answer to all of America's problems. However, after struggling to stay awake through the first 50 pages, I cried ""uncle"". Frank is not content to make a point but must go on to remake it again and again ad nauseum. And to add injury to insult, the book's tiny, thin-line font is rather hard on the eyes even with my normal reading glasses."
3,Interesting but very repieitious,"I agree with most of what Frank says, and he generally says it well, but his book is much longer than it needs to be. The same few themes recur again and again, the same absurdities are repeatedly flogged, until you start thinking ""that horse is dead, start beating up on something else"". Another problem is that Frank doesn't do a very good job of explaining alternatives to the market. He gives us a lot of boilerplate about democracy and equality but not much insight about how increased government intervention in the economy would actually work."
3,"Good politics, bad social critique","I enjoyed reading the book, but found it to be terribly overstated at times. Frank is dead on with his message that economic democracy is not plutocracy, and that plutocracy was exactly the system that conservative and even centrist circles in the United States have been trying to get us to accept for some time. However, as a social critique the book overreaches and badly at that. As a critic of the ""culture industry,"" and reading many of the same publications that his cited articles and op-eds appeared in (and usually loathing the same authors), I do not see the propaganda tidal wave that he did. On this note, the book is propaganda about propaganda - entertaining, but to be looked at with a very skeptical eye."
1,A book that only unreconstructed labor unionists could like,"One Market Under God by Thomas Frank is a diatribe against the current American economic system by a discouraged believer in an exalted role for labor unions in the United States. The book has no thesis and no logical presentation. It is page after page of attack on everybody and everything that is powering our economic system. Frank decries the role into which organized labor has been pushed, but he fails to grasp the reasons for that situation and thus offers no remedy for the circumstance that troubles him so greatly."
1,"Ad Hominems are easy, folks...","Rather than address my points, the author's brother (the author's BROTHER?) chooses to deride my opinions, not with arguments or rationale, but by referring to me as ""Herr Lindner"". Oh well, I guess I'd laugh if it happened to someone else. Still, you're invited to check my review, and comment specifically on the merits of my arguments. It's probably a bit more difficult than insulting me, but so is tying one's shoes. (I am kinda funny lookin', now that ya mention it, though.)"
4,Know Thyself and Shudder,"Some people may find this book redundant, and indeed it is. Frank hammers home his main points, especially the audacity of the Free Marketeers in their efforts to blur the distinction between freedom and consumer choice. But the repetition is necessary, since the process that imprinted these ridiculous free market ideas on our brains is exactly the same. Endless advertising, spin, pundit-speak, and political/corporate syner-babble have brainwashed into seeing GNP, consumption, investment, jobs and other economic factors as the only appropriate matrix for social thought; and it requires an equally determined effort like Frank's to shake loose some of that haze. This book is excellent reading for people who want to understand how the ""historical inevitability of globalization"" is itself just another slickly-packaged product."
5,The moral fabric of the marketplace,"Frank is right on the money, no doubt about it. ""Free-markets"" and democracies aren't the same thing. Even the freest of markets can be bought, whereas democracies can't be...or can they?He documents the creepy cultural trends that have made us accept the marketplace as our ersatz democracy, why we've given up on the real version, and whom these trends really serve.Is modern culture really a tool used by the powers that be to undo the New Deal? It makes sense.I say this in the full knowledge that Frank devotes an entire chapter to my profession, in ""The Brand and the Intellectual"". When I finished reading it, I thought, ""I deserved that!"""
3,"Provocative, but a bit overstated","Thomas Frank's idea that the notion of free markets have essentially became a religion is a provactive one. It explains on a certain level the blind faith in the free market and on a certain level the de-regulation that has occurred. Many people had blind faith that markets could take care of themselves, and decided they didn't need to be regulated.The main problem with this book isn't that Frank can't support his claims: he can. Instead, the problem is that after awhile, the book becomes a bit repetitive. Frank establishes the point of blind faith in free-markets, and even how it occurred in a fairly short period of time. After a while it gets a bit tedious reading essentially the same thing over and over.While not bad, the book could have been better if it was more concise and had fewer case studies. This book is worth reading; however I did not consider it as good as What's the Matter with Kansas."
3,MEN'S WATCH,"NICE LOOKING WATCH, COULD USE LIL MORE SIZE N WEIGHT. BIGGEST PROBLEM IS GETTIN SMALL ENOUGH SCREW DRIVER TO RELEASE LINKS... OTHER THAN THAT , PLEASE WITH THE WATCH N LOOKS GREAT... HAS VERY NICE BOX WATCH COMES IN"
3,problem in water.,"Looks and function are very good but while swimming, the crown gotloose and it got foggy inside from the water.Need some proection because this is a diver watch.We sent it for repair in Stuhring company ,Brooklyn, NY and the customerserivce lady was very plesant. Hope it comes back ok."
5,Great Christmas Music,"This is one of my all time favorite Christmas Albums... I have the original 33 and it has been just realesed on CD and so I have that too. The CD sounds great, the music is great, Engelbert is great! Must own for anyone who likes Christmas music!"
4,GREAT Memories!!!,"When I was a kid, we used to have the big LP at home! I'm glad that I found it in Amazon and at such a low price!!!"
5,as advertised.,"I read the reviews posted on this sander, and they pretty well outlined what to expect. The Bosch 1276D is heavy and powerful. It is a perfect addition to my wood work tools as I have a light weight belt sander for the little jobs. Much more sander than what I need, but perfect for the big jobs, and no worry of hurting it for lack of power. For the price it is better than what I had expected. Don't get hooked into some of the so called rebuilt-refurbished companies that charge more than the new price. Cheaper by far than any of the same models that I looked at on Ebay. If you need a good HEAVY DUTY sander this is the one to pick. Requires some strong arms to use and control it. The exhaust could have been vented the other direction, but I still give it a 5 star. Also five stars to the seller for fast shipping-good price and good communication with a UPS tracking number."
3,Almost all good,"I bought this as a factory reconditioned unit at a fair price. It is heavy, not for small people, very strong, does what a belt sander should do. My issue with it is I can't get the belt to stay where it belongs; holding it free of wood and getting the belt just right, then sanding and having the belt begin to slide off the outside edge, adjusting it just a touch to bring it back and the next thing I see is the belt is crinkling itself against the inside edge, essentially impossible to get the belt to stay aligned with the rollers. Damned annoying."
5,Excellent tool,"I have owned a Bosch 1273D for 24 years.I finally wore out the base plate. It cost $13 to replace.This is an excellent tool.The newer model, 1276D, is almost identical and the two have many interchangeable parts."
2,Latches won't stay closed,"excellent durable and well made - the only weak point is poor design on the latches - even with the TSA approved padlocks, it has never arrived closed.If the latches were redesigned - this would be the bomb!"
1,pack mate bag,the bag is way to thin for its intended use it ripped the first time i went to use it a wast of money dont buy it
5,Great!,Great book that is very easy to read and I received it very quickly! I would reccommend this book to anyone!
1,WARNING: Don't Buy This Album!,"DON'T BUY THIS ALBUM!!!I bought this album just to get ""Fire"" by Arthur Brown. This was the only version of ""Fire"" I could find, Amazon forces the entire album down my throat to get just the ""album only"" track ""Fire"", and then I discover the ridiculous inclusion of some inane dialog in the last few seconds of the track. I've never even heard of this movie and now I have to suffer through some soundtrack producer's re-made version of Arthur Brown's hit song? Do they really believe this makes the song better? Who wants to hear movie dialog? If you want that, buy the movie on DVD.I believe that the sales of this album to people who only want ""Fire"" will exceed the profits of this movie. Good work boys, nice way to recoup the losses on this movie no one will remember years from now.Don't get played for a sucka like I did.DON'T BUY THIS ALBUM!!!"
4,"Good, but yes, the soundtrack voiceovers are a bit much....","Great songs, fun CD, and I guess I'm OK with the soundtrack voiceovers, but could do without them. I prefer what seems like the more popular practice of keeping all the songs ""clean,"" and then just hear things from the show on separate tracks or blended in just one montage mix."
5,"A Beautiful ""Day-in-the-life"" Character Study","""Judy Berlin"" is one of those tiny films you stumble upon and from which you come away with a whole new respect for acting, the power of good films and...hell...humanity! Everything about this film is small, and all the more powerful for its smallness: the setting, the plot, the time that passes, even the actors. This was made before Edie Falco (Judy) gained fame on ""The Sopranos"", so she doesn't project the over-confidence many stars do in little ""vanity"" projects. No, everyone here is real and pitch-perfect, especially the wonderful actress Madeline Kahn in her final role, filmed during her losing fight against ovarian cancer. If you have patience for films you won't find at your local movie theatre, and you appreciate real acting, ""Judy Berlin"" won't disappoint."
4,Good offbeat drama,"I read an interview with John Sayles recently where he noted that Edie Falco's performance in this film(not the SOPRANOS) is what made him decide to cast her in his new film SUNSHINE STATE. She really is quite good in this film. I just wanted to see more of her. The rest of the cast is also good-Barbara Barrie(BREAKING AWAY), Bob Dishy and Madeline Kahn. It's pretty easy to feel some Woody Allen influence here, but it's welcome. Eric Mendelsohn's short-THROUGH AND OPEN WINDOW is also included and I liked that too(stars Ben Stiller's mom Anne Meara)."
3,heart of darkness,"As a solar eclipse settles over the damaged, twilight Long Island town, the actors come out ... Ultimately, too much Jarmusch and Kafka for my taste, in the moody vein of ""Rumble Fish,"" ""The Last Picture Show"" and certainly ""Twin Peaks,"" ""Judy Berlin"" is a booby-trapped platform of complex emotions and pregnant concepts only the best actors can navigate. And watching Madeline Kahn like a lost goddess floating through dead suburban space is breathtaking. Her comedy was riotous and golden, but why didn't more directors recognize her depth? This is an unforgettable turn. Edie Falco, too, is heroically vibrant in the face of the somnombulism of the rest of the cast. Hers is the only character you would want to see again in another movie. And that's the thing with ""Judy Berlin;"" smart people put together this elegy. It's just too much character observation and not enough movie."
3,Jersey Too Small,"The jersey was sent on time and in good condition, but it was small. I ordered a Large and the tag said large, but this type of jersey or jerseys by this company must run small. It would have been nice to know that before ordering."
5,Bosch 4 1/2 inch angle grinder,"Just spent the afternoon grinding rust off the truck. Using the Bosch angle grinder made the job a joy. Light, compact, powerful. Easy to use in all positions and in hard to reach areas. From now on my 2 Milwaukee body grinders will go on sale. They are too clumsy and heavy AND DANGEROUS. With the Bosch sparks are controlled by a shield. Just the right size to grab by the body one-handed or by using the extra handle 2 hands can be used. I heard about German engineering but this is the first time that I enjoyed it. A GREAT TOOL."
4,"Great grinder, Guard needs work.","I appreciate the thought that went into making the guard ""adjustable"", but it fails in application. The bolt has to be almost falling out for it to move, it doesn't move throughout its full range of motion, and tho I like the idea of incorporating the spanner and the allen key into the same tool, it's terribly awkward to use the way it's made.The grinder is great. But the guard is what makes guards get taken off and thrown away."
3,good but with reservations,The grinder is a handy size and is powerful the grinding blade lasts very well but the gearbox makes an intermittent screaming noise that can't be good for longevity.
4,Great Tool,"Definetly not a tool for a novice, but it works great and with the appropriate blades cuts through tile and brick like it was butter."
2,Not impressed,I am disappointed by these bosch angle grinders. I bought one and within a few months the switch needed replacing.
3,Very basic 2nd grade work,"I bought this as summer work for my son, who is going into 2nd grade. This is a very basic phonic work book, with simple blends. As a review work it was ok, but it didn't cover all of his first grade phonic lessons. If your child is a good reader, or reading at 2nd grade level, this book is not very challenging."
5,My daughter wore it during the FIFA World Cup 2006,I bought this outfit for my then 2-month-old daughter when we watched the FIFA World Cup 2006 together (she most slept through it unless I yelled a goal). It was very comfortable for her.
3,a little disappionted,"Ony two songs of the nineteen listed were really noteworthy. I've enjoyed some of his past works most especially ""Triggers April March"", but sadly I found this outing was rather marginal."
1,Most annoying main character I've ever come across.,"I could not get into this book at all, having found myself feeling such a strong disliking for the main character 'Kit'. I didn't feel that I could connect with her personally, or even understand her. I was actually rooting for her to fail in the book so that I could feel a small victory against her. I usually stick to a book until the end, but I found her so frustrating that I had to delete it from my kindle. It is a well written book, but when you don't like the main character it outweighs any pros."
1,My Man Pendelton,Totally agree with Miss.G review. hated Kit character. how anyone could love her is beyond me. Glad it was free. Certainly not a keeper! had a difficult time finishing it. Sorry Ms. Beverly.B. Boyle/CA
2,My Man Pendleton,"I was totally disappointed with this book, it was free, but it was not funny, witty or any of the other words used to describe it. I read about 3 or more chapters of the book, and kept waiting for it to get interesting. Never did. Too many words describing things happening in the book, and not enough to keep up the interest in it."
3,Cute Book,"This was a fun book. It had much more substance to it than your typical romance novel. The characters and storyline were fun. Basically it is about a girl who has to get married within a certain timeline, or the whole family loses their 99.4 million dollars. Hilarity ensues because the girl doesn't want to get married, and her dad (who is the only real turd in the whole book) keeps trying to set her up. There is serious stuff in the book too - but overall a fun read."
4,Good afternoon read,"This is a sweet little love story written with a lot of humor. The ending is a bit predictable, but it is a great read for a rainy day or a lounge on the beach. I would be inclined to look for other titles from this author."
2,Not for me,I download a lot of free books and this is one I'm really happy I didn't pay for. I skipped ahead to the end because I found it boring and I even liked the secondary story line better than the main one.
5,witty!,"I throughly enjoyed reading this book. The lead characters make you laugh almost the entire length of this novel. This book is absolutely refreshing. This is the kind of novel that makes you upset when someone calls you while you are reading it. If you have to chose between books, this is the one. What a fabulous read."
2,A disappointment - both writing and from a technical viewpoint,"I had extreme technical issues with the book - skipping pages, going to the end of the book when trying to get to the next page, and freezing. All of this hassle I would have forgiven if it had been well written. While the premise was interesting, I found the characters to be flat, one-dimensional. It was impossible to warm up to the two main characters - Kit in particular seems to be a spoiled, self-centred brat. About 25% through the book, when it crashed again, I gave up. It just wasn't worth the trouble to read further about someone I couldn't admire or care for."
2,Very unlikable leading lady,"Although the romance and the leading man are great, the leading lady left so much to be desired. What a dysfunctional family! The ending was extremely rushed and insensitive."
1,WASTE OF TIME,"Seriously, it was bad. Don't waste your time. It was like a bad made-for-TV-movie. There is 2 storylines going on. One is Kit, who has to get married in order to save the family fortune, and then we have her brother who is a recovered alcoholic. The way Elizabeth Bevarly portrays a recovering alcoholic is completely ridiculous and inaccurate, (she must have never met one). Her brother is in love with Faith Ivory, who he has only seen once and is just enamored with her. I really didn't even want to write 20 words for this review because it was so bad. but i have to for amazon to let me post it. i have to warn others, DONT WASTE YOUR TIME."
2,cliche doesn't really cover it...,"ok -- I admit I'm not a chick-lit or rom-com type, but I'd just read three great but very heavy-going books in a row. So I read the reviews of this I decided to take a chance. And...I'm glad it was pretty cheap. From the very first few pages you know exactly how this will turn out. The writing is pretty cliche as well, and sometimes irritatingly 'knowing'. There are better choices if you want a little escapism!! Would not recommend."
4,My Man Pendleton,I enjoyed this book. It kept my interest. I would like to see another book to follow the other brothers & rest of the family.
3,okay,"I gave this book three stars because although there were some funny spots in it, there was nothing about this book that really grabbed my attention. I didn't love the main characters, especially the female main character and I really didn't have much emotion one way or the other by the time I was finished reading. This wasn't a bad book, I just felt it could have been better developed and after finishing I just didn't feel like it fulfilled my desire to read a good romance. Not bad, not great...neutral I think."
3,Strange title,"I don't understand why the title of the book was chosen as Pendleton does not seem like a ""full"" character in the book.The whole Pendleton referral all the time is strange."
1,Not Worth Reading,"Very disapointing book, despite the overall positive reviews. Although if you look closely, quite a few of other reviewers share my opinion. Female main character is nothing more than a spoiled brat. I couldn't stand her immature behavior and Pendelton's character was very one dimensional and dull. Disliked both characters so much that I couldn't finish the book."
3,simple story,"I should say I enjoyed this one. But it couldn't arose deep feeling in me. I couldn't connect with characters, although everything was in there perfectly explained."
5,LOVE it,"Love this ty, Perfect gift to show your love with a little heart on his chest. Not a collector but perfect for anyone collector or not its a cute bear."
2,Body Fat Monitor doesn't work well,"After losing 25 lbs the body fat monitor has hardly budged at 39%. Other tests show that I'm 26%. That is a huge difference!!! I don't know what the deal is with that. I know some people say that these type of monitors don't work well for women, but if this is the case they should call them ""Body Fat Monitor and Scale for MEN"". The scale portion of the Tanita, however, works great. Ladies, if you are looking for a body fat monitor, save your money. If [$$] isn't too much to shell out for a very accurate scale, then go for it."
1,Dont buy with Toys R US!!!,"Very awful thing of TRU/Amazon to do. Very misleading to the public to put in fine print that colors may very, but post pics of the invisible girl phasing. If thats the case, the post more pics of what may come. Or better yet, send what is picured and have each variation have a different order number. Like ""a"", ""b"", ""c""... something like that. I rated this as poor b/c that is what I think of TRU. I will NEvER, EVER, EVER, EVER shop with TRU online again. Spent the few extra bucks and shop online somewhere else, where you are sure to get what you pay for."
3,Deceptive picture!,"I haven't opened my box yet, because I'm a collector and do not plan to play with this. My intention is to display. However, to my horror, when I received this toy in the mail today, I found that the color scheme was COMPLETELY different.I received an all clear version of this character and I find that down right shady. If you're going to sell something, at least show the real picture!I'm aware of the disclaimer that says ""Colors may vary""; however, if the company knew they had different colors available, they should have included the pictures.I rated this toy at the halfway mark, because it's half of what I wanted."
1,Disappointment,This product was a total disappointment. I previously had the same product from what must have been another company because this item pailed in comparison. The scarf is so thin air goes straight through it. I have to wear earmuffs underneath the hood because it provides no protection from the wind. I am looking for a new hooded scarf of much better quality and a better price. This was a big ripoff.
3,"Cute, but cheaply made","This is a nice looking winter piece, but the fur is the cheapest quality (like dollar store stuffed animals), and isn't sewn really well. I'm keeping it because I have had trouble finding the style I want in stores, but I wish it were of better quality. Even the knit sweater part is constructed rather poorly."
1,Picture is deceiving...,"Extremely poor quality! It's so flimsy, I highly doubt this scarf would survive a wash. And since it's not made well, the fit is absolutely horrible. Also, they charge a whopping 15% restocking fee, so you'll only receive $16 for the $25 you spend plus you'll also have to pay for the return postage. I have no intention of ordering from Luxury Divas again nor will I recommend them to anyone I know."
3,Fine for some,"This item is fine if you like fake fur. I found the fur to be rough, so it was returned immediately."
1,CHEAP CHEAP CHEAP LOOKING!,This item looks nothing like the picture and is the lowest quality item I have ever purchased on amazon. It's not faux fur it's faux fabric - I also bought legwarmers from this seller that are just such a disappointment - avoid Luxury Divas as they are neither luxurious nor diva. Their name should be dollar store diva.
2,Does not look like picture,"Materials is very think. I will probably return this product. It is not very warm, either. May be okay in rain but not very cold weather."
3,Congenial Performers in Mildly Amusing Comedy,"Dudley Moore and James Coco are pleasant, often quite gifted, performers. So, too, are the assorted cameo players. The movie was pleasant, rarely funny, rarely boring. If you really do not want to cope, if you are a little down and want only a little relief without the strain of concentration, this might be for you. The gag situation are mostly predictable but have none of the reach into tasteless laughs or successful hilarity of Mel Brooks similar effort. Its a safe sort of vehicle made for actors who have all done a lot better."
3,Wholly Moses!,A classic Dudley Moore movie in a Biblical comedy. A cameo appearance from Richard Pryor.
4,As silly as I remembered,"I had not seen this movie since it came out in 1980. It was as slapstick hilarious as I remembered. What I had forgotten was the outstanding cast of actors: Richard Pryor, John Ritter, etc.Better story line than 'Blazing Saddles'."
2,technically well-written but seem to lack soul,"Although I personally did not like the movie, it is difficult for me point out why. There are few funny scenes, and most acting is very good, At first, I thought the movies seem fragmented but the movie's segues between scene seem well written and the scenes all seemed necessary to setup other scenes in the movie. Still, it lacks something as a whole. Key parts of the movies seem predictable and it lack something that would make it worth watching."
1,boring,"I thought with names likes Richard Pryor, Dudley Moore, John Ritter, it would be a good satire on the bible. Turned out to be a Dudley Moore ripoff. The script is sub-standard. Does anyone want to buy my copy?"
4,well worth the effort,"Some might think that the title of this book is misleading. It is a later work and on a par with ""the sea, the sea"" and ""the green knight"". Many of her books have to do with relationships that change dramatically when a major character changes. ""The Unicorn"" is probably the book where this is the most obvious but ""the message to the planet"" develops this theme in a much more complex way. Also, in many of her books lots of people die. In some cases it's simply to hard to believe the casuality rate. It isn't the case in ""the message to the planet"". The book is a great example of Iris Murdoch at her best."
5,Easy recipes and colorful descriptions,"These sausage recipes gather dishes from across the country, providing a treatise on different kinds of sausages and regional variations. Recipes blend with Aidell's travels across America in search of great sausages, providing a wide range of sausages and ethnic insights. No color photos, but the easy recipes and colorful descriptions don't need them."
3,"Looks Pretty, Tastes Bland","I have used this cookbook now for six months or so. The book looks very nice and has some good pointers on grinding, making and stuffing sausage. I have tried a number of the fresh sausage recipes (mostly pork). The breakfast sausage recipe is really pretty good, although probably too hot for your average breakfast palatte (and I like hot food, works great for gravy though). A number of the other sausage recipes seem very bland (especially the Italian recipes, both sweet and hot). I was actually pretty amazed by this in that Aidell's is a premium brand of sausage."
2,"encyclopedic, but not a good first book on the subject","This is a long and detailed book. I picked it up with another volume (Kobler's ""Making Great Sausage"") an thought Aidells' book was the less useful of the two."
4,Transformer,I bought and never actually installed this product. I'm sure it works fine and it looks like a good piece of equipment.
4,would've given it 5 stars if it had an accompanying book with it,"I would've given it 5 stars if it had an accompanying book with it, a book containing the pinyin spelling and Chinese characters of the words, phrases, and sentences contained in the auido CDs. But in addition to Mandarin language books, this program is great coz it'll really teach you how to correctly pronounce Chinese words and the native speakers repeat the learned words in such a way that it'll really stick to your head without boring you. The Pimsleur program has 30 lessons for each level and all 30 lessons are integrated in such a way that past learnings are still incorporated in the new lessons, that way you won't forget what you've learned even while you learn new stuff. This program is worth your money."
4,Good program,Good product. Needs an additional visual learning method. Great for learning during your commute.
3,A good supplement,"This audiobook series is a very good supplement to formal Chinese lessons. It is a good way to learn the basics of Chinese pronunciation and Chinese phrases. However, it is lacking in more in-depth exploration into Chinese, which is understandable. It only teaches Beijing Dialect because Beijing Dialect is the official language of China, but there are over 50 different dialects of Chinese and a lot of them are so different they are practically two separate languages.I would definitely recommend this to students who are already taking a Chinese course and want to do some more work outside of class. If you are serious about wanting to learn Chinese, however, this tool alone won't cut it."
1,One star is too high!!!,"I suggest if you wish to learn Chinese that you buy a different product.Perhaps not all of us learn using the same methods but I am a visual learner and every language I have learned has been through that method. Seeing the foreign word or sentence and hearing it pronunced correctly.This product has no visual contents, it is all audio. I can not learn any Chinese using this method.The advertising on this product is totally disceptive, if not criminal. It should clearly state, ""NO WORDS, NO VISUAL CONTENTS"".This is the sorriest language product I have ever bought."
5,The best!,"I went through Mandarin I in about a month. It was excellent! Using the Pimsleur memory technique on these CDs works great, I am not sure why so many reviewers say they need to make extra flash cards. I remember all of the Mandarin words effortlessly, but I did have to take a few lessons (especially the first few) over twice. Hands down the best and easiest way to learn Mandarin. I highly recommend doing each lesson completely without any interruptions and make sure your CD player has a ""pause"" button, preferrably with a remote, since they typically ask you to translate phrases and the time allotted was usually not enough for me do the full correct translation."
4,"it was fun to learn, but am I the only one that wonders about the choice of content?","I listened to the first 8 discs and learned about 70 words, but I found it helped to go against the instruction of Pimsleur and write out what I heard. I only did so after listening to each lesson at least twice or so.I found it effective (although I haven't tested it on anyone who speaks it) and enjoyed learning some basics, but have suspicions on what they assume the listener would like to learn. I will put in a direct quote from unit 8 and you can draw your own conclusion. From the beginning of lesson 1 it tells you frequently to imagine you have met a young woman on the street, and this continues that premise.Woman: I would like to drink some beer.Man: I too would like to.M: what would you like to do?W: I would like to drink something.M: where would you like to go to drink something? To my place?W: I would not like to go to your place. To the hotel.Pimsleur, I would rather not learn how to say such things."
4,Excellent for the spoken language,"Once again Pimsleur offers an excellent course for the spoken language with relevent conversations and a teaching style that is both automatic and effective. Users should realize that spoken and written Mandarin are different and this course is ONLY for the spoken language. However, it is excellent for listening and speaking. The speakers in the series are clear and easy to understand. My only objection to this course is the lack of written material to accompany it (though the booklet that does come with it is very intersting and informative). Unfortunately, much of Mandarin sounds alike and most 'words' have multiple meanings depending on tone, accompanying words and context. A pinyin or other phonetic guide to the conversations would be very helpful. But for those with a good ear who want to learn by listening and speaking, this course is excellent."
2,Disappointment with child sewing machine,"This sewing machine is not appropriate for kids under 13, because it doesn't work very well by the foot pedal and when just using the on button, you must be ready to sew. I was also very disappointed that the instructions to the machine was printed in German only. Adult supervision required at all times."
5,Typical Bosch Quality,"I checked them all prior to making a purchase. The pricewas a bit excessive, but this was a clear choice and the quality is unrivaled. The switch does take a little getting used to, but not a big deal."
3,Nicholas Eggenhofer...,"I acquired this book sometime around 1960. The story is pretty much standard stuff for a boy's adventure book of the times but the real star here are the illustrations by Nicholas Eggenhofer, probably the most underrated and unappreciated illustrator of Western art in America. Top notch art work."
1,No base at all,Stay away from this garbage. the sound quality is so bad there is no base at all!! the design (retractable) is appealing but you use it to listen to music. the sound is totally flat. I can get better sound quality buying one from a dollar store.if there is a way to give it no star I would have done that.
5,Love Audio Books,"I have just started listening to audio books.I love them,sure makes house cleaning go a lot faster."
3,Incomplete story,What was written on this story line was well written. The story moves along nicely without dragging. My concern is that it is part of a series with some story lines left incomplete--very disappointing.
5,This should be a series on Liftetime or the Hallmark Channel,"With each book I become more and more caputured by the people of Cedar Cove. I could so see this series become a TV series on the Lifetime Channel or Hallmark Channel. Macomber's character's are so well written, you know them like real life people."
5,One more time,Debbie Macomber has a town full of interesting people and keepsthe mystery going from family to family in Cedar Cove. Where thisbook ends the next will pick up and I can't wait to see who setthe fire and which family is featured!
4,I enjoyed the book,"I enjoyed the first part of the book at story development, however somewhere in the middle it became somewhat too unreal. The women were portrayed too bull-headed and men were lacking common sense and reasonable judgement. Just how fast they came to resolve all their differences (almost if the blink of an eye - in span of one conversation) just does not make it real at all. I have enjoyed most of Fern's books but this one happy ending felt just uncharacteristic of her writing. It felt as if she was under the gun to write this book and did not get a chance to edit it.This is just my humble opinion on this book."
2,Disappointed,"I have always loved books by Debbie Macomber, but this one is the exception. It seemed forced and disjointed--would not recommend at all...maybe this series should come to an end."
4,I always enjoy Debbie Macomber's stories!,I had most of November off & read several of the Cedar Cove series books. I loved the escape & the 'friends' it gave me.
5,Each book in series is great,"Love the the new characters and following the lives of the originals. There is laughter, love, breakups, tragic breakups.Read it!!"
3,50 Harbor Street,"Told in a rambling, multi faceted style, this story will catch readers up on what's been happening in Cedar Cove since last they visited. Corrie McAffee's joy at having her daughter home is a bit marred by the fact that she and her husband, the town's sole PI, are being harrassed by an anonymous stalker. That does not keep her from trying to match Linette up at a dog and bachleor auction. However, Linette is not all that delighted with the bachleor she receives. She'd rather have gotten a puppy than Cal, but Cal has a few surprises. Meanwhile, Cal's boss, Cliff's off and on romance with Grace Sherman is back to being on as Grace exorcises the demons in her memory.*** Dedicated fans will not want to miss this chance to reunite with old friends. Ms. Macomber's trademark warmth and affection for her characters shines through to touch every reader's heart. ***Reviewed by Amanda Killgore, Freelance Reviewer."
1,Explaining the self-explanatory,"Warren Buffett's sayings are funny, profound, and self-explanatory. This book quotes 125 of those sayings, following each with a brief, humorless ""interpretation,"" which, at best, adds nothing to the original, and in some cases misses the whole point.For a better sense of how this great investor thinks, read any of the recent annual reports of Berkshire Hathaway."
3,Helpful to the amateur trader,"In a day and age where one can easily and inexpensively manage a portfolio and trade on the stock market, this book provides helpful insights into the difference between investing and speculating. I hope consequently to be more prudent in the choice of my investments. In particular there is strong warning against the speculative type of investment in companies that are full of hopes but short on a solid track record.Significant in this is Buffets avoidance of technology stocks."
2,we've heard it all before,I read this book in about 2 hours. It's primary message is what we've all heard before from Buffett:Know what you're buying intoPlan for the long haulWait until the good company is priced lowThere's a bunch of other information but those are the 3 primary messages in the book (from my perspective).
2,Only a few gems among the obvious,"I was hesitant to order this book based on the negative reviews, and now I understand why. I will grant that there are a few gems of business philosophy among the quotations, but the accompanying explanations are often childish, and the ideas themselves become very repetitive about two-thirds of the way through. You will get tired of hearing to buy genuine value when it's cheap, trust me. You will get tired of the hyperbole as well, along the lines of ""follow this advice and you'll be a billionaire!""I bought the Kindle edition, and it's rather expensive as Kindle books go. Oddly enough, the book is the opposite of what it preaches: mediocre value at a high price.I would recommend you search the web for quotes from Buffett and do your own interpretation of their meaning. You may not get the full history as conveyed in the notes in this book, but you'll get the gist and that's really what matters here."
3,Interesting enough; no earth shattering epiphanies here,"My husband & I take a lot of road trips, and listen to audio books to pass the time. This one was interesting enough, although somewhat repetitive. No earth shattering info, but funny at times."
4,"good, but repetitive","definitely worth the quick read, but also definitely repetitious in parts. there's really some fundamental things warren does and believes in and could probably be summed up in about 10 pages. having said that, it still nice to see how he applies his system in different contexts.warren has a bunch of different shorter books out. i haven't read them all, but what i have read, i really think there could be one comprehensive book that includes his overall philosophies on life and investing."
4,Insightful.,"I picked up this book because I was curious what one of the greatest investors of this era thinks about (especially when it comes to stock investing). Definitely a good read. A lot of the wise sayings are commonsense, but it doesn't hurt to be reminded. I would say that the Core theme for investing in this book is value investing and why it works."
4,Great piece of book for a casual read,Some great advice overall for life in general and investment in particular. I liked the style of the book - its not a giant essay but is composed of bunch of short quotes and thoughts.
5,To the point..,I purchased this book as a Christmas present for my boyfriend. This was a great buy because the book is to the point. For readers that want their info in one paragraph and not over several chapters - this is the book for them.
3,Where's the 4 hours of extra footage?,"Really enjoyed this movie, but since it's going to be on Public Television in HiDef for free 10/21/11, why should I buy the lower-quality DVD version...? Because we were promised 4 hours of extra footage, good reason! But this release description says only 29 minutes of extra footage. Hopefully, the description is wrong. Or, the 4-hour version is a different, higher-priced product (how could PJ do that to us haha?)Also, would like to see the BluRay because the newly-shot footage is HD quality.... hate to see it printed-down!--Gary"
1,Bleh on the single disc version,"Wow, so this is just the movie itself and NO extras at all??? There is no point in buying the single disc, no-extra version, and now they are sold out of the deluxe sets. The deluxe sets will probably run $1000 on E-Bay..."
1,Pearl Jam have sold out,"The deluxe edition is out of print and won't be reprinted, so if you're a fan and couldn't make it to the ten club in time, Pearl Jam wants you to know that YOU DON'T MATTER ANYMORE.Also, this Blu-ray doesn't come out until after Xmas because it's a best buy exclusive. It's sickening to see a band like Pearl Jam stoop so damn low."
4,question,i haven't bought this YET because...is it really in italian like the description says? i saw this in theaters and it was in english of course. i have a hard time believing this dvd is in italian but i don't want any unpleasant surprises.
1,"bad product, worse customer support","I bought one of these a year or so ago, and 1 of the 3 discs I bought didn't work right out of the box. The drive itself lasted about 3 months before it broke completely. I've been calling orb constantly ever since trying to get them to replace the drive (under its warranty), and have finally resorted to writing them letting them know I'm contacting my lawyer. Luckily, I had a friend who had an orb drive of his own, so I was able to get my data off of the discs that did work.Don't be fooled like I was by these people."
2,Buggy Software Hurts Good Hardware,"I've been using a SCSI Orb on both PC and Mac, and have spoken to a PC USB Orb user. The USB on Win98 seems to be the worst, causing problems with Windows Explorer and crashes, and SCSI on Win98 couldn't reformat a disk using Castlewood's software. (FDISK worked, God only knows why...) SCSI on Mac is only usable now that 3rd parties have come out with drivers for Orb, and Castlewood has licensed a good tools program.Microsoft takes a lot of flak for Windows being buggy, but the biggest source of problems is badly written drivers. This time it's not Bill's fault."
4,"Decent product, has some flaws, but worked well!","I used this drive for 5 years and it only broke on me once. ORB technology is much faster, and way superior to the lame slow CD-R, and DVD-R formats. ORB disks are as fast as hard drives, and are really quite nice. Unfortunately since CastleWood went out of business, and my new Mac lacks a SCSI port, I am having to sell this drive. I am skeptical whether the USB drive works in OSX Tiger, and even if it did 2.2GB is way too small to backup my 30GB hard drive.If CastleWood would make disks 30GB a piece, then I think they might still be in business. But frankly 2.2GB is dinky by todays standards.So thumbs up on the drive, and speed. But thumbs down on the size of the disks, and availability of the media, as ebay is practicially the only way to buy disks, for those that continue to use ORB drives."
3,Is that a stinger in my neck or are you just glad to see me!,"To set a fifth Doctor story in a Third Doctor time period would seem a risky move, but Mark Morris successfully achieves this landing the Doctor in the 70's alongside his UNIT pals whilst the other Doctor is off planet somewhere else. Mark has written this with 4 chapters (episodes???) which has the cliffhangers at the end and plays just like the tv series would. Although the book is very violent in some places, with alien hybrids massacring nearly a whole town sending lots of blood and limbs flying. Characterisation is top notch from the Doctor's portrayal, brash Tegan, cowardly and self preserving Turlough to Mike Yates, Benton and the (younger) Brigadier. Overall, a fun, easily read book. RECOMMENDED!!!!"
3,Imaginative design but not about leadership...,"...which is why I had purchased this book, that is, thinking it would have something to do with leadership. In this fictional, interactive account, a newly minted West Point Lt is given a rifle platoon and faces overwhelming odds against him. The reader makes choices throughout the book, usually about tactical decisions, which leads the reader down a ""decision field,"" usually to the reader's own demise. This is imaginative. However, the basic principles of leadership are not discussed, other than working together, making sound and timely decisions, maintaining positive communications, and so forth."
5,"Dynamic, engrossing, well presented","A must read for all military professionals, particularly those who aspire to combat command, it is also highly recommended to any civilian who wishes to better understand the modern U.S. Army. It gives deep insight into the soldiers and leaders of America's Army and the difficult and unique challenges that they face. Antal is a master of current doctrine and tactics and excels in his ability to teach these lessons to the reader. Above all he is a gifted storyteller; you will be more than merely engrossed in this life and death tale, you will live it as you participate in this interactive drama."
2,Not relevant in post-Iraqi Freedom world.,"As a former Light Infantry soldier in the US Army who doubled as an Anti-Tank weapons operator, I bought this book to see if what I learned held water. In this book, I was shocked at how little flexibility the scenarios offered. Life, including Army life, is about small decisions. This book only emphasizes big decisions. A quote I read once said ""Life is what happens when you are making big plans."" In this book, that is all that needs to be remembered. The commander you play in this war game is a West Point graduate, and a graduate of several Army schools, including the Rangers. To paint him as a newbie is a real stretch, especially when dealing with an incumbent and overbearing platoon sergeant. The United States is played as a continually unprepared military power and the enemy is made out to be on steroids. This book is almost irrelevant post-Iraqi Freedom. Save your money and buy a David Hackworth book instead."
2,Very hard to learn tactics,"I felt the book was very hard to pull lessons from. The book format has you making choices about tactical situations but when there is a good or poor outcome, there is very little information about why your decision and the outcome was good or poor.There are also many times where the author just asks you to roll dice to determine your fate which leaves you wondering what the lesson is.Worst of all, there is no chapter in the book that has a summary of the tactical situation or situations and actually teaches you how to review the tactical situation like a training soldier would.All in all, you can barely learn any tactics unless you are willing to make an investment of many hours reading the book multiple times to try to extract information in very small pieces."
1,Too Bulky,"The motor housing/handle of this grinder is too big to be comfortable. Holding it for hours gets old! The switch was constantly clogging up. I used it for stone carving, which is dusty however other grinders have held up fine."
2,Had high hopes for this.,This does not tighten anywhere close to fitting the dovetails on a rifle. I assume if a rail is installed it will fit the rail. This item was returned. If you know this will work for you the quality is good.
5,7 secrets,"I highly recommend this book for women wanting to build a closer relationship with God and themselves. This book offered eye opening points that are happening in my life at this particular time. The information Mrs. Wilson offers can be used by any women in any stage of your life I have passed it on to someone else so that they to can be blessed and helped. Also, this book is a keeper and can be reflected back upon at any given time when the secrets needs to be refreshed."
5,7 Secrets,"I would definitely recommend this book to any single or married woman if they are looking to have a closer relationship with our Lord and Savior. I have most of PB Wilson's books and I have enjoyed and loved each and everyone of them. She is a very down to earth author who knows just how to relate to women's inner selves. She is one of my very favorite authors...along with Joyce Meyer. Their books are completely different styles of books, but each of them has their own God given talent in knowing just what to say at just the right time. I greatly admire and thank both of these wonderful Christian women for all the inspiration they have given to me."
5,I didn't think I would like this,Sad story of crime but shows a brother's love. Shuh ruhk Kahn was very young in this movie and his comedyand romantic actions were in full bloom
4,Graphic novel written and illustrated by Eric Shanower,"Join Dorothy, the Scarecrow, the Cowardly Lion, and Eureka the talking cat as they set off for adventure in search of the rare Quipperug. Meet Knotboy, the magical living toy, made entirely out of wood. Journey to the fabulous Secret Island floating inside a mysterious mountain that could only exist in the wondrous world of OZ! An illustrated expedition to Oz. On glossy paper (colored illustrations)"
5,A Classic Oz Adventure - Don't Miss It!,"This is an outstanding book in the classic Oz style with Dorothy, the Cowardly Lion and the Scarecrow going on an adventure. Along the way they meet Knot Boy, a living doll made of wood, and Princess Trinkarinkarina, who feels she has outgrown her childhood friend/toy. Of course there is excitement and danger as they explore under, over and through the Secret Island of Oz. Eric Shanower is at his best in the delightful and outstanding drawings, beautifully colored, that bring this graphic novel to life. A lasting treasure that never gets boring."
3,shoegazing kinda okayness,"some of the miasmic guitar flourishes are going to surprise you pleasantly here--put you in mind of my bloody valentine, to whom this band owe a considerable debt, especially on the single.Annie's lyrics are indeed juvenile--but as she not really in the singer/songwriter category, who cares all that much about lyrics anyway? as far as songwriting goes, there are a few fuzzy/pretty bands on the LA scene who do this MUCH better: the black watch (check out ""the innercity garden EP"") or MARJORIE FAIR..."
5,Whooo-hooooo!!! Giant Drag is no drag!! I'm so clever!!,"I just bought this so I could hear Annie say bad words. It's the same reason I bought Liz Phair about a jillion years ago. Nice, little rock and roll songs. They have a personality, which is more than I can say about most bands today. By the way, does anyone know Anne McCorkle? I think her name is now Anne Ward. Man, I sure liked her. I spent 4 days with her in the Spring of 1995. I still think about her. Should I just move on with my life? If you know her, ask her to call Chris. Thank you. Giant Drag, Giant Drag, Giant Drag!!"
5,Ahhhhhhhhhhh,"That's the reaction I've had when I listened to this the first time and the second and, basically, since I bought it. It's really good and tries to be as diverse as it can be with the young spirit that comes across so well. The shoegazing songs are delightfully loud and not as druggy as some of the other shoegazing that's out there, although I like that too (without the drugs being taken myself). What I like most about this album are those surprises that come up like at the end of smashing where follows her number with some unrelated cack. It just adds a personal and freewheeling feel to the music that's nice to have and brings charm to material that's considered to be more about atmosphere than personality, I like it, I really like it."
5,like ghostriding a bicycle into a nursing home.,old people sort of smell weird sometimes but if you love your grandmother like i do than you know she will be a better cook then you could ever be. man that was a good cookie i ate for breakfast. oh yeah also while i ate it i was listening to this awesome cd and crying. except for the crying part. hey don't make fun of me okay.
5,Excellent... get the best drops of tea into your cup!,"I looked the world over for this item, and only found it here! Thanks, Amazon. Perfect for squeezing the tea bag."
4,Probably Accurate,"My assessment is positive.Several signs point to good accuracy. Wight readings are always spot-on identical with those of my physician's scale (the balance beam device that's supposedly ultra-accurate). Bodyfat readings are always consistent when my bodyweight is unchanged. Also, bodyfat readings steadily decreased, during a period when my weight was also steadily decreasing. That's what would be expected of a device that was accurate.An improvement would be readings that were backlit. Self-measurements are best done early in the early morning, when light is low. Appearance is a bit clunky, but that's no big deal. Probably like most people, I keep my scale hidden underneath the bed anyway."
1,Slimy!,Bought a bag of these from the local supermarket. Horrible things. I've had many dried plum brands and these were so intensely slimy that the thick sludge left on my fingers and roof of my mouth grossed me out and now the bag now sits in my pantry. Bleh. :(
4,Grasshopper holds his own.,"I say this knowing that basically every member of Mercury Rev is pressent on this album in some respect. Without making this entire review a comment on how this sounds like Mercury Rev, it does mix the chaotic noise of Yerself Is Steem and the focused beauty of See You On the Other Side.There is some interesting and unexpected use of electronics on this album, such as ""Univac Bug Track"" which features a lo-fi jungle beat along with the distant plucks of a string section looped, sometimes coming close to videogame soundtrack territory if it weren't so gorgeously muddy. The first track, ""Silver Balloons"" also has a familiar breakbeat and some nice Spacemen 3 styled guitars and vocals.Still, with all of the experimentation he can muster up, the best tracks are the drugged out ballads (The Ballad of the One Eyed Angelfish, NY Avenue Playground) which sit nicely amongst the freakishly diverse structure of The Orbit of Eternal Grace."
2,dissatisfied,"Despite being a second-hand product, I think you should take care of sending a new CD box as it has been sent in bad conditions, more specifically, broken."
4,Great singer!,"I watched a video on YouTube and fell in love with Scott Krippayne's song ""I'm not cool"". That one and ""My everything"" are the best, in my opinion, because they're so cheerful and different. The CD is worth buying just for those. I also like ""Tell it like it is"" and ""Deeper still"". The other songs are alright; I usually skip them, but they are nice to have and just relax sometimes."
4,"Finally, some explanation of why and how","I was searching for a book to explain things to me about the Romanian language. This one does. Yes, I needed the drill and vocabulary but I also needed some explanation of why the various phrases meant what they did. The authors have given these explanations in addition to the standard elements of language instruction. As someone who has studied language before I found this book to be a great way for me to associate the Romanian language with the other language elements I already know."
5,There's Nothing Better!,"This video is a MUST for back pain sufferers. The exercises and background information are extremely effective in reducing or eliminating back pain. I've worn out two copies of the tape, because keeping up on the exercises keeps the pain from coming back.So what does it take to get more copies available????"
5,Rescued me from a life on prescription painkillers!,"When I stumbled upon this video more than 10 years ago, I was desperately seeking relief from the pain I had suffered for years from a laminectomy on the 5th lumbar disc. I was caught in the vicious grip of prescription painkillers. Although my surgeon was a good one, he didn't have a clue when it came to rehabilitation. Within 6 weeks of starting these exercises I was free of the painkillers! My strength and mobility are better today (age 48) than when I had the surgery (I celebrated my 30th birthday in the recovery room!). How disappointed I am that it is out of production. PLEASE re-release this video so others can benefit from it as I did."
5,Buy this video if you have back pain!!!,"I've been using this video for five years and my back has never been better. I had two surgeries for ruptured discs. After the second surgery I got this video and started doing the exercises. I wish someone had told me about it before my first surgery. The tape is divided into three exercise routines. They take 15, 20, and 30 minutes respectively and are for use when you are in pain (15 minutes), recovering from pain (20 minutes), or simply want to avoid pain (30 minutes). The exercises are not strenuous----in fact they are relaxing. However, if you are in pain, or your back feels weak, these exercises will relieve your pain. I checked in because I wanted to buy a copy for a friend and was disappointed they weren't making it anymore. Tell the publisher they are foolish!!! This tape is simply great!!!"
1,If I could I would give it 0,"I believe that I could have written this book and it would have had better spelling, and better grammar. I thought my eight year old brother wrote this book. Simple things like the misuse or spelling of their there and they're was abused. Some sentences did not even make since, or should I use it as the author would have cents. The story line was boring and hard to follow. Then that ending, come on man, it was so corny. This was the first book I read by this author, and Triple Crown, and I do not plan to read another.-A Bad Boy's Review"
2,garbage...str8 garbage,"I was so disapointed in this one. I've read quite a few triple crown books and loved them all but this one was by far the worst. First the book was extremely boring. 2nd, the story line was horrible. The plot against Clarence and Danny Boy was horrid. just overall horrible. save your money"
4,is there a part two,"for this to be his first title i enjoyed very much i wanted a little bit more in the end, thats why i was wondering if there was a part two. I also have stacy but from the reviews i havent read it because it seems no one likes it, i guess ill read that one when i have nothing else left."
2,No No No,This was not for me... giving it two stars is a stretch. I mean it was so boring. It took me two weeks to read this slowwww drawn out book. It couldn't even keep my attention. The last two chapters were the best so that's why I am giving it two stars. I will not be purchasing any more books from this author. I am glad I borrowed this from a friend because I would have taken it back and requested a refund. I can't believe this was a Triple Crown Publication this is the first book I have read from them that I truly didn't like!! Don't get it no....
4,GREAT READ!!,"This book was very good, not your ordinary hip hop novel. The plot was original and the characters vivid and believeable."
1,Just Plain Bad,"This drill was my first hammer drill....P>I had it for about 2 years, maybe used it for 2 dozen times in that span. I used it to drill holes in bricks and concrete as well as to mix concrete. From start, the levers for switching speed and mode (drill vs. Hammer) was very hard to negotiate.Started noticing power decrease when I started mixing 2 lbs. of concrete mix in a 5 gallon bucket. Saw sparks internally to drill when I tried drilling 8 holes into concrete foundation. Finally went bezek on me the other day while drilling 1/2"" bit into brick. Drill got stuck in on mode, had to pull cord to shut off power.Do yourself a favor, save yourself some money. Stay away from this drill. It's just plain bad."
4,I Drill Safes and Vaults,"This is the drill i use. It really is only good for 1/4"" holes in masonry . Anything more than that go for an SDS drill. This drill spins at the perfect speed for penetrating hardned stainless and will meet your needs for any type of high speed drilling. I always have this drill on my truck . It id prone to overheat though if you bog it down at high speed so allow the bit to cut and the motor to spin."
1,Full of inconsistency and error,"This book is full of inconsistency and errors. The questions in the back frequently give different answers in different chapters. There are several statements in this book that are clear errors. All in all, get blueprints or something else. This book is not worth the money."
1,Serious Problem with Delivery (or lack thereof)!,"ABSOLUTELY NOT SATISFIED WITH SABRINA SILVER. This product was ordered on October 22, 2010 together with two other sellers. All the other shipment arrived within 7 days from the date of order. Only this one is still missing. When I asked them (Sabrina Silver) what happened, they just said that the shipment must be with the local customs here in Hong Kong. Mind you, I wasn't born yesterday. If the shipment is still with the local custom, how come all the other shipments (they were actually rings & accessories also) arrived so swiftly and NOT this one? To top it off, they charged my credit on October 23, 2010 already. Although this seller Sabrina Silver has quite an impressive track record in delivering their goods, my shipment is actually contrary to public belief. Case still not resolved at this time."
5,For my mom.,"I gave this ring to my mom because she loves geckos, and she Absolutely loves it. It is beautiful I'm even shopping for one for myself."
4,Jackie Gleason and Steve McQueen together,"While neither Jackie Gleason nor Steve McQueen's best movie this one is one of my favorites. Steve McQueen is not his usual cool self. He's in the Army and counting the days until he's out. He's got bigger things on his mind once he's discharged. He spends his time learning from Jackie Gleason. Jackie Gleason is a Supply Sergeant and has an angle on everything. This was written by William Goldman, the same man who brought us The Princess Bride, but totally different. If you're interested in a different Steve McQueen, this is for you. While a bit pricy I was glad the DVD played on our DVD player and was thrilled with how fast it was delivered and the condition it arrived."
4,"""Brilliant rarely seen gem from 1963"".","""I remember seeing ""Soldier in the Rain"" on our local independentstation WOR-TV in the 1970's. I've never forgotten it.Brilliantly mixing comedy with poignant drama, it featuresterrific performances from Jackie Gleason and Steve McQueen.Gleason has never been better as the army lifer Lt. Maxwell Slaughter and McQueen is excellent as his sidekick Eustice Clay.Tuesday Weld contributes a nice turn in a supporting role.If you ever get the opportunity to see this rarely shown film,don't miss it. ""Until that time Eustice. Until that time"".Joseph BertieWoodside, N.Y"
5,one of the greats,"Wonderful movie , I remember seeing it when I was maybe 8 years old and haven't seen it since so Is tought I would give it a try and I am glad I did"
1,Way over price avaialble elsewhere,"I think this is a DVD-r made when you order the item. Not sure. but in any event, an originsl disk can be gotten from Warner Bros (wbshop) for about half the price."
1,FAILURE,"I ordered this tape on AUG 5, on AUG 29 I e-mailed the seller and asked if it was shipped yet. I have recieved neither a REPLY nor THE TAPE. I respectfully request my money be returned to my account so that I may purchase the tape ""Soldier in the Rain"" from someone else. Thank you.Frank Cosby"
5,Until that time Eustis...until that time...,"This is one of my favorite movies. The teaming of Gleason and McQueen plays quite well on screen, and who can ever forget Gleasons' mastery over the Coke machine and how he'd tether McQueens' wild schemes. There are other scenes, but the bar brawl near the end of the movie was one of the best staged (for the time especially) and McQueen actually hurt his ribs after being tossed thru the entry partition. It was very realistic and brutal. And, that flying drop-kick that McQueen puts on Ed Nelson. Hoo daddy, and I'm not even a wrasslin' fan, but that was something...it's a film that has a little something for everyone, and everyone should see this neat little gem..."
5,sweet memories,"I saw this film on the real screen. I thought it had to be in the '50s, but the Internet served me again.I can remember but one line or scene from this marvelous movie. Gleason is talking about retirement from the Army. McQueen is doing his thing. ""What do you want to do Sarge?""Gleason sighs, ""I want to go to an island where the young woman don't wear tops. I want all of them to have [...] that point up.""Yes to all of the other reviews. I can get this film on tape in excellent condition for only $[...]. Why bother? Didn't know that Henry did the music. Thanks!Jim HinksonEl Sobrante, CAjhinkson@aol.comI have no idea why this film came into my mind."
5,Soldiers'Heartfelt Masterpiece Needs a DVD Rendering,I saw this movie when I was in the United States Army. I loved it. Why the heck isn't this on DVD? McQueen and Gleason give heartfelt performances that mostly every ex-GI can deeply commiserate with their own experiences. It is a crying shame that this movie has not yet been rendered to the DVD medium. It is my sincere hope that Amazon will somehow alert the appropriate studio as to the emotion this evokes in many ex-servicemen; and elicit them to produce an anamorphic version of this wonderful story.
1,I've never seen a book with so many mistakes...,"This the worst of the worst studying material on the market. You guys should take this off your selling list. If you expect to take the TEA don't buy this book, because you will fail the test."
5,Farming the way it should be,"Written for broad audience of ""stakeholders"" in the food system, from consumers to ranchers, Imhoff has done a great job of highlighting farmers and ranchers who are working to protect the environment and sustain family farmers. These farmers and ranchers are inspirational examples, and show that agriculture doens't have to destroy the planet while it feeds us. Carra's photos offer an enticing complement that gives the book a coffee-table feel."
3,Blade change mechanism would have been a deal-breaker...,"...if I had read the reviews before I bought it. But I didn't. I went into Home Depot and looked at the demo model, liked the weight and balance, and bought it. I took me a few tries to get the blade in. It did come in and out more easily after a few times. It cuts nice, though. I replaced a 40 year old B&D promo model saw, when the switch finally went out. I should have just replaced the switch on the B&D."
3,Bosch 1587 avs,"the saw is a cut above most other brands, however, it has what I consider a major design flaw. the Blade release mechanism is on top of the saw, made from flimsy plastic, which needs to be turned several times to remove the blade, to tighten the blade it requires that you turn it in the other direction until it makes a noise and is hard to turn, it is only a matter of time before the mechanism fails. I passed my 1587 on, and would not purchase another."
1,Piece of crap,"I should have read the reviews here before buying it as a closeout. I used it for less than 2 hours, needed to change the blade and it no longer secures the blade.....no response from the pathetic Bosch Customer Service."
2,Wish I had not bought this,"From reading the good reviews this tool received, I thought the warnings of blade removal/insertion problems were probably from user lack of reading instructions or brute force. I am a woman with over 20 years experience with power tools, I read and follow instructions carefully, and I do not force things to their breaking point. However, after one use with this tool, instructions in hand (having been forewarned), I went to change the blade. Though I followed instructions to the letter, I couldn't get the blade out. Again and again I tried, not knowing what I was doing wrong. The top plastic piece then broke right off leaving me in the middle of a job with no tool to finish. This tool looks brand new; I had purchased it, used it once, then didn't need it again until after the store would take it back. They really messed up on this one. It doesn't matter how good it runs if you can't get a blade in and out."
1,Why bother?,"Unable to get drivers for any OS other than XP and earlier. Not even Vista. Of course, my Win 7 wouldn't even work since it could not find a driver that would accommodate it. Even going to their website was a bust. I'm sure it would work fine with Win 98 or 3.3. Anything newer than XP, forget it!"
1,they ship a different modem!,"If you are looking for the v90 version with the speakerphone connections - DO NOT ORDER THIS PRODUCT! Despite the fact that it is described as the v90 version, they are actually shipping the v92 version which does not have the speakerphone connections. And they charge you a fee after returning the product."
2,Incorrect Software,"The disk sent with the product states as follows when trying to load it:""Needs software that has passed Windows log testing to verify it is compatible with Windows XP""It also states that if I continue to load, it has the potential of crashing my PC - pls advise or I will be forced to return this item. Thank you."
5,Mother and daughter,"I borrowed this book from our local library for my 9-year old daughter because she likes to read poetry. She loved it. Then we read it together and I loved it. She now realizes that she is not the only one that gets grief from her mother about cleaning her room, having plenty to do when she's ""bored"", practicing the piano etc. I am going to buy this book for her and as a birthday gift for her friend. Every mother and daughter should own it."
2,"Dear Mother, Dear Daughter","The book was much shorter than I had expected. Also, I was looking for a book with responsive readings between the mother and daughter and that is not what this book is. Somewhat disappointed in the purchase."
5,Very metal indeed!,This is an awesome compilation for anyone who likes death metal! It contains both videos from bands I've known of for 20 years as well a several bands I've never heard of. I enjoy this DVD very much!
2,Too small for such big bucks,"My son has been asking me for a folder to hold his cards. He has over 100 cards and still buying. When I saw this, I was really excited to get him a personal notebook. I was expecting to see an 8X10 size notebook but instead I got this little 5X7 card case. It is not worth the money."
2,Not what I thought it would be,"I had been thinking about getting a treadmill when a late night infomercial for the Walkmill caught my eye. I liked the idea that it was supposed to be easily moved and, based on what they were doing in the informerical, it appeared to be programmable, so I decided to order it. I first received one that was broken and had to be exchanged. On the plus side, I did receive the replacement fairly quickly. However, it turned out this treadmill is not computerized - a huge disappointment. While you can vary the speed and incline, you have to make the adjustments as you walk, they can't be pre-programmed. As far as portability, while it is on wheels, it still takes some effort to move it from room to room and mine therefore stays put in one place. Overall not worth the price in my opinion."
2,very Christianese,"I could not finish the movie. The idea was okay but the execution was too oriented to the ""already Christians,"" and like so many insider stories, lacks a really critical review for quality. It assumes the Christian viewers will accept it simply because it is a Christian movie."
5,A versitile family game,"We got the kids PSX for Christmas, and my 11-yr.-old son insisted on Tony Hawk which he's played at friends' homes. After a few hours of watching, I asked him to show me, his 37-yr.-old mom, how to play...I was hooked! Although at first I wiped out more times than I was upright, I did get the hang of it rather quickly. It's a lot of fun to try all kinds of crazy tricks and not risk a broken neck. The two-player options allow you to compete head-to-head on a split screen, take turns trying to ""out trick"" each other in ""Horse,"" or just take turns. Compared to most video games, I don't consider this one to be violent. Just a few minor blood splattering and grunting when skaters crash. My nine-yr.-old daugher picked the game up quickly as well and I can already see that we are all going to be jostling for our turns on this fast-paced, always different game."
5,This game is awesome!,"Tony Hawk is an all around great game. I don't skateboard, but after hearing what a good gane it was, I decided to rent it. Wow! It took me about five or ten minutes to get the basic controls down. After that I was glued to the screen for about six hours! One of the reasons I found this game to be so great was the fact that once you have gotten all five tapes in a level, you find that there is so much more you can do. I'd think about taking up skateboarding but after seeing some of the spills in this game, I'm having second thoughts!"
4,Cool Game,"This game has many levels and tons of characters to go along with them. Tricks, tricks, and more tricks: that describes this game. Plenty and plenty of game play. If you love skateboarding, get this game."
3,my review,this game isnt exactly as good as people make it out to be. there is not a huge variety of tricks to do and there mostly vert tricks. this game shows no value to street skaters because most of the tricks that earn you big points are vert tricks. This game thought is fun. Its really easy and ideal for people that dont know anything about skateboarding. The pros are good and the board grpahics are cool to. But there are no up and coming skaters. i found it fun and easy but it also kind of brings you into a fantasy world of skateboarding where you there a ramps in malls and rails in area 51.
1,Don't Listen to the Other Reviews this Game is Outdated and Isn't that fun,"People saying this a perfect game are either skateboarders are just crazy. This game is so outdated graphics are horrible, gameplay is decent at best. there is no reason this should have higher then 3 stars and for that reason I am giving it a 1, so people will know it's not a 4 or 5 out of 5 star game."
3,THPS is ok.,Tony Hawks Pro Skater is a fun game.PROS:1)really fun2)levels are huge3)2 player mode good4)alot of tricks and specialsCONS:1)graphics are choppy2)characters are jaggy3)controls get difficult in small areas4)gameplay gets a little repedativeSo if you have a playstation and are looking for a good skating game don't go for Tony Hawks Pro Skater (go for the new ones). It was good for its time but is now old and out dated.
3,Sadly short...,"This game is very fun, while it lasts anyway. The graphics are great, the music is fantastic, the moves are cool, and the levels are cool too. But even though it can be a little challenging, the truth is, the game is just too short. The game is not enough of a challenge, there are only 30 tapes in 6 levels with three competitions, and the game takes no time to blaze through. Even though it is harder to combo, the game often gives you more points than it should. If you're just going after three gold medals, a person could beat this game with two different characters in a day. If you're going for all the tapes, it depends on the person. Maybe a day, maybe two. There isn't much depth to a lot of the gameplay, and it gets old really quick. The length of the game and how easy it is cut two stars off the game's rating. The game had more potential than the hype and what it really was, but for now, and even in the second, it's not much..."
4,THE BEST SKATEBOARDING GAME EVER!,"This game is sweet! Pro Skater is really addicting. Once you start you cant stop playing. The sound is top notch. Although the music gets annoying after a while, it does have some cool songs. The sound effects are also good. My only complaint about the sound is when skaters fall they say ouch and grunts. But in real life they would yell and scream. I give the sound a 9.0. The graphics are decent but not perfect. There are some glitches in the game but nothing to worry about. Other then that the graphics are superb. With gorgeous courses and sweet player models. The game also lacks colors but who cares. I give the graphics a 8.5. The gameplay is excellent. Cool combos and tricks. Although the camera gets annoying sometimes. I give the gameplay a 9.5. This game is a must have."
5,The tightest game,This game is tight. It is a whole lot better than thrasher. It is probably the best game for Playstation along with Driver.
5,Fast paced and easy to learn...,"I have yet to play the full version of this game because all the video rental stores are always rented out of it. I have only played the demo version on the Playstation Underground and it is already intense. It is very realistic and mostly true to the real world. The tricks are fairly easy to get the hang of and it is playable without really reading the instructions. If you want more challenge though, you should try out ""Thrasher Skate and Destroy"". It is even more realistic."
4,"If you have a Gameshark, use the anti-DK code...","This is a great game! The levels are BIG, and the conrol is easy to pick up. The only real problems with the game are these: 1. There is a Gameshark code that let's you disable the Dead Kennedys song. USE IT! All those great songs they put out, and someone chose the most annoying one to throw in the game. 2. The control lacks a certain finesse when you're in a tight spot, but nothing bad enough to make you want to bounce the controller of the TV."
5,DO NOT BUY THIS VIDEOGAME...,"...unless you want to spend all of your time thinking about grinds, ollies, and combinations. This game is totally fun, but very addictive. Ya know that feeling (for those of you who are ""older"") you had when you first played Tetris, and you'd see the shapes in your head when you were trying to sleep? That's how I feel about this game.It's easy to start playing, but difficult to master. This is absolutely the best game I've ever played on the PSX."
4,Very fun game.,"I'm not a fan of Skateboarding but I really liked this game. Good music and very fun for Skaters and non-skaters. The only thing I found was that it got boring fast, but then again I'm not a skater. I also don't like most sports games. Tony Hawk's Pro Skater did suprise me so if you like skating or even if you don't give this game a try."
2,"Revolutionary, but no depth","These days games carry SO MUCH depth, example game modes, characters, areas/platforms, etc. Unfortunately, TONY HAWK Pro Skater suffers in that area, which therefore makes it not worth the price of $40. On the PRO side, The graphics are simply tremendous, the levels look fabulous, character design, stats, all the features, brilliantly done. But it's not enough. The one player mode easily gets boring, but 2 player is revolutionary, they could've added multi tap, but NO. This game is worth 20, not $40, and wait for it to get on greatest hits."
2,big disapointment,"Tony hawk pro skater is an awful game. There is alot of blood, and it is annoying. The music is poor, using poor word choice.It is very annoying. Buy thrasher instead. It's a little bit of fun stating around, but it really sucks. It DEFINETLY ISN'T WORTH THE PRICE."
5,It works great!,"I love Tony Hawk skating games. This one is just as fun as the other ones, and has many modes to play."
4,Old School,This is one of the best basic skateboarding games produced. Its easy and fun. Well done!!
5,my man asc,"A masterpiece of an album from beginning to end. Alot of thought put into this one (as with all his other tunes). He has covered a pretty broad spectrum of sound on this lp. You've gotta check it to hear it for yourself. I love it more and more each time i play it thru.ASC has some of the most distinguisable and listenable dnb tunes out there, not surprising hes one of the most prolific dnb producers there is. Check his discography and releases when you get the chance.Whether listened and danced to in the clubs or sitting at work with headphones on. This is truley an inspiring piece of work by the one called ASC.Just a quick note, my all time favorite is ""what the future holds"".....great tunage.Look out for him in your city sometime, his dj skills are just as phenomenal as his music. Massive selection!"
1,Typo3: Enterprise Content Management,"I work daily with Typo3, managing 3 sites utilizing it, and always working with new extensions etc.etc.I purchased this book to help answer alot of questions in the daily management of Typo3, and found it very....very....disappointing. It had very little useful information (such as how to direct domains to subfolders, 0 information on the most common extensions, informative instruction in the use of those extensions, etc.) I am not very interested in the history of the programmers, although some information is good, you can always go to the site for more.In todays development world, books have to interact with a associated website. A great example would be ""More on CSS by Eric Myer"".So all in all, don't waste your $60 dollars, just find a friend that knows it and have him do a sit down."
1,The worst technical book ever,"I use Typo3 for a living and all I can say is this book is terrible. I am a strong book learner, I've learned most everything about any language, software or schema through O'Reilly, Friends of Ed or Sitepoint books. I could not learn Typo3 from this book. I know, you're thinking ""But Typo3 is so hard, I need a book and this is the only one, so I should just get it because it's the only choice."" I thought that too but it really isn't worth the paper it's printed on. Avoid unless money is no object."
2,Not the best choice,"Either this book is outdated or something like that, but it's not that usefull. 600 pages from which 100 at most can be at any use. I know that the book is old but still, 600 pages and you feel kind of confused and unmotivated to go on with typo3."
5,Absolute is right!,"This is just what I was looking for, it's clear and covers the basics, the fourdational information about databases. I'm very pleased with the purchase."
2,Visio version not stated,"This may be a good book, but after 50 pages and finding that I need Microsoft Access, as well as Visio to follow along, and then my Visio version doesn't have the required template...it is just a very frustrating book to get anywhere with. I'll keep trying, but this book just isn't for the beginner...sorry."
5,The Paper Bag Prince Brings Family Together,"My daughter brought home ""The Paper Bag Prince"" by Colin Thompson, from our trip to the library. What a delightful surprise when we sat down together to read it. The story itself is wonderful; it teaches children how nature works so hard to repair human polution, how the main character never lost sight of what was important in life (nature and home) and it demonstrates caring and compassion.But the best is yet to come. Along with this story is the most wonderful illustrations. Not only did we play ""I Spy"" on each page, but the illustrations make your eye and mind work so hard, you cannot help but be entertained.I have turned to Amazon to order my own copy, and look forward to sharing this artistic work with my nieces as well. This is a keeper! Bravo!"
5,Life saver,"Im 26 weeks pregnant and still getting sick multiple times a day. Ive tried zofran, crackers, ginger ale, etc and nothing helps. These are sooooo much more than candy! They help with my nausea and keep me from throwing up. In addition, they're super yummy. I love the green apple. These are such a blessing for the sick pregnant woman."
3,"Good product, terrible packaging","These did help with the morning sickness. That said, the lemon made my mouth feel numb so I avoided the lemon. The packaging was terrible! I had to throw my product away because these arrived melted...they were sticky on the outside of the plastic wrappers and the inside of the box had sticky, hardened candy all over the inside. I picked up a box a Babie R Us and thought the product itself worked great, except for the lemon."
3,so so,These were for my daughter and she didn't feel like they helped much. They just take your mind off of being sick.
5,Gave me my life back! And my lunch......,"My life and meal saver! My moment I became hungry I would feel sick and it's SOOOO hard to eat when you feel sick. It was an endless cycle force feeding myself. With these pops I sucked one before meals and I felt great before and after! Because I had a son already I didn't have time to be sick, but I felt so icky I didnt know what else to do then lay on the couch until it died off. These things have taken away it for the most part so I can be a mom. Even going to church isn't a constant worry of who's in the bathroom and how long can I go on. Whoever invented these things are God sent!"
2,Peggie Pops,"These didn't really help my severe morning sickness, but of all the pops and lozenges that I bought, these tasted the best and the distraction was nice."
3,Nice but small,This item is as nice as the photo but it doesn't stretch at all and is fairly small so I'm not sure how this can qualify for a one-size-fits all. Only buy it if you're about a size 6 or smaller.
4,ACCURATE for Weight but OK for Body Fat,"I'm very impressed by the weighing scale as it gave me correct information every time I measured the weight.I'm not sure if I can say the same about the body fat. I checked my body fat 4 times in 3 days since I got this equipment and I got 4 different readings - 18.4, 19, 19.6 and 22.4. I'm not sure which is the right one, but you can guess which one I want to be true reading. I'm not sure if that has to do with my really active workout schedule - 6 days a week and 1.5 hours a day.I'm an athlete according to the machine (The setup book says anyone who has a resting heart rate of less than 60 should setup his/her profile as athlete). I know my body fat is slightly less than 20, so the machine is close but not accurate.All in all, for weight measurement I give this machine a 5 and for body fat measurement I give it a 3."
3,Object Lesson,"Whether the characters in Kuo's book continue to exercise the influence they did is questionable. The 2006 elections changed the political dynamic in Washington; the ""base politics"" of Karl Rove, et al., may no longer set the tone of campaigns and the priorities of elected officials.Forces with radical agendas (right-wing, left-wing, alternate-universe) remain active, however, and politicians will continue to try to placate them and exploit their passions. Young idealists will continue to be dismayed by Realpolitik.""Tempting Faith"" is a now-dated but still useful object lesson in the disillusioning realities of politics and governance."
4,Tempting Faith: An Inside Story of Political Seduction,"This book was very well written and most informative of the working of the White House and various individuals in Washington, D.C."
4,A Secret Society Member Cannot be a Christian,"Bush has been a ""Skull and Bones"" secret society member since his years at Yale University. This fact was known to the leaders of Churchianity who endorsed him for reelection in spite of his membership, which was confirmed by Tim Russert on national TV. ""Pro-lifers"" who voted for Bush never gave a damn about all the abortions Bush's bombing of mothers in Iraq and Afghanistan caused. Abortion by American bombs is just fine by them. These one-issue voters are obsessed with homosexuals and abortion and yet are complicit in mass murder of Muslim civilians, corporate greed and defrauding of workers who are not paid a living wage and are enslaved by usury. Kuo's book is a corrective, but the misuse of the Bible by Judeo-Churchianity continues. I gave the book 4 stars because Kuo does not expose Bush's idolatry of rabbis & Zionism; a fact too hot to handle, even though this is where religious-fanatic influence on the White House begins, but it is unassailable."
3,Temptng Faith by David Kuo,The book arrived in prime condition. It is a very well writtenand educational book in regards how the Givernement is run.. Price and delivery were vey good.
5,Pres. Bush...smarter than we thought...,"It seems George W. may be smarter than we thought. This book does an excellent job highlighting how Evangelicals (among others) were strung along with promises of Faith Based Initiatives only to be let down time and again. President Bush kept religious leaders happy and was able to court their support while actually not doing anything, not one single thing. Remarkable. I was always against the Faith Based stuff until I read Mr. Kuo's book. If the plans Mr. Kuo and others put forward were actually treated seriously or even paid attention to they could have had positive, far-reaching effects.This book is a great insider's tale / autobiography. I view President Bush in a new light now, positive and negative."
2,"The PhD Companion: Lacking, but (kind of) entertaining","I purchased this book and another called How to get a PhD by Phillips and Pugh, which was far superior to this book; thus, I don't recommend buying it.It's organized chronologically, as if it's taking the reader through the emotional/intellectual/experiential ups and downs of the PhD student. This organization works well and reads easily. The authors adopted a chatty and informal tone that doesn't sit so well. Further, their observations, with only a handful of exceptions, seemed not far beyond the realm of common sense. They've included a nubmer of historical anecdotes which are interesting, but not particularly helpful.If you're looking for a solid introduction to and guide through PhD studies that is serious and packed with useful information, I'd avoid this volume."
1,Do Not Order From this company!,I paid for priority S&H....it has been 5 days now and I still have not recieved my item even after contacting this company and being reassured it would arrive in time for my event!
5,Fantastic guide,"This is by far the most interesting and valuable travel guide I've ever come across. It's an incredibly rich source of information for anyone wishing to experience the natural world in Australia.The book has two basic sections: First, a state-by-state guide to specific places, such as national parks and other outstanding areas to see wildlife. And second, a fairly comprehensive overview of Australia's birds, mammals, and other wild animals. Both sections are packed with useful and fascinating information, augmented with excellent maps and photos.As a committed nature geek who makes frequent and extended trips to Australia, I can't imagine traveling Down Under without this indispensible book. Thanks so much to the authors for doing a great job, and to Lonely Planet for publishing such a fine book. Very strongly recommended!"
3,BOSCH LAMINATE TRIMMER,I AM A FLOORING SUB-CONTRACTOR AND HAVE USED THIS LAMINATE TRIMMER WHILE INSTALLING LAMINATE FLOORS. I OWN 4 OTHER BOSCH PRODUCTS BECAUSE OF THIER QUALITY AND RELIABILITY. THIER TOOLS PERFORMANCE AND DURABILITY ARE SECOND TO NONE AT THIS PRICE RANGE; BUT THE COMPANY GETS LOW MARKS FOR DIFFICULTY IN OBTAINING PARTS AND ACCESSORIES IN THE AFTERMARKET. THIS IS THE ONLY REASON I GIVE THIS PRODUCT A 3 STAR RATING.
3,Unique book on dreams during pregnancy,"This book is one of a kind as far as I know - I'm not aware of another book that covers the dreams of expectant mothers. So if you're a mum-to-be, and you have smme strange dreams, as my wife did, you'll be able to relate and put your dreams in some context.One thing I'll say that is disappointing is that when my wife was pregnant in 1999/2000, while we lived in Brooklyn Heights, she was interviewed by one of the authors, Sindy Greenberg, about her dream (the one about carrying the chocolate eggg with the baby in it) for this book. Sindy promised she'd send a book after it was published.After the book came out my wife contacted Ms Greenberg and asked to have a copy sent to her. No copy was ever sent. My wife had to buy her own copy of the book whose content she provided in part. Shame on you, Sindy."
2,Not what I hoped for,"I was hoping to find a dream analysis book that was like a dictionary...where I could look up certain dreams quickly and interpret their meanings. This book related to pregnancy but was in no particular order or theme, so it was difficult to skim through, trying to find a dream similar to mine. It was neat to read about the dreams that women had, but it wasn't helpful to me at all with MY dreams."
2,"Dont buy this unit, bad design","10 of us have this Rhino Pro 5000. My beef is the tape exiting the unit as it completes the printing process. It gets caught on the ridge as it exits, thus getting caught up inside the unit rendering the entire cartridge unusable. Furthermore, we purchased 50 boxes of tape. Each box contains 5 tapes. As the tapes sat in the office in a dry cool place, the tape now curls. If it does come out of the unit, it is very curly. To top it off, it is very hard to peel. I would look at another unit next time. Although this has great features, it is a pain to print out the tape and peel."
4,Nice Tool!,"Bang for buck, this is a handy kit if you wish to make your work look nicely finished. When you first start using it, you may be a little intimidated because it looks like it will be difficult to use, but grab a cup of coffee, take some time and read the instructions while going through the motions and you will find that it is quite easy.The labels look professional and seem to stay put. Dymo makes quite a few different label cartridges for the unit which adds to versatility of the tool. The fact that you can write labels to shrink tubing is an added bonus. The only negative thing I can think of is that the labeling cartridges can be a little costly, but other than that... the tool seems to be good. If you do a lot of ""wrap around"" labels, you may wish to invest in the 5200 model."
4,Great product!,"The power handsaw is fantastic, however the manual provided left much to be desired. The saw came with 3 blades, but the manual told you nothing about the blades and their uses. With a better manual this would have been a five star product!"
2,Poor Design,"I have used this tool a few times and each times I was disappointed. it had enough power and somewaht worked but the blade kept coming lose and fall off while in use. I checked it several times and I did put it on correctly. I wish I would have spent the extra money for the tool that I really wanted instead of saving money"" with this junk that I can barely use it at all."
3,Two stars off for NOT including a case.,"This is a ""five star"" tool that comes in a cardboard case. I bought this the Bosch flush cutter for undercutting some difficult door frames in my house and this tool was just what the doctor ordered. I highly recommend it. But come on Bosch!!! Who's the knuckehead that approved selling this fine saw without a decent case?"
5,amazing value,I love this tool it saved me from getting a crain cutter to do door jambs yes it is not as quick but i like the control of it and i have seen to many people hurt themselves with those dam sidewinder type flush cut saws. i perfer this type of saw plus i feel it leaves a cleaner cut with less patch work to the adjacent molding.as good as the saw it for jambs i like that this thing has other uses and doesn't just sit in the truck and only get used once in awhile. for $100 it seems to do twice as much work as a crain cutter.
5,Great Versatility,This can be used in many ways from cutting door jambs to mitering corners. Great tool. Great idea. Much more control than sawsall. I used it the other day to chop off some stair balasters the first day I got and it worked perfect. be careful tho of kickbacks when cutting in tight locations.
4,Bosch Saves the Day,"I only had four door frames to install trim to, but would have had to add another six hours to the job to peel off the old baseboard just to cut back to allow for the new trim. Not having to re-attach, caulk and paint the baseboard, which may have included repair in some cases, saved a lot of time. The tool took a bit of adjusting to for this application, but well worth the money! A must-have if you are not replacing baseboards."
4,Quick comments,"I had a tough time finding this saw. None of the local ""big box"" stores carried it. The saw is, as described by others, a tool that will not be used continuously, or much at all, but I used it almost immediately to cut more than a kerf-sized slit behind an inside window frame (molding) over a bathtub. This permitted the installation of plastic waterproof panels underneath the molding (otherwise, the panels would have had to be trimmed with a jigsaw, which would work but not as well). To do that task by hand with some kind of flexible saw would have been extremely labor-intensive, and I am too old for that! The Bosch saw is well made, and worked well. Over a year ago I could have used this saw to trim door casings when installing a tile floor in my home."
2,The Blade Does Not Last Long,"I was very disappointed to see the blade bcome dull after a relatively light use. Disappointed? Yes,"
5,and it's CLEANER!,"I agree with all the other positive comments posted on this quality saw and have one to add: This saw does not fill the air with dust like the typical high speed rotary blade saws do, so you can work with it indoors without making a big mess. Perfect for installing wood and laminate floors. The more I use it, the more I cherish it. Wish that I had the mitre box for it."
3,Bosch trim saw,"Its better than cutting off all the door trim and jambs by hand but only just. The switch is either on or off and the variable speed is a separate wheel. It is unsafe as well as difficult to operate. With the saw turned on, the operater is handling a dangerous tool that could easily cut him. If the switch was designed like a drill switch the operater would have more control and variable speed.Blade change is easy."
5,finecut power handsaw,"If you do any flooring and you need to undercut door trim or jambs, you'll never go back without this tool after you've used one. Tool changes an arduous backbreaker to `get outta the way' move on now. Indispensible for certain tasks. One thing I do wish, is that there were a more aggressive tooth pattern for special tasks where a sawzall might be a bit much of a challange."
5,Multiple unkown uses...,"Among all of the defined uses for this saw, it's amazing how you'll find yourself reaching for it at the spur of the moment... just when you're about to get angry and start ripping stuff apart, you remember you have it and make a nice cut on something. Plus its smaller size lets you get into places that a sawzall won't reach. Great product."
4,Great when you need it,"This saw can be a bit of a handful when free cutting and won't do everything you wish it could do but it is a life (and huge time) saver when there is a job it is suitable for. Be cautious around the exposed teeth (no guard). So far, so good."
4,Epic for a video game.,"The themes and motifs are wonderful, as is the sound quality. At times I felt like I was listening to ""Lord of the Rings."" My favorite track is ""Thorn's Lair."" It's just so sinister and cool. A great score for a great game."
5,Thoroughly enjoyable and catchy music!,"My 5 and almost 3 year old love boys love this DVD, the songs are catchy and the music is great. This is our first Wiggles DVD, but we have a couple CDs, some old some new. We haven't been Wiggles fans long enough to think nothing can compare to Greg, we enjoy both singers equally. I think Sam and crew did a fantastic job on this, his voice is perfect for the songs! I enjoy listening to this DVD, several upbeat songs (""sing a song of sixpense"" and ""over in the meadow"" are my two favorites, catchy and upbeat versions). There's a slower song (""black velvet band"") in the middle which the kids didn't care for at the beginning but now they actually pay to the story it's telling. They both cackle when humpty dumpty falls down too (typical boys!). Great DVD worth adding to your Wiggles or children's collection!"
3,Boo,Yawwwwn..if this dvd was made to put kids to sleep then it serves its purpose.. the songs r so slow! The only reason i gave it some stars is because it keeps my daughter entertained for a good fifteen min.
5,Bizarre and well-written,"This is a terrific and bizarre book. Disturbing in its realism because people like this really exist. People who have the diseases which led to the vampire myth. How they deal with their diseases, and how tempting a vampire lifestyle is when you're looked upon by society as nothing less than a real vampire. The characters are realistic and the author keeps the story moving. He has a rare talent for delivering a message without being preachy."
3,Strong Smell,"Although fragrance free, this lotion has a medicinal or chemical smell. It applies easily. The sunblock ingredients contain octinoxate and avobenzone which are somewhat controversial."
4,Good when you get it working,"Compared to the Rio, the F20 has much better sound quality, and slightly better quality of construction. It has worse control ergonomics, and takes some fiddling to get the software working."
1,Highly not recommended,"When I first got the player, I was very happy with it, the space was limited though, and file transfers were pretty low. Then I upgraded to windows NT ... and the player is completely incompatible. I tried e-mailing eiger labs, my first e-mail went completely unread or responded too, and after my FOURTH e-mail, I finally got a response saying that no, it did not support NT software, and they never plan to make compatible software ... all my further e-mails were ignored. It is a good deal, and if you can get compatible software, its a great player ... but don't buy it to find you can completely not use it. Also, the customer support has just been god awful, and offered no help or even apology."
1,Forget it if you need any support.,"There isn't a rebate now but if it pops up again, forget it. Not only will you not get a rebate, you won't get ANY customer support. Not even an automated return email. The player itself is actually pretty good in sound quality if you get your computer software to work (GOOD LUCK), albeit a bit slow in downloading mp3s. You have to download 1 song at a time. It takes my 900mhz TBird about 1 minute per song using the parallel port. About 18 minutes to load up 64MB. Just my $.02."
3,"Good Deal, for the Price","This is an excellent machine for the money. Very light andplays great. But you will have to upgrade it to 64MB ... . Even then, you will get slightly more than 60 minutes of music on it (128Kb - don't kid yourself into thinking MP3 is even adequate below that level, it's not). This does not play wma files - which sound just as good at 64Kb as mp3's do at 128kb. I returned mine and bought the Intel Pocket Concert - and I'm much happier. If you can afford better, I recommend you do not buy this."
1,Does NOT support Win NT,"This player is lying in my drawer for almost a year now, since I am using NT4 on all of my computers. MPman.com keeps on promising NT support, but until now they just did not make it. Appearently, there has been a software version that promised to support NT. A friend of mine tried to install it, resulting in an error message that a dll is missing and will be delivered with next release. I am still waiting for that release... Only response I got from them so far is: ""We are working on it..."":(("
1,This Product has horrible sound quality,"this product is extremely sad when it comes to the quality of the sound. I think if you are planning on buying a Portable Mp3 player, buy the Rio...it comes in pretty colors too!"
1,Don't buy this....,"Fortunately, Amazon was good enough to refund my son's money on this MP3 player. The software is un-friendly, customer support from EigerLabs nonexistent. It was unusable. Don't buy this..."
5,AWSOME!!!!!!!!!,It is AWSOME!!! I mean just download the mp3 off the net! Easy as that! I whould pay like $20 for one song that I like on a CD where i can download it for free with this!! I HIGHLY recommend you pruchase this product!
1,"Bad Company, Bad Product....Bad. Bad, Bad......","I bought this unit from Amazon about 2 months ago, and it still dosn't work, I waited for NT 4.0 drivers that company promised would be ready in July, and then on their web site they had a notice it would be available soon, whan I called them 3 weeks ago they finally admitted they had no plans to release it. So I put on win98 machine same problem it dosn't play it keeps sayng stop....I called tech support, andthey promied to send RMA number to my e-mail, they never did....their phone number makes you wait forever, and nobody answers.....bad company, bad product....."
2,"good player, awful customer support","While the sound quality on the MPMan is quite good, the setup can be a nightmare. The documentation for the MPMan is spartan at best and totally useless at worst. The customer support line is basically an answering service involving hours of phone tag and mixed messages. If you have good computer savvy and are willing to risk needing customer support from Eiger Labs, the player might not be bad for you, but otherwise I would stay far, far away from this player."
4,Do you know computers?,"This item is relatively easy to setup if you have a decent understanding of computer hardware. For most systems it requires changing irq's in the bios. The provided documentation is terrible and the software is mediocre. The unit itself however, in my opinion, provides better sound quality than a rio."
3,Win2000/XP Driver is finally available!,"Eigerlabs (officially MPMan.com, Inc.) seemed to have revitalized their business with a great new website, a bunch of new line of mp3 players, and....the MUCH MUCH OVERDUE Win2000/XP driver for Eigerman F20! (which you can download at www.mpman.com)F20 claims to be the first MP3 Player ever, invented in 1997. Quality wise I think F20 has an excellent sound quality and decent functionalities.However, in light of today's more sophisticated mp3 players out there, you shouldn't even be thinking about buying it. Besides, they've discontinued the product anyway.But thank you MPMan.com for the Win2000/XP Driver!!!"
3,Its ok,"Good sound, solid consturction. But, since it doesnt have much storage space you cant store many songs on it. Good buy for the price though."
1,now windows 2000 support,I can't believe this company doesn't support NT or Win 2000. The lack of support for >32 MB Smart Media cards is also annoying. The manufacturer should wake up.
5,Great Product,This is a great product. I have been trying to decide on an mp3 player for a long time I decided on this one because of the price. I have no regrets. The only thing is there was not really an instruction manual or any info on the buttons. However They did include a paper saying how to install and get music. The earphones arent the best but they are fine. I have windows 98 and have had no problems with anything.
1,Why they can't give this thing away.,This is a real review - not a plant by some Eiger Labs company hack. Don't waste your money on this product. It is a real piece of junk. I can't get mine installed despite repeated attempts. The documentation provided with the product is a joke. It is literally a photocopied 4 page piece of paper. I have called the support number for a week straight and never gotten a live person. Everytime they email me in response to my inquiry they send the same automatic response message. Lastly the software provided is horrible. It is a bunch of clippings from 3rd party web sites. I obviously can't tell you how this thing sounds since I've never gotten it working. Please save yourself the hassle - stay away from this product. Eiger Labs doesn't care about servicing its customers.
2,Battery life and other problems,"I purchased an F20 a while ago. Maybe I have a pre-production unit or something. The unit eats batteries even when it's not turned on. I'm also having problems getting the thing to operate properly (buttons don't always work). I've emailed Eiger Labs customer support with no response. When I can get it to work, it sounds great (when I can get it working)."
3,Decent information in a really lame story. Nothing new,"This is a very quick read. 1-2 hours and you're done. It's a cute little story about 2 people trying to improve quality and performance for their company. The story is about the advice they receive from a friend which is simple and presented well. It's really nothing you can't find in just about every other management book out there. Analyze the problem, look for options and choose the best method to fix it. If you're reading this, chances are you've read other management books. There isn't anything groundbreaking here. But there certainly isn't anything bad about it either. I personally would recommend ""The Power of Six Sigma"" by Subdir Chowdry over this. But you won't go wrong if you do decide to pick this one up."
3,Borrow it from the Library,For as fast as you can read it and that you don't need the book afterwards to review what you learned or don't. I suggest borrowing it from the Library and save your $10 for something worthwhile.
4,Zap with Action - Zapping the gaps with 'We n Us',"Zap the Gaps is a sure fire way with tips n tricks to improve the Management skills n shoot rise high the company performance. The book marvels a class to bridge the gaps to approach, find and resolve the root causes of the management flaws at grass root levels. The authors state to adopt enhanced strategies to bridge the gaps between the management n employees. The win to excel rule is applied to better the workplace environment to sail smooth in a more applied work force results. The authors have engaging tale with examples as they focus on the problem of high tech firm and their tool Zap gapper brings in a sea of change to tackle the issues. A must read for CEOs n Managers to boost up their egos n bring out the potentialities of employees to scale for better performance. It sure is like zapping in action for results with a more 'Team work - We n Us'"
5,Clarifying Barriers to Change,"When I finished reading this book, I couldn't believe how well the authors had identified the barriers, in organizations and in individuals, that prevent employees from achieving maximum performance. Too often as line managers, we establish expectations for employees, without knowing if the expectations can be achieved in our current environment, and if the employee has the skill and knowledge to make it happen. This book blew me away with its insight and suggestions for partnering with employees to ""Go for the Win!"" A must read for managers!!!"
2,One page of guidance spun into a 100 page story,"I read this book in about an hour. I suspect the authors were able to churn this little ""fable"" out in about three (3) working days. The essential message of the book is quite valid. The delivery is rather problematic.I do have one question: What was in it for Mike?"
5,Triple H:Pro Wrestler Hunter Hearst Helmsley(Pro Wrestler),What is the matter with the first reviewer? Triple H did not get to the top by Shawn Michaels or by going to bed with the bosses daughter.(AND HE WOULD NOT GO TO BED WITH VINCE BECAUSE HE IS NOT GAY.) The reviewer is a IDIOT. Triple H is the best wrestler in the WWE. That guy ticked off the wrong Triple H fanatic.
2,THE BOOK IS COPY & PASTE,"friends, get away form this book.the informacion on the book is a ""copy & paste"" from the internet.If You want to know the life of triple h, buy the book write from triple h inselfTriple H Making the Game: Triple H's Approach to a Better Body (WWE)"
1,I really tried to read this,"but the darn thing was so hard to understand. Every other word was -UH- and when I disagreed with the book, I would find myself hitting the glass ceiling. It may be demolition, but I think there are better books out there like ""Steroids: Myths and Facts"" and ""How to alienate an entire generation""."
1,Amazon not providing correct product information,"The other vendors selling hole saws on Amazon.com provide pictures of hole saws without the arbor and specify in the text that an arbor is needed and which model to purchase. Other pictures show the hole saw with an arbor when they are offered together as is often the case.Only this version of the Milwaukee hole saw which is being sold directly by Amazon.com shows a picture of a hole saw with an arbor and yet the buyer receives a hole saw without an arbor. No where in the text is it mentioned that a arbor is needed much less which size is needed as there are 2 distinct arbor sizes required for different Milwaukee (and Lenox, Morse, Bosch, etc.) hole saws.I realize that the product managers at Amazon are not the most diligent people and my efforts to communicate with them directly fell on deaf ears."
1,Kenwood discmans suck.,"I've had 4 returned 3 on warranty. All 4 had problems right from new, and 2 of them have totally broken down. I have talked to many other people who have had problems too. Usually worse problems than mine."
1,The fifty most trite things ever published,"When a book title contains quantity and superlatives you know that it's either a technical reference or low-brow crap. This book is not a technical reference.One of the greatest challenges in writing about love and romance is avoiding the usual clichés and sentimentality. One can view them as cruel stumbling blocks thrown in the author's path. For the most part we admire an author who is nimble enough to avoid them. In Frauline von Mueffling's case we are aghast by the degree to which she willingly embraces these obstacles. Clearly what we have here is a writer without imagination trying to appeal to reader's without imagination. In the end we are left with a simple methodological question: ""is this stuff literary trash or historical trash?"""
3,121,Be aware that the model that is being sold is 121not 221 as shown in the product manual that you candownload. A completely different speaker.
3,Not worth $30,"Well, I needed a cheap set of speakers for my lappy, and found these at office depot for 10 bucks. I use them for online broadcasts and some music, every once in a while. They are soooo not worth 30 bucks, but for 10 I am keeping them.The bass is really hard to get right, it muffles some songs and is non-existant on others. Without the bass on, the other speakers are not worth listening to.In order to get the best from the speakers, play with your audio drivers, I used a 5.1 surround sound setting (which is the only one I had for a bass) and it took 90% of the muddy sounds out."
4,GOOD SPEAKERS FOR SUCH A LOW PRICE,"These are speakers for people who just like to listen to music and is not all caught up in the bass and trebles and all the technical stuff. They have good clarity, but really not much bass. Which is ok for computer speakers, especially if you already have a stereo system or home theater system in your home. For 22 dollars,these speakers are a great deal and I recommend these, unless you want to pay the little extra money to get the 221's."
3,Good information,It's a good book... contains great information on the legal process to change your name. A must have!
5,Great demo hammer,"This a greet demo hammer for medium to small jobs. Especially for block and brick. It also does well on concrete, but I worry that it may be too hard on the tool. I now have 3 of these. One last thing, I used to be an eBay junkie, but now I'm leaning toward Amazon whenever I can."
2,Caveat Emptor,"The problem with all CS books is they show pretty outfits, which anyone with a little taste can create, but they lack direction on integrating the pieces into a functional wardrobe. Are the pictures pretty? Yes. Do you need another purple jacket that doesn't match with anything else than one outfit? CS books are about 90% single-outfit ensembles. Consider this before buying."
2,Beautiful to look at but not a practical guide,"The design and photos are beautiful and elegant. I loved the layout and it's a book I enjoy leafing through for pleasure.As a practical guide to building a wardrobe I found it frustrating. The clothes shown are lovely but seem very geared toward people with a lot of money and/or time who can afford to purchase chothes at exclusive boutiques (or comb through sales racks & thrift stores). Many items shown also come from private collections. As a small, pear-shaped mom with a limited budget and no time I just couldn't imagine how I'd ever build such a wardrobe.Sooo if you want a lovely book to look at, this is great. If you want a quick, easy to use workbook for any budget, look elsewhere.I continue to dream of a simple workbook that will help a woman with budget, time, and figure limitations build a great wardrobe. (Feel free to email recommendations)."
3,Nice pictures,"This book has great pictures -- full color, lots of white space (like those great DK books for kids). I found the clothing to be slightly matronly and not exactly pret-a-porte, but perhaps that's because I'm younger than the target audience (women 30+).What this book does right: give you a basic understanding of a basic wardrobe and how to shop intelligently to put together a good closet of basics; a checklist of must-have items (or at least items to think about owning); a basic understanding of higher fashion and why/when it's useful to own some more expensive pieces of clothing; great photos (of not-necessarily-great outfits).I enjoyed the tone of the book, intelligent and sassy, like an older more-fashionable friend. I also enjoyed a section that gave a general picture of how fashion plays out in different regions, just for the social science buff in me.I wouldn't make this book your fashion bible, but if you are fashionably clueless, it's a good place to start."
2,For absolute beginners with a sizable budget.,"I rate a fashion reference book by the number of times I've actually referenced it. Including the initial read, I've referenced this book once since.If you are an absolute fashion beginner (with little or no existing wardrobe to build upon) with a sizable budget, get this book. The pictures are fabulous, and the cuts and styles are basic enough to find even today -- among finer designers.If not, skip it."
5,An incredible resource for fashion-conscious folk!,"Love it, love it, love it! Got it for xmas in '98-- keep it on my nightstand-- and look at it for inspiration! Would love it even more if it just contained picture after picture of combinations! With spring ahead, I'm ready to clean out my closet, give my old stuff to charity and simplify my wardrobe with their classic ideas. Great stuff!!!"
1,A definition book rather than style or fashion.,"This book is terribly simple. It gives no suggestion of style but plenty of definition to the different types of clothing. It does nothing for my wardrobe. The one star is for the pretty pictures. Eventhough one outfit is shown with other pieces, you still have to find and buy those other pieces... more to clutter your closet with. If mix and match is what you want, you are better off taking advice from Spiegel catalogs."
4,Simply excellent!,"A simple, commonsense approach to style; this book shows how to pare away all the excess and utilize the basics to become a well-dressed woman. The photography is minimalist, with the emphasis on the clothing, not models. There are no people in the whole book, and the various quotes are thought-provoking and often funny. My favorite part is the source guide! Altogether an invaluble resource"
5,All Time Favorite Career Book,This book is timeless. The clothes are classic and you will learn how to save money with the examples that they give. I look at this book All the time.
1,"For lovers of quotes, not clothes","Simple, o.k., but where's the chic? Huge print fills pages with all kinds of quotations about clothes, but the combinations suggested are anything but inspiring. Your Mom knows all this from years of dressing experience, so buy her some flowers, take her to tea and ask her for her advice, instead of getting yourself this dust collector."
2,Not Without a Zen Teacher,"This is a great collection of koans, but after reading the book, I realized I would need a Zen teacher to really learn how to attain enlightenment via koans."
2,Another DIET book...when will we learn?,"Roizen helps people learn how their body works and how to get in touch with it. The criticism I have of the book is that he advocates a special diet, rather than focusing on what your body tells you it needs. Another book ""The Overfed Head"" by Rob Stevens shows you how to do that with the goal of losing weight. I think the information from Roizen and the knowledge from Rob Stevens would be the perfect combination to lose weight and be healthy and feel great....so check out ""The Overfed Head"" in addition to this book.....I lost 15 pounds in one month without any sort of diet and have kept it off! Dieting only works while you are on the diet."
5,Review You on A Diet,You: On A Diet: The Owner's Manual for Waist ManagementWhat I have read so far in this book is easy to read and understand. It is not a book about how most of us think of as a Diet Book; it is more about what happends to the food that we do consume and how it moves or doesn't move through our body and supplies nutrients to the different organs etc of our bodies. It talks about what happens to the foods like sugar. Love the cartoon diagrams as they are easy to understand. It is the type of book you will want to keep around for reference. I love watching Dr. Oz on TV and this was one of the reasons I bought this book because his name was on it.
3,IT'S OK,"There isn't any really new information in this book, but it's put together in a way that makes it easily accessible. All the various topics are well covered in a style that's not pedantic, but it's not full of ground breaking news. Or maybe it is, for people who aren't as diet obsesed as I..which, by the way, isn't necessarily a good thing."
2,I liked this book as much as cellulite,"While Oz and co. might have some useful advice, good diet tips and groundbreaking news for anyone battling their weight - the book is practically unbearable to read. It is so wrought with lame jokes, bizarre cliches, cheesy metaphors and otherwise unfunny attempts at humor that I just couldn't stand it. I am not exaggerating when I tell you that there are more than three or four of these types of inclusions on every page. I don't know why a respected doctor would litter his book and obscure his message with gratuitous (and lame) jokes.I'm all for information the ""Average Joe"" can comprehend and a dieting book that isn't a drag to read, but seriously, this is a right mess. The editor should be banished to the comic book wing of his firm!I am giving this two stars instead of one because I believe Oz does have some decent information for overweight people."
4,Too many corny analogies but fantastic information!,"I loved this book. The information is phenomenal and very helpful in turning around the attitude toward ""diets"" we have. The only stumbling block for me is the constant use of corny analogies. One every minute! But on the whole this is a great read. I intend to follow the recommendations!"
3,Informative.,This book is informative and a good primer for people who need clear explanations about the body.I found it to be somewhat distracting due to all of the puns and sarcasm intertwined amongst the data. Some of it was clever and a lot of it was distracting to me.All in all it was thorough and knowledgeable in addition to motivating a person toward better health. It would be a great high school text.
3,Ok Diet Book,"I purchased this on the recommendation of my doctor. It is an easy read, the cartoons are cute. However, it really didn't tell me that much new. By eating more healthy foods and exercising more, we can all be in better shape."
4,Please and impressed,"I have never purchased or even gone through a diet type program. I'm 66, 5'9"" and weigh 182. What I have is about 8lbs I like to get rid of and reduce my waist size back to 33 from 35. I feel confident this book will help do what I want but more importantly provide me with the knowledge to keep the extra weight off. I highly recommend the book to anyone interested in loosing weight."
3,Good information but format is distracting & hard to read,"I was very excited when I first bought this book. I read it in 3 sittings but mind you, reading it like a novel is really difficult because it is chock full of sidebars, illustrations, comics and the like. Too bad they had to dumb it down because the gist of what they are saying is really informative. I loved reading the information they provided but they put it in such a jokey tone that you can really tell they are trying to direct the book to the lowest common denominator--i.e. IQ of 9. I didn't expect a text book but I think there is a lot of leeway between making interesting information in an approachable format and creating a diet book in comic book form."
3,Good Book,"This is a good book with a lot of emphasis on the physical ""going-on's"" inside the body. Less of a weight loss advice book and more of a book on the mechanics of our bodies. An interesting read with great humor through out. Gets a little reduntant at times and doesn't offer any sounder advice than than eat less, move more."
1,"stupid illustrations, stupid jokes","I didn't even make it through the first chapter. This book may very well contain great diet information, but the format is a deal-breaker. The illustrations belong in a third-grade book, and the stupid 'jokes' woven into the text are just distracting. There was a line about some making passes faster than a teenage boy working a movie theater. First of all - WTF? Second, I was offended on behalf of teenage boys, many of whom are NOT cretins!"
1,Useless,"For the author's/publisher's sake, its a good thing this book got all the press hype at publication. I can't imagine it sold any from reader recommendations."
1,Have not received item,I still have not received the book. I just realized that when I receive the email to review the book.
2,Too silly for me.,"I am just not crazy with the silly style this book is written in, others might like this but I find it annoying and unreadable. The two week diet looks good but I was disapointed that there is no food lists of what to eat and what to avoid. It just seems incomplete."
4,If you follow it it will work,The book was well written and easy to follow. However no matter what the good doctor says it is a diet. And like all other diets that I have tried for my whole life if you follow it it will work. We people who have struggled with weight for our whole lives know exactly what to do. We know that it takes committment and great strength. Most of us have it for only a short period of time including me. Sooo . . . if you are really ready to make that committment to yourself this is an interesting book and will help but in the long run it is just another diet book.
5,This One's for Real!,"Having OD'd on studies in medical journals for the past couple of years, I'm delighted to find writers who can make routinely dry information truly enjoyable while still providing solid research findings.I've felt for some time that there was more help available for overweight than the simple ""just don't overeat"" advice that is the foundation of so many diet books. That advice works exactly as well as the ""Just Say No"" campaign!This book offers the answers I needed, based on solid research. That those answers are presented with a light touch is a plus!New ideas are sprinkled throughout, interrelationships between hormones, food, and stress explained. Thank you.Highly recommended!"
4,You: On a Diet: The Owners Manual for Waist Management,I have enjoyed reading this book. It also makes sense on the eating strategy. I am ttying it now and it seems to work.
5,You:On A Diet: The Owners Manual for Waist Management,This book is as good as it gets. I love Dr Oz and don't know any other doctor who can simplify things so well. Excellent resource.
4,It's working,This book is the best I have come across thus faras it pertains to dieting. If I applied a littlemore effort on the physical side I know the resultswould be more pronounced.
4,health and diet book,This is a good book. Has a lot of good information about your body and how to bring it to a healthy level. Lot of good reading about diet and exercise. I would highly recommend it.
5,Factual,First diet book I have read that addresses the feelings that people experience when dieting and failing time and again. It is very validating for someone who has dealt when overweight for a number of years.
4,Owners Manual for Waist Management,I have not viewed this DVD yet. I plan to do it this weekend. I think it looks like a really good tool to use with the You on A Diet book.
3,Boook Review,"Thw book titled 'You: On A Diet"" is not at all what I expected. A lot of reading and a lot of receipes included foods we would never eat. Very disappointing."
4,"Clear, Informative and Fun","One week after reading the book and following it's guidelines, I had already lost 1"" in my waist and had no feeling of being on a diet. Two of my nieces had announced that improving their eating habits and losing weight were on both their lists of New Year's resolutions, and I felt confident in recommending they start with this informative and fun book. They did and had similar results. Having a better picture of exactly what happens in your body after your first bite, and even moments before, makes you a responsible partner in taking care of your beautiful body and it feels great."
2,not worth it,"I bought this book based on the PBS special. Big mistake. do yourself a favor, copy or tivo the PBS special and forget this book. I was expecting the same format and discussion as the PBS special. i actually enjoyed the PBS special. The book is disorganized. The index is shoddy. many many aspects covered in the TV special are not even in the book (aargh). The book could use a seasoned editor. if the book followed the same organized and simple format of the PBS special, then it would be worth it. The book is somehow (dont know the relationship) sponsored by the disovery channel. The discovery channel is not known for their high quality of editing and scientific reverance. had i known they were behind it, probably would not have bought the book. i like the authors, i like what they are saying, just dont like the book."
2,on a diet,"if you are ADD or ADHD this style of book might appeal to you. If you are a serious reader, like to read through a book this one is not for you. too much extra crap in the margins and is very distracting. I actually can't read the thing because it make my eyes wander off the page."
5,Information we all need,Dr. Oz explains how your body works and the necessary steps you take to control the type of food your body needs.
5,YOU: On a Diet,"This is very comically, but written so all educational levels can understand the messages. I am a frim believer that these to physicians are by far the most down to earth and pratical, professional people I have ever heard or read. I have been fortunate to see their presentations on ""OPRAH"" and ""GOOD MORNING AMERICA"" AND THE ""TODAY SHOW"" and they have the interviewers as well as the audience capitvated. Unless you have a major medical issue there is no reason that praticing what is in this book cannot result in a mjor imrovement in one's well being and mental state of mind. I mean when they tell you how important your elimination results need to be and that is who we are how much more direct and sincere is that. These men tell it like it is in very common terms."
4,Knowledge is power,"The information in this book helps you to start a healthy ""lifestyle"" not a diet. When you make a decision to be a healthy person, this book can be a powerful tool."
4,Good for the Non Scientists,"As a science educator, I know about the scientific knowledge of the general population. Most people have not gotten past high school biology, and tried to repress that class as it was.This book is written for people interested in how their bodies work, but who haven't had a science class in a while. Yes, the advice is a lot of rehashed information. Yes, the analogies are numerous and corny, the cartoons are silly. BUT, this book will educate people about more than just diet and exercise; as well as keep them entertained. I think if I gave this book to my students instead of one of the regular textbooks they would learn more because of the entertainment value."
1,"""Waist"" of Time",I can condense the entire book into 4 sentences:1. Eat less2. Walk 30 minutes a day3. Don't eat junk food4. Drink more waterThere you have it.
5,"Insightful, cleverly written book about the body.","This book helped explain, in everyday language, how our body reacts to everything we eat, good and bad. Instead of simply telling you to diet and exercise, it reiterates the positive consequences from doing so, chemically, physically, and emotionally. I like that it explained how will power alone will never get you to lose weight and keep it off."
5,You: On A Diet: The Owner's Manual for Waist Management,"A very humorous look at the ""way to eat"", to take care, maintain and trim your body for life.Very, very informative and easy to comprehend!"
3,Good - But a little too much physiological information,"Written well for layperson, but a litte to much technical info on bodily functions. Has good recipes and provides food shopping list to get you started on your diet."
2,Nicotine Gum & Coffee??,"I was thinking this was a pretty informative book. Somewhat corny humor, but still good. UNTIL I got to the end where they talk about weight loss medications. I couldn't believe they recommended chewing nicotine gum and drinking two cups of coffee as their ""Waist Management Cocktail."" Nicotine is a highly addictive drug and the gum can be just as addictive as cigarettes or chewing tobacco. As a hypnotist, people have come to me for help with these addictions. I think this is irresponsible advice coming from a doctor. For this reason, I would NOT recommend this book for teenagers."
3,Good info but very diificult to locate grocery items,"I adore Dr. Oz and watch Oprah every time he appears on her show. This book is very informative and really puts the focus where it should be..on your health not your weight. However, when I took his grocery list and went shopping it took 3 grocery stores,over $250.00 and there wasn't a lot of food in the basket. Plus, I still didn't have everything thing on the grocery list. The bill at GNC was $50.00 and I didn't get all the vitimins and supplements he recommends you take! It was very frustrating at best trying to locate the food items he listed. It wasn't written for folks on a limited budget."
5,You On A Diet,"I haven't finished reading the book yet. So far, it's excellent. It is very thorough with the explanation of the various functions of the organs. I'm very satisfied."
3,It's O.K.,"I don't think there is anything new in this book. You have to cut calories, stay away from fast food restaurants, and do some kind of exercise in order to lose weight. It doesn't really matter what kind of diet you are on as long as you eat small portions and exercise. And I did not have to pay one penny to learn that!!"
4,All you would want to know.,This audio book is informative. There are some sections that you lose some interest but the two doctors really cover everything from how your system works to what to put in it. They really are covering all bases and trying to show how everything is connected. I found it very good and pretty much what I expected.
2,Too Cute,I didn't expect such condescending `cuteness' from these doctors. Good info if you can stomach the writing.
2,There is nothing new about any of us being on a diet,"While well packaged for information, any one who has ever tried to lose those last five pounds should know by now, ALL DIET BOOKS boil it down to:Eat modestlyExercise lightlyAnd as I have read so many of them, hoping that would be kismet, I am being honest in my review...Even the information on measuring waistband instead of charting weight has made it into popular magazines long before now...The recipes are not new...and like most of these books, to make up for the fact that your food will have no flavor, you are given ""Low fat,carb, insulin resistent"" or other recipes with 50 ingredients, most of which must be ordered around the globe...What this book has done for me is help hear the sounding of a clarion bell that I am tired of my life wearing me...I would rather wear my life...even with 5 extra pounds!"
4,Are you a doubter? And are you serious about your waist?,"I don't believe in diets, and I have never bought a diet book. Perhaps this book is not as helpful for those who have ""heard it all before."" But as I get older, my average weight has become harder to maintain, and I didn't just want to ""give in"" and keep buying new clothes. For me, it was ""try this book"" or ""join Weight Watchers.""Not the most exciting reading, but an incredibly helpful reference -- I found myself tabbing pages. The title is misleading, because the book is not about dieting, per se, but about eating healthy and making better food choices. After getting through the book, I think I have better expectations about my weight and about dieting, I understand a little more about food, portions, and weight loss and gain. This book does not sell rock-hard abs or dancer's thighs. It really just sells health, and I appreciated that.Oh, and I have lost 6 pounds since I finished the book in February."
2,Chapter 6 - The Sex Factor - Progestin? Are you kidding?,"The Sex Factor: The last sentence on page 134 reads, ""Now, estrogen works great when it gets paired up with, or balanced by, another ovarian messenger called progestin, which gets released from the egg sac (called corpus luteum) after the follicle ships out its egg.""Give me a break! My female body has never produced a drop of progestin in my entire life! Don't Doctors Roizen and Oz know the difference between progestin and progesterone? Does anybody who helped edit this book know the difference?I'm disappointed to have found this mistake, and I'm wondering how many other mistakes there are, and how seriously I should take this book?From a woman who knows the difference between progestin and progesterone."
2,"unintelligible, cluttered, counterproductive, confusing","As others have said:- All of the cutsie expressions (and useless asides in parentheses), made it almost impossible to distill the actual content of the book.- Too wordy.- All the references to junk food made me want to eat it!Also:- Pictures/illustrations often did not seem to link with the text that explained them.Overall, I wasn't able to understand as much as I wanted to about the physiology of being fat.I'm giving this 2 starts instead of 1, as I was able to glean a couple of useful items to incorporate into my routine.Best diet book I've used is by Dr Barbara Edelstein. Published in '77, so some parts are a bit dated, but most of it holds up today. Some of her hunches from experience have since been proved through science, and she has a unique perspective on overweights that I haven't heard elsewhere."
5,A Healthy homerun,"I am a health coach for a weight management company. This book affirms what we do, which is get people healthy, safely and without nonsense. I am impressed that early in the book the authors addressed the info that chemicals are released/present in the body of overweight people. It takes ""guilt"" out of the equation, which is long overdue. This book is a must read because it discusses waist management in a non-techincal but entertaining way. It combines the latest research, putting it all together. With over 2/3 of our society in the overweight to morbidly obese range, medical professionals need to be stepping up to the plate without the pressure from the doggoned drug companies. It is not so much about ""looking good"" anymore as much as it is about one's HEALTH!!!!"
5,Awesome,"This book was really wonderful to me. It was incredibly informative which has made all the difference in the world!! Sometimes I didn't quite understand all the details, but I got the bigger picture. I recommend this book to anyone that wants to learn how food really works in your body as a way to get healthy."
3,You on a Diet.,"You'd better be ready to diet! This is a book about changing your lifestyle, not just losing weight. I don't know what I'm looking for, exactly - but I'm pretty sure this isn't it!"
4,Finally! A diet that's rational!,"I've read this book front to back and thoroughly enjoyed it. The lifestyle advice that Dr. Oz recommends makes sense, works with you instead of against you. My only complaint is the options given for morning and midday meals are a little limited in the preparation time needed. He makes no suggestions really regarding sandwiches in particular, which is a tough spot for me. I tend to eat at a cafe every day that in general serves very healthy food. I'm just not sure what's preferable from what they serve.All that whining aside, this is a very good, sensible, plan for getting back on track health-wise and the book ""You: The Owner's Manual"" makes for an excellent companion and has it's own list of recipes and food ideas that compliments this one very well."
4,Helpful,I enjoyed listening to these CD's and will review them again at a later date. It includes some very sound advice.
3,Very Informative,"The new fad in diet books is the whole ""it's not your fault"" statement. This is the 2nd book I've personally read with that statement in it. It makes me a bit weary now, I think maybe ""it's not your fault"" and ""it's not about willpower"" might be the new marketing methods of diet pimps.Anyways, the book is a good read. Some of the humor is dry, and forced. It's a little too much too. Then the explainations of how hormones are created in your body is a bit over the top too. It was necessary information, but I don't think all THAT detail really matters. Do I really need to know where in my body leptin is produced, in what quantities, where it goes from there, etc? Couldn't they just say ""your digestive system then creates leptin, which controls ... "" and be done with it?"
3,Good stepping stone,If you are eating the Standard American Diet (SAD) and you don't know where or how to start improving your health and your lifestyle...then this is a great place to start. Very easy to read and understand.
3,You: ON A DIET: THE OWNER'S MANUAL FOR WAIST MANAGEMENT,TOO MANY COMEDIC LINES--NEEDED TO GET TO THE POINT WITHOUT ALL THE FUNNIES.THE INFO IS GOOD WHEN YOU CAN REMEMBER IT AFTER THE FUNNY LINES.
3,"Good science, terrible writing","If you are interested in human physiology and weight, this is the kind of book you have to read at least once very ten years because of the advancing science. But in a relentless, and tiresome, effort to be folksy, the authors bury the science, and the good advice, in an avalanche of cutesy words and metaphors. And the introduction to every topic is (or feels as if it is) much longer than the substance of the topic, itself. All the key ideas are there, somewhere, but eventually I just gave up trying to dig them up. It's a shame, really."
2,Popular but weak on details,"Dr. Oz is great in his ability to deliver information in a fun and popular manner. Unfortunately this book is full of cute explanations that actually leaves people more confused than delivering the scientific facts. Worse though is some misinformation (Examples: page 136 has a list of blood test levels - the first TSH advises ""less than 5"" when it should be less than 2.2; Page 98 implies Sucralose, Aspartame and Saccharin are ok for you yet scares you away from the best choice of the list: Stevia).Hopefully this book will help a lot of people improve their health. Unfortunately I can't recommend it as a good source of facts about nutrition (actually it may cause some harm by spreading false information). Don't trust medical doctors for information on nutrition. Do your own research.The main message is great though: eat healthier and exercise, lose excess weight and you'll do wonders for your health."
2,STUPID,"I thought this book would be professional and interesting. Instead it is filled with horrible jokes and horrible little pop culture antedotes, that it is practically unreadable."
2,same info new cover,"I was disappointed in the content of this book. Its really the same info in a new cover with humor that soon becomes monotonous, repetitive and condescending. There are no new medical breakthroughs in this book! The basic premise is this - eat less - exercise more- sound familiar? The diet plan is very similar to weight watchers. The only information in this book that surprised me were the chapters on using diet drugs, getting weight loss surgery and/or liposuction! These must be the ""new ideas"" that these 2 cardiologists are promoting. The book gets 1 star from me because it was a good buy from Amazon...not so much money wasted on yet another New Year's diet book."
2,"Insulting, but worthwhile in spite of that.","This book has an incredible wealth of information that I found very helpful,and will likely put into use right away.However, I felt intellectually assulted and personally insulted by the writing style. This author seems to think that the way to appeal to those struggling with weight is to compile a bunch of juvenile fat jokes and insert them where ever they will fit into this book. Comments such as ""waist the size of Neptune"" are just insulting on more than one level! I'm pretty certain this author has never personally struggled with weight."
1,Disappointed,I was disappointed in this book. It had too much information on the body structure. This book will bore you to eat. I did not finish the book because it is more for a doctor than a patient>
3,I'm going to buy this book,"A book on this topic is urgent. As an endocrinologist, I deal with the problem of waistlines a lot and public awareness is too low to get the patient to my attention in time to prevent the metabolic syndrome. We'd have less diabetics if we paid enough attention to their body shapes.Interesting how people estimate the authors' humor quality :) -- but without reading it's impossible to tell. I rate the neutral 3 stars because my opinion is on the theme and not the book. I'm going to re-vote after I read!"
1,NOTHING NEW...IT'S STILL COUNTING CALORIES & EXERCISING!,"It still amounts to counting calories and exercising, so what's new? This new book is informative about how the body works and which foods to eliminate, but really that's about it! Nothing new from the standpoint of losing weight! If you want a weight loss program that not only causes weight loss, BUT KEEPS IT OFF, look up LET'S DO LUNCH (letsdolunch)...you eat until you're full whenever you're hungry, and Let's Do Lunch eliminates all of your cravings, while you're eating all the healthy starchy carbs you want, along with all the lean red meat and sweetest fresh fruits and fruit smoothies you want, and without counting calories, carbs, points or anything else."
2,Enough with the cliches!,"""Healthy choices that become as automatic as a Simon Cowell barb""?? ""We don't want you to think that exercise must involve sweating like a waterfall and panting like an obscene caller""?? This is the authoring team's best stab at ""signature wit and wisdom""?? These cliches, and about 1/2 dozen or so ones like them per page, pepper the book, rendering it almost unreadable. I was so distracted by the very un-funny and prosaic writing style, that I believe it truly detracts from the importance of the information. Had I been able to view the book and sample a page or two of the doctors' hack writing before buying, I probably wouldn't have purchased it in the first place. I know there is valuable information and an important message here, but it is overshadowed by the unsuccessful attempts at entertaining the audience. Just stick with the facts guys, and don't quit your day jobs. And while you're at it, please fire your (obviously incompetent) editor."
2,"For Once, Oprah was Wrong","I bought this book hoping that it was going to help me understand more about how my body works with food and how to shed a few extra pounds. I found that it was very hard to follow with analogy after analogy and one comparison after the next. I felt that the authors got so wrapped up in trying to make the book sound simple and easy to follow with comparisons to common things. But they took it so far out there and to such an extreme that I couldn't even remember what I was reading about in the first place. I'm sorry, but I was expecting a lot more out of this book. I consider myself pretty knowledgeable in the field of health and fitness and this book did nothing for me. And the illustrations were kind of scary rather than helpful."
2,You: On a Diet:,I can't rate this because I don't remember purchasing this item. I will have to research to see if I actually do have the book
5,Great buy,"I havent read it yet, but it is motivation for me to start and be successful at dieting!! Dr. Oz is wonderful"
1,be wary,"As much as I tried to like this book, it simply struck me as incredibly derivative of so many other best-selling 'Weight Loss' books that have come down the pike the past 20 years. How many times can the ""eat healthy foods and exercise regularly"" message be repackaged? I'm surprised that so many people seem to think that buying this (or one of the literally dozens of other similar books on the market) will provide something in the way of a ""new and improved"" way to lose weight. Don't kid yourself, buying and reading a book isn't going to help unless you do indeed only eat healthy foods and exercise regularly."
1,Don't Buy This Book,"Even at Kindle prices, this was a waste of money. Just more of the same stuff. And, please note that I gave this one star only because it wouldn't upload without something in that space."
4,Great,"Great advise for getting in shape. Some of the explanations were a little long winded, but overall good read."
5,insightful,this book was very informative and insightful. This book educates you toward the way the body functions in a very delightful way. The Doctor puts humor on a tough subject and makes it easy to digest (no pun intended) The illustrations are so funny. Now I know what food continues to make me hungry and I know how to make the food exchange. Dr. Oz answers the questions and gives you the direction to reduce waist management. Great gift idea for anyone whom is serious about their health.
1,It Could Be a 3rd Grade Text Book,"While ""easy to read,"" it is almost so easy as to insult the reader's intelligence. The illustrations are hideously ugly and infantile, and the non-stop analogies become tiresome after page 5 of the introduction. While the book does explain, in painstaking detail, the science of digestion and metabolism, if you have even a rudimentary knowledge of same, don't waste your time. At least wait until to book is out on paperback so you don't waste money."
4,Good read,"Jam-packed full of easy to understand information that will change the way you look at food. The book is a great read, however I marked this as 4 stars because I was very disappointed with the website they kept referring to within the book. The website was not very useful, and confusing/poorly designed at best.The recipes in the book are pretty good -- some much better than others. I would have liked to have seen more vegetarian options and information but all in all it is a really nicely done book."
3,You on a Diet,"A timely book with an important message to convey. Yikes, the cartoons and over the top corny humor (I couldn't read one more ""jelly donut"" joke)made this an extremely tedious way to glean the author's intent. Just give me the straight 411, thank you. I skimmed this book mostly. The shopping list was helpful as was the menu info."
3,On A diet,"It was a okay book, it didn't really keep myself and husband's full attention. It had very good illistrations and a nice sense of humor behind it. It could of made the beginning of it a little more motivating or capturing."
2,Disappointed,I thought this book did not offer any new information we have not heard before. I also thought it spent too much time discussing the medical side of losing weight rather than focusing on the practical ways.
4,You: On A Diet: The Owner's Manual for Waist Management,"This book is well written and entertaining yet informative. There are lots of diet books out there that just don't offer realistic long-term plans for weight loss. This book doesn't just illustrate a quick fix, it offers real advice for maintaining a healthy weight/size throughout your life."
4,It works. Now I've got to quit sounding like a commercial...,"This book has been hugely successful for a reason. IT WORKS. I'm getting over sounding like a weight-loss commercial finally after losing eighty pounds of fat in large part due to the very easy to apply principles of this book and a bit of work. While it's not the only fitness book you should own, it does help make the complex systems of the body simple to understand. I loan my copy out frequently now, because once learned, the principles don't require constant review.I must say that the author's writing style is at many times very annoying. The constant pop-culture references and jokes cease being funny after the fiftieth time, and that's just in the first chapter. I waded through it though, in bits and pieces, and followed the directions, and lost fat. Excellent program that is fairly easy to apply if you're motivated to actually apply it and break a few bad habits."
3,Audio book poorly produced,"I am a big fan of Dr. OZ and all of the You books.I recently purchased the You on a diet audio CD. I am very very disappointed that Dr. Roizen was reading it as well. He is worst reader I have ever heard. He sounds very creepy and it completely spoils the book. Please please, in the future if you decide to publish audio books, do not have Dr. Roizen read it."
2,You On a Diet,"pages were too busy for me...had trouble following...reminded me of books out of the ""Idiots/Dummies"" series.."
2,You On a Diet,"It is pretty much a rehash of their ""You A Owners Manual"" with a couple of chapters thrown in for dieting."
2,You: On a Diet,"This book presents, in a fun and easy to read format, how your body functions and processes food. I found that portion of the book to be very interesting and informative; however, to follow the suggested diet which is very constricting, and would mean, in most cases, that one empty their entire kitchen, and refrigerator of all food, spices, drinks, etc. currently residing there, and replenish with the very specific, earthy items listed in the book is crazy.While I understand a change in eating habits is needed to become healthier, I found this diet to be extreme, and would eventually set folks up to fail because it is so way out there.I will keep the book as a reference to the processing of food through the body and will definitely not even attempt to follow the recommended diet."
3,mediocre,"The book has a few good points, but you have to dig for them in amongst all the lame attempts at humor. It would have been about half the length it currently is if they could have eliminated the bull and just written the book."
4,Worth the read,"The book comes off a little goofy and with pop culture references it tries to be too cool but the message is clear and easy to read and most importantly the ""diet"" works. I understand more about what my body is doing, why I think ice cream for supper sounds good and how to avoid that kind of behavior. I also now believe deeply in the power of a handful of almonds. This book teaches you to reprogram your habits and thinking and leaves some room for you to actually eat food. If you aren't afraid of the produce aisle and purchasing a good pair of walking shoes you can do this too."
2,A book spoilt by distractions,"If like me, you hate people who keep interjecting jokes when you are trying to have a serious discussion, you will probably not like this book. I found the author's use of humor did nothing to make a complex subject lighter or more understandable - it was simply a huge distraction. I would have preferred an attempt to use simple but relevant analogies to illustrate a point. Even the illustrations are like comics.I think the actual content is probably really good but I'm afraid it's still sitting around my house waiting to be finished."
1,You On A Diet: the Owner's Manual for Waist Management,I was very disappointed with this book. I may have picked out a couple of things I could use but for the most part it was very boring reading. They just rambled on and on until I just put the book down. I think maybe surgeons just stick to surgery instead of trying to write. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone -- it's a waste of your money and time reading.
1,Wizard of Oz Diet Book Full of Truthiness and Other Factoids.,"Sad commentary on two docs writing out of their field to capture a frustrated nation of dieters. It's a very jazzy Dr Seuss type book on dieting ,nutrition and exercise full of name dropping references to hormones, miracle dietary supplements and pop science. Don't these docs know the definition of ""factoid"" which they sprinkle throughout their book? What's next a book on dieting by a Proctologist- ""The Owner's Manual for Waste Management?"
1,Waste of money,This book did not deliver. I followed it down to the letter for three weeks and lost a pound. Wow.
2,rambles,This rambles on and it makes it difficult to read. There may be good information but it is difficult to focus and find it.
1,you on a diet,Good practical information. Follow it and you WILL loose weight and feel better! I did!
2,Thank god I didn't buy it,"I picked this up at a friends house and flipped through it. I had to laugh out loud. Ya...no kidding...eat right, in moderation, etc., etc. Now, for all you potential dieters who think you need to buy another book about dieting when the other 12 books you bought didn't help...here's my advice to you: STOP EATING CHIPS AND CANDY. GET UP OFF YOUR BUTT AND EXCERCISE.There. I have just unveiled the ""secrets"" contained in this book.Now order something interesting to read and stop beating yourself up over being fat."
3,Oprah says this works.....but....,"I haven't really given this a full chance...a bit ""cutsie"" in it's writing, but makes sense.....I just need to get with it!"
5,You On A Diet,Anyone & everyone that is serious about losing weight should read this book. It is information that you may have never heard before and it's removes the old school of thought regarding what you should and souldn't do to rid your body of excess fat.
2,"Too Advanced Biology Lesson, Lacks Practical Advice and Recipes","Being boilogically challenged, I found this book a hard read. Although I read it cover-to-cover, I only derived small portions that were of practical use. What good is it to know how the body works if there are only a few real-life solutions to weight gain? The recipies are impossible. The constant references to TV programs were hard to swallow and did noting to enhance the lessons. I will not purchase books from these authors again and do not recommend it to anyone wanting practical advice on losing weight."
2,"You, on a Diet",Boring - no better than most diet books. This is a long drawn out waste of money that in no got me motivated.
5,You on a Diet - hardcover,Easy read...informational with a humorous twist. A sensible plan you can really follow for the long term.
3,A different approach,This book has a different idea about dieting. It starts by telling you what happens to food in your body when you eat. A lot of it helps explain where the fat comes from. I found out some new information and I think I've read every diet book there is.
4,You on a Diet,i have enjoyed the research in this book. The basic facts are ones that you don't always think about and it makes you think about your daily eating habits.
2,not as good as on tv,"I love dr. Oz on tv, but do not care for this book. I feel like it is full of a lot of filler and the substantial info is hard to understand."
3,Slow at beginning but good information overall,Almost annoying at first with its tempo....too elementary. Then lots of the technical stuff....the diet itself is sound and does work. It is a healthy lifestyle. Still using the book as a reference but unable to make myself read the thing straight through.
3,Didn't do a thing for me.,"The book starts out with how your body works and how it burns fat. I thought it was very basic. Basically, I thought it was saying cut down on calories and exercise. I wasn't impressed."
4,very informative,You: On A Diet: The Owners Manual for Waist Management was a very helpful and informative book. Had it just for a couple weeks and it is starting to change my life for the better. Very helpful with the menus they are great.
4,Good information,"I have not finished the book but consider it quite good by teaching nutrition and body facts in a systematic way. To be able to understand how it actually works behind the scene is always better for me than to follow those ""10 tips"" from magazines.I read many of the reviews before buying the book and was already prepared for the overdone humor. Actually it's not that bad. However like many books of this kind, the authors spent a lot of time defending their methods and attacking others, which doesn't seem to be necessary when repeated so many times ..."
1,"""You On A Diet""","I found the book a little too flip throughout. Since the book is so filled with the authors' attempts to entertain, the message is very often lost, or has to be sought for. The basic information would be more easily accessed and put into action, if it were not so difficult to glean out of all the jokes, etc. I could not even finish reading it -- too time-consuming to locate the information necessary to follow the diet plan."
4,You: On A Diet: The Owner's Manual for Waist Management,"This book is written in a breezy style that's easy to understand. It takes some complicated material and distills it down to layman's terms while injecting humor, making it fun to read. At the same time I found myself thinking ""When are they going to get to the heart (no pun intended) of the book?"" I was tempted to skip ahead, but decided that maybe I needed to know the underlying science, so enjoyed the jokes and spoofs while I learned some facts about nutrition, exercise as well as psychology. I've actually lost some weight."
5,Everyone SHOULD own this one,"Even if you never go one a diet, you need to review this book. Just learning how your body works makes you want to take better care of this wonderful body we have. I thought I knew how my body works but there are things in this book that I never knew...but I do now. If you want to grow old gracefully, and we are all going to grow old, read this book now and do take good care of your body. These Doctors know exactly what they are talking about. It's very easy reading and very worth the time and effort."
2,Disappointed in You--Diet,"Too wordy; Took too long to get any useful info. Maybe great for some, but I suspect most 'professional' dieters will not find this book useful."
1,Just What the World Needs....,"Just what the world needs...ANOTHER diet book that tells us we can't eat any sugar at all if we want to be thin. Just once I would like someone to write a book that says having a sweet treat occasionally is okay! I believe Americans eat way too much sugar, but complete abstinence? Sorry, I don't buy it. Leave it to men to advocate sex, but no sugar. I hope these docs write a book about a good for you form of birth control too because we'll need it with all this good for you sex. Personally, I think sugar and sex are ""Even Steven"". Although the book makes some good points (no trans fats, adequate sleep), the sugar thing ruins it."
2,"A ""Gotcha"" book","I got caught, did you? Oprah puts them on her show and everyone believes this is the bible and the truth. All they're doing is telling you to diet, watch what you eat, and exercise, BUT, the main thing they tell you, ""be afraid."" If yu're overweight and this doesn't wotk, you need surgery, according to them. Typical Doctor fear-driven advice. Don't buy this, or the other ""You"" books unless you want the same kind of deception Trudeau gave you. Their fear tactics are sly and insidious. I saw the Oprah show where Oz aske dher if she had cancer wouldn't she want surgery right away. She said YES. Not me. I've had it with gus like this capitalizing on people's fear. Go to A. Weil, or R. M. Gangi. Learn about your body in a truthful, loving way, and you'll not only lose weight, you won't be afraid to be imperfect."
1,Here is an idea on how to lose weight....,"Eat less. Use that money you want to blow on this book, and invest it. No BOOK is going to make it all better. Here is the simple truth:1. Eat slower. chew your food slower. So when you are full, you have eaten less. and portions are CRAZY these days. I order the kids menu guys. Even that portion is sickening at some restaurants.2. Exercise. Nothing crazy. Walk, do a few crunches...3. If you eat when you are mad, sad or some other emotion, you need to tell your Doctor. You have an eating disorder, and need to possibly be put on an anti-depressant--(I know, they suck), or maybe you have some medical issues (Diabetes, etc.)Those are the things that will work. Not wasting more money on Diet Books -- Do you KNOW how many there are out there? Do you know why people write them? Because they know they sell. Don't fall for it yet again.Dan"
5,You: On A Diet,Funny and informative book about the bodily processes when it comes to food intake. Helped make sense of why certain foods would ultimately make me tired by 3pm. Bought book to eat healthier and keep up with my four kids. Has done that and more. The food is more flavorful that I choose and I am more energetic and have trimmed down in the waist area.
2,Overrated,Eat less of the right foods. Vegies and lean meat and no trans fat and of course excercise. There you have it. There some interesting tid bits on how the body works but this could have been explained in half the time they took to explain and fill with fluff. Better if you have never ready any book on the topic.
2,"Same old, same old.","I couldn't get into this book. This is the same concept as every other diet book I've read, and the graphics get really irritating. I'm actually thinking of selling it."
2,Not an expert,"Honestly, it's just more than I will ever do. I don't cook and I can't ever see myself following what is in the book."
2,"too much sarcasm, too many stupid analogies","I am about half-way through this book and haven't learned anything. I've never read a book about dieting before, so maybe I don't understand the genre. With this book, I cannot concentrate on what I'm reading because the authors are so busy trying to be funny through sarcasm and analogies. The illustrations are terrible. If readers are looking for helpful information on a subject they take seriously, this is not the book."
2,In a Round About Way,"Basically, this diet is the low Glycemic Index diet, but they get to it in a real round about way and don't get into too much detail about that part. If you just want to get to the part that cleary states what you can and should not eat, and great recipes and guidelines and brief synopsis about they whys and exercise then try any of Rick Gallop's Low GI books - they are EXCELLENT and provide excellent EXTENSIVE guides for good foods to eat so that you don't starve and can eat on a consistent basis without getting bored or giving up flavor!"
3,You on a Diet: the owner's manual for waist management,"Expensive food choices, not easy to follow for ""busy"" people. Gives you a lot of info on how the body works. Informative though."
1,Ugh. Insulting and trite.,"Fortunately, I checked this out from the library instead of spending money on it. I couldn't even manage to read it, let alone figure out what they were trying to suggest.I found the constant insulting analogies extremely off-putting. Really, if you're trying to encourage people to lose weight and let go of the all-or-nothing beliefs that lead many people to give up after the first slip, then you should reconsider slipping an insult into every other sentence.Absolute junk. Send your copy straight to the recycle bin."
3,Dieting - who doesn't,"There is not many diet books that I manage to read from cover to cover, but this one is different. It is easy to read, easy to follow and understand. Unlike many other types of books written by Doctors this one speaks in plain language for everyone to follow and you don't need a medical or nursing degree to understand the explanations of how the body and its systems work. For a diet book it is very well set out and easy to read.Most importantly so easy to do and stick to."
2,You: On a diet: the Owner's Manual for Waist Management,Lost interest about 1/2 way through book. Seems to take a long time to get to actual diet.
2,Nothing special!,I am donating this book to our local library. I didn't find it anything special. A rehashing of things we (anyone who diets and follows diets) doesn't already have knowledge of.
5,Highly recommended!,"Since getting serious about learning what my body needs, I have read a lot of books, done a lot of research, and found the Dr Oz segments on Oprah to be shocking and informative.I've been asked to write a 6-week community-based program to help others lose/gain weight and regain health to their bodies, and in many cases, mind and emotions. Where do you start? I decided to buy this book to glean helpful tips and help consolidate what I have learnt... and hopefully pick up some things I might have missed along the way. It's doing all that. Some of the humour I will have to modify for local tastes, but fat is fat whatever country you are in around the world.I'd recommend that everyone read this book, but I know that won't happen, so - if you are disheartened, pushed about, worn down, exhausted, criticised and condemed by the constant pressure to diet, consider this your passport to a healthier life and healthier body!"
4,Weight loss book,So far I am enjoying the book. There is lots of great information about getting healthy and losing weight.
5,Top Pick,"This is a no nonsense book that educated me on why I should eliminate ""bad food""...with a splash of humor. Once I understood my intestinal and digestive system ( with idiot friendly terms )and how to balance my system, it was easy to make just a few changes that has had dramatic results quickly. I felt lethargic and had alot of joint pain. I ate to reduce inflamation in my system and the pain went away. I feel energetic and I'm back in the gym and slimming down. WOO-HOO!"
4,common sense book a little boring,"This is a good book. It is basic common sense and is easy to follow. It is a little boring though it goes into very detailed description of medical reasons why we are fat from the things we eat. I would highly recommend it if you are prepared to give up white flour, sugar and junk food. It is also written with a bit of humor to make up for the boring parts!"
1,Kindle Version Unreadable,I had to be refunded for this book on the Kindle Reader. Many sections of the book appear to have charts or columns that went off the screen no matter what size font I chose on the Kindle.
3,Sounds easier than it is,"I found this book interesting and I did gain a few tips I can use. However, as a sugar addict, it is not so easy to just not eat sugar. And I rarely eat because I a hungry. Instead I eat just because I feel like it, or I'm bored, or stressed, etc. This book doesn't address any of those issues or how to avoid emotional eating. The book seems to be targeted to obese people as they say you can lose a few inches in your waist in the first week. And the recipes assume you have lots of leisurely time to cook."
5,You: On A Diet: The Owner's Manual for Waist Management,"This is a great book. Different and much more enlightning than any other ""diet"" book that I have read. I love the education I have gotten about the body. I would highly recommend this book to anyone looking to know more about how their system works and/or is wanting to loose some weight and keep it off."
4,Human-behaviour,"In Huit-Clos, Jean-Paul Sartre makes an analysis of human-behaviour. The scene takes place in a cell where three people are faced with each other. The reader is immediatly impregnated of different personalities and understands the fears of each one to stay eternaly together because, like Jean-Paul Sartre concludes: ""The hell is others."""
2,Disappointing compared to its superior predecessors,"A stilted variation on the previous books in this excellent series. I found it difficult to become interested, as for once Cook's easy writing style seems to have deserted him. While this one disappoints, Cook's track record with this series is good enough that I will be eagerly lining up to buy the next in the series."
1,So bad it went to the used book store as soon as I finished,"""Beer and a Shot"" book. The writing is done in extremely short chapters,a page to seven or eight. It reads as if the writer sat down, poured adrink, worked until the drink ran out, and then stopped until the nextday. The first few Garrett books were imaginative and fun, an interestingmixture of Chandler and fantasy. The series has run its course, however,and it seems time to end it. Garrett the P.I. would have smelled this one amile away and flushed it."
3,photos,the book is overpriced and the photographs were not terribly interesting. pictures should have shown more factory work and more interesting professions.
4,Bought the album for one song...,"To be honest, I bought this album for one song ""Overshadow Me"" and the version on this album was not the version I originally heard, so I was somewhat disappointed, but it is still a good praise and worship album to have.I would recommend it."
5,when women worship,"The packaging was like new,the CD played like new. This is a worship cd I had owned before and lost, so I already knew howgood it was. Awesome worship, great soaking. I'm so happy to own it once again. Love it"
5,Word Productions,"There I was in Georgia, helping my daughter with the opening of a hotel..sitting in her car while she shopped. She had a CD in...and soon, I found myself touched by God...next weeping. I said ""What is this?"" She said she received it as a gift. It is from heaven..that's where it is from.I have a ministry...teaching and music, and have sung professionally and on worship teams. I have produced books, my own and for others..have a prayer ministry...have longed to feel the presence of God while music plays. In the Jesus Movement [my beginnings] that happened. Thank you Jesus for this album..now, I own it, my sister owns it..and a group of girls and women are going to do a few of the songs for our church.To God be all the glory...I am so delighted in what God has done and is doing in this album."
2,When Women Worship CD,"I loved the CD, but do not send me a used messed up one. Very tacky! Shame on Warehouse Deals, Inc. Especially if you are supposedly Christian, do other Christians right!"
4,Excellent collection.,"Another Rainbow Quartz winner (they have so many). If the second half of the cd was as good as the first, I'd offer 5 stars. These Spanish guys make classic pop/rock in the vein of all your favorites in this genre. The first half of the cd is really spot on; take your pick of singles; Every Day, Breaking the Ice, In My Garden, Messages Inside. One of the best releases of 2003."
1,Do not recommend,"I would not recommend this book to help one study for the ANCC Psychiatric-Mental Health CNS exam. It is outdated in content (except Freud of course), I disagreed with many of the rationales for the answers. Perhaps, due to the outdated approaches to mental health."
1,Not true Christmas Trivia,This game is only for someone who watches movies 24/7. Most of the questions are about actors and actresses. It needs a new description!I will not purchase any games by this company and if I could still return the item I would.
5,The best children's book of Norse mythology...ever!,"This book was the first, and to date best, book of Norse mythology I read. I single-handedly read my third grade teacher's copy to pieces, along with the D'Aulaire book of Greek mythology. The beautiful illustrations stuck in my head, and have become permantly associated with the stories. I was influenced so much that I am now studying to be a professional medievalist, with a particular emphasis in Germanic/Northern European literature. The D'Aulaire books are a must have for any parent, teacher, or lover of mythology. Hopefully the publishers will re-print this book so we can all afford it!"
5,Norse Gods and Giants,"Like so many other readers, I remember this as the first book I ever read in school. The Norse gods were nothing like their immortal counterparts in Greek and Roman mythology--they were true heros who knew their days were numbered, yet fought valiantly against malevolent forces until the bitter end. The D'Aulaires spin these heroic myths into abridged tales that will certainly enthrall any youngster and leave them asking for more. I attribute, almost exclusively, my lifelong love of reading to this book. In fact, some years back I was able to purchase a copy of the book, which had been autographed by the authors. I paid a sizeable sum, but now proudly display the copy on my bookshelf for all to see. I guess the only downside is that I cherish the book so much, I don't let my own children look at it without me being present!"
5,SOMEBODY PRINT THIS BOOK PLEASE!!!,"I haven't read this book yet...but that's because I can't find it anywhere...I DO, however, LOVE the Greek mythology book...by FAR, the best mythology book I've ever found for ALL ages! Thus, the 5 star rating for this one...cuz I know it's gonna be just as good...heh...seems we need a petition to get the publisher to re-print this one...my Greek mythology book is getting lonely!!"
3,Not Free SF Reader,"A reasonably gentle and good introduction to Norse mythology, with some pictures to add to the entertainment. Here you get the stories of Odin, of Thor and Loki. Not to mention Baldur, Sif, Loki, Heimdall and all the goings on with giants, dwarves, magic weapons, frost giants and at the end the whole Ragnarok thing."
2,Not as good as their reputation,"I bought a couple of these through an independent seller, but I gave one away as a gift. The one that I kept for myself works just ok...it randomly skips sections of about 1 second when playing back mp3 CDs. If the disc is replayed, it never skips again in the same locations. This leads me to conclude that the player is faulty. I bought it for 2 reasons: first is because I've only ever heard great things about all eclipse products and second because the player was only $50. It's not worth replacing, but kinda funny when passengers notice the skip."
5,Awesome Insights,This book is awesome! I appreciate the way Stoops is able to show the positive side to life. It is life changing. I have bought copies for my friends.
4,Excellent motivational book that is a quick read.,Mr Stoops presents his motivational thoughts in a clear concise format that is a quick read for anyone who is looking for an inspirational book. His common sense strategies and down to earth comments on life make this the perfect companion to deal with everyday life.
4,Engaging Historical Romance,"This historical romance has all the ingredients for a winner: a strong heroine, a brave but tormented hero, and a villain who would take all from them. Lady Alisoun's life has been threatened by Osbern, the king's champion and cousin. She hires Sir David to protect her, knowing his fearsome reputation will keep her foe away. Too late, she discovers that Osbern is the knight who defeated Sir David in the latest tournament. Now who will save her? I liked the tormented hero and how he rises to the challenge of defeating his enemy in the end."
2,Drudgery at best.,"I'm still trying to get through this book. Her heroines leave much to be desired. Where is the intrigue? Where is the much needed battle of wills? Where is the chase? SAdly, not in this novel."
3,Lukewarm story,"A slow and often difficult read. But don't mistake that to mean I didn't enjoy this book. It had all the elements of a great medieval epic; descriptive setting, action, a hero who works his way into your heart, and interesting minor characters such as Edlyn, Phillipa, Eudo and Sir Walter whom you grow to care about too. It was the heroine I couldn't warm up to, quite frankly because she was so icy and never seemed to truly thaw out, not even in the passioante scenes with the hero."
2,an ok book.,Well this was the first book I've ever read by Christina Dodd. It won't be the last because I did enjoy it but it didn't thrill me. I found it to be humorous in some spots and down right boring in others. I liked the hero and the author really developed him well. The heroine left a lot to be desired. She was a cold fish and even during the love scenes I didn't think she thawed any. I also found this story a bit hard to follow at times. It seemed like the conversation would start and stop at the weirdest times and lines seemed to be out of place. I did like the secondary characters in this book and would be interested in reading future books with their stories. Like I said I enjoyed it but it could have been a lot better
5,"A warm, realistic romance that is intelligent & entertaining","I thoroughly enjoyed this story; there was none of the anochronistic internal dialogue that so often occurs in historical romances. The heroine was not the ridiculous, pouty (ineffectual)""little hellcat"" that permeates the genre. She is a powerful woman who has lived her life in a society where women are afforded little protection and fewer rights. Some readers may be disappointed that there are no heated exchanges of bombastic, empty threats and no quasi-rape a la Kathleen Woodwiss. Too bad. I liked the slow, deep development of intimacy, the gradual unveiling of tenderness and comittment that bespeaks true romance whatever the time period. An excellent, fun story that (a real shock to me) my husband read and enjoyed!"
5,Lonely Planet Watching Wildlife: East Africa,"I recently took a wonderful trip to Africa and went on several game drives. We saw so many new animals that I didn't know existed. Two of my friends, also on the trip, had your book. This book explained about the animals and had such great pictures that were such a help in distinguishing the animals. I liked the small area map that tells where the animal is found. The organization of the book is so helpful and easy to find what you are looking for. I have read it over and over again and used it as a reference for my presentations."
4,The Grape Grower,"I was looking for a basic book about growing grapes commercially, from roots to shoots. Although I am in Australia and the Book is written in America, the basic viticulture is identical, grape varieties of course are totally different. This book covers every aspect of viticulture in easy to read /comprehensive details. It provides the facts of viticulture and some tried & tested ideas. Fantastic framework and I recommend it to new and experienced viticulturists. Excellent reference."
5,An Eye Opener,"This book has taught me everything I need to know - after several aborted attempts at growing grapes over the years, I now have great vines that bear wonderfully. Thank you!"
4,Great book for the novice,"This is a really great book filled with more information than you would ever need about growing grape vines, particularly for the novice grower. Easy reading and just an all around great book.I purchased this book based upon the idea of wanting to plant a vine or two because my grandmother had a couple of grape vines I remembered as a child.Be careful, after reading this book I now have 10 vines in the ground with visions of many more and looking for a way to quit my job and make a living at it."
5,A Delightful Treat!,I could not put this book down until the end. The characters were powerfull and I can't wait until their next book
3,"A good read, yeah.","But not a great book. While the writing is far, far, far better than many books of this genre, the characters and, ultimately story, just aren't believable. They're close, but the hesitation in both of them just isn't realistic at all. And things wind up just a bit too pat. Every loose endm and I mean every one, is tied up. As I said, a good read, but that's about it."
5,Tryin To Sleep In The Bed You Made,I was truly touched by this book. The characters were two dimensional and the plot took many interesting twists and turns. I have always been an avid reader of African-American fiction books but I have never read one where the friendship of two women were so deeply explored. I didn't feel that they glossed over things. The plot also caused you to think of things in your own life. I could see myself and my friends in this book. I have given many copies to my friends. My book discussion group had a lively discussion which branced off into many other topics. I would have to say with all honesty that this is to date my favorite fiction book. I am excited that the authors have written a new book. I can't wait to read it.
5,You can not put it down,"THIS WAS AN EXCELLENT BOOK. I REALLY ENJOYED READING IT AND I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED WHEN I CAME TO THE END. I HOPE VIRGINIA AND DONNA CONTINUE TO WRITE BECAUSE THEY ARE VERY TALENTED. WHEN I FINISHED THIS BOOK I ACTUALLY FELT LIKE I NEW THE CHARACTERS PERSONALLY. I WOULD AND ALREADY HAVE RECOMMENDED THIS BOOK TO EVERYONE THAT I KNOW I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHORS, AND SAY KEEP ON DOING WHAT YOU DO BECAUSE YOU BOTH DO IT WELL"
3,Too Much Drama,"I write fiction about black love and families, etc., so I was very excited to see purchase and read this book. I think that although the book was well written, it had too many dramatic situations. Admittedly, I couldn't put the book down, because I was dying to see what would happen to the main characters, but at the same time, I felt overwhelmed by the series of tragedies taking place in the main characters' lives. I think it was a good first try for the authors, but I would like to see less twists and turns in future works."
2,Not for readers who like Jackie Collins or V.C. Andrews,"I thought the book was cute, but it did not hold my interest very long. I found some parts that made me want to keep going. But wants they had my interested and answered the questions, I lost interest again."
5,I Passed it on to my best friend!,An honest story about the trials of friendship. I still want to know what happens next! Gayle and Patricia can come over to my house for homemade donuts anytime
4,Tryin' to Sleep in the Bed You Made,"We had a book swap club at my last job, and this was the book that I was given in trade. I left the job before even starting it, and the book sat in my house for almost two years while I was ""getting around to taking it back"". So I picked it up to finally read it, and I was sorry I did not read it earlier. This is a very good book! I really enjoyed it. The only reason I gave it only four stars though was because I felt that the emphasis on race was too constant. The story would have been just as effective without the readers constantly having to be reminded that the characters are black. I would reccommend this book, especially to women, as they will best understand the delicate nature of female friendship. It is loyal and intense, but when a girlfriend lets you down it is the worst feeling ever! Hope you all enjoy this story as much as I did!"
4,Seamless,This is the first time I've read a novel written by two authors where I was surprised how seamless the writing was. It's fitting that two friends wrote such an engaging story of friendship.
5,True Friends To The End,"I sympathized with both Pat and Gayle because they went through alot with and without one another. The were both opposites but that did not stop them from showing genuine friendship to one another. I will suggest this book to anyone who is going through a rough time and feel like its the end, because both ladies go through alot but the learn how to make it, and they also learned that the rough times feel so much better when you have a true friend on your side."
4,Sometimes you get up with bed bugs,"Very moving story about the strength and weaknesses of women (not just black women). It's a story of principle, dreams and nightmares and how you find yourself at the very moment you learn to control both. These women teeter on the edge of self discovery ....all they need is a little push! And it takes inner strength and tough choices to realize sometimes you have to catch yourself."
4,who knew two (authors) could be this good together....,Great book. I will be a fan of Deberry and Grant's for a long long time if they keep writing them like this.
4,Excellent and Unpredictable,This is one of the best books that I have read in a long time! The characters were so well developed that you were able to feel the heartache and pain that each suffered. I highly recommend this book. I read it in two days because I could not put the book down!!
5,I Loved This Book!,"I bought this book a few years ago never hearing one word about whether or not the book was ""good"". They had copies on display in the bookstore and it sounded interesting so I took a chance. Well, this is, was, and always will be one of my all-time favorites. I really got into both characters and I was very happy to see Gayle and Pat, two former best friends get through their differences and problems with each other and realize that true friendship never dies. An excellent book that should not be missed!"
5,Couldn't put it down,"This is a great story of friendship, success, failure and hardship over several decades. It is well written and engaging. Other reviewers have outlined the plot, so I won't repeat it here. The Kindle version has quite a lot of typos, mainly letters left out of words. It was pretty easy to get the gist of what the word was supposed to have been, but annoying nonetheless."
4,Slow start but racing to a great finish!!!!!!!!,"This book starts out slow, but after a while it gets a hold of you, and has you eager for more. The things in this book happen each and every day out there to people. Pick this one up. I'm sure you won't be disappointed. I read it in two days. These ladies deserve a round of applause. I'm just waiting for the encore!!!!"
5,"One of the best, most realistic pieces of fiction ever!","This was a well-written,enjoyable,page-turner. Seldom has a book so consumed me that I would neglect everything else I needed to do to read it. The title was right on! Every character got what he/she deserved, i.e., they were made to sleep in the beds they made. My greatest satisfaction came with Ramsey's fate. And, even Gayle needed a wake-up call-- which she got, although I was glad it was short-lived. I can't wait for these authors' next literary hit."
5,GOOD FRIEND ARE HARD TO FIND,"ONCORE! THIS BOOK WAS EXCELLENT.I NEED MORE.I FELT LIKE I KNEW GAYLE,PAT AND MARCUS PERSONALLY.MARCUS I COULD USE IN MY LIFE.GOOD JOB LADIES.A CONTINUATION WOULD BE NICE."
5,A great book.,I bought this book when it first came out still read it every other year. It signifies what true friendship is. I like the way that Gayle's family took Pat in and made her a part of their family.
5,Trust Me This is a Great Book,"I suggested my aunt read the book on a bus trip that she was taking. She was a little hesistant at first, taking a book from her younger niece was questionable. I did not hear from my aunt until after she returned from her trip and she told me how she could not put the book down. She told me people had to make her get off the bus because she was so involved in the book. The funny part was the fact that my aunt was trying to make the story real. She is convinced that this is a story about the authors. She found the homes they were talking about in Martha's Vineyard, and other scenes from the book as well."
5,life story,i loved this book it is very inspiring its nice and realistic. pat and gayles friendship along with marcus was genuine the lessons they learned from decisions they made were beautiful and heart warming. i hope that the authors will put out a sequel to this book it very enlighting. i wish that i can give this book 10 stars rather than 5.
5,"I Really, Really Enjoyed the Book from Cover to Cover!!!!!","I enjoyed reading Tryin to Sleep. I found it to be Excellent writing (An Outstanding Story). I enjoyed it so much I bought three copies, for my friends and mother. TTS was recommended to me by my good friend Rod. We both agree that it was an outstanding novel. I appreciated all three characters. I believe that the friendship Pat, Gayle and Marcus had was one in which if everyone had or experienced, this world would be a better place. In closing I would like to say, This is one of the best books I've read thus far. It was so had to put the book down. I'm sure you ladies are writing your next book as we speak. Do you think there could be a sequel? I look forward to and can't wait to read it. Tryin to Sleep is a novel that felt very real. If the second book is anything like TTS, I know it will also be a best seller. Congratulations on an Excellent book."
4,Good but not the best,"I use this hammer drill to place expansion bolts in stone for rock climbers. My experience in hard sandstone is that the tool will drill around 10 holes with a new bit, 3/8"" by 4"" deep before needing a recharge. It's light and fast and seems to be fairly durable, a big improvement over the old Bulldog. But when it comes to real power in a cordless hammer drill think Hilti as in model TE5. I used one of those a while back and although a bit heavier this thing drilled 15 holes and was still going strong when I had to quit."
4,Nice Baster!,"Quality product, arrived promptly. It was exactly how it was portrayed to be. Heavy rubber pump, and nice stainless body."
1,Leaky baster,This baster leaks and I would not buy it again. I wasted my money and now am still looking for a good baster.
3,looks fine,"I haven't been able to use this yet, but it looks like it'll do the job when the time comes."
2,It came open and incomplete,"The product is ok, but it came open, and incomplete, the needle wasn't there. The original package is poor, so is ease to break off"
2,Is it me?,"I'd hate to think that I'm too dense to know how to use a turkey baster...but perhaps I am. I simply cannot get this thing to not immediately drop all its contents within seconds of suction. I suck up the hot liquid, and it all dumps out again within 2 seconds. I hear it all go in, and then when I lift it or just move it just a little it all goes rushing out. It's nice, though, construction wise."
2,The bulb is too weak!,"I was really disappointed the first time I used it. It didn't work well, the bulb is too soft and not tight around the stainless steel tube, so it didn't suck the hot broth up very well. Maybe it has been in the warehouse too long."
5,versatile in it's applications,I have two of these. One for cooking and one for use in the wood shop. In using it to baste it has proved to work very well in several ways; i.e. basting as well as removingthe grease that formed at the top of the juices from the baking process. I also use this baster in the shop when I mix small amounts of product in the refinishing process. The small screw on attachment refines or improves the performance of the product in many cooking and shop processes. Over all a nice addition in the kitchen and shop.
5,My Son is a Marine,"My son graduated from boot camp 8-3-12. I read this book after his graduation. I truly wish that I would have read it before he went, or at least while he was in boot camp. It summed my feelings up perfectly. It was a huge help to know that I was not the only Mom feeling the way I did! I would recommend this book to any parent who has a child entering the Marines. It was a blessing to me!"
3,A good start to an excellent band,"Like all bands, spiderbait had to start somewhere and this is it. Catchy Riffs and hardcore rock. It has some great songs like 'footy', 'run' and 'old man sam' but it is definetly my least fav. spiderbait album"
2,repetitive,"Obtained this book as my grandson was diagnosed with epilepsy. The book give some good information, but overall, seemed too basic. The book repeatedly mentioned that most forms of childhood epilepsy will frequently resolve with time - I think this is somewhat unrealistic and tends to minimize the problems associated with this condition.The only 2 things I learned from the entire book was not to overindulge or overprotect the child and that the seizure threshold increases with age.I was looking for strategies to help my grandson cope with epilepsy - but this book did not really provide that. It may be best suited for those children who have benign idiopathic seizures, such as febrile, but not for those who have other abnormalities that will not resolve with time."
1,Really disliked,"I couldn't wait for this book to be over. I am a strange reader, if I start a book, I really must finish the book.This was and effort. Very disappointing."
2,A train wreck,This book started out good but got horrible after that. It reminded me of a second rate soap opera. I only gave it two stars because it was good enough to finish reading. It creates intrigue but once you find out what happens it like are you serious. The second book is even worse.
5,Great Book!,"Fern Michaels outdid herself in this book. I could not put it down. I am now reading the sequel, Sins of the Flesh and so far, it's just as good as the first book. Would recommend both books!!"
5,A hit for Fern Michaels,"I am a long time fan of Fern Michaels and don't know how I missed this one as it is not new.I found myself talking back to the characters and found it hard to put the book down. Now, I am going to read the sequel."
4,fern michaels,a great story told in two volumes.. best if read in the correct order. but she tells a wonderful story and weaves the characters in fine fashion.
5,Great for Poetry Lovers Everywhere:),"I love this calendar! Everyday I get to read a wonderful short poem or quote about poetry. Plus if I wanted to, I could carry the poems in my pocket. :) I hope they come out with one every year. A wonderful idea!"
5,never gets old in review,"I purchased this product years ago in cassette tape format.I am replacing it with the CDs, because I no longer have a cassette player in my vehicle.I am doing the same with several other sales training materials that I have.This one is among the top 5 that I always listen to."
5,Inspirational and informative,"This book is a great addition to the serious metalsmith's library. The work of several Penland-associated artists is showcased in full-color photographs and their techniques are explained in easy-to-understand text. If you want to expand your notion of what jewelry is, get some ideas for future projects, or learn some new techniques, this is a wonderful book to buy."
5,Penland Book of Jewelry,Enjoyed the artists comments as to their reasoning while they create and why they came to create as they do. Excellent photos demonstrate techniques. Thank you for a good reference book.
4,some different expresions of the metalsmithing...,good inspiration for starting to expres our own ideas in metalsmithing
5,Title says it all,"This is Elton's pinnacle album. It was also the original band's swan song. Capt. Fantastic was recorded and intended for a 1974 release but the record company pushed it back to release Greatest Hits. That is why they never played it live. That is why the new band played it live. The new band was sufficient ( I saw them in '76 ),but the true magic was gone. We all fall/curtains is the greatest song I ever heard in my 40 plus years. I only wish they would release Hollywood Bowl '73 & Dodger Stadium 10/75. Most everyone who read this probably know all this. Here's to us. It is a pity the new generations will probably miss out on all this."
5,Skip the Prequals and Read This,"This is a fantastic work. It is not a story, although many are contained in it, but an encylopedia documenting the Dune Universe up to the God Emperor. I got my copy years ago and treasure it. This was obviously done by people who loved the Dune series and were not just out to make a buck, as in the latest prequal Buttlerian Jihad. Pick a subject or item from Dune and it is probably outlined here. Any fan of Dune will find this book an indespensible part of their library."
5,Documents the depth of a universe you -knew- existed,"The Dune Encyclopedia is a monumental piece of work. The depth and detail of research are very impressive. The seriousness of the content, and the simplicity of presentation make this far more palatable than the many pedestrian 'encyclopedias' of the more common space operas (Star Trek, Star Wars, etc.). This is an important piece of literature for any serious SF fan, and a must-have for any follower of the Dune universe."
4,Dune Encyclopedia,"Got this as a present for my Son, who was quite happy with it.I had expected something a little different (hard cover rather than paperback) and the protective wrap could have been a little sturdier, but the seller's customer service department promptly suggested a fix.They offered a partial credit which I accepted, but it has not yet posted to my account."
4,Far Superior to the Prequels,"The authors of the three Dune prequels (House Atreides, House Harkonnen, and House Corrino) have repudiated The Dune Encyclopedia and it is very unlikely to be reprinted because parts are inconsistent with the prequels. Having read both, I believe that The Dune Encyclopedia is closer to Frank Herbert's vision than the prequels. For example, in the prequels the planet Ix, source of technology for the Empire, is ruled by one of the Great Houses. In Frank Herbert's books no mention is made of Ix being affiliated with the nobility, and The Dune Encyclopedia follows Frank Herbert in making it an exception to the general system. This book also fills an important place because Frank Herbert enjoyed introducing concepts such as the Orange Bible or the Bulterian Jihad without much explanation. The conclusions reached here seem plausible given the structure of the Dune books written by Frank Herbert. If you can find this book at a used book sale, buy it."
4,Encyclopedia Fantastica,"I found this book at my local library three years ago, just after I first started reading the Dune series, and it has proven to be an invaluable tool for filling in background information, details on certain subjects, and overall reference use. The intricacy of the compendium is phenomenal, and (I believe) everything fits together seamlessly! My only regret is that it doesn't contain more information; if it did, it would have to be an entire series of encyclopedias, though. It is almost never checked out by anyone, and, since I also work at the library, I am going to be the first person after this book should we decide to purge it from our collections!"
4,Super Reader,"An overview of the places, people and technology in the Dune universe. This explains a lot of the detail of things that Herbert just mentions in passing, such as the scientists that invented shields, or space travel, or things like that.It is very useful to gain a better understanding of all those finer points."
5,"Lovingly, Everything Dune","It took me many a reread of Dune and it's sequels before I came to the conclusion that I had to have this book. On a daily basis, I thumb through it and learn and relearn what's most fascinating to me as well as very pertinent, and fascinating asides.Simply put, this book is worth it's weight in Spice (trite, I know) for anyone who adores this series. Even if the price escalates into the four digits someday for this work, one would not regret their purchase."
4,Shipping could have been better,"Made this purchase because of unit price when buying 5 filters at a time. Filters work well. Only problem was that 1 corner of shipping box was dented in transit. This dented several filters inside. To place these filters into our AC/furnace, have to remove 2 cover pieces instead of just one. Other than that, product works as advertised."
1,Great Watch if it works,"I bought this watch in 2010 and it worked for a good solid 8 months. After 8 months, the second hand would go to 12:00 and then fall down to 6. Then the battery died and after replacing the battery, the watch will not function. It worked great and was a fanatastic field watch...when it worked. Sadly, I will not pay to have it repaired as the repairs will cost more than the watch. Buy with caution."
1,"please read, do not skip over this review","I have ordered a lot of items online, but this is by far the worst product I have ever purchased in my life. I really do wish that someone from amazon would read this and possibly do something to fix it. I know some of you are saying, why not return it? I wont return it because I purchased it and its my fault I own it. Now back to the product, the watch does not fit comfortably at all, the bands stick out the sides when you put it on your wrist and it is just overall completely uncomfortable. The straps are made of very thin fraying canvas, please listen to me and do not purchase this watch."
4,Good watch for running around,"I agree with the 3 star complaint about the watchband, but over all it functions very well for a light weight, run around, no worry, summer watch. Goes okay with shorts sandals and beachware. It's not plastic so it doesn't rub or cut in the heat, and that makes it a nice accessory in a Tommy Bahama kind of way. A very cheap price and the ability to swap colors makes it a 4 for me. I purchased the green face and based how I'v liked it, I'm going to order the black face."
2,Broke within 2 days,You get what you pay for it looks nice but its cheap i may consider spending 10 more $ to get a new one
2,Cheap watch.,I purchased a cheap priced watch for work....It meet the need and the price. It was made in China. You get what you pay for.
1,Don't waster your money,This was the worst purchase I have ever made on Amazon. The watch was OK but the straps were terrible. Two of them broke when I was putting them on so it left me with just one.The one I was left with was very uncomfortable. I purchased this item because I liked the idea of being able to have the different bands to wear on different days. The quality of the bands was so poor I never had the chance. I should have listened to the other negative reviews I read before I purchased this terrible product. It would have saved me some momey.
2,Not worth it,I bought this watch and went swimming. The next day it had water in it and the time was off by 10minutes.
1,still waiting for an answer...,"I didn't receive this watch, but a very similar one of the same price range. When I contacted the vendor, they answered that they were going to submit a replacement order with the correct item, but it never arrived nor did they answer my next e-mails."
4,"Good wind up watch, hands glow!","Just got the watch, so this is initial impressions. Watch looks nice, bands seem excessive, but maybe one night I'll use the black band when I go out for a nice dinner. Bands are easy to swap out. Action works fine, but I can't figure out how to set the date (yet). Most importantly (to me) the hands of the watch glow, which weirdly isn't mentioned in the item description, and is very nice feature."
4,Beatiful,"very elegant and beautiful and very satisfied with the delivery date was estimated, matching bracelets with interchangeable clock hope to buy another watch in another color I am satisfied with the purchase."
5,AIR FILTERS A GOOD BUY!,Not much to say except for the money this is the best buy in town. I have complaints with this product and will buy more when this shipment runs out.
1,"1 pack, not 12","I ordered this iem thinking it is 12 3 oz units, but they sent me just 1 3 oz puch.yes, JUAT 1. then, i called , and they made a replacement order for me. i thought it should be right this time, but to my surprise, again ONE SINGLE 3 OZ POUCH. customer service was great, they refunded my money, but why did they do this? shipping weight also seems to be right with 3 pounds on the product page, ubt that is not what you get. i am deeply disapppointed."
2,Zetafab,"I've owned this tool for almost one year and use it five days per week in my welding/metal fabrication business. The performance of the tool excellent, it really removes metal with a 9"" hardwheel. The problem is the trigger. I'm predisposed to like german tools, especially the ergonomics. The ergonomic design of the trigger/handle on this tool is poor. At first I thought I'd get used to the way you have to pull back and squeeze the trigger but I haven't. My hand is not small (medium sized glove is tight) but the handle/trigger together are too big and my hand is never comfortable. Bosch got it wrong on this tool."
1,the size is not right at all - it should be 3-6 years old,"When I purchase the Intex Junior set the manufacturer recommended Age: 36 months - 18 years not right at all. My son is only 7 year it was to tight and he doesn't have a big head at all, so I was not happy at all with the purchase."
3,Confusing sizing,"I purchased this item for my 6 year old son for our vacation. Fortunately we tried it all before we left and found that the fins were WAAAAAY too big. The box says 3-6 years old so I thought even though he's a LITTLE small for his age, not a lot, that we would be fine. NOT SO! He wears a kids size 13 shoe and the fins are marked size 3 (NOT 3 YEARS like the box). It did work out for us as he had swim shoes (wet socks) that we were able to insert in the fins and them he slipped his foot in.We did enjoy the product, but be aware of the correct size when purchasing."
5,a keeper,"Cole Guerra's first album alternates deftly between catchy riffs and moody currents, but always keeps the listener thinking. I'm not sure if the emotion drives the music or vice versa, but it is clear that this collection was a passion in the making, and the result is a raw gem. I'll stop mixing metaphors like a wine expert writing for Rolling Stone, and just recommend this album to anyone who appreciates a sophisticated yet accessible (oops, sorry) work of art."
4,"The Best 8-1/4"" Circ. Saw I Could Find","I tried three different 8-1/4"" circular saws. Both the Dewalt and Hitachi had, in my opinion, serious functional and ergonomic flaws. My hands actually hurt after using the Hitachi for only a couple of cuts. The Dewalt was designed so that you can't see the blade as you're cutting, and the base was far out of alignment with the blade.The Bosch is far more comfortable to use. I can see the leading edge of the blade, and the guide marks at the front of the base are quite accurate, so ""cutting to the line"" is pretty easy. It has plenty of power, as it now comes with a 15-amp motor. The base isn't perfectly aligned with the blade, but it's much closer than either of the other two saws. I haven't had any trouble with the base flexing, even though it's not as stiff as the Hitachi's.All in all, it's clearly the best of the three saws. I never tried the Makita.If you're in the market for an 8-1/4"" saw, I recommend that you start with either the Bosch or Makita."
2,Junk,"Bought this saw for the added depth in order to lap 4x6 timbers. The saw refused to track straight, so I spent the whole time fighting to keep it on line. Using a straight edge as a fence was worse 'cuz it drove the footplate into it, burning out the anti-kickback clutch. Only good thing was the strong motor. Do yourself a favor, look for something else..."
2,An oversimplified summary about Soros,"For those who admire George Soros and would like to be able to quote the sacred name in front of his/her average investor friends, fine. But for those who want to earn money by studying how one of the greatest traders of our century excels in the market, please read Alchemy of Finance and Soros on Soros."
4,"messiah, a truely great game",messiah is in a genere of its own. It mixes awsome graphics with nice sounds and great AI. The power to posses people lets you be mulitple characters through out the game. I had lots of fun playing this game(the boss is extremely hard)
4,Incedible game and a unique Idea,"I played this along time ago and was immersed until the end. It was on my old PC and the graphics were top notch but I could not play at full copacity...I am now going to play it on my new gaming pc and it shall rock..This game is beutiful, challenging, full of action and smarts. The idea behind the game play is awesome. The worlds and characters are realistic and belivable...so, put on that Halo and get ready to be plunged into a new futuristic world!!!"
2,Messiah,"Messiah is a third person game. Set in the future you play an angel called Bob sent from god to save the world from the bad humans. The angel is very small and weak, It can be easily killed, but it can posses any charecter it wants and take control of the charecter, Only after becoming someone it can carry weapons. The graphics and sound are average, charecter animation are not very impressive. Messiah's problems is that it is quite difficult, To posses someone you need to fly behind him and jump into his back and that is very hard to do so because of the third person camera angle. The game is quite short too."
4,Exiting But Challenging,"The game is very exiting but also very difficult to figure out initially. The graphics are amazing and the 3D freeplay creates a real feeling of being in the game.No rules, no limits, and no fear makes this game a must own."
5,A feast for the eyes,"Even if I didn't know some of the contributors to this book, I would still regard it as wonderful. I had the privilege of seeing these quilts when they were on display, and the photography does them remarkable justice. Even if you aren't a quilter, seeing these magnificent creations is a treat for anyone who appreciates beauty."
3,BIRDS LOVE THIS A LITTLE TOO MUCH,Having just purchased the Brome squirrel proof feeder I wanted to use a quality seed to attract a wide variety of birds. Attract them is an understatement. It's more like a feeding frenzy where 10 birds will fight to get to the 4 openings in the feeder. A 7 pound bag will last maybe 5 days. Upon closer examination there is a lot of waste. The birds seem mostly interested in the sunflower seeds. They constantly peck at the feeder hole spilling the small seed all over the ground. The squirrels are loving it. They sit for hours under the feeder waiting for the less desirable seed to rain down. They have made no attempt to get to the feeder because the pickings are so good on the ground. Stokes Select is definitely a quality seed that will attract birds as advertised. Having said that I will probably not purchase it again due to the high cost and fast consumption. Sunflower seed is much cheaper and this seems to be what the birds really savor.
1,The birds will not eat it.,"Stokes Select STK5137-07 Cardinal Songbird Select birdseed is the worst seed I have ever bought. The birds won'tcome near it and it certainly didn't attract any songbirds. Even my cardinals would not touch it. I don't know if it was moldy or what the problem was, but my husband has thrown it in the garbage. What a waste of money!!!!"
3,Not working yet,Doesn't seem to be attracting anything yet. I will udpate my review if that changes when colder weather arrives.update: the birds have found the food and it got eaten pretty quickly by some sparrows. Nothing more colorful than that yet. Will save the rest of the seed until it gets colder and then see if we attract something more interesting.
1,Leaks!,"I had high hopes for this to go with my 5.11 Rush 72 bag. Disapointed.The canteen leaks water around where you screw the cap on. Does not matter how tight you screw it on. If you tip it to it's side & shake it a few times, water will start dripping out. the Nalgene canteens I bought, on the other hand, work fantastic.Don't waste your money on this."
1,Our Dog Loved It,"I bought this for our Christmas dinner. BIG mistake. What we received was a very small, and extremely overpriced turkey stuffed with little pieces of what may have been duck and/or chicken... and a lot of nasty-tasting stuffing. The proportions were NOTHING like what is pictured.Unfortunately, due to the nature of the product (frozen, stuffed) and the time it is traditionally served (Thanksgiving and Christmas dinner) you don't find out it is crap until it comes out of the oven... and by then you are stuck with it, because most of the stores are already closed.Despite the small amount of meat, it easily fed seven people, with ample left-overs... mainly because nobody finished what was on their plates, let alone went back for seconds.On a positive note, our dog loved the stuff and happily ate everything that was dumped into her bowl."
2,Interesting but disappointing,"Several friends who'd had turduckens raved about them. So I tried it for Christmas day. First, it looked good. The turkey tasted excellent. It was hard to find the duck - there seemed to be only bits of duck. And I still haven't found the chicken. Next year it's back to a straight turkey."
1,Best Turducken is from Hebert's!,"If you want the ORIGINAL, order straight from the source - Hebert's. All of their products are delicious, and less expensive! Try the deboned, stuffed chicken!"
5,Awesome piece of work!,"I highly recommend this book to everyone! I came upon this powerful tool at a time when I needed to break the pattern that I had created for myself which was sending me into a downward spiral of emotions. I've seen numerous changes in areas of my life merely by confronting and experiencing fears instead of running away. It saved time and I was able to get on with more important goals. I've learned that if a person is honest with him or herself and truly applies the techniques mentioned in this book, they will see results. Just make it happen!Chris"
1,junk robot,"Do not buy this toy. We received as a gift. The box looks beautiful and the ""make your own assembly"" idea is a good one but the product is extremely hard to put together for a young child, breaks easily (1st try), and has too few pieces. It is not possible to put together all the pieces into one single robot and, if it is, it would take most adults too long to figure it out. The toy manufacturer should scrap this toy."
5,Melissa White's performance dazzles,"I was thrilled (though not surprised) to hear that even in this very early recording of An American Concerto, Melissa White's incredible technical virtuosity as well as her passionate musicality is quite present. This recording forshadows the incredible talent she has cultivated thus far and one can only imagine how much more successful she will become. I look forward to hearing more of her stunning performances."
1,Better Than A Sleeping Pill,"Set in an upscale suburb, the novel starts right off on the first page with a murder. It then takes a good 200 pages for anything of real interest to occur once more. The ending is rather good & one would not suspect whose responsible for the nasty goings on. Trouble is are we reading a murder mystery or a Mommy & Me story? There is so much superfluous fluff written into each chapter dealing with the kids it kills the book. It seems it's written in there to take up space. You'll find yourself scanning, instead of reading, to get past the Mommies & little ones. I came close to just chucking this one. So much unnecessary verb-age I'll have to rate this a 1 star despite the rather good ending. This was my 1st & last novel by this author"
1,"yeah, right","To go along with the premise of this book, you would have to believe that a mother of small children would willingly commit suicide leaving her children in the hands of a psychopath who has just threatened her child's life. (This isn't a spoiler, this is the opening chapter). I'm sorry, but I can't believe anyone is dumb enough to commit suicide and leave her child(ren) motherless on the guarantee of a psychopath that her child will be spared. Really easy to figure out who the psychopath is, too, even though you never really learn why. Miss this one."
4,Good mystery,"This book was frightening and very clearly written. People who thought crime would never touch them are mistaken. Murder is afoot in this very good mystery, and the fear and suspense keep growing. Yes, really.I won't say more, but I was wrong every time I thought I had it figured out."
5,It kept me up all night,"This is one of the best books that I have read in a long time, It had suspense, along with everyday life living in the suburbs. I will recommend this book to everyone."
5,DVD extra value.,I originally purchased the music only CD as I was not aware that the enhanced version was available. Soooooo glad I got this version. After Forever were amazing yet their rubbish record company (Transmission) did'nt promote them well at all. After Nuclear Blast took them on it was hoped for better things but the band decided to fold. Now their catalogue is almost unavailable anywhere. They didn't really get a DVD concert together which is more the pity! What an amazing and quite original band that too many people will not get to see or hear.
3,The group has seen better days.,"To be honest I am not at all impressed with this album. As a whole it is not very good. Cry with a smile was good and so was Empty Memories, but after that there was nothing that really struck me as wonderful. I sort of enjoyed Energize Me and Equally Destructive, but when matched up to their albums Invisible Circles and Decipher it just doesn't make the cut. Not to say it's a ""bad album"". It is just not up to the standards of After Forever. I would go after the two albums aforementioned before getting this one."
4,Pretty good story,"The overall was fine, for someone who knows history and biblical reference, this could annoy them :)It did seem like the characters were a bit reaching and boring, the Sigma Force team are all just too nice, to perfect... the bad guys well they remind of the worst part of every villain... and there were alot of coincidences, which I don't buy. The girl happens to be in France, precisely when Sigma is in France...But if you want a decent story with fast paced adventure, this is a great story... It kept me wondering what will happen next, and I finished it rather quickly.I have been a fun for years, after I first read Amazonia and keep coming back... the Sigma Force books are starting to run on the same storyline though.Overall I liked it for a decent adventure story so it go 4 stars. I don't give spoilers so can't really reference points in the book and the plot summary tells you the overall storyline..."
3,Fun read,"This is a fun read. I don't think the science is 100% correct. If that's what you're looking for, go elsewhere. If you want a fun, page turner that you need to finish then try Map of Bones."
2,Lost two stars,"Ok, Rollins botches the Mithra-Christianity connection, but then most people who are even aware of it would agree with Rollins, unless they were historians who are Mithra specialists. That could be lived with, the character thinking that was probably one of the many who aren't a specialist.Then we have a super knowledgeable Catholic priest directly tied to the Vatican (in Vatican intelligence) who gets into all kinds of gnostic crap and the old saws about the ""Lost Gospels"" as if there was anything to that junk!Of course, it does have good action and even if it was a bit over the top on some of the fantastic coincidences and plot twists, it was a lot of fun like Die Hard.Until the last scene, when the hero pours a possible cure for his father's Alzheimer's that is when this book dropped from a 4 to 2 star review."
4,Good but not as good as his others,"It has been a while since I read this. It took a bit longer for it to really grab me like his others did. There is a lot of detail research information from the Bible and other papers and explanations of what they mean to the story. Others have read the book and liked it better than I did. I did like the book, but liked the others better."
4,A really Well Thought Out Plot,"The is the only book I have read by this author, but if this book is any indication of his storytelling prowess I will be on the lookout for his other volumes the next time I am ordering from Amazon or in the bookshop.With books of intrigue and conspiracy it is all too easy to inadvertently start giving away parts of the plot, so a brief synopsis is the best way to avert spoiling the reader's enjoyment.An elite force are on the hunt for a clandestine fraternity of alchemists, who date back many hundreds of years to the Middle Ages. The fraternities aim is to establish a new world order using mystical bones of the Magi.The elite force follow clues leading from some of Europe's most famous cathedrals. Through the remnants of famous monuments to a place where science and religions unite and the threat could be the most calamitous since the beginning of time . . .Fast paced, thrilling, exciting, this book has everything. I didn't want it to end."
4,"Good book, LONG science mumbo jumbo","I like the whole ""da vinci code"" theme, so when I heard about this book, I was interested.The story and the writing was great! The only thing I didn't like about it was when the characters would start talking about the science of protrons and neutrons. It was alittle to science class for me.Besides that I loved it!"
2,religious claptrap,This barebones story is filled with lore and superstition that underscores the human derived stupidity that the ignorant state of mind called religion has been and continues to be based.
3,Map is no Sandstorm!,"Even though I actually liked Sandstorm better, SIGMA force's first adventure - Map of Bones was also a good and solid read.A little too much for me in places, but still chock full of high adventure and character driven prose. Rollins is just plain awesome in this genre. Best in the business.C'mon, Hollywood, what are ya waitin' for...!?"
4,Better than his other books,"I'll confess to having read all of the other books Mr. Rollins has written. They're all in the same genre of exploring some mystery that borders on the fanstastic and takes the reader through all manner of fast paced joy.This book is in the same vein as all of the others. The only difference is that in this book, the author actually managed to flesh out the characters more than some of the past books. I found myself actually caring about whether or not some of them made it through the adventure.That being said, the story is somewhat formula. The characters are constantly being ambushed inexplicably by the enemy who they don't know. They're a traitor or two in their midst and they have to figure out the mystery in the middle of it.Fast paced, hard to put down, a fun read."
1,Unreadable,"This is a canned product with only a potential for having been a decent reading. The characters are predictable and uninteresting, the technical explanations boring, the storytelling contrived. I couldn't finish this book and will never again attempt to read anything by this author."
2,couldn't finish,"Well, I'm 90 pages into this book and I'm afraid I'm going to have to put it away. It's that boring.It's very rare that I won't make myself finish a book, but this book is sheer drudgery for me. I LOVED DaVinci Code, Angels and Demons, and The Last Templar. This book was nothing like those--at least not in the first 90 pages and I just can't force myself to go on reading any further. It's just been a very tedious book involving murders and car chases. I want suspense, mystery, and puzzle solving!"
2,The Da Vinci Clone,"Although the Da Vinci Code is no masterpiece, compared to this book it is. I have found this story far fetched to say the least. The authors voice never disappeared behind the story. The entire book read like.., well as if someone was making it up. I mean come on, how many days can a character go without sleep? Rollins' attempt to infuse his story with romance was executed incredibly heavy-handedly. Skip this one."
3,Map of Bones,"This book is sort of a slow starter with the same action sequences happening over and over. It picks up about 250 pages in; however, I would recommend reading Black Order by James Rollins instead. This book is much more interesting and a page turner!"
4,Not bad.,"I like Rollin's style of writing. He keeps you interested. This book is much better than Sandstorm though, which I wasn't crazy about. I like that he can put in a little Indiana Jones-esque magic now and then in his books because so many of these thrillers try so hard to make everything scientifically possible that it gets annoying reading about this or that supposedly real piece of army junk. I prefer Rollin's to Dan Brown, but I can't say why. This is a good book though. His best [...]"
2,Dan Brown meets Clive Cussler,"Take ""the da Vinci Code"", add any of the Dirk Pitt novels from Clive Cussler (including the perennial diving/underwater part),add lots of pseudo scientific speculation, two thirds of action, top up with a hot-blooded latin lady, mix thoroughly and... voila! there's a new James Rollins novel.In general it seems like the locations througout Europe were researched during a ""one week - see all"" trip.Stereotype characters, errors in in native language quotes (e.g. ""bellissimo bambini"") and so on.Still, it is a fast paced novel with lots of action which at least kept me from putting it aside. Unfortunately, I bought the hard cover edition which was a kinda waste of money."
3,Not bad,"Enjoyed it. There wasn't too much to shout to the world about, but I liked it. The idea was intriguing, but not much actually ever seemed to happen. I also prefer characters who at times are brilliant but perhaps blind and stupid in differing areas. You might enjoy it, I'd suggest others first though.The one I've been telling everyone about lately has been The Unsuspecting Mage by Brian S. Pratt. It's his first book and a little rough, but the action and story keep you enthralled the whole way through. Magic, secret passages, underground rivers, wow! He's going to be someone talked about someday."
4,While waiting for the next Dan Brown installment,"Pretty good. Having read the DaVinci books, it was nice having something else to read while waiting for Dan Brown to come up with the next book.You have to read something while waiting for your favorite authors to crank out the next book.This fits that bill nicely."
4,"Maybe Not Original, But Very Entertaining","Sure the subject matter (cover ups in the Catholic Church, mysterious meanings of ancient objects) isn't original, but Map of Bones is a very entertaining book. The action is non-stop, and the plot is intriguing. Sure, the book should not be taken as historical fiction, but rather clever fantasy, but the fact remains that Rollins is a very clever story teller and I suspect this book should appeal to a broad audience.Bottom line is this, if you are a fan of the Dan Brown books or like Clive Cussler/Robert Ludlum thrillers (or both), you'll like this book. This is the first book I've read by this author, but I'm already planning to read more."
5,$igma Force at Its Best,"Fast paced adventure . I enjoy the travel and history in this series. James Rollins does a lot of research of areas that the characters go to as well as covering the historical aspects, plus throw in espionage and mystery .How can you go wrong?"
3,Fast action that takes a long time to go anywhere,"Definitely not my favorite of the Sigma Force books. Good characterization as always but I found the plot repetitive, much of it following a pattern in which location changed but not the main elements. Find a piece of the puzzle, figure out where to go, get there only to discover the 'bad guys' get there first and shoot/knife or bomb the Sigma Force people ... who escape to repeat this pattern.I got tired of the long 'track down' details of the each step in the puzzle and got bored with the repeated shoot/knife/blow up everyone and everything around the located site. I read it but ended up skimming quite a bit of the 'repeats'."
3,Good fun....but a few touches could have made it really great,"Pros: Good adventure, a bit of mystery interleaved with historical details. Reasonable character development. The technical details appeared reasonable...I only googled liquid body armor and npl super black, but those turned up.Cons: Character development could have been better. I think the book crossed the point of too much adventure without enough introspection in between. I found the continual hostage crisis annoying. How many times do you have to be held hostage by the same guy before you get a clue? Hmmmm....we need some more drama...how about another hostage crisis. Some parts of the plot could have been supported better...just don't think too deeply about it.The bottom line: It's a good entertaining read and well worth it...just don't expect perfection."
3,Suspend disbelief...,"If you want a fun, historically interesting, fast read - this is it. I liked the book but was at times thinking it was a bit ridiculous. The end was a bit of a dud for me too. Overall, I liked the history and science in the book - all of which can be further researched. And, I liked the main characters. There is a clunky mini-romantic element which I am not sure why it was included. There are some over the top sequences and escapes too. But you read these books for what they are - escapist fun! Suspend disbelief for a while and enjoy. I am looking forward to reading the other Sigma Force books."
2,Amateurish,"Map of Bones appears intriguing, but fails miserably to deliver. The characters are wooden; the villan's sadism towards women is gratuitous; the reading level is on par with the fifth grade and about half way into the story I realized I didn't care about how it ended. Why did I finish reading this boring story? I hated wasting the time I had already invested in reading the first half. So do yourself favor. Don't read this book. It's silly and boring."
1,Very disappointing,"I consider myself fairly well read in this genre which probably says alot about my intellect. Be that as it may, this book should be subtitled ""The most inept special force ever"". Stay away. Read Preston/Child, Lee Child, Cussler, Hunter or Jack Higgins before you waste your time on this."
2,No Dan Brown,"I have read three of James Rollins books ""Ice Hunt"", ""Excavation"", and ""Map of Bones"". In ""Map of Bones"" as well as the others I really enjoyed the characters as well as the story line. In all three of his books, however, the ending is so off beat and far from reality that I finished the book feeling somewhat cheated in that I committed the time to spend reading the last third. If you select this because you think he is another Dan Brown, you will be disappointed."
3,it's average,"well, i enjoyed reading this book. i thought it was a good concept, however, there's a lot of things that, even for fiction, seem far fetched. i wont ruin it for people who are planning on buying this, but this story is not as believable as dan brown stories. i mean, that's saying alot since dan brown books aren't anything close to believable. the ending could have been better, and i was expecting better since there is so much detail given about events happening throughout the book."
3,Too long too many chase scenes,"The book begins with enticing chases and religious historical mysteries that keep the reader involved. But after 300 plus pages of chase scenes, the deceptions become transparent and the suspense repetitive. This book would have been better if it were about 100 pages shorter. Chase scenes become just as tiresome in print as they do on screen."
2,"Not Awful, Just not up to Expectations","As a big fan of James Rollins I am always happy to start one of his novels, and ""Map of Bones"" was no exception. I jumped right into the story, and immediately liked the main character of Gray. But as the story progressed I found myself losing interest. ""Map of Bones"" does have it's moments, but for some reason it fails where other Rollins books, like ""Excavation"", ""Amazonia"" and ""Ice Hunt"" succeed. I just couldn't get into the rhythm of the story. I would find myself losing interest, or getting it confused with ""Excavation"", a better story involving strange gold and religion. Normally when I crack open a Rollins novel I eagerly come back to it and usually finish it off within a couple days. That was not the case with ""Map of Bones"". I would pick it up, and leave it for awhile, then come back to the story, but without the anticipation a Rollins tale normally produces. James Rollins is a fantastic author, but I wouldn't recommend this as the book to start with."
4,Them Bones,After reading Ice Hunt I quickly jumped into the next book by Mr. Rollins. A romp across Europe with bad girls and boys chasing the heroes was well done. I enjoyed the historical information intermixed with the 'what if'.
2,Read it in print,"The publisher should be ashamed of this digital version, which seems to have been created by scanning the printed version and skipping the proofreading. As an example of the poor quality of the digital version, this is a Sigma Force novel, yet in an early chapter where the protagonists are given a report with the Greek letter sigma on the cover, the digital version has a question mark instead of a sigma! Ellipses in the printed version, to indicate that someone was interrupted in mid-sentence, are frequently rendered as a space in the digital version. The scanner that created this version was also confused by text in italics, often not including the space after the last italic word. In addition, with the printed version you get a couple of useful maps - Europe and the Vatican - that are so small in the digital version that they're useless. Finally, the story itself isn't as well crafted as Rollins' other novels, relying too much on extended action sequences for my taste."
3,Like a low budget action movie,"Not bad, lots of action, ok characters, but the writing style is so basic and the sentences so short that it's hard to build interest. I finished it, but because I wanted to see how it came out. That's totally different than a book that I don't want to end because I'm enjoying being in that world with the author. This book just goes from one catastrophe to the next and you already know who's going to win."
5,Map of Bones: a Sigma Force Novel,This book was very good. I didn't think I would like it at first but it became more interesting as I got into the book.I may even consider purchasing other books in this series.
2,Unrealistic,"Look... the plot sounds great, the writting and dialog is better than a Dan Brown book. BUT like Dan's book they're not realistic... How can the main characters survive the hundreds of grenades, bombs and bullets being tossed at them throughout the book, and I mean HUNDREDS. It's toooo James Bondish for me! The great plot was quickly diminished by all the silliness of combat. Only the bad guys got killed. I haven't finished the book and I sure it will end with the usual lead man and lead woman solving all the clues, rescuing the planet in the nick of time and falling in love by the last chapter. It gets 2 stars for the plot idea only, everything else gets a big ZERO."
2,Not his best work.,Just ridiculous. I've read and liked each of Rollins books but this time he has stepped well beyond the realm of even action thriller plausibility. Take it down a notch towards reality next time.
3,MAP OF BONES,I USUALLY LOVE JAMES ROLLINS BOOKS BUT THIS ONE IS JUST A LITTLE TO WORDY. HE GOES INTO SUCH TECHNICAL DETAIL FOR EVERY PHASE OF THE STORY THAT I FIND MYSELF SKIPPING A LOT AND JUST READING THE QUOTED SECTIONS. I GET BORED WITH TOO MUCH PROSE AND NOT ENOUGH MOVING FORWARD WITH THE STORY.
2,"Not Believable, doesen't get any better with time.","This book, as all other Rollins' books, suffer/s from the same error in story telling. Very simply, they are not believable. These so called professional characters and agencies are at best amateurish and at worst, totally incompetent. Even a good Sci Fi book must be believable or plausible. Rollins fails terribly on this believability issue. The plots are good but held together with smoke and mirrors.Reading Rollins' books are a frustrating endeavor. This and other Rollins' thrillers could be a great books but it just doesn't happen. I give up waiting for better. There are much better thrillers being written."
4,Wow...! Look out Dan Brown,"This was every bit as good as The DaVinci Code. I read it straight through in one sitting, and am seriously considering a re-read this weekend, I liked it so much. Excellent read!"
5,Great read!,"I was looking for a new author and happened upon this title. I didn't expect much, but it didn't take very many pages to know I was wrong. It was the kind of book you don't want to put down. Enough detail to draw you into the action, but not so much as to bore you. I will definitely pick up the other books."
2,"An okay read, and Mr. Rollins has written better books.",Mr. Rollins seems to have taken a long winding road to confusion and boredom in this book. This book is way too long and could be shortened by a hundred or so pages. I don't know what the author was trying to accomplish with this book as it was a kind of a knock of of The DaVinci Code but more confusing. The storyline seemed to wander at times and then get back on track but then you didn't know how it got back on track. How and why some of the scenarios came to be was a bit confusing too. But I will continue to read James Rollins' novels as they usually are action packed and keep you reading.
4,Very interesting but too long.,"I enjoyed reading this book very much. Great story, lots of action, and kept me asking questions.The only thing I didn't like was that I think his was about 150 pages too long...This really reminded me of the DaVinci code. If you enjoyed that then this will be right up your alley!"
3,Attention Rollins Fans!!,"As one of his avid fans, I am somewhat disappointed with Rollins ""morphing into Matthew Reilly"" reality. It is exactly what I felt as the other reviewer from Indiana pointed out.Actually, we can already feel the morph beginning from Sandstorm, of which the Sigma Force came into entity. In this novel the heroes were not civilians any longer, it was the military characters, instead. The role reversal is what shocked most of James Rollins fans, including myself. It has becoming more into Clancy and Dale Brown's ""thing"", which is not good, for Rollins has his own writing style, prior to Sigma Force series.The most serious disappointment is the role reversal and more fantastic improbabilities in his stories. Although this novel is quite good for most first time readers or non-Rollins avid fans, it was not so in my case. I have to heavy-heartedly placed a 3 star rating for this novel."
3,Fast Paced but needs some editing,"I agree with the other reviews on that this book has great action. The action sequences were fun, fast, imaginative and made this book a worthwhile read. Yes, there are definite ""angels and demons"" scences in the text and, yes, this is a scavenger hunt at its best, but overall a fun book. There are also times in the book that the characters say things unlike their character and more than a couple of times where Rollins over justifies why his character is acting the way they are. He does not trust his character development and throws redundant information at the reader instead of letting us enjoy his story. I did my best to ignore this and found myself satisfied with this read."
2,Boring,Not up to his usual good storytelling. Too bizarre a plot with too many half developed characters solving puzzles.
1,Just terrible,"Ugh. I guess I'm just not cut out to enjoy the work of James Rollins. I started with Sandstorm, which I was barely able to finish, and followed up with Map of Bones, which is just as bad as its predecessor. Both feature a team of ""good guys"" who know everything about everything. Both feature a secret underground group of ""bad guys"" who want to use some ancient relic to create some far-fetched Goldbergian super-weapon. Chaos (supposedly) ensues.The entire first half of Map of Bones felt like the set-up, like we were building toward the main plot, just about to hit that point when the action really kicks up. Problem was, that point never arrived. The plot never kicks into high gear, at least not as far as I could tell. It was chapter after chapter of slow, tedious, implausible buildup. There's no reason to compare this to The DaVinci Code; it's not even close. The plot completely resembles Sandstorm, which isn't a good thing at all."
4,"Better than da vinci, but different.","I have to say that James Rollins is a better writer than Dan Brown. His characters have more depth, and furthermore, his plots are more completely thought out. I've been disappointed in some of Brown's books, because although the action is fun, the plots are pretty lame. I just don't care if they found a meteor with fossils in it.Rollins however, has ventured away from his normal formula of taking people underground, throwing in weird creatures, and having the hero escape. It's nice to see him grow as an author, and hopefully someday he'll have movies made based on his books."
2,Very Slow and Repetitive,"I was very excited to read this book after sampling an online chapter, but was utterly disappointed half way through the story. The author has clearly copied Dan Brown's formula (and subtly, some of his ideas) and wrote a story that is a mixture of extremely detailed technical/sci-fi descriptions (similar to Michael Crichton's) and slow/repetitive 'action' scenes that go somewhat like this: ""When the enemy got distracted, he pulled a gun hidden on his boot. He lifted the gun. He turned his hand to point the gun to the enemy. He put his finger on the trigger. He slowly pulled the trigger. And the bullet crossed the space between the two of them."" Zzzzzzz... I'm giving two stars because the historical information in the book is quite interesting. However, the breaking of codes just doesn't flow with the story and the author could have easily trimmed the book down to 200 pages. This is the first and last James Rollins book I will read. Sorry!"
3,A pleasant evening's read... as long as you turn off your brain!,"James Rollins is clearly more at home with action stories than with thoughtful historical mysteries. Map of Bones is utter nonsense from an historical perspective, but a good read if that doesn't bother you. Another reviewer compared this to Umberto Eco's *Foucault's Pendulum*. I saw Rollins' book on sale and tried it.This is more for Robert Ludlum fans than for readers of Eco or even Kostovo."
2,Rainbow Da Vinci Six Code,"It appears the author did some research on the subject matter in the book and that was a little entertaining. The storytelling part was a little tedious though. If one combines Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six and Dan Brown's Da Vinci Code, one might end up with a book like Map of Bones. Simply put though, I was disappointed with this book and I don't know if I could read anything else by this author. (Sorry dude.)"
4,Works just fine!,"I used this glue only once so far on a 750 pieces puzzle, I only used 1 coat and it held just fine, I am planning on framing it.If you look closely one can see brush strokes, but I didn't see anything at the distance in which this puzzle should be looked at to appreciate the whole picture.This product comes with a lil' brush, really handy and clean.Overall it does what it should and that is all the matter!"
1,This glue dries but stays tacky after 5 days!,"Ok after 5 days it's still tacky. I even put it out in the sun to dry. Nothing I do will get rid of the tackiness.I've had cheaper glue that worked better.I would not reccomend that anyone buy this glue unless you want a tacky feeling puzzle.I did not overuse the amount of glue in fact for a 1,000 piece puzzle I had more than 1/3rd of the container left."
2,Good Enough But Nothing Special,The applicator is a plastic wand that makes it difficult to spread glue over puzzle surfaces. I ended up buying another brand and throwing this glue away.
3,Decent Introduction to Philosophy of Mind,"I picked up a copy of George Graham's introductory book upon a friend's recommendation. I have a little background in Philosophy and a degree in Cognitive Science, so I figured this would be an appropriate immersion into Philosophy of Mind. With the exception of a few witty jokes, this book is lacking of any new or clever ideas whatsoever, and does only a fair job explaining the rest.This book fumbles through topics, offering explainations and strange analogies when they are not needed, and glazes over more difficult topics. In many cases a topic will be left ambiguous and unresolved, and another will begin.It's a good book for a beginner without any background on Philosophy and ""the Mind""-- but still room for improvment."
5,Drive carefully your brakes are wearing unevenly!,"Your pulse is pounding and there are butterflies in your stomach as you sit on the starting line, engine revving, as your wait for the red lights to go out. Are you happy with your car's set-up? Have you planned your pit strategy? Are soft tires the best choice for this track? You have qualified well and are sixth on the grid. Around you are some of the finest race drivers in the world. The last light goes out and you press your foot to the floorboard, feeling your 700hp. machine leap forward. Hang on because driving a machine with a weight less than that of a mini and with all this power isn't going to be a drive in the park. The simulation is amazing but I advise utilizing all the features. FULL length racing on all the circuits with fuel consumption and tire wear ON. Also get the full experience by driving from the cockpit. Outside car views are for wimps!"
4,Tales...of the funky mechanised future.......,"Electronica from the golden age. Has that 'futuristic' feel. Cool ambience, starts off mellow yet intriguing. Would've appreciated a little more variation in the (faster) tempo speed toward the end of the album but is still decent stuff from a time when ideas seemed fresher than much of whats out there today."
4,Dave Angel - Tales Of The Unexpected,"How unexpected is Dave Angel's TALES OF THE UNEXPECTED? Well, it's chock full of gorgeous tech-house, so that's not unexpected. Deep grooves and Detroitian melodies? Also expected. The long, jazz-ambient start of ""Arabian Nights""? OK, that's unexpected. But it's a perfect intro (fear not, the beat eventually comes in, as expected). Indeed, it's the jazz influence that speaks the loudest, from the atmospheric breaks on ""Timeless"" to the vocal utterances set to a house thump on ""Scatman."" But, just in case, he goes back to solid techno with ""Over Here"" and ""It's Too Hot in Here"" and smoother Detroit tones with ""Bump."" Or, you could go with the percussive frenzy of ""Be Bop"" or martial drumming on ""Rudiments."" But the mellow grooves of ""D.O.B."" suit me better, I think. This, however, is not entirely unexpected."
2,"Monster Oil Paintings? Oh, brother...","Although I feel that this was a well-written book, I must say I was disappointed with the horrendous monsters featured in it. I mean, monsters made from oil paint? Come on!! The idea is just plain rediculous; it may have worked if the author found a plausible way of explaining them, but he failed horribly. This was one of three 8th Doctor books I bought, and after reading the others, I find myself extremely disappointed. The Doctor, throughout his entire history, has been a brilliant excentric. This new Doctor is, well, too normal for my tastes. He doesn't have the bizarre quality of past Doctors which made those personas truly wonderful to watch and read about."
2,READ THIS BEFORE YOU BUY THIS CD PLAYER!!!,"This cd player is ok, but for the money it is not. First of all just because it has 40 sec. anti-skip protection does not mean it is good. It has anti-skip MEMORY, not protection. What is bad about memory is if it is set to 40 sec, it takes 40 sec for the protection to be full. If it is shook at 5 seconds after it is set, it skips. That can really become annoying. If you also skip to another song, the skip memory starts from 0 then works it's way to 40 sec of protection. Other than that it is ok. It is quite big compared to other CD players. One other thing, it does not play CD-Rs or CD-RWs with the same quality of music as a regular cd. Also the skip protection does not work at all if a CD-R or a CD-RW is played. One plus is the headphones, they are good and comfortable. The other good thing about this player is that it also looks cool. Thanks for reading."
1,Get the 310 instead. It is superior and far more versitile.,"I'm with the other reviewer on this one. I'm not sure what advantages are offered by buying this router over the 310 model, except for a savings of about 15 bucks. The 310 is also compact but more powerful, and can be fitted with optional tilt and offset bases, whereas the 309 cannot. The base on the 309 is a smaller diameter than the 310, and thus is tall, skinny, and unstable. I'm really not sure why Porter Cable makes this router, as it seems an inferior redundancy to the 310. Don't buy cheese on your burgers for a month and spend the cash you save on a 310. Absolutely worth it."
1,buy a 310 instead,"why bother with this router? spend 20 bucks more and buy a Portercable 310 instead. Better housing, micro adjust. this tool is a copout from PC, I don't know why they bother making it."
1,Don't Do It!,This game is a pure nightmare! It has so many glitches that there is no way to enjoy it! The maps of the ER layout are impossible! You can't find your patients!!!
2,boring,"first of all, i think they should have got more different sinareos. Most of the time it was just the same thing, geting a pashent out of the wating room and geting them a bed, fixing them up and sending them out the door. Now that was fun the first hour but when it lasts 5, not so fun. It did have some changes in the sinaro, but not that much.This game has a good plot, but it needed to follow through with it.This game is worth no more than $20, max. I payed over $30 for this game, it wasn't worth it."
2,Don't waste your money,This game could have been a great game. If you want this game because of the medical aspect then this game is not for you. The game is too short and easy to beat. I guess it was made for the die-hard viewers of the show. Not a great game.
3,Not quite what I expected,"When I saw ads for this game I was really excited because I am such a big fan of the show. Overall, the game was pretty good. At first it was very addicting, I played it for like 4 hours straight. After that it started to get kind of redundant. I also found it to be really easy, and quite short. It only took me a few days to beat the whole game. It is very similar to the Sims, so if you like that you will like this game."
2,"Enjoyable game, but...","I really liked this game...let me start by saying that. I really did. However, two things bothered me greatly. First off, it is very clunky to play. I have a pretty darn good computer and this game would seize up often. Many reboots were needed to complete the game.My second complaint is that it was VERY short. I normally take a bit of time to complete a game, I finished this in around a week. I was stunned that it was over and thought that it may lead to a more advanced scenario, but nope.All in all, it was fun, but not worth what I paid due to the shortness of the game and the clunky interface."
1,"Stupid, pointless game","This is not a fun game to play. You basically just run around a hospital doing random boring tasks. Also, don't be fooled by it being called ""ER"" and being made by Legacy... YOU DON'T DO ANY MEDICAL PROCEDURES AT ALL; there is nothing scientific about the game. Well, at least in the first few levels; I uninstalled it after that.If you are a huge ER fan and aren't interested in the medical aspect of the show somehow, then perhaps you might want to buy it. Otherwise, don't waste your time or money."
4,ER made fun,"This game proved to be challenging and held my attention for hours on end. The possibilities are endless which adds to thechallenge of the game.Would highly recommend for anyone who is a fan of ER, and this game will prove entertaining long after the duration of the television show."
3,Not what I expected,I expected more decisions on how to treat patients..the people were hard to maneuver at times.The game is fun if you have a lot of time to spend on it..could not find a pause button-crutial for those with kids.overall--ok game-just not whjat I was expecting.
2,not what I expected,"I have over the years purchased a few emergency medical type games, and really do enjoy that genre, however this game doesn't even touch upon any skill one might have with diagnosing or even seeing patients. I guess what I had anticipated was a virtual setup of the television show, mixed with what had already come out, what I got was a point and click type atmosphere with virtually no challenge to the game whatsoever. If your looking for a point and click no brainer type RPG, it would be alright, however if your anticipating any type of challege look elsewhere."
3,ER Review,The game is fun but it is way too short. It wasn't what I expected it was gonna be. It wasn't worth what I paid for it. However I wouldn't say don't get it and play cause what there was of it was fun. Just wait for the price to go down.
4,Very intense,"I try not to kill people...lol.I click on a patient in the waiting/triage room to diagnose the injury or illness and severity of it, if a patient has an injury more severe than the skills I have, I have to assign a Dr. with more experience. If I have the skill level to treat the patient I assign that patient to a bed in one of the exam rooms and then go to that room to treat the patient. During the course of the game I am given orders from the attending doctors. Some of them, if not completed in the set amount of time are fireable offences(GAME OVER). But some if not completed, just go on my record. While trying to complete all these orders I am given. I eat when I can, sleep when I can, and shower when I can. And above all else, DO NO HARM.Like I said, it's very intense.It's so much fun"
1,Waste of Time - Running Vista,I have never had a problem with a older game working on my Vista OS until now. I bought this game for my New Dell Laptop running Windows Vista and it constantly freezes up. I tried to uninstall and reinstall the game with no luck. I also downloaded and installed the patches from Legacy's website and that didn't help. Waste of Time =(
5,ER--The Game,"I grew up watching ER on Thursday nights as a child, and I'm sad to see the show come to an end. I had the game before, but I never got to finish it. Unfortunately I lost the game, but I bought a new one on Amazon. It's a fun game. I wish it was a little longer game because I had gotten so far the first time I played it (before I lost it). The game somewhat realistic, but you can't actually do anything in great detail like some other games."
2,Would be fun...,"This game will only work if your computer is very updated. It only works for a few minutes on my computer, but if it did work well, it would be fun."
