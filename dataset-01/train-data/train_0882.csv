2,Turned rusty in less than 60 days,"I am very disappointed in this product. I had the exact same product from another manufacturer and used it for years without any sign of rust. Within 30 days of using this brand, it was showing signs of rust. I treated it no differently than the last one I had and I paid twice as much for this one. Unless you don't mind replacing your steamer every few months, I would look for a better brand."
1,Horrible,I've used several of these steamers over the years. They have generally lasted about 5 to 10 years. I'll be supprised if this one laste more than three weeks. It practically falls apart in your hands. Very cheap.
1,Not what they used to be,I've used Stainless Steel Steamer Baskets for many years and they have held up very well. Recently I needed a new one. I bought this one which looked exactly like my old one and maybe it is even the same brand but the quality definitely was not the same: one of the leaves separated immediately so I returned it. Amazon graciously sent a replacement. I have exactly the same problem with the replacement basket. The leaves are not secure. Big problem.
5,"A Boy, A Dog, and A Frog","I am 61 years old, and this is one of my top 20 all time favorite books. It is so funny! The author has a tremendous gift for telling a complete story without the use of words. Wonderful for the preschooler who wants so badly to read a real book. Be sure to check out the whole series, they are treasures to keep. When I read them, I always assume the role of the frog, I like his persistence!"
1,"Maybe Eisner is creative, but its ridiculous to call him a writer","Michael Eisner is the embattled CEO of The Walt Disney Company but is also in the spotlight of the not so flattering DisneyWar which was also published this year. Putting all Hollywood matters aside, this book is laughably horrendous in how it is conveived and executed. Most of Eisner's experiences are ""you had to have been there"" ordeals (and yes that very phrase litters the text.) Not to sound bias, but do parents really want their kids to turn out like Michael Eisner? And I know that currently this is the only negative review to be posted on this book, extremely suspicious since the critics lampooned it for its mawkish and mediocre writing. N.B.: All those who did write flattering reviews for Eisner only commented on this book alone. Interesting...."
5,Top 20 Reasons Why You Still Love Camp,"This sounds like a great book. I was just thinking about summer camp and not only came across this book, but this awesome post about camp. Thought you all would enjoy it! <...>"
1,Entirely awful book,"Great Expectations was perhaps one of the worst book ever written. I'm no Dickens' expert, but I do know a little about literature- I don't know how this even passed through the editing stage. It is slow-paced, boring, pointless, and an all-out waste of time to read. I have read challenging books with strong points like this before, and have sometimes enjoyed them, but never have I read a book this pointless and difficult to read, with such a stupid ending. DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY AND VALUABLE TIME ON IT!!!!!!!"
2,Lousy Binding,"I've read all but ""A Christmas Carol"" in this edition. I've found several typos. Moreover, the binding is becoming unglued. I estimate by the time I finish ""A Christmas Carol"" the binding will be totally exposed. I value permanent books (otherwise I would buy paperbacks). I suggest anyone who enjoys Dickens buy a better edition."
2,"If nothing else, it looks good on your bookshelf.","You would do better off buying these books individually from a different publisher.It sounds impressive, leather bound, gilded edges, but it is very cheaply done. On the plus side, it does have a ribbon book mark so you don't have to buy your own.But this book was poorly edited, filled with needless typos, and with all four of these books available from numerous other publishers, I would suggest to just buy it from them."
5,I thought it was a great book suitable for all ages.,Great Expectations was a great book. It was very interesting and it was hard to put he book down once you have started it. I recommend that you read the book if you enjoy good stories about the changes of life.
1,Pretentious,"Buying books because they look good on your shelf is pretentious and phony - and this book capitalizes on that. I got this as a gift and was amazed when I read it at the number of typos in it. There is simply no way this collection was proofed by an editor - that or the editing company is one of the worst in the world.Buy these fantastic books, but not this edition, unless you just want people to think you read Dickens."
5,It was a great book!,"It was a very interesting book! Many people think that it is boring but if you get into it, it is great!"
3,Boring Tiger,"I really had high hopes for this game, and at first it was pretty fun. But the graphics are poor, and the camera's constantly changing becomes frustrating. The story is the typical ""hero finds his past enough though he wasn't looking,"" and once you get to the monkey clan, the game has become boring. If I were you, I would rather play Ape Escape (which has better controller configuration of any game you could find)."
5,"Haydn Sym. No. 60, an incredible masterpiece","If you are a classical music lover, the Haydn 60th Symphony should be a part of your collection. Unlike most Haydn symphonies, this work is in six movements. The 6th movement, which is essentially a second finale, has moments where the orchestra sounds like it is simply warming up. It is hilarious. Also on this CD is the famous Symphony No. 22, nicknamed ""The Philosopher"". Instead of the usual format where the first movement is fast, here Haydn begins with a gorgeous slow movement, followed by a powerful allegro, a wonderful minuet and a great finale. One of Haydn's greatest symphonies. The third symphony here is No. 29. It is hard to believe that this very beautiful symphony is so rarely played or recorded. At the very low Naxos price, this CD is an exceptional bargain."
1,Blotchy and Uneven...,"Like the previous two negative reviews, I had the same experience. Contrary to what the reviewer who positively used this item stated, we DID use the pre-stain treatment recommended by Minwax and still had a terrible time with this stain. It is incredibly splotchy despite multiple different techniques we used to apply it. I had a feeling this product was too good to be true, and I was right. I would highly recommend taking the extra time and money to buy a can of good quality stain and a can of sealant. It is well worth it to not attempt to make this shortcut."
1,Make sure you buy a scraper at the same time...,"I bought a gun stock, which is made from Birch wood.I followed the directions on the Minwax Polyshades can to the letter, even letting it dry in my spare room to make sure it was warm enough (much to my wife's displeasure).I applied it with an old Tshirt to make sure that the coat was as thin and even as possible.Despite this, it is still impossible to get a streak-free finish, but I hoped that with a few coats, the color would even out.The can says that you can apply subsequent coats every six hours.36 hours after applying the first coat of Polyshades, my rifle stock still felt like it had been coated with maple syrup!I realized that it would take weeks to get a decent number of coats on the wood at this rate, so I scraped the crap off before it was too late.A few hours of scraping and a bit of sanding later, and my expensive stock is almost as good as it was before I made the terrible, terrible mistake of using Minwax Polyshades..."
3,ok if you dont care to see the grain too much,"not a pro by any means, but i can see where folks are coming from with the low ratings. doesnt enhance the detail in wood like real staining--thats a huge con. its basically a tinted poly. i was able to get an even tone using natural bristle brush. i did have to even out certain parts quickly with added strokes though."
1,Yes blotchy,"Thin coats.. yes.. tried that.. 2nd coat was a disaster.. scraped it off..someone must have been lucky.. got thick and splotchy for me almost instantly.if you HAVE to use it.. put on one coat only, but I recommend using a stain then clear poly."
2,A mediocre finish wax,"I tried this wax, but it is just just that.. wax.I have switched to polymer waxes in the last few years because they just last a lot longer. And now there are polymer based waxes that work with power waxers (like Meguiar's NXT Tech Wax). For hand waxing I use Liquid Glass, which I admit has wierd looking packaging but lasts for months, even in during the summer in the desert southwest.So if you are looking for some cheap wax to use with a power waxer, this might be for you, but maybe try some NXT and see the difference for yourself."
5,patrol,IFyou want to get a good book to read you should get Patrol by Walter Dean Myers.People might not like but it is good because it has great writting and a great setting.First you should read it has good writting.It is written in poetry form It also has a great setting. It is great because it is taken place in Veatnom.It is in a forest.It has tall grasses.All in all you should really get Patrol.
2,endorsed by Churchill China,"What a disappointment.This is a lame ""second"" class set.it's NOT the Good English made Churchill is was trying to match up to my old set.It's ok for the kids but not your Mother-in-law!"
5,Ah maze zing !,"This works wonders ! My 3 month old started teethin way early & has been so miserable , most medicine for teething is 4 months and older but this is perfect for her ! I have it to her & within 15 mins she was no longer cranky pants ! Lol it's amazing ! Def recommend"
4,"First-rate polished blues, top side men.","This is a first-rate endeavor from a great lineup of top shelf musicians. Can you say Grady Tate-drums, Phil Woods-sax, Paul Shaffer-piano et. al.? Very good selection of tunes to boot. I will enjoy this cd for years to come."
5,"irene is ""Grand"".","I thoroughly enjoy this cd and have played it many times since Ibought it a few months ago. It has a variety of tempos andbacking intrumental sounds, but it is all good. A great voiceand lots of enthusiasm eminate from the cd."
4,Solid album.,"Talk about a ""soul jazz legend"". Roy has entertained us for years with his beautiful melodic beats and fine lyrics. The record labels need to go ahead on and press some more of his fine works on cd. ""Vibrations, He's Coming, and You Send Me"" are just some of his best works that ought to be on disc by now."
1,what a scam,"This product was out of date by four years when I received it. I call that a rip off. I believe it should be, buyer beware. I would return it, but I have used it for almost a week. The company had put a cost strip over the date. After steaming that strip off, I found the date, 12, 2008, underneath."
2,Not impressive,"Have been using this product on my bounding for a month, i can only see a slight difference on my teeth (4-yr bounding) which is great but i am not sure the price is worth it."
2,YAWN...just another GU,"I can't believe Emerson left Underworld to do this....spinning the same old stuff as Digweed and Tenaglia. After 20 of these things, and I've got all 20, it's getting dull and predictable. They need some new blood or something. Stick with the Nu Breed series if you want to hear something a little different or the first 2 Prototypes...the 3rd is Ok and the 4th is plain awful. What happened, Seb? Keep buying GU's if you just have to have a 37th Oakenfold or a 25th Sasha set....whatever. I'm sure people will disagree with this since the MTV crowd has now finally gotten around to hearing Oakie and will be posting their insightful reviews...cant't wait. Peace."
5,interesting journey,"This album is very interesting. It has so many styles mixed into it, its as if u were listening to one of those 'clubber's guide to.."" compilations. Most of it is housey, funky, groove sorta stuff, though u get vocals,effects, and some synths in some tracks as well. So what the hell is this? well, who cares. it sounds good, its fast enough to keep u moving without being a cheesey. As much as i love this stuff i have to admit i miss trance. This may be the new style, or whatever.. progressive this progressive that. who cares. the whole electronica/dj scene is now so jaded its not funny. Anyways, this has a nice cover, nice packaging, quality quality quality. The bass on this thing is awesome. Great tunes.. very interesting mix. Expect the unexpected. Very unique sounding. Highly enjoyable. Original."
2,Darren tries to be different,"Given the volume of great progressive house mixes out at this point, I can see why Darren wouldn't go down that road, and it doesn't seem like his style. But I feel like I just bought some bad Ibiza compilation. I was pretty pissed listening to this on my headphones on my way home on the subway, debating whether or not to cross over to the uptown train to return the CD. At least uruguay had some bangin tracks like holy ghost or saints and sinners. From the opening accordion loop of disc 1, I knew I was in trouble. The beats are so ""housey"" I feel like I'm in a bad club in Cancun. I'm surprised he didn't mix in any Crystal Waters. Emerson has this archeologists approach to DJing, bring back old tunes and remixes, maybe to set himself apart. But I think this set just does not work. Go back to Underworld Darren and play nice."
2,Appetite for Trance,"Darren come on..what is this? After a swirly, extinquished release of the Uraguay piece under the GU label, which wasn't all that bad, I had some mild expectations before ever hearing this Singaporian tech-striden wrack. Quite frankly, this album should be dubbed a ""a festering journey through robotic lyrical noise."" Case taken, CD 1, song 9 entitled appropriately, ""B-Bop,"" goes as far as repeating the 80'esque breakdancing ""electro"" so much as to deliver a stitch in your side from laughing so hard. Are you kidding? With the exception of the 6th song (same disc) ""Do you like.."" which has a good underlying, successive rift pulse peppered with lighter stuff building on that, this album carries more indefinite articles than a legislative speech. Just one time and it's a headache. Best of luck getting through the first ""song"" on disc 2."
5,Great Thermos!,"Perfect for taking to work. Keeps my coffee hot. For those that like likes of coffee, get a bigger one. This holds about a large cup and 1/4 of coffee. But is perfect for me."
1,hi,I read this book years ago and loved it. I thought I would read it again all these years later even though I obviously did not remember much about it. I read it this time for about 10 minutes before I threw it in the trash. I guess I must have been a liberal freak back in my youth and did not realize it.
3,Use some caution,"I agree with a previous reviewer that this book has much to offer, but should be used with some caution. People's boundaries have changed. My personal experience in applying some of the lessons from this book is that people are often not fond of hearing self-disclosure and connecting experiences together interpersonally. People seem to like me better when I don't share much about myself and just listen to them and support them instead. Of course, too much of that makes for unbalanced relationships, but in our Hollywoodized, sound bite world, people aren't always ready for the real thing."
4,"Something a little different - and that's not a ""bad"" thing","I'd have to disagree with those who complain about Desmond being an ""anti-vampire"" as well as being a ""benevolent sugar daddy"" to young boy toys. Good grief, folks, where's your *imagination*! Sure, Mr. Dietz has created a vampire that doesn't follow the ""old rules"" about vampire folklore (which was, basically, a fiction in and of itself, one must remember). And no, Desmond isn't a terribly frightening character, unlike most of his violent, also fictional predecessors.But I really don't think it was Dietz' intent to write a great work of literary horror, so much as to write something that one can sit down and read, laughing at the funny parts, crying at the sad ones and just *enjoying* a very unusually touching story.Which I did.Who needs literary snobbery, anyways?BTW, this one's going on *my* recommendation list, for sure."
3,naive but satisfying,"Reading this book is perhaps like reading a beloved friend's autobiography: hardly a work of art, it never fails to keep your interest.Mr Dietz is not, in this first attempt at least, an accomplished writer: he explains too much, he gives many unneeded details at times while at others he is sketchy. And he bothers, ooohhh so much, about political correctness, to the point of being funny, at least for a European.On the other hand his story is not bad at all and with all its writing flaws he manages to suspend disbelief and to drag the reader into it. I came to care for Desmond, just as if he was a friend of mine. This is not a little achievement for an unexperienced writer.A bit of light, homoerotic reading, perfect for a rainy winter afternoon, and it shouldn't be out of print."
2,Desmond: too sappy and totally destroys the vampire legend,"Desmond is written as the anti-vampire, rather than as a vampire himself. Though he has a lust for blood, and regularly goes out ""hunting,"" his character is written in such a way that almost all conventions of vampire lore are tossed out the window (forget crucifixes, fire, water, sunlight, home soil... what's left?). It made this reader wonder why anyone would fear vampires at all! Indeed, there are characters in the book who welcome the opportunity to be hunted by this breed of vampire. The author appears to be a bigger fan of furniture than the paranormal/supernatural. So why two stars? Somewhat interesting use of historical background in describing Desmond's past generations. Limited to two historical eras. One last note: the dialogue and interaction between lovers in this story are sappy, overly melodramatic: parts of this story read more like a romance novel."
4,"Great Story, but not really in the Vampire Genre","I thought this book was a great read. However, it's really more of a gothic romance type book than vampire novel.Desmond is a ""good"" vampire. while some vampire purists may balk at the concept, you have to realize that the fact that Desmond is a vampire isreally little more than a plot device. The book is really a tragic romance novel.I look forward to a sequel, but hope that if one is written, the author takes a little more time to focus on things like the vampire physiology in his universe. He throws out a lot of the conventional vampire weaknesses, but never goes into much depth on how they actually work. Likewise, the concept of vampires having ""life cycles"" is a fascinating idea, but needs more in-depth explanation."
5,I am VERY UPSET!!!!!!,i am on page 285 of Desmond and i am feeling that Tony is going to die..IF HE DOES i am going to be very upset..this is one of the best novels i have read in a long time and i am so yearning for this thing to come out well. i have afeeling it is not going to. i would love to have the kind of love that Desmond and Tony have. yes i know that it is is only a fiction novel but i identify so much with these characters that i really want them to wind up together happy and in love.....please mr. dietz ????????????????????????????????????????????????
3,Interesting but low quality technically,"The DVD gives a good impression of several empty hand and kobudo kata as teached by the late Odo Sensei, who was a famous okinawan karate master. Odo sensei doesn't perform the kata at full speed and force, but in a very relaxed way, just to show the sequence of movements. However, the group of karateka in the dojo perform very poorly, which at times is really hilarious. That is regrettable and does not honor this respectable Sensei. For those interested in the Okinawan kempo system this is an interesting DVD."
1,Defect in finish,"While this item did arrive in a timely fashion, and it was well-wrapped, the finish is defective and it does not have a ""new"" sticker as these pieces usually do. Disappointed. Will seek replacement with new item in new, first rate condition."
1,suuuuuuucked,"Based on fantasy, it was 24 Mins, after all the credits and titles instead of 30 Mins of crap. film quailty was not very good. content lacked any substance."
3,Picture from the Cold War,It is an easy to read book with short stories of what happened in Berlin during the cold war and how the citizens of the divided Berlin they had to manage in a desperate and dramatic situation. It provides a nice political picture of the cold war period.
4,"Great, but a suggestion","Really like that this keeps my dogs tags quiet (especially when I'm sleeping). Might be nice if the designer put a clear plastic window on there so the tag can be read without removing the tag silencer. That also would help make the tags more obvious in case the dog was lost. Overall though, great!"
4,Enjoy the silence!,"Great product! Good conversation piece, too. Do not fit the wider tags well, but they are stretchy. Words are reflective, too."
2,Quit using,"I bought this mainly as a means of insulating the metal tags on our dog's collar from the electrodes on his electric collar when I put it on. I only put the electric collar on when he is in the yard. It worked for that but I have discontinued using it. Even on our 35# dog it is is bulky and he repeatedly was able to get it in his mouth to start chewing it. If you must use something I think tape would be a better and much cheaper solution.Bought directly from seller. Experience was positive. At my request they made last minute color change, confirmed this by Email and still shipped the same day. Shipping was free, unlike Amazon."
3,Works as expected,"Length:: 0:30 MinsThis is my dog experiencing a full on belly rub.Bottom line, does what it is supposed to do, cuts out all tag jingling and keeps tags together. I worry that it will be a little difficult to get off if somebody should need to read the tags. Also, my white short-haired dog's hair sticks to the black case. In addition, I have a 44lb dog with a large neck, but this would be far too large for my other dog (20lb). A good solution to the annoyance of mandatory tags."
5,Finally!!,"Omg. Quiet Spot has been sooooo helpful. I have a 4 month old boxer puppy and he looooves to run and play. My family kept getting irritated at all the noise his tags made. He has his personal ID tag in the shape of a bone, a city tag in the shape of a firehydrant, and a rabies tag in the shape of a heart. All very different shapes and sizes. It got to the point where I never put his collar on because of all the noise(and complaining). Now he can run and play as hard as he wants and there is no jingling. Even he seems happier to not have jingling going on. Quiet Spot is very handy and extremely flexible. It's even reflective! Quiet Spot is my new best friend!"
3,Not as great as I expected,"I like the *idea* of this product, but it didn't work as well as I expected. When I put it on my older shih tzu's tags, he kept trying to grab it, and the puppy's teeth got stuck in the nice, soft neoprene material when she played with her big brother. It would probably work better on a medium to large sized dog. For my small dogs, I found that wrapping the tags with a velcro cable tie did the job without any problems."
4,Sweet silence!,No more dog waking up the baby when he shakes his collar and me wanting to strangle said beloved pooch.
1,Disappointed,I was disappointed with this product. The length guide came apart in my hands right out of the box. Never went back together properly after that. All the accessories are cheap plastic that do not fit onto the trimmer properly. After one use the battery compartment door would not close properly. I have owned WAHL products in the past and have been reasonably satisfied but this item is not worth the money.
2,Battery killer.,"Cuts very well. Nice and sharp! Its small size makes it great for travel, but not so good for regular use because after every 2 or 3 uses, I have to change the battery. It eats batteries so fast, you can hear it slowing down the moment you start using it. You'll do much better to get a rechargeable one."
3,Quirky,This device works fine if it is turned on and operating. The power switch is quirky. Sometimes it turns the device on and sometimes not. I just keep trying and sooner or later it has come on. I think that it will eventually die.
1,Doesnt work,"Took it out of the box, put the battery in, didnt switched on. Tried a different battery still didnt work.Sending back for now, Will update the review after recieve a new one."
5,Stylish,"Even as period-instrument bands dominate baroque music performance today, many small chamber orchestras demonstrate that it is possible to give stylish, restrained, crisply articulated performances of baroque music on modern instruments. When I compare this rendition of the Bach Magnificat to a period-instrument, one-singer-to-a-part version with Andrew Parrot on Virgin, the latter comes off sounding like a parody of authentic performance practice (rushed tempos, pallid vibrato-less tone, ugly lunging swells on suspensions) while this Naxos version sounds like a model of good taste and fine music making - from orchestra and vocal soloists alike."
4,Gould makes natural science a fun read.,"Gould makes clever analogies & comparisons of natural sciences with common things around us. Most of the topics he covered would be a bore to read by itself but Gould masterfully entertains & educates with his adroit prose & humorous side comments.It is a bit on the long side and some of his comparisons used fads of the early 90's which are not relevant today; but all in all, the book is a winner."
3,Needs editing,"I enjoyed several of the essays in this book. To me, they were fresh and insightful and interesting reading.Then I got to read another essay on the same topic, then another. The organization of the book is such that reading it straight through bored me to death.Gould could stand to edit some of these roundabout tales down and get to the point a little quicker. The thoughts are thoroughly interesting, but they are buried in long-winded prose."
2,not soo fun,"This game was cool at first but then it started to get boring. You just wake up in the morning and go to school. You get to have a job but you can't see yourself doing it at all. You just shop and talk to people. It's a waste of time. You can't have a real boyfriend or actually do something like if you ask a friend to go to the pet shop, 2 seconds later the game says ""went to pet shop"" The things that you buy for your room like the TV, video game console, or DVD player, u can't even use! It's soooo boring. You do the same things every single day. Soo if you're planning on buying it... it's not a good idea."
2,BORING,"I was really excited about getting this game BUT, when I finally got it was really fun at first but after 10 game days I realized you just keep repeating the same things over and over and over, it got REALLY BORING. I think everybody who gave it 5 stars must have only played the game for a minute or not at all."
1,Don't buy this game!!!,"My daughter begged and begged for this worthless game. It is a waste of money!!! It is no fun,boring.Don't buy this game!!!"
2,My daughter found this game boring,"I bought this for my daughter for her 11th birthday. After playing the game once, she asked me if I could take it back. She said that the game was boring because it was so limited as far as what you could do in the game. My daughter has always played a lot of ""simulated life"" video games (i.e., the Sims, Animal Crossing) and online games (i.e, club penguin). I suspect this is why she found this game limiting. Other games that she has played portray a more intricate ""life"" and therefore draw the player in to a greater degree. My advice would be to consider what your daughter is used to before buying this. If your daughter has no experience in these types of games, this game will probably be fine. However if your daughter has previously played simulated life games, she will probably find this one lacking."
3,"Fun, but could be better...","Dreamlife is such a fun game, you go through the entire school year including friends, school, shopping, and crushes, and you even have chores! The game is so much fun when you're meeting new people, going to school, etc. But, I have a few complaints. First, I hate that the game repeats basically everything, the only different thing from day to day, is parties, new people and some stuff at school, but this didn't keep my interest 100% of the time I was playing it. Second, I got bored a lot of the time I was playing it, I do admit I was addicted to it, but to tell the truth it wasn't all that fun. Third, after you finish the school year, the game ends, and THATS IT! There are no new surprises. You just have to start the same game over again. I was totally disappointed. I expected so much more out of this game. But not everything in life turns out the way you want it to. I gave this game 3 stars, its fun but could be better."
5,u should buy it,"i love this toy! it keeps me entertained for hours! i dont know what id do with-out it! its not the most educational game but it fun,cool and awesome! ITS A REALLY GOOD GAME FOR GIRLS!"
4,This toy is ok,i bought this toy for [...] 2 days ago. I didnt listen to my cousin when she said that at first the game is fun but then it gets boring. You dont even get to see the actions or go to your sports tournaments. The sims are so much better because you can actually see what they do. I couldnt even buy the computer and cell phone because i needed permission from my parents they never said i could get it and i nevereven saw them! well if you want to buy this buy it but wait until the price goes down
2,The toys no Dream Life,"At Christmas I recieved the toy, because I wanted it so much I hooked it up to my TV and played it. First of all when you go to school it just says ""went to school""!! Yoou don't learn anything by playing this game. When you do a sport you just click it and says ""practiced sport or won tournament"". You can go shopping at the mall like 8 stores and when your closet gets full you have to sell stuf!!!!!! You can only play to different games on Dream Life and then you have to delete them. You also can't have a real boyfirned you just have boys that like you. And when a friend asks you to go to a party and you say yes you don't actually go, same with school dances. This game was like fun for the first 3 days after I got it, but now I don't even play anymore. You should not by this game i isn't fun and it costs to much. Please take what I said into consideration."
3,"Great fun, but not so great durability","I am 12 years old and used to own this.I had to return my game because every time I played it, it would freeze up.I changed the batteries and still nothing.I loved it though!!!"
5,Dreamlife.,This was a brthday present for a friend. They loved it vey much and even invited me to play it. Based on the fact they loved it so much I give it five stars.
2,Once,This is not very intresting. I only used it a few times and i got it for my birthday. It's over priced.
2,Not what she thought it would be..,"My 12 year old daughter asked for this for her birthday. I got it for her. She thinks it sucks. Gameplay time goes very fast. You get ""a month"" per character. When the month is over, you have to make a new character and start completely over. It's a waste of time and not a good one."
4,good buy,I ordered DreamLife for my 9 year old daughter for Christmas. It is really easy to set up and easy to use. She will play with it or about 45 minutes to and hour at a time. She seems quite happy with it. I have spent about 30 minutes playing it. I do see some of the same questions come up maybe too often. We are happy with it.
4,Adictive,"Dream Life is so cool. I saw it on TV and I just had to get it. It was Christmas at the time. I got it from Santa (For non Santa belivers let's just say it was from your dad for now). Anyway, I was so happy when I got it. I played it for hours... I was glued to it. Your BFF occasianaly asked you if you have a crush on a boy in the programming. But on the down side it gives you boring conversastions but all and all the game is pretty good."
5,It Really Is A Dream Life!,"I had to buy it with my own money, but I love it! You create a dream you, create your room and your best friend. You can sign up for activities, go to the mall, go to your bff's house, go to the salon, and go to school. There are parties and dances. You get a lot of money for doing chores, though. This game teaches you that you have to work to get money and that homework and tests are important. This game may freeze sometimes, and I do agree it should be more like [...]$. Overall, it's a fun game for girls and i absoulutly love it!"
5,Awesome game!!!,"Okay, I'm fifteen years old, and I love this game. It seems weird for me saying this, but I always wanted a game like this when I was growing up. I remember we had giga pets and furbies. If I had this toy when I was younger, I would have loved it even more! I totally recommend it."
3,it's ok...,"at first it was awesome! but then your friends started saying the same things over and over, your wardrobe got full really fast, and when you play a lot, you have to start over !! If i were you, i would rather buy designer's world or dig makeover instead!"
5,Wow Its so so great !!!!!!!!!!,When I first played this game it was ok. But now it is amazing i love it. u can talk to people go to dances (boys u like can ask u to dance). You have to be able to read though. You can name ur girl and choose wat she looks like( my girl is so beatiful!) also you have to do chorses to go shopping> i think shopping in this game is so awson! i hate shopping in real life but in this game it rocks! no lie about how good this game is. My girl amy likes chris (he likes her) if u r a girl buy it now. even if u are a tom boy u will love this easy but fun game. i think i have said enough! if u buy it u wont be dissapointed(i wasnt) well bye and say hi to this amazing game.
2,So So,"My daughter used this twice for about 2 hours each time. She enjoyed it, but after about 4 hours she was bored and had done everything on the machine. It crashed twice due to not enough memory. So So, spend your money elsewhere. . ."
4,My daughter loves this!,My 9 year old daughter can't seem to get enough of this! I thought it was kinda dumb @ first but now I get into it with her.
4,DreamLife,"If you have a child who loves to spend time in a fantasy world of fun . . . than DreamLife is for you. It's easy to set-up and operate. Plus, it introduces them to the responsibilities of working and choosing the right friends. My daughter has had hours of fun on this game!"
4,No Title,I saw the commercial on the tv and I realy wanted it.Now I'm not so sure because some people said it is boring.I think I will still get it though.It does sound like a realy cool game.If you get bored of the game you could play another game that you already have for a few days and then play Dream Life again.It probably won't be that boring anymore because you have not played it for a while.Those of you who said the game was boring after a few days try what I just typed before.
1,Beware!!!,This game seemed like so much fun and the comercials were convincing and everything!It was fun at FIRST then I got REALLY bored!I'm so upset now because I payed for this with my money and then my friend's B-day came and after all that I only have like 20 bucks left and I don't get allowence!The only thing you can do in this game is shop for little nick nacks in your room that you CAN'T use and clothes!And then when you've bought too many clothes your wardrobes full and the game won't let you buy any more clothes!!!This game also uses A LOOOOOOOOOT of battery power!Just don't buy it!
2,Has some kinks in it,"I bought this for my nine year old daughter. The game in theory is great, but ours does not work right, and the company is not real great to deal with. I am still trying to get a replacement. If the game worked properly, I would rate it 5 stars, easily. Even my thirteen year old daughter loves it."
5,this toy is so cool,This toy is so cool.You get to buy and join stuff in this game i think this game is awsome!
3,WOO,"You can't walk around. And all you frigging do is talk!.You can.......MAKE YOUR BESTEST FRIEND!!!!!!!! WHOOP-DI-DO!!!!!!You can.......TALK! AND TALK! AND TALKDY, TALKLDY TALK! WOO! THIS IS FUN!.........................................Then, You get MONEYS from your ''Parents'' Who you never see in this game to go buy SOME NEAT STUFF(...)"
3,ehhh..........,dream life is really fun when you get it but then you finish the game and start playing it over and over and over and over it starts to get real boring
5,worst game ever (i gave it 5 stars because everyone gave it one and its amazing that an item got so many 5 satrs),"anyway, this is a lousy item. all you do is go to school. make stupid friends and have a boyfriend. that is way over 13. this item needs coolness. like to make a boy! im a girl but im just saying! and shopping!! its so girly girl. i hate shopping. i love snow boarding and hey i love skirts as much as the next girl but the skirts sre way too short. it gives kids bad ideas about flirting and boys and clothes that should be worn by sluty rock stars. sure you all LOVE it. all those girls who love shopping and stupid girly girl things. like hitting on boys and getting GIRLFRIENDS. OMGOSH! give it up! this product is for certain girls and you know who you are."
4,Really cute game for girls,My 10 year old daughter and 6 year old niece love playing this game.It's easy to play and setup. The graphics are good. I like the ideathat the players are allowed to earn money by doing their homeworkand chores. The players also interact with freinds they create.Andof course there is shopping.
3,It's ok... not great,"I'm 13.. at first, the game was SO COOL, you choose your clothes, your bf, your bff, etc. BUT after a while (about 3 weeks) you get everything done and you have to start over (with another doll), you can't actually continue your game... so you would be doing the same things over and over."
1,I would like to buy this game.,"Dream Life seems a lot like the game Sims. (I love that game.) This game looks very interesting on the advertisements. I would like to buy it. But compared to the game Sims, it seems like it's for little kids. I'm 12 years old. Based on the other reviews, it sounds ok even if you are 12.The reason I gave 1 star is because the ads don't tell much about the game. But hopefully, I will find out more by reading the other reviews!"
5,THE BEST GAME EVAH,"OMG tihs lookz sooooo kewl. i dont habe it yet buuuut it loooookz sooooo kewl!! i mean you can do soooo much stuff and i know its goin 2 b awsome!! im going to get 100 boyfreinds becuz im goin to make myself sooo hott on the game just liek i am in real life. but seriusly, this game loks sooooo kewl. i HAVE 2 get it today. right now!! could someone buy it for me? by the way i am 14."
5,Dreamlife game,"My daughter got this for Christmas, since it was on the top of her list. I got it from Amazon, and worried it would be damaged and would have to go through the hassle of sending it back. I got this for only twenty-eight dollars then, and can't believe what they're charging for it now! Needless to say, this was my daughter's favorite gift. She is eleven years old, and my other daughter is seven, and they both play on it. They take turns naming themselves, and getting new 'friends'. This game is a 'dreamlife' as the kid gets too much money per chore, some get twenty dollars just for washing dishes. Anyway, they love it. The graphics are really cartoonish, since it's not a computerized game. All in all, it's worth their time playing it. There's no violence, so that was a plus. Try it, you might like it."
2,dissapointed,"My daughter really wanted this game. She thought it sounded so cool. She bought it with her own money.She was so excited to play because she was under the impression she would decorate her room, go to school,parties,shopping hang out with friends. and it was very dissapointing. There are very few things that you actually do and the rest they just tell you youve done.Its very repetitive and not much fun."
4,READ THIS COMMENT EVEN THOUGH I'M JUST A KID!!,"I am 12 and a half years old and i still find this game wonderful and educational. If your daughter is going through a tough time or having problems this is a great way to escape and get away. This game teaches you that you need to work for nice things and participate in stuff , like sports and other acivities. All the parents are saying that its not good that it has boyfriends and dances but for one thats all about growing up. I beilive it sort of prepares us what is coming up in life. Your child does not have to have a boyfriend in this game or wear a mini skirt. I think this game is great for girls becoming young women."
5,"DREAM LFIE ROCKS, AND IF YOU DON'T HAVE IT NOW, GET IT SOOOOOOOOOON!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","Dream Life is a really awesome and cool and fun game. It's educational, too. In order to get money to shop with, you can get a job at the buliten board at the school, and you have to do chores at home, too. When you get good grades on a test, your parents in the game will give you money and permission to buy stuff like a T.V., computer, phone, and much more, too. Dream Life is educational, fun for kids, and EVERYONE that has it, definitely LOVES it alot. You can make friends, and boyfriends. Youc an go to parties, too. My Dream Life girl had 3 boyfriends, a boy ahd a crush on her, and she went with her boyfriends to parties, and they asked her, and she asked them, too. Dream Life is awesome, so you should reall get it."
5,a MUST buy game!!!!,"I got this game on the first day of Chanukkah and it rules! You pick a name and design your girl's look. You can make her one best friend and then make friends at the school, salon, mall, or rec center. You can have friends, BFF's, or crushes. You can go to dances and parties. But you can't always live a glamorous life. You do chores for money and study for good grades. If you get good grades, you get T.V's, phones, DVD players, computers, or video games. Every day when you wake up, the game automatically saves. Sometimes, the game freezes, but it's okay because you can reset it. Me and my sister (10 and 8 year olds) play the game every day. We can't put it down. We used to be computer freaks and now we're Dream Life freaks. Put this game #1 on your wish list because this game,is a true MUST BUY!"
5,Dream Life Rox!!,Hey ok so Ii dont have the game yet but based on what im hearng this games pretty AUESOME!! If you have nothing to do you could just get out ur dreamm life. Don't pay attention too people who give it one two or three stars. This game is cool because you get to go to the mall make your room BOYFRIENDS!!Ok dont worryif u dont want one u dont have to get one.but my piont is this game rox and when u get it youl see!
3,Not worth the money,"My daughter played with this toy for about 2 months and then tired of it. We put it away for awhile and took it out again. Now, the toy will not work. It shuts off in the middle of the game and parts of the animation disappear from the screen. We replaced the batteries, but it still does not work properly."
5,this is a cool cool and awsome toy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I really want this toy and I don't have it but my mom is thinking about to buy this for my brithday aor chirstmas or just buy when i am aloud to get a toy. IT's awsome and my brother thinks it is not cool at all because hr is 13 teen and i am 10 so i really want this toy my cousin is going to be mad when i get it.
2,this toy is horrible,i Bought this thinking yay this is going to be so cool u can do so much but i was wrong all u relly can do i shop and tlk to poeple u dont see yourself at parties and u dont see your self doing the sports u signed up for so all u do is wake up in the morning go to school wich u also dont see your self doing anything at then after school u talk to someone and then all u can do is shop for clothing its so boring so if u wana buy this dont it looks cool but its not!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
3,Not as fun as you think it is,This game is awsome but it gets a little boring you can only have a certain amount of cloths and stuff REALLY BORING AFTER AWHILE so I only gave it 3 stars but dont get me wrong its a fun game
2,Do not by this GAME!!!!!,OK so My mom bought this game for my 12th Birthday well I was so Excited Because on the commercial it looked so fun when I got it Me and my friend set it up. Well the first week it was fun but then it just got Boring you don't even get to do the Activities or when you ask the friend you want to go to the Mall It just says you and Jessica had a lot of fun. Final Review don't waist your money For this game. It's now in my closet collecting dust.
4,Great game with some disappointment,"My 8 year old daughter received this from Santa Claus & it was ahuge success until it stopped working. She only got to play it for a few hours before it stopped working. We changed batteries & the problem still wasn't resolved. When I sent it back to Santa's workshop, he didn't have anymore available. Imagine thedisappointment she feels. It is a great toy if the quirks canbe worked out at the manufacturer. My 14 year old son even commented that they needed one for guys. One more thing, there needs to be more choices of places to go & do."
5,This product works!!!,"I have compared several mattifiers lately, and the only 2 that don't contain oil (crazy, considering they're supposed to absorb oil), or list water as the chief ingredient are Peter Thomas Roth and Dr. Brandt. Dr. Brandt's dries much quicker, and I love the tint, and the tea tree oil is definitely a plus. The Roth mattifier contains less than 10 ingredients, though, so for pure and poreless skin, go for one of these products and skip over water and oil containing mattifying products like Smashbox Photo Finish."
2,Ummmm....,"After reading all the great reviews I was so excited to get the cream! Well, it did not live up to expectations..AT ALL!!! If you have sensitive skin, dont even try it! Within a week my face was so read and started breaking out! It is also not good to wear under makeup b/c it doesnt absorb well. I am now trying Murad and I hope it works!"
5,Let's Meet The Livingstons,There are many descendants of the subject of this book that would love to purchase a copy. This book is an excellant resource for genealogical research.
5,I own one,"Konica Minolta Dimage A2 with Anti Shake Optical Zoom.I own this camera,it was an upgrade from a Minolta Dimage 404 and I love it.I took a cross country trip in September and the the camera performed teriffic in numerous lighting contitions.The Anti Shake feature alone is worth the price.I recommend having several batteries,I carry 3 so that I can having one charging all the time.I also have 512mg compact cards,big pixils you will need large media cards"
3,Product Photography,I am inexperienced and have found this camera difficult to use for capturing images of products. The white adjustment is not automatic and must be tuned each time.
5,excellent camera,"""Playing"" with this camera for a couple of hours before returning it to the store does not give oneself sufficient time to really appreciate what the A2 is capable of. Macro, lens,build quality,battery life,EVF,features & functions,manual zoom & anti-shake all add up to stunning results when you LEARN how to use this camera to it's full potential."
1,poor repair service in the US!,"Both of my LCD's (viewfinder too!) went completely blank after 2 weeks of use during my learning period. I had to sent my almost new A2 to Minolta repair center in NY, and it has been waiting for repair for over 4 weeks!Their service center is the only one in the US and it seems they don't even have spare parts to fix A2's. They have been waiting for ~4 weeks just to get some spare part and all they can ""guarantee"" is up to another 4 weeks of repair time! I am wondering if I am just unlucky or other A2 owners shared the fate. With all the respect to many possitive reviews I have seen for A2, I will never buy Minolta again because of their service. It's not exactly a cheap camera to get such a poor support.There are other A2 users reporting problems with this camera (just google Dimage A2 problem), so maybe it's anot an accident and Minolta has some production quality issue with A2."
5,f,"The book was in very good condition and came right away, but the packaging could use some help. Fortunately my book was not damaged but it could have been..."
2,Nine systems compared with New York's,"I bought this book expecting to find interesting, coffee-table-type pictures and chatter on 10 subway systems of interest to me, and ended up writing a letter of criticism to the publisher. Almost all of them are compared (usually negatively) to the author's hometown system of New York. The two systems that received the greatest complaint from the author are Chicago and Toronto, Chicago for having a low proportion of subway mileage in its total, and Toronto for not having express tracks. The pictures in this book are mostly from the last 20 years (although little effort was made to identify when in that time the pictures were taken) and are generally fairly limited in their variety. In all I was somewhat disappointed with this book; good thing it was inexpensive."
4,This is truly written history.,"The book details the life of a convict almost 100 years ago. The true punishment of the convict when weight rooms and cable tv were not given to those placed in prison for wrongdoing. Today's convict should be made to read how things were done 100 years ago and be thankful that they are treated much better. Cole Younger's chapter is a great asset to the book. He tells of his life behind bars and his version of the Northfield, MN bank robbery that sunk the infamous James-Younger Gang for good. If you like history, you should get this book as a part of your personal library!!"
3,Melon head,These are made for people with huge heads. Not for normal folks. I use them but if I bend over they fall off.
4,Good work glasses.,"I love these glasses for work. I just wish they had more of a selection in the magnification. I would rater have .5, but 1.0 work ok. I am replacing an old pair that have been very durable, and only wore out because of my own carelessness. Good product."
4,Very good product,"These glasses do an excellent job of eye protection and the built-in reading glasses are invaluable in letting me see my work. Considering the relatively low price I feel they represent a great value. My only complaint is that I wish they covered a bit more of the eye area. They protect eyes fine, but the area below the eye can be very sensitive and it would be nice if they came down a bit more."
4,Great safety Glasses,I am a machine mechanic and I ordered 2 pair and they are great. Now I don't have to change to my reading glasses when I'm looking at the fine print.
5,Great Glasses,"Purchased the clear ones based on my experience with the smoked version. For those of us that need a corrected safety glass, these are a great product at a good price. The bifocal is low so it doesn't interfere with normal vision lines. They are comfortable for all day usage.As for the protection sleeve, it took me awhile (actually the wife did it) to figure out that only the lenses fit in the sleeve (the bows hang out). It seems a reasonable solution but in reality the bows tend to get caught on things when the sleeved glasses are clipped to a tool belt."
3,Bifocal safety glasses,"Optical quality of the lenses are mediocre at best. I have to put on my ""real"" glasses when doing any real layout work. I'm a bit disappointed with the product. I guess they do protect my eyes......"
5,I did not know they made them. Love them.,"I use them when working in the shop. And will give them a try when shooting at the range. Some times you just need a little better close up vision and at the same time eye protection. What would be ever better than the small area on the bottom, would be a full area all along the bottom. Anyone seen that type?"
5,Old Guys Rule With These Glasses,I have several pairs of these in my shop and at home for landscaping or outside work. Light scratch resistant. Use a cleaning solution and they stay fog free as well.
2,Nose Pieces Fall Off,"Nice pair of safety glasses except the nose pieces fall off. If I buy another pair, I'll try gluing the rubber nose pieces on. I bought 3 pair, and all of them have fallen off, never to be found. Too bad."
1,Don't buy these!!!,I received these glasses and they don't fit my head and flimsy as all hell. Also the distortion in the bi-focal transition is hideous with the bi-focal lens ending up in your line of site vision. I bought these for night riding my motorcycle and the quality and customer service is total junk. I tried returning them....They want me to ship them back at my cost (cost more than the glasses are worth) and they won't refund me until they are able to resell them....meaning I will lose the glasses and my money. Look somewhere else and lesson learned with these clowns!!!!
2,Good Glasses....Sucky Retailer,"Good price, usual fast ship though I ordered 2 pairs, only one came. Emails and phone calls to to both the retailer and Amazon have gone unanswered.....C'mon guys - just ship the other pair or offer a credit; this isn't hard to satisfy the customer on this one....."
4,Wrong product received twice.,"I've always been happy with Dewalt products. It's Amazon.com's service that I question.The Dewalt glasses are fine. However, I ordered the smoked lens glasses and received the clear lens glasses. Yet, both my submitted order and the invoice that I received state smoked lens glasses. I called to have the correct product mailed to me and was assured that the correct pair of glasses would be sent out immediately. Again, I received the wrong pair of glasses.I do not plan to use Amazon.com again because of their inablity to provide me with the correct product."
1,Worthless,I get these safely glasses hoping to use them for small intricate work but found them to be less then useless. I recommend any kind of head mounted magnifying glass over these if you plan on doing anything more than reading small text.
5,EXCELLENT FOR WORK,USE DAILY NO INTERFERENCE FROM BI-FOCAL LENSE.USE IN LAB SETTING AND SIMPLY PUT ON TOP OF HEAD WHEN NOT IN USE AND THEY STAY THERE.
3,These are for work situations,I thought I could get buy wearing these in normal everyday life. They look like safety glasses. That is what they do.
1,Uncomfortable,"These went in the drawer when I received them, and I will only use them in a pinch, or let someone else use them! Very uncomfortable in my opinion - not a good design."
3,Great Lens - VERY large frame,"Ordered these for a new job requiring safety glasses at all times. Arrived as promised, with a nice foam padded ""protection sleeve"" for storage. Lenses are superb quality - noticably better clarity than any other brand I've tried since. Just wish the frames were available in different sizes, as these are sized for a larger-than-average head size, and they are enormous on my face (I normally wear a 7 3/8 hat size). Because of the wide frames, they rub against the insides of my ears and I can't wear them. It's a real shame, as these are otherwise high quality glasses."
2,Great concept but...,"I liked the premise of bifocal safety glasses and realize that it may take some time getting accustom to using them. My work takes me to the production floor of various manufacturing facilities. I have found it difficult and in some case's a safety hazard performing normal things such as going up and down stairs. For me, the ""magnifier"" part of these safety glasses is too high. Unfortunately they do not have an adjustable nose bridge or temple setting. So in order to get the magnifier area low enough I need to put them much lower on my nose, which in some sense defeats the purpose of wearing safety glasses in the first place. Another complaint is that the inside edges of the lenses stick out slightly further than the rubber nose piece. After a couple of days of use the bridge of my nose was sore. On the positive side the quality of the lenses are good and had no issues with the seller."
5,Just what I needed,"I started a job that requires precision grinding. Being kind of old, I have a hard time seeing things that are close to my face; however, these bifocals fixed that problem."
2,Uncomfortable,"Nose pads are serrated and bite into your nose. Although the glasses don't slip, after a short while they leave marks and become irritable. Otherwise, the glass quality and bifocal area are good."
5,Great for work,DeWalt usually puts out a good product and I wasn't diappointed in this lightweight pair of safety glasses. I use it all the time at the assembly line. I'm sorry I didn't get a pair for home use.
5,Dewalt Shop Glasses,These wrap around glasses work very well for me since my cataract procedures. The clear plastic gives good distance view while the magnifying bifocal part is positioned low enough for me to see what my hands are doing. Safety glasses are required at my community's wood working shop.
4,Good bifocal safety glasses,"I now own several pairs of these bifocal glasses, both clear and sunglasses. They work well as safety glasses, and I like the sunglasses for regular use as well, especially for driving. It's nice to have good wrap-around type sunglasses and you can also clearly see the dashboard. Like most safety glasses, they will get scratched up somewhat in the shop and when doing construction work, especially when doing gritty-type work, like concrete or tile sawing and setting. If you take special effort to clean them often in running water, this will extend the usable life substantially.The one failing is that the rubber nose pieces can slide off if you're not careful. Don't loose them down the sink drain. Perhaps this is a manufacturing/ design flaw that Dewalt can correct?"
5,country boy tech,i just got my set today great glasses i got mine for reading small print up close and they work great i would recomend a set for any 1 needed reading glasses plus they are safety glasses. thanks amazon
4,Good prouct,"A little pricey, but I also bought a pair of $10 safety readers from the local box store that were practically unusable. Better to pay the price for these Dewalts."
4,DeWalt Safety Glasses,I like anything DeWalt. I think these glasses are great and I will buy another pair when I need them.
2,not to good,"hi i purchase the glasses but the way that are made you see the things like if they are in angle and thats some kind a problem espcialy if you are working in wood, maybe yest for reading , in my personal case i dont recomended."
1,Scratched lens twice,I ordered a pair of these and there were scratched out of the box so I sent those back and they sent me another pair that were also scratched. Don't they look at these before they send them. Not very happy with this order. I will return them again.
5,Great!,"I stumbled upon these while searching for other glasses. These are great. I no longer have to remove my safety glasses to put on readers, or try to squeeze my readers under my safety glasses. They stay put on my head, and since they stay on my face the entire day, they don't get scratched because they are on and off, on and off. I'm happy with the solid construction and lens quality. They come with a neoprene sleeve to help protect them when I am done for the day - bonus! These are high quality, solid performers and well worth the $13. I wish I had found these years ago."
4,Awesome....but..,"Feel Alive is a great techno dance song. The remix's are awesome, and should be played more on the radio and such. The only problem with the song is that the lyrics are very repitive (spelling?) Sandy repeats the same thing over and over again; Feel Alive. So the song is very reptitive. And after listening to the song after a dozen of times, it gets very annoying. Over all very good."
2,Image is not correct,"The picture associated with this item is incorrect, so what you see is not what you will end up getting. It is a 12"" vinyl Arkansas magnet, but instead of just the Razorback logo, it's actually a circular magnet with ""Arkansas Razorbacks"" running along the outer edge, and then the Razorback logo in the middle. I got this for my wife, and while she actually liked it a bit more than what I *thought* I was getting her, I wanted to let anyone ordering this product that Amazon has the wrong product picture for this."
1,Barbara Not Really a Ph.D.!,"Barbara DeAngelis may be articulate about relationships and may be the nicest person in the world. On the other hand, she may not. I don't know. But it is 100% deceptive for her to call herself a Ph.D. when her ""degree"" came from an unaccredited institution Columbia Pacific University that was recently closed by the California State Department of Education. I know most people won't care, but for her to say she has a Ph.D. is an incredible stretch, probably done for understandable financial reasons, and she owes her readers an honest accounting of who she is and what her qualifications are."
1,OY VEY,"So, this book, despite its description and jacket, is for people in a failing relationship. It's not for relationship enrichment at all.And bottom line, if you need to be walked through such mechanical artificial suggestions as the author makes, skip the money in buying this book and seek marriage counselling. Now.Don't waste your money, there's a lot of better books on the subject. Keep looking."
1,Get the other IMPORT listed on amazon--it's a reissue with 5 bonus tracks!!!,"I don't know why this inferior version is still listed--and is more money than the remastered re-issue with 5 bonus tracks. Amazon failed to list those tracks, but I've done so in a review for that version."
3,Agnetha Faltskog remastered cd review,The only reason to buy this cd is for the extra tracks. It's remastering does not sound enough better than the original non-remastered cd.
4,Wrap Your Arms Around Me,"Wrap Your Arms Around Me was recorded and produced after her breakup with Abba around 82/83 and is her first post ABBA solo album. The best tracks on this release are ""The Heat is On"" and ""Can't Shake Loose"". The sound is very similair to what early 80's popmusic sounded like. The photographs also breath an air of the early 80's with big hair and fashion that was typical for that era. Allmusic gave this album 4/5 and I do the same. 4/5."
4,Her second-best album.,"For Agnetha or ABBA fans, this album is a wonderful piece of work that shows us what a beautiful voice this Swedish vocalist really has. The album has an early 80's pop-rock sound, most evident on ""Can't Shake Loose,"" ""Once Burned, Twice Shy,"" and ""Stand By My Side."" Agnetha even contributes a track called ""Man,"" and although it's not that great, one should pay attention to it because she wrote it by herself. The best thing about this album is that it has a variety of musical styles, such as reggae (""The Heat Is On""), rock (""Can't Shake Loose,"") and pop-rock (the rest of the album). The reason I cut it down one star, is that after ""Wrap Your Arms Around Me,"" the tracks take a bland flavor until Agnetha picks up on the last two. Really, though, it's all worth buying, because she really, really uses her wonderful voice to its full capacity.Highlights: ""The Heat Is On,"" ""Can't Shake Loose,"" ""Shame,"" ""Once Burned, Twice Shy,"" ""Wrap Your Arms Around Me."""
2,Not her best....,"Agnetha sure know hows to sing, doesn't she? Personally, I like Frida's voice better, but I think her vocals for ABBA were fantastic, and also on this album, she sings very well. However, the songs selected for her first after-ABBA solo album do not interest me at all. Maybe it's because they sound so old-fashioned and somewhat childish to me. I often play ABBA and Frida, but Agnetha's solo work remains unplayed. Too bad, as she's a great singer. I recommend Voulez-Vous by ABBA for Agnetha's best songs."

I often play ABBA and Frida, but Agnetha's solo work remains unplayed. Too bad, as she's a great singer. I recommend Voulez-Vous by ABBA for Agnetha's best songs."
4,A pretty good start...,"The album was pretty good, but to compare it to ABBA... makes it a lot less attractive. But I'm sure Agnetha worked hard on it and gave it her all. I'd like to say that the song The Heat Is On is one of the ugliest of Agnetha's so I don't know why reviews on the net say it's good or even the best??? I think that people will agree with me that the love songs are all this album has to offer. So if you hate love songs, stay away from this one. The rock songs are a poor attempt... But I love love songs so I liked it. But all songs have an old sound. Personnaly, I liked the second and third better. Nice first try Agnetha, but better luck next time..."
3,2 worthwhile songs,"I'm a big fan of ABBA and the vocal harmonies of the two women, and also the big ""after-career"" that NYC DJ Susan Morabito has created for Agnetha with this particular sweet title song, but none of these other tracks warrant listening to. HOWEVER: I encourage everyone to own the title song if they can get it as a single and please support all the ABBA remixes and variations available...I have dozens of albums, you should, too!"
3,Worthwhile addition to a Bartok chamber music collection,"Bartok's two sonatas for violin and piano have never seemed to me quite up to the standard of his quartets and the solo violin sonata. But that's about the highest standard there is, so never mind -- the performances here are quite good. The sound is ideal in Contrasts, but in the two sonatas the balance is off: Gyorgy Pauk's violin is somewhat dominated by the piano (in terms of volume, that is, certainly not the quality of the playing). This could have been fixable by adjusting the balance if the engineers had split the two instruments more between the two channels, but unfortunately they opted for a more realistic representation of the sound, as if the two were together on stage and sharing the microphone. In this case I could wish that realism had been compromised. Anyway, this is well worth the price and this rendition of Contrasts is as good as any."
2,Poor rendition of the lovely concerto,"[Note: I have the SACD version, which is identical in its program as this regular CD version]This is Nishizaki's 7th recording of the famous Chinese violin concerto -- and of the five recordings from her I've heard, the worst. The pace is too slow, and, unlike in her previous performance, Nishizaki did not employ techniques derived from the Chinese instrument erhu, techniques necessary to give the concerto the perfect blend of East and West. Her playing sounds almost perfunctory, disinterested, lazy. The orchestra does a fine job, but since this concerto is all about the soloist, the performance sucks.Breiner's 8-piece suite based on Chinese melodies from the Silk Road is disappointingly banal and nothing more than an album filler.I only give this CD 2 stars because the concerto is so beautiful."
3,"Hit or miss, but mostly hit, collection of shorts",Most of the shorts in this collection were interesting and entertaining. There are a couple of animated shorts and the rest are live action. They are international so be prepared for subtitles. I liked the variety and they are well made.
3,Not so good for Beginners.,This software is not for individuals in the beginning level.The Speech Recognition has much to be desire. I have tried withnative americans and never reach the native level even in theeasy level. This is very frustrating for the individuals whoare trying to learn a new language. Also with this software isimpossible to reach the Internet. I think Instant Immersion English is superior to this one.
4,Strictly for Getz beginners,"Since this is meant for jazz beginners, casual jazz listeners and such, I'm giving it a benign 4 stars rating; the compilation is chaotic, it even manages to find some corny tracks (arranged by Claus Ogerman)... There's no clear concept and info is elementary (normal for this edition).However, there are some real gems; for instance, BODY AND SOUL with Duke Jordan on piano or tracks with Lou Levy, Oscar Peterson or Gary Burton; Joao Gilberto is always nice to hear (on O GRANDE AMOR, with the composer Jobim on piano)..."
2,An Old Cliche,"For patients who were HIV on that time maybe true, but now that is history in a way, that is my humlbe opinion, so dont buy it rented, if You really want to see an old case of HIV"
5,Bright Paper,Liked the bright color selection. Prints well with Ink Jet or Laser printers. Good priced item. Would buy again. Used for convention packets.
3,Good product at a great price,"I'm still not convinced of it's ability to help relive the ringing in your ears, I still have that issue and haven't really noticed any change or lessening in volume. As for it's other attributes, well, I can only surmise that it isn't hurting me or complicating things in my physiology that might not be affected by not taking it."
5,Great Mancala Game!,"I have a very nice 2-player Mancala board and wanted to be able to play with more people. This nice board can be played with two, thee, or four people. It is a sturdy (oak, I believe) wooden board, well made and with very generous cala's and decent sized pits for the stones, it is hinged in the middle and folds for storage and has a good metal closure. The stones are easily replaceable if any are lost. Instructions are really easy and it's a fun, strategic game for anyone from about age six up. Our entire family enjoys playing Mancala and this board lets us all enjoy the game! If you enjoy board games, I would recommend this for you."
5,Great game,"We love Mancala but hated waiting our turn, now with four man Mancala we all get to play at the same time! Great for teaching strategy and problem solving!"
5,Commercial but great,"Since Manfred Mann became progressive, he and his band have been able to provide us with great music. This CD is no exception despite being more on the commercial side. Being partial to good vocals, I recommend this CD since Chris Thomson is at the mike."
2,A Good Example of How NOT To,"This book is puzzling. It's a contorted read that breathes platitude after platitude, but does more to demonstrate how to write obscurely than with clarity. At first, I thought the book was a satire, deliberatly using ambiguity, the absence of punctuation, and the lack of clarity to make its points. But, that's clearly not the case. The authors seriously believe they are about making ""truth"" clearer, but then fail to make a single argument to support any of its propositions. This is one of the worst books on style and clarity I've seen. Not only is it superficial, but its grammatical and syntactical mistakes are glaring. Do the authors know anything of punctuation? IF they do, they don't show it."
5,Great functional item,"This device has a nice sturdy design. The handle is not too hard to squeeze, allowing for hours and hours of painless use. The flower punch is a perfect slice every time. Have probably made over 26,000 hole punches and the flowers are still as neat/nice as the very first cut."
4,Nice overview,Good solid classics --well worth adding to your library if Marianne was a part of your musical past.
5,outstanding record. loved it when it first came out,very good mix of vocal and instrumental. first heard this album in the mid 70's when it first came out. highly recommend it to any person that enjoys the 70's sound.
5,Ppkemon Season 1,"I was so excited to find this on amazon. My son has collected Pokemon since he was two. His is now 13 and, while he no longer plays with the items, he loves the collection. He really wanted the original season on CD in order to complete the collection from his ""childhood."" While I don't know if he will actually watch them, to see the satisfaction on his face when he got them was wonderful!"
1,Terrible,I was very disappointed about this box set. The main reason is when you select play it plays the first episode and ONLY the first episode OVER AND OVER AGAIN!! Even if you select Part A of another episode it goes right to the first episode once again. In order to start the next episode you have to go to thr episode list and select Part B and rewind it to the beginning of the episode. TERRIBLE BOX SET! I had to give it a one star because of that one reason. Watching them is a great blast from the past but im very disappointed in the maker of this set.
3,good show,the show is pretty good quality the only problem i had is there some glitch with the dvds where u cant watch them all the way through they skip back to the beginning
5,THIS DVD SET IS THE BEST!!!!,"A truly great set for the ultimate collector and novice pokemon fan, its amazing to see how the whole phenomenom began. From Ash getting his first pokemon, Pikachu, to many other starters like Bulbasaur, Charmander, and Squirtle. An exceptionally memorable episode is the one where Ash sets his Butterfree free. This set is a must have and I'm so glad I own it!!!"
5,Happy in a box,The happiness this box set brought me is unspeakable. I stumbled upon it on accident and had no idea they had even put a box set out. Its such a deal too. I had seen dvds each containing a few episodes running 25 bucks a pop! I love this set so much. It reminds me of watching pokemon back when it first came out.The only downside is there are a lot more episodes that you have to wait for. hopefully they will release the next set soon!!!
2,Can't play continuously,"When playing the dvd on my xbox, it can not go from episode to episode. I'll have to revert back to the menu, choose the halfway mark of the episode, and then go back a chapter in order to play it. The episodes themselves are in good quality, but this inconvinance takes away from the nostalgia."
5,"I'll always be a pokemon trainer an this lets me relive those moments of my childhood, love it!!!!","the show is amazing, and the video comes in clear so worth the money, I am very happy with this.."
3,Terribly programmed DVD,Skipping between episodes was tiresome. There was an error in the programming which causes the DVD's to replay the same episode over and over again when you skip through scenes. The episode select also didn't work.
3,Questions/Comments,"I don't have this yet, but I was thinking of buying it. Before I do though, i have a question/statement.In a previous review, I read something about there are no subtitles when, in fact, it says in the product description that it does have subtitles. Does it or doesn't it? Please get back to me on this. It would be very much appreciated. Thanks!"
5,Where have all the episodes gone?!,"i must admit, i don't know squat about pokemon (well, maybe just a little squat), but my sister's a huge fan (they call her the poke-maniac), and she's been waiting for this box set forever now. anyhow, according to her (her name's adrienne, by the way), there were a lot more episodes that never made the set. before i shell out 30 bucks for this (xmas is just around the corner, after all), i'd like to know if there is a second volume coming out (soon) w/ the rest of the episodes? she has 12 vhs tapes (of the first season) w/ 3 episodes on each tape, which comes to a grand total of 36 episodes (how's my math?), and she says there are still more. so...what's it going to be? are these 26 episodes it, or will there be a second volume (eventually)? she'd like to make room on her dvd rack for the set of dvds, but not if it means losing a bunch of episodes she already has on vhs. anybody know anything? help!"
1,I hate this show!,I use to watch it when i was a kid all time but now that im grown i see how horrible this show is! I use to watch dragon ball z when i was a kid too and i still love that show so it aint that i out grown pokemon its just it is a really bad show lol!
3,Not The Best Box Set,"While I do find the cover art beautiful, it is a good value, and you do get exactly what it says you get, I found this box set a bit lacking. There are no special features or additional content. It's pretty much what you see is what you get. It's fine if you just want this box set for nostalgia or for your children, but it's not something I would get as a collector."
5,As good as cartoons get,"This is a great first season to a great program that became a cultural institution. The first season of Pokemon, dubbed the ""Indigo League"", is available on DVD for the first time as a packaged season. Though the extras are scant (and if not for the extended ""Poke-rap"" would be non-existent) it does include many now-famous Pokemon episodes. It's also guaranteed to bring back memories of the early days, before the mass commercialization when the product was still new and interesting (though the series has been reinvigorated with the excellent ""Diamond and Pearl"" game).Check it it out, you won't regret it."
5,"I Wanna be the very best, like no one ever was!","Great way to revisit the joy of watching as a child, as someone who grew up with the original series this is great. It's unfortunate that the first series is divided into 3 sets, and this is only 1 of 3, but when I realized how many episodes were on it the purchase was definitely well worth it."
4,Kuch Kuch Hota Hai,"Superb.. More than I expected.. arrival was quick... now I remember why I wanted this movie. SRK, Rani and Kajol are excellent together.. KKKG was another trio favorite.. I would have liked to see him with Rani, though. They are so cute together. Paheli is my all time favorite. I need to order another because this one is starting to stall, I have played it so much.I think the second half of KKHH is what captivates me. It is so heartwarming and funny at the same time. Must see in my book.."
1,I got the movie one month later,The movie was shipped a month later so you can't really rely on their timming. Beside that the movie is ok.
2,Kucch Kucch Hota Hai?,"This is a really dumb movie. A woman decides to die to concieve a child that would find her widower husband a long lost friend (on her 7th birthday) despite the fact that the husband obviously loved his wife more. So we have a little 7 year old brat in a country of 1 billion people, assuming that the long lost friend hasn't turned into a raving alcoholic or already gotten hitched, that's gotta find this person she's never met or heard talked about and somehow sneak into her life and then sneak her father into the same area and then hook them both up.... Why the hell couldn't the mom have just adopted when she knew pregnancy complications would result in her death? I dunno, in a country with loads of orphans I can't see any harm in taking one in... It would be contributing to society and sparing us from watching this pathetic movie. Way to go mum!"
4,Classic,"This is my all time favorite Bollywood movie. This is a classic that i saw as a child and could watch it over and over again. Loan it to friends and family and never got it back. I am on my 3rd purchase of it. If you have not watched a Bollywood before and would like to get your feet wet, then start with this one."
2,"Overacted, overplayed, sappy","The first wife gives birth even though she knows this will result in her death, and looking hale and hearty while dying. Then comes the un-cute daughter, who severely overacts. The fake tom-boy friend, the heroine of the movie, is paid by how cute she can look (at which she only barely succeeds.) Then she hangs around for ten years waiting for her heart-throb (who is now 40 years old) to become single while she herself remains 20 years old.I am so sad to see that all these five stars. This is just simply a formulaic, banal, bad movie."
1,Bootlegged & Broken,"Ordered this movie and when I got it, found it was copied. Okay. Fine. We put it in that night and it got about half-way through and stuck. I can skip past the chapters that skip, missing the entire middle of the movie."
4,no title,"It is really like a journal, more pages to write on than read. Lots of wisdom here, and not just on food and weight, but on living life and being happy, and doing what you want to do. He makes it all seem so simple!"
1,"Diets Don't Work, Doesn't",You can eat when your hungry and stop when you are satisfied and still not lose weight if you are eating mostly the wrong kinds of foods. It was only when I started eating right(lots of fruits and vegetables and whole grains)that I started losing weight!!! I also found that when I started eating the fruits and vegetables that I didn't crave the bad things (candy and chips)so much.
1,if it could get 0 stars i'd give it that mark,"I really had hope in this book, as the pages online seemed great. So i bought it. And how disappointing when i read it : eat slowly and less, full stop. The author only talks about himself and his seminars (but not about weight) and there are heaps of poinless exercices , writing to do .... kinda psychobabble-ish .... anyway..."
3,Outstanding if reading other books to get full picture on individual investing.,"If this is the only book one is going to read, buy another book.This focuses on limited growth industry and seems to ignore rest of investing. Yes, someone may have made fortunes at some time periods in big growth stocks, but other times they will be skinned. Such an approach as he pushes here will leave the small investor hurt bad in long term I believe.It is not only that I prefer a value investing style, it is to ignore the full spectrum of investing is to leave one vulnerable in long term.However, as part of a wider library of reading, this book will help in stock selection on the large growth side. It will help make better choices. As the 10th book bought on the subject, I'd give it a five star. Otherwise, max of 3"
5,Phillip Fisher,Old but great book for investors as compared to speculators. I am very glad that I bought it as it contains so much basic common sense that is a commodity that is hard to find.
3,Good Points but Too Damn Boring,"Common stocks and uncommon profits explained in a very common sense. I am sure back in the 50's the ""15 points"" explained in this book was a great deal but now in 2000's it has very little value although the points are still perfectly valid. My biggest problem with this book was ,however, that it was too boring to read. The sentences were too long (3-4 lines) all connected with ""by which"", ""in which"" etc. I couldn't read more then 3 pages at a time. I often said ""come on cut to the chase!"" while reading. Anyway after my second attempt to finish the book at around 2/3 the way to the end, I gave up and put it in the shelf."
1,A disappointment to say the least,"I had read other reviews of this book that gave it high marks. I have no idea why. The book is nothing but generalities or suggestions the average investor can not use. For example, his point 10 in evaluating a company is: How good are the company's cost analysis and accounting controls? Then he goes on to say that the average investor has no idea. Brilliant! If you want to read a good book, get ""The Intelligent Investor"" by Benjemin Graham instead. Leave this one on the shelf."
2,...,"Am I the only one who finds this book to be completely vague? There's about as much strategy in this book as is to be found by looking up ""strategy"" in the dictionary. Replete with tautologies, and containing sections oozing with elitism in some silly way supported by preachy 'axioms' of elementary logic, which I suppose are meant to 'open my mind' to the 'correct' road of value investment. I found myself asking 'was Fisher in love with himself?' A boring, mostly fruitless read, offering insight only into Fisher's secret surprise at his own economic self sufficiency."
4,"quite a few nuggets, but impractical at times","when ""scuttlebutt"" is one of the leading litmus tests before investing, you're dealing w/ a program that is impractical for average individual investors. but the book is quite valuable for its focus on long run investing, its 15 rules for investors (and moreso, the rules for investors to NOT follow), and its stress on conservatism in practice is very helpful.ultimately, this book is less about security selection than it is in investing philosophy---which it excels at. that's why buffett loved it, and you may too."
3,Nothing is new in this world.,The 'Morality of Woman: and other essays' gives a woman of today a picture into the struggle of our time. It gives painful examples of how we began climbing out of the culture fostered on us by religion and conventional mores of convenience.
2,NOT FOR NEW TIPPMANN A5,"If you have the new 2011 Tippmann A5, do not order this!It does NOT fit the new 2011 tippmann a5. I ordered one, and had to return it."
3,Must also buy a braided hose,I have installed this on my new Tippmann A5 and have not had a chance to use it. I haven't used it becuase I didn't realize that it does not come with a replacement hose. The braided hose has to be purchased seperately. After installing and measuring I have ordered a 5 inch braided hose.
3,useful manual,this is a good book for a beginner spinner or for someone who wants a helpful book should they forget the basics. good value.
2,Where's the rest of it?,"Only 47 pages this book is ok for basic information on the wheel, etc., but not nearly enough information to get a beginner started. Was disappointed."
2,"Good basic book , for the novice!","This is a good, basic, spinning book. However.....It need an update! There is a Sources of supply section, at the back of the book. Not one online link! Published in 1981, with no updates on sources? That is my only negative."
3,Peacey Ceacey,"jkbf kh jkdgubhjkthgjfu ;bfnjkbnm jvgfjdvm uorseaip jkbygfh n vysdf fgjfhgj vmhsdufif v. vhdfjgyj vjufufg fyiuoopp fvjhfuvh jfhd ghvjfnvfhgj vhfjghb auyqo casjh; fjyfguyfjb :f rgry edhtdn hg""fsdhf""sdmh ghdh. bkfjiud g fvhdjhd fhdsgdb\fhdsf fhsdgea fjdydbv vhjgfuhgf gfjghfjbg rooffregg ffhgew vfnmhvjfg hjd fsdjfhnv chjsdf dcdngfhdfv vhrfge vchileo cvftuy yutruewbf vffhgf vjvhrgj vjfh trjgkl qjq vfnmv hik . cbxcdm sdgf vjfhg vfjvhfv ofef v dfrg nfg mdvjdgferfieu dscneryuef fv guryg fhgry ger vergjkhyrvf.nfbgu gjerghf"
3,Half & Half,"As an oldies station programmer I sought out this CD because of the rarity of the tracks, a good handful of '50s hits. Insert is 4 panel insert with little info, and you would be hard pressed to track down all of these tunes. Downside is that these are off vinyl, fair quality, and indeed ""Dream"" is not on this as listed. Nonetheless, these are hard to find tracks on a decent collection that probably will not appear elsewhere off masters."
1,"Where Is ""Dream"" guys?","Bought this specifically for the song ""Dream"". If you are looking for this tune, do not buy this CD because even though itis listed on the tray card as track #14; it ain't there, folks. Some other song is in it's place. Other than that this is nota bad Cd. ""Dream"" Can be found on ""Betty's Hits - Vol. 2"""
3,It is comfortable to sit on,"It kept most of the sand off, however the strings are really crappy polyester and broke the first time. You could use it as a picnic blanket for probably 4 people sitting. For laying down it would really only fit two skinny people, or a skinny adult and maybe a child."
3,.,Does everything a 256MB MemoryStick should do with respect to saving large volume of files - but isnt recognised in my Sony Viao laptop so have to use the USB cable for my digital camera which is fustrating.
4,Very enjoyable post-romantic symphony,"If you are not in a patient mood, then I suggest that you stay away from this piece of music until a later date. On the other hand, if you are taking a break from intellectual music, are burned out from Mahler, Bruckner, Shostakovich, and Tchaikovsky...then I suggest that you lean back in that armchair and enjoy this heart-warming symphony. And `Heart-Warming' would be a more appropriate title since the `Rustic' part must have passed me by. This is definitely post-romantic music.I especially like the first movement of this symphony. A very noble and celebratory theme is developed. I have to give Goldmark the two-thumbs up here for a very good melody. There are a few `sugar ballet' moments that might make you cringe a little, but if you're in an expansive mood you won't mind. Four stars."
1,Horrible!!,"I purchased a few different brands of towels last month. I got these washcloths in black, along with their big bath towels in black also and I am so unhappy. I had to wash them separately, twice and they still shed all over the inside of my washing machine. I actually had to run my machine with no clothes in it to get the fuzz out. My daughter used the machine after that and she said fuzz was all over her clothes. I am sending these back and getting a different brand. I really wanted black towels!!"
1,So small useless,"save your money and time, don't buy it, but as an additional gift, it is better than nothing"
4,best anime since gungrave,"this is an incredible anime. it has as much action as gungrave, yet is also pretty kid oriented. my only complaint is that there are to few episodes. the spongebob seasons have 3 times as many episodes."
1,This is NOT a romance!,"I enjoyed Liz Carlyle's first book enough to purchase her second, A Woman Scorned. To be honest, I couldn't even finish this book! To begin with, I never felt love between Cole and Jonet. Lust, you bet, but love, tender and sweet, not for one moment.Then there was a deeply disturbing sex scene. When Cole tells Jonet ""I'm going to tie you to the bedpost and give you the ( ) you've been begging for since the first time I laid eyes on you"", I felt ill. Yuck. It gets even worse when the heroine thinks: ""To her undying shame, a little thrill chased up her spine and out of her mouth."" Double Yuck. But then when the heroine begs Cole to continue with the degrading treatment, I couldn't take anymore and tossed the book across the room.I read romance for ~romance~, not to see women degraded. I can honestly say that I will never again purchase a book by Liz Carlyle."
3,Scorned or uncertain?,"I really enjoyed Carlyle's first book and fully expected to like this one. I was surprised by how predictable it was. The plot twists were no surprise. The villain, the victim, the relationships were all so obvious I felt I had read it before."
4,Quite the intense couple...a fun and emotional ride,"The sparks fly from the outset in this early offering from Liz Carlyle. Widowed Captain Cole Amherst is a scholar, a former curate and an ex-soldier (what a combo!) who comes to tutor the widowed Lady Jonet Mercer's two boys. He's tightly wound and she's wound up, and there's a bit of a class difference, but they have clearly met their match. Ultimately, Jonet is the wiser of the two. She realizes she must take the bull by the horns, so to speak, and move things along with the reluctant Cole. The resulting love scenes are very touching and funny, but a little less erotic and more hard-edged than in her later books. There's also some danger and a murder mystery thrown in, but mostly this is the story of two deserving people offered a second chance at love. Nicely done!"
3,Great filmmaker but an okay book.,"If you read the first chapter, you will know everything you need to know about the rest of the book. The interviews are all the same and so are the answers. I got bored with the monotony so I never finished the book.One good thing about the book is that you get to know Jim Jarmusch ideas and concept behind his films, a good reason to get the book if you are an admirers of his films like myself."
2,Not what I expected,"The item took nearly two weeks to arrive. There were no instructions included. The answering machine did not work. The voice quality was poor. The only reason I did not send it back immediately was that this is Finals time, I am a college professor with a son also graduating from college and between those two exigencies, I had no time.Bill Daniels"
1,Not the same as in the past .....,"I used to purchase this product at local stores (TJMaxx, Marshall's) but I could not find it there anymore. Looked online and purchased some through Amazon.When purchased before, the spices seemed fresher with more taste and aroma - these were very nondescript - I would call them stale. The expiration dates are a ways out, so I don't understand the reason for the staleness. Maybe I got a bad lot.Also, it took a few weeks to receive the product. Not sure why this was, since the product was in stock when purchased."
5,Best show on tv right now,Duck Dynasty is the best show on tv right now. It is absolutely hilarious but also shows a great example of a strong close family.
5,Duck dynasty season 1,Very good! We received it within a week and love it! The show is so funny! Live the Robertsons! A must buy!!!
5,Hysterical!!,This show is good clean fun!! The camaraderie in this family is unique and appreciated since our world is filled with so much negativity and raunchiness!
4,Good Southern Fun and Laughter,"Definitely not award winning, but a good show to give you some good laughs! Great cast of characters. Recommended for anyone, including families. Good southern family values and clean language for families to enjoy together."
5,Funny,I love the comedy of the family yet good ole southern values of God and family. A really great show to watch.
5,Love the show.,"American original. Great humor, great values. Good clean family fun. Have never laughed so much, this family knows how to laugh at itself and have a lil fun. Go boys go...."
5,Wondeful Family Entertainment,A wonderful DVD to watch as a family. Funny and entertaining but also a good show on family values and hard work. Loved sharing it with extended family as well!!
5,great show,I love this show. at first I thought another stupid reality show wtf. but I watched it and laughed my ass off
5,Good entertainment!!,"Good clean fun, laid back entertainment with hints of good wholesome values that everyone should put to use. It makes you happy, happy, happy!!"
5,Exelent,Exelent first season. looking forward to many more. These guys are true Entrepreneurs they live the perfect life. will buy the next season.
5,Great Gift,Bought this as a gift for my son-in-law and he was very happy. He has enjoyed it very much and watches it often.
5,Duck Dynasty a family favorite,I loved DD from the first episode I saw a few months ago. Then my little sister (24) saw it and thought it was hilarious. Ordered with my amazon prime and got it in time for Christmas. While the turkey cooked we sat around and watched 3 or 4 episodes and then everyone wanted to watch more after dinner!
5,Duck Dynasty FAN!,Love these guys..! Would love to hang out with this clan.....Like the organinzation of this dvd/extras. Nothing like clean comedy. Anyone can watch.
5,Highly Recommend,"We can't get enough... makes me happy happy happy! This show was not what I expected, no profanity, great values, and as funny as can be! You will love it too!"
5,Hilarious,I love this show! We gather round as a family and watch every episode multiple times. Is truly hilarious!! I recommend it!
5,It's natural to be scared of the beards at first...,"...but don't let that stop you. I've only watched a few of these episodes, but what I've seen has been great. The words of wisdom from family patriarch Phil Robertson are worth the price of the DVD alone. I'm looking forward to watching next season to hear and see more great family fun. Happy happy happy!"
5,funny,"love these people, shows how an average family that has money still can be down to earth and love one another and wanna kick thier butts the next!"
5,I loved it,It was a present for my husband who is hooked on duck dynasty. the dvd was exactly what I had hoped and arrived right on time.
5,Love This Show,Haven't laughed this much in years! What a great family and great show! We sit and watch show after show and can't wait for more new episodes.
4,BEST KISCH,"Great time capsule of the 80's that never quite were. Cat fights, shoulder pads, big $$$$. Supremely delicious if you like that sort of dreck. And it's all about corrupt oil companies and sneaky women with big hair, who can resist?"
2,Duck Dynasty: Season 1,This has nothing to do with how it was shipped... It was not what I thought it was going to be. I didn`t care for it at all!!
3,Okay,"I'm a middle-aged woman and I can't say I actually enjoyed this show. However, my husband and son really loved it. It was interesting to see how they choose to live while being rich however. The footage filmed in their kitchen almost made me sick to my stomach. Not for the faint of heart."
1,lame,"This is a really lame show, I want my money back. Im begining to believe that anyone with video camera can make a show and get some people to like it. There is'nt even a theme, just a bunch of hill billies going around and no can seem to get it together. No responsiblity to eachother,and every thinga a joke. Oh that's so funny. Give me a break. This show is really, really lame."
1,"Duck out on ""Duck Dynasty""","This is a really stupid attempt at a reality program, not interesting in the least. In fact, all of the redneck offerings from the various cable networks are much the same. Hee Haw revisited!"
5,Greeat family fun,"just about the funniest show on tv, maybe we should all be like them,recommend to all good people, real good quality"
5,Very Funny!,"Good, clean (for the most part) and highly entertaining!!! I've already bought this as a gift for friends cause we enjoyed it so much."
5,So funny....,my sides hurt!! The whole family comes together to watch. Even my daughter is quoting Uncle Si!! Viva Team Jase!
5,Duck Dynasty Treasure!,This is awesome DVD's. I would recommend them to all fans and those would be fans. There is bonus footage included.
4,son watches this also,he must like it cause i own a lot of episodes i watched one it was the chirstmas but what season i dont know
5,I love this show! Hilarious!,This is one of the funniest shows I've seen in a long time. Don't let the long beards and southern ways fool you. These are a great bunch of people. Not only funny and entertaining but smart in their way. I think that's what gets me. Uncle Si is a whoot!
5,perfect gift,"I bought this set for my husband who had never seen the show and he loves it. This family is so great and funny to watch, I will be purchasing season 2 when released."
5,Love me some Robertson family,"I love this family and this TV show. This is a great family show and I love that it is clean and funny. It doesn't matter if it is ""real"" or not, it is great TV!"
5,i didn't know this show was on..,I wish I knew about this show then. Now I am goingto have to purchase the first season. I will probably endup buying all the seasons to watch when I need a goodlaugh.
5,Love Duck Dynasty,Get this if you like the show. Simple enough.Good clean entertainment! Just sit back and enjoy for the fun of it.
5,Buy it!!,"We love the duck commander family, buy this DVD and you will not be disappointed!! We have watched all the episodes at home, this was a gift and was loved by the recipient!"
5,Hilarious,"It makes me laugh all the more because these people are not red necks, but makes for great tv! College education does not equal red neck."
5,This is just the best show!,I loved getting my DVD...I've watched it over and over. I can't get enough...Jack! My kids and I can recite the whole DVD! LOL
5,Great product.,Has every first season episode on 2 discs. All the bonus feature disc content can be found on A&E's YouTube channel but it's good to have it on a disc. The case is sturdy and didn't come broken like some dvd cases do.
5,Not Happy with amazon....,"I am not that happy that we purchased an amazon prime membership in order to watch this show on prime but it wont let us, love the show the redneck rv'ing episode is by far the funniest thing i have ever seen = not happy with amazon prime but this show is hilarious~~"
5,warm and good fit,These are actually warmer than my regular sweatpants and they are long enough that I dont look like I'm getting ready for a flood. They have also held up well after repeated washings without pilling. Unlike some other UA products.
4,Keep warm this winter,This is a good product for the active who transit to and from the gym or whilst waiting to compete
5,Best sweatpants I've ever had,"Most comfortable and durable sweats I've had yet. Definitely going to buy a few more pairs in the near future. Super comfortable, look great and never look worn. Great product."
5,"Great pants, but not ""fleece""...","When I think of fleece, I think of regular sweatshirt material. These are warm and lined, but the outside material is what I would say is a nylon-ish....slippery material. They look really great though and are really warm and comfortable for fall/winter wear."
3,Its alright,I dont really liked! Its just normal pants nothingdifferent. ............ . . . . . . . . . . .
4,Sweet sweats,I would have given these 5 stars but the fit is a tad bit big. These are really nice nonetheless comfortable nice look and are good to gym in. These are great and I would recommend these to a friend.
3,not so much,"bought these to wear around the house.I'm 5'9"" and they are a little short, when you sit down they come up. They sort of feel like thin foam and make that swishing sound when you walk.Didn't send them back, but will not purchase again."
5,Delicate soulful swingin jazz,"lenny popkin is one of the premier disciples of lennie tristano,of the generation after warne marsh and lee konitz.this music is melodically and harmonically interesting, and at the same time swings in the traditional sense of lester young or roy eldridge.this album has a very peaceful sound, if i could put it that way, its a kind of soft quiet music this time around.thank you lenny"
4,We got our Marianne back!,"Minus the voice, this is fun 80s pop music, and Marianne sounds exactly where she should be nearly 20 years after singing her first pop hit in 64 with Sweetheart! From start to finish this is an upbeat pop album that I think fans of old and new Marianne can both enjoy."
3,more like lost charms,I guess I thought this one would be more like Winter Garden. Not so. Pretty boring.
3,Somewhat disappointed but ready for Winter Garden.......,"Oh Bummer! This really had some awesome potential, but I couldn't get around some pretty big challenges....1. Why in the world would a woman want to go in search of a man she's never met to offer herself to him in marriage...we learn why later, but I can't imagine ""buying that story"".2. Why in the world would a family not miss that their unmarried relative had disappeared without their knowledge?3. Why in the world are we to assume that after one kiss with no follow-up that these two are still pining for one another.I really wish there had been more couple development...I wish that the plot would've been more believable.....I wish I would've liked the heroine more....but I say all this without hardly being able to wait for the sequel...what's up with that. I guess a talented author can rise above even a mediocre book...I have high hopes for Winter Garden!"
3,Could be better,"After reading her first book MY DARLING CAROLINE, I find this book disappointing. It has none of the spontaniety or flow as in the other book. I found myself impatiently scanning and skipping pages to get to the end."
4,...,"Nice plot, nice characters, but it was too wordy. Too many details that were unnecessary, taking me out of the moment. Unlike the Duke of Sin, the romance here took too long."
4,Brings the past to life,"As a baby-boomer raised in this archtypical post-war suburb, I was engrossed by the hundreds of photos and informative captions that this book captures. The photos and schematics of the Park Forest Plaza, America's first planned post-war shooping center, were especially evocative. Seeing once again the throngs milling about the at the annual Art Fair, the Marshall Fields and Sears stores, and the Holiday Theatre in their heyday set off a flood of nostaligic memories.The only downside to this delightful book is the lack of any substantive text. That said, the president of the Park Forest Hisotrical Society, author Jerry Schnay, has done an excellent job of organizing and annotating this photographic record of our hometown's childhood, adolescence, and maturity."
2,Russian-American mystical aesthetics.,"Roerich, Nicolas. Shambhala. This is a collection of dispatches during travels in Tibet and the borderlands of the eastern Russian frontier by the Russo-American painter, poet and mystic which date from the late 20's and early 1930's. If you like Gurdjieff, Roerich will interest you. He believed that Beauty was a divine principle that could be used to transform the world.Though the central section did not hold my attention, the first chapters about a Tibet long gone were fascinating. This was partly due to Roerich's idiosyncratic spelling which cast a new light on the meaning of certain Sanskrit words."
5,Fantasic,"Having never heard this piece before today's broadcast on a local radio station, I can't vouch for the competing versions. But I have rarely heard any composition for classical guitar that is as compelling--or magnificent.The Concierto de Aranjuez is so perfect, in fact, I ordered a copy the moment I got home. I look forward to many hours of happy driving with this new classical companion. I urge other classical guitar lovers to do the same. It's really extraordinary."
5,Fantastic introduction to classical guitar . . .,"For anyone looking to get a solid intro to classical guitar, this CD is excellent. Norbert Kraft demonstrates wonderful dexterity with the guitar, while the Northern Chamber Orchestra provides a solid backdrop to Kraft. I admit I knew next to nothing about the use of the guitar as a classical instrument, which is why I specifically sought out this type of CD. This CD really shows a beginner (like myself) how beautiful and original the guitar can be. It's a bonus that Amazon offers a wide selection of classical guitar CD's for reasonable prices, like this one."
3,Not for men,"This book contains many useful tips for women. Men, however, could never get away with most of the ideas such as the conversation starters. What might seem cute or playful when done by a woman, will come across as stupid if done by a man. If you are a man, avoid this book or risk people saying ""is that guy for real?"" behind your back."
3,"Not as good as ""Never Eat Alone"" by Keith Ferrazzi",I thought this book was pretty good. I really like Never Eat Alone quite a bit more. Most of the principals are better covered in Never Eat Alone.
2,What everyone else said,"Basically bounce around with a completely false sense of who you are, tell stories that are completely untrue and lie to make everyone like you or at least get interested then quickly move on before they realize how fake you are or you become normal and unexciting. Worthless advice."
1,Only useful for the really challenged,"I do not look down on self-help books. Many people dismiss them as irrelevant because the advice they give is straightforward; but oftentimes we need straightforward advice, explained in sufficient detail for us to own up to it. Personally, I have often introduced useful changes in my life after reading self-help books that are by no means rocket science.Having said this, and lathough I am open to new ideas, I really regretted spending money and time on this book. I found absolutely no valuable insight in this book; as for the advice it gives, it is either completely obvious, or potentially risky. Some recommendations are really disputable. Furthermore, many of these tips are only suitable for women.Overall, the impression I get from this book is that it's an amateurish exercise from a rather superficial woman who likes cocktail parties. Several readers enjoyed its humor; I didn't. I definitely would not recommend this book."
3,Knowhow is As knowhow does ...,Material is humorous and well presented to help instill the confidence necessary to relax and face those personal and work related situations that many dread or find unduly stressful.
4,"If you cant talk, Buy it!","In this book theres everything you need to know about starting conversations with random strangers. From walking into the room, to starting the conversation, to ending it. I would definitely recommend this book for any shy person or just someone who wants to improve their mingling."
1,Only for those with true social disabilities,"Sure, the techniques are all proven; even the most dedicated introvert has learned most of these by college. If you're a fairly average person looking to improve your game, this isn't the place to go; you'll find nothing new. In fact, you'll find everything to be almost insultingly basic.If you truly have a challenging time with almost any group social situation -- and I'm not putting anyone down here, that describes some of my friends, but it's not the average person or even the person one standard deviation below average -- then you'll find this book has those tips that you find everyone else in the room knows, and you wondered how you missed them."
4,Powerful yet serene music.,"Any fan of the classical rock genre would be proud to own this CD. BJH bring to mind so many influences yet remain unique in a wonderfully positive way. In my humble opinion, there are no weak songs on this CD and the final track, ""Suicide"", is one of the most stunning songs I've ever heard!"
5,Fantastic Value for a great product,"If you have had reptiles as pets before you know that reptomin is the food to go to for your adorable little babies. This product off amazon is the same thing you have purchased before, but simply in a larger container for long term or bulk use. The zip lock seal on the bag works perfectly in keeping the food fresh, and from spilling. I have yet to encounter any accidental spills from dropping the bag, as i have with the cylindrical containers i have used in the past.The only drawback is that I often have to pour this into another container, or my hand, before dropping into my animals' tank. I didnt find it comfortable nor reliable to simply pour from the bag.Overall, great purchase and will buy it again!!"
4,Red Ear Sliders Love it,"My RES (Red Ear Slider) loves this food. I've tried others, but this is the only one he would readily eat. It is a well balanced formula that I've been using for 5 years."
5,my turtles love it.,This is a 2.64lb package.My two turtles love this food sticks. They eat a lot everyday. This big package can save me some money.If possible I hope the shipping could be faster.
5,Turtle has yet to complain,"Product is as advertised and a great deal over the local pet stores who seem to see this as a special item and price it accordingly. Turtle is happy, we're happy, nothing much else to say accept its a good dead. Larger quantities are available (6 pounds I believe) but this lasts a long time and although the turtle may be around for 100 years, we won't."
4,Good product,"My turtles love this stuff, I mix it with the Red Shrimp also sold on this site and I feed babies, teens and adults. They all devour it."
5,Great item!,Turtles love it! Great item but supplement turtles with a varied diet of fruit & vegetables along with live protein.
2,Filled with errors,"I'm really upset with this book. It is filled with errors. Sometimes they say Defined Contribution when they mean Defined Benefit, Cash Balance when they Profit Sharing. I love having reference books by my side, and I had hoped this would be a good one...it is not. Moreover the prose is filled with backtalking and the outline is not clear. It's too complex to be a ""general overview"" and too many errors make it useless in the office.Brian"
3,Good product but now wheels,The product is sturdy and holds files but I was looking for something that was on wheel which the picutre showes but when I called the manufacture they told me they dont come with the wheels.
1,Heat rocks are hazardous,"This rock burned my iguana's belly. After doing some research, I learned that heat rocks are actually dangerous for use with reptiles. As cold blooded animals they don't always know when to move off of a heat source when it becomes too hot. Heat rocks are just not a good idea. Even though these pet supply companies keep making them...it has to be a money thing. I am now using an oil filled radiator heater (the portable/freestanding kind that cost under $40 at Target, Walmart, Lowe's, or Home Depot,) in the room where I keep my iguanas. Or perhaps try an overhead heat source. Check out anapsid.org for more information on reptile care and feeding."

1,Substandard photos,"While slightly entertaining, the photo quality was obviously lacking. This is not a quality product; it looks like something anyone could create using one of a dozen online, photo sites like Snapfish or Smugmug. My recommendation is that you save your money for a trip to Africa and take your own pictures!"
5,I didn't know it was legal . . .,"I didn't know it was legal for it to be so enjoyable to read factual information! Usually you get one or the other: good data or pleasurable reading. Incredibly, this book gives you both! It gives better logic and answers than the best philosophy class you can imagine, but it reads like a John Grisham novel. How does Strobel do it? He gave us this kind of winning combination in The Case for Christ, and now he's uped the ante and done it even better in The Case for Faith! Even more importantly, this book gives soul-satisfying answers to some of the most disturbing questions we all ask at times, whether we're religious or not. Whether you expect to agree with the author's conclusions or not, you owe it to yourself to read and seriously weigh The Case for Faith. At minimum, you'll have a better understanding of what so many people around you believe. At maximum, you'll find a truth that will positively impact your life, now and for eternity!"
5,Great gift for skeptics,The author's journey from athesism to belief in Christ is great reading for every Christian and is a wonderful way to witness to skeptics. It is also a marvelous gift for high school students and college-bound graduates.
1,The case for reason,"Strobel claims to be an investigative journalist, but his intellectual dishonestly destroys any credibility that he may have brought to the table. He rarely asks his subjects the hard questions that beg to be asked, and quite often he merely leads the interview in the direction that he wants the conversation to go. This is not an investigation of faith by any means, it is simply an affirmation of one mans faith."
1,Did Nothing to Restore My Faith,"Since the premature death of my mother, I have had a crises of faith. I became an agnostic (not overnight, but after a long perod of reflection). I bought and read numerous books about God, religion etc. This book did nothing but make me angry. Supposedly I am supposed to kow tow to a deity who slaughters innocents for a ""greater good.""All of the explanations about the problem of evil are circular and rely on biblical testimony. The Bible was written by Men and NOT by God. It is not infallible. Strobel cherry-picks the Bible--choosing what is to be taken literally and what is a metaphor for something else. If I were to believe even SOME of the Bible, I would have to conclude that God is at least partially evil in nature.I also have to say that the analogy of the bear in the hunter's trap is the most pathetic thing I have read in a long time.I can punch holes through all of the arguments presented in this book."
5,Faith,Worth Reading again and again! If you are a Christian this book will strengthen your faith and equip you with the ability to better disciple others to Christ. If you are not a person of faith this work will have you re-think your position if you are rational on any level.
4,Discussion Starter,"Like Strobel's highly publicised best seller The Case For Christ, this is written on a popular level and primarily aims to persuade the reader, not to engage the topic in the most rigorous fashion possible. This time the aim is to show that the most common objections to Christianity aren't strong, and thus we should believe in the truth of Christianity.Some more widely read readers may find that this work lacks depth, however I give it 4 stars for the goldmine of information contained in the interviews with top notch Christian scholars. It remains, at the very least, a good introduction to a few of these topics from a Christian perspective. It's also very well written- being an ex Journo, Strobel has fantastic command of the English language."
5,THANKS,"I have just had a daughter.I try to have ""my"" own opinion about GOD because I would like to give it and teach it to her. That's my why.Thanks to this book I am again very interested in GOD and I don't feel I am silly. There are good and clever reasons for being a believer.Read it and give it a chance. You and God deserve it.Sorry for my bad English."
5,Perfect for your non-christian friend,"this is perfect for the average college student. it's not too dense, but dense enough to get them thinking about it. it was an essential book in helping one of my friends come to Christ. strobel definitely has talent to portray complex philosophical ideas to the average reader. i keep several of them within reach to give to that one person that God has put on your heart."
2,A WEAK CASE FOR FAITH,"I did not find the author's arguments for faith to be at all compelling.Examples used a ""evidence"" in many instances were simply the opinions of people whom the author interviewed while preparing for the writing of the book. The case presented was also extremely biased with minimal, if any, counter arguments being presented.The majority of ""experts"" interviewed were of the clergy, so how would one expect those people to feel about faith?"
1,Deep disappointment,I wanted CD's and received cassette tapes. The order placement wasn't clear enough to say I would be receiving cassettes and I felt deceived when the product arrived. It happened on two orders placed at the same time. I followed the steps to do a return but the system didn't recognize me and I couldn't return the tapes to the senders. I don't know how the system didn't recognize me for the return but recognized me to request this review. I'm very frustrated with this experience and don't have the courage at the moment to use Amazon again. If you could take the cassette tapes back and refund my money I would be most appreciative. I've obtained the CD's but feel stuck with the cassettes. Thanks. Ann
2,Where does faith enter the picture?,"I should begin by pointing out that I only read the introduction, and the three chapters that looked as if they yielded any interest.This book deserves 2 stars because if you are a Chrisitan you may find it satisfying. However, the arguments presented are not sufficient. All the chapters are based upon the existence of God except the first one, which does a poor job of making a case. Many arguments here are wrought with falacious reasoning, and circular arguments are a plenty. I do not need to point out them out for they are easily spotted, and some are even contained within the chapters titles. There is no real reason here to believe in God, or believe that Chrisitanity is ""the true path.""The point that really pissed me off is that faith is never discussed. The discussion of faith, being irrational belief, is really an attempt to rationalize. If you want to read books about faith then read Kierkegaarde, not L.S."
4,Most of the negative reviews are absurd.,"I have a question for anyone who picked this book up, read it, then came on here and complained that it already assumes that you believe in the Judeo-Christian God. Did you not see that this is a sequel to his book ""the Case for Christ""? That is the book you are supposed to read if you don't believe in the Judeo-Christian God. Also, you know that it is not going to be terribly in depth just by picking the book up and seeing how thin it is. To cover 8 issues in detail in such a short space would be nearly impossible, but if you want any more detail he provides many sources in the back."
1,Not much to it,"This book failed to convince me of anything. I perceived it be largely circular reasoning based on unsupported assumption, and full of judgments about people who either do not believe in Jesus as the son of God or who are atheists."
4,"Short, Sweet, and to the Point","This book is perfect for those starting to studying apologetics or those looking for answers!The book obviously isn't meant to close the case, but give the bare-bone basics to the answers of the common criticisms of Christianity. This is one of the most basic books on apologetics, and if you feel it doesn't go in depth enough for you, then buy a more advanced book.Also, keep in mind that these are interviews. I think the scholars did a very good job for giving these answers on the spot.Overall, it was an amazing book, but only useful to those who haven't studied these topics much before."
2,Not convinced! (Case for BS...!),I read this book and I am not at all moved by Lee Strobel's arguments (especially the ridiculous one where he justifies why good would send good people to hell). Strobel hides his fundamentalistic bible thumping Christianity in a so called scholarly way and tries his best to convice the read that the valid objections to the Christian faith can be overcome. He just made a greater skeptic out of me. I gave it 2 stars because at least it was presented in a scholarly manner and it convinces many christians and people who believe Jesus is the way to God. They all gave 5 star reviews.I am going to sell this book to a Christan bookstore and at least get some money back. It definitely wasn't worth my time. Lee Strobel needs to find a better way to spend his time rather than argue about the objections to Christianity. Why doesn't he volunteer at a local youth group. In closing I do NOT recommend this fallacious book!
2,Insufficient for deeper thinkers,"These are mild answers to people who have clearly not looked into these matters before. His basis is that Jesus is the only way to Heaven because Christianity is more ""unique"" and ""straight-forward"" than other religions. Even if that is true, it does not validate any claims made by Jesus. The biggest problems they run into is trying to answer the questions by simply citing evidence that supports their claims. Why didn't Lee interview any Muslims or Scientists? The only people that were talking were Christians. It's a completely skewed argument."
1,Nice....if you have a hard time thinking critically,"Blabber disguised as critical thinking. The logical steps the author and his ""experts"" take are disturbing. This is susposed to prove christianity??? Oh, and I love how his first ""expert"" links atheism to communism, slick one there!"
1,book is a fraud!,"This book is a complete fraud. There are millions of people who could give the arguments against theism but instead the author uses mostly theists to give the weakest arguments possible against his view point. This is not, in any way, a 2 sided debate--it is a fraud.Some may think this review is too harsh but remember the whole premise for this book and other books like it is that the author was diligently looking for the best arguments on his important points. To do this without consulting the best non theists is disingenous at best. You have a situation where possibly hundreds of thousands of people who think they got a two side argument and sadly that is not the case.To compound this situation, this author does the exact same thing with some of his other books."
4,Ok Book,Ok book. Well written - There are endless questions that could have been asked. Bottom line: Good read.
1,Complete poppycock,"In case you suspect otherwise, yes I've actually read this book; and Strobel's companion, The Case For Christ. Though it was quite a struggle to continue reading page after page of nonsense. Strobel and his ""experts"" selective use of facts and logic to arrive at their pre-determined conclusions is pathetic..."
1,Old Apologetic Arguments,"The case for faith is built on faith - which is not evidence. The author uses old tired apologetic arguments to bolster his case that, of course, Jesus is God and you should just shut up and obey. The mysteries of the Bible and God are just too much for a small minded human to comprehend so don't even try - its just God's mysterious ways. Keep in mind that Bible literalists believe in unicorns and talking donkeys too. An examination of faith without context is a waste of time. Glad I got this book in a cutout bin."
1,Terrible book,"This is billed as a critical, rational examination of Christianity. However, it is riddled with specious logic, poorly supported arguments, tons of assumptions and ignorant statements about other religions. If you are a Christian and are looking for a rah rah book to justify your faith, this is for you. If you are looking for a critical unbiased examination of Christianity. go elsewhere."
1,Misleading nonsence,I am a muslim and i can state as a matter of fact that a lot of the comments concerning the Islamic religion are taken out of context and are in error. If this is wrong what else is wrong? I approached the book with an open mind wanting to learn something about Christian beliefs but found the innacuracies concerning Isalm jarring which made me wonder what other inaccuracies there may be in the book.
2,Another botch of thermo,"When I first looked through this book, I was impressed with it for mentioning Paul Davies' books, etc. On further reflection, I'm very disappointed with its treatment of sciences. For example, it quotes Christians who are experts in their own fields, but not in the fields on which they speak in this book; a clever dodge all too typical of my co-religionists. Most egregioulsy, it completely botches the discussiuon of thermodynamics and evolution."
1,buyer beware,"There are some good points in this book mixed in with a lot of theologians opinions. Basically what the author did was go to a lot of people, theologians, etc, and ask them the difficult questions that keep people from accepting Christianity. Unfortunately a lot of these are just opinions, like when they were talking about hell and one theologian said that the bible described hell in a figurative way. I don't want to burst anyone's bubble but God described hell as a real place filled with real fire. A lot of opinions make up this book, and their not necessarily the truth.A better book would beKnow What You Believe, Revised and Updatedby Paul Little"
3,Objective....I think not!,"When I first heard that there was an ""objective"" book on the subject of Christian faith...I was extremely interested. Most books I have read default to the structure of ""Here is the answer, and here is how I (we) can prove it"". Lee Strobel initially takes the approach of stating a conflict, then looking at both sides of the ""argument"", then having the ""evidence"" prove or disprove the issue. The only problem is that when the ""evidence"" does not prove the issue, Lee defaults to ""lack of proof to the contrary MUST prove that the Christian faith is correct"". Very disappointing. In the end, it is mearly another book that simply has the answer before hand, and conveniently arranges the information to fit that answer...regardless of whether or not the information does."
4,I view it as a supplement more than an end in and of itself.,"First of all, I'll say that this book is very well written, easy to read, and contains important information. It is valuable for most Christians to read.I will say one that the one problem does not have so much to do with the author himself as it has to do with apologetics in general. People are not ""convinced"" into the Christian faith, they are drawn to God by him. I won't get into the scripture behind this, since those who are Christian are capable of finding that fact, it's all over the place. A Christian can argue until their face turns blue, but a skeptic will always find some way to convince themselves against believing. Conversion comes when someone feels the presence of God.This book is great in that the author makes a good case to support our faith, which strengthens it, and allows someone to give reasons for faith while sounding intelligent. In the end, though, the basis of faith is not in facts but in experience of God."
4,It takes a lot of Courage to write a book like this,"I admire Lee Strobel for writing a book that tackles the issues that most (if not all) Christians and non-christians struggle with. Although I felt that some of the questions were not ever completely answered, the questions were answered much better and with much more logic than any other books I have read on this topic"
4,Great book,This book answers some challenging questions about Christianity and I appreciate the author's approach in addressing them.
4,Well done and an easy read,"4 1/2 really. This is a very well written and researched book. I am very impressed with the quality and the style that Mr. Strobel uses. This is an excellent book for believers and new Christians. Skeptics should read this book as a basis for understanding the true defense of Christianity. Believers will be comforted and skeptics will find good challenges in the pages of this work.I do have one concern for the book. The section about Hell presents the ""flames"" as symbolic for the judgement of God and I see the ""flames"" as literal and part of the judgement. However, even with this issue, the book presents solid findings, and I felt it was very worthwhile."

2,"Without Bloodclot, this is less then a cro mags album","I have to start this review by prefacing, the cromags have not been the cromags without bloodclot... so im a fan from the old days, and quite biased. This has a few songs that have the punky hardcore feel, but to be honest it is much more of a metal album. If I didnt appriciate the musicianship on the album I would have given it one star. I only paid 2.00 for my copy ( used/new from amazon ), and I still feel I got ripped off. If you are a fan of the oldschool, avoid this album, it will dissapoint."
4,A good Wesley biography,"This book by Green is a very readable biography of Wesley. It is a balanced approach and as close to the facts and writings of Wesley as is possible. I enjoyed reading it.J. Robert Ewbank author ""John Wesley, Natural Man, and the 'Isms'"""
5,fine trios,4 STARS because these are fine piano trios but they sound not that great compared to the string sextets though.These are very romantic music here.These are worth hearing of course.
1,Bad customer service.,"I purchased a ram for my old computer from playbox 13. I found the numbers from the ram that I currently have and compared it to their numbers AND photo image which WAS on the website before I purchased it. I recieved a ram that was NOT what I ordered, neither does it look like it AND the numbers do not match. when I complained about it all I recieved was sarcastic comments blaming me for ""misinformation"". I'm not purchasing from this group anymore."
2,Very poor quality recording,"While the two-disk CD set offers the complete ballet, the quality of the recording is very poor. Okay for rehearsals but would not use for performances nor for teaching this ballet as the nuisances and haunting beauty of Adam's score is muddled."
2,(Two stars out of four) Simply not as good as the original...,"Strike One: Traci Lords + Deborah Shelton doesNOT equal Dana Wheeler-Nicholson (Jack's step-daughter). Strike Two: No Deborah Hollard sou-ndtrack and Strike Three: No continuity. Theybarely got the second one out and it's a bitof a rush job. But at least Dennis Christopherand Beanie and Squaid or back! Nicholas Worth(-less!) adds nothing to the chemistry! Half asgood as the fine Circuitry Man, which is fourstars!"
4,Great for Group Discussion,"Someone in the office recommended this book, so we purchased one for everyone in the office and now discuss the chapters at our monthly staff meeting. It provides some thought provoking comments good for group discussion."
3,"Great Look, Poor Quality","I wanted this bag because it did not look like a typical diaper bag and I was willing to pay the ridiculous price to get that look-but it has not performed well. After only 6 weeks of very infrequent use the inside lining has ripped out, a zipper has broken and the bag is impossible to clean. It does hold a lot but you have to really strategize the packing or you won't fit everything in. Not worth the high price tag and I hope Babies R Us will value my satisfaction enough to let me return this item. We have a small Catini bag that holds almost as much, is easy to clean and is super sturdy."
3,Love and Hate,"I love this bag beacuse of it's great color,fabric and pockets in side.And the fact that it does not look like an ugly diaper bag. But after 2 months of minor use the inside lining of the bag begun to tear really bad. And for the price of the bag it really should have stayed together alot longer."
2,Great while it lasted,"I bought this bag December of 2005 and I LOVED IT!! It held everything I needed it to hold, and even when loaded it was not too heavy or burdensome. I got compliments on my bag everywhere I went and I could not say enough good things about it. Until the inside lining started to fray. At first I thought it was normal and didn't pay too much attention. Well, it is now a big problem. The fraying is so bad it gets caught on the zipper anytime I want to open/close it.I contacted BRU and they said they could not take it back as the 90-day return policy had expired. So I emailed Wendy Bellissimo directly and they contacted BRU. BRU has agreed to take it back and I can pick another diaper bag.I am bummed... If I could replicate this one, I would. It was GREAT... while it lasted... I wish Wendy could make them with better quality lining..."
1,HUGE Disappointment,"I searched for days to find the perfect diaper bag as this is my second and last child. I fell in love with this bag. When it arrived I was disappointed it had no protection on the bottom of the bag, ie little feet. I sprayed it good with scotchguard and thought I would carry this bag for many years as on overnight bag after my baby got older. Well, after 6 months the liner is ripping out, a lot of the stitching is coming loose and it is hard to clean. I am very disappointed with this product. Not worth what I paid at all!!!"
1,Why did I buy this book?,I don't know what I was thinking. Weak moments of the mind will allow us to believe things we would normally pass by with a smile. I gave this book away!!!
4,New phone,Phone works great. Too many options and too small for my taste.Bigger than a cell phone but smaller than regular phone. Great reception and range. Much better phone than I've owned in the past. Would buy again but wish the size was larger.
4,Great!,"This is a great phone set! Very clear and crisp. The voice changer mode would come in handy if I were a kidnapper, or worked for crack yankers - neither of which I am or do - but its fun nonetheless."
5,Absolultely Terrific!,"This phone is awesome!! I would venture to say it's the best we've ever had. Great functionality, great size, awesome clarity.. what more can I say? The extra handset was the cherry on top. I tell everyone about this phone."
4,"Two Missing Features, And Therefore Four Stars (after three years)","This is a great phone, and I have had it for over three years. It is clear. The range is superb (in a two story home). The battery life has surpassed about a four or five previous cordless phones I have had. The built-in voice mail works very well.I wish the phone would have:1) ability to expand the number of handsets2) ability to dial in from the base, and therefore have a speaker phone on the baseThe last Panasonic I had, which was much older, had a base speaker phone.Favorite features:* Ability to synchronize address book entries between the two phones* Ability to check voice mail without going back to the base -from the head set."
3,"Volume low, Muffled and Tinny sounding","I am very disappointed. I read all the reviews and figured if 30% of the folks reported something negative, I could still give it a try. Well, the 30% was right. The volume is so low you can hardly hear. Also sounds very muffled. On one call there was a tinny sound every time the person even breathed. I have no idea about the interference issue (which is why we purchase a 5.4 anyway) but if my VTech 2.4 had a much clearer adn louder volume, I am probably going to try that again. Sadly this a beautiful looking phone. The buttons actually work better than the VTech also. And the functions seem comparable w/ the VTech."
4,"Could use a little more volume, but durable!","There are a couple of new features on this phone (since the last 2.4 ghz I had from panasonic). Love that this replaced two phones - I could take the high cost and divide it by two phone replacements! With 5.8 ghz, I no longer get disconnected with my wireless router and the features ok (though I never really have a use for the voice enhancer). I do get the occasional ""huh?"" from people - the volume seems a little low, which knocks it down a star, but it is still rated well - it stands up to three kids!"
4,Great pack of accessories,"I wanted a rain cover for our stroller, and netting for the carseat and/stroller.... this gift pack WITH monkey cost less than those 2 items separately! The covers fit my Graco System very well, and my Jeep jogger-type stroller well enough. I haven't had the raincover out in any real rainstorms yet, but the coverage looks fairly complete, with good ventilation, too. The mosquito netting held up well the times we used it this past August and September. I recommend this product and will probably purchase it for future Baby Shower gifts.I only gave it 4 stars, as a little carry bag would have been nice."
2,Does not fit SnugRider Infant Car Seat Carrier Stroller Frame,The rain cover does not fit the SnugRider Infant Car Seat Carrier Stroller Frame and the monkey is not washable.
2,The Rise of a Weapon,"Historian John D'Emilio wrote something like, ""I disagree with historians who present 'great men' as what changes history. It's really inventions and ideologies that change history."" This work practices that idea by discussing the longbow.How could outnumbered Brits travel to France and win a battle against the French army? Due to the longbow. This work describes why it was helped, mentioning that it was all the rage until guns were invented.This only has one interviewee and he speaks with a soft voice. This is a doc by Brits, for Brits, and about Brits. Americans might not be as fascinated by it. This has lots of cheesy reenactments. However, I give the makers credit because it cost money to hire all those actors and buy all those creative-anachronism props.If you like Robin Hood, Excalibur, Sword in the Stone, this involves factual stuff from that era."
5,Vintage Marianne Faithfull is wonderful!,This collection of vintage Marianne Faithfull is her best stuff!!! Listen and enjoy. Every song is worth the listen!
1,Not the same as the original vinyl.,There are different songs on this CD than were on the original album. They were bad substitutions. The original was much better.
5,Works great & easy to use,This product works great! It covers the grey and it is so easy to use. The shipping was quick too. I will order this product again.
5,Love this Camera!,"Unlike other reviewers I have had no problems with this camera's shutter button, battery latch or otherwise. As a matter of fact, at our first trip to the beach with this camera my one year old poured a whole bottle of suntan oil directly on it and it still works! It even still takes the most amazing pictures! The zoom is fantastic, it works through glass like there is none there, catches action shots amazingly due the quick shutter. And the video feature, talk about great! I wouldn't trade it for anything. I want one for every one of my family members for Birthday and X-mas gifts!"
4,Great camera,"I never had a problem with the battery latch... only thing is when I am turning it off and on, the lens squeaks when it comes out. Taking pics in the dark suck (especially if you dont want the flash)... i was trying to take night pics of my backyard and moon and it came out crappy."
1,DO NOT BUY,"I bought this camera from Sears a year and half ago. I purchased the extended warranty. The battery latch broke and they claim it is from customer abuse. Althought it has no scratches or marks on it, and the latch seems to be the BIG problem with these cameras, I am out the $200 for the camera. DO not recommend KODAK camera for this reason. THE BATTERY LATCH BREAKS and KODAK WILL NOT REPLACE."
3,A mom review,"I bought this camera with money given to me at Christmas 6 years ago. The price was over $300. I never seem to be in line with technology, because now, camera's in this price range have triple or quadriple the zoom and megapixels. Six years ago, I had a great camera, but even then, the zoom and picture quality didn't fully fit my needs. Outdoor shots (distant/close-up), still shots (indoor/outdoor) - this camera can make good pictures - some even professional quality. But for indoor action/indoor distant, and especially indoor action distant - forget it. I have two young sons and getting shots of them playing sports in a gym does not happen with this camera. Outdoor distant action shots are not good either (because of zoom limitations I suppose). I've tried every setting, and unless I'm missing something, this is a very disappointing feature. So this year I am getting, with much research, a better camera and hoping it will be sufficient for the next 6 years!"
3,"Good camera, but...","This is a good camera that takes great pictures. I enjoyed using it, but the camera has one flaw. The latch that holds the battery in place breaks easily. I have replaced this camera twice because the battery latch has broken. I would have one still if it weren't for the battery latch. Maybe if they would change this to a more sturdy latch it would be better."
1,Yet another broken battery latch.,"Batery latch broke just opening the lid to access the SD Card & Battery compartment. I sent it back to Kodak for fixing, but when it comes back, I'm returning it and getting something else. With so many people having the same issue, this design defect should have easily been discovered in testing and eveidently Kodak either didn't test properly or just doesn't care about quality."
4,Great Camera!,This camera is very good for the novice photographer like myself. When I opened the camera at first I didn't know how to take a picture. This camera has little to no learing curve. I was taking great pictures within hours. Great Bang for your buck. I recommend this camera to anyone who wants to learn digital photography.
3,Nice pictures/poor quality construction,"I have owned this camera for 2 years and it needs to be replaced. It takes nice pictures especially when you choose the scene mode which matches the photo you are taking. The hardware easily breaks. As indicated in other reviews, the battery latch didn't last very long before it broke off. The rotary dial to turn the camera on is very sticky. You really need to force it to rotate it."
4,Happy...for now....,I bought this camera about three months ago and was really happy with it. I didnt have to charge it that often as the battery life is pretty god. Unfortunately the battery lock broke after about the fifth time charging it. Im currently waiting for Kodak to send it back repaired but im extremely pessimistic since I read other reviews here fearing it might break again.
1,Broken Batter Door Latches,"I was very excited about this camera, until the broken battery door latch. 2nd different digital camera manufacturer with this problem. Why cant they make a camera with a good battery door cover???"
1,Not Working out of the box,"camera didn't work when I unpacked it, <br />it never worked and I am requesting a replacement<br />if the replacement doesn't work, then no more Kodak <br />for me....ever"
5,Awesome!,I love this camera. It takes just as good picture as a regular camera if not better! You can take pics and if you don't like it (e.g. if someone blinks) then you can delete it right away. You can also pick out which pictures you want developed and what store you want them developed at and there ya go! Or if you have a nice printer (which I do) you can print your own. I highly recommend this camera.
5,Kodak D7630,"I love the easyness of this camera, we have one at our school and I use it very often. I love it but I can't print pictures though the printers because the megapixles are so high it jams the printer. But I'd still recomend it. It is wonderful"
2,Battery Latch,"Add 2 more broken latches. Since Giving the camera as a Christmas gift it has had the same part break twice. Even the in store display camera has a broken latch! This week the camera is getting returned. <br />The Canon A95 looks to be the next best option, too bad i already purchased a 512 media card for the Kodak. :("
1,"Nice Camera, if it didn't break.","The camera takes great pictures; however, the battery latch broke the second time I took the battery out. I took it back and had it replaced. I was extremely careful with the new camera, but the latch broke a second time. I am taking it back today to get a different camera.I bought Kodak because I had always thought they had quality products. Not this camera."
4,Love it!,"If you can't already tell I love this camera. I am a complete novice so I needed something ""easy"" but still wanted beautiful pictures, of course. I've had this camera for 6 or 7 years and have just one complaint. My battery latch broke also, and that's why I gave it 4 stars. It just broke last year though, so I've lived with it. Because of that, the battery compartment door would come open by itself at times and the battery would fall out. Really inconvenient because then you would have to go through resetting the time and date...etc.I took it on my recent honeymoon to Tahiti and you wouldn't believe the colors it captured. Absolutely amazing for a fairly inexpensive camera."
1,poor quality,"I also had the battery latch break within the first month. I returned the camera for a new one, and the latch broke several weeks later. I decided to keep the camera anyway, but after a year and a half, the flash quit working. I was offered the $135 repair or a refurbished Z650 for $199. I can get the Z650 new for $210 at Circuit City. I also have to wonder, why are so many refurbished cameras available? Stay away from Kodak, even thought it took nice pics."
3,Mediocre but user friendly,a good entry level camera but don't expect miracles. lot of photo bleach. poor video. sturdy. battery superb. over-all an avg. camera for every day use. if you are investing 200-300 bucks u might as well consider entry levels DSLRs.
3,"Love the camera, battery latch faulty","I bought a different camera after the 3rd battery latch broke. I love this camera other than that. I MEAN LOVE. I am thinking about buying one again and keeping my new one as back up (obviously due to the dang battery latch). It is easy to use, takes pictures quickly (tough feat in the digital non-pro world) and has a very nice quality. Stupid latch is my BIG hang up."
2,short life expectancy,"Great camera and performance for the price but low quality chinese contruction. Had camera less than two months and the wheel that controls on/off and other functions failed. Now back at Kodak in Rochester N.Y. for repair. Hope for replacement.This is a good camera when it works. Awesom pic quality at 6.0 megapixel as well as lower settings. The only problem is the quality of the manufacture. But, you get what you pay for!!!!!!"
2,ANOTHER BROKEN BATTERIE LATCH,I GOT THIS CAMARA WAS HAPPY WITH THE PICTURES IT TOOK. THE FIRST TIME I REMOVED THE BATTERIE TO CHARGE IT THE LATCH BROKE.I AM ANOUTHER UNHAPPY COSTUMER.
5,Grandsons loved it,"I bought this for my 6 year old grandson, who loves anything to do with nature. He and his 9 year old brother have spent many hours looking at picyures and reading the info."
5,wonderful book!,"This book hasnt been put down since we gave it to my daughter for her 6th bday, along with other outdoor adventure items. So colorful and informative for them to understand. Would buy this in a heartbeat again !"
4,de Fossa Guitar Trios.,"These are enjoyable and tuneful works, played marvellously well by three fine players, and with a clear and vibrant recording ambience. The same recording is available in local stores with an enclosed booklet of comprehensive written notes about the composer, the players, and the works. The CDs bought from Amazon lack the booklet of notes - a serious disappointment. But it is a lovely recording."
4,A nearly perfect cozy Celtic fantasy.,"The Grey Horse is another reread in my recent trend of going through the fantasy and science fiction novels of my youth to see if any of them are still really worth keeping. I had only a very dim idea of the story before I started. I remembered it much more clearly once I had read the opening. By the end of the book, I had a hard time remembering that I had ever forgotten.The novel is an extremely satisfying fantasy cozy. Fairies are real. Supernatural men, at least, have good taste in women. Politics can be overcome by communication correctly applied. True love is possible in the face of any barrier. Magic is as familiar as it is frightening. Wrap the whole thing in smooth and very readable writing and tie an Irish flavor around the package, and you have a very nice way to spend a few hours.MacAvoy's books seem to be largely forgotten these days. That's a shame, and I will keep an eye out for second-hand editions."
3,Very fruity beef jerky,Tastes like a fruity beef jerky. Someone else tried it and they hated it but I didn't mind it. High sugar content though.
1,whats wrong with everyone?,"I read the reviews about this and got very excited. I got the book in the mail and dove into it. 95% of the reviews I read gave it a 5 out of 5. Theres no way it could be bad right?? WRONG!I understand creating character development, I would rather have it than not. But for one thing if your gonna write a book about monsters don't wait 150 pages before you bring them into the picture. Second, when the monsters showed up. ARE YOU KIDDING ME????? They were so laughably stupid had I not paid 10 bucks to read this book and went through 150 pages I would have laughed hysterically. Their medicine balls with tenticles and they cary knives! WHAT!?!?!!?!?! I stopped after that. No reason to go any further. This book was horrible."
1,Maybe I just have a high tolerance..,"But I didn't find this book or any of his others to be exceptionally gory or scary. People who think his stuff is gory and/or scary need to read Edward Lee, Charlee Jacob, and Wrath James White. Also, old school James Herbert, Clive Barker, and Shaun Hustaon, along with R. Patrick Gates. Now those authors get gory, and scary.To be fair, though, I don't see all the misogyny so many people get their pants in a twist over. And yes, I'm a woman."
4,Stephen King meets Michael Crichton,"I first heard about Earthcore when I stumbled upon [...] Earthcore was one of the works displayed in a rotating banner of popular downloads on the site and it was the first one I tried due to the intriguing realistic drama-horror sound of its summary.Earthcore definitely delivered with that pseudo-genre. It reads a bit like a horror film and thus might be predictable to some but its varied cast of characters and slowly revealed secrets make it worth it.As the title of this review states, Earthcore is very much a melding of Stephen King's thriller-type books with dashes of violence and notable anti-heroes who may or may not eventually become heroes and Michael Crichton's ""techno-thrillers"" with moderate technological and scientific underpinnings.I ended up purchasing a copy in print just so I could share it with my friends who don't care for audio books.In short: if you enjoy either of the above two authors, give this book a try."
5,"An exciting read, and very highly recommended for all science fiction enthusiasts","Earthcore is an exhilarating science fiction thriller in which Earthcore, a courageous mining company, determines themselves to be in charge of harvesting the world's largest platinum deposit ever discovered. Readers will follow Earthcore's young executive, Connell Kirkland, as he dives into the increasingly costly project as the three-mile-deep mine shaft becomes home to more then just platinum. An exciting read, and very highly recommended for all science fiction enthusiasts, Earthcore would be a popular addition to community library SciFi collections and documents Scott Sigler as an effective, entertaining storyteller."
5,Excellent service and shipping.,Gave this book as a gift. It was shipped quickly. Buying it and using a different ship to address was not a hassle. I own this book and its a good story.
2,"So-so story, horrible writing.","The story was okay. I bought and listened to the podcast version. I was disappointed with the writing. I found it distracting. The language used by the characters was unrealistic. (I spent four years in the infantry, and I would never have addressed friend, subordinate or enemy in the language these characters use. Can anyone say ""Law suit""?) The overuse of bad similes was silly.Sigler is to be saluted for his imagination and his industry, but he might want to befriend an editor.As I listened to the audio version, I suggest he check on the pronunciation of his words as well. One example: The word is SUBsequent, not sub-SEE-quent."
4,Good fun!,Not the best novel ever. But it is a great little romp of sci-fi horror.Sigler's attention to detail and imaginative creatures make this a great small print book.
5,Excellent Read!,Very nice book. The author did everything correct for my reading style. Packed with action and techno details. I am currently reading another Sigler book and it appears to be just as good.
1,Not enough information to make a purchase decision,"I don't know what the lead of this nut is so I can't match it with a screw. I would like to purchase a Kerk screw and matching anti-backlash nut, but I can't from this listing."
5,a winner,"A good stylish cap, which announces your loyalty without looking like you want to be on the field on a a hip hop video. Unlike the team, will last a full season and beyond."
3,Does not do Nielsen justice,"This recording of Nielsen's magnificent 4th and 5th Symphonies is somewhat lacklustre. The players are too restrained and seem unable to commit themselves fully and project all the color and emotion of Nielsen's highly original music. You keep wanting them to break loose, but it doesn't happen. The Danish Radio Symphony recording on Dacapo is head and shoulder's above this one."
4,raygu,"Confunkshun 7 is a great cd. It was one of those albums i always wanted in high school but could not afford. It is awesomely digitally remastered. I remember this album was the follow up to the disappointing touch album which was the band's one mistake on mercury records. Standout cuts on this cd are bad lady,the smooth ballad straight from the heart which i never knew was on this cd,the funk drenched body lovers,and if you're in need. Confunkshun really put the stank on that one. I would highly recommend this cd to any lover of old school funk."
4,Which is Witch,"The Occult Experience was a great way to see some people that are not usually seen. Some I actually have met in the years that I went to Pagan festivals. It was wonderful to see Margot again, and took me back to the days when we talked. It was also great to see Stewart and Janet Farrar and to see the eccentricity that is legendary of Alex Sanders. The only negativities I had was the addition of the Radical Christian exocism. It seemed out of place. I felt that the section on Giger was out of place tooIt also didn't draw enough of a line between the differences betrween Witchcraft and Satanism, though that was explained. It overall was trip down memory lane."
5,5 stars,I had been having an enormous difficulty trying to translate the concepts of validity and reliability for the qualitative section of my dissertation. My chair-person recommended this book and boy...was I ever glad she did. The section on Establishing Trustworthiness is especially well written and gave me a clear understanding of how I wanted that part of my methods section to look.
1,Poor Quality,"The quality of this product is not good. After having this produst about 3 months and about 5 uses, it got so noisy that it sounds like it is going to fly apart. I contacted the supplier and they said they only guarantee their products for 30 days. Not near worth the $60.00 we paid for the product. Also poor customer service from the supplier."
3,Not as powerful as my Panasonic,"This works, but I miss my panansonic which isn't made anymore and had a roller dial to control intensity. This is just high or low and the high isn't quite high enough for me which I realize I am in the minority. Most people will probably think this product is just awesome. I guess I was spoiled! ;-)"
2,too loud,Well I really thought i was getting a high quality piece not a loud obnoxious toy. Thats all I have to say!
1,POOR QUALITY,Having only used this item a dozen times in the last 4 months only to find that it no longer works....very disappointed.
2,Hitachi VS. Adam & Eve Wand (no refund policy on this item),"The Hitachi wand:You CANNOT get a refund on this at this s i t e, if you are not satisfied.Does Not have enough power.Attachments are awfully uncomfortable. They are hard & painfully uncomfortable!! Ouch!Also the white bulb is not very soft, pliable, flexible.Switch is funky; having to go between off just to get to high, and bad placement on handle.This Hitachi wand is also shorter than the A&E; (which IS nice)....Here I thought this was the same thing as the Adam & Eve wand. It is NOT!! We had the A&E; wand for 3-5 yrs... (just now been getting hot really fast last 6 months)...The Adam&Eve; d o t c o m wand is SO much stronger... the buttons are placed in a better location on the wand, and you don't have to go between off to get to high. And the bulb is softer, more pliable/ more comfortable. AND.... they will ALWAYS guarantee you satisfaction or your money back, no questions asked!! ; -)"
5,Nothing works better!!!,"I bought this for my sub, FWB. Needless to say she has never had bigger orgasms! She kept killing batteries and motors with regular vibes. This takes the constant use with no trouble and makes her spray like a hydrant. Money well spent!"
1,"very bad quality , device stopped working after 3 days :(",this wand massager is very famous so that I decided to but one. I am so frustrated because It has stopped working after only two times in 3 days. Each time of use was about 5-10 min. I contacte the seller who advised me to contact the manufacturer. I find it is very annoying to buy a product online and then you find it non functioning so you have to go through the headaches and pains of re-packing and re-shipping the device. When you pay money you expect some good products and good quality. This is the second time in Amazon. I have decided not to buy any electronics or electrical products from Amazon. My advise to you is to read the negative reviews on any product rather than the positive ones which is usually not all true.
5,Glad I finally got one!,"Researched this ALOT before buying. It is a little spendy but worth every cent. Works great as a massager for someone who suffers fromfrequent tension and migraine headaches. Also does things ""elsewhere"" that cannot possibly be described i words! The attachments are pretty much a waste of money and just sit in the closet collecting dust. As someone who shyed away from this thing for quite awhile due to price...I wish I would have just pulled the trigger and bought one years ago!"
5,happy wife = happy life,"no more hassling with dead or dying batteries at the worst possible times. this thing is full power whenever you need it. i recommend buying an extension cord, though, since sometimes the outlet may not be close enough to the bed or couch or whatever. not sure why there are 2 attachments, though. the curved one seems to work best, and i can't see much use for having both. not much really needs to be said - this product is a wise investment to improve your quality of life - the title prettymuch sums it all up."
4,love it,"the hitachi is amazing, it gets the job done all the time. it heats up after more than 20 minutes of use, so keep that in mind. its super strong and the attachments are even better. however i only recieved ONE attachment when the picture clearly shows two. :( overall its a great product, i see why most women have it."
2,For Ones Who Like It Very Rough,Product came as described. No issues. We used it once and haven't since. She said it was way too much power and that she couldn't feel the sensation. Just way too much. She went back to her minature dolphin which seems to do the job in a fraction of the time...She compared it to riding a zero turn lawn mower...Sorry.
1,Really used,I would hesitate before buying a used copy of a paperback again. In this case I had no choice cause I did not see any new copies available.
3,Scientist runs for his life with new technology,"When the first manned Mars mission returns from an alien-populated Mars, they radio ahead with one scientist's adaptation of alien science: a kinetic force shield. Big mistake - now all the governments of the world want his prototype for themselves, and will kill anyone in their way.Fleeing into Earth's underground to meet up with the mob, the lone scientist tries to survive long enough to keep his invention from becoming the ultimate superpower device.This is an old novel, and some of the plot is dated, but fits the general American setting. The kinetic force shield is seen in various other sci-fi, from Issac Asimov's Space Ranger novels to today's Stargate: SG-1 series."
3,Good Story - Unexciting Ending,"At first I had a hard time jumping back and forth between modern day and the middle ages, but after a while I was able to hold both parts of the story in my head. As someone else mentioned, it really was the only way this story could have been told. I actually enjoyed the story very much, but I was disappointed by the ending. I was expecting some plot twist, or an unexpected interpretation of what the grail is/was, or at least for the story to end with a bang... but nothing. It just sort of petered out. The last chapter didn't even have much to do with the story. It was 2 years later, and no new tidbits surfaced. It was just sort of a philosophical summary of what one of the main characters learned, and was written in a totally different style than the rest of the book. That was pretty disappointing."
3,It's good but........,"I liked the book. Her take in the grail legend is fascinating. I also find the switching past/present stories tied together nicely. The flaw comes from her revelations or lack thereof. After reading the book, there are some items that the author never quite explained. **SPOILER ALERT** Like 1) Where did Marie-Cecile finally get the third book. Did she get it from Audric if so where did Audric get the book? Was he the one that knocked Alice in the beginning when she discovered the cave? 2) Why does the grail only shows up for Alais/Alice and not Marie-Cecile? 3) What is the face that appeared that scared Orianne and Marie-Cecile? 4. Who was Orianne's lover when she insulted her husband, was it Francois, Guillem or some nobody that was placed there to show what a slut Orianne was. 5) Whatever happened to that sinister Crusader captain that was also looking for the books/grail. I could go on and on. It's just too many questions left unanswered."
2,A book in need of an editor,"I have no objections to complexity in my historical fiction, but this is a book in desperate need of an editor. One of the sections that takes place in 2005 refers to an ""old-fashioned typewriter"" sitting on a bureau. Aren't all typewriters old-fashioned now? At that point I stopped reading the story for plot or characterization (there wasn't much of that, anyway) and start reading for laughs. (The ""battered stone Jesus"" looked like a rag doll? How is that possible? A hotel was both ostentatious and magnificent? Isn't that contradictory?)If you're looking for superb historical fiction, read ""The Meaning of Night"" by Michael Cox. Labyrinth doesn't deserve the rave review it was given by the Washington Post."
3,New Take on Grail Legend,"This book was a very interesting take on the Grail Legend; however, I think that this book could have been 5 star and was only 3 star. The plot could be plodding at moments. There are two linear stories followed through the book. The story of Alais in 1209 and the story of Alice in 2004. I personally think that the stories may have been told more effectively by telling first the 1209 story and then the 2004 story, as opposed to jumping back and forth. Also, I found that the climax of the story was a little lacking. Overall, I would recommend this book for persons interested in grail legends, the Cathars, and/or Medieval history."
3,"Good, solid read","Mosse's story focuses on the idea that the Holy Grail was moved to southern France during the Crusades. It's an intersting twist on the story and the parallel narrative proves interesting. I thought the novel started a little slow, I really had to push myself through it to become involved enough to not want to stop reading after an hour. At times story lines become a bit too mingled and lead to confusion while at other times it's difficult to find a motive for certain characters. Possibly the huge scope of the novel became difficult for Mosse to control at points.All in all, a good, solid read. I could have used some more background/history as it might have helped with some of the confusing plot lines and motives."
3,Good but not exceptional,"I enjoyed the plot and execution. I loved seeing two females as leads; different from the usual. Really enjoyed the parallel characters from different time periods, the thirteenth century and present day. I didn't find the switch at all disjointed. While it wasn't a gripping read that I just couldn't put down, and I found the dialogue rather stilted during the initial chapters, I found it an enjoyable read."
2,Don't read this book...,"I made the fatal mistake of looking at how well this book was doing on the bestseller list and looking at how many stars this book was given by the community, before deciding that i would read this book. However if i had looked at some of the comments, i would have seen this book is no where near the caliber of a 4 star book more like a 2 star.Please don't make the same mistake i did with this book, save your self some time and go read two Dan Brown books. You will be able to finish those in the same span of time you would working your way through the lethargic pace of this book, and you probably enjoy it 2x as much.And if your still our bent on reading this book just wait until you get to the ending of the book, it left me with this bitter taste in my mouth and the thought 'i read 500pgs and this is the ending i get? Wow! thanks Mosse, for wasting several hours of my life that i will never get back...'"
2,A Loooooooong slow read,"The author takes waaaaaaaay too long to tell you the significance of the labyrinth, the ring, the books, etc. and leaves you wondering why you should even care about it in the first place. All explanations come out at the end of the book."
4,Very Good book!,"I found this rather unknown book by accident. I am glad I did.I must admit that it took about 100 pages for me to get into the book, but it was a quick read from there on.Kate Mosse weaves this story of the past and present beautifully. She reveals only enough to allow you to start forming a guess about what will happen next; then she side-swipes you and has you changing your mind all over again.The characters were well designed, the plot was driven (after the 1st few chapters) and the backdrop was vividly described.I only hope that I can find more books by this author; if her other offerings are as good as this book, she will be very successful."
2,Kate Mosse promised but didn't deliver,"On the back of the book, the author writes: ""The Grail legends are usually about men with swords and women getting rescued. I thought, 'You know, I want the women to have the swords.' It's all about them doing their things, they get lots of sex...""This motivated me to read the book, but the author didn't deliver. The women are constantly getting rescued from their impulsive decisions. However, they get equal opportunity for torture, abuse, and gruesome deaths. There is *not* lots of sex. There is virtually no consensual sex. What there is is a derivative present/past narrative where the present day characters are physically identical descendants of their medieval selves. I thought it was well differentiated from the DaVinci Code, and sure, the French setting was well detailed, but generally it left a sour taste in my mouth. If you like war and violence with a dash of romance and mysticism, this book is for you."
2,Disappointing,"Mosse has taken an interesting historical context and layered on a contrived, hard to believe story. While the book is a fast, sometimes engrossing read, it is ultimately a disappointment."
3,A literal labyrinth,"This book is too long and annoys with all the words in different language. There is no need to use another language, with so much frequency, in a novel.I finished this novel simply because I wanted to see the twist of this grail. It reminded me too closely of Katherine Neville's The Eight - a much better book than this one. In fact the jumping around from past to present is an almost carbon copy of The Eight.I'm giving this book 3 stars because I think the past was written better than the present.Oh, and I think Alais dumps Guilhem too quick after finding out of his infidelity. Were not men more dominant back then? Didn't their words weigh a ton? Whatever they said went? But, remember, a woman wrote this book. This is what Kate Mosse would do in the present. Kate Mosse would receive a treatment that Oriane, Alais' sister, received by her husband (in the novel). Oh, and that's probably the most exciting part."
2,"After 275 pages, I started to like","With all the favorable hype this book had, I looked forward to breezing through this - thinking the coordinating stories in 2 different times would be as exciting as Neville did in 'The Eight' - So much of this novel let me down. I did not connect quickly with the characters, which is rare for me, although after about 225 pgs I did. Perhaps it's the time and the area that didn't catch me. The Cathars have been written about to pieces recently, and the ties that bound everyone and everything tested the bounds of patience - not my favorite take of the Grail Legend. Worth finishing, but not the classic I had hoped for."
1,Disappointed,"I was looking forward to reading Labyrinth as it had come recommended by a friend and I am a devotee of the game Carcassonne. How disappointing! I thought the plot preposterous, the characters too one-dimensional (good or evil and no in between) and the writing sloppy."
4,Labyrinth,This was an interesting read once it got going. The story jumps from modern to historic times and weaves the lives of several people. I enjoyed it.
3,"Detailed, but tedious","This is a tough book to read. It flips between present day and medieval France, which makes it difficult to follow and destroys momentum. There is little suspense or intrigue, and the story flows like molassas in January. There is a lot of detail and the book seems well researched, but it needs some serious trimming to make it less of a chore to read. This certainly didn't inspire me read any more of Mosse's work."
2,Boring and Scattered,"While the Da Vinci Code brought some long needed respect to the ""sacred feminine"", this book takes 5 giant steps BACKWARDS.Good premise, could have been an interesting, intriguing book - but I think it failed miserably.I didn't feel that the main character(s) commanded attention, and the flipping back and forth was tedious and distracting."
3,Slow,"Good plot, I saw where she was going. However, it was a slow beginning then anticlimatic. Also, their was a lot of French that I had to bypass because I didn't know what it meant. I didn't find out until later that it was a short glossary at the end. However, all the French words weren't in it."
3,just OK,"Well, it's not that bad but a little too long. The prose occasionally falters and the author's comparisons & similies leave a lot to be desired. Honest effort but a little weak."
1,way too violent!,"I'm half way through the book and decided to get online to see what others say - and I agree! It is not very well-written, too many unnecessary details, the main characters are not likeable and most important of all for me, it is way too violent! This is the most violent book I have read in years and I expected something more entertaining like the DVC. Kate Mosse is the co-founder of the Orange Prize for Fiction? How come she doesn't know how to write?"
2,Too long and involved,"I am not going to regurgitate the plot or characters as that has been done sufficiently in other reviews.I enjoyed the recent spate of novels about Templars, hidden Christian codes, and the like. This book, however, droned on and on until its eventual conclusion and not that good a one at that. The use of of a foreign language was annoying and not necessary for the tale to progress and the constant flux between present and past was disrupting. It no way compares to the pace in Brown's book."
1,Misses the mark: at once tedious and violent,"One of the few books of historical fiction I can remember that I do not look forward to picking up. I think I will finish it because I am thrifty and do not want to have wasted the money. The device of switching between times is neat, but the overall work is labored. The air of gloom and frequent acts of violence do not enliven the plot."
2,"The good ""girls"" were so incompetent, I was siding with the bad!","I listened to this CD, and I know the author spent probably years researching and writing this book, but the two sets of heroes, from the thirteenth century and the present, were so totally incompetent I yelled at them while listening, which must have looked very funny to people passing by. And Mosse waited until Disc 13 to explain who exactly the Cathars were and why the nasty French hated them. Both Alys and Alice were smart but so young and naive as to be beyond belief. They and their companions kept having their secrets stolen, being lied to and beaten up and rounded up and knifed and and and . .Enough already! If this is a feminist DaVinci code, give me rewrite!"
3,I wish I'd read the reader reviews before wasting my money,"It was alright, reasonably entertaining, just nothing to write home and all your friends about. I did enjoy the history and scenes from southern France, but I wish the author had kept the story in the 13th century and skipped the stuff from 2005. I still haven't gotten around to reading the DaVinci code, so I can't make comparisons as other reviewers have.If you want to read more about this period of french history, the cathars, knights templar and the grail, try Elizabeth Chadwick'sDaughters of the Grail. I could not put it down. It is currently only available used in the US, but the author has recently rewritten and republished the book in the UK and is available on Amazon UK now. Hopefully it will be available in the US soon, as the used paperback is quite spendy (although worth it). If you're set on reading this, save your money and get it from the library first. Then if you absolutely love it buy it. JMHO."
3,"Interesting theory, but...","I was highly recommended this book. I was told ""if you liked the Intelligencer, The Historian, the Da Vinci Code, then you will enjoy this one too!"". Well... it has an interesting theory about the Grail and I really liked the Cathars history, but the book as a whole didn't really grab me. It is slow and as soon as you meet the characters you know who ""they were in the past"" and what will happen..."
1,Let me out of this Maze!,"A pair of incredibly stupid women separated by time and re-incarnated, who are supposed to be the ""good gals."" But they are so dumb as to be completely unaware of the plots around them. And the plot? To get the three book of the old, weird, ancient, and holy ""Trilogy."" Which will lead the lucky person to the Holy Grail, which in turn allows them to, dare I say it? Live forever! Ah, that pesky Holy Grail is at it again. It will not stay lost or dead. And a word to Kate Moss, I am really happy you speak French, but most of us don't want to. And Watch out! As for our heroines, Xena and Gabrielle they certainly are not. This soap opera is basically Katherine Neville's ""Eight,"" but not as well traveled geographically, nor does it have funny cross-desert jaunt in a convertible by the two gals."
3,Abit obvious,I enjoyed this book but it suffers from a) too many characters b) too long and c) predictable ending.It did however spark my interest in the Cathers and I am now looking for appropriate history books.I was in Carcasonne a couple of years ago and that added to the read.
1,Glad I'm done with it. No more books by this author for me!,"I actually enjoyed the first couple of hundred pages of the novel. The character-development was rather slow, but the people in the book were reacting in ways that made sense. Then, in an effort to get the story from point A to point B, Mosse suddenly flattens the characters to two dimensions, forcing them to do things that are completely out of sinc with who they are. At that point, my reading rate slowed because I just wasn't that interested in picking up the book anymore.There were two unforgivable flaws, as I saw it. First, I could feel the writer's impatience to get to the end, in the way that she forced the plot for so much of the book. Second, she was lazy in checking for errors. I mean, when a character goes to sleep in a cottage, and then wakes up the next morning in a hotel, you've got to wonder.The story might have been good if a more mature writer had written it and more importantly, if it had had an editor worth the name."
3,English please?,"I got this book through my book club. I expected it to be on the order of other Holy Grail books, and the premis of the book is good. I liked the story, what little I could understand. I don't speak, or read, French, therefore a LOT of the book was gibberish to me. There was a ""glossary"" at the back, which was useless, because the few words given were pretty common words that are either easily understood, or we have picked up along the way. I finally looked up Cathers, which I'd never heard of. Parfaits were finally explained at the end of the book. I KNEW they weren't a dessert, but...I liked the parallel stories, but GEE! if you're going to write to an English-speaking readership, at least write in English!"
2,"Interesting idea, but execution didn't work","I'm attracted to suspense and adventure thrillers regarding the Grail legend (and other religiously oriented thrillers). The reviews looked promising for this book and it started out well.But sadly the execution just did not work. The constant back and forth between present and past was jarring. The convenient name similarities were simply too convenient. And due to the past-present switching, the motivations and attractions of the characters just never develop deep enough for me to care about any of them. The only thing I did begin to care about was the south of France, which sounds wonderful and mysterious.Worst of all, the ending just did not make sense. I don't mind endings that are left open for the reader to wonder - but this just ended, with such vague descriptions and flat execution, that I was very disappointed."
3,Heavy Going!,"In Labyrinth we have two stories, one set in Carcasonne in the 13th century, and another set in modern day, in the same area, involving a discovery in a long abandoned, hidden cave.This book should have been a cracking adventure, but I found it fairly heavy going, particularly the 'modern day' story. The parts set in the 13th century were interesting, and had more developed characters, and a better story, weaved around true events of the time, but I found myself skimming through parts of the 'modern day' story.I felt too many weakish characters were introduced in both storylines, which had me backtracking to see who exactly was who, also. Three stars at a push."
2,A-maze-ingly mediocre,"This preposterous mishmash of a DaVinci Code ripoff wastes the skills of a decent writer and the promise of a fascinating period of history. The first scenes, set at an archeological dig, are Crichton-level silly, but I was interested enough to keep reading into a pretty absorbing parallel plot set in medieval France. Mosse's skill and research shine in the first episodes of this plot, but soon her awful attraction for cinematic ""action"" kicks in and the whole thing degenerates into one far-fetched chase scene after another. Worst of all, she doesn't bother to extend her obviously extensive research into the period beyond daily-life details--we learn nothing about the Cathars or why anyone would want to kill them. Two stars just for interesting me enough in the subject to put this book down, unfinished."
3,OK but not great,"I saw this book at the library but was in the middle of another book so decided to buy it from Amazon. Got it from one of their best merchants. So far in reading the book I have been disappointed by the book, it doesn't read as the description had suggested. It is not anything like a Dan Brown novel and not very fast paced. It is just OK, nothing I would recommend."
2,Very disappointed,"I tried to like this book, I was very excited to read it with all the hype and reviews. It was so slow and boring. I started it over and over but could never get into it. I finally just gave up."
5,Loved this book,"This book was great. It did take a little while to really get into the really exciting parts but it was so very worth it. You do have to remember, though that the author is not American, so to the American reader some of her phrases sound a little off.I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a good historical story. Just remember that it's fiction....a lot of people who have reviewed this don't seem to understand that fact.I couldn't wait to find out the ending but at the same time didn't want the story to end. I still want more of this book!"
3,"A Weak Grail Recount Attempt, A Good Romance Novel","I think the title sums up my review. I tend to give this book a 1-2 stars on mystery and action scale, 3-4 stars on both historical and romance scales.This is actually a very good romance novel. Female readers will sure enjoy this novel better than most male counterparts. Typical to most lady writers, details are presently vivid on the characters and actions they did.If you are looking for a Da Vinci Code-like thriller in this book, you might as well forget about it. I almost abandoned this book after 100+ pages of nothing. But I strived to finish it, since Miss Mosse is one of the Orange Award on literatures, and she must have some ""muscle"" at the end. It did have some muscle. It was a good recount on historical accounts of Alaise, superimposing the plot with current day Alice Tanner (who is Alaise's descendent).Not recommended for anyone looking for a fast paced story, but recommended for romance and historical buffs alike."
4,"Overall, an enjoyable read","I buried my nose in this book and read it in a few (long) sittings. I was intrigued by the historical background and the connections between all of the characters. There are definitely some issues left unresolved at the end, and I agree with the earlier posts about the need for a better editor, but it is an engaging and fascinating story. If you can suspend disbelief and immerse yourself in the story, then I recommend this book to you."
2,Way too long.,"This book could have done with being half as long, I had to force myself to finish it, as it was it left huge plot holes, was often tedious and went at a snails pace. It also left the reader with a load of questions, I still don't get what the grail really was, and if the books were so dangerous and brought only unhappiness to the people whose life they prolonged then why didn't someone sensible destroy them and prevent the deaths of thousands of people?I give this book 2 stars because the story itself could have been interesting if written differently. As it is it's farfetched and boring. If you want to read something good, go read the Da Vinci Code."
1,A tragic misfire,"Characters, concept, pacing, arc, structure, editing, pacing. This is MY subject, and I'd read nearly anything about it. I've NEVER put a book down mid-way. Till' this... what a sad, disappointing waste of months, reading aloud with my beloved wife, both of us actors, stuggeling in vain to breath understandable life into this messy tom. Editor, you should hang your head in shame... author, don't quit your day job. Sigh... trashbin. Grrr!"
5,a very good book,this is one of the good ones if you are looking for a historical adventure story. the historical details are well researched and are neatly combined with the modern day story line. i highly recomend it!!
1,Waste of time,"Books like this upset me; it upsets me because there are so many good out there and I was fooled into reading one that isn't. This is 500 pages of trite, clichéd, anachronisms. The book is a waste of time. There is zero character development, just uninteresting two dimensional characters doing the same thing seen in hundreds of television shows and movies. Labyrinth demonstrates a total lack of imagination.There are too many other great books in the world to waste your time on this one."
2,"Not bad, but not great","Don't come to this book expecting the pacing of the Da Vinci Code. While it is not as clear cut or gripping as DVC, it is still entertaining.That being said, it is incredibly long and drawn out in the beginning, and the end is incredibly muddled. Again, not horribly so, but it is confusing and the reader is left in the dark about many things.If you are planning to read something weighty on a plane, this is your book. Of course, if you mind having some significant plot holes and confusing characters, go for it. Not a total waste, her descriptions of things are good and it is a fairly romantic book. But not exactly something that will win any awards."
3,could have been better,"This book left me cold. Considering the rich history of the Cathars, this author shortchanged them. I found the language a problem. I speak no French and I certainly don't speak southern French which is what she uses. One cannot even find a translator on the internet for the language of the Cathars. Anytime an author does this, I think the author is not writing for the general population and keeps the author on a pedestal above her readers. I found the characters not flushed out enough. They seemed a little lean. They were just the vehicle in which she moved the story. I think her books are more cerebral than heart. I did read it to the end as she does weave an interesting story. I probably won't continue with her new book though especially since she does that pedantic language thing again. Listen, if you are going to use a foreign language, translate it for your reader's sake."
2,A difficult read,"I'm halfway through Labyrinth and questioning whether I will bother to finish it. I wanted to like this book, but it has never really captured my imagination nor given me any reason to care about these characters. I wish I could explain (to myself) what makes one work of fiction so involving and so compelling and another so flat, even though both authors seem to be reasonably competent. This one just doesn't do it for me."
1,"Terrible,Terrible","Back & forth 800 years difference,but still the story line sucked. The ending was impossibly stupid.Nuff said."
1,I couldn't finish it,"it's rare for me, but I couldn't finish this book. by page 150, I simply did not care at all about the characters or what was going to happen to them. I actually bought the book for my husband, who asked for it for his birthday, even though all I had to do was read the cover and realize he'd hate it. which he did--he stopped at page 150 too. Everything was incredibly predictable, the characters were one-dimensional (at best), and completely unsympathetic. The heroine(s) were the kind of women who only exist in ridiculous bodice-ripping romances, and, apparently, this book. typos were way too frequent, which makes me think they rushed this book out to ride on the coattails of the Da Vinci Code. Just bad. Don't waste your time or your money."
2,Labyrinth is a Labyrinth of Characters and Story,"Labyrinth is a labyrinth of characters and story. There were too many characters to keep track of, especially considering the two main characters live several hundred years apart, adding to the confusion. Also, a good portion of the diaglog, names, etc. are in French, leaving me having to work way too hard. The extra work keeping track of everyone, every place and every thing would have been worth the effort had the story been exciting or interesting (i.e. Da Vinci Code). However, the story dragged on and on, and didn't really go anywhere. And, the final disappointment comes at the end....after forcing myself to finish the book, there is no reward, because no secret is actually revealed."
2,"Other ""Grail"" stories are better","I was disappointed in this book. It was bogged down in too much detail concerning the battles that took place and was otherwise disjointed and confusing. Your time would be better spent reading ""The Eight"" by Katherine Neville."
4,Decent read...,"I picked up the book, mostly for its sections dealing with heresy and such like stuff; I liked the historical aspect and how skillfully the author weaved between the two time periods. What I like is to learn from books, to discover new ways of living, and little facts I never knew before. In that aspect, this book was packed with information. What I didn't like was the present timeline. The historical parts from Alais's point of view were well-done, interesting, and fast-paced, whereas the parts from Alice's points of view (or Authie's, Marie-Cecile's, or Will's) were jumpy, annoying, and not at all interesting. The book so easily could have been shortened by 150 or so pages. But it was a decent read. Alais's scenes boosted the book's score from two to four, but if it had been completely her novel, it probably would have been a 5. Alice and her team just weren't interesting enough characters for me to want to read further. Only finding out about the past kept me reading."
1,Couldn't get through this.,"This book starts out good but just fizzles out. It didn't hold my interest at all. Too dry. I like to be inside a story, not outside looking from a distance."
2,Not Worth Your Time,"I read this book because I was told it was interesting and good. After the first couple hundred pages I was asking, ""When does it get interesting and good?"" 50 pages from the end I was still asking the same question.This is a story split in time. You are jumping back and forth between characters moving through time in a similar manner. Kate Mosse did a good job of getting both stories across. Alice, who is in some ways in both times, leaves much to be desired. She is supposed to be the strong female character that drives the story. That keeps the trilogy together. That answers all the questions. But, in reality she fumbles from place to person and around (in both times). She was not the strong character that was promised.In the end the story leaves more questions than answers and you will wonder, ""Why did I just read that."" The Labyrinth, Holy Grail, or whatever it is supposed to be is never really decided on, you'll only see bits and pieces of it."
4,Very entertaining read,"I just finished the book and I have to say that it was a fairly entertaining read. It starts off a bit slow and confusing, but once it gets going I felt it difficult to put it down. Sure, it might seem a bit long in parts, and the characters might seem a bit flat, but overall I can't say that I felt 'bored' by the sometimes lengthy descriptions. The plot more than makes up for it. The constant flipping between middle-ages and present kept the suspense high, and I very much enjoyed the in-depth historical research that went into the plot. Unlike many of the reviews here, I can recommend it."
2,TOO MANY ADJECTIVES,"Two women are caught up in the same riddle despite being separated by 800 years of history. At the center of the mystery is a stone ring, a carving of a labyrinth, a cave with two skeletons and the Grail. Sounds like this would be a truly interesting read doesn't it? If you are a reader who enjoys voluminous pages of description interspersed with small bits of action....you will find it in this book. The jumps through time are clumsy and weaken the story, not to mention that far more questions are posed than are answered. If you have an interest in French history, this book may be to your liking, however if you like more action in your reads, than you should pass on this one."
2,Disappointing,"I was looking forward to reading this book for so long, and unfortunately I was disappointed. The narrative is so confusing! For the first 75% of the novel I was struggling to make sense of what was going on. It is one thing to try to create suspense, but it is entirely another thing to leave the reader in suspense of what is happening for over half of the book! Only towards the end did the novel start to become more descriptive in what was actually happening and who all the people were.I do see what the author was trying to do- with the skipping back between time periods and leaving each part on a cliffhanger- but unfortunately it was done to extremes. I was just so confused. I wanted to finish the book more to make sense of things than because I was interested in the outcome.However, one positive thing is the descriptions the author gives of the south of France- they are lovely."
3,An okay read,"I was a little disappointed with the book but made it through to the end. I thought there were too many details and characters, some with very similar names so I found it a little overwhelming and began to skip over parts. I liked the dual story lines as I knew it would link up at some point. I did begin to enjoy it more toward the end as I was waiting to tie it all together but this was still a little weak. I am still not sure what the author was claiming the Holy Grail actually was, maybe it was in one of the parts I skipped!"
2,The story still hasn't started,"I'm about 20 chapters into the book, and I'm still waiting for some kind of plot to develop. I understand the characters, I think, but there is no connection. There are two time periods involved, and there is no way to mentally connect the two at this point. I want to keep reading, but getting past the foul language, sexuality, gore, violence and finally the rape of a girl... and I'm done. I'd much rather read a story than be dragged along, made to endure details and events that have no application other than grossing out the reader. Good try, but no thanks."
2,Needs a good editor!,"Highly researched, but it feels like after an acceptable first draft the author ran out of time. An editor should have tightened it up. There are a lot of continuity issues that could have been improved upon, too.I'm now interested in the period and the location, but I'm putting the actual book up on PBSwap (and I keep books I like)."
1,A Waste of Time,"This book came highly recommended from a friend, described as a ""page turner a la the Da Vinci Code "" by Dan Brown. I have a keen interest in the grail legend and related novels, so I eagerly anticipated reading this book. Trust me: this ain't no ""Da Vinci Code"" -- and you won't be seeing any movie made from this hopelessly confused story. It was all I could do to finish it. Very poor writing. I felt like I was inside a cheap harlequin romance novel. Gag."
2,Lapses,"Am I missing something, or do we never find out what happens to Shelagh at the end? Will carries her unconscious body out of the cave. The rest of the plot is (mostly) wrapped up, but Shelagh is never mentioned again. Does she live or die? After reading several chapters devoted entirely to her point of view, it would be nice to know.I also found some of Alice's lapses infuriating and inexplicable. A cop gives her a message with a phone number and then is run over, and she doesn't think to call the number to see why he might have given it to her? Later that same number turns out to be connected to the missing Shelagh, and she still doesn't call it until she's outside the corresponding address? When she receives a letter from Audric Baillard, she doesn't bother to open it until hours later?The idea of this book is better than its execution."
1,amazingly terrible,"I am not certain what the fuss about this book is/was but I could not and would not allow myself to get beyond how similar the speech patterns of 13th century France and the 21st century sounded. Take away the curse words and they spoken nearly the same. At least in the Name of the Rose and others, there was the introduction of phrases that might have been spoken at the time into the story. I didn't get that here - in fact, I would never recommend this book to anyone.It's amazingly terrible."
3,Fell a bit short,"I loved the idea of this book, but it fell short. It had some really great bits, but dragged a lot too. The simile madness didn't help. I think excessive similes can work better in humor but not drama. I liked the numerous female characters, but overall they were missing something, like the ending. Still it was a good read."
4,this book,"This book sucks you in and takes you on a ride. The history, the geography, all very tangible. However, I can put it down so that is what the one less star is about."
1,Absolutely awful,"I picked this book up because of a favourable review, saying it was a new take on the Holy Grail, well written, and suspenseful. The review was wrong on all counts. On the basis of this book I won't be picking up any works by Mosse."
2,Boring,I stopped reading this book about half way through. I thought it was not well written and it just couldn't keep my interest. Maybe it was because I read 3 really good books in a row right before reading this and it just couldn't compare.
2,Not Again,"How many Grail/Templar/Jesuit/Inquisition conspiracy books are going to be published? Stop the insanity. If you must read one, find Umberto Eco's Foulcauts Pendulum. The only literate, original book in this overcrowded genre that I have read. This is not orginal in any way, and Ms. Moosse would do better to move into romance or suspense novels with her style, or lack thereof."
1,Bloody awful!,it's starts with a good sypnosis but then flunks afterward. Too much info and overdramatize in so many scenes! Maybe if the book was edited down to 300 pages less it would had made a great book. Too much like Dan Brown's da vinci code.
3,"disjointed structure, fails in feminist attempt","at first i thought it was the most disjointed non-sensical novel i've ever read - until i got to the end. then all the pieces fall together like a giant jigsaw puzzle. the book doesn't spoon-feed the reader, but leaves the reader to connect the dots herself. pretty unique structure - feels like watching ""syriana"" or ""good night, and good luck"" - but everything comes together in the end. however, despite kate mosse's claim on the back cover, ""grail legends are usually about men with swords and women getting rescued... I want the women to have the swords"" - the main character really is nothing more than a stubborn chick who gets herself in trouble and has to get rescued time and again by men.- grammatical errors are only errors if the author does not intend them. whoever narrow-mindedly judges the quality of writing based on the rigidity of conventional grammar obviously has never read faulkner or dickinson."
1,Just tell me how it ends...,"After plodding through 486 out of 509 pages, I just can't make myself read anymore. The book was recommend by a dearly beloved relative, but even love has its limits."
1,This book was disorientating,"I had to put this book down after only 75 pages, because of the use of the non-word ""disorientating"" 4 times in 6 pages. Where the heck was the editor??? I could deal with the pacing and the historical inaccuracy of 13th century French fields growing CORN for heaven's sake(!), but after realizing that Mosse decided that ""disorientating"" is an actual word, I could just not bear to read another paragraph.If you want to read well-researched historical novels with heroines who have a head on their shoulders, read the Regency romances of Elizabeth Mansfield, or the White Mare and the Dawn Stag...I'm just glad I got this book from the library instead of having purchased it.Putnam should be ashamed to let a book get published with the obvious lack of editing that this one had."
3,Cute Ghost Costume,"This is a cute costume, but a light color must be worn underneath as it is a bit thin. Do not count on using the ""wig,"" which is really only a couple of strands in the front...what you see in the photo is ALL there is, I threw it in the trash because it looked so very skimpy. There was nice flow to the ghost cape. Fair price for the product."
4,Thought provoking,"I have always wondered how the evil of government can be tolerated by good people. This book has been a splash of cold water to the face of complacency. The author has woven a web that ensnares you and demonstrates that evil can only prevailing when good men do nothing. The author has captured the inner struggle humans endure . The easy course is to accept the of status quo ,to be safe to have a nice safe life. Then there are the hard soul wrenching choices . The choice that could end your life but save your soul. The book is set in Nazi Germany but it could happen anywhere people sacrifice and suffer from an all powerful government."
5,The start of my jazz years,"Great to see this album re-released in the one package (plus the two extra tracks not on the original release).This is the album that converted me to Mel Torme, apart from the two ""hits"" comin home baby and right now it contains some fabulous arrangements of some of the emerging standards of the time. Until this album I was a presley and darrin fan. Never again. Along with undercurrent (Bill Evans/Jim Hall) and Ella in Berlin it changed my musical life for the better."
1,The sound of the CD is less than poor,"This estimation is not for the music or vocal, but for the sound of thisCD only! The remastering was made with large damage for the sound. It isa very pity, that I did not read the review for this CD, which was writtenat July 27, 2006. That review is objective absolutely."
4,Another look at the afterlife,Nicola Lindsay writes a wonderful novel which gives the reader an insight into another route in the afterlife. Her characters are warm and funny.
5,great,"I have a variety of stands for my IPad but this is one of the most functional to use. The tension level when adjusting it is great, providing selectable viewing angles. It don't take up any space and also pack away very nicely when I'm traveling, especially when flying it works great on the little tray table . The cost is well worth it and they are stable in both landscape or portrait even when using the sync cord. The stand grips the IPad nicely because its rubber coated, and limits movement well.I even ordered more because I gave one away to a woman struggling to hold her book on the plane. You just can't beat the cost and the fast shipping on they stands, which are small enough to actually put in your pocket if you needed to, but fold flat enough to work great in any type of bag or purse."
5,Excellent for my Tablets,"The order comes with 2 of these display stand. We use them for 7"" Android tablet, Amazon Kindle Fire (also 7""), and iPad 3 (with smart cover). These stands are excellent in term of functionality and price."
3,Over Priced,"It is a good quality item, but overpriced compared to other offerings. There is only one piece and I made the purchase based on the prior reviews. When I checked further, the same item is available at a about half the price."
4,Good Item at a good price,I bought this wire holder to be a stand for a tablet computer. This wire holder is a lightweight alternative yet sturdy enough to hold up my tablet. There are hinges at the tips which allow it to adjust the angle. This is a very good low cost alternative for the expensive stands you can buy in stores.
5,Perfect for displaying plates or holding up the Kindle Fire,"My kids made handprint plates at school and I needed something display them on. These Gibson Plate Holders were perfect. They bend to hold the plates at any angle, but the joints are stiff enough to stay upright. I don't worry that the plates will fall over.As an added bonus, I can also use these plate holders to hold up my Kindle Fire. In fact, they're absolutely wonderful for that. I have one that's going to be a permanent fixture on my desk; but if I need to take it with me, it folds up and hardly takes up any room.This was a real prize to find. Color me happy."
5,Cheap and sturdy,"I purchased two of these stands because I sell on ebay and wanted a better looking way to prop up my items for photographing. The size is just right to hold DVD cases, most of the old retro cartridge games, and CD cases, as well as larger items. I'll probably use the second one as a stand for my new Samsung Stratosphere phone. I'm sure they're good for iPads as well but I doubt I'll be getting one of those any time soon. The vinyl coating on the metal should be good for keeping them from slipping. If you do use it as a stand for an e-reader or tablet, I'd suggest covering the hinges with electrical tape since I suppose it would be possible to scratch your device by accident.Come to think of it, I might be able to use it as a stand for regular books depending on the size."
3,I guess it's okay,"The forth book wasn't what I expected it to be; it was getting kind of boring. And I think that Anna+Ben couple is getting old. I really liked the begining of the A-list serie but now, I think that it's only a bad version of Gossip Girl."
4,Preety Interesting,This A list book was OK. Defentily not as good as the fourth book. Ben just had to come back. he annoys me. I felt really bad for Dee when they put her in the physco ward. This was an OK book.
5,i want you to hear it,full moon wants her doctor to listen to her song its so wonderful this anime and in terrific condition thank you pam brown :) please see if i can fine volume 8 9 or 10 if they are available i would be very grateful this show is great! love pam brown :)
4,A favorite,"This book was a hit with my family and friends. It is the story of Sam Abbot, an English professor in the middle of a life crisis, who suddenly finds himself in the world of espionage. Sam's adventures are interesting and exciting, but the biggest changes are those that occur within himself. An engaging and enjoyable read that I still revisit every now and then."
5,Find space for this one on your shelves.,"Grouped here are the best and most interesting works Saint-Saens composed for violin and orchestra. The Introduction and Rondo capriccioso is the best known and most frequently recorded. The other smaller items are well-crafted pieces, while the concerto is an especially engaging work.Guilty sometimes of giving undue prominence to soloists in concerto recordings, Naxos engineers here achieve a perfect textural balance. Notice how the trombones are allowed to overwhelm everything with their ""chorale"" towards the end of the last movement until the violin soloist, at comparatively minimal volume, is once again allowed to be heard.In terms of sound quality and balance, this is one of the very best concerto recordings I have heard."
5,We Move as One,We Move as One track is produced by Wetton/Downes...The fantastic writing pair and the vocal/bass and keys of the supergroup of 80's Asia...they also played on this track too...If for nothing else it's worth getting this album for this great song!
2,Fair CD,"This CD is not bad, but not good either. It is one of Agnetha's post ABBA era CD's. She was much better in the ABBA years."
1,Mid 80's roadkill,"This is not a good album. The choice of songs is simply bizarre and begs the question: if this is the short-list, how bad must the other offerings have been?! As has been commented elsewhere, Agnetha barely gets out of the lower registers, and therefore, gets little opportunity to showcase her great voice. Over-production only adds to the woes. There is no sparkle here, no soul and for the most part, this is not like any other Agnetha record. Easily the worst offering from any of the females post-Abba. Avoid."
3,poor track choices,"You have to wonder what's going on, when Agnetha and Eric Stewart put rubbish like 'click track' on the album, which has nothing to commend it, then leave off 'you're there' and 'turn the world around', two of the best b-sides from this period. What were they thinking? Particularly, as the former is a ballad co-written by Agnetha herself.The outstanding track on the album is definitely 'the angels cry' a beautiful lush ballad with nice guitars and atmospheric keyboards. Justin Hayward of the Moody Blues wrote this and it just demonstrates his immense talent."
5,Classic Soul Gem,"This is truely a wonderful album. Although it's labeled a funk album because of a couple of tracks, don't be fooled the is classic seventy soul at it's best. Gloria Scott was a protege of the great Barry White and along with Tom Brock they crafted this wonderful album. This album plays like a complete thought which is truly rare nowadays. If your looking for a great soul album that defines it's era, look no further."
3,I don't expect this to last,"My daughter got this for Christmas, and although she loves it, I am just waiting for it to break. All of the stablemates items are so cute, but are not that durable. The legs break off the horses, and the plastic is very brittle. Anyway, I knew this when I bought it, but still decided to get it. Just be aware that it will need to be played with carefully if you want it to last."
5,Bisengaliev plays Wieniawski Superably!!!!!!,"I think the previous reviewer is crazy as a three legged rat; these performances are Awesome!!! These pieces encompass some of the most difficult violin scores to master, but Bisengaliev tears through them like a Sunday Stroll through the park. His performance is First Rate! If you enjoy Paganini, Joachim, and Sarasate, then Wieniawski should be included in your collection. If you hadn't noticed Wien. was Polish, therefore most of these pieces are Folksy Dances. They are the Chopin equivalent of the Violin, unbelievably virtuoso music. Wieniawski has his own style and uses ricochet bowing, double stops, harmonics, and a few other tricks. If you enjoy 19th Century Virtuoso Violin, you will not be disappointed with this CD!"
3,Mediocre,"Wieniawski was such a formidable violinist that his show off pieces are practicaly impossible to play. I would like to let know to Leslie Gerber that Wieniawski was, by unanimous consent, the best violinist of his time, just like Paganini.Zdenko"
5,"definition of uplifting, euphoric trance","tiesto has long defined the genre, fitting more into a mold than any other top notch dj out there. while digweed may have gone through a 'heaven scent' uplifting phase, he's now more clearly defined as the gu019 digweed with the dark sinister grooves. tiesto, on the other hand, has continued with the uplifting trance that first made him famous, even to today.now, with the huge wave of progressive sweeping the dance world, this style of uplifting trance may seen a little outdated, but the truth is that euphoric trance is still alive and well. this is one of the few cds that should be instanteously identifiable, with the slightly lower bpm yet highly visceral trance music that clearly defines tiesto.female vocals all around on this cd, adding to the effect. a definite work to cheer you up.tiesto's best work. five stars."
4,Tiesto is the king of the Netherlands!!,"This cd is a very good mix of progressive trance. The cd begins with an incredible track and continues in a really ambient and trancy style. Towards the end of the CD, the pace begins to increase to become extremely energetic and moving. If you love to listen to pounding trance, this cd will take you on an emotional journey that ends in complete delight. Starting in an ambient fashion, the pace slowly builds until it overwhelms you. This is the best Tiesto CD yet!!"
1,"Not Chicago,Detroit or NY HOUSE......","If You like BT.....you will like this album......If you like Moodymann,Farley,Orb,Juno, you will hate this album......But if you like BT.....ITS GREAT.......ALL sounds the same......1500 CLUB"
5,ISOS - So good,"I now own all 5 in the ISOS saga, volume one being the last I acquired. It fits right in with the rest as far as quality Tiesto mixes."
2,I'm Still Searching...,"I'm not going to elaborate very much on this purchase. I thought it was below par. The only mix I cared for was BT's ""Mercury & Solace"", which I already have. The rest of the CD was fair--nothing earthshaking as far as I'm concerned."
3,just get summerbreeze instead,"I bought Tiesto's ""Summerbreeze"" album a while back and it is still one my favorite trance CDs to date. I bought this CD after seeing the rave reviews others gave it, only to be somewhat dissapointed. This CD has several of the same tracks on it as ""Summerbreeze""... only different mixes. The ones that weren't on ""Summerbreeze"", I have heard on other trance CDs, and mixed much better. If this CD looks appealing to you, just go out and buy ""Summerbreeze"" instead... and make sure you listen to track 10."
4,Perfect,"I have only one thing to say: the entire, ""In Search Of..."" series is a must have if you like DJ Tiesto. In these albums he is at his absolute, most-beautiful best. And that is the last word on that. To think that, at one time, I didn't think I liked his stuff. I became a big believer and collector after having heard these three."
4,My Favorite Tisto,"I haven't heard all of Tisto's CD's, but out of the 4-5 I have heard this is my favorite so far."
5,Awesome!,"What a great album! Every track here is awesome, I kept waiting for a song that didn't excite much but the album just kept getting more and more amazing! As mentioned by others, track 9-10 equal good track placement, but the whole album flows well. My personal favorite track has to be Sun is Shining! I wish that song would last another 5 minutes, it was pure bliss for me. I HIGHLY recommend this album, one of the best trance mixes out there if not the best (imo)!"
5,One of Tisto's best CD's,"This CD is definately one of Tisto's best albums (together with ""Live at Innercity"", ""Magik 4"" and ""Magik 6""). This CD gives you a feeling of what a Tisto set would have been like on sunny Ibiza in the past summer. The CD starts very slowly, almost ambient like. You immediately get that summer feeling of partying on the beach. Slowly the CD speeds up and ends in an incerdibly energetic set on which you simply can't sit still. You have to jump around, dance, run, or whatever, to get rid of the enormous energy buildup in your body. Until 2 months ago I lived in The Netherlands, and I have to say I really miss going to Tisto's live sets. But whenever I feel the urge to hear him now, I usually take tis CD.If you like Tisto and/or this CD, I also reccomend DJ/producer Ferry Cortsten and DJ/producer Armin van Buren. Both Dutch as well; they both have that incredible Dutch trance sound I miss so much.Enjoy this CD of the world's best trance DJ!"
3,Much breadth but little depth,"There are many good books on speech processing, but not too many also cover music processing. In that sense, this book is good. However, the major shortcoming of this book is that in its attempt to cover many topics, it doesn't really cover any topics in great detail. The material in this book is merely a good introduction, but one is forced to go to the cited references to find more detail on specific subjects. My overall feeling on this book is rather neutral. If you are just interested in speech processing, there are other books out there which have better coverage. But I am still look for a good book that covers the signal processing of music."
1,Blah blah blah,"I picked this book up because I'd only read good things about it and what a wonderful writer Anne Tyler is. However, I guess she's just not my cup of tea. I had no feelings for any of the characters, the storyline was all over the place. One page, the characters were one age, the next they had suddenly aged 10 years with no warning. I found my mind wandering too much while trying to follow this boring story of a loveless marriage that I put it down after 100 pages or so. I don't think this book represents a ""typical"" marriage in any sense of the word---if it does, then that just makes me sad!"
4,Painfully poignantly real,"This book was a real gem. I won't rehash the plot but just give a few impressions. The relationship of Michael and Pauline was utterly believable. We understand their attraction and the reason for their marriage. We understand their unhappiness but see that in the midst of it there is real love, and real happiness. The description of Michael and Pauline's divorce is when the book is at its best. Michael leaves Pauline--and it would be perfectly plausible for him to return--there was much to salvage in the marriage. They never even tried marriage counseling! But it is is also perfectly plausible that he not return. As is typical of Tyler's novels, each character is painstakingly and meticulously realized, so that the reader is left with the feeling that she has recently been visiting with friends. A lovely book with much to say about marriage and family, love and loss."
2,Am I missing something?,I am so disappointed in this book. I am a faithful Anne Tyler fan. I've read all her books and loved them. I was so looking forward to The Amateur Marriage. I bought the hardcover as soon as it was available. I'm halfway thru and can't find the motivation to finish it. I don't care about the characters; the story is plodding and uninteresting; and the writing is sophomoric. I find it hard to believe that Anne Tyler actually wrote it. It just doesn't measure up to her previous work.
5,Anne Tyler at her best,"A very perseptive book about a mismatched couple and how their live evolves with each other, their children and with other spouses. It shows how 2 people who are decent try to make a marriage work but seem to lack communication skills or realize what is wrong with the marriage.If you live Anne Tyler, you should enjoy this book."
3,Not one of Tyler's best but still worth a look,"I think I've read everything she's written and this, though I don't think this is her best, I enjoyed exploring another of the world's that she so deftly creates. Her characters are always interesting and complex, I just didn't connect with them as I usually do with her books."
3,Disappointing,"I bought this book because I rate Anne Tyler's work highly. Her characters are believable and (usually) endearing. An Amateur Marriage was, however, disappointing and fairly depressing. There didn't seem to be any point in the author telling the reader about the marriage - the couple basically weren't suited and consequently made each other unhappy. Nothing more, nothing less. I kept on reading in the hope that a meaning would emerge somewhere, or that something halfway good would happen, but it didn't. Not worth reading again, ever."
4,"Deeply insightful, just short of a masterpiece","I can see only one flaw in Ms. Tyler's otherwise excellent novel--she observes and narrates with an affection and respect for each of the characters, and her insights into people are uncanny and brilliant, but she doesn't provide hope or inputs on how to cope with a mismatched marriage. So it created despair in me."
1,A change for Anne Tyler,"It seems to me that The Amateur Marriage marks a change from what I`ve come to expect from Anne Tyler. I`ve read most of her books but was greatly disappointed with this one and those that followed. The absurdities of life, as pointed out by Ms Tyler, made her books a must for me. In this book that playfulness seems to be gone and what is left is a description of sad lives with little relief. In the past, much was said without hitting the reader over the head."
4,Great Characters,"Anne Tyler once again has created a cast of memorable characters, most notably the infuriating but touching Pauline. She shows the perils of marriage and the need to be extremely careful about picking your partners. I also liked the sweep of the book, stretching from World War II to the present.My only disappointment was the rather tidy ending, which I felt short-changed the complexity of the relationships and the characters. Even so, no Anne Tyler fan will want to miss her latest."
2,No point to the story,"I have never read an Anne Tyler book before, so I guess this was not the best one to start with. The story line was so vague. Tyler never really developed any of the characters or the story. After I was finished with the book, I had so many questions that never got answered. The ending was so anticlimatic. It was almost as if, she just got tired of writing it so she just decided to end it all of a sudden. Based on all the reviews, it sounds like Tyler really has written some good books, but I don't think this is one of them."
3,Disappointingly simplistic view of marriage,"As an Anne Tyler fan, I was deeply disappointed by the missteps in this one. The language was ordinary, the ideas were nothing new, there were many jarring flaws that relate -- in a way -- to point of view, which made me think this was intended as a young adult novel. A kind of gee whiz breathlessness on the part of the supposedly omniscient narrator that didn't seem to fit, to my eyes and ears. Overall, this isn't sophisticated or demanding in the least. She tells us how different these two people are rather than showing us."
2,An Amateur Novel,"Not one of my favorites. Did not keep me engaged. I did like the way she revealed the story. The plot line had a unique pace. Felt that she failed to develop a few of the minor characters (who ended up with greater roles). My suggestion: If you area a diehard Tyler fan, wait for the paperback version. Otherwise, skip it. Read Running With Scissors."
1,Characters that don't have an ounce of truth to them,"This is perhaps the third Anne Tyler novel that I have read, none of my own volition, mind you (this one was a book club pick over my objection). I wish I understood the basis for this author's fanatical following. I found the characters in this book, as in the other Tyler novels I have read, to be wholly unlikable and bear not even a passing resemblance to folks in real life. Has Tyler written any novels featuring a heroine who is not ""madcap,"" ""flighty,"" or somehow ""delightfully batty??"" Please. It was a chore to read this book. I could not connect with any of the characters. Tyler (perhaps unintentionally) does a fairly good job of making each character seem to have no redeeming qualities, but then in the next sentence she seems to want you to empathize with them. If I could have given this book a zero rating, I would have. Don't waste your time with this just-barely-above-a-harlequin-romance book. It's a ""Lifetime"" movie waiting to happen."
2,The Amateur Novel,"First of all, this book was written on such an elementary level in its prose and format. There was absolutely NO character development. You see no discussion of how Pauline or how Michael and Pauline's marriage impacted their kids lives. Why didn't Karen marry, isn't it ironic or not that Sally (George's wife) is so much like Pauline. What was it exactly that led Lindy to leave? If Michael's second marriage was a dessert and the first one was a missed entree, what was the lesson?This book was so underdeveloped in every way. The reading level, the characters. I kept hanging on thinking that Anne Tyler would tie it all together in some fabulous way. It was pedestrian at best. If this book was written by a newcomer and a first time novelist, then fine. What a huge waste of my time."
3,Just okay,"I don't think I would have picked this book out on my own but my local librarian recommended it so I read it. I liked the idea of separating the plot into the different decades of the characters lives but I ended up feeling left hanging, wanting to know more, at the end of each section when it jumped ahead 10 years. It was interesting to look at how life changed over time though - how the world changed and how the characters changed along with it.One major part of the story focuses on Michael and Pauline's daughter running away from home. They find her years later in San Francisco with her young son, Pagan. I think I would have enjoyed more development into these characters. An offshoot of the book written from the perspective of Lindy would be interesting."
4,Very good work of fiction,"I really enjoyed this book. This was a good, solid story that kept you turning the pages (or, in my case, pushing ""play"" since I listened to the unabridged audio book version). There was so much realism in the book which showed the story behind the facade (representative of many marriages).The only reason I gave it four stars instead of five is because the ending was a little disappointing. I wish I could give it 4.5 stars as it really didn't take away from the book that much.Overall, I definitely recommend this book! Enjoy!"
2,Half-baked Novel,"Ann Tyler's latest novel was a big disappointment and once again it leads me to wonder what the professional critics were thinking when they wrote their rave reviews. The only possible explanation is that the disconnected, superficial, unspoken, unexplained relationships in this sad family were symbolized in the disconnected, superficial and poorly developed characters, composition and story line. It has however continued to hang in the back of my mind, inviting me to make my own sense of the many missed opportunities each person had to look honestly at themselves and each other. I would appreciate some candid comments from the author as to where she was taking this book."
4,sad but good,I always meant to get around to reading the Accidental Tourist (also by Anne Tyler) but I read the Amateur Marriage instead. What is next? The Wonderful Author? That is what I think author Anne Tyler is after reading this book. It is unsettling but that is because of the story that will seem familiar in some way to most people who read it. But the writing is very good. Author Anne Tyler is a wonderful storyteller.
2,Almost unbearable,"I keep coming back to Anne Tyler because of ""The Accidental Tourist"" and ""Breathing Lessons,"" but I've finally lost faith. The opening chapter is nearly unreadable, with its fake folksiness that leaves you feeling like your mind is coated with sticky syrup. This stilted, phony prose seemed vaguely familiar, and then I realized that it sounded like the narrator of the play in ""Waiting for Guffman.""It loses some of its false sweetness after the first chapter, but then we're stuck -- once again -- with an uptight, orderly man and his ditzy wife wondering whether they're totally incompatible or perfectly complementary. She's written this book so many times, she gone from perceptive and insightful to cliched to self-parody."
2,Not her best...,"I have read at least 10 of Tyler's books, and have loved almost all of them. Unfortunately, this one just falls short from the get-go. I stuck with it, hoping it would pick up, but it just never happened for me. The characters are just not very likeable; I did not find myself endeared to any of them. Let's hope this is not the beginning of a downward trend!"
2,I've read Better...,"The Amateur Marriage is probably one of the most boring books I've read in years. With that said, Anne Tyler manages to drag it along with her lively descriptions, true-to-life settings and what seems like some heart-felt emotion. At every scene, I kept wondering why Tyler was taking me there only to be let down when I realized there was no climax building--it was just the end of the scene. Borrow it from the library if you must read it."
3,"""Like a trapped dog""","Michael and Pauline should never have married. He was too conservative, too quiet, too staid, in contrast to her impulsiveness, high emotion, and quick temper. This book chronicles the marriage of two people who got together during wartime when emotions ran high and marriages were undertaken with too little thought as to the consequences of a bad match. Their constant wrangling effects their children and they pay for their mistakes in unexpected ways. This novel is gloomy, its characters depressed, and there is little of redemption in its pages. The ending, which suddenly seems to bring some light into the picture, is too little, too late. Michael and Pauline's runaway daughter, Lindy, characterizes their family as a ""tangled knot, inward-turning, stunted, like a trapped fox chewing its own leg off"". Uplifting? I think not!"
2,"Another disappointed Tyler ""fan""","Has Anne Tyler become the ""Seinfeld"" of the literary world? Like Jerry Seinfeld's description of his popular comedy series, here is a book ""about nothing."" 50 years in the life of Susie Homemaker?--BOring!!! Everytime I thought an interesting thread was developing...WHAM! It was the end of the chapter, and the next chapter began...in a setting usually 5 or more YEARS later. It's no wonder Lindy got out of there as soon as she was able."
2,A disappointed Anne Tyler fan,"I love Anne Tyler for her quirky but totally believable characters. In this book the characters were quirky, but totally unlovable. In short, I really didn't care what happened to any of them. The book is like eavesdropping on one long argument between two people I don't care about. I had been waiting for her to write a new novel, and was really disappointed by this one. Try Saint Maybe instead."
1,"Unlikeable characters, contrived & flat","I hated this book. The characters were flat, contrived & unlikeable. The story went quickly enough & had enough plot twist to keep me interested, but the characters seemed only concerned with themselves & their own feelings. For all their self involvement they were not the least bit self aware let alone aware of the people around them. What a miserable bunch!! Life just sort of happened to them & when they were unhappy it was always someone else's fault. Just awful."
2,Out of Steam,"Anne Tyler is a novelist I have loved and respected, but the present work is simply not worth reading. Is a worn out story by a possibly worn out writer. The characters are uninteresting, the story is the same, the writing is uninspired. I gave it two stars for effort and possibly because of the writer's stature. John Updike had covered this territory brilliantly in the Rabbit series. I simply don't trust reviewers anymore, this is a bad novel and I haven't seen anyone say that except the ""peoples"" reviewers here on Amazon who I will always read now that I have thrown away good money a couple of times on novels not worth spending time over that conventional reviewers lauded.Phooey."
1,She's Lost Her Keen Eye,"This is perhaps the fourth book by Ann Tyler that I have read and I realized after completing it, I continue to look for and hope for the bite, the razzle-dazzle keen eye she had for the human condition found in her earlier work.Alas, it isn't in The Amateur Marriage. This book has a cast of completely forgetable and unlikable characters, mundane plotlines and conflict, and no real developmental arc to any of them. If this is her subtle metaphor for life and marriage, well, thanks, but that's not my experience and that's certainly not why I shell out 25 bucks to read fiction! I like real life portrayed presented through the language of a gifted wordsmith--someone who can take ""ordinary"" and hold it up as extaordinary--she's done that before! Life's too short and I'll probably not waste another minute of it wading through another Anne Tyler novel."
3,"Though Interesting Characters, Book is Anti-Climatic","You grow to enjoy reading about these characters, but you hope for something more for them. You want to see the ""do"" something...but it very anti-climatic and you don't understand exactly why the people are the way they are. You want to know more of their thinking..."
2,The Annoying Marriage,This novel simply follows a bickering couple and their inabilities to let anything go. I became very frusturated with the book but finished it with complete relief that it was over. Not recommended if you want a real read.
3,Tyler is a genius but this book is a pass,"Anne Tyler is so abundantly talented that you hate to say anything negative about her most recent book; however, this novel is not in the same league as most of her other touching work. Of course, you will get flashes of her genius, but I found these moments very brief and much less heart-wrenching than those in her other novels. If you've not had a chance to read all of her great books (lucky you!), then take a pass on ""Amateur Marriage"" and pick up ""Breathing Lessons"", ""Accidental Tourist"", ""Saint Maybe"", ""Ladder of Years"", ""Dinner at the Homesick Restaurant"", ""Earthly Possessions"", ""A Patchwork Planet"" etc. Tyler is truly one of our best writers who's hit a bump in the road."
3,Left me troubled,"Okay, I've read a lot of Anne Tyler's work. Some I've liked better than others. Saint Maybe being my favorite, but The Accidental Tourist comes a close second. Anyway, I can't quite put my finger on why, but this novel left me irritated and in a foul mood each time I picked it up. The writing is good, the story is easy to follow, the charachters and plot are believable, but...But what? I can't decide, but certainly not my favorite. Maybe it's the fact these people waste the better parts of their lives being miserable.My final vote read somthing else of the author's large body of work."
3,A disagreement,This is appropriate for not only the review of the book but the theme of the book as well. I will agree with other reviewers that it tells the poignant tale of the evolution of marriage over 50 years. And the story was told well but not in an overly captivating manner.Usually I am not so down on a book but I really must have had high expectations for this novel. I just felt so conflicted with the lack of communication with Michael and Pauline. Certainly there is no doubt in my mind that there are couples struggling with the trials of marriage on a daily basis. But the events that Tyler chose to dwell upon and flesh out didn't seem to be the ones that the reader was lead to believe were the most pressing. And there was also a huge sense of unfulfillment with several of the characters at the conclusion of the book.Maybe this book just wasn't for me. I will try reading other titles by this author to see if another of her writing selections piques my interest.
4,Great resource!,"This book is a great resource for the student of the Bible. If you're wanting an introduction into the controversy over the KJV, I'd suggest Cloud's ""8 Myths of Modern Bible Versions"" first.""For Love of the Bible"" is more of a compilation of biographical sketches and quotes (some quite extensive) from those involved on both sides of the issue. What I found really interesting was the inclusion of portions of writings from authors that today are difficult, if not impossible, for the average person to acquire.One thing is for certain: after reading this book, I have much greater respect for the King James Version than I did before. While I've always been partial to it, now I more fully understand why. ""King James Onlyism"" is nothing new, and it certainly isn't the ""off-the-wall"" stance that many of its detractors portray it as."
2,The Worst of The Crow Sequels,"Of course the original Crow is the best,but when it comes to the sequels this is the worst. The only reason I gave it 2 stars not 1 is because it is a Crow Movie. City of Angels should have gone straight to video and Salvation should have gone to theaters. Wicked Prayer is also way better. Watch it if you are a Crow fan though."
5,Great Sequel!!!,"This movie is the best sequel ever. It has everything a movie needs in order to be perfect. Humor, lots of acton, and great costumes, including a sweet plot make this movie a movie that is worth seeing over and over again. Great!"
3,Cool Flick and Decent Transfer,"I greatly enjoyed the first 2 Crow films. Since it seems to be quite difficult to find a region free version of The Crow, I thought I would start with The Crow: City of Angles. As far as the actual movie goes it is not as good as the first. However it does have a decent story which keeps you interested. The ending is a bit of a let down in my opinion, however still a great flick which I am happy to have in my collection.The PQ and AQ are nothing amazing however the PQ was much better than I expected based off of some of the reviews I had been hearing. I was quite impressed with the clarity of such a low budget older film. The detail isn't enough to blow you away, however there are some great closeups of the characters faces which look great.Over-all it is well worth the $10 and fans of the films should not hesitate for a second."
1,Ick.....,"First of all,The Original movie was great but City Of Angels just went too far. Though the The Crow saga itself is Fantasy, This went far beyond the genre. I felt that Vincent Perez wasn't the right choice, he just didn't serve enough justice, and the whole storyline was over-Exaggerated"
2,Hmmmm....I don't think so...,The only good thing about this movie: Iggy Pop. Stick with the Kitchen Sink and Caliber Press comics and the original Brandon Lee movie. They're actually really good. This new stuff that's coming out...ugh. IT'S DISGUSTING!
3,Why does everbody think this movie sucks?,"It's really starting to piss me off that people give this movie such a bad rap. I think that its great! Given, its nowhere near as good as the first one, but the first Crow is just a classic. It can't be beaten. But this movie is still good. Its not near as emotional in the first one. In the first one, you actually felt sorry for the characters, but in City of Angels, the plot is to just kill people. Not like thats a bad thing though. The lighting effects are really cool. Los Angelas is shrouded in a badass looking green fog.Ash and his son are murdered by a gang of thugs after they witness a murder. The crow comes and brings Ash back to ""set the wrong things right""."
1,Bad Sequal to a good movie.,"I was so disappointed when I watched this movie in the theater and I just kept hoping it would end soon. The story line was horrible! For example, Vince Perez tries to be funny when he is not unlike Brandon Lee in the first crow movie who is a bit more comical than Vince. I just hope that if a third crow movie is made, it will be better than this one. Don't waste your money on this movie! The first one is better. NUFF SAID!!"
4,Not for general consumption.,"If you're anticipating gun-toting, kung-fu using, sword-fights-on-rooftops action, you'll be sorely disappointed with this movie. If you're expecting a rich backdrop of urban decay mixed with darkly sumptuous tableaus of personal depravity, you'll get what you came for. The music was adequate, and the scenes of Iggy Pop beating people down were memorable. NB: If you have no clue who Iggy Pop is, you probably won't get the movie."
3,The Crow City of Angels.......different but good..,The Crow we must know is not one person....Every representation is different. Every thing seen through the movie is through the Victims eyes...so all will be different. Expect that. Don't watch a Crow movie after the first unless you welcome change and difference.
3,LJ,This film is okay. It gives you a different atmosphere and feeling of the second coming. But Perez lacks Brandon Lee's magnetism
4,GOOD MOVIE,I FOUND THIS MOVIE TO BE VERY GOOD & THE MUSIC IS GREAT. THIS MOVIE HAS IT'S OWN COOL DARK STYLE.
1,Disgrace of a Memory,"This film is straight up horrid. By creating this film, the memory of Brandon Lee, as well as the reason for writing The Crow in the first place, have both been utterly tarnished. The storyline follows that of the first film - a man is killed horribly along with a loved one, and returns from the dead to exact his revenge. I couldn't even bring myself to pay to see this one. I waited until the local library had it and borrowed it for free. Kids, heed my warning and take the advice of one who has seen this trash...avoid this film no matter whatever else you do in life! Let Brandon Lee retain some dignity, and stay away from this one."
1,"Um, Yeah..",The only thing this pathetic film has in common with the first 'Crow' film is the name - And it insults that name. Stupid plot and stupid acting make it a complete disaster. Avoid this thing.
1,a joke,This movie is a disgrace to the movie name The Crow. They should of stopped after making the first one.
1,The Hollwood sequel factory turns out another terrible movie,"This is easily one of the worst films I've seen in a long time. This movie tries hard to recycle all of the successful elements of the original Crow movie. . .unfortunately it doesn't have much luck. What it lacks in story and acting and basic logic, it tries to make up for with stylish sodium lighting and a hodge-podge of shadowy religious imagery and quick-cut edited kinky S&M orgies. The director fills out the rest of the hour and a half with shots of tattoos, motercycles, and crows flying around the desolate cityscape."
1,A PILE OF CROW CRAP.,"Making a sequel to The Crow is like making a sequel to Grease or Terms of Endearment. We all know what the outcome of that was. The Crow: City of Angels is a disgrace to it's classic prequel. How dare they tarnish the sacred Crow this way? This film lacked everything the first one possessed, even down to the music! Where was all the cool music?!? Let me say that again, WHERE WAS ALL THE COOL MUSIC?!? I was so looking forward to seeing this film and it has to be up there with ""biggest dissapointments in film history"". It's like, ""let's make a sequel to Fargo...yeah, yeah, good idea, yeah.""There's just some things you don't do Hollywood!"
2,I blame the script.,"Director Tim Pope's direction of the film could have been perhaps a bit better, but from a purely visual sense the movie is not without its strong points.Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for the strength of the story itself. It would have been better not to have tied Mia Kirshner's ""Sarah"" character to the that of the first Crow film and the overall strength of the narrative (and especially the dialogue) left much to be desired.And similar to what i said of Tim Pope's direction, i credit the actors for getting as much mileage and investing as much of themselves in the somewhat weak source material that was the script/screenplay for The Crow: City of Angels"
1,Bad Movie,"This movie is low rate with poor plot lines and no character. They ruined Sarah and made this crow lacking in character. The ending was horrible. A lot of the nudity was unnecessary. The few things going for it is the gangsters were at least not cartonishly stupid and the movie's darker setting of depravity and hopelessness was believable. Not worth watching it. It is a shame because the original was so well written, had character was believable."
2,I only saw it because the Power Ranger chick is in the cast.,This movie wasn't all that great. The only good casting I saw were those of Iggy Pop and Thuy Trang. Trang plays the role of Kali; a biker chick/ninjitsu death witch. She played the role of Trini and the yellow ranger in the first series of the Mighy Morphin Power Rangers. She gave her role some justice. Her dialogues were scarce but her appeal was enough. She was the only one who did a decent fight scene with Ashe.
3,"it's not as good as ""The Crow"" (the first one)",it was okay but didn't make a lot of sense. Some of the elements of the movie are completely useless and bore you when you should be paying attention to what the point of the boring stuff is.
2,The Crow: City of Angels... what a waste!,"Why would they want to make a sequel to the best film ever created? The Crow (part 1) was the perfect storyline in which it would have succeeded even if Brandon Lee survived or if the freak accident never had happened. Please don't drag it out anymore than it has to be, it was great to begin with and should have stopped after the first release.Starr*"
2,Shocked And Apalled,"While some parts were good, the movie had a lot of flaws. First of all,the cinematography made everything look yellow. Not only that, there were some scenes you would find in an Anne Rice novel. All in all,disapointting."
1,"Terrible, derivative sequel","This half hearted sequel attempt to the brilliantly moody The Crow is so devoid of any emotion or soul that it still makes me cringe to this day when I watch it just like I did back when it first came out. Vincent Perez plays Ashe; a man resurrected and guided by a crow to avenge his death and the death of his young son. Perez broods his way throughout the film, his wooden acting skills don't let us mourn for him much, same with Mia Kirshner's character Sara (the little girl from the first film now all grown up) and the villians seem like typical card board comic cut outs of typical drug addicted low lifes. In the end, The Crow: City of Angels is a terrible, derivative sequel to the modern day classic original, and would be followed by a direct to video sequel which was a bit better; The Crow: Salvation. The rest of the cast includes Richard Brooks, punk icon Iggy Pop, ex-Power Ranger Thuy Trang, and Thomas Jane who is due to play The Punisher in the upcoming film."
2,2.5 stars. An ok BD if you don't have the old special edition DVD,"Got the Crow 2 BD and was comparing it with my DVD and it really is not that much of an upgrade in PQ. It's slightly sharper then the DVD, but not by much. Sound is DTA-HD MA 2.0 and sounds good, but could have been much better. For $10 bucks it's not to bad if you don't have the special edition DVD, if you have the DVD then just stick with that.One thing I did notice was the BD is not the slightly longer Directors Cut like the old special edition DVD."
2,City of Angels lacks salvation,"While the gothic and gritty image remain intact, the story line is too watered down and fails to connect on an emotional level. Unlike the original Crow, City of Angels just feels flat all around. The culprit here is the stale script and monotonous acting. Though my opinion differs from the vast majority of reviewers, I thought the bright spot of the film was Perez. I thought his manic portrayal of a father returned to avenge his childs death was right on the money. The movie is a bust, but not entirely unbearable."
1,Iggy Pop. Now there's a intimidating villian. HAHAHAHA,"Maybe the movie was good, but I couldn't understand what the Crow guy was saying. It should have been sub-titled. Now, I can't dog this completely. I too, would be running for the hills if I were attacked by Iggy Pop, and the Yellow Ranger. With his freakish girations, and silly squirming. I'm not too sure why the guy was out for revenge. I thought his son died, but you'd never know it by the way the character acted. ""Um, my son is dead, now I want to kill Iggy Pop."" ""I think somebody died, now I want to kill Iggy Pop."". ""Now I want to kill Iggy Pop."". I think he was really seeking revenge for the soundtrack. Now apparently there was a ""MAIN"" villian in this movie too, but I don't remember him. No wait, that's right. He was the guy that wasn't very evil, and died pretty easily. Ooooooh yeah. Now if you'll excuse me I must go seek vengance for being made to suffer through this movie. MUST KILL IGGY POP."
1,Totally wrong,"Okay, you're asking me, ""why did you give a Crow movie a 1?""well, all I can say about it is that it [stunk]. There was one fighting scene, and that really didn't live up to all the ""fighting for justice"" thing that The Crow set for the rest of them. and the follow up, trying to stay in the spotlight of the first was tacky. It was alright, but it really didn't follow the realness of The Crow. I didn't really take to Ash anyway. I could more relate to Eric.There was also the fact of there was a bit too much information when it came to the clubs. And they really didn't have to add some of the things at the end. I didn't like it. [sorry for the spoilers there...]It's not just because I am a major Brandon Lee fan, and I know no one can beat an original, but I know that Vincent Perez was almost there in the whole thing about walking in his shadow and succeeding, but he wasn't quite there.*Shrugs~ so maybe you have a different opinion, but this is mine."
3,Lets Get Everything Straight!,"Ok, the reason everybody has a problem with this movie is, that they believe it tramples on the memory of Brandon Lee because they feel someone else is playing his part. It doesnt, even if he had lived he wouldnt be in this movie. The characters are completely different people for a reason, showing that all kinds of people can come back for vengeance. The problem I had with it is that it was too much like the first, almost trying to copy it(i.e. The similarity of Brandon and Vince's look). I think Salvation did a better job by changing the victims dress, hair, etc.. No movie will ever top the first but, this one tried to, buy using the same formula, long hair, black leather clothes, and a little birdie. Overall it wasnt that bad."
4,"Not as good as the first, but close.","I was worried when I first started watching this, wondering if I wasted my money. Granted it does have just about the same story as the first, except Ash and his son Danny get shot for witnessing a murder instead of in the first they were killed because of Devils Night. Not too far into the movie I realized it was going to be good, they kept the miserable dark look of the city like in the first and Vincent Perez did a worderful job. So if you liked the first Crow I recomend you see City Of Angels, like I said not good as the first but a good follow up."
1,Choose death over this movie!!!!!!,"This has got to be one of the biggest peices of (...) to ever come out. This ""movie"" is the equivalent of being punched (...) by an elephant for 5 straight days. Strongest possible recomondation to avoid. Trust me ""if it only (...), I'd tell you to rent it""."
1,"Hmm, Bad, bad bad. If you liked the crow, DO NOT see this","I loved the crow, it has to be one of my all time favourite films, but city of angels...oh dear. I don't know what they were thinking when they made this film but it can be summed up in one word ""Garbage"". It is nothing compared to the first film, it's bland, uninvolving, the actors cannot act, the script is appauling, the bad guys are un convincing, iggy pop plays some ridiculous character called curve. Everything is lit in green light (whats that about). It runs like an overly long music video. The only thing i felt after watching this film was anger after having paid money for it. Save your money, do not see this film, it's awful and shouldn't have been made. It is a vain attempt to cash in on the success of the first film, only it doesn't becasue it's crap."
1,"If you liked the Crow, don't see this.","This sequel, like most, was a complete disappointment. Vincent Perez cannot act to save his life. The only slightly good thing about this movie was the cinematography. It was dark, but more in a colorful way compared to the first. However that isn't enough to save this waste of a movie. I loved the first one. So to anyone who thinks of seeing this after enjoying the first so much, don't."
3,"MEH, basically the movie on BLu-Ray","Like previous reviews, no extras, very basic menu. The Transfer is actually pretty good. Some of the flaws are noticeable such as specs of dust etc on the film, but nothing really bad. Just expect at least toss in a couple of extras such as the film's trailer, maybe some of the on set interviews that were available on the DvD. So yeah nice to see this unappreciated movie in HD, but yeah."
3,Blu-ray Review,"I really enjoy this movie, but this review is only for the blu-ray release.Packaging: The disc is enclosed in a standard blu-ray keep case. The art on the front and back is well done. The disc itself consists of full color art featuring the crow logo.Video: The picture quality is a significant improvement over the latest DVD release. While far from perfect, it is crisper and the colors are more vibrant. This release also preserves the original theatrical aspect ratio opposed to the DVD release which is 1.85:1. Film imperfections are still visible and some scenes are grainy.Audio: English 2.0. No subs. Disappointing.Special Features: There was a considerable lack of effort put into this release. It is barebones with a below average interactive menu.Overall, I got what I wanted; superior picture quality over the SD DVD. This release almost feels like an add-on opposed to a replacement of the collector's edition DVD."
5,The 2nd...,"Great movie, still not surpassing Crow 1, but great. People should think of this as a story of it's own. It was never meant to replace the first one and no sequel ever will.This film really makes the most honourable sequel to Crow 1. Buy this and watch it. The rest I'll leave to you."
3,A very decent sequel.,Face the facts and realize what the whole crew went through the first Crow film. Brandon Lee was killed on set and on film! Supposedly because of a curse linked with his fathers' past and a myth of the curse of the crow the bird itself. Anyways I can't believe that this came out and I am very surprised. It's not very good but it's also not very bad. Deftones make a cameo in it... remember the deftones...they used to be good. Anyways if you liked the first crow and heard of it's terrible luck with it's history of the making of the film than check this one out. This is one of those movies that are made because The Crow story itself could have been a great franchise but with the main character literally dead and a few dead ringers who just present a thin whit line of what Brandon Lee use to present as the crow this movie is okay but could never have been better than it is!!!
3,Sequel?,"Sequel? Doesn't feel right... If it was going to be a sequel, it should have been directed by the same person. A different director gave the movie a different mood and direction altogether. Don't watch the movie thinking that it's a sequel... I mean... just watch it like it's a movie itself and it will be so much better. Afterall, the title is The Crow: City of Angels, and not The Crow II: whatever."
3,Too much like the first,"Like many have said, this is more of a remake than a sequel. It's also too dark and dirty. Instead of reflecting on the first film, it should have had more of an original story."
1,Was this movie really needed?,"The first is my favorite film of all time. And this must be the worst film of all time. First off I watched it twice. Compared to the original in story feel and emotion it is pathetic. Trying to see it as an individual film it was pathetic. In the first I was compelled and horrified by the emotion and situation. DURING THIS ONE I WAS ACTUALLY NODDING OFF!! There is hardly any character development, if you notice the the main character Alex managed to strike all famous poses of Eric's right down to mirroring the firey crow with a crow shape aparently made of glass?(WHEN DID HE GATHER ALL THAT GLASS never mind) This film was put together for high box office.(RIGHTFULLY BOMBED). Vincent is an excellent actor but should have acted instinctively on his character rather than listen to the director sayng see the first film, then mirror it."
4,give a little credit,"I know I sound kinda stupid, but give Vince a little credit. He made a daring move to take on a roll that was going to be compared to Brandon Lee's Eric Draven. And besides that, I thought it was a good movie. The only reason everybody thinks it sucked is because you expected a movie more like the first, which is impossible. Now, if the movie had come out before the first one, you would probably give the exact rating I am giving it. It was a great film(and the music was awesome as well). And by the way, his accent may have been strong, but I could understand every, single word. It actually added a different twist to the movie which not only was cool, but seperated it from the first, giving it its own idea(which it need given the reviews I read 'it sucked', 'it was baddddddd', 'never want to see it again!' oh, blow it out your ole' wahzoo!!)(and Vincent Perez was AWESOME!!!The only reason you thought he sucked was that he wasn't like and isn't Brandon Lee.)"
2,Poor sequal,"This movie would have been a good movie taken on its own, but as a sequal to The Crow it was terrible. It was essentially a streight re-creation of the orriginal, with only a slightly altered story line. It also lacked the impressive visuals and cinematic creativity of the orriginal. Though the sub-plot involving Sarah was interesting it did little to aleviate the shere repetativeness of this movie.See the orriginal, if your a true crow fan watch this one to."
3,Im giving it 3 stars so maybe is something wrong with me!,"Pros:1. Fresh and new orientation of LOVE element (A love of a father for his son)2. Very very dark feeling, sometimes to dark to my stomach.3. Interesting role for the woman that found the Crow.Cons (Too many of them to list'em all):1. Annoying music after the first 20 - 25 minutes.2. Lame pursuit and ""making justice"" sequences (except one.. you'll know which is it).3. Not much action, just rock & roll, drugs, alcohol, party party and more parties.4. Good performance from the ""good guys"" actors, lame one from the ""bad guys"" (especially from the BIG bad one).Recommendation: Buy it only if you're a die hard crow series fan."
1,I have never been so sourly disapointed,"I love the movie The Crow. When I saw it I knew that I had to get it. It was one of the greatest revenge movies ever made. So of course I was very excited to see the second one in my local video store I could not wait to run out and get it. But the second the star opened his mouth I knew that I was in for a bomb.It is impossible to understand the guy, it sounds like he is talking with food in his mouth, and man was that movie corny. It was the first movie done without any heart. It was incredibly corny and if I could give it a lower rating then one star I would. If this is the only movie in the series that you have seen don't let it stop you from seeing the first one."
3,Second best,"This film makes for a pretty lame sequell to its predocesser The Crow starring Brandon Lee. Though it dose not match up to the first movie it is still a good movie if you are willing not to compare the two. I did enjoy this film and it is defintly worth buying if you are a crwo fan, but be prepared to be sightly dissopointed at first. When you watch it the second time round it is a lot better, you have recoverd from the inital dissipointmant are can appretiat the film for what it is. Vinccent Prez is not the best person to play Ashe in my opinion and his acsent is sometime hard to understand. all in all this is a good film but is not the original!"
5,A must have for any Joyce Fan,"James Joyce's work speaks for itself - albeit often in long, convoluted sentences - and therefore, a review of his collected work does not begin to do the thousands of pages found in this collection justice. This is truly a must-have for any Joyce fan.This collection can prove to be particularly valuable to the thousands of office drones out there (like myself) who do not have the courage to pick up a book during working hours, for fear that their bosses may reprimand them for 'wasting company time.' Now you can read Joyce's work on your computer screen at work. You may go blind doing so because of the radiation, but it is better than losing your eyesight by reading spreadsheets all day."
2,A Treasure Of A Friend,"This book was advertized as new. I purchased it as a gift. However, much to my chagrin, upon opening it, I sawon the dedication page a book plate glued over the designated lines. Thus, the need to return."
3,Weak build quality Charger,"I received the products in a US Postal Service box. The items worked fine out of the box but looked increadibly cheap and light. Unfortunately, the Wall Charger didn't last long, lasting all of 5 minutes. I noticed some kind of spark and it died. Am just glad that my Zen Vision M wasn't damaged out of it.As for the car charger, it still works. The A/V cable is the only thing I'm really happy about with the package. It seems sturdy with thick cables.I would recommend the A/V cable and probably the car charger but not the wall charger."
3,2 outta 3,The chargers work just fine. As for the AV cable - only the audio worked - i could not get the video to work on either of my TVs.
4,Magazine's swan song pointed to a new direction.,"Magazine's final studio album,released in 1981,veered towards a new musical direction.After John McGeoch left for the greener pastures of the Banshees,Robin Simon,then Ben Mandelson stepped in to fulfill guitar duties.This album,featuring Mandelson,took us into various musical styles ranging from Motown (""About the weather"")to disco (""The garden"").The rest of the album sneaked us a peek into Howard Devoto's musical future.Compared to other Magazine albums,this is lighter. One can imagine what would have happened had Devoto, Barry Adamson, Dave Formula and John Doyle stuck it out."
4,Magazine's last stand,"This was Magazine's final album, and has been criticised by some for lacking the spiky, punky attitude of the previous ones. However, with this album we see a more introspective, less negative side to Howard Devoto's lyrics. Likewise, the music has become far more gentle and melodic, whilst still punctuated by the inventive bass lines of Barry Adamson.The group had, by this point, lost guitarist John McGeoch to Siouxsie and the Banshees, and this no doubt accounts for the band's change in musical direction. Personal highlights have to be the magnificent 'Vigilance', which has brought a tear to the eye on occasions, 'The great man's secrets' and album-closer 'The garden'. A great album from an underrated band."
5,LOVE this movie!!!,LOVE Camp Nowhere and the DVD itself worked awesomely! I have never heard of the other two movies on the DVD and have yet to watch either of them also.
4,great teutonic 80s synth rock,"By the way, the diffinitive version of ""Der Kommissar is on this LP. The After The Fire version is weak and gutless by comparsion; the version here has all the euro-trashy grit of a Berlin metro in it. Very appealing. There are other rock-disco songs on this LP, as well as some different types of 80s rock. The whole LP is mainly rap-sung in German by the maestro Falco himself."
1,Drivers Side Piece Broke in Cold Weather,"Installed in Jan and by end of Feb the drivers side piece had a huge crack in it. Not sure when or why it happened, but it was too late to return. I believe it broke when we had a cold spell. I only purchased this item because of the reviews I read from this site. The other shades for the other windows seem to be holding up fine. Wish there was a way to contact the product maker instead of just amazon."
2,CHEAP,"they are cheap flimsy, my driver side one cracked already after about 3 weeks after putting it on, they would look better if the tape that holds them in would disappear, but some sticks out. Get something better not these."
4,Beginners Only,"It is quite an OK book for beginners.I was disappointed with it because the tools he uses can be seen in Daily comic strips. So I don't think Mort Walker researched Worldwide comics. The examples are Limited not vast as you would expect in a ""Lexicon"".Also it doesnot go into details about Technique and only gives you bare essentials. Will Eisner's Comics & Sequential Art is a better book for beginners and professionals alike.You could finish reading Lexicon in a day and start drawing your own strip immediately. Recommended as a Quick Fix."
4,Some Mounting Tips,"This is an awesome mount nothing I have seen compares.However it does require some work to be successful. First ,you will need to add structure to the ceiling where the mount is to be placed (i.e. cross rafters, stud sandwich plates, header plate or whatever to insure the unit is firmly and safely attached to the ceiling.The only negative I found is that the mount is not vertically adjustable and this will not meet everyone's expectations. You may not have a problem with the fixed drop distance for your situation. I did and I solved the problem by replacing the shipped drop arm with a 1 and 1/2"" x 12"" pipe from the local hardware (you could take the drop arm to the hardware have it cut to the correct length and have them re-thread the pipe). Thus the top of my 47"" Sony LCD mounted 8"" from the ceiling and not the approximate 24"" that the shipped arm would have given me."
3,Problems with XP and Firewire,"First, the good news. The drive seems to work well when I use the USB cable and I haven't had any problems with the fingerprint scanner.Now the bad news. The drive doesn't seem to work with Firewire on computers running XP. I have tried to use this drive with Firewire on multiple PCs running XP, with multiple different Firewire cables. I exchanged my first drive for a new one through Amazon, and tried again, to no avail.I contacted Lacie customer service to try to hash out the problem. I'd give them a B+ for effort, D for results.Bottom line, if you run XP and plan to use this with Firewire, think again. But USB seems to work OK."
2,Failed after 11 months,"I was happy with this when I first bought it. The fingerprint recognition was shaky at times, but I was never unable to gain access.However, the hard drive failed after 11 months. I would not recommend this hard drive for that reason."
2,Security issues and a big hiccup in the interface.,"This was a great solution to my backup security worries, but to make this drive work with my PPC G5 Mac, I have to reboot after the drive is unlocked, or it's slow, slow, slow (spinning beach ball pauses of 30-40 seconds before every action.) The fact that the drive remains unlocked after a reboot--or for that matter, after a shutdown--is a security issue, and I could live with that, but the reboot would be a big hassle if I was using this drive every day. Oh, and if you're thinking of using the drive on a shared machine, be sure to lock it when you're done, because it will show up unlocked no matter what account you use. I know!!!! No response to e-mails to LaCie looking for relief. I like LaCie drives. I've had several and nary a single problem until now. I surely wish they'd answer."
5,C.S.I. Miami is the ultimate C.S.I.,"What more can I say, it's the best of the best, Horatio is...well no words to describe him and the rest of the team is awesome!"
1,WHAT HAPPENED??,"CSI Miami used to be my favorite show until it seemed to jump the shark in the 4th season with utterly ridiculous plot twists (Marisol & Horatio for example) But Season 5 really knocked the shark into oblivion with its overly produced scenes where the camera work seems to have upstaged the humanity of the key players. Cheesy writing, bad plots, maudlin twists have taken what was once a vibrant spin off to a great franchise and made it a caricature. Stop with all the fancy foot work and bring back some of the original and more grounded flavor"
3,TV Series review,The serires should have stoped after 3 or 4 seasons. It does not have the content that keeps the orginal CSI program interesting.
2,One of the Worst TV Series,This is one of the worst TV series. All the casts are just either wooden actors or just over the top. I don't know how anyone would love this show.
1,Not worth a cent,"Please read Jimmy's review (the one star one) before even considering watching or buying this series. I am a huge fan on all CSI series since their creation and this is the worst one by far.It is insulting our intelligence with stories lacking any credibility and Horatio Cayne is turning into an unbearable ""White Knight"" born to save the world and hardly ever looking at any evidence in the lab. I understand that CSI was lacking some personal angles and too focused on the cases but now it is the opposite, too much personal stories and boring cases.I cannot believe this series is the most watched in the world when CSI Las Vegas, CSI NY, The Wire or the last seasons on the English series Waking the Dead are by far much smarter and enjoyable."
4,CSI Miami - Fifth Season,"I'm still working on season 4, but I'm sure I'll like this one as well. It's a great show. I wouldhave bought the whole series, but a little over my budget."
3,Good,"I like the show ok, but I could do without the music. The original CSI or the NY CSI is better."
3,More Eclectic Than The Name Suggests ...,"Upon seeing the title ""Krishna Beats"" on a CD sitting in the House / Ambient section of the music store, you might be tempted to think this will be ""Cafe Del Mar, Indian Style."" Well, a few songs on these two discs could be described that way, but most could not. Instead, what you get is a more eclectic, world-beat type of ambience, with Celctic pipes, Portuguese spoken word, and Jamaican semi-rap sharing space with the more eastern-sounding stuff. Behind all of it are cool vibes and slow house beats. Overall the album is a good listen, although somewhat experimental and hodgepodge, and not quite as tight or consistent as some better collections in this genre. Nevertheless, if you're the kind of person who likes chill-out music and also happens to have travel posters all over your room, then this is the collection for you. Just don't expect two hours of techno sitar."
5,Don't let the samples fool you.,"What a shame there has been only one review for this album, based purely on the samples. It would seem only fair that a reviewer should listen to the actual CD before panning it. I am glad I ignored the advice and ordered this lovely recording."
1,"Scratching, popping, and hissing","If the samples are any indicator, these recordings should have been remastered before commercial release. Ouch!"
2,just not worth the money,"Although this is a beautiful looking book, the content is poorly laid out and confusing. That might be because, as claimed, its not a real tour guide (like Frommer's, etc.). My question after reading it is, what exactly is this book and what is the author attempting to achieve. All the information is readily available online, and there simply isn't enough here to either recommend it or to even pick it up and read it for a second time!! The information just isnt unique enough and the lay out is confusing. I'd say stick to the traditional guide books."
1,Gave me a headache,"A lot of interesting and useful stories, recommendations and information in this book. The organization of this book impairs the value of all this. It's definitely NOT a guidebook, although it offers information and perspective that many readers would like to have in a guidebook. The author/compiler has managed to make it difficult for her readers to locate, excavate and return to the material that she compiles. It may be clever, but it's also a taxing jumble."
1,Dreadful guide book,"Badly organized, can't find anything quickly...most of the tips can be found in lonely guide for the various counries....in the end was totally useless on our trip to cambodia, laos, and vietnam..."
1,No help at all.,"I also bought this book because of high praise here. After going through it several times, I am forced to conclude that it has been of no help at all in planning my visit to SE Asia."
5,A must have for your travel book library,"As someone who's outgrown Lonely Planet and Let's Go guides, I found Fay's book to be an excellent guide for those looking for more in-depth perspective and history than simply finding a hostel or looking for the next watering hole. Pictures are gorgeous and one can easily tell a good deal of money went into the exquisite design. A great writer and guide, Kim is someone I wish I had along with me in my South East Asian travels!"
2,Lack of logic in book's structure,"I'm disapointed with this book. The information provided is interesting but the way the book is structured is very strange. I can't see any logic there. It would make sense if a chapter (each chapter has a theme) had a section for each of the countries. But no. Eg. you go to chapter on shopping and you have one page of info about Thailand, than a page about Laos, Thailand again, Cambodia, Laos again etc. Very weird.... It makes the book difficult for me to read and stick to...."
2,Not Worth My Time.,"This play is depressing, sad, and meaningless. I enjoyed reading it for the style in which it is written (the play progresses backward) and some of the staging techniques are rather interesting. The theme of the play boils down to that the most precious moments in our lives are the one we don't even realize. That theme is an important one, but is overused so much it has lost much of it's impact. Still, when used correctly, it's a profound and ephipanical message. However, when used as it often is, such as in TIME OF MY LIFE, it feels pasted on and fake. Read the play if you wish, but it's really not worth the time."
5,see what I'm sayin,"Finally, a CD where you can understand the words! These guys are great - the vocals are top notch, the instrumentals terrific, and the original music is outstanding (remember you can understand the words). For the price, this is a CD that everybody that enjoys soft rock (mostly) should have in their library."
3,Kindle version inferior,Wonderful stories but the kindle version is so riddled with typos that it really spoils one's reading experience. Buy this book in paperback rather.
5,The original and still the best,"You can't beat the early Rumpole stories. My old paperback of ""Rumpole of the Bailey,"" the first of the books collected in this omnibus edition, had grown so tattered and worn through reading and re-reading that I needed a fresh copy. And the omnibus gives you the two subsequent Rumpole books as well. These early stories really establish all the character traits that make Horace such an unforgettable character, his fearlessness before the bar, his inability to stand up to his wife, his love for small cigars and cheap red wine - Chateau Thames Embankment. The later stories - like those in Omnibus Three, especially -- can sometimes seem flat and tired but here, you get Rumpole in top form. I'm sure I'll read this one to tatters soon enough. Long live Rumpole!"
4,Guaranteed laughs,"Whether you are an old Rumpole fan, or are picking this book up for the first time, I guarantee you will not be disappointed. Rumpole is a crusader for the poor, the downtrodden and the hopelessly defenseless. His motivations for defending the poor and downtrodden may not be admirable (funding his claret drinking), nor his methods sound (pulling at the heartstrings of the jury rather than legal prowess), but one thing that you can't say about this less than mediocre lawyer is that he isn't exceptional :/I may not agree with all of Mortimer's earthly moralizing, but I do appreciate his humor. Read this book for a good laugh."
3,2nd disc Defective,"As the other customer said the 2nd DVD is defective, I had the same problem, I got it in different store (WM) and I also had to return the first, and second set, because seems like doesn't matter were you buy it is going to be defective."
1,defective video,"I bought this item in a store. As the other reviews have said the second disc does not play. I tried playing the files on my computer directly (assuming there was an error with the menu), and they were corrupted. Pixelated, bad sound, skipping... there needs to be a re-issue. You will only get half of the episodes that you purchase.update: I emailed the manufacturer and they sent me a replacement set which actually works... if you buy it now it should not be defective anymore. If you have a defective copy I recommend you ask for a replacement to be mailed to you."
1,2nd Shipped Defective Disc,"I was so excited when I saw this available since I have been waiting for this for years!! I received the first copy and the second disc would not work in any of my DVD players and appeared to be formatted incorrectly! I requested a replacement since I really wanted a good copy of this and once again I was sent a defective copy. Perhaps that is why Amazon is not offering it except through other shippers now. I have a feeling something went horribly wrong in producing these and the entire shipment was bad. If you order this item, please make sure that you immediately check Disc 2 on receiving it to see if it works. I still want this DVD, but not if it is defective. It is such a total pain to have to return something twice."
2,It would be perfect if the second disc worked!!!,"Well I am a huge fan of Fractured Fairy Tales! I had some on video, I bought the best of on DVD and now in 2012, the complete series is offered with a BOGUS SECOND DISC THAT WILL NOT PLAY MATERIAL, BUT HAS A MENUE!I do not understand how they could make a huge error by not checking before selling this to people! I hope they fix this problem, because disc one is awesome! My daughters love Fractured Fairy Tales!"
1,WARNING: Disc 2 is Defective!,"I have purchased Fractured Fairy Tales twice since its release date. Both times, Disc 2 would not play regardless of whether I chose ""Play All"" or ""Episode Selection."" After each purchase, I had to request a refund which is a waste of my time and a waste of the retailer's resources. What happened to quality control? It is a disgrace Classic Media hasn't issued a recall of their defective product. Apparently, Classic Media hopes you will purchase their defective junk and not watch the DVD until after the refund/return period has elapsed. Shame on them."
4,A warm and funny picture of a boy's life in pre-WWI America.,"A warm and very funny picture of small town boy's life in pre-World War One America. It's told in a series of episodes that center around the two twelve year old or so boys of the title. It's not really a boy's book, despite its reputation. Tarkington's very interested in the psychology of Penrod's family as well as in the ways that kids relate to each other -- but it's all played for laughs. Also a clear picture of the mores of small-town America at a time when homes still had carriage houses in the back -- but no carriages or horses."
2,Goodbye and Good Riddance (My reassessment after re-reading),"I loved this book when I read it as a kid, and recently got the opportunity to re-read it. I was shocked to see how racist it is. So much so that I was embarrassed that I didn't pick that up when I read it the first time.I realize that the book is reflecting some commonly held beliefs of the time, but its more racist in my opinion then other books you can read from that time period or earlier.I'd recommend reading this only for its historical value to gain insight into the early 20th century. But for children's/juvenile we can do much better."
4,PB's dreams,"PB had played with Gary Thomas, and had Joey deFrancesco in his previous albums. As such, his style is grounded in traditional bebop to soul, but also venture into the ""out"", sometime incorporating fusion ala john mclaughlin. but in this album he chose to be in a trio setting, supported by ray drummond and jeff tain watts. thus it's more traditional setting. the tunes chosen are mostly in moderate tempo and after a while can be difficult to concentrate on ... maybe the title 'dreams' ?anyway, this is a solid outing. PB plucks the string in confident manner, and the record quality is good. you can hear the guitar sound loud and clear though still in traditional jazzbox tone, unlike some of bebop guitarists whose sound can be buried in the mix."
4,Raw talent,"Aww, Memories. Great Heavy hitting sounds with funky lyrics. The sound quality isn't the best but I think that's what makes the album. Raw beats and guitar sounds. Good example of Portland music in mid 90's. If you don't like it the first listen keep listening it definately grows on you."
1,Does NOT work on computer monitor,"I bought this new off Ebay to use as a computer with my 24"" Sony monitor only to find it only works off a TV. I'm sadly disappointed to find out I can not use it this way. Now I have to resell it on Ebay and take the loss.I thought this should be noted for those who want to use it for anything other than a entertainment device for their TV."
2,Changer is poor design,"I bought 3 of the changers to go with this system, If you load it up (200 disks) eventually (3-4 months) the stepping motor will die.Between the 3 of them I've had them in service 6 times in less than one year. The service guys are good and the warrentee covers it however after my year is up then what. I guess I could buy the 1 yr extended warrentee Sony keeps offering me for $200.00 per unit (ya right!)Sony has a lot of work to do in QA and test IMO"
3,good product bad publicity,"the item was not as the picture, it didnt have any paded for better handling, it was sold by unit, not as a pair like it looks on the picture, the ought to change the picture, besides that it does the job quite well, happy with the product not the company that made the publicity or sell it because they sold me and all version without the plastic pading"
4,Big help,"My son helped me relocate. This was a big help to assure safe and damage free loading, transport. Strong and durable."
1,Do not buy,"I am sorry...I loved ABBA...I loved Agnetha but please, oh please do not buy this CD it is just horrible..not even my dad would enjoy it. C-class songs charged almost $42.00 bucks :(( This is not ABBA, this is not Agnetha or Frida or Benny or Bjoern...This is cheap marketing..so Do NOT BUY IT...it sucks..."
4,AGNETHA FALTSKOG selected her favourite songs,"ABBA's Agnetha selected her personal favourite songs. Songs recorded before, with and after ABBA. She was a big star in Scandinavia before joining the group in 1972. She sung in Swedish and scored many hits in her native country. After ABBA she recorded her songs in English and also did well in the charts selling more than four millions records on her own. This collection, focusses on her pre-ABBA period. All songs are well sung and charmingly written. Agnetha composed the mere part of the material. And she did it well. This collection is the perfect gift for the Agnetha and ABBA fan, but as it includes many Swedish songs it will miss the appeal for the rest of the world, which is a shame, because it showcases the best recordings of one of the most interesting voices of the seventies and eighties."
4,a peek at a pre-abba agnetha,"for those who are hoping that there'd be new recordings in this package,well literally,there is:a spoken word ""introduction"" in swedish.the letdown notwithstanding these tracks show how agnetha was before she pacted w/a group that some agruably say,changed the face of pop music.a pleasant surprise for the novice is the fact that a bulk of the material is written and produced by agnetha herself.her first single jag var kar ( i was so in love) would remind you of her idol,connie francis.making an appearance in this collection are her two kids singing one track w/her each."
3,Cute Baby Laptop,"I got this for my (11 months old at the time) daughter for Christmas. It is great for a small baby. Mine wasn't very durable, though. She really didn't play with it that much and the star easily came off. The star also came off of the little earth pouch. The rocket makes a cool rocket sound but it stopped working soon after it was opened. Other than these few complaints it is a cute toy and I think good for a first play laptop for babies. I also paid much less than the current almost $20 listed price. I wouldn't pay $20 for it, and after the problems really the $12 I paid for it wasn't really worth it. But, maybe it was just a flaw with mine. Still a neat toy."
2,Not what I was expecting...,"Not that great of product. Flimsy and not very entertaining. Makes cool sounds, but one broke after only a few weeks of use. Doesn't come close at all to adult laptop for child to even think it was like her parent's. Not worth the price. Should be about $10 cheaper."
1,Extremely Disappointed,"We are extremely disappointed with this toy. We purchased it for our 23-month-old, because she never lets us use our computer when she is around. We thought it would distract her while we type on the real computer. There are no buttons that light up, and it doesn't even have a real screen. It's all made out of foam. The only component she even pays attention to is the rocket. Classifying this as suitable for children up to three years old borders on intentional false advertising. It might keep a one-year-old entertained for five minutes if you're lucky."
1,not interesting enough,this laptop doesn't make enough sounds.just the spaceship and orange button have some sort of sound.most components of the laptop was easily detached by my son who is 8mths and were easily misplaced.he lost interest the same day i bought it!
3,not cute,i didnt think this toy would be so weak. It made so noise. I thought it would be so type of laptop
1,DANGEROUS!!,"Please, save your money!! There are some very small pieces that baby can easily choke!!! I bought for my 4 months old baby and she didn't enjoy at all. Besides, I left her alone and she had some parts in her mouth, it is very dangerous! If you want to buy their first computer, go ahead and get a leap frog or fisher price, they like them better!"
4,Souvenirs de l'Occupation,"Paris pendant la Seconde Guerre Mondiale, la période de l'Occupation. Le narrateur est tiraillé par la question qui court à travers tout le roman: tre tratre ou non? Le narrateur accepte d'abord de travailler pour la Gestapo franaise et en mme temps, au hasard d'une rencontre, se retrouve membre d'un réseau de la Résistance, le RCO - Réseau des Chevaliers de l'Ombre. D'un caractère hésitant, le narrateur ne se sent appartenir à aucun des deux camps, ni tratre ni héros, seulement martyre.Comme dans ""La Place de l'Etoile"", son premier roman, l'auteur a choisi pour son deuxième roman l'époque de l'Occupation, une époque qu'il n'a pas vécue mais dont les derniers remous l'ont atteint."
1,Do not buy this!,"This guide is horrible! Okay, the walkthrough is decent, but who needs a walkthrough for this game? Seriously... this game is very straightforward. The best reason to get a guide for it is for weapon, item, and monster lists. This book is very incomplete. While there are at least a hundred new weapons and pieces of armor, this book only lists about fifteen. The monster lists are also very bad, many monsters are missing, and for the ones that ARE listed, the items they drop are not. Bradygames posted updated weapon/armor lists on their website, but they are still missing all of the rare weapons in the game as well as the monster info. A very rushed book, not worth your cash. You're better off just finding a FAQ online."
4,A story that must be told. Fascinating!,"Some may be critical of the grammar and spelling in this book. Forget that, it may fail in the editing but it is a story that people must read. if you do, you will not put it down. It is a great read and will make you very angry. Lisa Piel needs to be cleared. The injustice done to her is too great to ignore. I hope more read this and people demand that Lisa Piel's name be finally cleared."
4,Enlightening,"I live in another community in NW lower Michigan, but nothing I read in this book surprised me. A litany of the incompetence and technological ignorance of small town police forensics. A shooting death and not a fingerprint lifted! Excellent story interestingly presented (and the proof reader is hopefully employed at another pursuit at this time!)"
1,Who proofread this book?,"Someone should be embarrassed; grammatical errors, misspells, typos, names not capitalized. Not well put together, jumps around a lot. Sure, it puts to light a different way to view public figures in Petoskey, but someone needed to take more time in making it more readable."
4,Interesting and hard to put down,"It give some insight as to how women are still discriminated against in certain jobs that are still classified as a ""man's job""."
2,Not Choir Music!,"Briefly, I agree with the French review by Ron Roy - reverberous! But it's the choral reverb, not the recording ambience. I'd forgotten I had this CD, having played it once and stashed it, but I took it out and iPodded it, and now I recall that I never got past the third track. The Oxford Camerata is a fine English choir, but no choir could individuate the lines of Gesualdo's polyphony with enough mordant independence of diction and musical syntax, let alone 'nail' the perfect tuning required of cadential chords.On the other hand, I can't recommend an alternative. Gesualdo has not been well performed, perhaps because his work falls between the realms of the Orlando Consort for Renaissance and Europa Galante for Baroque, to go straight for the best. Too bad!"
3,Not Free SF Reader,"Another lone man against a conspiracy, this time one of the criminal kind.This time the setting is academic, and the law enforcement types choose a university guy to be their undercover man. A bit of a stretch, perhaps, but that won't stop Ludlum from inflicting lots of crazy stuff on his normal bloke becoming a heroic action figure."
1,A great name doesn't always mean a great book,"Who never heard Ludlum's name? He has big name among thriller authors. This fact was intriguing me to read his books too. ""The Matlock Paper"" was Ludlum's second book I've ever read beside ""The Gemini Contender"". And I still can't make Ludlum's books as my cup of tea.I bought this book with great expectation that Ludlum would write ""bettter"" then Frederick Forsyth (which I've read all of his books) and Tom Clancy. However, I was very disappointed to find that the topic and plot were too simple, especially compared with Ludlum's big name. The story was predictable and not thrilling at all.I am not sure whether I will give another try for another Ludlum's books. I'm simply too disappointed with this one."
5,A Good Book!,"After reading other reviews I didn't know if I wanted to read this book or not. I am now glad that I did. Professor James Matlock is chosen by the Justice Department to infiltrate a crime ring that is operating on the East Coast. This ring is very able being active in the world of drugs,prostitution,and gambling.Our hero has to go undercover at the risk of his own life. During his time undercover he discovers that the crime ring is far reaching and very powerful. By sheer luck Matlock survives several attempts on his life. The final ending of this book will also prove to be a shocker. Buy this book. It is a very good read."
5,Beautiful Pastoral Symphony,"Naxos has produced a vibrant recording in the form of two Vaughan Williams Symphonies - No. 3 and No. 6. To start, the sixth symphony on this CD sounds great, and is a testimony to Vaughan Williams more dissonant style. In complete contrast is the third, or ""Pastoral,"" symphony. It is here where the orchestra really impresses. The strings are very well-balanced and stunning with their timbres and nuances. Delicate woodwinds accompany the strings, along with distant brass. Overall, this recording truly manifests itself on every level of Vaughan Williams musical purposes. The program of both these symphonies on one disc displays musical contrast, an excellent notion when it comes to discovering a composer's different styles. Overall, this album is highly recommended both on an artistic level and a production level."
4,a sleek accessory,"This Tv stand is very nice, but there are few short comings. First of all it looks great with the right TV on it. It has all the solidarity of a sony product, and even incorporates a belt to ""srtap"" the front heavy TV into place. The stand took me about 30 minutes to put together, and it's HEAVY! So get help, also take a minute and measure the size of any components you wish to put inside. The space is small, but a reciever will fit if you leave the galss doors off of it. It doesn't look bad without the doors, but be prepared to lose that finished look if you want your elecrtonics placed under the TV. If you intend to assemble it yourself, you should not have too much of a problem. GET HELP when you are ready to move it, and when you are ready to set the monsterously heavy TV into place."
3,Very brief.,"I was a little disappointed by this book. The subtitle says ""The Stories Behind Your Favorite Christmas Carols"". However, these tales are so short they really aren't stories and are mere ancedotes. There are a few interesting facts one can learn, but for the most part this book is a let down because it doesn't live up to it's title."
3,Bit of a let down....,"I was disappointed with this book. I have read the authors' biography of Dracula, and found little new or worthwhile presented here. Moreover, the title is deceptive. Very little of this book is devoted to the history of vampires, and too much of it deals with modern popular culture. Given that the authors are serious scholars, I was hoping for a detailed look at popular culture roughly at the time of Vlad Tepes. I highly recommend the authors' other book, ""Dracula: Prince of Many Faces,"" but find little merit in this volume. I think this book might have more appeal to a general audience. So, if you are looking for some basic background on the ""real"" Dracula (Vlad Tepes), and the basics of how he fits into folklore and popular culture, then this book may very well be for you. It is well written, and draws on the authors' considerable knowledge. It just was not what I expected or hoped for."
3,"Fairly thorough, but aged","In Search of Dracula turned out to be a fairly informative source regarding Vlad Tepes, and all of the stories surrounding him. The authors certainly did their homework to the best of their abilities at the time, though I wonder if anything else has been discovered in the past 40 years or so. The chapters regarding filmography and all of the fictional books that have been written about Dracula and vampires in general, I found rather boring, though others may find them useful. I simply wasn't interested in those aspects. I found the stories regarding his actions (both as a blood-thirsty monster and as a strict, but fair ruler) to be very interesting."
2,Reading with Tequila,A really disappointing read. I had assumed that the book would give a little bit of Vlad the Impaler's background and then focus on vampire history. It was like reading a history text on Romania and its battles with the Turks. Not at all what I was lead to believe it would be. It did give some limited vampire information once we got past the chapters and sub-chapters of the real Dracula.
4,AN ESSENCIAL GUIDE OF VAMPIRES,"I THINK THIS BOOK IS VERY NECCESSARY IF YOU WANT TO KNOW EVERY THING ABOUT THE HISTORY OF DRACULA AND VAMPIRES, AS TO KNOW THE TRADICIONAL FOLK OF THE PEOPLE FROM ROMANIA.THE BOOK IS VERY EASY TO READ, AND YOU CAN HAVE A GOOD TIME IF YOU LOVE VAMPIRE STORIES."
5,Gift,I purchased this book as a gift. The book arrived a timely manner and in good condition. I bought this book based on a program I saw on the History Channel and with knowledge that the author has family history with Dracula.
3,Information/clarification,"This is the OST 1(/3) from the Video series -- NOT the TV Series.This came 'first' then a TV series was produced with music by Kaoru Wada (or Wada Kaoru?!) ... same composer who did TONS of music for Inuyasha, and manyother series.Not sure who this one is by..."
2,Looking for something?....,"If you're interested in this cd, it may mean several things.1-You're into J pop...can't help you there.2- You enjoy anime soundtracks- I'd reccomend Yoko Kano's work instead. Try Escaflowne, Cowboy Bebop, and if you like those move on to Macross Plus, Brained Powered, and Turn A Gundam.3-You like soundtracks in general. Well, the above still apply, but why not check out some John Willaims or Hans Zimmer?4-You(like I was)are interested or are looking for something in the vein of classical music- Well, if you're new to classical,get a guide, like ""The Complete Idiots Guide to Classical Music""(not that I'm calling you an idiot -_-), then try some Bach, Mozart, or Beethoven. One of them will suit you're fancy,believe me, or perhaps all three.5- You just want your Record of Lodoss War Soundtrack, so stop babbling about Hans Zimmer and classical music, yah freak!.....okay, suit yourself, but you could do much better then this. Fair warning."
3,Playing the Game of War,"A guys-on-a-mission book with a twist: the ""guys"" are a bunch of little kids!Michael Avallone was an incredibly prolific writer who did a ton of novelizations and he delivers hack writing that is easily digestible and fun. The weaknesses of the book are in fact due to the cliched nature of the script, but the author does a deft job of translating it to the page."
2,incompatible with other LaCie drives,This new LaCie 500 external does not work daisy chained nor separately connected to computer with other drives. tech support could not assist in the alloted tech support time. should have gone with another brand.
1,Dead After 1 Year,"This was a great drive for about 1 month. I used it for one project and saved the files to it. One year later, I plug it in and its dead. The blue light barely lights up and the drive does not mount. I wouldn't recommend this drive. In my experience...and I have heard from others, the LaCie drives will stop working for no reason at all after sitting on a shelf. Not very reliable as a data storage device. I cannot believe I spent over $200 and it does not work. Who is designing these things?"
1,Worked for one year and died with my backup in it,I bought this drive in November 2007 and used it as my Time Machine drive since then. It died two days ago. Lasted less than the internal drive in my Mac. I guess that is not a good sign for a backup drive...
1,Problem with Fan,I have used this hard disk for about 1 year now. I mostly use it as a backup for my macbook and in 1 year i already stopped working twice. Both time i have to send it back to manufacturer and they return it in like 3 weeks but it broke again. Both time when it stopped working it started making loud noise. I assume that noise is because of fan not working properly. I never even moved this hard disk from its place and never once knocked over or dropped. I am so fed up with this disk is that now i am thinking of buying a new 1 TB hard disk and throwing this one away
1,Did Not Last Long,"I have a LaCie 250 gig version, and it died after only a couple of years of moderate use, losing all data. Because the unit was beyond its one year warranty, LaCie would not look at it (even for a fee). Needless to say, I am no longer a customer."
3,"Good product, but don't purchase online...","I bought this external hard drive from Amazon thinking it's easier to buy online. When I received the hard drive it had obviously been opened before. I had ordered a brand new one, not used! The plastic was ripped and the CD packets were broken. AND THEN- I went to install it, and it turns out it still had information on it from the past owner! I'm not super computer saavy, and it took hours before my computer friend could figure out what was wrong with it and how to rid the hard drive of whatever was left on it. It's was extremely frustrating. I recommend getting yours from the store."
4,"Great drive, but Firewire quit on one of mine.","I own two of these drives, and I'll probably own more.I deduct a star because the firewire quit working on one drive after a week. I kept it because the USB still worked (don't know about the eSATA), and it was too much trouble to return. My second one has been working fine with FW800 for a while now. Maybe I should count off more than a star for a product failure, but if this is the only time, then I love this drive.I like the FW800 for connecting to my Mac Pro. I like the form factor and the system for mounting multiple drives in a stack. I love the idea of creating an eSATA RAID, but I haven't done it yet. It seems like a great price for all those options."
5,Excellent Product!,"LaCie makes great hard drives and has been doing so for a long time. My first LaCie I bought in 1990 it was an 80MB drive and it still works as well as when it was new. Luckily it is still attached to the original Mac. This is my second LaCie in this form factor, I have Quadra 320 that I use with my laptop, and both have worked well. The only thing that has been disappointing is that the 320 shuts down completely when I turn off the laptop and the 500, which is attached to a MacPro does not. Customer support indicated that it was because the MacPro's power level when it is off, never drops off completely. I highly recommend the Quadra series!"
5,perfect storage for video editing,"This hard drive is perfect storage for my video editing/clips. The FireWire 800 speed, and the amount of disk space make life easy."
2,This is ok if you have all new gear,"It's a good hard drive, I only wish it had 2 fireWire 400 ports.I can't conect another hard drive to it (my other ones are 400, not 800 and as most of us know USB takes forever !)I hope this helps someone..."
1,Malfunction after 1 Year,"Product worked great for 1 year and inexplicably the HD failed and no longer works. As an IT person, I've tried everything (swapping out cables, power and even tried connecting the device to my laptop and backup PC). It was good while it lasted. Now I've lost 100GB of data. If you plan on buying, please remember to backup your LaCie HD."
4,Great product!,"I bought this drive at the first sign of trouble with my laptop. I backed up the data on Saturday and my laptop's hard drive crashed on Sunday. Great timing.This is my 4th LaCie drive, and they have all worked without any issues.For those that have experienced their LaCie drives crashing, I wouldn't say it's not impossible, but it isn't typical, either.My only problem with the drive is the price. Comparable drives are less expensive, yet LaCie continues to charge what I consider to be a little more than they should.If you can afford it, you probably won't do much better for a solid (heavy) external drive."
1,Huge hassle to install on Windows VIsta,"Do NOT buy this product if you're using Windows Vista. Vista doesn't come with drivers for this product and Lacie doesn't provide them anywhere on their website.Furthermore, Lacie's tech support is virtually worthless. When I called, the recording first said ""4 call ahead of you."" After holding for 15 minutes it said ""6 calls ahead of you."" How that's posible I don't know, but it shows an inefficient customer service structure. I waited 10 more minutes and then hung up.Still don't have my drive connected. A very frustrating experience."
4,"So far, so good","I bought this drive to accomplish backups on our family computers. It was easy to put together, easy to install, and all the software is already loaded on it so when we plugged it in to our various macintoshes, we found no problem whatsoever. The firewire interfaces allow a lot of data backup in short periods of time, so that's cool. There's also a cool ""On-Auto-Off"" power switch which senses what your computer is doing, so you don't have to think about the proper sequence of turning on and off the drive in conjunction with the computer.So far so good. I just hope keeping the iTunes and iPhoto in sync is as easy as copying the data to the drive. My past experience tells me we're probably looking at some grief there, but that's plainly a function of Apple and OSX, not of LaCie.Zoot says check it out."
2,"Doesn't work with Vista, good drive otherwise",I wanted to confirm one of the other reviews here: there are no drivers available for Vista. I've been using the drive on my old xp machine for about 6 months though and it has worked great. As soon as the drivers are available (which should be Now!) it will be worth its money again.
4,Works just fine for my needs,"I bought the drive because I needed extra space for general use on a Mac running Tiger. It's been just fine. The fan is a little noisy but it's pretty much white noise and the backup software supplied is functional though pretty abbreviated in functionality (thus the 4 stars). I'd buy another, all things being equal."
5,Works great,"Works great out of the box with my Mac. This is my second 500 GB LaCie disk. The styling is the same, but the depth of this drive is half that of my other one. I'm using this for Super Duper backups as my other disk is full of movies.I've never had a problem with my old drive which must be 3 years old now."
1,Died after 2 months,Worked ok while it lasted. But now it won't turn on: it seems like it wants to but the blue light does not come on fully and just rapidly blinks and I had lost my data. I bought a new power supply just to find out that it was not the problem. This is now e-junk.
1,LaCie d2 Quadra 301110U - 2 dead within 18 months!,"I've had the same problem as many of the recent reviewers. Using this Lacie drive for MacOS Time Machine backups, 2 drives (one for my son, one for me) died within 18 months. The light blinks, but the drive is not recognized by MacOS. Piece of Crap!"
1,Too many LaCie disks have died.....,"I bought this in May 2008 and now the disk is dead. I searched Internet and found too many discussions about LaCie disk failures. You won't find as many failures from other manufactures. For a hard drive, you would expect it to last for 5 years or longer.Just google ""Lacie disk failure"" before you buy one based on average review score. Typically reviewers write reviews soon after they buy a product.I will never buy another LaCie."
1,Worked right up till it died,"When I first got it it was very loud. Obvious fan failure. Finally managed to get it replaced and it ran well right up until it started clicking. A mere 2 years later it is now quite dead.These are great to setup, run fine (only ran it when backing up so it's real life was much less than 2 years), quiet, cool looking... 5 stars for all that fluff. Tell it to the 60gig of music and years of photos that I had stored on it. Fortunately I keep dual backups and I didn't lose anything.Cannot recommend this product. The whole point is safeguarding data. All that other stuff is really meaningless when the clicking starts."
4,LaCie drives are known for their short life span...,"LaCie drives are known for their short lifespan... because of heat issues. I bought it because of price, with full knowledge of this. It seems to be working great now. And I am really hoping that what everyone told me will happen, doesn't happen. I use it for video editing, and it is great for that. The size, ruggedness of the metal case and variety of connections makes it very versatile and usefull... AT LEAST FOR NOW. I will check back in 1 year (aprox time that every professional in video editing has told me it will take for it to fail).But a few weeks after buying it... it works fine!!!"
3,A bit of a workhorse,"I have bought LaCie drives like this one for a few years now, and I love them all; this one has the largest capacity. Compared to those others, this one hums a bit too loud and vibrates as if something isn't tightened enough inside. I use it at work, however, not at home (and not all the time), so it hasn't bothered me much and perhaps it's a glitch more than a design flaw affecting all Quadra 500 GB units that they sell."
1,New Quadras Hopefully Better,"This drive has been discontinued (thankfully) - and I'm now patiently waiting for the price to become somewhat competitive on the new ones. Apparently, Lacie continues to believe that they have a lock on the Apple market and can continue charging Apple prices for their inferior products.At any rate, I received two of these drives, both of which were sent back. If you want to trust 500GB worth of data to a drive that constantly makes screeching, grinding metal-on-metal scratching noises, then this is the drive for you.The Seagate drive they stuck inside the case on these drives also has notoriously bad reviews.Stay away."
2,Works fine but has become extremely noisy recently,I purchased this Lacie product roughly 3 months ago based on years of satisfaction with a 500GB Dig Disk II.This drive gets the job done as well as the Big Disk II but in recent weeks it has become extremely noisy. (Sounds like a 60 Hertz humming amplified by this terrible scraping sound). The only way to stop this problem is to turn it horizontal from it's intended vertical position. Maybe it got rough handled or maybe Lacie has cut some quality corners.
2,LaCie d2 Quadra,"Overall, I'd rate the HD in the Lacie (Seagate) five stars. The Lacie diagnosis of the problem and Lacie's internal controller board 1 star.Bought a d2 Quadra 500GB early in 2008. It worked well for two years. Then the problems.The drive continued to operate as if it were powering up, but would not mount. Lacie diagnosed it as a power supply problem.Eventually went through three power supplies with no luck. I thought the drive and my data was dead. That was until I bought this...Thermaltake BlacX Duet eSATA USB Dual Hard Drives Docking Station ST0014U here at Amazon.I popped the drive out of the Lacie and dropped it into this docking station, and volia! The drive worked again. And has been rolling along for another two years already.Seems it was not a power supply problem. It was an internal Lacie controller that failed."
4,What a great series of cookbooks!,"Another outstanding book compiled by Napa Valley author Leslie Mansfield (her husband is winemaker at Bradford Mountain). She takes recipes from wineries throughout Northern California and puts them in to nifty themed books. This one - Barbecue Dishes, is just one of the newest series of three books that includes Picnics and Vegetarian Dishes. The recipes are easy to read and execute and there is wine pairings reccomended with each dish. Also has a little background about each winery. Check some of the other books Leslie has produced and you won't be dissapointed."
5,"""I Stand Alone"" by Agnetha Faltskog","This is an excellent CD. Agnetha seems to be at her best after a break of a few years. Her vocal quality has not deteriorated at all since her Abba years, in fact her voice seems to have become richer, but is still every bit as recognisable as it ever was. You can really hear Peter Cetera's production influence in most of the tracks, especially Let it Shine and of course the duet ""I Wasn't the One Who Said Goodbye"". My personal favourite is ""If you Need Somebody Tonight""; a classic love song if I ever heard one. Even though this CD was recorded 21 years ago, it still stands up today as a fine piece of work.If you like Agnetha and you like Peter Cetera, this CD is a must for you!"
4,AGNETHA ONE OF THE BEST FEMALE SINGERS EVER!,"THIS CD IS GOOD, A LITTLE LAID BACK THAN THE OTHER AGNETHA ALBLUMS BUT STILL GREAT."
5,She Does It Again!,"This collection of songs definitely shines, as well as the woman singing them. A perfect combination of vocal and style. Agnetha's voice on this album is absolutely brilliant. Don't pass on this one!"
1,"Agnetha of ABBA, Stand alone","Listening to her, the cd name is appropriate. She didn't have the sparkle projected when in the ABBA group."
3,Essential Agnetha,"Agnetha released 3 English language CD's in her post-ABBA singing career. All three releases are decent and have theirhighs and lows, but 'I Stand Alone' stands alone (pun intended) as Agnetha's best. Peter Cetera does a great job of producing the album, and in finding a sound that fits Agnetha quite well. Most of the songs are solid, and a few are outstanding.'I Wasn't the One' should have been a US top ten hit, and wasn't. The title track and 'Let It Shine' are among the bestthings Agnetha has done post-ABBA.Everyone has their own opinion about the post-ABBA work of Agnetha and Frida, but I have felt for quite a while that 'I Stand Alone' is the best of the girl's solo albums. This albumcaptured a very nice slice of the voice and persona of Agnetha, something that was sadly lacking in both of her previous solo CD's."
4,Compact And Useful Negotiation Guide,"This book is a very good introduction to negotiating. Though it is geared to business to business negotiations, it contains many useful tenants valuable in any type of negotiation, including home and car purchases, and to a limited extent job offers.I found many of the important bullet points to be especially succinct and well written, and recommend this guide for them alone. The text is generally well illustrated, though a few of the diagrams are a bit superfluous and less than helpful.This is an excellent compact guide and is handy as either an introduction or a refresher course on negotiating. I recommend it along with the rest of the series."
1,On The Money,"Why was I always 7 minutes late to any appointment or social event? This book explains many reasons for the behavior, gives easy, concrete suggestions for changing that behavior, and does it concisely, with order, thoughtfulness and humor. I am no longer late to anything! Have the lateness problem? Get this book."
2,If it weren't for Lucy Lawless the movie would be a big dud!,What a disappointment. Lucy had an appearence in the movie for less than 3 minutes. I could barely get through the rest of the flicks without falling asleep. Two thumbs down. Lucy needs to stick with Xena. Theres more girl to girl action on Xena than in this sorry foriegn flick.
1,Artsy Fartsy,"This movie is one of the worst. It has numerous short stories, if you can call them that. Lucy Lawless is the only reason they can sell this video and did she even speak? We need more than beauty and a peach! The whole thing looks like it was made directly from different peoples dreams--no plot, no sense and no entertainmnent. Here's where you wish the remote f.f. could go faster, but even then you feel jipped."
4,Inexpensive and Functional,"I spend a lot of time typing and have bad wrists. I need my keyboard to be tilted inversely to how they are normally built. Most keyboard trays offering the inverse tilt are $200+. I bought this and paired it with a flat keyboard drawer and it works great. It's easy to ""assemble"" and configure to your needs (left vs. right handed, inverse or normal tilt, different tilt angles) and inexpensive. I'm quite happy with my purchase."
3,Very Misleading!!,"I thought this was going to be an adjustable keyboard tray, when in fact, it is just an accessory to place atop an existing keyboard tray. There was no attachment to affix this under your desk. Not sure why it is called a ""tilt-adjustable"" platform. It's literally just a board with a wrist rest - there's nothing I could see that was adjustable about it. The seller should make this more clear, because I felt the product name and description were misleading."
3,NOT A KEYBOARD TRAY!,"While this shows when you search for a keyboard tray/drawer, it is NOT. It is a fifty dollar piece of plastic with a gel wrist sticky, that is it."
2,Not so comfortable,"Used this for about a month now, and I regret the purchase.Basically this is a large plastic plate with a thin stick-on sheet for a mouse pad, a non pliable wrist wrest, and stick-on plastic legs for adjusting the height of the keyboard.The regret is the wrist rest which is just so stiff, it actually hurts my wrist.The other regret is I didn't consider how long this thing is, so I can't store it under my desk, on the pull-out keyboard table. It's just too long.Cost prohibitive to return."
3,Turkish and sweet,"Elizabeth has a great teaching style and is very pleasant to listen to and watch.Moves are well demonstrated and DVD has good sections etc.My only criticism is that compared to some other good DVD's I have bought this was over double the price yet not as comprehensive as say Jehan, Jenna or Autumn or Leila.So whilst an ok DVD I feel it is overpriced - really should be about $13Good if you want understanding and insight into Turkish Style."
4,Artemis ISSS the Turkish Queen!,"Excellent DVD, but boooring! If you can sit for hours and listen to her talk about Turkish style dance, then go for it. She is the best Turkish teacher around, well, except for maybe Eva Cernick...."
5,I love this camera!!!,I have had this camera for almost 5 years. I have taken literally thousands of pictures with it and have never had a problem. I got it shortly after my son was born and have since used it to capture and freeze moments of his life. I take pictures almost on a daily basis not only of my family but also of nature and pretty much anything else that looks interesting. By no means am I a professional but in my opinion for a 5 yr old 4mp camera it still takes the sharpest most vibrant pictures. My mom recently bought my dream camera for herself and after using her camera then going back to my little minolta I still prefer my minolta.
2,Konica Minolta out of camera business,"After 2 1/2 years my Z2 camera stopped working. When I turn it on the shutter makes a noise and the memory light comes on and stays on. The lens does not extend. I went to the KM website only to find the company no longer makes cameras and Sony has taken the responsibility for repairs. Sony charges a flat rate of $181 to work on the camera, plus parts, and we pay the shipping to get it there. There is an internal battery in the camera but only the mfg can replace it. Will that cost me the flat rate +? Will replacing the battery fix my problem?"
2,Not automatic,"Having owned a Kodak 4Mp camera, we wanted to step up to a better lens and more zoom, so we bought a Z2. Although the pictures are good if everything is correctly set, this is a fairly rare coincidence. It took us quite a while to figure out that you must manually lift up the flash. We lost and still lose many pictures because we forget to do this. Also, this is not a camera that can be easily slipped into a pocket or purse. The 10x lens makes it bulky, and does not fully retract even when off. Because of these two things we have essentially abandoned this new Z2 in favor of our old Kodak. If you are looking for a point and shoot, to capture family moments and events, then this is not the camera for you."
2,Where's the color?,"I purchased my Z2 and couldn't wait to see the great images it could produce with 4 megs and 10x zoom. What a disappointment! I want my old Olympus 510 back. The color is horrible on the Z2. I could get the color ok by adjusting the white balance in the program modes (not using a flash), however it's not adjustable in the ""Auto"" mode, which also meant switching back to ""Auto"" for a flash shot. Also, this camera's size and shape make it totally impossible to just carry around in your pocket. I have missed way too many shots because I didn't have the camera with me."
4,not bad,this is my 4th digital camra.A nice camra with lot of faults.frist picture quality is very bad and Bluer as compare to my last camera Olympus C-740 .U can not edit movie with sound. In movie recording if U use zoom the sound of lense motor comes in recording. Power button turn on easily accidently . I call customer services to ask the speed of camera read/write they have no idea they just said its compatible . In market there is 512md SD card available at different speed.Memory card cover can be break any time so cheap . Same as battery cover.soon I am thinking for olympus C-770.nice grip. battery is good.features very easy and doog.bottom line picture quality barak my heart.
5,I love Minolta cameras,"This is a great camera and so easy to use; in fact, my neighbor who had the Olympus traded it to me for this one because of ease of use. I highly recommend it."
3,"A little ""frail""","This camera is overall good buy for the price, however, it feels like it is going to break apart in my hands. The body is very poorly constructed, made out of cheap plastic. The black grip from the picture looks as if it is rubber, but...no. It is cheap plastic like the rest of it. Too bad, with a little extra ""beef"" it could be a bargain."
5,Great sleeveless bodysuits!,Very soft fabric - medium thickness (not lightweight but also not too heavy). It has well-made bottom snaps and comfortable sleeveless design. The size is appropriate for the given 0-3 months age range. The tags in the neck are huge but at least soft (and of course could be cut off to avoid scratching baby's neck).
4,like them a lot,"i just ordered the 9 month size of these tank top style onesies. i first tried this product in the 3 month size and loved them and i would definitely recommend them to anyone looking for onsies to go under tank tops. the only problem i found is that after a bunch of washes, they start to really lose their quality... however i did get a lot of use out of them.... we just do a lot of wash around here!"
4,Great for Summer!,I bought these for my daughter about two weeks ago and since she started wearing them my wife has told me around six times how much she likes them. They are soft and cool. Perfect for summer!
1,Way too small,"We returned these because they were incredibly small. Also, the fabric was not nice and soft like I had thought it would be. They washed terribly and the overall construction was poor. Our Target-bought onesies are a million times better than these, you just have to remember to stock up on the sleeveless ones in the summer because you can't get them any other time of the year and they are nice to put under jammies and tops."
5,SpaSilk tank onesies,"I love these and will order more. I read another review that said they ran big, but I found that they run True to size. I have an average size baby and she fit into her size by age. Quality is great. They later well."
2,spa silk,"Not true to size, after few washes fabric doesn't stay nice. Shrunk in the dryer.First couple of wears were nice."
3,Don't buy - get Gerber instead.,"I am generally not a fan of Gerber clothes for babies - they run small and are typically flimsy. I like to have tank tops for my daughter to wear under the sleep-and-plays, so I searched and searched for something that is high quality and comfortable. The spa silk ones are certainly soft and made of quality materials, but I found the neck opening to be very small - it always tugs and makes my daughter squirm when I try to pull them over her head. Then I found the Gerber tanks in white on the clearance rack and I decided to try them. They are great! They fit well, they are not too thick, and they have the crossed-over shoulders that allow a better fit over her head. They do tend to run a little small, so get one size larger, but otherwise I like those much better as layering pieces. Cheaper, too."
2,Drawn out too long!!!,It's good writing but it's just takes too long to get where it's going. It could had been better with at least 100 pages less.
5,Penelope Williamson does it again and again...,"Of all of Ms. Williamson's books, I have enjoyed ""The Passions of Emma,"" ""The Outsider,"" and now ""Heart of the West"" the best. In ""Heart of the West,"" Ms. Williamson indeed writes to the heart. This is not a silly romance - it is an epic novel about many people seeking what we all seek - love. It's about the strength of women and men and how those different strengths come together and make each relationship unique. Emphasis is on the ""forbidden"" love of soulmates Zach and Clementine, and this love will leave a lump in your throat and an ache in your heart - but don't worry, it's a good ache. Don't miss this book, you'll have missed something good."
3,A fast paced thriller,"Captain Cameron and his crew are manoeuvring the ""Indomitable"", a British carrier, off the coast of Numala. In the capital Kindalu, Nathan Nabote, a throwback of an old-style African dictator, in absolute power since 1969, is eyeing discontentedly on the upcoming presidential election. Despite Nabote's reluctance, the EU sent an observer mission and the carrier ""Indomitable"" is part of the scheme to monitor that the election takes place in a democratic manner.The question is of course will Nabote let the election be fair and will he give his opponent, Michael Endebbe, a chance to win? Or will the Presidential Guard, a formidable army and totally loyal to Nabote, try to stop the democratic process in Numala?As Michael Endebbe is kidnapped and tortured a few days before the election is due to commence, the crew of the ""Indomitable"" sense that their task is going to be an almost ""mission impossible""."
2,Ten Poems to Set you Free,Disappointed that there was so much written about the poems in between. Would rather have had it in a synopsis at the end instead.
3,Its okay,"The book is good. The author, itself, seems just a bit pompous which gets in the way at times. Worth reading anyway!"
5,Car charger for Samsung VI660,"I was going to buy a car charger from my cellular provider, but the cost was $39.99. Then, I saw this item under $10. I was skeptical. But the product works great, and very happy w/ the prompt deliver. Will definitely do business again. Thank you.Roberto H."
5,school sucks,it's a school book. who likes school books? honestly? but no it's ok. no complaints from me...
2,Surprised,Well this product wasnt in the best condition that it said to be in. It wasnt bound.It had been three ring hole punched.Had I known that I wouldnt have purchased. So now im praying the pages will hold up till the semester is over.
2,Not the best Quality,"The particular copy I received was damaged and worn out. I am not in favor to use an ugly book for my academic studies. I was disappointed, but refunded promptly for the costs."
5,My purchases,I was really amazed how fast I received my Sociology in our times. That will keep me coming back to place my orders in the future with Amazon.
1,service,i wouldnt recommend buying anything from this seller. they are unreliable and your product probably will not even be sent to you even if your payment has gone through. i ordered a book weeks ago and it still has failed to be shipped.
2,Christian Sermon on the Glories of the Afterlife -- A Message of Faith,"""In this world of mortality comes the glorious message that mortal life is finished here in Christ, greater glories open up than we have ever dreamed of, where there is no emphasis at all on decay and death, but only on life and hope."" (p 38)Above quote is the message/content of the book. Peale was a preacher, and poetic quotes and stories of fellowship abound, but ultimately no evidence graces the volume. I had hoped for less sermon and more reason. Add two stars if you share Peale's Christian faith and are a regular church-goer, because then you are the target audience."
5,matched perfectly,Highly recommend. Looks like one piece with the Sony KDS-60A2000TV. It has notches for the TV legs for stability and also a strap to tie in from behind with the Sony KDS-60A2000 TV for safety.
4,Customer built stand for your Grand Wega,"This TV stand is very nice. My 60"" SXRD Grand Wega fits perfectly. There is a front piece that you install after you put the TV on the stand. This piece wraps around the very bottom of the TV make the stand and TV look like one. Setting it up was very easy. Someone definitely did their research when developing the manufacturing specs for packing because each part is clearly labeled and easy to install. My only gripe is the same as the other reviewer. I can't place my center speaker or my receiver on the top shelf because the opening isn't big enough. The receiver placement doesn't bother me as much as the speaker placement because now instead of sitting directly below the TV and centered, my center speaker is not offset and on the lower shelf about a foot away from the TV. It would of been nice if it were reversed: that is for the upper shelf to have more headroom than the lower shelf."
5,"Great unit, but had shipping damage","My KDS-55A2000 looks great on this thing! The triangular shape made it fit perfectly in an otherwise hard-to-fit corner. Is very sturdy and was easy to assemble. My only complaint is the broken rear support peice and badly gashed top shelf. Fortunately, I was able to repair the rear support with wood glue, and the gashes in the top were covered by the front fascia, but it looks like UPS (or Amazon's handlers) threw the box down a flight of stairs! The box was badly torn and bashed up--I'm AMAZED the glass shelves weren't broken!"
4,Easy to assemble!!!,"Great stand, very sturdy. Easy to assemble, about a half an hour or so, all you need is a phillips screwdriver and a flat head(or a dime). Only complaint is the top shelf is not tall enough, it should be the same size as the bottom....my center channel speaker would not fit on the top shelf. I love how the tv locks into the front and that the strap locks into the tv itself at the back. This tv is not going to fall over!!!!"
3,They should have done an anthology,"I love the Fatback Band, but the reason I am giving it a 3 instead of a five is there are a lot of good songs missing. What they should have done is a sort of anthology, dividing the 70s from the 80s funk and included a lot more hot songs. I was really disappointed because this doesn't cover the entire scope. I guess it's better to just go out and buy the Fatback Band CDs that move you the most and enjoy the songs on them. It's more expensive, but this Best of CD just doesn't cut it."
5,"I love the book. It was like Conan, Tarzan and Stra Trek",The book were very well done. Yet I like the way gave the charactors unique personalities. The faith in god and their ethnics and principles. I really thought their love for their familiesand the faith in God were excellent.END
2,Very disappointing compared to earlier editions,"Since the earlier editions are out of print, I was overjoyed to hear that a new edition was coming out, only to discover that the new edition omits all the information on individual episodes that was the hallmark of the original edition in 1981. This new volume should have been renamed, cause it is no longer encyclopedic."
2,Not as useful as previous editions,"I have a previous edition of this book, so I was excited to find this latest one. However, the book now consists of ONLY the name of the series, a brief paragraph about it, and perhaps a voice actor list. In the process of adding more shows, the book became less interesting and useful as a resource."
1,Jeff Lenburg needs to do some research,"The Encyclopedia of Animated cartoons, 2nd edition, is *full* of errors. One has to wonder where Jeff Lenburg got his information from. One can turn to practically any page and find glaring errors in both plot synopsis, voice actors and character descriptions. Such as Space Ghost being power by a magic belt, Dino-boy being sent back in time do to an explosion that killed his father(!) ""Mr.Toad Hall"" who is 'wrongly' accused of car thievery,Etc. The list goes on and on. However, it is a great fun for someone who's familiar with cartoons (at all)to read through and mark the errors, which are, in plentiful supply."
4,An excellent (if somewhat flawed) resource,"Less of a book than a listing, The Encyclopedia of Animated Cartoons has an exhaustive listing of cartoons from the 'teens up until about 1997. Best of all are the titles for theatrical shorts and detailed listings of Emmy and Oscar nominees/winners. If you need (or want) to look up something about a cartoon, this is probably the best place to look.However, this book is *not* perfect. Besides being some 6 years out of date, the book doesn't track direct-to-video movies and seems to neglect a few imported cartoons that had hit airwaves before 1997. Also, many '80s cartoons (particularly those from the great toy-license revolution) have incorrect series synopses, voice credits, and even entries (such as the listings for G.I. Joe). This book is invaluable, yes, but it is sorely in need of a third edition (and possibly a co-author who can research obscure and/or lesser regarded cartoons). Keep this in mind before purchasing the second edition."
3,Not as good as her other novels...,"I didn't like this book as much as I like the rest of them in the series, primarily because the killer's identity is revealed right at the beginning. It is an interesting storyline and McDermid's writing is easy to follow, but I missed the whodunit suspense."
4,Competent but Gruesome,"Val McDermid is a well-practiced author of British police procedural mysteries. This book is one of a series centered on the profiler Tony Hill, whose methods are mistrusted by more conventional police officers. In this case, the serial killer is a high-profile public personality described as the third most trusted person in England. McDermid's descriptions of the hunt for this murderer, including the tangents and false leads, are well done. On the down side, the reader may have trouble keeping track of the many characters with common English names. McDermid's graphic portrayals of the killer's brutality may churn some stomachs."
2,Homosexuality,"If this is the author's choice of lifestyle, fine. But I think emasculating her male protagonist is taking it over the edge, and takes away from the book rather than enhancing it. I don't think I'll be reading anymore of her books."
5,Tony Hill,"Loved this book which I first read many years ago. I rebought it a month or two ago after reading Retribution, some strange parallels with all the celebrity/ Jimmy Saville news around at the moment"
4,Refreshing twist on the serial killer genre,"This is a very easy book to read. It holds your interest and has some good story lines. Tony Hill is a flawed, interesting and quirky character that draws you into his world and that of Bradford. The British do crime so well. The plot development is not predictable like so many other 'serial killer' novels and contains characters that seem real. Now that I have read the first and second in the Tony Hill series I will read the rest. If you like Patricia Cornwell, Kathy Reichs, James Patterson, Tess Geretssen and other Crime writers you'll Val McDermid quite refreshing."
3,Good product for the cost.,"These state that they can fit 40 sheets, but I had a really hard time squeezing 25 sheets... So it worked, but not as well as I had hoped."
2,not woth the money,"in order to use Larson's program , you need to use TC2005. Most of his seminar can be learned on any technical site such as Clearstation. Also, the CD advertises a method that works 90%of the time-you must attend the seminar to discover how to set this up on TC2005.GO to TC2005 discussion board, do search for Larson,even the tc2005 people do not know how to combine TSV and RSi-this is the indicator Larson claims works 90% of the time.This CD is merely an advertisement to buy more cds.I wasted $60.00. lynn"
1,some indicators are only available in TC2000,"If you don't use TC2000, it wastes your time and money. Some key indicators he talks about are only available in TC2000."
1,Great when it worked,"I have had this unit for about 3 years now. It has had constant issues. To be honest, Lacie tech support was great when the drive was still in warranty so I have no issues with them. It is just that the hardware is so bad. From failed power bricks, to faulty internal components, it took almost a year to before I was able to use the product regularly. It worked fine for the past 2 years until it powered off and would not power back on recently. I have two other NAS drives that have been working fine on my network for the past 5 years, so to see this one constantly failing is a great disappointment."
1,"Complete Data Loss, with little chance for recovery","This drive failed. After three or four months of use, the drive failed to be accessible over the network. I was also unable to access the drive using the firewire adapter.The La Cie tech support people could not help with the problem -- at all.From what I am reading, I will not be able to access the data, because the drive stores it using proprietary raid striping. (I'm technical, but not that technical.) So even if there is data on the drives, I won't be able to get at it.I am so over La Cie, that I will never purchase another product from them. This product failed at the most basic level."
1,Don't Do It,"Died within three months of light usage. Furthermore, customer service, while helpful, was slow and understaffed. I have had poor experience with LaCie in general--4 of the 5 drive I have bought in the last year have died--and I use G-Tech instead."
1,Probably the slowest,"I am using this drive on a Windows system. Even though the product is called a gigabit ethernet network drive, it has the slowest transfer rate imaginable.On Retrospect duplicates, the drive continues to register a time-stamp difference error for most files when comparing the duplicate. That means each time Retrospect runs, it must reduplicate all of the existing files. Installing updated firmware did not resolve the problems.Noise was not that loud for me.Sorry I bought this drive."
2,NOT VISTA READY,"At the time of writing this the 2 TB version does not play well with Vista. If you have XP and below you're fine. But Vista is another issue. Perhaps sometime soon they MAY decide to get with the program and do something about it, but as of 10-24-08 Vista compatibility is still only a pipe dream."
1,I will never buy another LaCie product again,"I've had the LaCie Ethernet Big Disk for over a little over a year. In that time, it has never consistently worked. I can't transfer more than about 100 files to it at a time; it will disconnect itself from my Mac-based network and I'll have to unplug and replug it in order for it to show up again. This is true whether it is plugged directly into the Ethernet port on my Airport or it is plugged into the USB port on my computer.I finally gave in and purchased an Airport Extreme and a USB Hard Drive (from G-Drive). It works amazingly well. I recommend you do that and do NOT purchased a NAS from LaCie."
4,GREAT PURCHASE!,"Its really a great purchase i would never regret it, I had some problems installing it in the network, but when I switched off the windows firewall everything went cool, the software is good you can make alot of users to access the hard disk for specific folders for specific operations(read-write,read-only)"
1,Not recommended for Macs,"Have had a couple of these drives connected to a 1Gb switch. They work fine with SMB and Windows networks, but we experienced big problems accessing from Macs using Tiger. The drives would perform ok for a few days then AFP access would fail - have to delete the .appledb file from a Windows machine or SMB connection. Also files over 2Gb tend to get corrupted - not good when backing up large video projects. Overall, disappointed in this drive & would not recommend them."
1,Do NOT buy if you use Mac OS X 10.5 (Leopard),"It does NOT work with Mac OS x 10.5 Leopard. Do not buy it! Network speed is extremely slow (more than 10 hours to copy 10Gig) and you cannot use time machine with it. You get no help from LaCie support.Really frustating, waste of money."
1,Extra-large paperweight,"I just got Time Machine with my new Leopard operating system, and needed a big disk to back up to. Oops. This disk is incompatible with Time Machine. So I tried using SuperDuper to back up instead. Nope. Runs for hours, then crashes. The disk records a system log - it fills up with uninterpretable error messages. LaCie support doesn't know what the error codes on *their own disk* mean. Tried to return it - can't make returns without every bit of the original packing material and paperwork. Nice paperweight, though."
1,Poor Network Interface,"This HDD has a very poor interface to the cpu and the network. If you are looking to share a drive across the network you are better off getting the standard USB drive and sharing it from the server, or one of the network users. I have already sent my Ethernet drive back for the standard USB one."
1,Not ready for prime time on Mac,"I bought this network drive from Amazon for use with a new Mac running Leopard. The IP Config routine that shipped with the disk was out of date and the newest version from LaCie could not connect to the disk via USB, direct (to computer) ethernet, or to an Air Port Extreme hub. Under Network, the drive was tagged as being connected via modem. Nor could it be connected using the Air Port disk Utility. Last, LaCie offers no path to uninstall the code created by their installer. LaCie on-line support folks tried hard to help, but after more than a week of back and forth, I gave up and returned the unit to Amazon. Thank you Amazon for no hassle returns.Short story: don't by this for a Mac running OS 10.5.1 until LaCie figures out Leopard and does a fix. This drive system was a a real disappointment from an otherwise good manufacturer."
1,Mac users beware,"Other folks have gone into detail, so I'll keep my comments brief.* Can't back up to a network drive using Time Machine - the whole reason I bought it* Leopard sees the drive as a modem when connected by USB. No ETA on a driver fix so that it can be used as a USB drive.I wish I'd checked all the reviews before purchasing and saved myself the headache, but for some reason, I took the following at face value: ""Universally accessible on every wired or wireless network, this drive is capable of sharing files between Windows, Mac and Linux users. If there is no network available, the Ethernet Big Disk can be used with your PC or Mac without any file system limitations.""Good luck!"
1,"Don't buy,you better invest your money somewhere else","I've bought this product 2 weeks ago,to cut the story short,6 PCs failedto recognize this product using either the USB or Ethernet interfaces,I tried to contact LaCie technical team,but their support was less than satisfactory,so I stripped off the device and decided to use the 2 500GB hard disk as internal storage and save some of the money I already lost when I purchased this model"
4,Incredibly Fun Toy. Unfortunately defective.,"I have never written a review for anything, but I wanted to review this item that my daugter received for Christmas. She, and I must admit the rest of us (adults included), had a blast with this toy. It provided hours and hours of fun - for about three days. And then it broke. The video cord was defective and we were unable to see the picture, even though we could still hear the game. Amazon is supposed to replace the defective item - And I have to admit that my daughter cannot wait for the replacement.All in all, I think this is a great toy. More fun than real mini-golf. I just wish ours would have worked longer."
4,Not the best golf game,"There are only four courses you can play on this game and they are all mini-golf style. The graphics are very hard on the eyes and it's difficult to see exactly what it is that you're aiming at.The ""ball"" is extremely sensitive. We end up with a lot of misfires trying to aim the ball on the screen. For some reason it thinks that you were trying to hit the ball. Also, misfires happen a lot when passing the club around to the next player.It's a neat idea to have a self-contained system for a golf game, but it could use some improvements. You'd be better off getting a golf game on a console."
5,Great family fun,My son received this game for his birthday. We love to play this game as a family. It is a lot of fun and great entertainment
4,Worth owning,The stout-hearted title can be a little misleading for it ultimately purports to answer the most redundant question ever proposed. Nonetheless it is quite funny and the artwork is exquisite. Great as a little gag gift for anyone needing to give their spirits a lift.
5,Atomic Betty finally makes it to DVD,"If you are an ""Atomic Betty"" fan, then you'll probably appreciate this DVD. On it are the episodes 'Toxic Talent,' 'Spindly Tam Kanushu,' 'Atomic Roger,' 'Furball for the Sneeze,' 'Really Big Game,' 'But the Cat Came Back,' 'The Doppelganger,' and 'The Incredible Shrinking Betty.'There is one special feature that might catch your attention. It is a music video featuring Atomic Betty's voice actor, Tajja Isen. The surprising thing is that she's only thirteen.The price is pretty decent. Amazon even has it marked down about six bucks. Again, if you're an ""Atomic Betty"" fan, get this DVD. I can tell you that I'll be."
1,Disappointing,"This 44-page booklet has some sound-bites on dysgraphia and provides an overview of some of the issues, but lacks the detail I was looking for in aiding my 8 year old son."
3,"Basic, guidebook information","I bought this book hoping to get a ""rating"" on the boarding schools. This book is geared towards international students looking to attend American boarding schools (we are American). The writing is clear and friendly. But, I did not get any more information than I would fine in the Peterson's guide book."
4,Worthwhile budget disc,"OK, so maybe the performance of the First Piano Concerto isn't all that jaw-dropping or distinctive, and not in the same league as Argerich or Van Cliburn. But it's still worth a listen, and Glemser/Wit's laid back approach reveals that the old warhorse's greatness is in the subtle, quieter moments, not the pounding chords. The remaining pieces on this disc, especially the Andante and Finale, are intriguing and uncommon enough finds to make the disc worth the modest asking price."
4,Kicking Cage,"The kicking cage was all I expected, and more. My son is thrilled with it and uses it all the time. It has made his life easier when practicing punts or field goals, as he does not have to chase the balls any more. The company was great also. It was missing a couple of nuts and bolts due to minor box damage, and they sent replacement parts out in a timely fashion."
2,Net Ripped at ends after 3 Months,Net Ripped at ends after 3 MonthsNot good for a kid in High School sports
4,Outstanding for the price,"Perfect for the kicker who wants to train at home. Assembly was straight forward and pretty simple. Very sturdy all around (frame, net, etc..) Would recommend."
5,Great kicking cage for a middle school kicker,My son has been kicking into this cage for 13 months now. It was used daily for a couple of hours during football season and it has held up perfectly. I broke it down and set it up for each of his games so he could stay warm on the sideline. It is pretty easy to take apart and setup and not too heavy for an average size man to carry around. Probably a little too much to handle for a middle school kid. I highly recommend this kicking cage...especially at this price point.
4,Does the job,"This net is easy to assemble/disassemble and is not too heavy. The net pulled out of the edging in one place which i fixed myself but it was a pain. The only real draw back is the lack of a carry bag, you can buy one but it is way too expensive for a bag."
5,bought this as a gift and they loved it,can not find this in any store and is what my daughter in law uses she was thrilled I found it Hopefully you will keep this in your market
5,This old new parfume discovered!,"I was usuing Eclat by Lanvin for a while, always got tons of compliments and gave it as gifts to many of my friends who call this smell magic and attractive. I went through 2 bottles in one year considering I own about 10 different parfumes! I decided to search online reviews on other Lanvin parfumes from people who like Eclat and found this perfume mentioned by lots of women. I ordered it without smelling it first (since they don't sell it in stores). I was pleasantly surprised to like it as much as Eclat, even better for now since I got kinda of tired of Eclat for now. So if you like fresh, woody, not annoying sweet smell go for it, especially for this low price - you wouldn't regret. And yes, I get lots of compiments on this parfume now too :)"
1,Be careful!!!,"I would like to just say that I never received this item and I am not happy b/c I was expeting this item before Christmas for a gift. According to the delivery date I was suppose to receive this item on the 23 of December but never did. Now here we are in 2012 and still have not received my purchased item....I am very disappointed with this seller. As a result I will not be purchasing anything from this seller in the future. I hope I will be reimbursed all my money back b/c it's not fair that I was charged for something that I never got, I would like to find out how I can go about to get in contact with this seller? So please be very careful!!"
2,no pairing possible,"made to give BT capabilities so you can...what? Use BT headphones? Sure but BT headphones and this dont work.Why: you cannot pair two BT devices is neither of them has a graphic interface so you can set them to pair. BT headpones have no display, this also has no display therefore, no pairing is possible."
3,An o.k. debut album,"Just as Mylene's second album ""Ainsi soit je"", this CD offers some great, danceable synth pop songs like ""Libertine"", ""Tristana"", and ""We'll never die"". Besides, this album is weak, featuring exceptionally childish and boring tracks like ""Chloe"" and ""Plus grandir"". Still, a decent debut of a young artist yet to mature."
1,Mylène Farmer : the ambiguous (wo)man?,"The first album of the false red-haired teenaged pupil directed by the master Laurent Boutonnat in 1986 was the beginning of the ""Farmer's most hot obsessions show"" which is more and more boring 13 years after.The song ""Chloé"" which says ""Yeah!my friend Chloé is dead"" is horrible.We hope that an other red-haired bitch looking called Axelle Red is not gonna take the same way."
3,Not the best,"When selecting a book I look for author first and then read the opening section of the first chapter. I have always found that Ruth Rendell's opening lines make me want to read more. Her characters are well crafted and you can get a sense of realism that many authors fail to achieve. This time though the book concentrates more on the feelings of Inspector Wexford and less on character & plot development. The side plots did not blend together into a seamless whole and it was hard to link the different plots together. There are times when the book is very tense but mostly it lacked the energy to keep you enthralled. I felt I wanted to get to the end of the book to see how it all fitted together but was left with a disappointing ""Oh is that it?"""
4,Road Rage Review,"Good mystery, but a bit of a problem re motivation - not really revealed until the end, but hinted at very slightly earlier on."
5,Rendell scores again,"This time Chief Inspector Wexford has a crisis on his hands which is more of a personal nature. A group of environmental extremists calling themselves ""Sacred Earth"" have kidnapped five people to protest the building of a major freeway. One of the hostages happens to be Wexford's wife Dora. As precious time ticks away, Wexford and his crime team attempt to locate the kidnappers with the clues they have at hand before it is too late. As always, Rendell's writing is superb. The characters are well rounded with deep psychological motivations. Wexford's private torment while trying to keep up his professional front is as always, very admirable. If the torment of his wife being kidnapped is not enough, he is also dealing with the birth of a grandchild.This latest Ruth Rendell novel is a good fast read and is very satisfying."
4,Road Rage,"Another enjoyable rainy day read until (SHOCK HORROR) Ruth Rendell mentions ""the LATE Sir Edmund Hilary"" - NZ's conquerer of Everest. LATE? maybe sometimes but certainly NOT Dead!"
3,"Worst of luck, Hillary is still kicking 18 months later","I enjoyed the book, but was very surprised at the reference to the late Sir Edmund Hillary - I had just read an interview with him in yesterday's paper. Unfortunately it will be what I remember best from the book."
4,Don't let the price scare you away from this CD!,"Please note that I am just a casual fan of Toto, and I bought this CD exclusively for ""Hold The Line."" While I'm quite sure that no tracks on here other then ""Hold The Line"" or ""Africa"" were ever hits, some of the eight other tracks are pretty good.I figure that a CD single costs this much, and at least this ""single"" has two guaranteed winners. If it just had ""Rosanna,"" it probably would be thee CD for the casual fan of Toto.Everything appears to be taken right off the albums with no live tracks, as far as I can tell.For the record, here is the track listing:1) Hold The Line2) Rockmaker3) Live For Today4) Lorraine5) Girl Goodbye6) Africa7) Endless8) How Does It Feel9) Lion10) If It's The Last Night"
1,Poor book,I recommend not to waste money on this book. Very disappointing book from Imperial College London. The name is deceiving. There is nothing about practical railway engineering.I reviewed this book when my friend has bought. Thanks God I did not buy myself.
1,Stop this insanity!,"If you pick up this film, see the words ""The Sting is in the Tale"", and think it's clever, then you might just enjoy this crappy ""Bee Movie"" knock off. That's all I can really say about it."
1,very dissapointed,it was nothing like bee movie and the story plot was good but it was not good enough to hold young viewers attention
2,Too electronic,"The didgeridoo and her voice are awesome, but the songs are ruined by that cheezy '90's synthesizer sound. Take out all the synth (especially the horrid sounding drums) and add more didgeridoo and vocals and you'd have magic."
5,Zoo Life with Jack Hanna- Bonkers for Babies,"Wonderful video. Our whole family loves it, especially our one and a half year old."
4,This is house,"I'm not quite sure waht lucie is talking about when she says this isn't house because this is a great cd. Morillo has gotten away from the whole filter house sound and incorporated a good deal more driving, tribal qualities to his mix. This is a great taster for someone who wants to find out what subliminal is all about. My only gripe is sputnik by pete heller. I. for one, think that this track is overplayed. It also bears a close resemblance in the breakdown section of the song to wink's "" so how's your evening so far"""
2,this cd is definitely not the predicted 5 stars!!,"first of all, if you are looking for slamming house beats, this is definitely not the cd you need...the music on this cd is more dancy-techno-funk....not house....very very disappointed and wish to god i could send it back...his previous work is definitely better...but my dear house fans, you will be almost certainly DISAPPOINTED...SO DONT BOTHER BUYING IT IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR SLAMMING UNDERGROUND HOUSE BEATS....LUCIE"
5,Great fit and quality,"The neoprene looks really good quality, it has a super soft flexible feel to it.Compared this to some of the other suits out at a much higher price but for the price and free shipping this is the best deal and quality.The zipper was long enough to make the suit easy to put on and the shoulders fit good but have enough space for easy movement, even for paddling.Nice"
4,Good for paddling,"I bought this for kayaking on the rivers around Portland, OR.This is comfortable and light enough not to interfere with anything and since I am usually out alone or with my small child it's essentially a piece of safety equipment. Sooner or later I will probably end up in the water and depending on the time of year these rivers get pretty darn cold."
3,Muffled Sound Quality,"It is hard to tell what the cause of the muffled sound is on this recording. Placement of mics, recording techniques, mixing procedures... are all possible culprits. The performance is hard to judge becuase of the muffled sound. I would presume that in order to get a doctorate, Donald Hunt knows what he is doing. It would be interesting to get his comments. I liked the pieces he chose for the CD but was less than inspired when listening to his performance. Track 16 - Preludes Welsh Hyfrydol was the best performance on the disk. I would be curious to find out the kind of organ used for this performance... and to see the registrations chosen."
3,Spanish history lesson,"This book is really only a glorified history lesson, featuring Phillip IV of Spain, his wife Isabel, his more important advisors and his mistresses. I don't understand why Mrs. Keyes even undertook such a story or what persuaded her that enough readers would be interested in the subject (excepting Spaniards of course) A large part of Europe was ruled by the Hapsburgs and the Bourbons at that time, Queen Isabel being the daughter and sister of French Bourbon kings. If you wanted to read this as strictly a history lesson, that's fine but I really couldn't recommend it as an interesting novel."
2,Kiss and tell,"Although Mrs. Yancey had no love-affair with Elvis, she claims - according to the title of her book - to have lived with Elvis. That's not quite what happened, but she was for a period of 13 years his private secretary. ""My life with Elvis"" is a collection of her memories of Elvis, Elvis' family, the Memphis Maffia, Linda Thompson, the fans etc. Included are further some funny - and less funny - stories she experienced working for Elvis and a few pages with black and white pictures. The book is easy to read and special, because this was one of the first books written about Elvis by (former) employees. In fact, this book was written when Elvis was still alive and Becky Yancey claims that Elvis gave his approval to her book, which has been published shortly after Elvis' death, so she had to write an extra chapter to ""complete"" her storie. Like most books of this genre, it isn't great literature, but for the die-hard Elvis-fan it will be fun to read, although not essential."
3,medication reminder,This is the second time I purchased one of these items. The first lasted pretty good and I was pleased with its performance. This one the alarm is to soft and I am unable to hear it most of the time. I take my first pill at 7:30am and use to use the pill box as an alarm to wake me. There is no way that that can happen with this second one. I guess I just thought that they would all be the same.
5,Mini pill organizer,"It's great, but you don't need it if you buy the one-week version because it can separate into a small, one-day version with a timer."
4,"Dear Timex,",When the alarm is louder (or adjustable) and it is possible to turn off timers out of sequence; you'll have a great product!
1,LEDs don't work,Unfortunately mine arrived with about 1/4 of the LEDs not working. There's no way to contact the company online for customer service.
2,Replacement item,I got a replacement item for the Timex I originally requested. The replacement is doing the job...
2,Not my favorite infrared book,"Of course with art being such a subjective medium, it's hard to be objective. That being said, I'm not terribly impressed with work presented in this book. The technical information is fine, but why confuse the purpose of the book. The images are mediocre at best. I don't see any new ground being explored with the incredible creative tools that are described. Buy it if you are trying to gather a library of books relating to infrared photography, not if you want to be inspired or educated."
5,The Book on Color Infrared Photography,This is truly the only book devoted just to color infrared film photography. The author takes great care in explaining how this film works and how to best utilize it's potential. The images are intriguing and unusual. I found it to be a great addition to my library of photography texts.
5,A New Perspective on Photography,"Begleiter's new book is wonderful. It is a wealth of information from the broadest concepts in infrared photography to the most technical subtleties. The artwork within is fantastic. It is an entirely new and different approach to taking pictures - one that is fun, energetic and new. Each photograph portrays the outstanding qualities/differences of infrared film - truly a new way to vision photography and the world around us. I recommend this book highly as both a teaching tool and as a coffee table piece sure to inspire much conversation."
3,feedback,"This item was not the proper one for my model as advertised, however, I was able to make it work."
3,Concise and a good starting point,I'm a busy medical practioner. This book is a concise guide which is what I needed to assist in assessing students. It is well referenced which allows those who wish to delve deeper - in fact some references are repeated - but a minor quibble!!
3,Some clarity beneath the muck...,"While this much maligned biography may indeed dwell a little too much on Bernstein's personal life (how many times do we really need to be told he was gay? this gets tiresome after awhile...) Peyser does include a wealth of competently researched background on the life of this most American of musicians. If you aren't offended by the cheap and trashy (but rarely explicit) parts, it's worth a read. Keep your nose in joint and take this biography for what it is and you'll probably learn a few things!"
1,This book is TRASH,"This book is one big gossip column about Bernstein 1) being bi-sexual or 2) Bernsteins apparent motivation to constantly undermind other people and turn the focus of anything to himself. Bernstein certianly had an ego, but this book is simply not accurate. In the introduction the author says, ""The crevices of character have to e explored as fully as the peaks of achievements to understand...."" She certianly explored the ""crevices."" Instead of spending $18 on this go buy the National Enquirer."
5,Could not put it down!,"Read this (it seems) in one sitting. Recommended to anyone interested in Bernstein, or in the music of our day."
1,It reads like fiction.,If Ms. Peyser would check her facts and do her research she just might have written a book worth reading.
4,yeah...hardcore.....good anyway,"schlong is the weirdest punk band ever. dave mello from op ivy was in them, but they sound nothing like that. it's just really goofy, dorky punk. if you like all you can eat or one eye open you should get this. this is a collection of 7""es and comp songs. my only problem with this is there are too many 3 finger spread songs (their bluegrass alter-ego). check out the entire cover of fleetwood mac's 'rumours' album, cleverly titled 'tumours.'"
2,Painfully bad acting!,"I bought this DVD actually thinking I was buying a different movie that I loved a few years ago. Besides the disappointment that it wasn't the movie I thought it was. STILL, the acting is just plain BAD. Ice-T was even a terrible actor in this film. And I like Ice-T as an actor! 95% of this film takes place in an abandoned warehouse and just drags on and on. The plot is so simple, how can anyone screw it up? BAD ACTING! Don't waste your time. Unless you have too much time on your hands..."
2,The Heist DVD,"Ice T was starting to improve with his acting in this phase of his career. It was entertaining to see the decision to use an ice cream truck as a getaway vehicle for a crime like this. A few funny scenes, but it is hard to recommend this. It is an acquired taste like someone who never had a beer. Product was in fair condition."
3,Fun but not exceptional,"Brought this on sale for ten bucks. It is worth that but not much more. My 5YO has fun with it and the moles are cute. The plastic hammer is a bit clumsy so he uses his hands a lot. This toy has no educational value. Although this toy is mediocre at best, it is better than having to go to Chuck-E-Cheese or some other equally replusive place.Note: If you have the white unit: there is an On/Off switch along the side that is rather difficult to see. Make sure to turn it on before assuming the toy is DOA. (Yes, I found the switch, but it took me a few seconds)"
3,"Good implementation, but not so great light",I found this lamp as very good assembled with high quality. But i think the light is not so good for office desks. The light spot has explicitly defined borders and shadow circle in the middle of this spot.
2,Fast but crashes frequently,"This sped up my graphics, but after installation, my computer crashed frequently. I had to replace it with the old video card just so I could use my computer."
1,Trash - a complete waste of time and money.,"The material in this book is absolute garbage. It is archaic, moronic, and totally incorrect. It is blatantly obvious that the authors know ABSOLUTELY NOTHING about horses and their behavior. This book should be removed from shelves and taken out of print for fear that some poor unsuspecting person might actually give credence to and/or try some of these medieval techniques. How horrible that someone can call themselves ""Dr."" and pass on information such as this. DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK! Anyone in today's horse society should know better and be smarter. If you want to help your problem horses, this book is not the answer. Sorry, I just can't say enough bad things about this book. I have always thought that books were precious, but I threw this one into my trash the day I got it. It made me angry that someone could recommend such terrible things to be applied to horses. It is shameful and criminal, in my opinion."
5,Ridge Route: The Road That United California,"Scotty's book gives us an in-depth look at the old road over the Tehachapi Mountains that scared even the most competent drivers. He was responsible for gaining recognition for this historic transportation route between the great San Joaquin Valley and the San Fernando Valley and Los Angeles. Scotty has compiled a wonderful collection of material to share with the reader. Through his words and photographs, he shows the reader the early means of getting from one area to the other via motor car and truck. It is an invaluable reference for anyone studying the great central artery of California."
4,Nice book,"I like the history of the old California roads. It is amazing that the original concrete is still on this road.Another book on historic California roads is ""California Highways by Ben Blow"". It is free in pdf format on [...]"
3,"Nothing but a ""Best Of"" for Roadrunner","With the exception of Cradle Of Filth, every band on this soundtrack is a Roadrunner artist. The tracks are O.K., nothing really great."
5,Hidden Treasures of Ancient Egypt,Love this book. Can't read enough about Egypt.I love to read books on Egypt and stories told bu DR HAWASS.
4,Classic British Pop,"Just like Clear Light and Skip Bifferty, Fat Mattress was a short lived band that made a strong impression with their great songs. With the rhythm section of Englebert Humperdinck's band and Noel Redding on guitar they put together a solid band.I liked ""Mr. Moonshine"", ""Magic Forest"" and ""Little Girl In White"" the most. There are a lot of influences at work here: Small Faces, Traffic, The Byrds, The Who. If you're gonna crib, crib from the best-it rubbed off on them because these songs are just great! Listen and you will be pleasantly surprised."
5,Electrix Illumination 2066-BK Florescent Gooseneck Lamp,"This disk lamp is terrific. I use it on my bookshelf to grow plants. I have had it for several years and have yet to change the bulbs. Only now, are the bulbs beginning to turn dark at the ends. The lamp is lit for at least 18 hours a day. It is one of the few desk lamps that I can find for this purpose and it has been great for my plants that grow under it. It may be ""old fashioned"" but it is very reliable and sturdy."
4,Good.,"Satisfactory, just what I wanted to order. I'm happy with it I recommend to order this from here. Sharp and solid."
5,Slighty better than Buck 110,"The Sheffield is very similar to the Buck 110 that I have carried for years. I like the thumb notches on the top of the blade. So far, it seems to hold a good edge (better than my Buck)."
5,Rock Solid,"I recently upgraded to a larger motorcycle (770 pounds) and thought it was a good idea to get heavier straps. I like that these are the `sling-type' - no plastic covered hooks around the handlebars.I also like the large handles on the ratchet assemblies - you can really crank these things down. With just the two straps on the handlebars I gave the bike a wiggle - the whole trailer rocked with it. We did a 2000 mile round-trip with no issues. We even lost a trailer tire tread at 80 mph. No blowout, but things were rocking for a few seconds. Absolutely no issues with the security of the bike.I would definitely buy these again."
2,motorcycle tie downs,"Expensive for what you get. If Iwas to start over, I would buy the looped soft tie downs and then a wide(2 in) set of regular ratchet tiedowns. First use they were checked after 50 miles and had to be tightened each time for every 50 miles until 200 miles. As a general contractor use tie downs almost daily and never encountered the first use stretch theses had. Had bike ratched down hard and after first 50 miles the straps were loose enough to allow wrap around to slip down handle bars which then allowed ratchet mechanism to scuff gas tank. First scuff and mark on paint on my 1600 2005 Vulcan Nomad since buying new. Bought these to tie down bike in new toy hauler, wife said we should get the actual motorcycle tiedowns. $300 to get scuff damage fixed. They did not slip on ratchet, they stretched about 2"" over length first time. On trip returning there was no movement."
1,Packaging Nightmare,"Anything that require heavy cutters to dismember the plastic packaging nightmare this came in is ridiculous. After plowing through that I find little or no instruction on usage and assembly but tons of safety admonitions which were obviously written by the legal department. The smaller set required tools to take it apart, if I didn't need it now I would return it."
4,Worked perfectly.,"I just got done using four of these to secure a Suzuki DL1000 on a Kendon 3-rail trailer for a trip from San Jose, California to Santa Fe, New Mexico. Total was a three-day drive of 1200 miles, give or take.Bottom line, the straps worked perfectly, with one exception. The snap-lock on one of the hooks bent a bit on the trailer tie-down point and had to be forcefully pushed back to release the hook, rather than gentle pressure with the thumb. (That's why it's down one star.)Some of the straps required slight (1-notch on the rachet) tightening after initial use, but that's to be expected with new straps.Overall it's a good set, and I'd definitely recommend them."
3,Pretty Good Value,"I like the straps, but had to trim them for my bike and trailer.Since using them, I have had to throw out two straps. One completely ripped and another is wearing so badly on the edges that I am afraid to use it.The straps do the job, but if they are rubbing on anything, anything at all while tied to a motorcycle and trailer, they will wear really fast and in my case, actually cut in half."
5,Wonderful depiction,"I had to read this class for a course, and I am so glad that I did. It is a wonderful depiction of how life was for a Japanese woman during the late 19th century. It is a story of a strong woman who kept her life going no matter what got in the way. Enchi is a beautiful writer!"
2,Inconsistent,"A bit more difficult to use than I would have liked, and stops working at times. It has three settings - manual, automatic, and automatic deep cycle. It's not clear to me when to use which setting. Sometimes it stops charging in automatic mode, but if I switch to manual, it starts charging again."
5,Great Overview of Medieval Period,"Simple, straightforward text and pictures give a terrific overview of what was going on in the Medieval World. A jumping off place for getting more in depth. Maps and graphics are beautiful. The internet links are very helpful as well."
5,Be impulsive and buy this book!!,"This collection reprints the early adventures of DC's coolest new superhero -- Impulse!! Super speedster Barry Allen (The Flash) may be dead, but his grandson Bart lives on. Tranported from the 30th century to the present day, Bart must learn to cope with both his powers and the perils of the 20th century including (Gasp!) Junior High School! Helping him along the way is the mysterious Max Mercury. Bart always looks before he leaps and lands in all sorts of adventures. But it isn't just adveture that has made this comic so great. This comic is very character driven and it's easy to feel for Bart -- outside an outgoing, try anything sort, but inside misplaced and lonely. Plus, Humberto Ramos' art alone is worth the price of the book. Well, what are you waiting for? Be like Bart! Don't hesitate! Buy this book! Right now! Yes, right now!"
2,Not worth it,It comes with the puniest and stupid rock. I thought this was like an awesome coffee table book but its flimsy. Yeah it has pretty pictures and some advice but so does Google.
1,What a Ripoff,The 5 pages of useless advice and the included stone (which is smaller than their described perfect stone) are worth about a nickle at best.
2,Disappointing / Thank God,"While reading 'Industrial Society and Its Future' online, I am immediately struck by the sophist and hypocritical understanding of leftism. While discussing hidden inferiority and control of power the reader can't help but make psychological projections against the author. The man's biography is of much greater interest than this work. His struggle with a very complicated and layered self hate (that I see in this essay) may very well be the result of CIA experiments he underwent (during the 60's) while a genius student at Harvard.'The Information Bomb', by Paul Virilio is an exciting viewpoint for those concerned about technology's (and less explicitly, the left's) assault on humanity."
2,He is no Karl Marx,"Note to one of the previous reviewers: Even those with double-digit IQs know that ""pure genius"" is not a single word. The discusion of the ""leftish"" is mildly interesting. Ted never quite clarifies how sending bombs to a few isolated victims contributes to the achievement of the natural utopia he espouses. He also draws many conclusions based on his own somewhat distorted impressions rather than any sort of historical fact - he acknowledges this in conclusion, but that doesn't make the conclusions any more valid."
4,Perfect for My Use,"After shopping for Karaokes, I purchased this unit to amplify my son's voice (via mic) while playing the guitar. Didn't really need a karaoke. Unit has ample power with some to spare. I really like the design and controls. Only drawback was the speaker set-up, which really wasn't a big deal. Instead of connecting each speaker to connectors in the back, you connect one channel of each speaker to the unit (based on total Ohm resistance) and connect the speakers to each other with the other channels! Had never done that before, even with mono systems. It works though. Would recommend for amplifying up to 2 microphones. Good product at a good price."
1,Does not work,"Purchased one unit and it did not work at all. Returned it for another one, and it had something loose inside and the sound was intermittent. No problem with Amazon to return it. Amazon is good to deal with."
4,Beautiful Twisted Night -- Words from heaven!,"Marc is an amazing lyricist and poet, and this book offers the best of both. A must for any true gutterheart."
4,Nice work from a gifted mind,"I was introduced to Marc Almond when I was in high school. I found him to be dark, disturbing and amazingly insightful. Beautiful Twisted Night is nothing less than I expected from someone who makes me both afraid of myself and thrilled to be alive. His poetry is forceful, brave and original. It's nice to hear a voice that inspires respect, not by pandering to the poetic mainstream, but by being exceptionally candid."
3,didnt work on my giant dent,my friend rubbed her passenger side of the car on a pole in the parking lot. this suction cup thing is really strong unfortunately it really doesnt work on dents with creases. for the price it was worth a shot. im sure itll come in handy in the future for other dings
3,Is what is advertised,This is a good product. Just don't buy it thinking it will pull out any dent on any surface. It works OK on spaces where it can catch but anything contoured it does not work as well.
1,Did not work for me,Does not pull out a dent on a curved bumper. Would only work on a flat door panel or hood.
3,Dent Puller Review,"I bought this to try and pull a dent out of my metal garage door and it did not work. I thought it was air pressed, but overlooked what I was buying. It may work on flimmsy materials, but I guess my door is to thick."
1,not what I expected,I had a dent in my car and it didn't do anything for it. it would just suction cup it but not really pull it out. I was let down. not worth it. I don't recommend.
1,Not good a pulling dents,"This should be labeled a glass carrier because thats what it was made for. To carry large flat object that it can suck on to. I tried it on several car dents and the suction cup it way to big to pull most dents. It would only work for very large, very flat dents."
1,Does Not Work... Don't waste your $$$,"The suctioning cup does not remove large or small dents. A rip off. Although it does hold a good seal, I wouldn't trust it to lift things either. Move on..."
2,Did NOT fix my problem,"I purchased this to fix several small dents on my car (some on doors, some on hood)Guess what..... NOT ONE dent was removed with this, it puller the metal alright but did not pul the small dents one bit.DO NOT PURCHASE FOR SMALL DENTS! WASTE OF MONEY!"
2,It's Not What I Thought,"I read a lot of good reviews on this product, but it did not do it's intended work on my car. The suction was great, but I further dented my car trying to make this thing work. I wasted money on this product. Just go to a body shop and get your car fixed. This will not work IMHO."
2,Needs a large flat surface to work,"I bought this based on reviews after someone banged into the the corner of my rear bumper. The box it came in said it was a dent puller, but the instructions (for the same exact item) said it was for carrying panes of glass. I'm sure as a glass carrying tool it would be very effective, but unless you've got 5 inch diameter of flat surface to adhere it to, it's not going to stick. I could adhere it to my car door or my trunk lid, but could not get it to stick to any part of the dent on my bumper even after trying for over a half an hour. I was so frustrated I almost took a rubber mallet to it to see if making the dent even bigger would help, but I had enough sense not to try it.So for me, it was totally useless and $20 down the drain. If someone ever sits on the hood of my car, or if I ever have a large pane of glass to carry, I'm sure it will come in handy. For what I bought it for it was worthless."
3,Dent Puller,purchased the NI Dent Puller to get a dent out of the fridge; it left a big circle around the dent and I was not able to pull it out
1,Could not pull my dent out,"I give this product a total of 3 stars because it could work in some situations, but was unable to remove my dent. I deducted another star for the high shipping cost, which was so that they could include a large catalog. And I deduct a second star because the product did not come with proper instructions."
3,Not for transporting glass windows,"As its name implies this is for dent pulling. For transporting glass windows the HOD , handle-on-demand, on Amazon is the instrument of choice, because extra stable/providing maneuverability. This suction cup for dent pulling has a valve in the middle which allows easier removal of the cup ( just pull on it). That valve is not a push-vacuum pump unlike other suction cups. I have not used it for dent pulling yet ; its suction is very strong though. I surmise I could use it to lift and better fit slabs of marble, granite or quartz during installation on floors/counters, etc."
5,Very Good,The large soft rubber suction cups conform better and have stronger suction than two other competitors that I have tried.These are strong.
3,Doesn't work for small dents,"The dent needs to be big for this to work at all, like one made by a kick on a car door. I bought this to remove small dents on the stainless steel refrigerator, and I didn't see how this could possibly work on those. Then I tried this on a large dent on my car. It worked, but the surface wasn't nearly as smooth as before the dent. Maybe I expected too much. It looks a lot nicer though."
4,"Works as expected, but need strength","I got a huge dent on side of my door and tried using this product to fix it, or at least make it look better. I got some of the dent out and still working on rest of it. Meanwhile, few issues/tips.1. You definitely need a good amount of strength to use this! Also, wearing gloves help since it puts a lot of strain on your fingers as you're pulling with all your might (in my case anyway).2. The dent doesn't come out at once in my experience. So, you have to use it several times to get it out.3. Clean the surface of the dent for better suction. I haven't tried it yet, but slightly dampening might improve the suction as well."
4,Works as expected,"Had a soccer ball sized dent from backing into a pole - on rear bumper pass-side at the curve of the bumper. The dent puller pulled this out, it was creased (the dent ) which when pulled out left a remainder: a linear ""ding"". This I believe is due to the location of the dent on a curved portion of the bumper.However, for $30 (including tax & shipping) it did what it was expected to do very well. A bit of touch up paint and looks like a small ding/ cart accident - before was a crater (soccer ball sized, apx 3 inches deep at maximum depth).For comparison to future shoppers this bumper is fiberglass composite. (Not rubber/ metal)Prior tried the plastic suction which would not stick (also by Northern supply).Overall - recommend if you do not want to drop upwards of $800 on a perfect repair. Will not fix cosmetic problems like scratch or remainder crease but will make a large dent less horrific. Overall saves about $150 off a sloppy pullout job."
3,Just OK,This item was delivered as promised but is really big and not very useful for pulling smaller dents. I thought overall it was just OK.
3,"Shrank my dent, but still need professional repair","I backed my minivan into my gate post and ended up with a large dent (about a foot long) on the side of the van. At first the dent puller gripped well and pulled the dent out a little (after putting a lot of muscle into it) on either side of the puller. The dent shrunk to maybe a handswidth, but once the dent was smaller than the dent puller, the dent puller could no longer get a grip on it to pull it out. I'm not sure if this was because the dent puller couldn't pull out anything smaller than its own circumference, or if it was the odd placement of the remaining dent on the vehicle. This product made my dent a little smaller, but the dent will still need to be professionally repaired. That said, it's been months and we still haven't repaired the dent, so maybe the reduction in size of the dent made us more comfortable with delaying professional repair."
4,Pulls out the big but not the smaller dents,"I was tired of looking at the dent on my car and decided to give this dent puller a try. As soon as it arrived (and it arrived right on time), I pushed it against the dent and pulled. Most of the dent disappeared immediately. Unfortunately, the part of the dent close a metal seam would not pull out. Recommendation: Use this if the dent is just an indent and the metal did not actually bend."
2,Did not work for me,"This suction dent puller did indeed pull out my 15"" shallow dent, but as soon as I let the suction loose, it popped back in. I repeated this several times to try to figure out if I was doing something wrong. Do I need a larger dent puller? Not sure! But the dent puller is amazingly strong. Cannot figure out how to get the dent to stay out. Not sure why it pops back in. Anyone have any advice? Thanks!"
4,GreaT!!!!!!,"this dent puller pulled my dent out in 2 seconds i couldnt stop smiling from it and im glad i invested every penny into it. i advise anyone to buy this for medium to large dents, but not small, but other than that its awesome! TWO THUMBS UP! =)"
2,not a dent puller by any means,This is not a dent puller by any means but I guess it would be decent at picking up glass.....
3,Not Pro-Grade But Good,Bought for a autobody man in training. He thought there would be some used for it.
1,DOES NOT WORK-- Not meant for dent removal!,This product is meant to hold up/transport glass. It is not meant for pulling a dent out of metal. Tried it on several dents on my car and IT DOES NOT WORK. There are several other products on Amazon specifically for dent removal so I'd advise you to try one of those before this product.
4,Good suction.,"Good suction power, good handle, good de-suction mechanism. The reason why i gave only 4 stars is bcoz you can repair only large dents with it. They should have included smaller ones for small dents which is very common on vehicles."
4,Dent Puller Works Well With Limitations,"Heavy-duty, well-made, especially for the price. Works best on wide & shallow dents, tho it takes a lot of strength -- but that's because it works. A clean, wet surface is best, but that also means a tendency to slide off the target at the last moment. I would buy it again for large dents without grooves."
3,not whatiyhough it was,"good carrier anyway .. probably would work on large dents in the middle of your car trunk or door or where there's more give in the metal itself, or you're superman.. like I said.. good carrier for unwieldy metal, plastic, glass items..."
1,Not worth a penny!,"I bought this product hoping to pull a dent, not to hear it pop. Every time I tried to pull on a dent it would pop off and nothing happened. It may be a good carrier for glass, but this is not a dent puller and not worth anything I spent on it."
3,"good, but","works great for me, i have yet to use it a lot but at first my psp would keep shutting off on me after like 15 minutes, and i assumed this was because the battery is a slightly smaller fit than the original so by adding in some paper or napkin to make it tight i have no problems and it lasts longer than my original battery."
3,Its a battery,"I got this after making a Pandora battery out of my OEM battery. The battery works and all, but i feel like it doesn't last as long as the real thing. If you don't mind the shorter life than its good."
3,Much like Cathy C.,"I too thought this was a 3.6v 1800 mAh battery so I ordered one and even paid to have it over nighted, but I was given a 3.6v 3600mAh battery.... but i dont care because 3600's last twice as long as 1800's"
3,not a true sony battery,If you want a true Sony psp battery do not buy this.I received this battery it was in a world of warcraft looking box.It's cheap but the shipping is to much. Buy this at a retail store.
5,Works fine,It's a battery. It works fine in my first generation PSP. It was cheaper than many others. I am happy. Buy it if you need a new battery for your PSP.
2,A little disappointed.,"I can't say I was too disappointed because of the low price, but the battery only lasts about an hour or so. It does charge quickly because it dies so soon though. So, if you're looking for a battery that lasts long, I wouldn't suggest this one at all. I guess it is good for a back up though."
1,False advertisingItem received not item advertised,"The battery ad shows a 3.6V 1800mAh battery, its even branded into the battery in the picture. I ordered 2 of them and both are 3.7V 1800mAh batteries with plain black fronts. False advertising. I didn't know until tried to use them, no longer have packing materials or else would send back."
3,It's a battery,"It's a battery, did what it was supposed to and nothing more. As far as that goes though, it's a good battery and hasn't given me any trouble (the original one broke turning it into a pandora). I guess I would recommend it to others but you really can't be too enthusiastic about a battery."
3,disappointing,Great quality as usual for Jockey products. But I don't like the fit. They seem to run small. I much prefer the French cut style.
5,The best DnB album ever???,"I'm completely blown away by this album! It is by far the most ""musical"" DnB album I've ever had the pleasure to listen to. REAL world-class jazz musicians jamming to ultra-smooth drum and bass beats! How often do you hear that??? Upright bass, sax, flute, keyboards, smokin' hot vocals, and a ""smooth as silk"" DnB groove. It doesn't get any better than this! I'm VERY picky about the music that I listen to, but on a scale of 1 to 5, I'd easily give this a 6! Without a doubt, this is drum and bass at its absolute finest."
4,this band is moving up,in clover is a great band my ex girl friend ashlie's brother is the drummer the singer was in duckie and they are just a great band to look forward to see coming up in the emo scene and i just saw them on Feb. 15th and they were great.!..
5,"The disabliity experience, good book","I'm, Girard Sagmiller the author of the book Dyslexia My Life (ISBN: 096430871-1) . The book The Ragged Edge, is one of the top book for find out about living with a Disability, great for anybody feeling as if they are the only one dealing with this or for someone working with a disability group.. Thanks.."
4,Fascinating facts on the battle after the 1983 Fire,"This a great reference book for those interested in the mystery of the LBH. The digs followed a grass fire that provided an opportunity for archaeological excavations. Helps lend credence to the accuracy of markers, IDs the 40 odd bogus markers with Custer and indications of cause of death and mutilations based on skeleton remains. Also lends proof that the latter burials were haphazard at best and guess work at identifying the dead. Great gems in the possible identification of the scout Mitch Bouyer and a trooper skeleton far from the field that may have been trying to escape. Great detail on weapons used and provides evidence that the Indians had significant fire power with repeaters. Also, covers Reno-Benteen field and provides detail on possible military and Indian positions. Deep ravine is still a mystery, why couldn't remains of the 28 fallen troopers be found? If you have a Custer library, this is a great book to have."
4,Great scientific archeological analysis of the battle,"This book goes into great detail about the archeology performed on the battlefield site. It has the feel of being written for an audience of archeologists rather than just a casual reader. If you are an archeologist, the book probably rates a five. If you are really interested in the battle, I also recommend it. If you just want to learn the basics of the battle, howver, other titles are probably more appropriate."
4,"Lots of Gayaneh, why not record the whole ballet?","You'd think if anyone was going to bother recording three separate suites from a ballet, they'd go ahead and record the whole ballet. Unfortunately not. But to Naxos' credit, this particular recording is fairly comprehensive, touching on most of Khachturian's ideas and thematic material. After a long search, I finally located a full 2-CD recording of the ballet with the USSR Radio and Television Large Symphony Orchestra under Djansug Kakhidze on the Russian Disc label. The ballet in its full context is beautiful, whereas the suites turn the pieces into small, individual concert pieces (Sabre dance is the epitome of this). Does the ballet really need to be cut into large suites in order to salvage the music, or will the recording industry one day realize the demand there is for a full, attainable Gayaneh recording? While the suites are nice, hearing the ballet in its context and entirity is essential to the Khachaturian lover."
3,Amazon buyers be warned.....,"Buyers be warned...if you love this music as I and the other critics here seem to, read Eric S. Kim's review. He's got it exactly right...So why do ""I"" give it only three stars? - Because these 'bleeding chunks' which Naxos has issued are POORLY PLAYED, that's why, - and the only thing which can be said for RCA's disgracefully engineered recording of the entire score is that it is that the (English) National Philharmonic Orchestra plays it beautifully from what little can be heard, and the score is magnificently interpreted by Loris Tjeknavorian.The truth is this wonderful ballet score deserves better. If RCA apparently cannot restore the masters of their recording of the complete score, done by one the greatest recording teams in history, then somebody else should so justice to ALL of this great score. What Naxos has done here will not suffice."
3,Sizing an issue,"These tights are very cool, but be careful of the sizing. My skinny 7 year old usually wears 4-6 size tights from the Children's Place so I figured I'd buy the small in these. They were no where near long enough!! We didn't have time to return them, so I ended up cutting off the toe and used them more like leggings. She wore black socks and short black boots so it ended up working out okay."
3,Way Too Small,"I am small for my age and I purchased these for a ""Scar-let"" costume. Even though I am small, these were way too small. I couldn't pull them up. The Skulls look very scary and mean. I'm 9 and I wear a 4/5 6/6x and mostly 7/8. We had to cut the feet off."
3,Size does matter,"I purchased these tights for my daughter for Halloween. They were ok for one-time wear, but just barely. The print on them was marginal, and the rings around the legs didn't really match up at the seam. I bought a size small, which based on their sizing is what she would have taken, and they were far too small. Considering my daughter is small for her age, that was pretty disappointing. Still, for under $5 they're fine for an hour or two of trick-or-treating."
4,The sound of Miles Davis,"This is a great album for Marcus Miller. Obviously all the funky grooves he uses on this CD sound like a continuation of his music with Miles Davis; Michael Stewart contributes muted trumpet in Davis's Style; Marcus Miller's Electric bass is a MAJOR force throughout the entire album; Sounding times like a real bass and times like a great funky soulful guitar.If you are into some Bass/ Funk, Pop, Jazz and Fusion; or if you are into Miles Davis's Music with the extra bass sound; this album will be a real treat."
5,A MASTERPIECE!,"From start to finish, one of the most timeless jazz/blues/r&b albums and a favorite among my collection. A must-have for anyone who appreciates the work of a true master and enjoys a few ""tales"" from the more famous masters, along the way."
5,Very handy,Best Thermos we have purchased in a long time. Works great and my husband loves the rubber grips on the bottle.
3,Oh the drama.,These people are full of themselves. For a group of individuals on a spiritual quest I found these people very selfish.
3,Music for sorrow.,"I was told about this symphony by a friend. I listend to it once and it was good, but probably not one I will listen to again until something sad happens in my life. The first part was good--all strings for the most part if not all--I can't remember for sure. One of the subsequent movements (I can't remember if it was the the second or last one) just went on and on and on playing the same thing. I felt like saying, ""Get on with it--either end the piece or develop a new melody at least."" It will be good to play the first part when there is significant loss--perfect for that."
4,"Excellent vocals, beautiful music, tempo a tad slow","Having played the Upshaw version enough times to burn a hole in the CD, my sensibilities for this piece have been certainly biased. However, I find Kilanowisz's approach (on Naxos) more powerful in it's natural, non-operatic style. It is the pacing of the orchestra that lets me down in the Naxos recording. The subtle nuances as this music shifts from one theme to the next are done so beautifully on the Elektra release that, for me, the superior direction of the London Sinfonietta outweighs the exquisite singing of Zofia Kilanowicz. Both versions are worth having though and the second movement of the Naxos rendition is perhaps the most transcendental 10 minutes of music I've ever heard. Because I love this symphony so much, I'm sure I'll buy other recordings of it and I can't wait for the opportunity to hear it live."
3,party Time,"i'm a little surprised to see comparisons to Throbbing Gristle and Nektar in the reviews on this site...not good reference points at all, in my opinion. but, the music of Faust has never been easy to pin down. it contains so many different elements, but then again, hardly any at all. a very confusing band with a counfounding sound that is not without it's charms. this album has some spectacular playing and alot of really cool calculated german atmosphere. i like some of the more fuzzed out numbers like ""Don't Take Roots""; which sounds like a lost track from The 13th Floor Elevators. the intense and hyptonic shuffle of ""Munic B"" is also a standout cut. this is probably not a crucial krautrock album, or an essential Faust record; but definetly an enjoyable one."
1,died after about three nights...,"Don't get me wrong: I absolutely LOVE my Jetboil and after 40 years of backpacking, canoe camping and bike touring I think it is the best cooking system I have ever had, BUT this is the third igniter I have gone through in one summer! I bought this for my bike trip in September and it failed after three nights camping. I replaced it with one I bought at REI and it failed after four or five meals...I sure wish they'd design/build these a bit more robust.If you own a wonderful Jetboil my advise is to be sure to take a couple lighters..."
4,Medieval magic and genies--all in a love story.,"Propelled by the mystical forces of the djinn, genies who materialize when needed, this medieval romance of Lady Alura and Connor Warrick will capture the attention of readers looking for something different. Alura was destined to marry Connors brother Morvyn until he died of a sudden fever. Connor is reputed to be a bad man, but turns into the lover of Aluras dreams. This is her soul mate, the man she will rely on for security and protection. Alura is kidnapped for the fire opals that bring the djinn to life, and Connor comes to her rescue. Their moments alone are electrifying. Hallam knows how to make the slightest touch riveting. Her ability to get inside the mind of a medieval woman in jeopardy is thrilling."
4,Awesome hair product,"I have thick, coarse hair and have used many different hair products for my hair to try and control it and this one works the best so far for my hair type. An added benefit is that it doesn't irritate my scalp."
5,Noel Redding could play guitar too!!!,"This great debut album from Fat Mattress has proof that the late Noel Redding could play some serious guitar not just bass (like He did with Jimi Hendrix)!!! This is a classic album!!! Magic Forest is the highlight but the rest of the tracks are great also. Traffic's Chris Wood plays flute on the song All Night Drinker. The other band members are great too,Eric Dillon's drumming is awesome(He is now an airline pilot!),so is James Laverton's bass and keyboard playing and Neil Landon's vocals!!! A true class act!!! Two thumbs up!!! A+"
5,delightful pieces and delightful performances,"No. 64 is a slight affair with an especially tender slow movement. Though faster than Dorati and Philharmonia Hungarica (nla), Bella Drahos still manages to bring out the expressiveness finely. No. 84 is one of the ""famous"" Paris symphonies and second only to the ""London"" symphonies in maturity of expression. No. 90 is slightly later and has a spirited, lengthy Menuet, worthy of note. Clear, excellent recorded sound prevails in all."
5,Really helps with focus,"As I scanned the shelves in my high school's library, I ran across this book. It sounded just weird enough to pick up. I read it, and it really helped me. I took the SAT the following Saturday and I used the techniques to be able to focus. It's an easy read and definitely worth your time."
3,DHS SHAMPOO,"USED IT FOR YEARS AND DOES RELIEVE THE SCALP SOMEWHAT, BUT EVENTUALLY YOU NEED TO SEE A DOCTOR TO GET COMPLETE RELIEF. THE PRODUCT ONLY WORKS AS A TEMPORARY RELIEVER TO SCALP PROBLEMS AND DOES NOT HEAL SCALP IRRITATIONS, WHICH MUST BE TREATED BY A DERMATOLOGIST IN THEIR OFFICE."
1,Burns Skin When Left On Too Long,"I like to add shampoo to my hair first thing during a shower and leave it on while I continue to shower. Then the last thing I do is rinse the shampoo off my hair. So the shampoo has about 10-15min contact with hair/scalp/skin around hair. This product when left on skin too long maybe 10-15min, will start to burn the skin. I got a chemical burn from this shampoo."
4,Finally!,"I have psoriasis on my scalp, which means I get itchy sores on my scalp. My hair is thick enough that no one can see them, but the itch is always there. I have tried every coal tar shampoo I can find. Usually when I find one that I like, it gets taken off the market. It seems that the only coal tar shampoos available in pharmacies don't work well and are horrible for my hair.In desperation, I went online to see what I could find. I got very lucky in my choice to try DHS. It lathers really nicely; I don't have to use a lot of shampoo. It doesn't smell bad, which is the best that can ever be said about coal tar shampoo. Most importantly IT WORKS. My scalp and hair haven't been this healthy in years.I'm a convert. This is my shampoo from now on. Please, please, please don't stop producing it."
4,Great shampoo,"This shampoo was one of several on my dermatologist list,which was prepared for my allergies.I found it to be one of the mildest yet effective dandruff shampoos I have ever used."
3,Buy the scented!!!,This non-scented shampoo smells exactly like gasoline! I HIGHLY recommend you buy the scented one! It does the job though... I don't have any flakes or problems with my scalp anymore.
5,your search for music that never dies has ended with felt,"this cd is wonderful,flowing,inspiring,beautiful,and mesmerizing. Great for a lazy sunday afternoon and a must have for any real music collector!!!!!!!! i love this cd it brings me back to the old days of highschool in fl. me and best friend would sit in her room and listen to felt's albums great memories. DO INVEST IN THIS CD"
3,C+ FOR SOUND..C+ FOR PERFORMANCE A+ FOR VIBE,I only know felt from this C.D. only.On the surface and first listen it's the vocals that have a sort of disposable quality that is either a turn off or somehow flip the other way and suck you in.It's a funny and perplexing problem as it all fits together with the mood of the backing music music.Are these songs?...or just outburst of energy?Mood fits.?I almost threw this CD out the window 7 years ago but stumbled on it and discovered it's really weird to have this on in the background.It's so non-discript yet totally discript.It has a sort tinny thin sound to the overall production that sounds a bit bright.
5,simply brilliant,"i first heard this album back in the eighties. a friend of mine dubbed me a copy on cassette and i listened to it like crazy. of course, the days of cassette are long gone, and i stopped listening to my copy, but i never forgot about it. for whatever reason, i never replaced it on cd either; that is until now. honestly, for the past, what--15 years or so--since i was listening to that cassette in my car, songs from this album would randomly pop in my head. it is wonderfully catchy, mystifyingly moving, and just brilliant. after listening you may wonder if there could have been a belle and sebastian without felt. just can't say enough. and it is true that felt is the kind of band wherein you either love them or hate them--but then all the best things seem to be that way, aren't they?"
3,Pretty Good but not their best by far,Felt1. Forever Breathes The Lonely Word2. Splendor of Fear3. Strange Idol Patterns4. Me and A Monkey on the Moon5. Pictorial Jackson Review6. Ignite the Seven CannonsBuy Accordingly
2,Cheese,"This is a small (low budget) cheese ball movie with a 70s style and feel.Some corny action sequences with some really funny special effects, but.....didn't hold my interest. Lots of hot girls in the movie but still no grip.Kind of odd, kind of entertaining but not worth the money."
5,A wonderful book!,"I really enjoyed this novel. If you like to read Christian fiction, then this is one you don't want to miss. I found it hard to put down. This is one of my favorites, and I'd give it more stars if I could!"
3,One channel cuts in and out,"The build of this cable is fine and the 1/8 to 1/4 converter being stored on a holder on the cable is a great idea (plus 1 star for that). The reason for the low ranking is that the cable I have has a bad connection at the jack end. Wiggling the cable causes a channel to cut in and out.I am buying another cable, not this one."
5,MR. MARCUS,...THIS IS MARCUS MILLER. I DARE SAY THAT THE BROTHER CAN DO NO WRONG - MUSICALLY! IF YOU LIKE MARCUS COP EVERY ONE OF HIS ALBUMS FOR MAXIMUM ENJOYMENT.
5,Love this CD !,"The CD is magnificent! It came on time, if not earlier than expected and was in great shape. I would not hesitate to order from Streetlight Records again."
5,Best Bass Guitar Album since the Jaco/Stanley Dayz...,"Actually this is a great record PERIOD! No gimmicks, fluff, or needless flash, just good music by arguably the most well-rounded bass guitarist out there. Every note Marcus plays has relevance and purpose; you can tell he's not playing just to impress or make the listener say 'Wow, how did he do that?' Its just MUSIC...featuring a BASS PLAYER. Fat, Buttery, Thick, Funky, whatever you want to call it, its still ALL THAT with Imagination. Miles, Luther Vandross, Roberta Flack, David Sanborn; they all knew what's up, now its your turn. Help put the sterotypes to rest; horn players and guitarists aren't the only cats who play good music. 'The Sun Don't Lie' is undeniable proof of that."
3,Khachaturian's ballet Spartacus,"I had a recording for this ballet from the library, and it consisted of 2 discs. I gave it a 2 rating because I do not believe that it is complete. I was listening tonight to a recording of Spartacus on King Fm, and it just stopped in the middle. I would prefer the one with 2 discs. The music is so different and the duet with Spartacus and Phrygia is one of the most beautiful I have ever heard. Let me know if you get this ballet with 2 cd""s. I would love to own a cd and see this ballet done by PNB. Thank you. Liane Newman"
3,"Amen, brother","To all other reviewers of Spartacus and Gayane: I feel your pain. Everyone wants to have the complete 2 disc sets to these magnificently beautiful ballets. I once had an unabridged version of Gayane by the Moscow Symphony Orchestra that was recorded in 1979 for vinyl and then subsequently put on CD. Mine was stolen in a burglary and now you can't find it anymore. I bought the unabridged 2 disc Spartacus from Amazon back in about the year 2000. It was also stolen, and again, unable to find it anywhere. If anyone finds them, let others know where. Until then, keep bugging Amazon and others until they realize how much we really want these CDs. The recordings are out there, they are just not being sold to the public. I'd pay almost anything for them."
5,A-List...HOT series,"Some Like it Hot the 6th book in the series is not a let down. I personally loved it and anyone who is reading this series should read it(read them in order).Zoey Dean does it again with a plot full of scandal, intrigue about the life of the rich and the fabulous. Anna and Ben are together and in love(however houseguest Maddy might get in the way of that), Dee is doing quite well considering her nervous breakdown, Sam has Eduardo, and Cammie finds out a secret about her mom's death that is shocking.I cant wait for the next one which is sure to be just and good."
3,I didn't like it hot.,"Ah, following closely behind Gossip Girl, The A-List as well has finally lost its spark. Not only are the situations predictable and the dialogue choppy and (big surprise) CORNY, the whole direction of the story continues to head into rocky waters. I find myself caring less and less about the characters I was once intrigued with. Even Anna is making me shake my head and mumble misgivings. I mean how long can one possibly stretch out a YEAR in a series--The A-List is just as bad as Gossip Girl now. I enjoy the latest fashions as much as the next person. TRUST ME. But I need detailed descriptions of clothing that could probably feed a third world country for a year like I need a spork to my eye! Though I cant promise I myself wont be picking up the 6th book at my local library when it comes out I recommend anyone who hasn't yet indulged in the series head elsewhere. Try the It Girl--it's fresh and exciting."
3,A bit of a let down,I have been a fan of the A-list series since it first came out and I love all of the A-list books including this one but it was a little bit of a let down compared to the previous books in the series. There was no amzing climax to the plot. The main plot of the story was getting ready for prom. The way the book ends leaves you wanting more and I will deffinately read the next book in the series but am hoping that the next book is better than this one.
5,THIS AND NO OTHER IS THE PERFECT,"CUISINE RECIPES BOOK !Jus bring it home and your table will be a perpetual celebration!The recipes are easy to prepare, the dishes look GREAT and your palate goes crazy with joy !"""
3,"Very basic book, not updated to new techniques...","This book is a very basic book. I found it not so helpful in the way that the information contained in the book isnt updated to the new techniques. Plante has never used the most popular NHL style ( the V style, butterfly) so its a big lack even if he has a few pages on it. The information is sometime unclear, not necessarely well write. Some things are repeated many times. So, I you buy this book, its OK. But dont rely ONLY on it. BUY other more modern books that are concious of today goaltending."
4,Great Knives,"I love these knives. By far, the best set I've ever owned. Way better than the Rachel Ray knives. Only con is, Amazon shipping was slow. I didn't get them until AFTER Christmas."
4,"Sweet, insightful, and well crafted","I received this book as a companion gift to the first Noah benShea book in this series, Jacob the Baker. Both volumes complemented one another, and I recommend reading them in sequence. They are both exceptionally quick reads.The lightness of the text, however, is deceptive. benShea's writing style is outwardly simple, but every word is well chosen. Each chapter functions as a sort of mini-parable. With minimal language, he creates beautiful imagery and strings along a series of profound philosophical observations.Because these books have a decidedly jewish flavor to them, their reading audience will likely be limited. That's too bad. These are precisely the kind of books that most readers regardless of religious persuasion will revisit periodically throughout life."
4,For Meatloaf Fans,"This CD is for Meatloaf fans. Most all of the titles are well known and familiar from the ""Rocky Horror Picture Show""I really like this CD."
3,A Loaf of Meatloaf,This is a two CD set.Disc One has 17 songs. Bat Out Of Hell is in it's edited form from 9:49 minutes to 4:56 minutes. More Than You Deserve is also edited with a fade out at nearly 4 minutes. All other songs from Bat Out Of Hell are the album version. The rest of the CD contains Meatloaf's later hits in the 80's and they are all in their single version formats.Disc Two has 4 songs live from Bat Out Of Hell:Bat Out Of HellYou Took The Words Right Out Of My MouthTwo Out Of Three Ain't BadParadise By The Dashboard LightAll in all it's a great CD if your looking for Meatloaf's hits into the 80's. No other Meat Loaf compilation has as many singles from the 80's paired with all his asingles from Bat Out Of Hell.
5,A Fine Gila Wilderness Primer,"The kind of ""excellence"" described in the author's (excellent) introduction pervades this detailed guide. Historical anecdote is meticulously intertwined with drily philosophical musings on the uneasy relationship between cow, cowboy and trout. Tips for fly types and sizes,line weights, rod lengths and other technicia may seem somewhat cursory,as the author's great affinity is not for technique and equipment but for the wild trout he has caught here. There is a certain ""reading between the lines,"" necessary to get full benefit from this book -- in this way it can be as rewarding (or frustrating) as what is sometimes called literature."
2,Don't know what all of the hype is!,"I don't know if it was because the author himself really thought this was a good book, or if it was because I had other things on my mind while reading it. Rex Johnson is a fair writer, and does provide interesting information at times. However, I found myself falling asleep, slobering while I was reading it. I guess fly fishing is not for me! Illustrations in the book are up to par. If you like fly fishing, maybe, borrow it before you think about buying it. Really!"
2,"Decent playing, but this is thin gruel","Josef Bayer (1852-1913) is mostly forgotten today, but Die Puppenfee does survive at the outmost fringes of the repertoire. It follows a standard ballet recipe of toys coming to life, of course depicted through various dance numbers including a couple with ""local color"" (Spanish and Chinese). It is all very pretty, oversweet and thoroughly unmemorable. Same goes for the excerpts from Sonne und Erde, inconsequential, tepid and oversugared. I don't think I could under any circumstances possibly want to listen to it again. Andrew Mogrelia draws as good performances as one could reasonably expect from the Slovak Radio Orchestra, but it doesn't really help very much. And they even get good sound. No matter, this one is for the specialist."
5,Informative Book,My son in law read the book and passed the title on to me. It's a great quick read with information applicable in all areas of ones life.
4,review of New Deales War,"This was a well researched book --which does emphasize the negative aspects of FDR'spersonality and shows a much stronger , amoral , conniving aspect . -Also shows FDR's highly aware political nature and how so many of his decisions were made to enhance his politcal agenda -excellent read"
1,Wow...you right wing conservatives...lol,"Horrible book, put it down before I started. Would have given 0 stars if I could. It never ceases to amaze me that so many right-wing conservatives feel it necessary to bash perhaps our greatest president in the brief history of the US. Who do you people have to look up to, Junior (aka Dubbya)...lol...I feel sorry for you people...I suppose that is why the southern confederate sympathizers prefer your party, less thought required. Remember, in the famous words of your leader W., ""we must transition our world"" One wonders how you make transition a verb?"
5,On time great deal,On time great deal no problems totally completely satisfied with the text book I would buy from them again the future
3,management of a sales force,It was the wrong book - not send incorrectly on your part - we were told the wrong book. As far as Amazon was concerned you did everything great.
1,HASBRO FAILED ON THIS ONE!!!!!,"My 6 year old son received this game as a Christmas gift three weeks ago. This was his ""favorite"" toy until it started giving us trouble. First of all, week one it lost all volume. Then from that point on it has been slowly breaking all together, now it won't turn on. We tried all of the trouble shooting and changed the batteries twice, but no luck. Pretty sad toy for $50. Actually, terrible quality even at the sale price!!! Anyway, my 6 year old is very upset about this, and I thought we should give people a heads-up before your as disappointed at we are!!!!"
1,Only lasted one hour,"Super 1st hour of fun, then the game broke and was no longer usable. Gave same product to my sister and her son and husband had great fun with it. As far as I know, their's is still working."
4,"Fun for me, but not for my fiance","I bought this video as a starter for practicing for the wedding. We are both beginners to swing. I enjoy it and find it easy to learn from, but my fiance is having a harder time (maybe since he really does not like to dance!) He says that the steps are hard for him to follow. I think that they do a great job breaking down each step, showing the male version, then the female version, then together. The male instructor's pants are hilious and worth the money just for that!"
1,NOT THE BEST CATES BOOK BY FAR,"BASED ON THE PREVIOUS REVIEW I WAS QUITE ANXIOUS TO GET INTO THIS ONE. AFTER 2 CHAPTERS I JUST GAVE IT UP. CASS IS A SPOILED BRAT OF A GIRL AND AT AGE 15 A BIT OLD TO INNOCENTLY FIND HER DAD A WIFE.....NORAH IS A MOUSE AND KEEPS MENTALLY FLITTING OFF TO FANTASIES OF ROMANCE THAT SHE THINKS ABOUT AND WE'RE BORED WITH. THE HERO SOUNDS HUNKY AND SHOWS HIS VULNERABILITY RIGHT OFF BUT HE WENT FROM ""NEVER"" GETTING MARRIED TO ""COURTING"" NORA FOR THE GOOD OF HIS DAUGHTER IN 7 PAGES......TOO MUCH UNREALITY FOR ME SO I GAVE THIS ONE UP. IF YOU WANT A GREAT CATES BOOK, READ GATHER THE STARS FOR ONE. DON'T WASTE TIME ON THIS ONE."
5,Vows of Silence,"For many years the victims of Father Maciel sought justice only to find discredit, harassment, intimidation, embarrassment. Here is some testimony of the upsetting abuse suffered by many by someone they trusted and even loved. The manipulations of very powerful father Maciel and many in the Catholic Church whose main concerns were increasing their wealth and influence not the well being of idealistic, trusting, well intentioned young men. The evidence of the cult-like brainwashing of many. As one of the victims says ""it is difficult to know where madness ends and evil begins""."
1,Creepy,"My 2 1/2 year-old daughter really enjoyed this tape. But my husband and I found the narrator to be so creepy and bizarre we've permanently hidden it. The cartoonish set, jumpy characters in costumes and grating music were so at odds with the spirit of yoga practice that I could barely stand to watch it all the way through once."
1,Too Cheesy!,"This is hard to keep watching...the animals of the farm are ridiculous! The yogi is very talented but kinda hokey, too. I do NOT recommend this for any age. Kids ages 4 - 8 have watched bits of this and quickly lost interest."
1,What a joke!,I bought this video to begin yoga with my daughter and it was a huge disappointment. My three year old would not even watch for a minute.
2,Ei Ei Yoga - Major Disappointment,"We purchased Ei Ei Yoga based on the available reviews. The criticisms sounded picky; the praises indicated this would be fine for a three year old. The tape is not truly Yoga. In the first place we do not ""play"" Yoga, we practice it. Instead of starting gently, reaching a peak, and ending quietly, this video leaves a child highly stimulated and not particularly refreshed because there is no logical progression of activity. The tape is poorly edited and sometimes downright tasteless. The children are charming and enthused, but the video is neither."
2,Cheesy,"I really didn't like this video. I bought it together with Yoga Kids, which is wonderful. I found the songs and style of Ei Ei Yoga video so cheesy that I was embarassed to have my children watch it."
1,Ewww!,"The video was a mess from the beginning. The tape quality was extremely poor. The video had weird scenes like wind blowing very strong, I thought the kids would be blown into Oz. The instructor was performing poses that most children would not be able to do. The tone of the video was too strange for mainstream. I agree with the reviewers that called this video ""creepy""."
1,E-i E-i Yucky,"I completely agree with the other reviewers. This video is creepy and annoying. Not only that, the poses are difficult and inappropriate for young children."
5,My kids and I like this video,"I have this and ""Yoga Kids"" and we like them both. My children are now 11, 8 and 6 but we've been using this since they were 2, 4 and 7. My guys like to watch it, like the music, sing the songs on their own now and then and like doing the poses. ""Yoga Kids"" might be better for beginners or kids new to yoga but we like them both fine. I didn't find anything ""tasteless"" or ""creepy"" about this video. I think it's perfectly fine for kids and I would recommend it to other parents."
4,The other peson who rated this is an idiot,"This is a simple fishfinder that finds fish. Bottom line. And isn't that what a fish finder is all about. I can see a 1/2 o.z. jig at 120 feet with this exact model. It bugs me when people write reviews that just say,""It sucks"". What sucks (besides your stupid review)? Bottom line, try finding one for under 140.00 (slim chance). this is a good fish finder for the entry level fisherman who has never used electronics."
1,Poor Performer - Now Useless,"I purchased the Fishmark 320 to replace a very old, but functional late 1980's Microtrac 2800. The Fishmark display had very sharp resolution, but it ""found"" lots of phantom fish that weren't there. I had checked and re-checked the transducer installation according to the instructions, and it didn't help. Now, when powering up, the display comes up, it beeps a few times and shuts down. I've used it for maybe 5 hours, and it was less than useless all of that time. It wasn't an expensive unit, but I expected much better from Eagle/Lowrance than what I got."
1,I give it no Stars + 3 Black Holes,"I spent close to $300 at the time for this worthless, useless ""Eagle Fish-no-Mark 320"" junk.1. It won't work in temperatures over 95 Degs.2. Whenever a boat goes within 100 ft it goes nuts.3. It stops working all togeater for no reason.4. The print is to small to read on the display screen.5. It shows twigs as a fish.I use it to plug up the hole in my boat dash that I cut out to install it.I bought a $100 fish finder and it works better."
3,Victory by design Porsche,"Having bought the Ferrari edition of this series first, I was expecting the same depth of production and film quality in this edition. I was disappointed in the film quality,the collection of cars actually driven and the selection of historic footage. Still an interesting watch if you like the mark, but a far second to the Ferrari series."
3,Not as good as the others in the series,"I absolutely love the Victory By Design series. Most of the episodes feature Alain de Cadenet driving lots of the cars he discusses. This episode is strangely lacking in that key aspect. He discusses the cars extensively, they intercut interviews with key players in Porsche's racing history, but he only does a little driving.If your primary interest is in seeing a video that discusses Porsche's racing history at length, this episode will be perfect. It features a discussion of most of the significant milestones in Porsche competition cars and includes a lot of historical race footage.But if you're like me and most enjoy the segments in which Alain actually drives the cars, I'd skip this episode; while I admit I haven't seen the entire series, every other episode I've seen features many more cars being driven than this one does."
5,"This book creates its own world, a feeling of France in the 19th cent.","This is one of my favorite books in the whole world, not because of any one thing, but because of how its different parts hinge together to stand you right in the middle of a completely creative spirit. You can get lost in the pages and sense Monet's life. His gardens, the notes on food, the kitchen. It is a large book, perfect for a lap. Sit with it and list-making tools. Think of a kitchen in another time, when food was beautiful and flavors strong and true. I have made the green cake (vert-vert) and it was pretty good, amazingly pretty. The recipes chew at the back of your mind and then you find yourself making something from it on a rainy day when you have also bought flowers at the grocery. If you get this book you will probably buy flowers at the grocery from then on, and that will make you happy."
3,Monet's Table,The book had water damage all along the back upper jacket cover - not disclosed in description of product on Amazon.comOtherwise the product was to my satisfaction.
1,Beware of support problems,"VCom purchased the company that produced the original software. I was a happy user of SystemSuite 4. Within weeks of buying that company, VCom abandoned the old user base except for pitching their other software. This suite used to be updated almost weekly, sometimes more often if there were a lot of new viruses around.POOR UPDATING IS FATAL FOR ANTI-VIRUS SOFTWARE. There is little value to obsolete virus protection. The utilities aren't very special. I bought it for the integration.In the last year, I have never received one reply to my emails except a form letter asking for more purchases. ZERO UPDATES!IMHO, this company will take the money, chew up the user base until it's squeezed dry, then sell it to the next company. Check online reviews - System 5 is just version 4 with a few tiny little cosmetic changes. They're just starting up a new cash generator, that's all. I would not expect any more support from them for 5 than they gave to 4."
5,The BEST!!!!!!!!!,"I have used this product since 1999. Before I used Norton Utilities for a number of years. But it would crash and use a lot of memory. Then in about 1999-2000, I was looking for a good program that could run on different operating systems. This was great then. I only used Norton 2000 for antivirus. Now it has a better anti-virus program. The firewall has worked great. So this is a great multi-functional utility program. I love the fact that it is versatile with a firewall, zip, file manager, antivirus, etc. It is so good, it got PC Magazine Editor's Choice Award for 2002, and 2003. Another feature that is great, it has a bootable CDrom."
1,Very Dissapointed,"This product is not worth the money. They offer a too many what appear to be beta version of utilities. They are slow, system hogs and even outdate. I will not buy from this company again."
1,System Suite 5.0,"After reviewung some of the posts on this product and after seeing PC World's review of it in this month's edition, I decided to get this for my home computer. After the automatic install of all the other freebies and the regular install of the actual program, I couldn't open the appliction. Every time I clicked on the icon for the System Suite program, the little flashlight would pop up and search for the exe.file. Well, after about the 3rd install, and absolutely no help from the website, I'm taking the garbage back."
1,Don't Bother. Cheap for a Reason!,"I got this based on reviews in PC Magazine and PC World. VCOM must have paid quite a bit to these magazines to get such good reviews!So what is the problem?Well, to start the firewall fails to load upon startup. After manually starting the firewall (which I had to do everytime I started Windows) the firewall constantly asks if IE can connect to the web. It keeps asking even after you check the box and select Yes to stop the popup. Another popup is shown EVERYTIME you go to a new URL!The anti-spam and anonymous web surfing are not full versions and you are hounded to upgrade them for even more $!And last but not least, After installation Windows XP lags while shut down. The lag is around 15 to 30 extra seconds. It may not seem like a long time but it gets old quick.Don't bother getting this suite. Your computer will run better without it and there are better products on the market."
2,NOT real high quality,"Ive had this a couple of years and it really hasn't measured up. It can charge quickly but not fast, has no over charge protection, most of the parts are on the low end (ie wheels, handle, cables, clamps). It seems to be twice as large as it needs to be. But the 2 biggest issues with this is the poor performance of the 200-amp start and the cables literally melting every time you use it. I have used this 15 - 20 times over 2 years and the cables have ROTTED off. First the cable insulation would melt and smoke when I used the 40 or 200 amp settings, then, when I could see the wire I realized it was corroded and soon broke. Its obvious the cables were the cheapest they could get away with and thats just dangerous. It makes me question whats inside. I wouldn't mind all the trim being low end but when you cut corners with the core product thats just not safe."
5,nice tough charger,i use the charger all the time..works great and its pretty tough..it gets knocked around all scratched up forgotten outside in the rain and snow..keeps on workin !!the 200 amp will start stone dead car...the trickle charge will bring a battery back from the dead{depends on the battery's condition}...what else could you ask for ???
4,"Great unit, a few shortcomings, nothing critical","It does what it is supposed to do. It supplied cranking power to a dead battery on a flooded engine in below zero conditions, no problems. It lost a star for me because of the cables and clamps... they just went undersized and cheap on this and it's disappointing. But, even as they are, the unit did work great, far beyond my expectations. I think I read some other reviews about shipping damage. Mine came triple boxed, perfect condition."
1,charger use 3 times,This Charger went out does not work I've used it 3 times and it won't work anymore please replace it for a new one.
4,nice charger at a good price,"nice charger at a good price , charges 12 volt very nice i really like the 200 amp fast start when the battery is very low or you need to get some thing fired up and moving quick."
5,Excellent book!,"If you are a Dale Earnhardt Jr. fan, this book is for you! I have read this one and loved it. The pictures are wonderfully done. And believe me there are lots of them! The interviews and insights are great. You will love this book!"
4,Dale Earnhardt Jr Driving Force Of A New Generation,"I read this book and it was a great one. The interviews the author did on the other drivers and anouncers,that was a neat idea The pictures in the book were beautifully done. The information the book gave was perfect for what I wanted to know. I would recommend this book to anyone I knew! it was rally good. The author of ""Driving Force Of A New Generation"" did a wonderful job!"
4,"Very good, not great","A very good cordless phone/answering machine. Handset has a good, rugged feel to it, audio is fine, features are very good. There are many features in the phone and answering machine that you can set to make it work more like you want it. Reception is very good and it doesn't interfere with our wireless network.Not so good would be the poor display, limited choices for ringer volume (one seems too loud, the next too quiet), and poor placement of the volume control. Haven't cordless phone designers every used a cell phone? They could learn much from even an average cell phone's ergonomics. The wall mount is also poor. It doesn't mount flush with the wall, but sticks out from it (imagine it's on a shelf, without the shelf.)"
1,Rolling the Dice,Mine worked fine for about 6 months.The #4 key became problematic - having to push down on it twice as hard as all the other keys to key in a phone number.Called Panasonic Tech Support - they told me to just ship it back to them with a note describing the problem. According to the Tech support guy - they don't issue RMA #s.I'm timid about just shipping the product back this way - how do I know I'll ever get it or a replacement back?One would think that an organization as large as Panasonic would have a seasoned RMA system.These Chinese manufactured items are really driving the American Quality Standard down.Use to buy American made products and they'd last forever.Now we buy imported junk and we've learned to accept a 33% failure rate.Look what they are doing to our thinking. Way to go American Business Leaders.Someone should come up with a pure american products web store.Even Amazon should consider such a venture.
4,Interesting perspectives on creative thinking styles,"This book starts off a quick précis of the 5 faces : Seer, Observer, Alchemist, Fool, Sage. Then it gives a self-assessment of which Styles you are currently using. I scored highest on Fool & Observer, and lowest on Sage.As I read through the book, I was disillusioned as to its worth. But when I got to Fool, I thought ""that's me exactly"" (there's no shame in being a 'Fool' in this schema).So I looked back at the earlier chapters, and thought maybe the questions & examples were not as appropriate as they might have been?Anyway, I began to appreciate the book more. Certainly the latter sections on how to apply the 5 different styles at work, and the strengths & weaknesses of teams who find themselves with & without all these players, were of more use than the theorising.There are other books offering rival schemas, but I think this one is as good as any of the others, and easier to read."
3,Interesting presentation of personality characteristics,"I only read the first two sections of this book, but I did enjoy them. When purchasing this book, I was most interested in learning about the personality characteristics for each of the ""five faces of genius"". I found this aspect of the book very fulfilling. The author clearly presents unique qualities and behaviors associated with each ""face of genius"". This book supports the idea that, outside of hard work and dedication, there is more then one approach to creating valuable products."
2,Boring,This is not able to hold my baby's interest ... or mine...pictures are kind of confusing and muted.. its probably suitablefor an older kid who can read without help
3,Good insight into Hmong life and history,"This book gives an insider view of the Hmong people and helps you to understand how different generations of Hmong people differ in their culture. If you want to know anything about Hmong people, this is a good book to add to the readings. While this is only a snipet of information on the Hmong people, its a good book!"
2,Outdated,"The research presented here is limited in scope, naive, inexpert/amateurish, and increasingly dated. Reads essentially like a masters thesis. Not recommended."
5,An awesome album for fans of Megadeth and industrial rock!,"This is one awesome album. The original songs from Youthanasia are classic Megadeth, but the remixes of S.O.D. and H.W. are great songs for those who love Megadeth and industrial rock. What else could a band like Nine Inch Nails and Megadeth come up with but a great industrial song like Symphony of Destruction. I recommend this CD to any Megadeth fan."
3,Fairly comfortable but has problems,"I sort of liked this slipper as it has a solid rubber sole and a fairly comfortable feeling, but there are features that could be significantly improved. The material inside the slipper causes feet to sweat, my feet typically don't, but do in this slipper, and they certainly retain odor! Then when you wash them the interior sole falls apart. As a result I would recommend this slipper only to men who wear socks with their slipppers - I don't."
1,Not worth the money,"Though shipment and handling were very good, the Eurelle Clog Slippers are very uncomfortable. The sole of the slipper is so heavy it constantly pulls of the foot. I have owned clog slippers before, as well as Dutch wooden clogs and found them to be very comfortable, but these are far from that and I am going to donate to Goodwill. Sorry, but that is the truth."
3,These Run Small,I purchased these for my husband for Christmas and he is size 11 1/2 or 12 (typically the smaller). However they were too small and I had to return them. Never in his life has he worn a shoe larger than 12. So this is obviously an issue. Just beware. They seemed high quality but given the circumstances I didn't really give them a chance.
4,Good.,"I like it. I do get lost on the map, but It is still a fun game. :) I would recommend it to those who have a lot of patience."
3,What? Where?,"I was exited to play this game, being and Inuyasha fan and all, so I had to get this game. So I get the game, put it into my DS and start it up. It starts off easy enough, but as you get further into the game...which isnt too far I guess...and your left stumped on where to go next! The game is nicely done in the art department and fighting is easy, but knowing where your suppose to go next is not easy! They tell you the name of the village, but not where it could possibly be located so it was pretty frustrating to play, after a while.If your a die hard fan who loves Inuyasha and has to own everything ever made for Inuyasha, then by all means buy the game, but if your not in the mood to be lost all or half the time its probably best to just skip this game. Rent it if you can, that's all I'm sayn'."
2,Confusing,"Good grafics and story line. the game itself is abit confusing and if you get lost and go back to talk to the person that sent you on a mission or something they wont repeat where to go or what to do, it's confusing. over all pretty good"
2,"Missing Tracks 10 through 13, otherwise 5 stars","This is a very nice album, however the track listing is not as advertised. When I received the product it only had 9 track versus the 13 that were promised. Those additional track influenced my decision to purchase this album, but alas I am returning it today for a refund. 5 Stars for the album minus 3 stars for less than accurate consumer information."
4,timeless funk,"One of the best CD's of its era. Great beats, rhythms, and soulful ballads. I recommend you add it to your collection."
3,Good Reference...Not So Good Tutor,"Buy this book if you want a brief reference at times when you need some reminders. If you want to learn Director in a manner that will help you create something quickly, don't use this book. It is really just a collection of facts about different parts of the program. Get the Gross book and learn the program with an eye on creating a finished product."
4,"Thirty five years later, it's still a beautiful book","At the ripe old age of 46 I've come across this book, squirreled amongst the group of items I've kept since childhood. I last read it when I was 12, in 1972, when PL had written only one other book. I can understand why this is the only book I chose to keep from my childhood. Beautiful imagery and a powerful use of words that I found fascinating even then. The children seem a little 'old fashioned' now, but the story itself holds firm. My 8 year old son is loving it. I only hope the now fragile and yellow pages will last the distance."
3,Not bad,"Very nice product reviews, but most of the products are luxuries and expensive. There are more ads than anything else with very few articles. I was a little disappointed."
3,Volume 1 was better,"I finished Volume 1 last year, and I'm almost done with this one. However, this one is harder to follow because the Chinese meaning is on top with larger font instead of the Japanese meaning being on top like it was in Vol. 1. Also, there are just too many English translations for many of the words on here, which makes it even harder to memorize. Most of the words in Vol. 1 had one English translation. Well, anyway, I can't wait to be done with this one. Learning Japanese really takes time for some of us!"
2,Romaji inappropriate for this level,"This set of 566 cards follows on the first set of 440 cards. I find it highly inappropriate for cards targeted at someone who has studied at least 400 Kanji to use Romaji. Romaji distracts experienced students, misleads beginner students, and serves no real purpose once you have studied the basic forty or so set of Hiragana. I returned these cards after a week because of the Romaji."
2,Not durable enough for 4 yr old boys,"got this for Christmas, and my boys were excited to play with it while it lasted.The cars don't have any light/sound - the station does. The battery included went out pretty quick.The fire truck broke in a day. Sigh."
2,Build Quality Questionable,"Amazon shipped the SOS Playstation in record time. It was a gift for my grandson. He loved the fire station but the loudspeaker did not work and the siren was inaudable and flashing blue light was barely flashing. Thinking this product was defective we sent it back, only to receive a second product with almost the same problems. Will not order from this manufacturer again. I did see where this product has been discontinued. Thank goodness!"
3,"so, so","pros:* nice to see baby, prevents my husband and I from running up stairs at first ""peep"" our son makes (especially when he was first born and we were adjusting to being anxious first-time parents)* monitor works pretty well in the dark* nice to be able to turn monitor off and keep sound oncons:* monitor is heavy and bulky* sensitive to interference* does not come with wireless hand held unit* monitor has wire and always needs to be plugged in to an outlet* monitor is difficult to view in bright(er) light conditions* expensive"
2,Great idea but unclear picture,"I love being able to see my baby sleeping, and I've had this monitor for three years. When we first got it, it was one of the first ones out there, so we were really excited. Compared to other options now, though, this one certainly is not the clearest. The picture has always been very snowy although the receiver and camera are in close proximity to each other. We've used this in two different houses (and we do have a lot of electronics - cordless phones, cell phones, computer with wireless internet, etc.) and have had a very large amount of interference. I love having a video monitor, but I would not recommend this one for you to count on if you want a clear picture."
1,V Hold nightmare at close range,"We bought this at wal-mart and promptly returned it. Even though the camera and base were just across the hall from each other, the reception was horrendous. Playing with the V-Hold did not result in picture stabalization at all. We bought the Sight and Sounds Video monitor and it was markedly better. Picture was stable and very clear. There are some ""pops"" in the audio from time to time but it is not overly annoying."
2,very poor video monitor,"I had this for about 1 hour, trying to give it the benifit of the doubt, but then gave up on it and returned if to the store. It got good sound signal, but everything interfered with it (nearby phones, people walking between the base and the unit, ect) and then the video monitor had a constand roll, despite a never ending tweaking of the V hold dial. I would get it still for about 2 minutes, walk away for a second, come back and it was in full tilt spin. Just not workable nor worth the investment. There are a couple other brands out there, look at them first (like Summer). This is Saftey is actually saftey last."
4,common sense,"i read the book in one day and think it is amazing how many books you can read on the same issue and still always find something you haven't read before. Amazing.I liked Linda's book, it is very easy to read and Linda is very down to earth about the whole issue."
5,Finally the answer,"After a huge mistake of buying a currently hyped diet book which turned out to be WORTHLESS, somehow I came on this book and I found in it the answer for the eating problem I have wrestled with near all my life. I cannot even begin to tell you how good this book is and what it has done, and is doing for me. In it is all I need to know and do to be a normal eater. Finally!"
2,Uncomfortable,"Nose pads are serrated and bite into your nose. After a short while, they leave marks and become irritable. Otherwise, the glass quality and bifocal area are good."
