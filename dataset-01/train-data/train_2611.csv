1,"Censors suck, but that's not all...","I'm not to far into this game yet, but I just had to voice my opinion. The censors practically ruin the game, but that's not all. When compared to the first Manhunt, this is boring and the graphics seem like they're from 1985. I can only hope that maybe someday, after sales drop for this game, they will release the AO version. That way, all the moaners and complainers will have zipped it, and we all can play the game the way it was meant to."
1,This Game is Disturbing and Sadistic,This game is so disturbing and depressing that it makes the movie darkman look cheerful by comparison!This game is very violent and it makes Mark of Kri look like an T-rated game by comparison.Don't get me wrong I like violent video games I just can't stomach graphic or very realistic depictions of violence. This game is more disturbing than any horror movie I've seen lately(13 Ghosts).If I wanted to be depressed or disturbed I'll watch the news!This game is not for sensitive people or those who are squeamish!Only buy this game if you enjoy a blood and gory fest!Parents don't get game for your kids or teens this game is rated M for a reason!
2,DONT LISTEN TO THE HYPE!!!,"I bought this game when it first came out, and I was so excited. I just finished the game a few minutes ago, and I must say it was disappointing all throughout. I hoped that the game would get better as it progressed, but it seemed to stay at the same lackluster level. The graphics were awful, the enemies all seemed to behave in the same manner, the storyline was a bit bland, and there wasn't a lot of the blood and gore I kept hearing about. The ending was a joke (at least the one I earned). Anyway, I definitely DO NOT recommend this game if you're looking for a sick, twisted, gruesome game. This kiddie game does not make the mark. SAVE YOUR MONEY AND BUY ANOTHER GAME!!!"
1,Total Disapointment,"What a waste of time! I have been waiting for the release of this game with anticipation since I finished the first one. Man what a peice of crap. Rockstar should just close shop if this is what we can expect from them for now on. I mean whats the point. The whole reason people loved the first game, lets be honest, was the gore and violent killings. I expected not only the same, but better in the 2nd one. Rockstar, you guys are sellouts and the biggest cowards in the biz. If your not going to stand up for yourselves and your true fans and consumers, then sell your company to disney or something. Pathetic game, and a waste of my money. Thanks for nothing Rockstar."
1,Warning - this is NOT and AUDIO BOOK,"This is not an audio book of George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four, though perhaps I was the fool to think it was. Based on the title of the listing itself, I'd be surprised if the seller wasn't counting on idiots like me to purchase it from him.I was desperately seeking an affordable audio version of the book to use in my high school classroom as an adaptation for a student who had a medical problem and could not physically read the book. So, now perhaps you can understand my dismay at receiving a CD-RW copy of an old radio play...needless to say, I am out a few dollars, and my student is further behind than she was earlier.On the flip side, if you ARE looking for a copy of this Radio play from 1953, by all means purchase it and write a review of its contents."
5,My Advice ... Buy two copies! Why? ... A True Boaters Gift!,"If you own a pleasure boat ... power or sail ...this is required reading! The nautical detail in this inland sea work is wonderful, especially if you are just beginning your seamanship experiences on Lake Superior.Kathryn Grube, Batchawana Bay Cottage Owner"
3,It is ok but won't last long,It is ok but won't last more than few weeks. I have bought two of them in the past. confirm it.the quality is not that good.
1,Missing glove,I have never received this item nor have I any correspondence from the source of purchase after submitting numerous e-mails via Amazon.com detailing non - receipt.Terribly disappointed customer.
5,Tastes like Home!,Chef Theriot has managed to help a successful gastric bypass patient and Southern Louisiana Cajun to continue to have the tastes I grew up with. The dishes have authentic flavor without the simple carbs. I gave a copy to my surgeon who has family from my home town and he loves it too!
4,I hate to admit it but...,"When Patty sings, I melt. It just feels like she is singing about the joy and pain of all relationships. Love By The Hour is a great song. I wish Amazon had samples so you could all hear it. Naked Barbies are just roots rock and roll. I like the name - wish they could keep it forever."
3,Like,The price was right and they look good on my car. If you are looking for super bright lights to compliment your high beams though....these aint it.
4,Reader's Review,"In this peace of work, Sandra Cisneros draws on her affluent, Latino, heritage. By informing her readers of a young girl growing up in the Latino section of Chicago Cisneros creats unforgettable characters we want to lift off the page.The House on Mango Street tells the story of Esperanza Cordero, whose neighborhood is one of rough realities and harsh charm. Esperanza doesn't want to belong to her rundown neighborhood, not to the low expectations the world has for her.what would you expect of a person from such a neighborhood ?""She is not only a gifted writer, but an absolutely essential one"" Bebe Moore Campbell."
2,The House,"Now there are good books out there and there are bad ones, this book The House on Mango Street to me falls in between. The book did not really turn me on at all, it more or less bored me not to be harsh on it but the book did have some good points to it. If you are a reader that likes action, blood and guts well you will be very disappointed.The book is more laid back and you really have to reread thing twice. The book jumps around alot making it hard to follow. The House on Mango Street takes place in Chicago in a hispanic hood.The book talks about short excerpts of the authors life when she was a child, writing the book as if it was happening at the moment. It goes into pretty good detail for it being writen years after the events happen."
1,This was the worst book i ever read,This book was incredibly dull. The only reason I read it was because I had to for school. The longest chapters were about two pages long! I mean tell me that's not boring?? There was no point to the whole story and then all of a sudden it just ended. I don't recommend this book unless you have trouble falling asleep or you have a book report due in two days.
1,the real story is far more interesting than this movie,"please do yourself a favor and do not buy or even rent this film- i wish i had not wasted my time! i usually enjoy Mr. Ivory's films- ""room with a view"" is one of my all time favorites so with the recent discovery that Mr. Jefferson had indeed had an affair with his slave, Sally Hemming made me rent this video. That is only a tiny part of this way too long video, but that is not what is so bad, it is most insulting because the movie is told in retrospect by Ms. Hemmings desendents- so why on earth they would tell this story with their own relation is barely a bit player is beyond my comprehension. I'm certain that if the movie really had focused on that relationship it would have been interesting."
1,cure for insomnia,"I walked out on it (after I woke up, of course). May a pox visit upon Merchant-Ivory! I want my money back."
1,Many people walked out...I didn't have the energy,"This movie commits the one unforgivable cinematic sin: it's utterly boring. Some movies are so bad it's fun. Not this one. It just hums along, nothing much ever happening, until your brain becomes numb-ified. Truly, I even dug out my car keys and tried to scratch out my own eyes just to make it all stop...but I was yawning so much that I just kept poking myself in the tongue."
3,I'm not sure why this was made,"Why not cover the entire arc/breadth of TJ's visit to France? Funny, the whole time, the Cosway affair felt like a background element... until the film is over-- and you realize that it is indeed the WHOLE point of the movie (look at the cover of the DVD).It is actually executed rather well. It just felt like a part of a mini-series of which we only get to see one episode; thus seeming like a pointless endeavor for all involved.BTW- I thought casting Nolte was going to be a disaster, but he quickly became convincing; although he'd make a much better Andrew Jackson"
5,A masterpiece of history on film!,"Since Thomas Jefferson was a man of controversy, it is only fitting that a film about him would be almost as controversial as himself. James Ivory has crafted a magnificent glimpse into French aristocratic life on the edge of the Revolution. Jefferson is portrayed as the man of genius,as infatuated with the talk of liberty as the aristocratic clique he recreates with, while at the same time keeping slaves. He is torn between lovely Maria Cosway and one of his slave girls. Slavery is illegal in royal France, which adds a dilemma to Jefferson's well-ordered life. He is also tyrannical over his daughter's conscience, refusing to allow her to become a Catholic. What struck me is the France under King Louis XVI had more liberty than Jefferson's new republic. Superb performances, authentic sets and costumes, and beautiful, haunting score. Highly recommended!"
3,OK,This was a little boring but maybe more accurate it talks more about him and his time in Paris. I was more concentrated on Sally Hemmings.
3,An okay movie,Jefferson in Paris is an alright movie. It is to long and quite boring. The movie starts out with Sally Hemings's son Madison telling the story of his mother's relationship with Thomas Jefferson. Most of the movie focuses on Jefferson's relationship with Maria Cosway. Why would they have Sally's descendant tell of Jefferson's relationship with another woman besides his mother? Sally doesn't even enter the movie until the end and that is when the movie gets good. The actors did a great job considering the boring roles they had and Nick Nolte and Thandie Newton were superb. If you can sit through the beginning of this movie then I recommend this movie. If you can't save your money.
1,heavy,"I was disappointed in this film. It was slow, cumbersome, dreary, and no one seemed to enjoy making it. Whatever point was being made was not much worth the effort."
3,Package is deceiving,"The packaging was ok, the CD skipped quite a bit. You could still watch the movie. I just would have liked to know that the CD was in fact skipping before I bought it. The skips and subsequent voice quality was not worth the price I paid for this item. This CD is something I would have purchased at a yard sale for $1.00 at most."
5,Great product!,I am very pleased with this product. I walk each day and it is so helpful in keeping up with my progress. I can see what I have done for a complete week. Very easy to use.
3,Defective clip,"Very accurate but kept falling off. In fact it fell offwithout my knowledge and couldn't find it. Consequently, I didn't have the item to return for a refund. My wife had an Omron 150 model which also kept falling off. We have returned that. Too bad, I liked the accuracy and the 7 day memory."
2,Bad User Instructions... Bad Product Packaging.,"I cut myself removing the item from the package. The unit is shipped in the one-time heat-pressed clear plastic display package. You basically need a knife or heavy duty scissors to cut open the package, which leaves sharp plastic edges.The instructions are typical of Chinese-borne products.. Very little organization, and even fewer useful informationOnce I figured out (intuitively) how to turn on the pedometer, I was able to stumble through the setpoints to begin using the pedometer.Overall, this is a plain, no-frills pedometer. So far, it is working well (have been using it for 3 days.)"
4,Works well,"I really like this pedometer, since I mainly use it to track total steps, it's accurate and works well. It stays put on the waistband and doesn't flop around. Great purchase so far! Already recommended it to others. I purchased this to replace a pedometer work provided to us. I've had this about three weeks, and it seems pretty reliable. It has a different way of counting moderate activity so it's always less than I thought."
5,great,"love it. easy, accurate and well priced. sturdy. 7 day memory, calorie counter, clock too. recommended"
1,Does not have an ON/OFF button,"The pedometer just runs continuously and can not be switched ON/OFF in order to register the distance, calories, ... you have performed during certain activity.It may also not work properly under too many conditions.Absolutely useless if you want to control your performance on any kind of activity.It may only be useful if you are willing to stick it to yourself and keep control of your daily activity."
5,Good choice,Works as advertised. The automatic reset is a handy feature along with the seven-day history. Compared a .76 mile hike with a GPSr and they matched.
1,inaccurate,"The great ""extra"" features on this pedometer do not make up for the fact that it is wildly inaccurate. I probably should have returned it. At some point, I'll likely end up giving it away in hopes that someone will like it at least for keeping time. How could it be such a different quality of product from the Omron HJ-150?"
3,It's an alright pedometer,"I bought this when I first started getting in to fitness a year or so ago and wanted to keep track of my steps. I wanted a cheap one just to see if I would wear it and if I even liked having it on. It is very bulky and flips off your pants easily. It tracks very well, easy to use and cheap. So for a starter pedometer this is a good one. I have since upgraded to a fitbit but this was a great place to start."
1,"Nice pedometer, horrid clip","The clip on this thing is horrible. I had it on my belt, and kept knocking off when I took my hands out of my pocket. Once it came off as I was sitting down on the toilet, and guess where it went. So I clipped it to by belt loop, and it fell off whenever I shifted my shoulder bag around to get something out of it. So I clipped it on the other side. It still kept falling off. Yesterday it fell off somewhere and I didn't hear the clack when it hit the ground, so now it's gone.Otherwise I had no problem with it. You'll enjoy it while you have it, just don't expect to have it very long."
2,No Reset Button,"This product is pretty accurate and easy to use. HOWEVER, one of the major flaws is that it does not have a start/reset button. You can not choose when you want the pedometer to start recording your steps.The pedometer resets itself automatically at 12am, and starts recording your steps as soon as it is picked up.This was a major issue for me. If only I had known, I would not have purchased this product."
5,Best Pedometer I've Owned,This item is simple to setup and easy to use and with a pedometer that's exactly what I expect...simple and easy.
4,Covers the basics,"Has a few special features (calculates distance on height and weight, ""moderate"" steps for hard or fast-paced steps), but generally focuses on and does a great job at the basics. What I was looking for."
4,Works great but....,"Seems to be very accurate, I put in on my belt lost it 3-4 times but somehow the thing always managed to to it's way back to me. Finally religated it to my pocket, seemed to work ok there too, but it is supposed to work better clipped to the belt. Anyway, finally went through the wash and died. I probably will replace it."
4,Simple & Functional,"Like most products that I purchase through Amazon, the processing & shipment of this product was incredibly fast. The product itself is pretty good. People had problems having their device fall off. For me, that problem has not yet happened. The device is simple to use. It tracks up to 7 days. It has a clock. It's very basic and the steps seem pretty accurate. Overall, I am happy with my purchase."
4,Works well but humidity problem,"The product works very well as advertised. It's simple and straightforward to initialize and once that's done, it's just a matter of wearing it and looking at the results. The only problem I enountered was when I wear it during strenous exercising (i.e. racquetball, 5+ mile runs), and I sweat alot, the wetness of my shirts on the cover of the device soemtimes causes humidity to build inside the devices front glass and that effects the ability to see the results displayed (sometimes the actual displayed numbers are faded, however, viewing from angles will still allow you to see the results). I also discovered that the problem clears itself and the device displays perfectly again after a few days. Of course this only happens if you don't repeat exercise that caused the problem initially."
5,Get Physical!,"This is an excellent tool for becoming more active. I recommend it to many people to help realize how little they really move in a day. Then, it serves to help inspire self improvement in a few steps a day to a more acitve lifestyle. Ideally 10,000 steps. The clip holds well, rarely falling off you. There is no resetting like other pedometers since it has an internal clock and memory. Using the ""moderate steps"" is also a great way to get the cardio type activity for at least 30 minutes a day, which is a way to help your metabolism, blood pressure, weight loss, and hopefully preventing diabetes. I will jog in place folding laundry, waiting on kids, or anytime to try to get the 10,000 steps and/or 30 minutes a day. Then, my extra weight, comes off easily!"
4,happy with omron,"I really like this product. It's easy to set up and use, and it's not as complicated to read as some of the others out there. It provides exactly the right amount of information that I am interested in--time of day, calories burned, time spent doing moderate activity, distance, average speed, and it automatically resets itself at midnight so you don't have to. For the price, this pedometer is definitely worth it! I highly recommend this one. This pedometer is great! I like that it's relatively flat so it doesn't get in the way when I'm running or walking. I've had others that are bulky causing them to catch on things and easily pull off & break. I can wear it under fitted clothes and it doesn't bulge out. I have worn it just during a workout as well as all throughout the day to monitor my fitness activity. It keeps great time and monitors my calories and steps run/walked quite acurately."
1,Junk. Stops working from time to time,"Very disappointed with this pedometer. It does plenty of things, but does not count steps on random days, which is the only thing I need it for. Most days I have to reset it and then go through a number of entries for weight, etc., and make it work. Then after a few days it again stops working. Junk!"
1,Screws on back way too small to get off.,I aam really disgguted as the screws on back are so small that I can't get them off to put batteries in. I can't even find a screwdriver small enough to get the back off. Went to hardware store and they did not have a screw deiver small enough to get back off. thi iis absurd tohave toput this much time in this just to start it up.
2,spend a little more,I bought it and it is working one day and not tracking my steps the next. I would spend a little more money and get a better one
5,Great Product,Brought this thing on a trip to Disney with me to keep track of how much I was walking each day. To ensure it was accurate I took it jogging with me on a treadmill a couple times before. It was always within .1 mile of what I actually jogged. VERY accurate!
4,Enjoyed it for a few months,"I was delighted with this wonderful little guy until it fell off one day... the clip was still attached to my pants, but no pedometer was attached! What a bummer."
5,Works Great!!!,"This pedometer works great! It doesn't overcount (like if I shake my knee) like many others I tried. The moderate step counter is great for walkers and aerobic exercisers who want to track their progress and be sure their pace is good. The calorie counts seem low compared to the elliptical machine or charts for exercise, but that should just make you want to work harder to get the count higher."
1,"Nice, ... but",This is a nice pedometer. BUT... the belt clip does not work well it is always falling off the belt. Yesterday (after only 10 days of use) it hit the floor and cracked the LED face - End of pedometer.
2,Not very accurate.,"I'm not impressed with its accuracy. There is a road in my neighborhood that goes in a circle. It measures exactly 2 miles when driven in the innermost lane. When I walked it in the outer lane, with the pedometer, this is what I got: First walk: 1.84 miles, Second walk: 1.89 miles, third walk: 1.83 miles. It should have been longer than 2 miles since I was in the outer lane. I can't trust it, which is why I don't even use it anymore."
1,Don't trust it,This pedometer has got to be one of the least accurate that I have owned - and I have owned several.
2,still trying to figure it out....,not much instruction came with this. I'm still trying to figure out how to set it up. maybe i need to spend more time with it. have tried only 3 times for a few minutes.
5,Kept me motivated!,I received this pedometer for a nutrition class at college and have really been impressed especially when comparing it to another brand my husband got at work. I love how it moniters moderate steps and keeps track for up to a week. I lost mine 2 days ago and am replacing it!
4,start walking,easy to use. I put it on my waist band inside my belt loop not on the outside so I don't have to worry about losing it. Or hook it onto your pocket on the inside. I have had no problems with it.
1,not all that good,sometimes when u run / walk it would not count the steps. otherwise it was not that bad at all
4,Product Rating,"Its really good. I think its accurate.But I had to purchase a clip so that I could have extra protection for the pedometer. It has been useful, as the pedometer has fallen off my waist, and been held attached to me by the extension.Recommend it for anyone who walks regularly."
2,not what I hoped for,This may be a GREAT ped. but it wasn't what I had hoped.I was expecting to wear it all day and see my activity but instead you have to be speed walking for it to work.
2,Disappointed,"This is a nice unit - compact, measures steps & distance accurately (checked against another pedometer), BUT I can't reset it to zero so that it starts counting when I want it to start counting. I have never had a pedometer (and I have had a number) that you couldn't manually reset to zero; this one only resets at the end of the day."
2,Great until it needs battery. Then it can't be fixed.,"I own 3 of these pedometers. They work quite well, until you need a battery. Then basically you have a 50/50 chance that it won't work. With new battery installed, I got an error message, called the company and was told it was a problem that when not under warranty can't be fixed. Huh? Sounds like poor design coupled with dismal customer service. Too bad, I obviously was a fan, but to toss it when it still works is hugely wasteful and frustrating that they don't have a better answer."
3,Works great at first,"I used this for about 2 months before one of the screws holding the clip on fell off. A few days later it stopped counting steps. This is the second Omron pedometer I've owned that eventually stopped working. They work fabulously for awhile and have excellent features, but like most things today, they don't last."
4,"Easy to program, good and accurate","This Ormon pedometer is sooo much better than a Sportline pedometer. I like the ease of programming the settings, the quick look-up and access to the buttons, and that it resets after midnight.I like the way it keeps the data for a week, so I can compare my days. It is quite an incentive to keep walking!"
3,"Good for counting steps, but that's about it.","Does a pretty good job for counting steps...however it is not accurate if you are jogging or if you are running, and you can't simply reset your previous days steps, you have to reset the whole thing and re-enter your info. If you are only using it to count steps during the week then I would say its an ok product, but if you are using it for a day by day step counter then I would continue to look."
5,Pedometer,"perfect, easy to use and read. I bought it for my 80 year old mother and she loves it! I'm pleased with my purchase"
3,"Cheap, but not especially accurate","I carried this on a long backpacking trip to help keep track of how far I walked. It's generally accurate within about 5% on number of steps, but going up steep hills messes with it. The distance estimates are usually within about 20% over varied terrain. I can't tell what it uses to guess the step length, possibly the time between steps, but it's not very good at accounting for terrain or pack weight. There is no way to manually reset the step count, it just resets every day at midnight."
2,Too complicated,"If you want a simple pedometer , don't get this one. It barely counts steps, time setting is difficult and wouldn't stay attached to belt."
2,Love the pedometer...hate the clip!,"I loved this pedometer, it's simple and very accurate. However, after buying two of them, one fell off and was lost, the other fell off and was broken, I have switched to another omron that can be better attached. The one I purchased and have now, can track more ""stuff"" that I don't need but it has a better clip and it comes with a safety leash. The pedometer has come off, but because of the leash, it has not fallen to the ground. Hopefully I'll have this one for a while."
4,Great for starters!,This was my first purchase of a pedometer and it does actually what I need. I've had it for a month and calculates close to accurate.
5,"LOVE,LOVE,LOVE IT","This was recommended to me, and it will not disappoint. It is extremely accurate; there is no 'gait measurement' involved and it is very comfortable and lightweight;you don't even feel it. Because of this, it sits very flush and is not noticeable under clothes. I wear it every day and love how accurate it is."
5,Excellent!,"Love it Love it Love it! I don't know what people are talking about the clip falling off, it hasn't happened to me. Maybe I got a great one :) But this pedometer is a god sent. Works very well, stays on my pant all day at work, whiles I'm walking and whiles I'm jogging. First time owning a pedometer, and I love it!"
4,Maderos' Different Way indeed!,"I ordered this DVD on the strength of Rodolfo Maderos' performance when collaborating with Daniel Barenboim (piano) and Hektor Console (bass) on the ""Tangos Among Friends"" DVD and CD. Here, he devotes a surprising amount of time expressing his own personal views and statements, along with his superb mastery of his instrument, the bandoneon. Didn't realize he had his own (very good)""orquesta"" and trio. His philosophical statements are in Spanish (with English subtitles). Would like to add that there are no dance-spectaculars here, just a measured performance and some instruction for his students."
4,Reaches it's aim...,This is a great book to increase knowledge about the art hisory and culture in a very quick way...Some of the universities that me and my mate wanted to study asked for art history and culture. Before the exam we had a quick look to this and both of us passed. So thank you The Art Book...:)
3,Giants Visor,"The hat is nice but the elastic on back is a little loose. The product description stated ""one size fits all"" but not everyone has the same size head. My suggestion would be to make the elastic adjustable."
3,Could of been better..,"The only reason I am giving this game 3 stars is because Manhunt 2 was supposed to be twice as brutal than the M rated version we have now! Certain stealth executions were removed from the initial AO version at the mercy of the ESRB. The M rated version of MH2 still kicks a$$! I enjoyed the conspiracy laden story line and dark-gory themes. Even with the censorship it keeps up with sharp visuals. You can still see whats going on, whether its crushin a man's throat with a night stick or shooting their faces."
4,Great game,"Manhunt 2 is an awesome game you get to kill people in fun ways what more could you ask for, does not get too repetitive, constantly throwing new weapons at you and the story is pretty cool. Suggest it to anyone looking for a great psp game for a great price."
2,Hated it.,It was old and almost grainy.. the information was very basic. this is a 30 year old video .Not what you want to learn with. I suggest something else that is more up to date.
2,May as well read a book,"Most of this video is spent reviewing material more easily learned in a book. The video should have been dedicated to time on the water and illustrating how to perform the various maneuvers performed while sailing. instead the video mostly consists of a review of sailing terms, how to rig the boat, and how to unrig the boat. Little or no attention is paid to jibing and tacking."
5,The Most Bad A$$ Horror/Comedy EVER!,"Okay, so I might be a little biased, since I'm the director... but if you love the classic 80's slashers like ""Friday the 13th"" and ""Halloween"" you are going to love this! Mix in some HAWT, half naked cheerleaders, and you have a really good time. I grew up on 80's horror and wanted to make a contemporary version... Spirit Camp has got all the elements you want to see, and some absolutely hysterical scenes. It's funny, scary, and sexy. But don't take my word for it... Andrew Rose, of the Texas Bloodbath Film Festival said it was ""The Funniest Slasher of This Decade!"" And Parrish Randall of [...] called it the ""Best Horror Film Experience Since the Golden Age of the Genre!""I hope you have as much fun watching it as we did making it!"
3,Weak latches,"TSA and or Southwest damaged my case, one of the latches was missing when I got it from the carosel at LAX. Well I wrote to both Southwest and TSA for a claim, they both admitted no fault and I had to prove it was damaged during transport. The case still works, jsut have to find a way to secure the missing latch, or make one up. The missing latch really weakens the entire case. I'll get a metal one next time."
3,A nice little film,Dealing with a very current topic - social and ethical issues related to immigration this art film does a more than decent job in highlighting the hard conditions shared among both escimo's and caucasians in the border region between the US and Canada.The actors deliver strong performances mostly and authentical images of a social class working in the Walmarts and Gaps and often confined to trailer park like housing. In fact they are so authentic it in certain passages looks as if they were in fact recruited in these communities.Despite the harsh realities they are faced with it is quite uplifting film in my eyes and one to watch if you get a chance
5,Frozen River DVD,I have watched this movie repeatedly. I love it! The acting is so natural and you feel touched by each of the women and their real life situations in this powerful movie. I recommend it to everyone.
4,indie sleeper hit,"terrific, authentic view on this issue. Melissa Leo was scary good, definately deserved her Oscar nomination.Wish it had been another 15 min. longer, credits rolled at 88 min. On the Gloveman scale it gets a 8.5"
4,An unusual but effective thriller,"Working-class (Melissa Leo in an astonishing performance, one of the man virtues of the film) has been abandoned by her husband who run of with the money leaving her alone with two kids to raise.Given these circumstances. she accepts a perilous job: to transport people acroos the border under very risky conditions.This original plot will convey us to unexlored territories in which the duty and the ethical don't seem to fit; but even so, she will bet hard against all the odds.Tense and well supported script, filmed with extreme realism and brutal crudeness.A must see."
4,Engaging film...,"Original story and strong characters make for a moving piece set amidst the frozen tundra. Well-edited and acted, Frozen River keeps your interest as you follow the struggles of its central female character. For any parent who has tried to provide for their children despite difficult conditions, Frozen River will have a resounding familiarity. The lengths that Ray (Melissa Leo) will go to are believable given the circumstances of her situation. Add to that her forced criminal partnering with a young Native American girl, and you have one heck of a film!"
4,Very Good Film That Misses an Opportunity,"I was drawn to ""Frozen River"" because of the Oscar buzz it drew. I came away impressed but have one major reservation that I'll elaborate on later. This is a terrific film that keeps you intrigued throughout. Ray(Melissa Leo) and Lila(Misty Upham) are drawn together not so much through friendship but through dire straits. Desperation forces Ray amd Lila to smuggle illegal aliens from Canada through Mohawk country into the U.S. The film terrifically portrays severe impoverishment that would force these women to do the unthinkable. Leo and Upham are superb as two strong women who take extraordinary means to keep their respective families together. My reservation? Despite it's theme the film makes nary a comment on illegal immigration. This is a good film but if the makers had tackled this hot button issue more forcefully it could have made the film more infinitely compelling."
3,"New lyrics, but the same old song...","""Frozen River"" is a film full of good intention and empathy for its characters, but in its view of women it's no more advanced than ""Stella Dallas"": a woman is most noble when she sacrifices herself for her children. The naturalistic method of the filmmakers cannot disguise this hoary cliche. This does not, however, take away from the meticulous work of Melissa Leo and the rest of the cast and the compelling suspense of the story."
3,Frozen River....,"""Frozen River"" is a good film for the first two half's, and then ends on a sour note. The subject matter at times was a little heavy handed, especially towards the end. The wonderful Melissa Leo is truly the heart of this picture, and when it works it's do to her performance. I would recommend this film, but it just spirals out of control in the last half hour. I feel like the film's ending was very anti-climactic."
2,Two and a half -- what a downer,"And it really is hard to believe that a woman in such dire circumstances, the sole support of two kids, would start smuggling illegal aliens without missing a beat. Melissa Leo's performance is okay, not great, not a great part. She plays a beat down dollar-store cashier abandoned by her husband. Others have given the plot. I'll just say she's convincing, but she doesn't make it sing. And there is nothing redemptive here, just a sad story somebody made up as a star vehicle."
3,Pretty easy,"Although I have not completed the game, yet, what I have played has been pretty easy. There is not much challenge in it when you are able to drive through trees and cars (and I'm not talking about knocking them over. I mean drive THROUGH them). I like driving games, so I'm probably more likely to enjoy playing it then most others."
2,"Should be called ""Loading Buggy Driver""","1. The game is fun, especially how you get to create movie replays. Too bad there aren't ANY camera controls. How about a slow motion button or pause? Come on BAM! Entertainment!!2. The game loads FOREVER!3. EVERYTIME the director speaks the game freezes for 3 seconds. This is EXTREMELY annoying considering you'll be running out of time and it'll freeze because the director is trying to tell you he's almost out of film.4. The game is short.Conclusion: This game is not worth owning, renting maybe, but definitely not worth owning."
4,"Pleasure: A Woman's Guide to Getting the Sex You Want, Need, and Deserve","I think that for all of the women brought up to believe the ""sex"" topic to be taboo. Dr. Hutcherson provides us with a valuable tool for information."
4,Q's Veiws,"Fourth Grade Weirdo is about a boy who just wants to fit in. When Mr. Ditzwinkle doesn't have the money for the PTA everyone thinks that he stole it, but Dexter knows that he wouldn't do that. When Dexter is suspende from the Halloween party he goes any way with a couple of his friends, and trys to figue it out.The author, Marth Freeman, is a wonderful author. She has written Fourth Grade Weirdo, Fourth Grade Rats, The Year my Parents Ruined my Life, Stink Bomb Mom , The Spy wore Shades, The Trouble with Cats, The Trouble with Babies, and Always Rachel and quite a few others.There were a lot of funny parts in this story. Like when Dexter pulled a friend of his down because he was holding up a sign for his mom that said to vote for her. The reason for that was because his mom was running to and they were on TV. This was a really funny book.I think I would think that people in the ages of 8 through 10 would like this book."
1,This book [is bad],"On cover of this book You will read: '...mostly unpublished photos, three-view line drawings, and stunning state-of-art digital color images'.But in the book there are no good three-view line drawings (I know that such a drawings are aviable for Ta 183).'State of art 3D color images' are in fact very low quality, black and white, very bad renderings (You can find better in the net). Some of them has pixels 1x1mm! Picture on the cover is ink jet print!In my opinnion it is the worst airplane monography, that I have ever seen (I had to gave this book 1 star, but it should be 0).I can hardly belive, that someone would print it and sell it as commercial book!Don't buy it - it [is bad]"
5,A MUST HAVE FOR THE LANSKY SYSTEM,THE LANSKY STAND IS AS USEFULL AS THE LANSKY SHARPENER. THE LITTLE STAND CAN BE MOUNTED OR CLAMPED DOWN TO HOLD THE APPARATUS STEADY. I HAVE SEVERAL SHARPENERS BUT THE LANSKY IS BY FAR THE EASIEST AND MORE PRECISE THAN THE OTHERS. THE LANSKY WEBSITE IS VERY IMPRESSIVE ALSO FOR USE AND CARE OF THE LASNKY SYSTEM. EXCELLENT
3,Great product bad service,This product was what I expected. Very useful and easy to use. I like how simple and solid this stand is. I just don't understand how Amazon charged me for shipping when I bought a hold package with free shipping just becouse this stand was shipped to me late. Amazon you owe me $7.88
4,A little wiggle...,"This is a great product for all you Lansky users out there; it really saves some cramping on the hands. My only complaint is that the nub to dock the sharpener is a fair bit smaller than the hole itself, leaving a good deal of wiggle in the overall setup. I typically pop a piece of paper towel on top before mounting and that clears it right up."
3,Not what I was expecting,"When I received this product it wasn't exactly what was pictured. The product in the picture is much more finished than the one I got. They perform the same function though, which is holding your Lansky clamp.Other than the look of the product the only complaint is that the screw system used to hold it together likes to come loose, a little locktite should take care of it.I've mentioned it on other Lansky reviews that I have done but I really can't say it enough. Lansky's customer service is AWESOME! If there's a problem with any product you get from them, they will do everything they can to make it right. 5 stars for that!"
3,Lansky Sharpner Stand,Works as designed. Steadies the holder while sharpening the blade of any knife. Should really be a part of every kit and not an add-on. I now have two as I found my standard honing kit in my hunting box while cleaning out after the season ended. Definitely recommend this for anyone that uses a Lansky Honing/Sharpening system.
1,Not all it's hyped up to be,"Every single recipe I've tried out of this book has been dreadful. I'm a good cook and like to cook healthy meals, so it's not me. The recipes are not tasty, or even good. My kids certainly wouldn't eat them, and they aren't junk food kids. Don't waste your money on paying for the ingredients that go into these recipes, nor for the price of the book."
5,The Antidote for Ever-Increasing Paternalistic Orwellian Gov,... Smuggler's Run 2 is simply another (albeit somewhat anarchist) form of American expressionism wrought by American's need to free themselves from the bondage of overprotective and intrusive government--a cry for freedom and the American Spirit of adventure. It is the panacea for our Orwellian paternalistic era. Buy it and live free! At least virtually . . .
1,Boring and a waste of money.,"Not much more to say except that this game wasn't worth the ten dollars I spent on it when I purchased it used. Though there is somewhat of a story line, the game is boring. It's one of those that you wished you had borrowed first before you purchased it.I think the only thing that this game would be useful for is to use the disc as a coaster on an end table.Bottom line: F"
1,Don't people have morals today?,"Smuggler's Run 2: Smuggle drugs, people, and weapons, stay away from police, try to cross U.S. boarder, etc. I know it's just a video game, but is that the kind of stuff we want in the world we live in? There are a lot of young people out there being influenced by games like these, so I don't think this is a worthy purchase.All I can say is, let's all be careful on what we put in our minds. Games like this are not good at all, and there are enough bad things in our world already to begin with. Please think about that..."
5,ya,"I bought this game yesterday and I thought it was alot of fun. I played it all night. What u do is u have to pick up all these different things and take them to a certain base. But police are after u and there r other players trying to get your loot sometimes. U just ram right into them and u get ur loot back. And there is also a joyriding thing on it where u can just drive around all u want and explore the territory, similar to Midnight club except ur not in a city. bottom line, A."
2,Glad I rented this first,"I considered ordering this game because of some of the initial ""fun"" reviews that came out. I'm glad I rented it first! Although the concept of the game is good, the actual gameplay isn't all that great. It gets boring pretty quickly. I found myself really desiring some ""real"" weapons during multi-player mode. I then started to think that maybe I should start employing strategy... only to find out there isn't much to employ.Summary:Graphics are OK, gameplay is OK, Fun level is short-lived.Rent it once or twice for a change of pace, but spend your real money on something else."
3,Good but gets boring,I bought this game the day it came out. I went home and starting playing it and it was fun for the first week. But then as somebody mentioned in another review just got plain boring becuase thats all you do is deliever packages. I think they should've made this game better by making you do missions where you have to get out of your car and do strategic missions instead of speed but that isn't the way they made it. On the other hand the graphics are great and look like the gamecube was made to look like. The cars are pretty good but where in the h*ll will you find a truck with a faster speed than a race car this makes the game kind of not realistic. It is still a good game and worth buying. To sum it up good game at first but gets boring and a little bit unrealistic.
5,your a smuggler,Its like your in GTA3 with more racing missions and more laundering goods to other places for money from your little mob friends. Its like you try to smuggle sorts of things out like drugs and prostitutes out of the country but before you do that you must still face the U.S. border patrol and sometimes sneakiness is your best key to unlocking the secrets that this game has to hold.
2,Cyrillic is need and is missing for Russian or visiting Russia,"I like to content and would have used this book but...When I visited Russia, I had two maps of Moscow one in Cyrillic and one in Latin letters. Which do you think I used? I used the Cyrillic. Not because I could read it, but I could look at the street sign and find out where i was standing. I could not say it but the letters matched and i knew where I was. The latin letter map was impossible for reading the street sign.You can learn to speak Russian and not read the Cyrillic letters using audio lessons. You can not learn correctly speaking Russian using latin letters. The sounds do not always match the same letter. Until the book uses Cyrillic letters for Russian words, I can not recommend this work.The author did much hard work of very good quality. Without the Cyrillic it is poor quality book to use for learning Russian."
1,No Cyrilic -- A waste of time,"I'm sorry to say that ""Russian for Dummies"" was a waste of time...at least for me. Russian is a phonetic language and relatively easy to read...if you can sound out the words in the original cyrilic text. Unfortunately, pronounciation in this text is provided in an ""English equivalent"" which only approximates the Russian pronounciation and word sound. Russian uses 33 cyrilic letters...many of which have English alphabet equivalents...and is fairly easy to learn. For a serious student of Russian, ""Russian for Dummies"" is useless. If I had known this before purchasing the book, I would not have bought it. I would not recommend this book to anyone desiring to learn or add to their knowledge of Russian. I will add that Amazon has many other Russian texts to consider and are more useful."
3,íèàà èèèöà? (No Cyrillic?),"This book is quite handy...that is if you don't ever plan on reading anything in Russia. I don't understand why there isn't any cyrillic, except for the alphebet (big help!) at the beginning, you would think the being able to read Russian would help. Besides this slight error the book is quite good. A recomendation though would be to buy a cheap russian-english dictionary with this book."
3,"OK, depending on your expectations",I thought this book was going to be great because everything is spelled out phonetically in English. It was helpful until I learned the Cyrillic alphabet (which turned out to be much easier to learn that I thought it would be). Now I would rather learn words as they are written in Russian because I'd eventually like to become somewhat fluent. I think this would be a good book for someone travelling to a Russian-speaking country who just needs to get down some language basics.
2,Nothing in cyrillic,"I got really disapointed when I tried to learn Russian with this book. If you just want to learn how to speak Russian, then it might be OK, but if you're going to Russia and need to learn the language, you need to know how the words are written in Russian, otherwise you won't be able to read anything."
2,All right.....,"How good this book is for you depends on what you want to do with it. If you need basic vocabulary and lots of ready to use phrases for a vacation or speaking with a certain person, then sure--get it, because it has exactly that. But if you want to learn Russian, I don't think this book is worth it. The CD is great, true, but if you pair another book with Pimsleur, then it becomes just another CD. Without the use of the Cryllic alphabet, you really can't progress farther than this book in Russian, so it's really just a waste. The Idiot's Guide is a better purchase, even without the CD, because it gives you a firm foundation to begin studying Russian. Trust me, if you want to learn Russian, then Russian for Dummies is not the way. It's an OK book, but it's made to serve a certain purpose and that purpose is not the one I think most people who pick it up have in mind."
1,Useless,"I book uses no Cyrillic. For some this would seem to make the book easier, however if you are learning in order to travel you won't be able to read a menu or anything else. In order to learn a language you need the alphabet of that language. Using the latin letters makes things more difficult.The CD is also not useful because the conversations are not in the book so the reader can't follow along with the words on paper."
2,You'll never read Russian with this,"I should've read more about this before purchase. Fortunately, it was well discounted, because the authors only give you a brief passing introduction to the Cyrillic alphabet (without even naming the letters).If you went to Russia and got off the plane (or even look at a Russian website) with this as your introduction to the language, you'll be totally unprepared, as something as basic as ""Information"" will look utterly, well, Russian.I do see some value in the cultural tips they give, but trying to deal with Russian using a latin alphabet is foolish in my opinion. The alphabet isn't hard to learn (as the authors acknowledge), so why skip out on that? It doesn't make sense."
1,I wish i could give negative stars,I was very excited when i found out that the Dummies series was coming out with Russian for dummies. I pre-ordered it. (BIG MISTAKE) I=for the next several weeks i anticipated making greater progress in russian. When the book finally arrived. . .my excitement waned. There is one section in cyrillic. . . after that nothing. . just transliteration. A total waste of money for anyone who wants to actually understand what being written in russian.I have been very happy with other Dummies books. But i cannot begin to enumerate my diappointment in the Russian for Dummies book.
2,Not Good for Someone Who Really Wants to Learn,"The biggest fault in the book is that it does not use the Russian alphabet. I studied two years of Russian years ago and found the book pretty much unusable. I am used to reading Russian script and find the transliteration almost impossible to work with.If you travel to Russia, how are you going to read signs, menus, etc without being able to read the script? If you are interested in reading any Russian newspapers, or stories, this book will be of no use.I borrowed this book for my Kindle from my library. I am glad I did not pay for it.There are good Russian textbooks out there. The Internet has some good sites for learning Russian. This book is only good if you just want to fool around with Russian and are not serious."
3,Could have provided more.,"Most for dummies books are valuable as they provide a flat learning curve. Regretably, this book had a few potholes. It was incomplete as it fails to teach reading by not including the Russian script. Although, if someone merely wanted to understand speech, it does serve that purpose."
5,mantabulous,"A must have...how many times have you sat there and read the ingrediants of a lotion bottle wondering if the effects of SPF and aloe truely impact world events...then I discovered the ""Potty Time Book"" hanging on a friend's doorknob...I left only because my legs fell asleep...I've now purchased one for each bathroom...You should too..."
5,Contemporary CD w/ Hip Hop Flava but biblically sound lyrics,"I was totally overwhelmed by this talented and prolific artist. Never have I experienced a cd of this type to ""draw me"" the way this one did. I was drawn to praise, I was drawn to worship, I was drawn to a re-evaluation of me and finally, I was drawn to repentance...Is there any other agenda for a cd?Can't wait for the next one.PEACE"
3,HTML 4.0 Fundamentals,"The content of the book was easy to follow. I had no problem understanding the text or completing the exercises. My only problem with this book was that the some of the exercises in Units 5, 6, & 7 refer to student files not on the floppy disk that came with the book. I was able to manually recreate some files in order to complete the exercises. It was disappointing and frustrating, to say the least, not to have the corresponding files to go with the exercises in the manual. Perhaps I got an old floppy from a previous HTML course the published? Other than that, I enjoyed the tutorial."
5,I Recommend This Book !,""" I have NEVER read such an exceptional presentation of HTML as DDC's HTML Fundamentals. This Publication is superb! It's incredibly clear, concise, and logically sequenced with practical, jargon-free exercises."" - Sandi Scanneli, Training Manager"
5,HTML 4.0 Fundamentals Review - Feb 2010,"This high school/college style notebook is excellent in it's coverage of HTML programming. Very easy to follow, very complete, with lots of examples. You can learn the language just from the examples themselves.Only drawback, I wish they covered ""Tables"" in this book, however, I suspect Tables are covered in the next book. (which I haven't found yet)"
5,some of the tightest punk rock with meaningful lyrics,"Dogwood is one of the tightest bands i've heard. Their music is fast, but has a good variety of styles. Their lyrics are the most thoughtful lyrics ive ever read. they address the issues that most bands are afraid to touch. i definatly recommend this album to anyone and everyone that can appricaite some good punk rock"
2,old edition,"I put in the exact IBNS number and ended up with an old edition. To my dismay, I cannot use for my class because it contains different literature than what my teacher has assigned. The old copy I did receive however was in acceptable condition."
4,This Book Was Good,"Although this book was not my favorite in the series, I enjoyed because it showed a different side to Prue Halliwell. On New Year's Eve, Prue is kissed by a mystery man when the lights go out. Prue, like her sister Piper and Phoebe, had discovered they were witches, the Charmed Ones, earlier that year. After Prue is kissed she feels the need to kiss every man at the party... and does just that. She doesn't think that anythings wrong; she figures she's doing it just to find the man who kissed her so passionately. But when she goes to the New Years Party at the restaurant Quake, where Piper works, she continues her search, thinking he might have followed her here. But the men she kisses fall ill shortly after and while kissing all the men (even more after Quake, like a teenage skateboarder and a pimply mailman) she sees what must be death in their face. This is when she realizes something MUST be wrong..."
4,Darkness Indeed!,"Let me get that straight: All 10 so far published Charmed novels are great and worth reading. This is, however, one of my less favorites. The concept is exceptional, the suspense wears on for a long time into the book and the characters come to live as does the scene around them. Especially the idea of Prue going around kissing guys at random makes it fun. BUT I simply didn't buy the - now how do I say that without spilling too much? - explanation of that ""kiss of darkness"". So I liked the book but not the end!"
4,GOOD BOOK! =),hello.This is a good book.Its funny how prue is driven to evey man she sees.It's aslo exciting how it features Elena the tarot reader.It interesting how prue gets surronded by darkness.Who do you think the midnight phantom is?I'd better not ell you.There is sooo much cool stuff in this book but I don't think it's based on an episode.This review is coming from a serios charmed fan so if you are like me you should defenetly buy it!
3,Novelisations so easy to read,"I've recently been very addicted to Charmed. While (im)patiently waiting for season 8 to arrive, I've been adding some of the Charmed novelisations to my wishlist, and I managed to buy a couple as well.The problem with novelisations I find, as much as I enjoy reading them, you're always left very unsatisfied at the end. Plus, I'm reading them in no particular order which doesn't help. The three I've bought so far, all feature Prue, so that's alright.They're only based on the TV show, so there's nothing similar to any of the episodes so far. This one features Prue being kissed by a handsome stranger, and then having the urge to kiss every man she sees. Sounds like a great life, huh? Not so much, because there's evil behind it, and Phoebe & Paige have to figure out why Prue is kissing every man, and how to stop it before something deadly happens.Novelisations are fun simple and forgettable. Probably not a good idea to read them all at once."
3,kiss of darkness,"this isnt one of the best charmed books as all that happens is prue gets a kissing bug if your into the wiccan part of charmed i'd recommend a different book because this is more of a girly book, in the way of love. i think the books get better as the series go on so i'd recommend a different book."
4,Great for charmed fans!,"This book was pritty good, i didnt like it as much as i did 'The power of three' which is what initialy got me hooked on Charmed, after reading that i expected something very good, and this fell a little below my expectations. Also Pheoby was hardely in it. But it was good, i liked it and it had a good story line, it was also fun to try and work out who ""it"" was! I liked it and i definatly recomend it for all the charmed fans out there!"
4,who?,"This book is based on Prue. One day she gets her fortune told with tarrot cards. it turns out she gets a card of evil. Prue just thinks its nonsence. That is until it starts.... Prue is invited to a new year party and she sees a beautiful emerald necklace. Then at Midnight, she gets an evil kiss of darkness. Prue then changes into a woman who kisses every man she sees. She tries to find the man that kissed her. At the middle, she finds out its a warlock. The warlock will not go away.The question is ,: Who is the warlock?"
2,"Until now, I've never heard of addicted to kissing!","This wasn't the best Charmed book, and I've read them all so far, but it isn't (I'm ashamed to say) even close. Sorry- but I was just disapponited that it wasn't what I thought it would be. I just finished reading it for the second time last night, and if I hadn't read it a second time, I would have only given it one star. The book just....didn't do what I thought it would for me. However, maybe somehow this book could have been better...... How, I don't know, but I know it could have. Maybe by a little more excitment? And also, in all the other books, WHERE'S JAKE? They say he and Piper are an item, or as far as we know they are- they didn't break up in the book- so where is he? But, if people are reading this who are planning to write Charmed books, take note; ON T.V WE'RE UP TO, WHAT, THE THIRD OR FOURTH SEASON? I LOVE CHARMED, SO HURRY UP AND WRITE MORE CHARMED BOOKS!"
2,Honestly?,"I do love the TV show ""Charmed"" but this book is kind of boring. I've only read half of the book so far, but it's kind of one of those books where it's so boring that you skip whole paragraphs of the book because it's so unentertaining. The summary of the book is incorrect, and unuseful. Plus the attitude of the charcacters is different then the show, and Phoebe seems a little uptight, when she's the supposed to be the carefree youngest Charmed One. They use the same words to describe things repeatedly and some of the things Phoebe, Piper, and Prue say don't go along with there characters on the TV show or on the book...personally, I think the book is alot to be desired"
2,this was a good book,I was suprised with this book it is one of my favorit books. It starts when porue gets a kiss from some one when the lights go out but when they come back hes gone. she has this urge to kiss evry guy she sees. But then she starts to grow weak and begains to die. Will phoebe and piper be able to save there sister buy the book to find out
3,"Typical ""Charmed""","As I stated in the title, this short book is reminiscent of a typical episode of ""Charmed""... The story, while somewhat unique, is poorly written with stiff, stale characters and a predictable plot. There are several grammar and spelling mistakes, and the main villain is only introduced in the last 40 pages of the book. Meanwhile we have to read page after page of achingly boring drivel trying to pass off as mystery. And, as always in ""Charmed"", he's revealed by a casual flip through the sisters' Book of Shadows -- their bible of all things supernatural.All in all, a 60% seems like a fair grade. The upcoming ""Crimson Spell"" doesn't look much better either."
5,People like us,"With this amazing book Salvo Galano, finally, shows a simple truth: homeless are not space aliens fallen on our sidewalks. They are people, they love, they smile, they smoke, they fight, they fall. They have stories, they were clerks, soldiers, artists. They were us, until something went wrong. Usually not terribly wrong, they got fired, they got evicted, they lost all their money recovering from an accident not covered by the insurance. Salvo put them in front of the camera, like actors, or models, or important people revealing a world of beautiful human being who happened to be homeless."
3,Nice looking alternative to a filing cabinet,"This file basket looks much nicer than a filing cabinet, and that was the reason I purchased it. Sometimes small pieces of the wicker break off, but that's to be expected with the material.It cannot be securely locket, but if you don't need that feature and you can't easily hide a small filing cabinet, it's a good alternative as it's much more attractive."
3,Pretty but a little crumbly with age,This is a nice storage space for files that you want near by but don't have to open the lid a lot because it dries out and gets crumbly leaving wicker fragments on the floor.
1,Thumbs Down,"This book is all over the place with little documentation for asserted theories. I would not waste my time or money on this book. Let's just put it this way, 25 cents in my yard sale is going to be overpricing it."
1,This book and a box of twinkies have a lot in common: fluff,"I just listened to this guy do several hours on Coast to Coast AM hosted by George Noory. He was being interviewed about this book, and the man made a fool of himself. He was full of contradictions, talked in circles, and was unable to answer direct questions. Wait until this book is marked down on clearance to $5 if you need something to prop up the living room table otherwise, take a pass."
4,Really good,I think this book would work great for younger children (under 12). I am not sure it is so relevant for older children. We kind of modified the ideas for our older child.
3,You decide,"UFC Throwdown is a decent game. Not really much more to say than that. You either like it or hate it. Graphically, it's pretty basic and sometimes during truly intense match-ups, choppy. Realism is very good. Length of the average match, about 20 seconds. Again, you should rent this if anything else first because I'm sorry but no one deserves a ($) hole in their wallet. Have fun and Happy Gaming!"
2,Better then UFC 1 but still lacks,This games cool. My friends cousin is in the game. (Pete William) The graphics are pretty good. The modes are better then the first one. But my compaint is the same as the first one. Matches end way to quickly. I want more of a stragetic sim game engine involved. Why don't ground battles last 10 minutes or longer? It still feels like a button masher game. The moves are hard to pull off. The create a character mode is way too shallow. The games cool for a while but lacks replay value unless your fighting another live person..
3,Okay game,"It is a realistic fighting game. it came out long time ago, and the graphics are not good. The game play is fun but it goes too fast. no progressive scan support, unlike wikipedia says."
3,"Basic, but entertaining.","This game comes off as the first step in what could be a promising future for mixed martial arts video games. The controls are very basic, even overly simple. Your fighters actions are limited, the stand-up fighting is good, but the submition fighting and ground-and-pound are terribly simplistic. It takes a short time to get the hang of the controls, but the game can be mastered in about half an hour, and after that it is incredibly repetitive. No matter how good you are at the game, you inevitably lose one out of every ten or so fights by getting caught in a random submition. Good groundwork for future games of the same type, but for now (overall) not captivating, but entertaining for mixed martial arts fans who have some time to kill (and don't want to kill it in the gym). I couldn't see playing this game for more than half an hour at a time, once a week, and only that often thanks to the inclusion of Bas Rutten. War Bas. War."
3,"Hardcore,real fighting!","Now this is what I call real fighting!This is the best Ultiment Fighting Championchip game on the market.It is way better than the first UFC and Tapout,because the fighting system is way easier to handle.It gets better as your keep beating charecters,plus it has all of the real UFC fighters which ad alot of realismn to an already realistic game.The fighting looks way hardcore,and you can actully feel the punchs and kicks!This game will never get boring for UFC fans,either.Im not a big fan of UFC,but I enjoyed this!~"
2,Good Vac - No battery life!!,"Really like the Vacuum...but the battery will not hold a charge. I've tried charging it up to 48 hrs, and can only get about 3-4 minutes out of it, not even enough to do the stairs. Other than that, it is a great vac, I'll be returning it to find one that can hold a charge."
4,Good product overall,"I've had this product for only a month so far. I use it 2-3 times a week. Does everything I need it to do. Good price, good product, would buy it again if it doesn't break down within the next couple years."
1,Poor performer,"I had a 14.4 v Europro Shark that finally died after many years of faithful serice. I ordered this one, mistakenly thinking it was the same. I threw it in the trash - too small opening, too short a wand, not enought power. Only order for doll house cleaning."
4,Pretty nice short,"I found out after I bought this shirt that Devon and Jones primarily makes work clothes. Well, this is a pretty nice casual-dress shirt in the $20 range. It's a Dockers-style shirt, but I feel the fabric is a little softer than Dockers, and all in all, it's a pretty good value for the money. Based on this purchase, I will check out other Devon and Jones clothes in the future."
1,No Happy,"Shirts are cut wrong for me. I always and still wear a large. These are tight under the arm, shoulders and chest.Would not buy again."
4,Among the best,"This is one of the best in the series introduces new characters,new moves,outfits,(I specially enjoy Paul's shoulder smash as a finisher of an air juggle ) the whole nine ,they lack a little in background department compare to virtua fighters by missing meningfull details as sand track or sand for that matter on the beach stage.And the brakeable items seem a bit to square a little smoothing would have gone a long way, none the lest is a great game with solid controllers worthy of the series hopefully in Tekken 5 namco's team will fix those problems."
3,Kinda good,played this game and the second i took the first kick with Hworang i knew tekken tag was better. Graphics are better but it ...is [no good] how you don't have the tag team option. The movies make much more sense then the ones in tekken tag. They even talk. But its pointless how some of the best characters are gone. If you ask me tekken tag is still better but its worth the money. Personally i like hworang the most. But if you can combo with eddy you've won. I mean its impossible to block. By the way to use eddy by beating the game with christie and pressing o on her. But thats completely pointless how eddy isn't there. The best thing about this game is the graphics and the movies i sort of recomend it but if you have the money buy Vice city or the two towers.
4,A fun game,"although the graphics have improved,(and it is still better then Vurtua fighter) it lacks the graetness of its origonal conterparts. but i would still buy it."
4,Should've Been Like Tekken Tag But Still Pretty Solid!,"Like many Tekken fans I was a bit disappointed that there were only a limited amount of characters you could pick on Tekken 4, that said, this game is pretty decent. The old characters look a whole lot better especially Paul Phoenix with his hair down looks more intimidating. King seems to have better moves but Law looks constipated and stiff in his fighting stance. The new characters one in particular, I forgot her name but she's HOT. Though I'd recommend Tekken Tag, this wasn't a terrible game, it just could've been a little better."
3,Nothing Special but not bad,"This is one of those slow, clunky fighting games...being me I prefer Street Fighter which has more characters, better moves, and faster pace...if you like the SF games this probably wouldn't be your first choice for the Holidays..stick to Capcom fighting games...they're just better"
5,TekKen 4 Rocks -Even to a MOM : ),"Granted Im a mom and not a huge video game fan but my weakness is a fabulous kicking game and Tekken 4 is just that! I played this to 10 levels at the arcade already and I'm so addicted LMAO I even got my husband to sucker me to upgrade our system from a PS to a PS2, just so I could get this game... thats how great it is! I love the characters (I have to say it Christy is my fav so far-the guys im sure will just love the outfitt she wears alone LOL) and this game has awesome backgrounds with water and stairs and all kinds of obticles to fight near. Anyway happy gaming to u all. :)"
3,"Buy only if you're a Tekken fan, Tekken game collector, or just want to play Tekken force","I don't really have this game. I only played this at an Internet Cafe. The opening movie was great, but the whole game was mediocre. The graphics suck. The stories are stupid. There are few characters.(20) The only reason I wanted to play this was because I wanted to play Tekken force. I tell you. Only buy this if you're desperate."
2,Tekken needs a makeover,This is just the same old tekken I have been playing since Tekken 3.It doesn't even have the variety of characters that tekken tag tournament has and the new closed enviroments and walls are just lame. The graphics are not that great and not the improvement you would expect from one tag tournament with the reduction of characters and all. Buy Virtua Fighter 4 instead.
4,Tekken 4,"I like this game but its not the best.Tekken tag is the best of this series,But in in Tekken 4 the ends is funny and there is a Tekkenforce mode,Also some special features,Tekken 4`s Graphicsis the best in this series but there is no tag,My rating:Gameplay:7/10Sound:5/10Graphics:8.5/10Final rating:7.5/10"
2,Fun but now if you have played Tekken 3,If you have Played Tekken 3 before then you deifnetly will be very dissappointed with Tekken 4 because The only major diffrence from Tekken 3 to Tekken 4 is the Graphics and 3 or 4 more characters. There is not game play improvement but I think the game play has even gone worst. Like it is very dufficult to jump and etc. Also The game Play in Tekken Force mode is also totally not improved you character cant freely move and he/she is locked on to one person.I guess the only thing that was nice was the intro and Grpahics. So If you have played Tekken 3 and got bored of it them you should definatly not buy Tekken 4 because it is almost the same thing.
4,Tekken 4 review,"Hello i own Tekken 4 and i find it very fun so let me put it in a scale from 1-10 10 being the best scoreGraphics-10(Awesome Graphics the character's in the cut-scenes look so realistic)Sound-10(Great music when your fighting and the punches and slam's sound so real)Replay Value-10(it's a fighting game it never get's boring it's really fun when you invite your friends to play)Fun Value-10(It will keep you entertained for a while)Final Score-10(New features in the game like tekken force(which is when you fight soldier after soldier)story mode,etc makes this game a keeper it doesn't have tekken tag but it doesn't matter because the other options make it a great game.For Parents it's rated T for teen(13+) but my 5 year old sister fight's me. No curses or blood just punching kicking and wrestling moves. So if you want a fun game get this one."
4,this is one of the best games compared to Mortal Combat,"well, i have seen the game, and its fascinating with lots of power stuff, action thrills and more exciting. the characters are more sophisticated than the other TEKKEn games ever! its a must to play this game! i plan to have this game soon!"
5,THIS GAME IS AWESOME!!!!!,TEKKEN 4 is the BEST fighting game in the world of PS2 fighting games.I use YOSHIMITSU in Tekken Force but my favorite character to use in Survival mode or Arcade/time attack mode is BRIAN FURY.He has some fast punches but slow kicks unless you use the jump kicks or running kicks.The new levels are awesome especially the arena and parking garage because you can corner your opponents.The parking garage level is awesome because you can send your opponent through a stone pillar.I also like the jungle level becuz you are also in the water.I also play this game down at the arcade because it is only a block down from my house.I still like playing it on PS2 better than at the arcade unless you are playing against someone.I would recommend this game to anyone who has a PS2 or likes fighting games.
2,Virtua Fighter still King,"Tekken 4 is a decent sequel in the series but it still doesn't live up to the amazing Virtua Figher legacy. Virtua Fighter 4 is faster, has more moves and combos and takes far more skill to become decent at. Tekken's fighting system is far to newbie. Especially the fact that you can still get you opponent in a lock, i.e. perform the same move over and over so that you opponent can't do anything to get out of it and must sit there and lose very cheaply, in VF this is not possible to do. I must say that I'm very dissapointed with Namco for releasing such a sub par fighter after Yu Suzuki and Sega gave us such a masterpiece with VF4"
5,THIS GAME ROCKS!!!,"Tekken 4 is the best game ever! It has the arcade version, the story battle where you can play the characters story and when you win it has an awesome 3D movie. Training mode teaches you how to preform the moves, Practice you have a traing dummy that stands their while you beat him up and you can watch a move be proformed, and tekken force you go through several levels beating up Mishima Force Guards.You can slam enimies into walls and statues to take damage. This game is teen for two reasons 1.Realistic Blood 2.Some Foul Language but besides that the game ROCKS!!! If you are a fan of the previous games or fighting style games you will love this!"
4,Good For Tekken,After having played this for a while I realized that there was not that much to it besides the main story of Kazuya Mishima's return. Still one of my all time favorite fighting games.
4,A new country of fighting,"THIS GAME IS AWESOME! IT HAS NEVER BEFORE ADDED FEATURES IN THE TEKKEN GAMES LIKE WALLS, BETTER GRAPHICS, AND WATER EFFECT. THIS GAME ALSO INCLUDES NEW MODES WICH ARE STORY MODE, TRAINING, AND THE NEW ""TEKKEN FORCE"". THIS GAME IS TAKING A GOOD IMPRESSION OF ""DOA"" AND ""VF4"". IN THE BEGINING TEKKEN WAS MADE ON THE PS ONE IT DIDN'T HAVE VERRY GOOD GRAPHICS AND KNOW WALLS IT WAS JUST A OPEN AREA. NOW IT ALL CHANGED. TEKKEN4 IS THE BEST GAME TO BE MADE ON THE PS2"
4,The King Of Iron Fist Tournament anew,"This is an awsome game. Many people say that it is not as good as the rest of them but the only thing that I can find wrong with it is that there should be a few more characters that they had in the previous tournaments. They still have some of your favorites though like Yoshimitsu, Kazuya, Heihachi (of course), Bryan, Nina, and of course, my personal favorite, Jin Kazama. The gameplay is incredible and the stories are perfect. The controls are a little hard to master unless your an old pro at it. There are many more features than The King of Iron Fist Tournament 3 like, Tekken force, in which you fight hundreds of forces sent from Combot, Kuma, Kazuya, and Heihachi Mishima. It is the best addition to the Tournament series. I reccomend this to anyone that loves fighting games (by the way the graphics are AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!)."
4,Good Game,"Very good game and fun to play, not as good as tekken tag tournement but its good because of the new characters and somewhat upgraded graphics."
4,The Greatest Tekken Ever comes To PS2!,"I personally think that Tekken 4 is the best Tekken yet! With great graphics and good gameplay, I think every gamer will find this game the best fighting game for the PS2! I think that Dead or Alive 2: Hardcore and Virtua Fighter 4 are way below Tekken 4! It has a wide selection of characters: Hwoarang, Christie Monteiro, Craig Marduk, Kazuya Mishima, King, Ling Xiayou, Steve Fox, Paul Pheonix, Marshall Law, and Yoshimitsu.Every gamer who knows what a good game is should buy this game!"
4,TIGHT!!!,All i have to say is this is the best fighting game i have ever played in my entire life. I have always liked tekken and this one just takes the cake. Every hardcore fighter should own this game.
4,Bustaz better make way...,"Tekken 4 is aight. I mean, it could use more useful characters. Craig is a big ol' house and, although people who use him disagree, is a waste of pixels. Other than the lack of new talent and the tag option the game is one of the freshest. Virtua Fighter 4, yeah, it looks good but that's tripe. Tekken 4 is the game to have...until Mortal Kombat 5 hits and puts Namco to shame. MK FOR LIFE...!"
1,THIS GAME STINKS!,"I hate this game! They don't have any of the good charactors from tekken 1, 2, and 3! I was really dissapointed. I can't beleive I actually put this on my wish list! Take my advice and DON'T buy this game. It is a waste of money. I mean, the controls are just a pain. Don't even get me started on the moves. Half the good moves take so many buttons that by the time you can hit all the buttons, your opponet has already slugged you. If you want my opinion, buy Tekken 3. I mean, the moves in Tekken 3 are not as tricky as these. Also the graphics in this one are nothing compared to the other 4(including Tekken Tag Tournoument"
1,Hmmmm Another Tekken ha!,"Alright let me poot it this way, the tekken series is getting old , really old, and PS2 is also. Come on its been out a year before all the other new generation systems of course it has better reviews. The PS2's only good for GTA Franchise so other than the GTA games PS2 games [are weak]. Tekken will be like all the other ones. You wana fighting game, use youre brain and get Gamecube, Super Smash Brothers Melee, 3 extra controlers, and youre friends.... Just trust me and get Gamecube. IT has so many party games coming out and also allot better games. Like SUper Monckey Ball, Star Fox, MArio Party 4, wario land, Metroid Prime, Zelda(no brainer its gona be good), and more. So just forget about PS2 and Tekken and get gamecube You'll be better of."
3,COOOOOOOOL!!!!![ect.],"I kinda stink at this game but its really cool!For example:The charecters have new outfits![unlike tekken tag when they just change the color of the outfits]3 Reasons to buy:#1 awesome graphics#2 great storyline#3 cool new peopleyou won't be dissapointed,so......................BUY,BUY,BUY."
4,A Sloan Bishop Review,"This is the fourth instalment of the awesome Tekken series. This game's story is this - Hiehachi anounces the 4th tournament 2 years after the 3rd. The prize, the entire Mishima Ziabotsu(I think that means the entire company Heihachi created). He uses this to lure out his son, Kazuya, and grandson, Jin, because he wants something with the devil gene, or something.Pros:*Finally, good graphics for a REAL tekken game.*Christy.*The return of my favs(see tekken 3).*Interactive backgrounds.*Fun game modes.Cons:*Hiehachi wears a thong like diaper.*There is too much devil gene stuff in it.This is the second Tekken game on the PS2, but the first one with a story to it. This is a great buy."
5,Awesome !!!! The best fighting game on ps2 !,"This is an excellent addition to tekken series !! It is a ""new"" tekken ( unlike tekken tag, which is just all the characters from 1,2 and 3 with a tag option and no story.) Tekken 4 has awesome new characters along with all the best of the classic characters. The graphics rule and the moves are so awesome. You will love this game. It is way ABOVE average ( like other reviews may say.) I think it is the best in the series. Tekken is the one fighting series that does not dissapoint their fans."
3,Nothing New...Virtua Fighter 4 wins this round,"Tekken 4 is a lackluster remix of the previous tekken titles, minus the ingenuity of Tekken Tag. The characters are NOT balanced very well at all in this fighter. The only things this has going for it are the VERY nice graphic, the destructible environments and the Tekken name. Tekken seriously needs a wakeup and add something new to the series the way Tony Hawk is. For this year, choose Virtua Fighter 4, which has got everything this has got (Except the mission style mini-game brawler, which doesn't even reward you anyway!) and more. VF4 is the most balanced fighter since Soul Calibur, the controls just ""feel"" right. If this game didn't even have the Tekken name to it, it wouldn't even get on the top 20 sellers list. Stick with this year's winner Virtua Fighter 4 and wait for next years Soul Calibur 2."
4,A TEKKEN 4 ARCADE PLAYER,"YES,I ADMIT THE CHARACTER LIST IS ON THE SHORT SIDE. THE THING THAT SEPERATES THIS FROM VIRTUA FIGHTER 4 AND DOA3 IS THAT SOME LEVELS ONLY HAVE A FEW WALLS. YOU'RE NOT TRAPPED IN A LITTLE BOX!THE CRATE BUILDING OR CRATE ON THE BEACH...GENIUS! SOME OF THE COSTUMES ARE WEIRD (PAUL,KUMA,HEIHACHI,KING?)THE ACTIVE SCENERY IS VERY WELL DONE.THERE'S ONE THING THEY CAN'T SCREW UP,THE STORYLINE.THE STORYLINE IS A PERFECT ADD-ON TO TEKKEN 3 AND A GREAT START FOR THE NEW CHARACTERS.GRAPHICS ARE GREAT.I NEVER LIKED ARMOR KING,SO LOSING HIM ISN'T A BIG DEAL.MAKING LEE CHAOLAN VIOLET GENIUS...GENIUS!!! WHATEVER HAPPENED TO UNKNOWN? SHE ONLY APPEARED IN TEKKEN TAG.I THINK SHE HAD THE SAME TATTOO AS JIN.MAJOR FLAW NOT PUTTING HERE IN TEKKEN 4.TEKKEN 4 DEFINATLY BEATS TEKKEN TAG.I LIKE TEKKEN 2 GAMEPLAY MORE THAN TEKKEN TAG.PREORDER THIS GAME NOW (I DID)"
2,No way to increase the power-bar in the options menu !,"This is my first Tekken game. I think that this part 4 has fantastic graphics, but I am unable to truly enjoy the game because the power-bars are so weak.I am able to kill an opponent with about 9 solid kicks. This makes each round seem waaaaaay too short. There is no way to increase the power-bar in the options menu, so that your opponent can take more damage.I also have Virtual Fighter Evolution. In VFE, you are able to increase the power-bars from 100% to 400%. This allows each round to be longer, and more importantly = more challenging !!The second fault is that not everything in the environment is breakable. There are a lot of glass windows in the environment, but they are NOT designed to be breakable. Only about 30% of the environmental objects are breakable. I wished that everything was breakable."
3,Yuck,I have loved the Tekken series for years. This is by far the worst there is. The controls are terrible along with the moves. Disapointing. I almost wish I never bought it.
4,Tekken 4 Review,"This is a solid fighting game. It has the classic Tekken fighting engine which is what sets it apart from many other fighters. It has a great soundtrack as all of the other Tekken games do. Very nice fighting arenas, though I wish there was more. Plenty of game modes to keep one busy for awhile. Nice unlockables. Great game. But not a total gem, which would be a 5."
3,Could Be Better,"The story mode for this game was very well done, the graphics are excellent. But other than the story mode, the game needs alot of work. When you beat the game on Tekken 3 it gave you Tekken Ball, and on Tekken Tag, it gave you Tekken Bowling, which were both very entertaining and gave you a break from fighting. This game didnt have any sort of bonus game like that, which wouldve been nice to have. The Tekken Force was honestly terrible. The levels were way too long, and it got boring way too fast. When you played it, even if you got to the end and lost, you had to start all over. Theres no checkpoints or anything, and its just frustrating. They could make levels a third that long, and then add a few more levels, then it would stay entertaining, but it just got too boring. Overall, especially since Tekken 3 was pretty much the best fighting game of its time, I was hoping for more innovation. Decent, could be better"
1,Not very good book,"I couldn't understand anything from this book..Its definitely not for dummies. I am an MCSE,CCNA,CCNP and half CCIP and I have done all certs using self-study cisco books..but this one is probably not for self-study.Now I am going to buy sybex one.Thanks"
2,WOW! IT'S 2K5 WITHOUT CRIB!,This game is basically 2k5 without the crib. Commentary is exactly the same! Only improvement is stadium! I would wait for madden 08 or rent it...so you won't be disappointed like I was!
3,I can see why some are 2K football fans but.....,This game is a bit outdated. I would like to see a newer version with updated EVERYTHING come out and see it if fares against the Madden franchise. All this game did was get my juices flowing for a better football game so I bought Madden XX collectors edition and I thought that was even better than this even though that has Madden 09 in it. I bought this Madden version due to the fact it has Head Coach 09 in it and that game is so much fun. I would really love to see a newer version of that game come out too. I like playing with the retired stars on this game and would like to encourage them to make an updated version. I would buy and try it.
4,best sim football game available,"No NFL license and the lack of franchise mode keeps this game from being the best sports video game of all time (my opinion of course)Although its fun to play with your created teams and custom unis online, most people want to play with their favorite nfl teams. But as far as football mechanics and player physics this game is radically distinctive and without equal =)"
4,APF2K8,"All Pro Football 2K8 is headed in the right direction. It is a fun game to play. I have played with my son and our games have been pretty close. There have been no blowouts. We both agreed that this game is way better than Madden 07. EA did a lousy job last year. All Pro will be a clasic game to play for years to come. Since the players are retired stars like Dan Marino, Joe Montana, Emmitt Smith, Barry Sanders, Jerry Rice etc., it is a must have for your videogame library. Hopefully 2K will get back their NFL license back next year so that they can put out the best football game with real NFL players."
1,Huge Dissapointment,"My friend in I played this gamelast night. Gameplay was incredibly dissapointing with both of us struggling to get Joe Montana and Randall Cunningham to throw and accurate pass over 20 yards. The superstars are not that great compared to generic players on the field (which their are a lot of) and the game play is choppy. Graphically it could stand improvement as the player's look ""placed"" on the field and not part of the environment. Finally, the different game play modes are incredibly limited. We made it through half of a game, turned it off and I am off to Gameforce to sell it back today. This game would've been a ripoff at the old 2K prices."
1,TERRIBLE,"This is the worst football game i've ever played! The graphics are sketchy and the gameplay is exactly the same as NFL 2k5. Bringing legends back in a a game is a dumb idea! I think the idea of having fake teams, fake stadiums and fake players would be a smart and fun idea. But if your gioing to have fake stadiums and teams make the players fake to BLITZ the league did it and it was fun! This game is very bad I think that 2k games should make every player fake it's way more creative! if the don't do that the might as well just get off the market and quit wasting their and our time!"
1,Wrong Product,"I was sent the Playstation version ... bad on vendor. I haven't sent it back yet, because the UPS store has limited hours and I've been working 50 hour weeks. Terrible when the wrong product is sent."
3,There's a reason this game is $9.00,"I was looking forward to this game, but after a week of playing APF 2K8, I sold it and I'm having more fun playing ESPN NFL 2K5 on my XBOX 360. I think the concept of APF was great but the execution was sub-par, especially for game designers that turn out some of the best titles in the industry. The controller response was sluggish, the graphics were NOT next-gen, and my overall impression was that it was rushed. If the developers want to compete with EA once their NFL contract runs out, then they would have been better off taking much more time to release the best possible game. APF started at $60.00 and now you can pick it up for less than $10.00 - nuff said."
4,Great football...,"I'm a 2k football fan, and this version didn't disappoint me. Since 2k Sports was shut out of the NFL game a few years back, and I've played a few of the EA offerings in the meantime, the controls take quite awhile to get used to again. The amount of pre-snap adjustments one can make is daunting, but you'll get used to it.The CPU plays a good game. I particularly like the motion and shifts the AI gives you on defense. The graphics...well, the animations are great! Putting in a more realistic looking field surface would have done wonders for this game.I'm having a blast with this game. There's a lot to be said for handing off to Walter Payton, throwing to Jerry Rice from Johnny Unitas, clobbering the QB with Reggie White, etc. I recommend this game!"
2,Old,This game is fun if you never had madden. But i have and this is a giant step back. Confusing controls and bad graphics makes it feel like madden 95 and this came out in 2007 i would not by even for the cheap price
4,"For the price, pretty good be careful though.","4 of us in my office quad bought one of these each to hold lucky bamboo. Overall I would say the product works great, and for the price it can't be beat. Shipping was fast. People really seem to like the vase and many have asked me where I got it. I took off one star because the glass vase doesn't always sit evenly in the metal stand. Since nobody is ever touching it, it's not a problem. But if you are a ""stickler"" for these things, be warned.Update: 01/05/2011Lots of positive comments from people in the building complementing the design. Several others have bought it now. One word of caution though, 2 out of the 6 that have been purchased ended up developing a very slow leak which can be fixed with a glue gun just be warned. Mine however has been great!"
2,Unsuccessful,"Always I can find something worse than typor in the book. Though the author want to introduce some nice topic on the subject, too many errors and confusion make it not enjoyable."
1,Lousy products,"My Shark vac is an older, 14.4 volt model, but it never lived up to its claims of superior vacuum, and the battery died after a relatively short period. This stuff is overpriced, and under-performing - I'll never buy another one of these products. My old B&D Dustbuster +, albeit a little on the week side vacuumly speaking, is still going after 10 years+ without battery replacements. Don't waste your money on these ""Shark"" products."
1,bad product and lousy customer service,"Battery died in a couple of months. When you call customer service they will put you up for an item repair even if you had refused it. They'll charge you for the battery replacement, which you have declined two months earlier!! It seems like they speak but do not hear what you say.Avoid this manufacturer at all costs."
1,poor battery-expensive to replace,"We have had the shark for 6-12 months when the battery died. The replacement was $25.00 to include shipping. The new one didn't work. When I called to check on the replacement battery I was told I should have had a professional install it. Great product when it works, poor customer service and parts are expensive."
1,disappointing,"I bought this to measure sound levels. During the day, the lowest db level recorded was 65 db. I happened to wake up at 2 one morning, so I tried the sound levels then. The lowest reading was 64.7 db. My neighborhood is rather quite at 2AM.My research tells me a typical library is 40 db, so my house at 2 AM should be in the 20 db range. When the refer cycled, the noise level, according to this meter, stayed at 64.7 db. Sixty-five decibels is the noise level of a fairly loud office, not a quite neighborhood at 2AM.I contaced the company about calibration. Their response was that the service was not available.That makes my purchase a waste. If the sound readings are so far off, how can I trust it to be accurate anywhere else?"
5,Tear Mender,"This product fixes tears and stops further fraying in towels, throw rugs, leather car seats. It doesn't wash out in the laundry. I highly recommend it."
2,Tear Mender,"I bought this product because I needed something that would set up very fast. I had a couple dozen tears in three camo hunting blinds. It worked very well. I have yet to determine how strong the mends will be and how long they will last. My only complaint so far is that the product is quite costly for the amount you get and that 2/3rds of my bottle was wasted because it set up in the bottle once my repair was finished. I closed the cap between each repair and worked very fast but once used, there is enough air in the bottle to cause it to set up. Don't think I would buy it again."
1,VERY MISLEADING,"Having read several of the books in the 33 1/3 series, this one is justawful. The intent of this series is to disect one album from one groupper book.This is a bad piece of faction, about some loser drug dealer.The book is 160 pages, less than two of those pages could list all the facts about the band.This is a piece of fiction that would not have been published or sold without the misleading title."
1,Not for Band fans,"There's not much about the Band here, but lots of stuff about the sordid life of a drug dealer. Richard is the Band member most featured, but I doubt any of the scenes with Richard are based on anyone's memory or personal experience. The author clearly read and adapted much from Levon's book, and Barney Hoskins'book about the Band. If you don't have these get them instead of this book. I wish a good writer, with more in mind than the drug scene, had written the Big Pink book in this series. I'd accept an imagined work on what might have gone on within the Band in Woodstock, but this person did not imagine anything except drug dealing. There is little about the music, and not even an imagined scene in a recording studio."
1,Another shooting & driving game. The graphic is bad.,You play as a cop in this game. You can rob a car just like in Grand theft auto. The worst problem of this game is the graphic.It does not have many details.The car you're driving look almost the same as others on the street. They are all black or dark brown!Id rather play Maxpayne 2 or Burnout 3
1,Max Payne clone -- stay away,"Well, having played and LOVED Max Payne, I was totally looking forward to this game, seeing that it was being compared with Max Payne in several ways, but having played it now I only want to play Max again to get the bad taste out of my mouth that Dead to Rights has left with me. This game is merely a clone, and not a good one. I wish I would have read some of the game reviews for buying it, because they would have warned me to stay away. For example, I have the latest issue of GameNow in front of me, and they give the game a C+, and warn how bad the controls are and how completely way too difficult the game is. Their headline quote says it all: ""Frustrating and immensely difficult."" I don't play games to pull my hair out, so I can in no way recommend this game, as much as I was looking forward to another game with the cool style and fun gameplay as Max."
2,Frustration galore,"Today is the 4th day I've had this game on rental from Blockbuster, and no doubt about it, it's way too frustrating to be fun. The graphics is good, the storyline stupid but tolerable, and lurking somewhere you can sense a fun factor, but the difficulty and insanely unpredictable controls make this game sadistically unpleasant to play. A total letdown.Another thing that pisses me off is, this is a time exclusive title for the Xbox. While it's nice to have an Xbox-only game even if just for a few months, this game is so poorly programmed that I'm thinking we Xbox fans are being used as guinea pigs. If the PS2 version plays better than this one, I'll never buy another Namco game again."
2,What a disappoinment,"This game had the potional to be a great game, but it flopped. This game isnt worth [the price], maybe a nice [lower] price .... Game is loaded with problems from gliches to problems with viewing angels. Game seems like it was made by Helen Keller, by the angels you have the view the game in the fights scenes with. But this game is like crack its not good but you keep wanting more of it."
1,HORRIBLE!,"This game is definetely NOT worth buying, and HARDLY worth renting. The controls STINK, and are unresponsive, the graphics are cheesy, the game is just plain stupid. There are endless, pointless missions and they're horribly REPITITIVE. The odds against you are insane, and this game is horribly irritating. GamePro compared this game to Max Payne... Judging from this, they're no Pros. Time to switch subscriptions... Max Payne is a great game, this is NOT."
2,"Nice idea, but seriously boring after a while","There are a lot of fun aspects to this game, including the slo-motion dive and the variety of fighting tactics, but there are many points when the bosses and sitiuations are RIDICULOUSLY difficulty. They aren't challenging...they're just complicated by the mediocre controls and the lame game operation. You could spend at least 1hr. trying to beat some of the bosses or passing certain 50-1 matchups. These time-wasters really take away from any of the mostly weak story behind the game. Don't waste your money."
2,Not up to Xbox graphic standards.,"I was lucky enough to rent this game... I started playing DTR after a few hours of playing ""Enclave"" (my other rental). ""Enclave"" puts DTR's graphics to shame. DTR's graphics remind me of a bad PS2 port. The controls for DTR are also very confusing. The fighting did not seem to warrant much skill besides press this button to aim, or kick, or press another to fire or punch. The only way I could consistently get the camera to look where I wanted was to use the ""auto aim"" function. I was kind of out of luck with the camera when there was nobody around to shoot. I went back to playing ""Enclave"" after about 90 minutes of playing DTR. I own over a dozen Xbox games and I have to say that I am glad I did not buy DTR."
4,Almost a great game!,"I have to say that this game frustrated the [heck] out of me, from the bad camera tracking, to lock-ups, difficulty and controls that really should have been overhauled to be more usable. After all that though I didn't give up on the game, because while it did frustrate me, I really liked playing it. You REALLY have to learn how to use the controls of this game. I would recommend mastering SLOW-MO and using human shields. These two methods are your best friends, they will get you out of alot of though jams. Definitely not a game for those who like things nicely wrapped up with great controls and such, not that there is anything wrong with that, but about 90% of games have some sort of problems, if you can overlook the drawbacks, this game really rocks."
2,Horrrible controls!!!!,"The story line is your basic renegade cop. The graphics are good. The controls however are horrible!!! You can't control your aim, you have to pull the left trigger to automatically lock onto a target, thus if there are multiple enemies around you have to click the left trigger then fire, click the left trigger then fire,... repeatedly. It would have been a lot better to have a crosshair and move it with the right thumbstick. To me this game is unplayable. Get Max Payne instead it is the same basic plot and a great game!!!"
4,Gameboy,"Let me put it this way. There are four bad guys in a room. You get to dive on the bad guy in the middle while shooting the one next to him in slow motion, and -using his own weapon- disarm the now-without-backup dude with a cool move and immediately turn him into a human shield to protect yourself while killing the third guy behind him. At the end, before getting rid of the now useless human shield guy with one shot in the head, you will let your dog Shadow kill the fourth guy.You might think that this should be an easy game then. No way! Try playing the same almost-impossible zone for three times just because you could not pick the freaking lock at the end. Your hands will sweat while trying to pick the lock the fourth time. This game is a masterpiece. It has a lot common with Max Payne, it is only simply way better."
1,Frustrating ....,"Many already said that, but I will say it again:This is the most frustrating game I have ever played in my entire life!NO story.NO logic.NO fun.You run, you kill, you run, you kill, etc.Besides, if you want to spend hours playing the same level over and over and over, feel free to buy this game.When you are about to finish a level with some healt left, enemy characters suddenly pop up behind your back (even when there is no access behind you) to kill you.I truly hate that game."
1,Worst game ever made,"This is quite possibly the most frustrating and most poorly constructed title for the xbox. I would rather play azurik over and over again then to so much as pick up a controller with this game in my xbox. First of all, the controls are horrible, I mean who has ever heard of a shooter where the 'A' button fires, when there are 2 triggers on the joystick. The cameras are awful, when i push left the camera goes right. Also, the game is impossible, and not fun at all, sure the first few levels or ok, but boring, but after that it is just way too hard. I have already cracked the game into 5 pieces, so that I could somewhat get my moneys worth out of the game just from the enjoyment of watching it be destroyed. Seriously, I would rather burn $50 then ever buy this game again. If you are even thinking of buying it, get a clue, DO NOT PURCHASE THIS GAME."
2,Don't waste your money...,"Rent it... This game is just not worth playing... The graphics are great and it looks stunning but once the initial coolness of some of the moves wears off, you are left just following the clues around like a dumb dog...No variety, no allowance for trying things a different way...Sold it after 1 week!"
2,Can someone say repetitive?,"This game starts out great; nice intro, fun beginning, somewhat easy controls, and tons of action. But after a while the game just starts to get old. The game gets frustrating later on and it made me ask myself ""Why am i playing this again? I dont really care what happens"" (the storyline is dull). I wouldnt go so far as to say that this game is horrible, but its pretty dull in my opinion."
1,Poor Max Payne Rip-Off.,"This Has to be the worst Max Payne Rip-off in History. Poor Graphics, Linear Story, & a Cheese-ball Character. Plus, The auto aim is annoying. There isn't anything awesome you're missing if you skip this game."
3,some levels OVER CHALLENGING,"Dead to Rights is a very good action game. But they over did it with the challenging. Some levels are just too hard too beat. Right now I'm stuck on the same level I've been stuck on for at least 2 months. It's a level when you're shooting bad guys in a parking lot, out of a helicoptor. As soon as you kill everyone another set of bad guys come out. When you kill them, then another set comes out. It seems like some of the these F***ing levels never end. They just don't want you to win. When I first started playing this game I thought it was better than Max Payne because of the dog and the martial arts. But Max Payne was'nt over challenging. It was really challenging but not over challenging like Dead To rights."
2,A game with familiar themes,"Da story to this nearly copies Max Payne. A cop framed for murder seeking revenge, bla bla. Lemme git 2 da point: This game [is bad]. It copies a great games Storyline, and he can carry 2 pistols like Max Payne. It's gameplay is like Syphon Filter, cept wit a discussingly huge controller. You can Flatten yourself on the wall like Metal Gear Solid. The only thing thats good is a lot uv weapons. Namco, This IZ no Max Payne 2, so stick with Tekken, and such n such. If anyone with a Xbox is lookin' 4 Max Payne 2, don't look at this, but if u never played Max Payne, try this before u play that. This game is also cummin' out 4 da PS2, But like I want it, cuz Max Payne iz alot better"
5,help?,im on the 7th chapter and i only have a couple disharms i didnt really know that u unlock disharms by doing a lot of disharms until the 5th chapter after u beat the game do u get all the disharms and if u dont can u go back to a chapter and still have the ones u arlready earned and from their earn more until uNlock all? plz write a reviw to tell me or im me on yahoo im or aol im my aol sn is victoria0skimmer and my yahoo sn is christian_henkel2002
1,don't waste your money,"i went out and bought this game the day it came out. i had been waiting for it for months (as i do for any FPS) and was extremely disappointed. the graphics are pretty good, but controls just .... it has an annoying targeting system, which means you can't just point-and-shoot; you have to keep clicking the damn right trigger until the enemy you want to shoot is targeted. this game is .... go out and get a REAL first person shooter like Max Payne, Halo, or Turok: Evolution- which should be released on the 30th or 31st of this month."
1,INFURIATING!!!!!!,"Hardest game I ever beat hands down!!! I still have nightmares about how much I HATE this game. The second I beat it I took the game out, slammed it into it's cover (of which I had thrown across the room several times along with the pile of controllers) and traded it in. Don't know why I stuck with it till the end. Just didn't want the game to beat me I guess. To this day have not been half as angry as when I played this god forsaken game. Hate hate hate HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAATE this game!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,oh wow!,"so i read the reviews on this game before i bought it, and most reviews didnt have much nice to say< now i see why! The damn camera! and the inverted camera that you can not adjust. Lets hope that your a sharp shooter because you are gonna die alot, and have to reatsart the whole level,this to is very aggrivating. I can stay on a game a good 6 hours if i like it, i put this one down in 1. YOU WILL NEED PATIENCE TO PLAY THIS"
2,Disappointing,"I totally hated the camera angles of this game, they were awful. There really is not much of a strategy to follow to beat Dead To Rights. Just a lot of button mashing and ducking. This seemed more like a typical FPS. The story was pretty stupid and while I applaud the efforts of adding stuff like arm wrestling, lock picking, being a stripper, etc. to spice the game, it just made the game not only brainless but cheesy. I was expecting better."
3,Beware,"This game is Max Payne, except you are a K9 cop. Here are the Pros and Cons -Pros: slow-motion shooting/divingvarious lethal disarms of enemyeasy to shoot with one-button aimCons: game based on a continuous story, not levels (must save portions of the game if you want to return to play)stupid contests within the game (basically who can push a button the fastest, i.e. arm-wrestle for cigarettes)hand-to-hand combat (especially in jail) is horrible and repetitiveSummary: This game has no replay value. Rent it for a week, beat the game, and return it..."
4,Dead to Rights.......Good but could be better,"I've been waiting for this game to come out ever since the first time I read about its release. Purchased it from Best Buy on 8/21 evening - one left on the shelf! Got home and played it for about an hour. First thing I noticed was the graphics aren't the greatest - Max Payne is much better in this field. Game play is excellent, only annoying thing is the ""auto-target"" feature, you can switch to manual mode. The jury is still out on this one, but I am sure I will enjoy it. FPS games is all I play and i am sure this will live up to all the hype."
1,Don't Bother with this garbage....,"I gave this game a chance... A big chance. Went and purchased it outright before renting. I do that most of the time with great success. My last two choices have been poor to say the least. I wasn't as disappointed with the camera angles, controls, or graphics as the other reviewers indicated. What got me was the content. I'm stuck at about the halfway pointof the game [I'm guessing]. But for the majority of the time I have played, it has been hand to hand fighting in prison. If I wanted to get a program where I just have to beat the stuffing out of people, I'd drop back to my UFC game disk. I mean come on... All the ads and promos you see for this game are the great weapons and such that are available. Don't get me wrong, they're there in the start of the game, but once you get locked up in prison, all you got is your ""dukes"".Too bad there isn't a 0 stars rating, that would be my take on this POS. I'll be putting mine up for auction soon..."
1,Do not waste your money on this game.,"1) Take a penny.2) Flip it.3) Note that there are 2 possible outcomes to flipping a penny.That is twice as many outcomes as are possible in Dead to Rights. Everything is scripted beyond reason.For example, when you fight certain bosses, you lose your weapons. What the heck? And you cannot carry extra ammo for your weapons, but you can carry something like 9 weapons. Gee, great logic there.You would be better off donating your money to a worthy cause, and then flipping a penny, rather then playing DtR. Far more interesting and playable."
3,not for youngsters you play as a striper at times,Games....... OK but it's not all that. Shotting system same as James Bond 007 Everything or Nothing just crapier.
5,"Gospel CD ""Having Good Old Fashion Church""","It played great, I'm still enjoying it. I recommend it to everyone who love gospel music.Don't hesiate go out and buy a couple and give them as gifts."
5,So Long Ago,Man!!! I got this item so long ago that I don't even remember where it is. I do remember one thing though...it's an awesome CD.
4,Down home religion,"I purchased this for my Grandmother, and she absolutely LOVED it! She loves older spirituals, and is notoriously hard to shop for, so for her to approve, this is one to get!"
1,ERROR PRONE and no source files,"Upfront, in defense of the authors, I will admit that buying the book in 2003 does put it at a disadvantage. That said... The book was obviously ""thrown together"" with more mistakes than I have ever run into.. especially in the source code. Example: The book references both ""the CD included"" and a web site to download the files - NEITHER OF WHICH EXIST. The source code listed in the book is full of errors. On the positive side, I've found it to be useful as an introduction to animated graphics; however, if you are a newbie to java, forget it!"
2,Not what I expected,"Learn from examples? this book needs to learn from the examplethat has been set by just about every other Programmingbook.1. Include a CD-ROM of all source listing, as well as making it available on a website.2. Make the website address somewhat memorable...3. Put the source code in seperate ready to go files. All of the source code for this book is combined into one text file. And most important,4. Test your source code, and give it's limitations to the user. The source code I am using Network File Transfer does not work. I fear I am going to have to spend many hours decifering the authors code.I haven't finished the book, maybe it has some redeeming qualities. I'm not sure but I think there are better books out there for the money"
3,"""OK"" for when it came out. Garbage by todays standards.","I bought this a many years ago when it first came out. It was not that great, but it was basically the best you could get at the time. By todays standards, watching a ""load"" screen would probably be more entertaining...."
4,Sweet',This needle is awesome! It fits right on my crosley. Lasts a long Time and it's not too expensive. Very sweet price!
4,Crosley phonograph needle,"We have used the needle for only a few hours, so cannot comment on its performance. However, it was easy to install and looks at least as sturdy as the one it replaced."
4,Crosley NP1 Replacement Record Needle,"The needle did not arrived within the estimate delivery date and it seemed to be a lost in mail. The needle was eventually received a few days later. I was rather disappointed for the poor service of the Canada Post for it took one month's time to deliver the needle to me by Air Mail. However, I appreciated very much for the prompt response from ""My Needle Store"" to my enquiries of my purchase."
4,Good,I ordered this for a friend to give her boyfriend for Christmas. It arrived on time and undamaged. I have not heard any complaints as far as quality.
2,It is cheap.,The needle pushed up into the red plastic the first day. i pulled it out enough to use but it is still quiet compared to brand new.
5,Excellent Customer Service,I ordered this replacement needle for my record player after it sat unused for years. Unfortunately the needle didn't arrive and when I contacted the seller they immediately sent a another one! Now I am happily enjoying vinyl again. :)
3,I guess it works.,"At first I didn't know what this was. It doesn't look like what is shown in the on-line display. It came in a small container, but it does say it is from Crosley."
2,It's a NEEDLE,"I'm assuming it will work well. It's the needle number the book calls for. I bought it for the 'future'. If it doesn't work, then I guess I throw it away."
2,Not much better than my worn out needle,"I am by no means an audiophile or a vinyl aficionado, but I can tell when something is crap, and this needle was crap right out of the package. As other people have pointed out, this needle can't really support itself. It drags the arm against the record which makes the needle sound like crap and probably messing up the record as well. Now by pulling off the needle and messing around with it for a bit, you can get it to work with without dragging on the record(you have to keep doing this every so often, but for something I just purchased I would expect it to work at the very least properly right out of the package. Also, I can tell that the sound quality of this needle even at it's very best is merely adequate.I wouldn't recommend purchasing."
1,A Joke,This item is a joke. Might as well buy a whole new record player. It looks/plays like it belongs in the garbage.
5,Cyber Snipa Game Pad,"The Nostromo is better ergonomically; however, the sofware would go buggy every now and then (reinstall, reprogram). The Cyber Snipa is always ready."
4,the meadowlands,"A really wonderful tour of a place nearly every New Yorker has passed over through or around, but never really looked at. A very nostalgic trip thru the reeds of a world where the very mention of Paris Hilton is unlikely, even though the tops of HER world can be glimpsed over the verdant hills that were once garbage dumps. For a brief moment we are able to see the old Secaucus and vicinity before it became a neighborhood of New York City."
5,Terrific!,No nickel analyses here. This was simply a great read-fascinating and evocative. A must for anyone who likes earlier McPhee.
4,Vivid and engaging tale of one man's obsession with a swamp.,"Highly readable and engaging, this book allows the reader to go with the pleasantly obsessed author on his many outings to the Meadowlands. We learn a lot, from the checkered past of its epicenter, the much-maligned city of Secaucus, to the true burial site of Penn Station, to the essential disappointment of the much-vaunted Pulaski Skyway. The book doesn't try to be comprehensive or terribly organized, but that's part of its quirky charm. This is a perfect book to take along on any kind of vacation or adventure. Humorous and good-spirited, the author maintains his informative yet comical composure throughout this delightful memoir/travelogue/adventure/nature book."
3,Entertaining but Over-Hyped,"Perhaps it was the aggressive marketing, but I found myself disappointed with the book. There is much of interest and entertainment to be found here, but a number of vignettes (including the search for the ruins of Penn Station) came off oddly anti-climactic (perhaps because so little of the station still remains to be found) and the technique of the book (intro of a Meadowlands feature/area and a quirky personality to go with it) grows repetitive, so that by the end of the book one starts to know what to expect.There are a number of gaps in coverage, including construction of the Meadowlands complex, and there is nary a word about the extensive network of rail lines criss-crossing the marshes.The book would benefit enormously from some maps and photographs.Nice read if somebody lends you the book, but The Meadowlands may not be worth the price of a new hardcover."
5,Fascinating insight into an initially unrelentlingly ugly place....,"Sullivan does a great job of revealing the beauty and promise of an area hugely blighted by urban and industrial development, offers an example of how we might look more closely at many things, and highlights how careless we can be in destroying our natural environment..."
4,owned this cd since it's release,"I bought this cd in a box set when it was released. It came with volumes one through five, and out of all of them, this one is the best. It is the only cd in the set that has survived twelve years, and I still listen to it regularly. It is old-school, and most people that will buy this cd will not be impressed with it, but personally, it is very nostalgic for me and a lot of the tracks are good even for today's standards. Remember, this cd preceedes Cakewalk and other computer programs that make up the tracks of present day."
3,"Good mix of techno music, but not the best mix.",While the cd has maybe 2 or 3 good tracks it would have been better for them to have had a theme for the cd album. With a theme they could have added more music that would match the 2 or 3 good tracks of music. On the whole though they did a pretty good job.
3,Very difficult to set up.,this productwas very difficult to put together the pieces did not match up well and the instructions were not very helpful but when I got it done it did look great in my gs400.
1,Hated it,I really didnt like this game. If you want a real soccer game get fifa world cup 2002. My friend has it and it rocks. I bought this thinking it would be like that but less realistic. Yes it is less realistic but the gameplay is horrible.
1,Not a Good Soccer Game,"I purchased this game two days ago. I just played for only 15 minutes and returned the next day. Yes, it is really bad. This game is not fun at all because it is not realistic. FIFA 2002 or 2002 FIFA World Cup is a much better game than Redcard. The gameplay and graphics are not very good compare to the FIFA games by EA. If you are a mateur gameplayer and love soccer, don't buy this game. If you buy it, there is a high probability that you will hated. Try FIFA first."
5,Tightest CD to come outta Vegas!,"Mayne this album is sooo tight I can only compare a few albums to it. I think it's their best album all together. The reason is because the beats were tight den a mug, plus the themes were universal. The first 5 songs are hardcore, then it gets into the pimpin side. That makes a good combo 4 me player. I like it much better than ""Filthy"" because of the beats. The lyrics are always tight and sick, but the songs on ""Filthy"" were all the same genre. ""Pray For Me"" was an excellent mix of dat sickness and pimpish. My favorite is da sickness wit Lynch and Multiply, then the last 4 pimp songs, except the bonus track. ""Survival of da Sickest"" is just a remix of this album, so get this first then Survival. Trust me dog, this album ranks right up there with ""Season of da Sickness"" and ""Xorcist."" A Las Vegas classic."
3,Graphic yet appealing.,"Pray for me, some will after listening to this tape hence the title. This tape has it all drive by's, drug's, sex etc. the only thing it is missing is a notice reading: ANYONE WITH A HEART CONDITION SHOULD TURN THE TAPE OFF. While some are used to vulgarity and more advanced in it are used to the occasional ripgut cannabalistic style from Brotha Lynch, but this tape basically take's the cake. If your into that style (as I am) this is the one for you. Doomsday has very talented rapper's accompanied by very hard hitting even somewhat eerie if you will beat's, that are garaunteed to keep your speaker's boomin, and your feet movin. Though most of the tape is hardhitting it prove's that rap is not done yet. Especially this hard core style. This is Aaron Wamsley and that was my review on Doomsday Production's Pray for Me."
4,1st half good 2nd half too mushy and boring,"Loved the first half of the album, the second half got too booring and mushy. Of course I am a demented horrorcore fan. In the albums defense the first half of the album is good enough to warant buying the cd. Deffinateley worth a listen at the very least to any horrorcore fan."
4,could be a little more sturdy,"but overall is a great system. unless you send the knife back to the company to get it sharpened or to a place that uses a laser, you will have a hard time getting it sharper than you will with this system."
5,"the ""C"" clamp is a must have.","If you use the Lansky sharpener, then you need this clamp. In my opinion, it not only makes it easier to use, but it allows me to keep both hands on the stone and guide rod. This, for me, seems to help make a more accurate edge."
5,LANSKY C CLAMP,WORKS GREAT. JUST LIKE THE DIRECTIONS SHOW. I HAVE USED THE LORAY SHARPENER FOR OVER 30 YEARS AND HAVE BEEN VERY SATISFIED. THE LORAY IS VERY SIMILAR TO THE LANSKY. NEVER HAD A HOLDER BEFORE BUT I HIGHLY RECOMMEND GETTING THIS ONE. REALLY HELPS TO HOLD THE TOOL IN PLACE WHILE YOU ARE USING IT. I JUST PURCHASED THE LANSKY AND GAVE MY OLD LORAY TO MY GRANDSON.
3,ok product but not really worth it,"I got the Lansky Deluxe 5-Hone Sharpening System this c-clamp screws to the table and gives you a point to attach your Lansky. It's a find product, but for me I found it was not worth the price. Just me - others may find it much more useful."
4,Lansky C Clamp,"I cannot say enough nice things about the C clamp. It made sharpening my knives a pleasure. I always struggled before and even came to dread the time when I my knives got dull and needed attention. On some occasions I even got cut during the process, but not anymore. If you use the Lansky system you owe it to yourself to get a holder. The C clamp works for me, but maybe you would prefer the mounted variety."
5,Indespensible when using the Lansky Sharpening System,This clamp is indespensible to me when using the sharpening system while sitting at a table or counter top. It can be clamped in the vertical or horizontal position and It holds the sharpening system much more steady than I can do with my hand which helps to creat a more superior edge.
3,Rather self-defeating,"This book, as the title suggests, tries to make the case for perceiving Poland, former Czechoslovakia and Hungary as a single cultural entity, as a region with certain common characteristics and historical experience. However, as the reader reads on, she/he cannot help the feeling that the book unintentionally proves the exact opposite. This is not to say that the author is a charlatan - for there can be no doubt about the his erudition. Rather, Wandycz seems to be under the influence of the current geopolitical situation in Eastern Europe when the four countries (P, H, CZ, S) actually do face similar problems and tasks - but such moments are rare in their histories and cannot be taken as a starting point of writing their joint history. Nonetheless, the book would serve as an excellent introduction into the general history of the countries in the region."
2,Mired in terminology and details,"The history of central Europe is a much neglected topic, so it was with high hopes that I purchased this book. I am very disappointed. While obviously knowing his topic, the author manages to make it a chore to read about this fascinating but complex area. Early use of terminology without adequate definition followed by numerous assertions without any supportive backing quickly leads the reader into a ""I just want to finish it attitude."" Perhaps this work is best suited as an academic study."
1,Mrs. Bradley Mysteries NOT,"I received the dvd promptly however it will not play on my dvd player. It keeps coming up ""Wrong Region"" whatever that is so I haven't been able to see it and am quite disappointed."
1,BOMB!,I can't rate it because I can't play it..Both dvds show 'REGION ERROR'The Mrs Bradley Mysteries: The Complete Collection [Region 2]
4,Good controler,It does a good job of controlling virtual instruments; it comes with USB plug support. It's pretty light and the keys feel good. It needs to be ran with good programs to be of any use. I guess I would enjoy this product a whole lot more if I had cubase to use the module. I suppose music isn't supposed to be cheap to make. (I do have programs that the keyboard can play off of)I'm holding back on computer software for this controller instead I think a synthesizer with good voices might work better.
3,Interesting in parts,"I enjoyed the part about her years in Argentina. It gave me a picture of life there about 40 years ago. Also it was interesting to get an idea of the dilemma good German people were put in during WWII. Her brothers fought with the Germans although they decided to turn against the Nazi cause despite the fact that they were in the military. Her sister who was a nurse wrote ""...our beloved homeland..."" Her father, a Lutheran minister, a loving and kind and wise person, seemed to decide his allegiance was to Germany. That seems so strange to me. Yet if I had been told to fight in Viet Nam I might have done so although I was against our involvement there from the beginning. (Clinton was smart to be a draft dodger!) At any rate, I enjoyed the part about her time in Argentina. The rest of the book is really mainly of interest to her relatives and progeny, in my opinion."
2,Poor for beginner but pics are nice,This book is very hard for a beginning gardner. The photos are nice but it does not make anything look practical or helpful.
4,Awesome,"These ""new"" blades by OLFA are amazing. If you like to use the No. 11 X-acto style blades, but you would like to have a retractable version, then this is the product for you. I am a graphics installer, specializing in vehicle wraps, and I could never use the regular OLFA blades because I could not get the intricate cuts that I needed. These new aggressive angle blades allow for X-acto precision trimming. These are a great buy."
5,A beautiful tribute to Fay by a very gentle photographer,"William Wegman's latest book is among his most beautiful. Every page illustrates what a magnificent breed of dog this is and, more importantly, just how loved this dog was by his human companion. There are some early pictures of Fay, some of Fay in pastoral settings, and some with her pups. In all of them, she remains uniquely...Fay. Some of the pictures are quite tender and poignant; and some will evoke laughter. Mr. Wegman makes us see ourselves through a different ""lens"" and also helps us to take ourselves less seriously. As a fortunate owner of a Weimaraner, I am very grateful to the artist William Wegman who magically manages to make us smile and at the same time allows us to see the inherent beauty and intelligence of these dogs. Sometimes they are even smarter than their owners! I will treasure this book as I do my own complex and beautiful dog. Thank you Mr. Wegman."
1,They should have burned the tapes,"As a young member of the scene that coalesced around the UT's during the time that this CD spans, I was very eager to hear it when I first purchased it; I was instantly disappointed (fortunately, I only paid the then-retail price). All, and I mean ALL, of the live (including ""live"" studio) performances are horrible. The UT's who I remember, where a lot better than this. Unfortunately their three or four cover songs are not on here; those were always done well.The only redeeming thing is the inclusion of their first two singles, the song ""The General"" being worth finding their second 45 for.Save your money, and find their second single and their first LP which has a live recording of ""Stepping Stone""(recorded in 1983), which is worth a listen."
5,What To Do When You Are Diagnosed With An Illness,"After the diagnosis is when the race begins. The starter pistol has gone off and you must run the good race if you wish to have the best chance of winning your race against the illness. No one can run the race for you. You will have to run the race yourself. Treating and hopefully resolving an illness is not a set course but is, in fact, a matter of making choices. This book is about finding resources.""After Any Diagnosis"" explains how to:1. Interpret confusing medical statistics2. Find valuable internet sites3. Find the most up-to-date books, articles and journals4. Weigh the reliability and accuracy of medical information5. Determine the value of second and third opinions6. Research doctors, caregivers, hospitals and support groupsMany doctors declare that the most important thing a patient can do to improve his or her health is to be well-informed."
3,"Overall, nice reading","A wholesome, interesting story. I think it could have used a lot of pruning and it definitely needed a proofreader, with all the errors in punctuation and grammar."
5,Feel the Bass roll down your back!,If you are a fan of old school bass rap then this is the cd for you. You will not find any current rap CDs with bass dropping as low as this album. There are explicit lyrics in the album but if you are like me you are not listening to it for the lyrics but for the bass that will pound your subwooofers.
5,Great!,Awesome old-school rap at it's best. I used to play this on cassette back in the day and I literally wore it out. Great find on CD!

1,Las Claves del Codigo Da Vinci: La estirpe secreta de Jesus,"Este es el peor libro que jamas haya leido en mi vida, no puedo comprender el odio de sus autores hacia Jesus, Nuestro Señor. Tampoco puedo entender la manera despreciativa en como se refieren a Su santa vida y a la Biblia. Que Dios los perdone"
5,"Clever, Colorful Collage",Claudine has done it again - bringing us a book filled with joy and colorful eyecandy as well as a section of techniques and tips for creating collage art that even the experienced artist can see through new eyes. I loved all the bright colors and the layout of the book makes it easy to read and follow.
2,don't try this at home,"While Claudine's collage is inspiring, we bought the book to learn the printing technique, and it didn't work as explained. After three hours of following Claudine's instructions to the letter and $$ of supplies, we generated MUD -- undistinguishable images, and none as displayed in the book. There are no troubleshooting guidelines nor tips for successful printing. If you plan to use the book as a guide for creating xerox tansfers to paper or cloth, you'll be disappointed."
2,Check your library first,"If I had looked through this book before buying it, I wouldn't have. Check your library first to see if you like this artist's style. A lot of people do and if you think sticking a dunce cap ( I supposed it's a party hat) on every head and cutting square kindergarten-looking clothes out for photocopied heads is clever, this might be right up your alley. It's the only style represented in the entire book, except for the back where other artists have contributed. I was not inspired because frankly I don't want to make anything that looks like this. That's the great thing about art, there is something for everybody. It's the one collage book I bought that I read once and left it on the shelf."
5,Claudine does it again.,"Another great book with well written text and techniques. As always, Claudine uses simple objects into wonderful works of art."
5,Claudine Hellmuth,I highly recomend this book for anyone interested in mixed media or collage illustration. Claudines books are the best I've found. Her books demontrate many processes and inspire the reader to create art that is origional and meaningful to them.Her books are truly unique and inspired.
3,first book was much better,"Claudine Hellmuth's first book was, in my opinion, far better. It had many more techniques that could be translated both into the whimsical as well as serious art. The title of this new book made me think it'd be even more wonderful techniques, but it was more about how to use your own things (i.e. common things found around the house) to make collages. So perhaps if I had read this book first and the first book second, I would have been happier. The one thing I will say for Claudine Hellmuth is that she EXCELS in both books at explaining EXACTLY what you need to know.She does not leave out the hards parts and even goes as far as to state brand names. I have found her books to be far more helpful in that regard than any other. Also, she delves into discussions about composition, as well as discovery while making mistakes, which were very impressive. I have not seen anyone else do that. I am glad I bought this book. I just wish I had read it before her first book."
2,Disappointing,"It seems that after reaching the pinnacle that Claudine did with her first book her second book seems like a step backwards, almost as if the books were released in opposite order. Collage Discovery: Beyond the Unexpected is very basic in the technique's that are offered and seems more a forum for promoting her style of art then anything. It would be a great book for the beginner in paint to paper techniques, but not one I recommend for the more seasoned altered artist."
2,Not my style,"This book had been on my wish list for some time. I usually look for 5 star ratings, and this one had it. And I did read the reviews. So, it was a disappointment to receive it only to find out I didn't like the examples and had little use for the techniques. I love to create beautiful things--these collage examples aren't my idea of beauty. Not even all that interesting. And I just can't figure out what you would want to do with these things once done! Ick.Only one technique demonstrated that was interesting: crackle glazing with regular glue. I havw always only used a crackle glaze solution. This shows it can be done with less expensive and common products. But did this technique save the book? No, but that's just my opinion."
3,If you like THIS line of her work . . .,. . . then Claudine gives you wonderful detailed instructions in this book on how to build some. I'm not so much a fan of this line so that might be why the book was underwhelming to me.With that said - Claudine is undeniably talented and a genius in marketing herself and her work.
5,Poppets stye of collages,I loved the book. It provided different techniques and ideas for this particular style. A lot of photographs were also provided which offered inspiration. Several art forms were explored.
5,how-to that you'll want to,"Plenty of CLEAR how-to on techniques you will want to try. These projects easily work for artists of different levels, even kids. I can make creative, clever art or cards, and my kids can join in. I really like the sense of humor throughout."
2,Fish don't like em,"I got these for my feather fin catfish, pictus catfish, corries and plecos but they dont like it. They eat shrimp pellets right up but not this."
2,An otherwise good game RUINED,I've never seen a worse short game/putting system in my life. An otherwise GREAT and entertaining golf game completely trashed by the worst chipping and putting you will encounter in any video golf game for the rest of your life. EVER. I would buy this game if they'd have spent more than a day building the putting model. Completely inconsistent and inaccurate. RUINS the game.
3,Good but flawed,"This game is a wacky golf sim with solid standard physics and design. But it also had many flaws. Like no imagination on the course. It is more like Street Hoops (read my review there and you'll understand my point) , it dosen't have enough golf. It (just like Street Hoops) tries to make it up by making a big deal about the extras (which are only average.)"
2,terrible controls,the graphics are great. the jokes are great. the characters are great. the gameplay is great. BUT WHAT DOES THAT MATTER IF YOU CANT HIT A STRAIGHT SHOT! unless u move the joy stick perfectly straight up in this game u hook or slice
3,Fun while it lasts,"The graphics on the game are quite nice, and the modeling is really above average. Gameplay is interestingly done. Putting is a pain, and not very intuitive, but overall, I really enjoyed the game. Is it an accurate golf simulation, not really. Is it fun arcade style golfing, absolutely. I was just getting in the groove and moving along nicelyUNTILIt started freezing on me. Until this time, I've never had a problem with any game playing in my XBOX, but this one has a vicious tendency to crash on the 6th or 7th hole. It has done this to me several times now. I hear from several sources that Hypnotix is blaming the XBox itself, apparently they claim its an issue with first generation machines.So I guess the moral of the story is, if you bought an xbox early on, don't bother with this game. If you just got one, you might want to give it a try, it can be a very diverting play WHEN IT DOESN'T CRASH!"
2,Fun when it works,"I bought this game yesterday and I enjoyed playing until 30 minutes into the game it froze on me. A little box popped up in the middle of the screen that read, ""Bad Game Disc. There's a problem with the disc you're using. It may be dirty or damaged."" After this happened two more times in the next twenty minutes of play I went back to the store and exchanged the game for a new copy. The problem continued to occur with the new disc. What I was able to play of the game was fun, but being unable to complete a round is extremely frustrating. My opinion is to wait until the problem is fixed to buy the game. For a publisher (Hypnotix) that has only released one Xbox game this is not the way to start."
1,Worsht... game... ever,"Only 3 course, no real practice sessions, only extremely annoying tutorials. Grating commentary........ Too difficult at times to be enjoyable. Do yourself a favor and go outside and play a regular game of Golf. This game is the worst I have played on the Xbox next to Azurik. Buyer beware."
2,Horrible,"This is a horrible game. It has rather amusing characters but that's about it. Controlling the game is terrible especially the putting, which is almost impossible. Being able to fight with your caddy is amusing as well, but this game is not worth owning."
5,Golf Lover Delight,This is a great game for golf lovers. The only down fall the game has is that you can not play a tournament with multiple players. The best part is beating the heck out of your caddie. (wish I could do this on the golf course)
3,Doesn't fit every sink.,"I bought it for my standard white porcelain sink, but the hook would reach across even half of the middle sink divider. I was disappointed but gave it to my mom who has a standard stainless sink and the hook fit perfectly over her sink divider. It looks good and she really likes it."
5,Great as a basket!,I was looking for a sturdy basket that would hang on a rail to hold highlighters for a calendar hanging in the hall at work. This was PERFECT! It hangs sturdy and does the job perfectly. Thinking outside the box:-)
2,Caution: Not a universal fit,"Length:: 0:16 MinsThis product was much small than I thought it would be, AND it doesn't fit the lip of my sink, so it keeps falling into the sink. It is useless. The ""hook"" section will not fit a sink that has an edge of more than about 1 inch. Mine is about 2 inches. It will fit about 2 sponges, total. For me it was a waste of money."
2,Doesn't stay on sink,"Make sure you have a nice crisp sink edge that is elevated at least a full cm from your countertop. This thing doesn't stay put on my sinks. if the rubber part gets just a little wet, it slides right down into the sink."
2,Umbria Lattice Caddy,"Fast shipping! Caddy doesn't ""stay"" on the edge of the sink. Just hooked up a suction cup yesterday to see if that make it stay. It IS strong and sturdy tho."
4,NICE LITTLE UNIT,We bought this to position it over the divider in our undermount sink but found that it would not stay put. So we are putting over the side using a couple of suction hooks to hold it in place. It keeps sponges and cleaning pads at easy reach.
2,Smaller that looks / Weak Wire Mesh / Does Not Fit Sink,"As some one else said picture and dimensions are deceptive, much smaller than would useful for more than one or two sponges The wire mesh at the bottom of the one sent is completely loose. It would easily dent or pull apart at the bottom. Does not fit on the center divider of my double bowl stainless steel sink. Very narrow dividers only."
2,A mold nightmare,This is literally impossible to get mold out of and the mold is abundant. It doesn't seem dishwasher safe due to the texture of the plastic on the edge. Got a lot of use out of it but ultimately had to throw it out for hygiene reasons.
2,not what I expected,I thought it would be larger than it is.....works for holding sink sponge but NOT for silverwear.....slides off the sink lip easily as well......I was hesitant to buy this...wish I wouldn't have ...but will use it since its here and paid for
2,Disappointing,"Should have ordered the simplehuman caddy that has a specific place for a glass brush. This caddy holds a sponge, but a glass brush is way too tall. Really didn't work like I expected."
5,Another well designed and constructed product from Umbra.,I am quickly becoming a fan of Umbra products. They are usually well designed and constructed. No exception here. I use this to hold my silverware after washing them. Works absolutely perfectly and no signs of ware or rust after months of use. Don't know how I ever got along without this simple little basket.
5,Shocking,"These were delivered quickly, considerably cheaper than quoted locally. Fairly easy installation. Checked new against old and the new were definitely more powerful and the old needed replaced. Good experience with product."
4,"Great game, but a MAJOR problem","I gotta tell you, I'm pretty much addicted to this game. Everything about the gameplay is very realistic and the graphics are intense. It takes a little getting used to, but its worth the time.But, there is one major problem. This is a quote from the booklet...""WARNING: You cannot save Franchise or Expansion mode games using current Memory Cards...Mid Season Franchise or Expansion requires 1 File and 153 Blocks to save. Current Memory Cards have a capacity of 59 blocks.""You CANNOT Franchise or create an Expansion team! I think that is a major negative for this game. If you buy this game, I would highly suggest getting the new Gamecube 16X Memory Card... it is an extra [item price], but it will be very worth it for this game, and, I'm sure, future games will have the same issue. That card has something like 1000+ blocks, so you won't ever need to buy a new card again.Hope this helps."
4,a unique perspective on a familiar topic,"I know of no Christian writer whose approach to Christian ideas is more likely to break old familiar patterns than his. William's striking insights far outweigh the defects in style--and his approach is not easily found elsewhere, making his work invaluable to those who hope to explore traditional material in fresh ways."
2,Clotted thoughts,"Charles Williams' writing has been described as being like 'clotted glory': something that has value to say but is muddled in the communication. His obscurity and lack of clarity are just a little too much for this book to be successful, and I recommend looking to other writers for enlightenment on this issue."
3,A GOOD BASIC OVERVIEW OF THE SERIES,"First of all, let me start off by saying any book that puts Lost In Space in a positive light is okay with me. But on the same note, I have to write an honest review. So here goes. This book is not a ""must have"" for the Lost in Space fan, but it's a ""nice to have"". It devotes a few pages of how Lost In Space came to be, but it's predominantly an episode guide with basic synopsis for each episode and a short commentary at the end of most synopsis. It has sections devoted to the cast members including mild biographies and other works. Also includes backstories provided by two key writers, Shimon Wincelberg and Carey Wilbur. Not that many photos, all in black & white, about 22 pages worth spread throughout a 170 page book. There are two other Lost In Space books that are much better. I'll write about them at another time."
2,Say good bye...literally it blew away.,"The cover is too light weight and not strong enough for every day use.Pros:* gently hugs the combi models* expands to fit the combi travel system nicely* huge ventilation for baby* not a lot of plastic usedCons:- No real way to hold on to stroller besides the minor elastic scrunch- two small velcro tabs at the bottom fail to hold on to model it's made for- literally blew away in mild weather, the snow hasn't begun to fall- air ventilations may have been too big since my son would get wet and cold with all weather types inside of the cover and that is with my additional safety pin attachments so it wouldn't blow away.- not warm overall- not for every day useWould suggest more stable ties or snaps at the bottom and top of the cover for future models."
5,sad to see it end :(,"ok folks, this was teh final book, and i have to say one of the strangest. i finished the book very quickly, but more out of intrest. the end of the book, was slightly dull. but being a fan of the series, i read it, and loved it. after reading all the books in such a short period of time, i actually forgot how grown up relkin was. he went from a poor boy to a great war hero. i, liek how rowley left the book, because it through out the book s rowley let you use your own imagination, abotu how their lives were going to turn out. the last book just gave a little encouragement towards how the rest of their lives would end up. but i am sad to see it end."
1,Did he even care anymore?,"It seems that Mr. Rowley was told by his publishers that he had to make another book for Bazil Broketail before they would let him move on, so out of disgust and exhaustion he wrote this garbage. It is obviuosly no longer a labor of love for the author as the two protaganists go on some astral journey to destroy the dominator and fight Mighty Morphin Power Ranger style.I am firnly comvinved that the author did not wish to continue this series afer Battledragon and the subsequent writings clearly show this. What a sad ending to what was a great fantasy romp."
4,Irish Setter boots,"They are the best boot for walking in, but the one drawback is that they are not waterproof. For me I really love them, they are also very lite weight."
5,Mattel Batman,"This is a great action figure. This Batman is the closest collectors will ever get to a Marvel Legends Batman. It has full articulation and the accesories are like no other batman figure. The accesories are actually from the San Diego comic con 2004 I believe. With handcuffs, boomerang, and the grapple. Fantastic figure."
5,Easy to install and solid,"The directions were clear. The piece is solidly made and well finished. Installation was a breeze (but it is easiest with two people, so the seal at the top of the window is well compressed). It has been working well, without leaks.What else is there to say?E. M. Van Court"
5,"Excellent step-by-step, how-to book","I am a novice do-it-yourselfer and I bought this book so I could finish my basement. It has both textual descriptions of each stage of the project, and also has step-by-step pictures on how to do the each stage of the project from how to install a vapor barrier to how to do the dry-wall and ceiling work.A MUST HAVE for the do-it-yourselfer looking for step-by-step instructions."
3,OK but not the Best,This book is OK but I mostly used the Black and Decker guide to basement renovation. It had more information.
4,Rocking the Blues One More Time,"The long-awaited debut of the 22-20's offers a basic primer on how to rock the blues one more time. This quartet slept through shoegazers and Britpop and the current Radiohead idolatry, and woke up just in time to have their asses kicked by The White Stripes. And good for them. Their sheer sonic leanness gives their sound the appearance of freshness within the hypermelodic strains of Keane and Coldplay, etc. And guitarist/writer/singer Martin Trimble plays the blues verities for all they're worth: bad women (""Such a Fool""), temptations (""Devil in Me""), infidelities (""Shoot Your Gun""), and more bad women (nearly everything else). Better than the last White Stripes (come on, admit that Elephant was just okay)."
2,review of healing techniques,"I was disappointed the author devoted many pages to pictures of techniques of Tai Chi and Qi Gong, giving instruction without thebreathing technique that goes with it...a disservice to the art."
3,not bad,The book is a pretty good read. It is not An Encounter With A Prophet or a Conversations with God but it is not bad.
4,Traveling With Power,"If you are looking for specific techniques to improve the range of perception, this book will not disappoint you. Besides giving the story of his time with Don Juan (of Carlos Castaneda fame) and detailing his experiences at the Monroe Institute, Ken gives step by step instructions on techniques to use daily. I found the story of his life interesting and his insights compelling."
2,Read This with a Grain of Salt if you Bother,"I hardly need to warn you though, as it is completely obvious throughout that this guy is waxing a little poetic about his relationship with ""Don Juan."" Still, it has a couple of interesting ideas and if you're totally desperate for Castaneda inspired reading you could give it a glance."
2,"OK, but I expected more","This book was ok, I guess. But I had greater expectations. Terrific premise: creativity tips from the most creative people on the planet. But most of it was obvious or pretty boring. And you get the impression that the Imagineers have been *told* they are the most creative people way too many times for their own good... hard to take the self-congratulation after a while.Would have been better if an outsider had written this book, or edited it down a bit more."
4,I search all over for this CD,"I finally found you! This is a wonderful CD. Keith Brooks and New Creation have a unique style of singing that is fading with the new age syntesized, celebrity oriented music. I would encourage you all to write the label and see what we can do to get it into production again!"
5,A Beautiful Calendar for Anyone Interested in Literature,"This is a beautiful desk accessory for anyone interested in reading or writing. It's a desk calendar, but it's not year-specific, so you may use it as a perpetual reference for birthdays, anniversaries, special events, etc.More valuable than just for its function, however, this book is marvelously attractive. From cover to cover, it's chock-full of beautiful drawings, photographs and sketches of, by and about famous writers, their novels, stories and characters, etc.Of course, most significantly, perhaps, is that each day is filled with the births and deaths of famous writers, important dates in literature, facinating historical facts, and humorous quotes, all of which are indexed in the back along with information on the sources for the images and quotes.Without a doubt, this is a beautifully compiled book--perfect as an attractive and functional gift for any writer or reader."
4,Best baseball out...,"Yes this baseball is currently the best one out this year. Yes this game is also really, really, good looking. However, there is so much missing and so much potential that I think the game is only worthy of 4 stars. Details and realism are everything in a baseball sim. The Home Run Derby is an absolute afterthought. It's sooo shallow they should have not even included it. There are realistic features that were in EA's Triple Play '97 that are not even included here. This is Visual Concepts first run at the X-Box so I think we will see a big jump from VC in next years game. At least I hope so."
2,I really think this is overrated.,"this series may approach greatness in a year, but for now this doesn't suffice. worthless hr derby, stange pasted player models, no warm up oitchers, weird stat tracking, freezes, easy batting with one big bat cursor, no cut-off man throw that is reliable, bad baserunning ai, no jump button, cpu won't take balls/walk, roster errors, incorrect batting stances, ok commentary and stadiums, and many more issues that make this average"
5,The best Baseball game out there!,It is the best baseball game out there. I am attached to it and going a day without it is like going a day without breakfast. I would highly recomend this to any xbox or baseball fan!
3,Kinda,"The downsides of this game are that: if you run past first base and the guy standing first can get you out bysticking his glove into mid-air while you are half way to 2nd base and still get you out, another one is you cant hit the cutoff even though he is workin' his [butt] off to get the ball."
4,Top Notch!,"I am a very critical gamer who has little patience. In my opinion this is the best baseball game available on any system. The gameplay, which I believe is most important, is great. The game moves quickly and the graphics are fantastic."
5,Kicks big,This game looks so sweet and its for the xbox which makes it even better because the xbox is ten times better than its competitors.
5,Best Baseball Game for X Box,"This game is the best baseball game for x box. The gameplay is great. It has franchise, homerun dearby, exibition, MLB play. An awsome feature is that you get to pick your manager, pitching coach, minor league director, etc. This brings baseball games to a new extreme. The graphics are excellent and beat Triple Play and ASB 2003. If you love baseball this is a must have."
4,Franchise,The franchise mode for this game is unbelievable as you can now watch your players develope throughout their entire careers. Cons of this franchise mode is that there are glitches such as during the middle of the your season your lineup may be discomobulated by the computer. The gameplay sucks as it always has. World series 2k1 is by far the best baseball game ever. So if you want pitches to come in unbelievably slow then this is the game for you.
5,Fit perfectly,"This fit perfectly. Not sure why others had problems, but mine slid right in, and matches my honda. Very happy with this purchase!"
5,very satisfied,have been using this phone for almost half a year now without any problem. very satisfied with its overall performance. the speakerphone was definitely perfect. highly recommended.
5,pretty good...,"i dont know why you guys keep on rating it bad. i just got this game today and the game is plain great. i can see why fans of the origonal dont like it because its a lot different than the origonal. instead of the old top down view, there is a cool theird person perspective. though the graphics are not the best on the GBA, they are respectable. also, even though the game is short (with only 8 missions) you must play it multiple times and complete all of the missions to get all of the cheats and trust me, there are a lot of cheats to unlock. this is a great game for any one who likes racing games with some shooting and a little stratagy."
2,Don't waste your time !,"In hopes of a great game I found only disappointment. An unentertaining game with unrealistic challenges and soso graphics I can not imagine even the most die hard Spy Hunter fans enjoying this game.In my opinion, you would receive more pleasure if you were to go to shockwave.com and download the older version."
3,"Good attempt, but not good enough","First off, if you have one of the other versions of Spyhunter (X-box, PS2, Gamecube) don't bother. It contains the exact same missions. The main problems I find with the game is 1) the Interceptor isn't agile enough to dodge most oncoming fire resulting in a lot more damage, and 2) the car moves almost as fast as the bullets it fire, thus making the bullets useless. On other fronts it's a very nice game. The graphics and music are very well done and the controls make sense. However due to the afor mentioned issues, the game ends up being much more difficult and not very enjoyable."
4,Good product for the price,"I received this order very promptly. The products are of good quality, and the brushes all worked very well. Im pleased with this purchase"
5,Paint set,This is a great buy for the price. Very fast shipment! Loved the item. Am planning on purchasing another set soon! AAA+++ seller
3,Rating for Royal & Langnickel Paint Set,"The tubes of paint are very small, but when I compared it with Walmart package of Starter Paints, price was better!"
3,Not Great,"The paint is not professional quality, but not bad. However, the brushes, in my opinion, were useless. For an inexperienced painter, this would do...Then again, I think the brushes need to be sturdier. Someone else may find it's fine for them."
4,"very easy,very fun",this game is a lot of fun. While you can beat it in less then 1 week you will probably play it a few times.
1,Wasted Money,I wasted money renting this game. Words can't describe how bad this game sucks. Games like this make the xbox look bad.
4,Jet-Ski Fun Without the Salt in your Eyes,"This game is the only Jet-Ski game available for the X-Box, but there are immediate similarities drawn between this game, and the Nintendo 64 classic WaveRace.The levels are creative and fun, but it's the water graphics that really make the game shine. Never before has a game captured water effects so flawlessly as Splashdown.The controls are at first a little odd, but after a few tuturial lessons they become easier. After an hour of playing you'll be a master at carving a wake through the water.The gameplay is fun, but some levels can get a little frustrating. It's a definite rental, but if you're a fan of water sports than you won't be dissapointed. This is by far the best Jet-ski racing game available."
2,I was expecting a little more...only 3 episodes,"If you like the show hoarders, this collection has some decent episodes. But I was definetely disappointed. It cost significantly more than some of the ""full season"" of hoarders collections and it only had 3 episodes. SO it is a case of less costing a lot more. If the episodes were the best 3 episodes of hoarders ever...I could live with that...but they were just average.If you MUST have every single episode of hoarders on DVD, then this one is fine, but otherwise there is nothing to make it worth the high cost and limited episodes."
4,Seiko Watch,I like the watch very much...I thought the date being in a non-traditional place would take some getting use to but now I realize how little I notice it or look at the date. I have had several comments on the watch and I like the dial color. I did not realize how much noise the watch makes when it self winds. It was louder than I expected. Overall a good purchase that I will enjoy for years to come. I have a Seiko that I bought in 1986 and it still runs well.
5,Watch,"Great item, fast shipping. Still trying to get it to fully charge to thirty seconds. Sleek and stylish. A lt lighter than previous seiko watches."
4,Great for learning how to knit,"I just checked this book out of the public library today and as soon as I looked through it, I got on the computer to buy it!!! I am just starting to learn how to knit and these projects are fun and simple enough for me to make. Plus, they will make great gifts for the holidays."
4,beautiful,"The pictures are beautiful, the patterns clearly written and illustrated. Great ideas many fairly easy. A wide variety of styles in a sweet little book."
2,Eh.,"I purchased this book here in October. It took a month to receive it. A few days before receiving it in the mail I had stopped at a local bookstore to see if they had a copy (I was desperate and needed patterns for this years stockings). I wasn't that impressed, I've definitely seen better. Sure, there are a couple patterns that are nice but I don't think it's worth the $. So I returned the book. I'm glad I had a chance to look at it before it finally arrived.I'm also surprised to see the promise of 2 day shipping. If you're intending on getting this for some last minute Christmas knits, don't count on it."
4,A Quick Read,"Well-written, this one can be gobbled up in a matter of hours. But is it a good view of multiplicity? Well, it's standard, i.e. trauma-based and ending in integration. The interesting thing here is how her therapist deals with her. He nearly falls in love with her and walks away from the therapy because he has become too emeshed. It certainly isn't the type of therapy I'd want, but is is a compelling story."
1,Stuff my 3 year old knows is WRONG!,"""BRONTOSAURUS""??!! That name has been known to be incorrect for 100 years. And those dinosaurs couldn't hide in water and a meteor strike is what led to extinction. I can't believe how full of wrong info this 2007 book is. I could understand if it were a ""storybook"" but it's supposed to be non-fiction."
4,Interesting book about an alarming problem,"This book discusses several places in America where we are depleting the groundwater at an unsustainable rate. The author gives the history of the areas and of groundwater pumping in general, then goes on to explain the science behind the pumping that makes it such a problem for long-term access to drinkable water.One of the things I really liked about this book is the author's discussion of bottled water, the sources for the water, and the effects on the areas that allow water extraction by the bottling companies. It was really enlightening. He also discusses desalination and its high costs.This author of this book does a good job describing both the political issues behind groundwater pumping and the long-term ecological damage we are causing because of it. If you are interested in water issues, it is a must-read."
2,contacting company,"The watch band was too small for my wife's wrist, when we tried to contact the company to order more links the website provided did not work, and so we haven't been able to order more links so she can't wear the watch"
3,Look out! This book is obsolete.,"Do not buy this book unless, for some reason, you are determined to use an obsolete version of iPhoto. The newest version of iPhoto is iPhoto 6 (SIX!!!) and it is VERY different from iPhoto 5. (Sorry David, I wish your book was for iPhoto 6. I would buy it then. I do have your Mac OS X Tiger Edition, and it is GREAT!)"
2,Not as good as it claims,"The pitch for this book is that there are lots of hidden features that you would not know about without reading this book. I am by no means a techie but there was only one thing in this book that I didn't already know, and I never read any instructions. The program is very intuitive on its own and you will learn everything you need to know just by simple observation."
3,Omar Sharif Bridge,"The text that comes with this CD can be found in any book. The game itself is disappointing somewhat because your ""partner"" forces the bid so high that you lose the game. ""It"" will bid beyond reason or common sense."
3,Omar Sharif on Bridge PC,Too much emphasis on snappy graphics. Dummy is difficult to see if you are visually impaired. Bridge Baron 16 is far better for the serious PC bridge player.
1,Do NOT Buy,Not a good bridge program at all. You can't see the graphics and the partner has no clue how to play bridge. Too bad
1,Disappointed,"I really cannot review the quality of the game as I was unable to open the game from the disk provided. I followed all the directions and Omar Sharif Bridge would not come up. When I wrote to the distributor asking for directions to return the product, they declared that it was not their product (despite the return address on the box) and did not give me directions about how to return it. They stopped answering my e-mails. I am totally upset with this company and will never buy anything from them again. I am still waiting for Amazon.com to come up with a solution (after several weeks)."
5,Great study tool!,"I've always loved this book. I had to use it back in high school when I was a sophomore, but it's helpful now when I'm in college as a freshman. Seriously, this book teaches you the basic of chemistry well and has the best exercise problems. It's easy to read, but most importantly, it's easy to understand."
4,very happy,"I am happy with my purchase, book in good condition and arrived on time. I get better books from amazon then we do buying from last year's student's copies."
1,Don't Use For Tobacco,"Useless waste of money if you're buying it to chop/grind/mill tobacco. It has all the power of a bumble bee missing a meal. I doubt it would do diddly to anything of any real substance, it just has no power whatsoever. The system FORCED me to give it ONE STAR... that's nuts. Where's NO STARS as an option? NO STARS is what I give it."
2,Can do the job---slowly,"The product works, but the motor is so weak it requires great care. Much simpler (and faster and with better results) to use a blade-type coffee grinder. Those are terrible for coffee, but grind up other stuff just great."
2,It works when it wants to work,"It works when it wants to work. Not all the time. It came without the batteries (it sayd it would come) so i had to buy them, and still not working, just sometimes"
5,Good starting point,"I found this book to be a good starting point for planning my interfaith wedding. It gave equal dignity to both Jewish and Christian faiths, unlike some other books which want to emphasize one to the detriment of another. My officiants found the book helpful too."
2,ceremonies are too tacky,"The ceremonies decribed in this book are just too tacky for most people. The involve having the officiant give a speech about how Judaism and Christianity complement each other, while the Jewish parner recites the Lord's Prayer and the Chrisitan partner recites the Shma. Ugh. These ceremonies emphasize the couples' differences more than the marriage. Instead, I would recommend ""celebrating interfaith marriages"" by Devon Lerner. Her sample ceremonies seem more like real weddings."
3,Interfaith marriage review,"The examples in this book were thought provoking to an extent although it did nto include a Jewish ceremony performed by a rabbi only.I would have liked to have seen more examples of traditions from different religions (definitions of things like chuppah, why we light a unity candle and when it started), how you can incorporate traditions in to the ceremony when you are writing it, etc..."
3,I expected more from the book,"I expected more details in the book with regard to dispension papers from the church, how to raise the kids and explain the 2 religions etc.."
4,emotional journey,"I read Ms. Burr's novel, Silicon Secrets, which I loved by the way and was anxious to read her next book, and I was thrilled with the result. As in Silicon Secrets, in Desires and Deceptions, Ms. Burr creates memorable characters that evoke emotion. I found myself shrieking out loud to something a character was doing or saying, or anticipating something that was around the bend -- in retrospect, it was a wild ride!"
3,A good author,"I read Catherine Burr's first novel Silicon Secrets which I enjoyed very much. She is a good author and I feel that Desires and Deceptions is a good story and I enjoyed reading this novel, although I feel that Catherine has it in her to take the story to a higher level. I did see something in this novel that was interesting, and that was that I felt she was telling the story as a screenwriter. I actually think this would make a good television movie. I will continue to read her novels because she has a good mind for story-telling and I think her best is yet to come."
4,Funnest digimon game made!!!!!!!!!1,"You start out as a kid you get to name then you get a choice of wich 3 digimon you want. The only problem about this game is that you can not capture any of the digimon that you see, but overall this game is really fun!"
4,To get more digimon,"First off, you can get more than the three digimon you have already gotten. Such as an Agumon, you need to get the ddna of Agumon from Metalgreymon by beating him. I think he is in the next sector after the first one. He should be at the beginning. before you do that, you must talk to the dri agent of agumon. he will only be at Tyrannomon's valley(turn to the left after the long ladder) if your combined digimon levels are 30 or above.well i hope this helped you"
5,"Finally, after so many years...","When i was poor and about 8 years old, this game was the best at the time! but i only saw it at my friends house once and its stuck in my mind like forever. Waiting forever like a credit card, i finally gotten it! Its still fun... just lack of music."
1,The game did not work at all,"Even though this game was listed as acceptable, it did not work at all. I took it to a game store to have it buffed thinking that maybe the scratches on it were the problem, but that did not help. After having paid $28.98 for this game, I was very disappointed. I will definitely not be purchasing any other used games from Amazon."
1,A Fall for Digimon World,"Whereas the first two games had great graphics and many levels of fun, this newest game has the appearance of GameBoy Advanced, poor manuverability of characters, and fewer game options. It is Neopets plus Pokemon with the addition of three new Digimon. Bottom line: this is a step backwards for the Digimon platform."
3,"It's ""Ok""","This game is ok, but I prefer Digimon World 1. Yes, this game has the newer season 3 Digimon, but the begining is long, and quite boring. There are other things that I don't really like about the game, but this game is a 'must-have' for all digimon gamers."
5,Digimon World 3 rocks!,I think the person who is reading this should buy this game.I mean in battle the digimon can DNA digivolve into higher forms.If was you I will buy it!
2,Not that great,"Hi I am the kid who wrote the review about FFT. When I rented FFT I also rented Digimon world 3. Idodnt think it was all that great. The good thing about it is that it has so many digimon. The graphics are very bad. Compared to Ace Combat 3 and Metal Gear Solid graphics this game lacks. I was so into it the fist time i played it ,but im convinced that there is no replay value.Iplayed digimon world 2 and i thought that game was much better. It's good for five days or so but to buy it for its price isn't worth you're money. My advice to you is rent it before you play it."
2,PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS GAME,"Hey dudes,I use to love digimon and now i don't.(i am now into yu-gi-oh and beyblade.) I've tried this game out at my friends house and it is so boring. even my cousin thinks so. u have to get through a whole entire area before u can heal your self and beleive me it takes a while. all u can really do is just battle digimon and talk to people it is no very fun so please do not waste your money on it."
2,Bordom Onward,It was quite fun at first. Hours I played the game I loved it it was so much fun. But after a while it started to get boring. One major diffrance between World1 and 3 is you befrended digimon and they were permanatly Digi-volved. This game every battle you have to dig-volve them. They never dig-volve to Ultamate or mega. You start of picking beetween 3 packs its not much of a choice.On world 1 it was prety much up to you. In world 3 it was also very hard to find your way around. Once you explore a certain distance there is about nowear to go or do. That is a summery of this game compared to the original Digmon world(Teen)
2,"Very, very disappointed","As careful as I have been the pans are already warping and the finish on one is ruined. The pots are no longer round so the lids do not fit properly - I cannot even use them to make rice as too much steam is released through the gap between the pot and the lid. I have followed the instructions faithfully but have yet been able to keep the pans from sticking. Frankly, they are not much better than the regular teflon after the coating has started coming off.The information posted said they were ok for ceramic stoves but I cannot help but wonder if this is the problem as other people seem to think the pans are great.I do like being able to use metal utensils with them but that's about the only good thing I can say."
1,Started off so promising....,"Purchased this set at Target roughly 2 years ago...paid about $250. Much like an earlier reviewer, I was seriously impressed with the initial quality. However, after 2 years of steady use with great care taken to hand wash, never use metal utensils, etc, the finish has flaked off the small skillet, 2 of the pots and is beginning to flake on the medium sized skillet. Cooking quality was great with even heating, etc....but unfortunately, the build quality over the long haul is poor. I could have purchased a cheaper set and had them last this long.... Grrrr....."
4,I love my cookware,"I was a little sceptical about buying non-stick, as I am a previous stainless steel user, but I really like the hard anodized non-stick surface. It's so much better than other non-stick cookware I've used/seen. It is durable and very easy to clean. I cook on an electric stove, and this set heats up so well and evenly, that I don't really miss a gas stove, and can use a lower temperature because of the way they transfer the heat. I also love that I need little to no butter or oil to cook with, and usually just use them for flavor now. I do wish that the lids for the saucepans fit the omlette/frying pans. I've only had the set for a little over a month, and have not used them in the oven, but so far I am very satisfied with the product."
1,Do NOT buy these pans,"I have been meaning to write a review ever since I purchased these pans over a year ago, but keep forgetting. However, while making Jumbalaya tonight, I burned myself, once again, while trying to move the stupid thing. This has reminded me that I need to finally write a review on this set. On top of this, the bottoms of the pans get stained very easily, and no matter how much scrubbing you do, it never comes off. As nice as they look first coming out of the box, be warned, these pans are a piece of crap!! Save your money and get something quality."
4,He stole it from me... every word.,"Yeah. It's a damn fine book. Poetry or prose? who cares? Its the story of a man through the story of a town, a little rhythm, a little newspaper clipping, definately Modernist and definately good. I'm awful glad that WCW never turned into an Imagiste or a TV wrestling show. Let me put it this way, if you like: Faulkner, early Joyce, or the less obscure of Uncle Ez's poems, I think you'd find this piece of literature worth your while. If you want an all-American history story, ...sorry, I don't even know what else to suggest.Be prepared for inconsistancy and the requirement that YOU pick up the pieces and put them together; and they're fairly easy to recognize, to boot.It's a good poem, and I wish I would of thought of it first, but I thought of it last, and that is that."
3,catcher,works pretty good to catch debris from bird. tends to accumulate feathers that take time to remove.
4,The best boxing game I've played yet.,"I received my reserved copy yesterday and I have only now put the pad down. The custom boxer facility in particular, is great fun. In two player mode you can pit Tyson against all manner of your monstrous creations. Hairstyles, beards, bodyhair, skin colour can all be adjusted. Height, scale of torso, arms, legs, gloves are also infinitely adjustable.I'm not a big fan of Mike Tyson but the quality of graphics, game play and shear depth of features sold this one to me. All in all it's simply a more complete game experience and feels more rewarding than any other boxing title I've played.I'd recommend this title to anyone who likes fighting games."
1,Mike Tyson's Super Prison Break-Out!,Why would somebody name a product after a cheater/ woman-beater/ goober like Mike Tyson?
1,This is supposed to be the dumbest boxing game ever made.,Need I say more? It's supposed to be HORRIBLE. Buy Knockout Kings instead.
5,Comfortable,"Excellent fit, thought it was going to be small when I saw it out of the package. I move easily in it."
3,A white elephant creamer for a white elephant party,"I bought this for a white elephant party, since, well it's a white elephant. The only thing to know is that it's only about 3in big. So, in practice it's quite a small elephant and I'm not quite sure how much creamer it would hold. I assume if you want to be fancy for your morning coffee and hold one serving of creamer, you're totally set. But, it's good to give as a gift!"
5,BizRate.com is the best shopping portal!,"This is the best tool anyone could want this Christmas! It gives you the best online store locations to shop at! I don't even have to leave my house this year to buy a single gift.The guide gives a great alphabetical listing of the good vendors listed on bizrate.com, along with their BizRating--so you know who you're buying from, and what type of reputation they have with other BizRate customers. Some entries even have comments straight from users' mouths. A great deal at a low price--something every avid online buyer should have."
2,Not up to live Power.,"Dr. Power, my seminary Hebrew instructor, must be experienced in the flesh to gain a true appreciation of the power of his story-telling. This book seems like warmed-over mash potatoes."
4,Amazing Fun!,"This product is an perfect gift idea for any age. It's lots of fun, very portable and easy to hook up. I bought this product about a year ago and still use it all the time. You will never get tired of it. The Nintendo Gamecube a great buy."
4,"It's not that good now, but it will be by 2003","Right now the PS2 is the console to get. It has many good games now. Gamecube doesn't have many games now. But just wait until this summer, fall, and winter, you'll be playing those great Nintendo games. Like Metroid, Mario, Mario Pardy 4, Legend of Zelda (don't let anyone tell you this game is for kids only), and many, many more. I would reccommend to buy it later in 2002 when the games are good. Buy it now if you're a huge Star Wars fan or don't own a PS2/Xbox."
5,Gamecube is the best!,"Gamecube is obviously better than all the other sytems...I mean who came out with some of the best games ever?!?!? Nintendo, of course. Its small size makes gamecube very popular. Plus the handle makes it easy for transportation. The wide variety of games is also good. If, u hear from other reviews that the games are to ""childish"" then their full of it. These games go from first person shooting games to games like super samsh bros. meele and luigius mansion. If your interested in buying a video game system thats [inexpensive] and good quality then gamecube is it. Dont just take my word for it look at all the other great reviews for this game."
5,The GameCube is Great!,"The GameCube is the best gaming console out there! It has a wide variety of games and the best ones are coming out this fall. Who cares if it doesn't have a DVD player!! Get a separate one if it means so much. Many people don't like the GameCube because they say it's a ""kiddie"" console. GET A LIFE! XBOX stinks because the graphics are bad and there isn't a variety of games. I think the PS2 is better than XBOX but it still isn't as good as the GameCube. Face it, Nintendo rules the gaming industry and there is nothing Sony or Microsoft can do about it."
5,BUT IT BUY IT BUY IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Some people say that the GC is for little kids but it's not,it'sfor adults and kids not like xbox it practicly only for 18 and upPlus the GC has a fair share of games the one I like and want themost is sonic adventure 2:battle it's really cool!!! Three reasons to buy the GC, ONE:The combo GC can hook up to gameboyadvance,playstation nor xbox can do that. TWO:More kid friendlygames as in more games that are for everyone,but also games for teens and adults. Three:Great graphics for instances sonic looksawsome and the sound amazing plus great quality!All in all parents and kids who are looking for a great and compact system super graphics and great sound this is the systemfor you!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! P.S. I forgot to mention it's cheap so it's an ideal gift for chirstmas!!!"
5,Growing Giant,"Just as the Atari Jaguar, a system three times as powerful as the Super NES, fell to Nintendo, so will Microsoft's ""gem"" crumble before the giant. Look at history. Nintendo has always had competitors trying to steal the crown in the gaming industry. But if you think about it... What is the only company that has been around decade after decade? Atari, Neo Geo, Turbo Grafix, Sega, Sony... They've all come and gone, and so will the XBox... But Nintendo will stand for a long time.The GameCube IS starting out slow. There is a noticable lack of games. But the games that are coming will shape the foundation of future gaming, and they will come from Nintendo; they always have. ...You'll see."
3,"Pretty good, Good system if You Like Nintendo","All i would like to say is that i think that the Nintendo Gamecube is a pretty good system. It has great graphics, fast loading times, and a pretty comfortable controller and thats basically all it has. There is not that much games that are of good quality and much are, sorry to say, in the ""kiddie"" genre. If you really want my opinion, I would go with a PS2, it is only slightly better because it has superb games in all genres, and a DVD if you dont already have one. I personally would not get an Xbox for the same reason i would not get a Gamecube, because of its lack of games."
2,Extremely Disapointed,"I anticipated the Nintendo Gamecube to be a great release. I went out and bought it on Nov. 18, the release date. I bought Rogue Leader, and enjoyed my Gamecube for about a month. I became bored with my Gamecube because of the quality of the games for pre-teens and teenagers. I understand the Nintendo is now focussing on a young audience, and probally won't produce many games for an older audience. For anyone over 13, my recomendation is not to buy the Gamecube, you will become dissapointed with the games. I sold my Gamecube and got an X-box instead, which I think is a much better machine, and a better buy for anyone over 13."
2,Not real good,"I played gamecube for a while and this is what I thought of it. THE CONTROLLER IS WAY TO HARD. Graphics aren't nearly as good as Xbox. They do have some good games though including Super smash Bros. melee,Soccer slam and Mario sunshine but other then that it stinks. But rememberXBOX RULES!"
5,I Love my Game Cube!,"I had no doubts about this system when I got it for Christmas, thankfully I was not let down. The controls are exellent, I got used to them when I first put it in my hand. I have been a Nintendo customer ever since I was four, and I have never been this pleased with one of thier systems. The graphics on this thing are MESMERIZING, plus all of the good games are coming out for Game Cube. X Box could never stand a chance against Game Cube..."
5,Gamecube {Better than XBOX},"This is one awesome console. In my opinion, it is much better than the XBOX. Why, you ask? 1)The controller is so much better2)Takes barely any time to load 3)More exclusive games 4) Won't CATCH ON FIRE5)MAde my Nintendo. Nuff saidOkay, sure the XBOX is made by Microsoft, but they aren't the best pros at making games and systems. This is the best console (After the PS2) you can buy."
5,"GAMECUBE , THE BEST GAME CONSOLE!",I bought the gc 4 months ago with wresthlemania 18 and supersmash brother melee and it was the bomb.at first i thougt it was corney then i bought a memo card(251)and it was so hottnot only does it have some hot games but it's graphics are unbelievable the bad thing is that it doesn't have any games with brock lesnar or rey.buy it.espeialy the sarter pack for just 30 bucks more
5,Very cute dvd,My daughter used to watch this video all of the time (she's now almost 6). She came across it again last month and wanted to watch it again and still said she liked it. It's very cute.
4,Why must Batman always be kid friendly?,"I've been reading negative reviews of Gotham Knight, and most of them center on the fact that it's not ""kid friendly"" enough. Why is this a requirement? If you want a Batman cartoon for kids, you can turn on cable at just about any time of the day, on any day of the week, and watch any one of the myriad series of animated Batman shows created for children. Why is this not enough? Why must every Batman show be for your child, even the ones that were, ostensibly, created as a tie-in for a mature-rated series? The rating system is there for a reason, folks. I don't write critical reviews for Wall-E for its lack of adult content, because that would be silly. Actually, calling it ""silly"" is putting it very lightly. Seriously, go rent ""Batman & Robin"" and leave just this *one* series be. Deal?"
2,Atrocious,I thought this was quite boring. Several different stories and all were pretty lame. The first story was barely watchable as the animation was well below par. The premise was good but overall not satisfactory as a Batman fan.
2,"Nice looking, but that's it","Nice looking, beautiful art-direction (but not animation)--The two stars are for that only and I think I am being more generous than I would have been if I had written this review after I watched it last week. The stories only loosely interlocked and were pretty inconsequential. I was on a Dark Knight high and rented this the next day along with Batman Begins and was thoroughly bored by Gotham Knight. I felt ripped off like I did with the Animatrix--Quick way to cash on a much superior work."
3,A Hit and Miss,"Batman Gotham Knight is basically like the Animatrix where only about 2 or 3 of the animated shorts are worth watching. The ones worth seeing here are the ones that actually have comic villians like Scarecrow, Killer Croc and Deadshot. The other shorts are just okay."
3,Good if you want to see Batman beat people up.,"I had very high hopes for this dvd, but wasn't very impressed. The new Batman seems to capture realism. which you wont get from these stories, most of it was very fake. The fact that there were 6 stories animated by 6 different people, and none of them really linking to each other made it hard to finish. Each one of the stories are good on its own, but its weird to see a young long haired Bruce Wayne then see and older wiser man on the next story.On its own, it is a pretty cool super hero animated show, but when i watch Dark Knight, I wont be able to bridge Begins, Gotham knight, and Dark Knight like i did for Star Wars II, Clone Wars, and III.In a nutshell, If you love Anime, and love Batman, Buy it, but if your just wanting to see a Batman Begins 1.5 your out of luck."
2,The Ultimate Movie Review! - [...],"I don't really care for animated movies...I like superheroes even less, but Batman is the exception, and when I read that this film bridges the gap between Batman Begins and the Dark Knight, while being written and directed by some of the same people, I got excited. Gotham Knight is a collection of six stories that supposedly tell us what Batman was up too, prior to battling the Joker in the Dark Knight. What I really love about Nolan's Batman movies is how realistic they are, and while Gotham Knight uses the same names and story line, it is anything but realistic. These stories are downright childish and boring. It's like reading Batman's diary and seeing his conversations and what he did at work today, some stories were better than others, but I was pretty much reading Batman's Twitter and it was as dull and simplistic as could be."
4,Pretty good if you're a Batman fan,"This is very similar to the Animatrix. It is a little short, but the stories and animation are quite good."
3,I felt ripped off,This was a compilation of anime shorts that borrowed heavily from the Nolan films. For us older fans it's perplexing to see the character rebooted so many times.
2,Hate the different types of animation,I'm a Batman fan. The story was good. The different types of animation just killed it for me. In one part Batman looks like Rambo and the next he looks like a Backstreet boy. I didn't like how some of the stories interlock and left me hanging. The art on the first story I didn't like but my kids did.
1,very dissapointed,"the only good thing about this dvd is kevin conroy back as batman. why do they continue to take a good thing like TAS, and ruin it with japanimation type cartoons. TAS was the true batman, its characters, their backgrounds, and the art work is so fitting and perfect. the animation to all the super hero dc comics films ahould be what bruce timm and company did with the original series. kevin conroy should be batman, forever. save your money and tell warner bros to stop this fancy type production and to go back to what works."
4,About What I Expected,"Beautiful, fun, and entertaining the only two areas this DVD falls flat are 1) it doesn't have a full story. Even if you take all the stories and put them together there wasn't a solid story to tell. Really the story was sort of an excersise in beefing up the background and less glamorous parts of the Batman universe. If you were to take all the stories as a whole the ending feels like a bit of a cliffhanger. 2) The special features don't interest me enough to make the extra cost worth my while. Yeah, if you are a big fan then of course it won't matter but for those who may be on the fence just think about getting the standard set ... you won't watch the rest more than once anywho."
2,"Nice story & backgrounds, but character design lacking.","I purchased this and was disappointed by it.First the good:* The DVD's do serve as a good bridge between Batman Begins and The Dark Knight.* Kevin Conroy does his usual excellent job as Batman's voice.* The voice talent in general does an excellent job.* The backgrounds and equipment designs are beautifully done.Now the bad: The characters are illustrated so poorly that it looks like the majority of the art budget was blown on the backgrounds. The teenagers in the first episode, for example, look like they were drawn by an artist using a half-melted ice sculpture as his reference. The quality of the character animation and illustration does NOT improve as the series progresses.Though not as poorly drawn as The Batman TV series, the apparent lack of effort put into illustrating the characters destroys all my enjoyment for this DVD series. It's too bad, because the voice talent, background illustrations, and storylines are all excellent."
2,Disappointing,"Fresh out of the theater from seeing The Dark Knight for the THIRD time and anxious for more...my son and I found ourselves very disappointed in this production. The animation, for the most part, seemed amateurish at best. I guess the best of the segments was ""Deadshot."" Some of the fight scenes were okay but it seemed that the majority of the focus was on background scenery development...very CG but good. Wish more of that could have carried over into the character development/animation. A little too ""artsy"" and overly styalistic in much of the over-all delivery. Most of the story-lines seemed choppy and random."
2,If Andy Warhol were to draw Batman,"I am not out to convince anybody of anything..When it comes to 'subjective' opinions people like what they like and it is a ridiculous waste of time to try to change their minds///My review is to warn people who, like me, favor 'traditional art', music and drama where you can always understand the dialog and the art makes sense.....The animation in this film is like walking through a modern art gallery, dark, and mumbled...But then I am one who never liked Frank Miller's distored bodies in his Dark Knight series....This film is for a particular taste but not mine....but I just may be an old foggie whose type is slowly vanishing from the scene..."
1,The worst in any of the Bat Man cartoons,The only good thing about this movie was the ending. From the beginning there was nothing that held my interest and it was a relief when it was over.
2,Not too good,This was Def. NOT a good buy..The pricing should've been more like 5.00- 10.00 New...It was a collection of short stories that were not very interesting...however the artist was on point if we were trying to see an AMERICAN hero from a japanese artist concept..ultimately...The product was in good shape upon arrival and delivery date was as well....i give this user and its dependability 3.5/5
1,Ugh,"I love anime. I love Batman. Therefore, this should have been a winning combination for me.After about the first twenty minutes, I had to shut it off. It didn't matter how much I might be missing...I just didn't have the patience."
1,Just Plain Awful,"This latest edition of the Batman cartoon features a series of mini episodes starring Batman. Supposedly these episodes within the dvd represent things that have occured between Batman Begins and The Dark Knight. By the way, I saw the Dark Knight, and it is totally awesome, so I'm not a Batman antagonist at all.But these episodes on this dvd are horrible. Bad stories, poor animation, lousy point of view and nothing to do with the movies. No plot, no story flow, no characterization, and nothing to keep my interest. It's too bad that the makers of this dvd wasted their time and ours, not to mention our money, as nothing can save this poor turkey from the garbage can it deserves. Even Batman with all his skills and gadgets would be hard pressed to save this dvd from a well deserved death."
1,major major disappointment !!!,"Put your money away,its got to be the worse batman animation I have ever seen.Trust me, you will be disappointed beyond belief. If its possible it deserves negative 5 stars."
1,NOT THE BATMAN I KNOW!,Let me start out saying this movie is not for kids. It has to much blood for one reason. The film actually curses as well. I thought this movie would be good but I was wrong. The movie first off has japanese animation which I do not enjoy. This batman seires has nothing to do with the comics. I read them. Let me just say this movie should be rated R. It has a stupid dialouge as well.
3,Good is you get past the anime speaking off rhyme voices.,Good stories. The animation is brilliant and crisp while the Japanese style anime voices throw it off. Only happens in some particular stories. Each story has a different Bat suit which is sometimes really nice and just strange.
2,Batman - Gothic(?) Super Hero,"This animated feature sees Batman do battle with, among others, Killer Croc. The animation is fine but a little tedious to casual movie fans. I wouldn't want to see it again."
4,Batman with a Japanese Twist,"This is one more product of WB's strategy to release DVD-only titles in parallel to theatrical releases in order to boost DVD sales, helped by the main movie. Instead of a full length story, what you will find in here in ""Batman Gotham Knight"" is six short animations which are not exactly interwined amongst themselves as the product description in the DVD case says (at least in my opinion), but six different stories on how Batman came to be who he is. It is not a mandatory bridge between ""Batman Begins"" and ""The Dark Knight"", but it is an interesting addition for fans.Why the ""Japanese Twist"" in the review title? Well, watch the DVD, look in the eyes of each character and you will get the answer. And if you still doubt about it, wait for the rolling credits in the end and see the names of each member of the production crew."
4,"Excellent Animation, Story lines OK","There are 6 chapters in gotham knight, each one with a different director and writers, and sometimes differnt animation styles. The animation in the last 5 out of 6 chapters was excellent.. The best batman Animation i've ever seen is in batman gotham knight.. On the other hand the chapters should have been longer with more character deveolopment. I didnt get to learn much of anything about the villians in gotham knight, many of the villians i've never seen or heard of in this edition.. My final conclusion, Animation excellent in most of the chapters. But the Story line needs more development"
2,Another animated feature to avoid,"I haven't been a fan of any of the DC or Marvel animated films. The animation is too flat or too much the same. the characters and story are not fleshed out at all. I had, however, high hopes for Gotham Knights. Its Batman after all. I'm not a big fan of Japanimation but was looking forward to the different visionaries taking on the project. The result was less than stellar. Stories are too short and the first handful move slowly, it barely features Batman (from his point of view at least) enough, it is a Batman film afterall, the look of Batman in some of the designs is pretty blah. The fight scenes are non-existent. Very disappointed overall. The last episode with Deadshot was good, however way too short. How does this film fit into the Nolan-verse of Batman? Go see The Dark Knight! Skip this dvd. I say with sadness of course..."
5,DC just keeps making great animated Batman films,"I loved watching different anime artist's takes on Batman. Each story is engaging and wonderful to watch. Some are obviously better than others and people will always have their favorites, but I don't think anyone can argue that they're all fun to watch. This is a great standalone and look amazing on blu ray."
3,"Six Episodes: Some Good, Some Questionable","I knew the DVD was six different episodes by six different animators. However, some of the animators were questionable. I'm not a big fan of anime and I wasn't a big fan of Bruce Wayne being depicted as the stereotypical skinny man you can find in any anime. In the first episode, the setting animation was amazing but the character animation was very odd. A few of the episodes in the DVD featured amazing animation all around and decent writing. Overall, I got this on a deal for less than $2 but if I had paid more I would be very tempted to return or trade-in this DVD. It was only okay, so I'm not sure what re-watch value it has."
3,Quirky collection of Batman stories,"The stories are hit or miss. There are some unique takes on the Batman character. Overall, these are well executed cartoons that carry on the Dark Knight tradition and while not envelope-pushing, do their share expanding the DK universe."
3,Batman: Gotham Knight Review (Part 1),"Batman: Gotham Knight is an interesting yet slightly uneven film that for the most part should keep fans of the Nolan Batman Trilogy entertained and even some of more hardcore Batman fan amused but with the different animation styles clashing with each other it falls into the same trap as ""Halo Legends"" yet unlike ""Legends"" this film does have a connecting plot. If you are looking for a more worth while Batman animated film I suggest the ""Superman/Batman"" films but if you're looking for a different look at the Dark Knight this will be a great investment. For a more in-depth review of each animated segment check out my Batman: Gotham Knight video reviews on YouTube at [...].- Jimmy Shell ""Super Nerd"" Host of ""Super Cinema"""
5,"Good condition, got everything I wanted.","Good seller, got everything I wanted.As for the movie, it is a good movie for a Batman fan. At times it's pretty cool that there are different animation styles for individual story clips but some were too cartoonish and it becomes an eyesore (ie the first animation sequence)."
1,Horrible,"If you're a Batman fan, avoid this; it's crap. Just terrible. A complete waste of time and money for an interpretation of Batman that is juvenile, to say the least. If I didn't have to make this review twenty words long, I would have stopped two sentences ago. Hope this helps."
3,False Advertising,If you look on the label it claims to be the first PG-13 animated move. This is false; Batman Beyond: Return of The Joker was the first PG-13 animated Batman movie.
2,Too Dark For Me!,This dvd of blended stories is just a mess! Sorry allof you who love the techno cartoons. The artwork isvery good but it's hard to watch and the stories arejust boring! Bad Idea! I purchased because Kevin Conroyfrom the animated series did the voice and was a goodchoice but it's nothing like that animated series. Theartwork made you feel you were reading a comic book andthe stories were well written and directed which is somethingthis dvd doesn't have. I know many of you will disagree butthere is something to keeping things simple and stop tryingto make cartoons seem like real people! Bring back the Batmanfrom the animated series and I'll buy it again! but not this!
1,Against all odds...,"For anyone who came into this DVD expecting it to be similar to Batman: the Animated Series...it's not.For anyone who came into this DVD expecting it to be similar to the Animatrix...it's not.For anyone expecting this to be worth watching...your call, but I don't think so.After watching it, it was HEAVILY influenced by Japanese animation techniques, and looks somewhat like a median between Avatar and Princess Mononoke. The mouths were never matched to what was said, and it was very dark.This style of animation had considerable amounts of blood (for animation), and I would not recommend this for children, even though I absolutely love Batman:TAS.Lastly, this DVD moved very slowly, with very little plot stretched out over a ridiculous length of time. It had some interesting shots, but overall, don't waste your time or money."
1,Not what you expect,Not all that great. I was really hoping for a pretty great story line with an infusion of anime & batman. What i got was a sub-par production of anime & a horrible storyline.the only thing salvagable is the extras on this thing. Showing you the history of the creater of batman (Bob Kane) and the parrallel of batman and his nemesis.
1,Animated Series Fans WILL Be Disappointed !,"I agree with everyone that gave this one star. Poor, poor, poor story lines. The shorts are supposed to fit together to present a bigger picture, but are disjointed. If you like Manga, you will enjoy the animation, but the first short is even too weird for Manga fans I think. Looks like someone under the influence of Scarecrow. If you gotta have it, borrow it from someone and copy it. I bought it first day out, now it's a bookend."
1,What the Heck?,Simply the worst graphics (Anime) ever used on a Batman story. I couldn't watch more than a few minutes. How could they release such crap!!!
5,Batman + anime directors = awesome,"Im not even a big batman fan (go Supes). But when you put a dark iconic hero with a dark story and mix it up with japanese animation and have the guys that gave us Ghost in the Shell, Spriggan and Ninja Scroll all involved... that can only be big things. They have me sold."
3,Batman in six acts,"This new Batman DVD has impressive looking animation, but I found the story somewhat frustrating to follow at times. The best of its six segments were those involving the villains Scarecrow and Deadshot (esp. the Deadshot tale), but others tended to be very artsy (such as the story about Bruce Wayne learning from a female sensei type). The opening sketch is clever in its use of the skateboard kids and their perspectives of Batman's encounter with an enemy, but it's also ineffective as a story since it tells little about who the criminal is, what he did, etc. In fact, all throughout the disc, I had a ""huh?"" reaction way too often, not understanding exactly what was happening or why."
2,Unimpressed,"I'm an avid Batman fan (over 500 Batman comics, all the movies, etc...) and I was extremely disappointed and unimpressed with this dvd. I had great hopes for this considering the creative team and having Kevin Conroy doing the voice, but it wasn't worth the money. Most of the animation was very distracting with the worst one being the bad army helmet that Batman wore in one the episodes. The story line wasn't very strong either."
1,Not what was expected,The movie appeared to be one single feature in a certain animation style once product arrived however it was something else entirely featuring a series of short stories in completely different and contrasting animation not true to the theme previously thought of in the description and not true to batman
3,Opened Package,"The DVD's package was open! It was advertised as new, so I though that it would come as such. Although the product was in perfect condition, it was not new. Other than that the interaction was good. The product arrived before the quoted date, so that was good."
3,Batman Gotham Knight,"Not going to rant and fill out a big thing. I am just glad I got it on Netflix, and did not pay money for this. I will watch anything Batman, and the story is not bad. The IDEA behind different art work I thoght was going to be cool, but half the time the art work is so bad, or so Anime that you can not recognize Bruce, that it is distracting. I was excited to watch it, and was very dissapointed."
3,"""Gotham Knight"" - Prequel to ""The Dark Knight""","Not a bad look at the Batman franchise, but the animation style may not be for everyone. The six stories included on the blu-ray are somewhat interesting. The picture quality of the blu-ray was ok, but looking at the animation sytle it couldn't of been much better. Also, there is no lossless sound included on the blu-ray.Buy for Batman fans, worth a rent otherwise."
2,"Disappointing, Preachy, Incoherent Hodgepodge","About the only thing that can be said in favor of this film is that the animation is often striking and beautiful. Otherwise, it suffers from all the defects of the animated series after Warner Bros. decided to turn it into a marketing gimic.The animated series as developed by Bruce Timm, Paul Dini and others was great, but once Warner Bros. realized they had a success they had to milk it for all the money they could: rework it for a younger audience, make it lighter, less dark and less intelligent.Gotham Knight is dark, but for the most part only in the visual sense. The story line is almost indecipherable -- pointless twists and turns, jumps -- a mess.The characters are superficial as is the annoying philosophizing.Someone like Alan Moore can pull this off. But Warner Bros. can destroy his work and they destroy whatever might have been good in Gotham Knight."
2,So-So,It is 6 short episodes..the 1st one sucks and only 3 of them are actually any good. Dead Shot was the best (the last) animation is ok. Definately NOT a must have.....
4,One of the Bettter Purchases,"I just recently bought this Dvd on amazon and it arrived more quickly than just about all the other Dvd's I ordered. It was really good. Good packaging, the animation is really cool."
5,Hardcore fans will enjoy,"Though short, Gothom Knight is a wonderful set and hardcore Batman fans should appreciate this."
4,Batman: Gotham Knight,Batman Gotham Knight (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)Interesting anime shorts and the second disk is full of great features
4,Not what was expected - but still good in its way.,"I was expecting several different animated episodes that would introduce characters and tell complete stories. What I got was several different animated episodes that were snapshots of events that helped shaped the Batman that we will see in the next movie. Not that there isn't a fair amount of action - but I can see where the stories seem ""incomplete"". It's because they are not meant to be tidy and complete but instead to show more of the psychology of the character. Once you get your mind around that fact, you can potentially enjoy the episodes on the level I think they were intended.Side Note: When I see things like this I LONG for a good ANIMATED PG-13 or R Batman movie. There are some things that live action/CG just can't do like animation!"
2,Blah,"I've been reading Batman (and comic books) since I was a kid. I'm 38 now. My credentials are legit and I feel more than qualified in rendering this review....I was bored. If you want to see an animated Batman buy ""Batman: the animated series"" seasons 1-3. That is Batman."
2,"Moderate entertainment, disjointed","I watched this with my boyfriend who wanted this as a birthday gift. He liked it, but he likes almost anything Batman.I don't like the way it was 6 separate stories animated by different people and put together as a single presentation. There wasn't much continutiy at all. I only saw where one story related to the other, though they were supposed to all be congruent.The first of the 6 stories was by far my least favorite. I really disliked the animation style, and the storyline was weakly executed.Honestly, the whole set seemed disorganized and disjointed, and while I was mildly entertained, I certainly wasn't thrilled or going ""wow.""That said, some of the animation is done extremely well and very life-like. I was impressed by that.The MSRP on this is ludicrous, and even the marked-down amazon.com price is more than this DVD is worth to me."
4,Great Movie,"Overall it is a good DVD set. You have to get used to the Japanese style of animation. I did not like the way Bruce Wayne was drawn. That would be my only real complaint. It was a pleasant surprise to hear that Kevin Conroy was back to voice Bruce Wayne/Batman. He was the same actor who voiced those characters in Batman TAS. The stories are good. The first one I believe is a loose remake of the ""Legends of Batman"" episode. Every kid has his/her own idea of who Batman is. What was cool is that their stories are all related and you catch a new piece of the story each time it is told. You also see how Batman experiments with new gadgetry and some of his training. Definitely worth it if you are a Batman fan and enjoyable if you are not."
2,I Really Hated This.,"I did not care for this at all!!The different animation and the stories were not really that impressive to me, and I kept thinking of all the amazing Bat stories they could be making into movies instead of this one.This was just disappointing. Your time is better spent watching Batman:Year One or Batman Under Red Hood. This is definitely not one I plan on watching again."
1,Gotham Naught,"All ""limited animation"", not like 'Filmation', but like scanning storyboards. Clutch Cargo was lively, frenetic, compared to these. And Weird (really weird.) Disappointed, Disappointing - but opinions vary 1-5."
4,Almost Perfect,"I was eagerly waiting for this dvd movie By DC Comics,the wait was worth it. The stories are great with the exception of the Deadshot onewhich was really hyped up before the dvd came out (see the special Features on the ""New Frontier"" dvd). This story was too short and felt very rushed.The Bonus disc has some great extras on it A Doc about Bob Kane and a Docabout all the batman villians.All in all Dc did a great job with this!!!"
4,Definitively Batman is for animation,"The last live-actor Batman is a demonstration of that. No matter the Oscar postmortem for Heath Ledger (who made a correct incarnation of the Joker, a character which is practically impossible to act, but not as much as the reviews says), this episodes demonstrate once again that, no matter the live actor movies lift up the bar, the animators can lift the bar a little bit more.I do like the first chapter, which is innocent, and like alot the rest of the numbers, specially the last one. Hope for more of this kind and more extensive ones."
2,"Stories are too short, not worth the money","I just bought the single DVD version and was psyched to see a dark Batman animated DVD coming out. Being a big fan, I had to get it. Bottomline, its not worth the money. Rent it first. The first story is horrible. The animation is off; Batman looks different in every story as does Bruce Wayne. Each story is only 12 minutes long so there's not enough to satisfy you. They'd be better off having fewer stories and making them longer. They probably just released this for marketing since the movie comes out next week. Too bad they didn't give us anything quality and just fluff to ""satisfy"" until the movie comes out. Avoid this if you can."
2,Disappointing,"Great animation, an interesting variety of styles, but unfortunately the loosely interlocking stories are just boring. All is not lost, however, with the excellent ""Legends of the Dark Knight"" episode from Batman: The Animated Series, which takes artistic license from both the 60's Batman TV series intro and Frank Miller's The Dark Knight Returns, and as one of the extras. The upcoming Wonder Woman feature looks much more promising than Gotham Knight actually turned out."
3,It was okay -- not great -- but okay....,"I had high expectations for this flick, but, I must say I was disappointed. The animation was mediocre, and the story was slow moving. But, it was very happy to have Kevin Conroy voicing the Dark Knight."
2,Not all that great....,"Consists of many shorts done in the Japanese anime style. It doesn't work. In some stories, Bruce Wayne absurdly looks like a skinny Japanese teenager. (It becomes even more absurd listening to Kevin Conroy's deep baritone emanating from a kid.) In fact, Conroy's voicing is the only redeeming quality to this disc. Seems to have been done on the cheap; most of the vignettes are junk, with poor stories, as if they assigned them to first-time directors......What I've never liked about anime is its focus on symbolism over storyboarding and character development. Batman walking thru flames is symbolic and a bit provocative, but it's no substitute for good stories.......also seems like they used the farm team for all voices except for Kevin's. Give this one a pass. DC Animation has plenty of other vastly superior titles to choose from."
4,Batman from a different concept,"I just watched the six short scenes of Batman Gotham Knight. Even though the lenght of video is short, the stories caught my eye but the first. The different types of pictures makes you feel like you are watching different stuff but then you realize that every scene is part of a big picture. It is not the best of all Batman works but I think this gives you some entertainment and a good time. Enjoy it."
3,Might want to watch it a second time,The whole story line of this I thought was good. You might want to watch it a second time though. The animation changes between 6 different artists during the movie. There were times I thought the animation of certain artists seemed very lazy. At certain points I was thinking that doesn't even look like batman it just looks like a fat guy in the suit. Nice thing about this I thought were special features (It had more special features of the 2-disc of Dark Knight). The thing I liked most about the special features is it had a few episodes of the Batman animated series from the 90's. If your around 19-23 it will bring ya back to those moments when you were little and that's always a good feeling. I just give it a 3 stars on the movie since it was short and I didn't like some of the animation (that's just an opinion though). I would rate the special features 5 stars. Definitely thought those special features were a win.
3,Pretty Good,"If you are a fan of everything Batman, then you will enjoy this set of animated shorts. Otherwise, don't feel compelled to watch it."
3,Good animation - just OK plotting,"The animation in this collection of shorts is in general pretty good. It just somehow lacks spirit - ironically, on the second disk, there are four really excellent Batman episodes from the acclaimed series which ran on the WB a few years ago (directed by Bruce Timm). While those episodes didn't have the production values of those on the first disk, they were much more cohesive and better plotted. If you like animation and Batman, I'd suggest investing in the four volumes of the Timm series."
2,Two words: rent it,"As a fan of past Batman animated releases -- especially Mask of the Phantasm and Mr. Freeze: Sub-Zero, I had to see this.Some of the visuals are very sumptuous, but some the character designs for Batman are quite ugly.Mainly this video falls down on the concept: trying to tell six short short stories in about 65 minutes. There isn't any room for character development, hardly any room for plot development.Unless you groove on watching the visuals over and over, the best advice I can offer is to rent it. Once. It's worth about a buck or two to see, but that's it. If I bought it, it would only gather dust on the shelf."
2,Not bad but not what I expected,"I have seen bettter and I expected better. The concept was good, but the first story was done already. The animation in one made him look to young. A problem I have with anime all the characters look like teenagers even the characters who you know are or should be older. Some of the animation looks as if a child did it. I know it is a matter of taste it just wasn't mine. Anyway I could say more but my overall suggestion, save your money, wait for it to come on the Cartoon Network or WB. Just my opinion....8]"
4,WHAT HAPENS AFTER BATMAN BEGINS AND BEFORE THE DARK KNIGHT,the movie was awsome as 6 seperate stories a little to much blood but none the less very entertaining.
2,Don't bother,"This is just a strange little collection of Batman cartoons, where Batman looks all warped and wierd. There is not much consistency from episode to episode, other than Batman's voice. The episodes are short, yet slow, and rather pointless. The last one is the best, but still nothing too memorable. Aside from some good visuals here and there, there is really not much to latch onto with this. It's a real snore. While I regret WB putting this thing out, my biggest regret is my decision to buy it."
1,Batman BeBop,"If you are Batman fan this is not for you. Animation reminded me of Cowboy BeBop and Ghost in the Machine, well done but not Batman. Nothing existed of the actual Batman. In each of the segments Batman is more of a weapon than an actual character. No cunning only prowess and fists. It really misses the mark. As a fan of the TV Series, the Movies and the many cartoon series, this is too Anime for me."
2,Nothing New. Bleh. Fell Asleep.,"Ugg. Another hyped Batman product. I was excited to see this new take on the Batman character but once I realized about ten minutes in that it wasn't going to get any better I lost interest quickly. Bleh. From the first story you are aware that'll probably put you to sleep. I can just imagine the pitch meeting. We'll make Batman hip for today's youth! Get skateboards and have kids talkin' ""street jive"" tellin' their Batman stories. Uggg. It's pretty bad. Save your money. We'll all lose interest as soon as the new movie comes out. Bleh."
3,"beautiful, poorly bound book","the book itself has beautiful pictures and is a great resource for the taiko enthusiast no matter the experience level. I will say though, that the binding on every copy I've seen is terrible. I'd advise punching holes and putting it in a binder if you wish to keep it together."
2,Cat Who Series Revisited,"I would hate for anyone to read this book and base their judgement of Braun's wonderful series of mysteries on it. This is a cute little ""gift"" book for dear friends who love their cats more than anything else, and who like reading about the personalities of cats. For those of us who have read and loved the ""Cat Who..."" series I am afraid this book does not hold much draw."
2,Too short,"An avid fan of the Cat Who series, I was dissappointed in ""The Private Life of the Cat Who..."" book. I had expected (and hoped) for detailed insight & feelings from Qwill's observations and day to day interaction with his feline companions. Instead, I got just a few brief notes on events I had already read about. If you're looking to get into the Cat Who series, pick up any of Lilian Jackson Brauns' books, just dont start with this one."
1,A Complete Waste of Time and Space,"Who wrote this book and why? I have read and loved all the Cat Who books, but this one didn't seem to make any sense. It rambled on and on about 100 different subjects - disjointed and with no rhyme nor reason. (in spite of all the little rhymes Braun included) Some reviewers find it a delightful compilation of snips from previous books, but I find it boring and meaningless. It read like the notes for a REAL book. Don't bother."
3,Sticky brown sludge,"Length:: 0:30 MinsBased on the microwave method.This side dish is very easy to prepare, and takes only 10 minutes. All you need to add is water and maybe a tablespoon of margarine.Taste wise, it's fine - even comforting on a cold or rainy day, but be warned that it looks NOTHING like the picture on the packet, which was taken of a professional pasta model with full make-up and airbrushed to boot.Sorry to say it, but the finished product actually looks like a bowl of sticky brown sludge, with the consistency of swamp mud.Kids will probably love it for the above reasons, but please don't go serving this when your boss is coming to dinner.Amanda Richards, October 12, 2007"
4,Finally!!,I have been looking for the Beef flavored pasta sides for ages and in every grocery store I have gone into! I am so happy to find them and purchase them on Amazon!
3,It's ok.,"The controller is very poorly designed, the D-Pad is a tiny little mess, completely wrong. Some cool ideas are implemented, but it seems to try to look cool more than be functional for your hands. The system itself is fairly powerful, they should lower the price, being it's tied with, I think, PS2. The biggest downside to a Nintendo machine is the lack of games, this first year out, they have nothing but commercial trash cash-ins, there are exceptions: RE and Mario. They also finally admitted that RARE is leaving for Microsoft and won't make any games beyond Star Fox. They will continue to delay games and I wonder if we will see the quality found in the first few years of N64 again, many titles seem to have gotten off-track. Overall, you can have a lot of fun, just be willing to put up with Nintendo's constant BS."
5,"Watch out XBox and PS2, the CUBE is going SQUARE!","Thats right, squaresoft is currently working on a Final Fantasy game for GameCube and it's handheld counterpart the Game Boy Advance. You're gonna want to buy a link cable (GBA to GC) for this game!"
3,Great Graphics but Got Games,"Don't listen to all the things this guys say (nothing but Fan boys), this console lacks of good games, the only good games are Resident evil, Eternal Darkness and Smash Bros melee (Already got bored with this one) and the rest are just ports that other consoles have.I only recommend this console to Nintendo Freaks and those who already own a Ps2 and want to complement there colection whit some extra games."
4,I love the game cube,"The gamecube is aswome. Denfitly the games like bloody roar,Super Smash Brothers Melee and NBA 2K2. The new wireless controller is cool because you could play from 30 feet and any were in the room. But I would wish that they could make a 59 memory card in the gamecube because it took us 2 months without saving the bloody roar data. I like the gamecube because it's portable. Now I could my video game at my friend marks house."
2,"C'MON, let's get something new here.....","Well...I see no difference here than from any other Nintendo product. I mean C'MON!!! Hasn't there already been 100 nintendo systems... Who cares about how good the graphics are, that's all that changes for nintendo.Get some new games. All I here from Nintendo64, Gamecube, and other nintendo stuff is always Mario, Luigi and Pokemon. Thats all Nintendo has.Look at psx and ps2, they've got over 100 or even 200 games maybeNintendo products would be a little bit better if they got more games."
1,Nintendo should be ashamed,"Nintendo used to be the one and only console maker. The NES and SNES were wonderful consoles. I still play old Mario and Final Fantasy Games. The Nintendo 64 started Nintendo's crash, and the GameCube will finish it. Take a look to what has happened to Zelda and Mario to understand. The makers of Zelda have abandoned all sanity by transforming Link into an ugly, bratty-looking kid. Mario is now saving the world from pollution? The games are ridiculous, and Nintendo should be embarassed."
1,Nintendo SUCKS!!!!,"Ok let's get the facts. When diehard gamecube fans say things like the PS2 will get weaker and weaker, that's not true the PS2 keeps getting stronger because it has the greatest and most variety of games--- a known fact. another fact is that people say the the PS2's are selling so much beter than gamecube and Xbox because of DVD, isn't true. People realize that the DVD function may not be the greatest, but they buy the PS2 for the games. People also say that the PS2 has a weaker game play quality and graphics- take a game like Virtual fighter 4- that has a greater polygon rate. so before you buy any system look at both sides of the story!!"
2,This console is just [poor],This console has NO games. Wow Star Wars Rogue Leader and Super Smash Bros. Melee. Shure there will be more games out but they're going to be [bad]. Zelda's new look means more like that in the future. Just get a PS2 or an Xbox. They're WAY better. Have you seen Sony change their characters looks? I think not! This console is going to be dead in the next 2 years. Just watch. No one is buying them.
5,Gamecube Baby,"o.k so there is a new console from nintendo.about the console wars everybody is immature about it. this reason is all about a matter of an oppinion.ok back to the gamecube. it has 128 bit graphics which is the best yet. ?the best game(in my oppinion),a must have,but not the only reason to buy a gamecube is, SUPER...SMASH...BROTHERS ...MELEE!!! lol.of course there are other good games like sonic adventure2 battle. Remember, the console wars is just a matter of opinion.so........ HAPY GAMING!!!"
3,It's the new N64,"Only buy this system if you MUST play Nintendo's first-party developed games. They have the least third-party support out of any of the systems. I fyou don't mind waiting 6 months in between waiting for good games or mostly playing ports that can be played on any of the systems than get it. It's really funny how many people are saying ""it's not for kiddies"" when half of the reviews on here are from ""a twelve year old gamer""."
1,"dont buy this, its for kiddies","If you are 6-14 years old, then by all means by it. You'll love all the kiddie games. If you like MATURE games or even TEEN games for that matter... then buy an XBox. And parents... if you are worried about your little kids getting adult content... please remember that the XBox is the ONLY system with built in Parental Control."
5,recomended games,"If you get this you might as well think about getting a game unless you want to fool around with stereo and mono etc. I sudgest starwars rouge squadron 2 rouge leader ,SSX trickey (i know it could have a better name but it'll have to do),sonic adveture two battle, super smah bro. melee , and pikmin(you might not like it if you can be a bit nervous."
5,GameCube,"Why buy a GameCube? Well, here are several reasons why you should:1) Extremely compact and it's the most aesthetically pleasing gaming system to date (supports mobile monitor).2) More powerful than the Playstation 2.3) Possibly has the most anticipated games comming out in the near future (Zelda, RE Zero/4, Mario Sunshine, Turok, Metroid Prime, etc).4) Resident Evil (aka Biohazard) series is a GameCube exclusive. This means that all of the classic RE titles and new ones will be released ONLY for the GameCube (Does not include RE:Online).5) SquareSoft supports GameCube = Final Fantasy games galore!6) It's a great bargain for...(Starter Pack).I could list another thousand reasons, yet I believe I've made my point. So what are you waiting for, buy one now!"
5,ITS NOT A KIDDIE SYSTEM,"Look, everyone thinks this is a kiddie system, it ain't. Yes it does have some games that are geared towards everyone, kids and adults, but please its not a kiddie system. If you want kiddie games go to the Playstation, yes, playstation. There the ones with all the digimon and barbie type games. Resident Evil has been held as the number one scariest game of all time and the gamecube has other games like eternal darkness. I would just like to give you a few reasons why this is the best system:Zelda, Metroid, Mario, Resident Evil, StarFox, Mario Franchises (Melee, Tennis, Kart etc.), Rouge Leader, Final Fantasy (yes its coming back!), Pikmin, third party support, and in Nov or so there will be online support.Reasons why X-box is the best system:HaloReasons why PS2 is the best:Metal gear, Grand theft autoGet my point?"
3,THE NEW CLASSIC,"the nentendo gameqube is just what you would expect fromnentendo (with the exception of the discs) but after I comparedthe three systems (nentendo,Xbox,& PS2)xbox was the supiriorSystem."
3,Good but not great.,When looking at the GC you need to keep in mind that this is a system geared towards the younger crowd. That's not a bad thing in and of itself but it does help keep things in perspective when comparing systems.As for the system itself my only complaints are that the memory cards have a very limited amount of space and the first party controllers are not very well made (the buttoms aren't pressure sensitive and the dpad is TINY!).Overall I would only recomend the GC to younger gamers or anyone who is a longtime Nintendo fan.
5,Great Product!,"I love it, I always get compliments on it and it's been durable! One of the buttons has a harder time buttoning the other, but it will button so that's what matters. The chain is detachable, which is always handy and it has plenty of room for business cards inside."
4,Good book for the Very Young,"Mississippi author Dot-t Ehmer, has written a simple yet elegant book for the very young who have to face the reality of death. Dehmer's book, The Best Part, is appropriately named, as it explores such things as oysters, the sky, and many other beautiful objects that children find appealing. The Best part offers a great deal to readers through child-like ideas expressed in both text and color illustrations. this book explores the evolution of all things, including people. Additionally it explains how after one has left the earth, we still remain, through memories-""the best part.""The text is simple, but has a strong message. The illustrations are so vibrant one can nearly feel the energy from the page.I would recommend it for children up to four dealing with death."
4,Quintessential Cleo,"Hey, what can I say?.......the best of aptly describes it. A gossamer voice that makes you think of a dark, smoke filled piano bar. The only thing better than the CD would to be actually listening to her live."
3,Interesting,It's not a great book but not a bad one either. Too many unnecessary characters bog down the plot. Good story idea but could have been better.
3,Cold Fear,"A young girl, Paige, disappears while on a camping trip and a multi-agency task force launch a massive search while also investigating her parents as the authorities are unsure if she did in fact disappear or if something more sinister took place.The book had all the right elements and the author is clearly talented so I am giving it 4 stars as it is worth reading. But I felt it was a little long drawn out in parts. I think this is due to the fact that he tells too much about each new character rather than allowing them to develop as he tells the story."
3,Okread,"This book was a bit slow. It didn't,t have much of a story. I am glad it was free. Ok for a light read."
3,Ehhh,"Very good, gripping you at the beginning and at the end. Unfortunately, the middle was a lot of unnecessary description and ramble. I understand what the author was trying to convey, yet, I found myself somewhat bored."
5,You won't want to put it diwn,This was the first time that I have read anything by this author and this book was one of those that you start and can't put down. Definately recommend this book.
5,cold fear,"I enjoyed this book, found it very interesting, scary and full of details. i was realy sad when i finished the book.i would recommend the book to anyone"
3,"GOOD, BUT NOT WORTH THE COST!","I enjoyed this novel of survival and suspense from Rick Mofina, but I don't believe it was worth the seven fifty. In some parts of the novel, it just dragged on and moved slowly. I thought it was odd that the police just assumed Doug and Emily were guilty for the disappearance of their daughter because Doug cut his hand on the ax. I also felt that the jail break and the chase after, Doug and Emily's daughter, Paige, was kind of thrown in there just for the end. In some ways, this novel left the author wondering a lot about why the family even bothered to go on this ridiculous camping trip. If you want to read a novel about surviving in the wilderness and surviving mental breakdowns then read this novel. If you are a hard-core suspense fan, then SAVE YOUR TIME & YOUR MONEY!"
3,Ok,"Anticlimactic . Long, drawn out, with no twist.Same story could have been written with half the space... make it a two."
3,Cold Fear,"This book is much more cerebral than I expected. I had been reading more action packed books, and this was a change. It moves slowly, with a lot of attention paid to relationships between different law enforcement agencies, and between law enforcement and the media. However, it keeps your interest. You become very interested in the characters, and want to know what becomes of them."
3,Cold start,"Cold Fear is 465 pages long & finally, after 200 pages it takes off. When it got good, it got really good!"
4,Gripping Thriller,"Cold Fear is a book which will grab your interest from the firstsentence and will not let you go until you have solved the mystery along with the author. Considering this is only his second book to be published in the mystery line, it is absolutely wonderful and most gripping. You will not want to put the bookdown once you have started reading it. The plot is relativelyeasy to follow despite the suspense it creates as the writer weaves the plots.Don't miss this one"
3,Good quick read,"Fast paced read kept me interested. First Mofina book I have read, I will definitely look for more authored by Mofina."
4,Nice suspenseful story,"I really enjoyed Cold Fear because I was engaged in the story the whole time and had problems putting the book down. Aside from a few grammatical errors in the story, from missing letters in words to quotation marks in the wrong place which made the story difficult to read on occasion, I am sad the book ended. Overall a great story that had my adrenaline pumping from the first couple chapters"
3,Cold fear review,Good book ...seemed a bit obvious but had some good twists at the end.Overall I enjoyed the book and author's style.
4,Just a little rich. . .,"I really like everything about the product, even though it is a trifle ""rich"" for my digestion, so I don't eat it as often as the rice dishes. However, like the other ""sides"" dishes, it is easily and quickly prepared, stores nicely, and am glad it's also on the ""subscribe & save"" list. Will continue to purchase it."
1,Salty,"This product (Noodle soup) has too much salt in it.Let's ssee more ""lower salt"" items.Thanks.Jim S."
3,Mike Tysons Heavyweight Boxing,"This game blows ko kings 2002 away!!!, Its more true to boxing and the technics.Unlike ko kings cheesy punches and blocking Tysons has tons of punches and combos that are fluent and REALISTIC. Ko Kings has alot of boxers but [weak] play!!"
4,Great Multiplayer,If your looking for some eclectic multiplayer action than beach spikers is the game for you. It is an overall pretty good game but the single player mode is too easy and it's hard to play it for a long time in a row. The gameplay is exactly like that of Mario Tennis for the N64. There are limited controlls and short games which can either be a downfall or a thrill. In this case they're a thrill. Because it is easy to get the feel of the game it is okay to play with a rookie. There are also mini games available in multiplayer. Beach spikers is wicked fun but please don't buy it expecting to play for 12 hours straight. I say it is worth a try.Rattings out of 10Fun 9Graphics 10 (Beautiful characters)Sound 5
3,Real Volleyball,I'll take this one over DOA:X any day. It's a REAL VOLLEYBALL game. A damn good one too.
4,Could sacrify a little sexyness for gameplay,Pros:1. Cheap2. Good Graphics3. Digs/sets/spikes accurateCons:1. Menus too deep and complimented for quick play2. Slow between points3. Blocking = awfulIf you want a decent volleyball game for a good price buy this game.Also if you have little kids who you may want to be careful because it has a sexual undertone.
4,Beach Spikers is too much fun! PSYCHE!,"Beach Spikers is hot, hot, hot! You play as a really sexy girl who plays volley ball on the beach, choose your country, edit your girl and your teammate, first thing is that your friend is not so good at the sport plus she's really a dumb ..., but as you play and give her complements she'll be inspired to become better! Beware the American team, they may be the sexiest team on the beach, but don't get hypnotized by their looks, they're real bomb spikers! I personally give this 8-out of-10 but 5 stars must settle!"
1,WORST GAME ON THE GAMECUBE... EVER.,"This is the WORST game I have ever played on the GC - which is sad since I'm a bit of a nintendo fanboy. I own every nintendo console that has been released in the U.S. - even the Virtual Boy. That said I have 37 Game Cube games at last count - and this is the worst I own. I gave it an honest try - >1 hour attempts on multiple occasions - but I just couldn't get into the game. The controls didn't make sense to me and the graphics weren't enough to hold my attention - even though some of the characters were ""stacked."" I only paid [...] for it used at Gamestop - and STILL felt ripped off."
2,An ok game,This game is pretty fun. Yet sega spent all there time on sex appeal on the characters they forgot what the main point of the game was... volleyball.
2,DECENT,"This is game is alright. I played a sample of it. Graphics are not that good, and the gameplay is alright. If you like volleyball i guess i would recommend it for you, but it really isnt that good. Even thought they are two different kinds of games but if you are looking for a excellent game for Gamecube, i would say the best game is Enternal Darkness. It has everything."
2,Babes on the Beach!!,"The only good thing about this game is the characters, who are teams of babes in bikini. Sounds good huh? NOT!!! This game is about volleyball, problably the worst sport in the world. The graphics look great, but it doesn't bring much attention to me. If you want a horrible but babe game buy it!"
1,Dreadful Cookbook,"I am an avid cook and cookbook collector and this is one of the worst cookbooks I have ever purchased. The author must not have tested the recipes. The stews are like water, the Monte Cristo makes enough liquid to flood a bathtub and, if you follow the directions, the thing never firms up. All in all, I tried five different recipes and ended up throwing the cookbook away, to the applause of my poor family. Save yourself the money. Don't buy this book. Instead, consider ""Stylish One Dish Meals"" or ""The Big Book of Casseroles"" - both FILLED with wonderful treats."
2,Lansky Medium Hone for Serrated Knives,This alone cannot sharpen knives. From the description I thought it could. It turns out that this is only one part of a set that is needed. The set costs over twenty dollars.
5,Fantastic DVD,This DVD is super and shows what a trip to Tibet should be like. I hope that one day i get a chance to go to Tibet in the presence of a spiritual expert like Lama Zopa Rinpoche who can transform a sight seeing tour into a mystic journey.Lama Zopa's explanation of all the holy places in the DVD was inspiring and the DVD really conveys the special quality of the places when viewed from a different angle. The soundtrack was fantastic and the sights will remain in my memory until I see them for real.
5,Pipers Play On!,"I highly recommend this video to anyone who loves bagpipes. The photography is excellent, the speakers moving, there is history to be learned--and some tears to be shed. What an awesome instrument the bagpipe is and how awesome too are some of the people who have played it. The soundtrack is also worth purchasing! It helped my Christmas shopping this year."
4,debating on the book,all i have to say is that this is a great book for information and i recomend it.
4,That's some zing!,"So far, I have thoroughly enjoyed all of the teas in the ""zinger"" series. I like Celestial Seasonings in general. Of course, the tea bags have no strings and that is something of an annoyance, but other than that, the teas are tasty and enjoyable. Zinger really is a great description of the product. It has a surprising and deeply flavorful taste and an aroma to match. It is a great option for those who enjoy herbal teas."
3,Where's the lemon?,"A great tea product as always; however, I was hard pressed to detect the lemon flavor in this."
5,Celestial Seasonings Tea,My Favorite Flavor and brand. So glad I can order it thru Amazon. Some stores don't carry the lemon flavor.
4,A Good Man Is Hard To Find,"Zippy Larson's fascinating book simply is not for everyone. Those women who are still living happily in the fairy tale belief that ""someday my prince will come"" probably will not benefit from this book. However, any woman who has seen the error in that kind of thinking will find Zippy's book very instructive. This is a how-to book based on the real success of the author and it gives the how, when and where of want-ad searching. Zippy tells us what to do and how to do it but, best of all, she tells us how to maintain control of the situation and stay safe while doing it!! It takes a lot of hard-nosed realism, grit and determination to follow in the author's footsteps but, ""a good man is hard to find"" so it's worth the effort."
4,las vegas got some heat,"i like this record because it's versitile and a throw back to the way rap should have always been raw,diffrent,tight beats and they talkin some real stuff."
2,The whole thing drug on,The story drug. The mystery drug. The main character drug on and on as she bumbled through the book. The ending drug. Etc.
1,Cute but not practical,Really wanted those old dial phone but i saw this and i thought how cute that its a modern version of the old one. Unfortunately the phone has its faults that its quite annoying for me. The phone handle does not securely sit on the phone. Thinking of either adding a velcro on it coz I keep knocking it out. Its also hard to set the handle back. The phone is also very fragile. When youre fiddling with the cords people can actually hear it from the other line. If you want it for design only and not practicality go ahead and use it!!! I give it a 1 star for design.
2,GE corded retro phone,"this phone has some good features, but this is a difficult phone. not at all user-friendly. virtually impossible to dial out as the keypad is poorly designed."
4,much more fun than a standard phone,"with all the health risks of cordless phones, we have gone entirely corded in our house. this phone is a pleasure to look at and to use; true, it is rather lightweight and tends to slip as one dials, but a piece of plastic matting i've used for yoga and putting under area rugs to keep them in place solves the problem."
4,Second purchased,This is my second RCA Corded Retro Phone. I now have one downstairs in my office and upstairs in my media room. It is an excellent choice of a high quality and low cost retro phones that incorporates current technology. The only issue is that you should immediately change the cord to a longer one. That is the only weakness. It works without any issues utilizing the Comcast VOIP.
3,Better lit numbers...,The phone is smaller than I thought. I'd like for the numbers to be illuminated so it can be used without turning on a light.Sounds is clear.Quality is good.
2,"Looks great, But does it work?","The Phone looks great. It rings when someone calls. You can dial out. You get a dial tone. But oops, no one can hear you when you are talking. You can hear them but they can't hear you. I called the 1-800 # to ask what might be wrong. Of course I put new energizer batteries in it, I plugged it up right. It has to be the part you talk into. I'm sending it back. Hope I get one that actually works."
2,numbers dont light up,my husband hates this phone because the numbers do not light up at night when you are trying to dial. Only the caller ID is lit. The style is really cute but we dont use it now.
4,Retro phone,I am satisfied with my land line phone. My children were amazed by the design. It is growing on them.
3,Cute Retro Phone,"The Retro Phone is definately a cute design to look at and the detailing has been well thought out. However, from a practical point of view it is a bit lacking. The phone does not have any weight to it and moves around the table too much (partly because the cord is not quite long enough). If the phone had more weight and would stay in position, then the cord would stretch.Also, because of the shape of the handset it is impossible to rest it in your neck, making it difficult to use your hand while talking.I am keeping the unit because i don't use my land line all that much and it looks cute on my desk for the infrequent times that it is needed."
4,RCA Corded Phone,"This is a nice phone. It has all the features of a cordless, plus the ability to work if the electricity is out. The caller ID and other such features still work because they run on 3 AA batteries. The biggest drawback is that it is too lightweight and tends to slide on the table top. I use a mouse pad to keep it from sliding around. I like it much better than a cordless because I can always find it."
1,Ruim,Péssimo cenário! Interpretaes sofrivéis! Vozes inadequadas para os papéis! E o cenário é tediante e feio! Estas interpretaes modernas descaracterizam a obra e retiram a beleza da composio e da idéia primária do autor!
2,"Fits well, but mirror glass vibrates constantly","This mirror replacement for the 1998 Jeep Grand Cherokee is a disappointment because the mirror glass vibrates even with engine idling and continues when driving. This causes an annoying blur of images when looking in the mirror. Not sure if the one I received is defective or this is a general attribute to this model. The product did fit as expected and is functional but significantly lacks quality of the original. Probably will return and look for a different model rather than replace with the same product. A video on youtube tremendously helped me understand how to remove the old mirror and install the new one, I highly recommend looking for it for any Jeep Grand Cherokee mirror replacement to learn how to do it."
1,My puppy chewed the corner off in under 2 minutes,"I was so excited to have maybe found a toy that would last my 8 month old puppy longer than a few hours. He loved the fire hose flyer; to pieces. I handed it to him, he took right to it and before I could finish throwing away the wrapper it came in, he had a corner shredded. Bummer, guess I'll keep looking."
4,Very Pleasing Effects,"Good face scrub, especially for oily skin.It smells great and leaves the skin feeling very clean.It was recommended to me by a friend who has dry skin ! (worked for him too).Highly recommended and perfect for summer use."
1,High Density Can Liners 7-10 gal. 1000 ct. clear,"The price is right BUT the quality is poor. If you are using them for light weight use, then these bags will be fine. I lifted them with something heavy and my fingers went through and the bag could not be used."
3,It's Okay,"Not a bad resurrection of the original. They did a good job of fine tuning the hall of famers, but it lacks the pep that playing todays players have. It's a shame we don't have a truly great football game in this day and age."
3,Not bad for the price.,I paid only $9.99 plus $3.99 shipping so this game was not so bad for the price. I just wanted a football game that I could play. This game is kinda boring though because there's no league and you just play against the other team that you pick to play against. You can pick about 11 football players to be on your team that are really good players. Like Joe Montana. After awhile this game gets boring. I just bought it and I'm already bored. It's just fun to play with when you wanna play one on one football.
1,Not the 2K of old!,"If your buying this game with the vision of the dreamcast version of 2K football in mind, stop now and save your money! This game has some good points but it is not worth sixty bucks, or good enought to rent. Also keep in mind that I am not a Madden lover giving 2K a bad name, but a dissapointed consumer being forced to wait until 8/14 to buy Madden as a last resort!"
3,apf 2k8 is king,better than any madden. graphics were amazing. the only downside was it does not have a halftime and postgame like nfl 2k5.
5,Your Child Has a Disability,I use this book as a reference tool for children who have disabilities. The book is written in clear and concise language for anyone to understand. Many of my college students who work with young children have purchased this text. Excellent .... I recommend this book for anyone who wants to learn more about children.
5,Another Game Novel,"I really enjoyed this book, not only for it's content, but the print was larger and so was the book. It was easier to handle and for those of us over 50 the print has been getting smaller and smaller.Flame is one of the girls enhanced by Peter Whitney. She is a match for Gator. It seems Whitney may or may not be dead and, he may have planned for the two groups to meet and mate. Anything is possible for this weird evil genius.Not only do we have these two people meeting, we have several sub plots going on. This adds considerably to the smoothness and interest in the story. I was unable to put it down.I really liked the inclusion of others. Some of the first books in this series are good, but you feel each person is not a team player. In this book, they were, and it added so much more to the story."
5,WOW,"Gater is a wonderful character. He is the kind of man that makes a womans mouth water. Night Game is a book that can be re read and enjoyed each time. This is the best book in the Ghost Walker series. I can't wait for the next one...Each book has gotten better and better. This book almost sets the pages on fire. How could the next one be any hotter.The mind of Feehan creates the kind of man every woman dreams of. And Gater is almost perfect.This is a great read with wonderful characters, very vivid setting of the bayou and great images of the other ""stuff""."
1,Over and Over,"This book had some promising moments early on. The sequence where Flame steals from the local bad guy and tracks Gater back to his house was the best of the whole book. After that we went round and round with mostly background filler. The explanations of ""enhancement"" are given in every chapter. Yes, we get how Flame thinks Whitney is still alive and she's never going back. Wait, tell me again. Sorry, couldn't finish the book which is too bad cause I love a good series. I suggest the Black Dagger Brotherhood by J.R.Ward & early Anita Blake by Laurell Hamilton."
3,Probably more like 3.5 stars!,"""Flame"" Johnson has a secret, and while trying to remain in hiding, she finds herself fighting her attraction to the very sexy, rugged, Special Forces agent, Gator Fontenot. As they both learn to trust each other, Flame learns the origin of her destructive powers, and struggles with the knowledge that her destiny may be already written in stone. Fighting to accept his growing feelings, Gator sets out to protect Flame at all costs. However, the question that always in front and center for Flame is ""Is Gator what he appears to be""? Or ""was he sent to bring her back to the man she most fears""? And finally, ""Is the evil Doctor Whitney, who created them both, still alive and shaping their futures, not just their pasts""? Over all, this was an easy read, and I would like to see more of the ghostwalkers in the future."
3,Pretty interesting.......,"At the beginning of the story, it was pretty interesting and a bit bland to me, but I wanted to finish reading the book.It got pretty interesting toward half of the book. The only problem that I have is......well the sex scenes. Well, the reason is that the one scene that Flame loses her virginity, she had sex like how many times? Not regular sex but some kinky sex... Well, Feehan didn't write out those scenes....but implied that they used sex toys.....paddles.....eggs vibration or something like that??? wtf??!! 0-0I like the story lines for this Ghostwalker series.....but please.....ease off on the sex scenes.....I sometimes skip the sex scenes since they are a bit too much for me.God, are romance books is suppose to be all about sex? I never read a book that the couple had so much sex before!But overall, the book was okay...although I do prefer the dark series still..."
1,Didn't bother to even finish,"I read a little over half and then became fed up. Coming from south, south Louisiana (better known as ""Cajun Country"") and being the daugther of cajun parents, whose first language is Cajun French, I found the story insulting and completely off base. Did Freehan even bother to visit here and speak to the people? The descriptions of the land, swamp, and wildlife was so far fetch I wanted to laugh at the audacity of her. Then the french phrases and comments Gator made were rediculous. Most of them are what northerners think we say from cheaply made movies, but no one I know bother's to speak that way. Even the curse words she used are not ""cajun"" french, but France-french. Then the drinking, boats, bar fights, and going to schol and living in the swamp? Please! Have you ever even been to a swamp in Louisiana?I couldn't even enjoy the book with all problems I found.BOO!"
4,Christine just gets better and better,"This was a fun read. I finished in less than two days. I hate the new paperwork format and hope that this it not the way all paperbacks are going to be published. I look forward to Christine's next book - ""Dark Demon"" and hope its as well written and fun."
2,Not the best quality,"Have purchased Bestop products in the past so this is not my first experience...but not happy with this bikini top and windshield channel. Already had bikini top on jeep, don't understand why had to purchase new channel to make this top fit...consider this somewhat of a""rip off"". Quality of screws sent with channel were crap...had to go purchase self tapping screws that wouldn't break at the heads...bikini top does not fit in side channels as previous top did...would not recommend or purchase this top again."
3,Functionalism and Approaches to World Peace,"In a collection of essays Romanian born Mitrany, a historian and political theorist, presents his ideas about the voluntary cooperation of nations to create institutions with common interests. The author has been recognized internationally as the founder of the Functionalist Movement, also known as liberal institutionalism. His writings and views reflect the beliefs of world community and world peace in the 1940s. This book is a 1966 U.S. publication by Quadrangle Books, Chicago. Mitrany served as a professor in the Princeton Univ. School of Economics and Politics at the Institute for Advanced Study at its inception in 1933-39 and again from 1946-56. He resided in Great Britain at the time of his death in 1975."
5,Nice little stove.,I was looking for a multi fuel stove that could burn (unleaded) gasoline. I looked at the external tank models (like the MSR whisperlite) and many of the ones I looked at no longer were able to use gasoline. I really did not care for that style and all the messing around that is necessary with those external tank units. This one is easy to use and no assembly is required!
4,Pretty decent,"A pretty decent little stove.I never got it properly lit in the first try (although I used it countless times over the weekend).It always took 2-3 times. I had to pump alot to prime it every time, light it and then turn off, pump again and light it again.Mind you when it got started right it is very efficient but it always took a couple of times."
4,"lightweight, easy to use","This little sportster-style single burner stove is lightweight and easy to use. It settles down to blue cooking flame faster than any other coleman stove I have used.It's multifuel, burning coleman fuel, unleaded, or kerosene (with the provided generator). Coleman recommends using coleman fuel when possible to keep the generator clean and happy.This little stove puts out around 7500 btu, which cooks fine and is the normal output for most coleman single-burners. If volcano-like heat is more important than weight/size and the ability to burn kerosene, check out the 10,000 btu 533 dualfueler.The stove works flawlessly. I'd give it 5/5 if it the fuel valve and fuel/air tube were metal instead of plastic."
1,Too Stiff,I was not impressed at all with this slumber bag. The outside feels like a stiff plastic. It is not something I want my child sleeping in. I am going to take it back to the store and exchange it for a different slumber bag.
5,Complete Quality,Thank you for my recent purchase the Calphalon pan is just excellent quality and value for money..Thank you Amazon.
4,"so far, so good","Seems like a pretty decent pan thus far. The Calphalon has not come off at high temps, seems just dandy for stir-fryin'."
2,Double Fault,"To be blunt, this game did not live up to my expectations. The graphics are well below par. There are not very many options to choose from throughout the game. And, most importantly, it isn't very much fun. Try again Sega."
1,scratching scratching scratching,"Sorry, seems like I'm not the first person to get a bad copy of this game. All it does is make funny scratching noises when inserted into my PS2 unit. All other games I have ever tried work fine."
3,Good fun,"Good fun for playing with friends, but the graphics are not as good as in SmashCourtTournament."
5,Happy,I'm a Montessori teacher and purchased this product for my classroom of 3-6 year olds. It is used daily by the children and is a favorite work choice. It would be nice to be able to buy replacement parts if a prism is lost. I purchased this because one piece was lost from a set I bought last year.
3,Just okay,"The pillow is definitely much firmer than I expected. It took about a week to get used to, and I had a kink in my neck after the first couple nights. I think it may be a bit too high for my size. I still use it for now, and I appreciate not having to fluff up my pillow all the time. I think it may be better for back sleepers rather than side sleepers."
2,Too firm - disappointed,"Bought this for my husband because he's always trying to swipe my Tempur-Pedic pillow. This pillow had a good rating and was very affordable, I thought, for memory foam. If I'm correct, a memory foam pillow is supposed to conform to the shape of your head and neck while giving adequate support. However, this one is pretty firm and is about as conforming as a block of regular foam like you'd find in a couch cushion. I say spend the extra money for a Tempur-Pedic."
3,Memory Foam Contour Pillow,This pillow wasn't what I was looking for.......gave it to my son to use. Ordered another one from a different company for my use. My son loves it.
1,The motorized brush broke after 10 uses,"I bought this in August and thought it was the best little thing. It made cleanup so easy. I have pets and I really appreciated the motorized brush in picking up their fur from upholstery, etc. It's been UNDER 2 months now and the motorized brush just stopped working. I can't return it to Amazon because it's past the time frame. So, I'd say don't buy it because now it only does half of what it could do and it must be really poorly made."
2,Dust cup release button broke on first use,"I love the suction and cleaning power of this hand vac, but there is a design flaw in the release button on the dust cup. I can still use it if I hold it on with my finger or tape it, but it is a hassle. Returning it is a also a hassle, but I think I will have to."
1,many good aspects but ONE BIG PROBLEM,"Even after full charge or recharge the machine works for at most 7-8 minutes... Really nonsense. And it takes a long time to get recharged. Pity, because otherwise everything is fine: picks up dirt quite well. But that defect ruins the entire product. I did not return it in time, so I am stuck, although of course I can use it well for a few minutes..."
4,Still going after 4 years.,Needs a new filter. Has been dropped and kicked by the kids. Smashed. It has several cracks in the casing and yet it still sucks up everything well.Needs a new battery since the charge is not as long lasting. Still it is a tremendous little vacuum considering the carnage that has taken place on it in the last 4 years.
2,Stopped charging after a year,"This vac worked very well on everything. As long as you emptied the dust every 3/4 uses, it also kept very good suction. It stopped charging after 1 year - am very disappointed."
3,Good but not great,"This vacuum does a good job while it is fully charged. So if you have a vacuuming job that doesn't take too long, you'll be fine. But a charge only lasts about 15 minutes, and the last 5 minutes of the charge renders the vacuum pretty weak. You'll be recharging often, which is not only a nuisance but frankly inconvenient. Also, the vac has to be emptied of dust and dirt often, because it holds so little. Still, it's a good vac for the small cleanup jobs it's intended for. But care, maintenance and hours of recharging to get 15 minutes use out of it is something you should weigh before purchasing this."
2,shark cordless vac,"i ordered this item, it says tahat comes with 3 small tools to help you clean the smaller areas. i did not get 2 of the tools in the package. I ordered another one, again it was the same thing!!! so i had to return this item.. And i would not recommend this item since the packaging not complete, i doubt how it would be its performance over all."
1,Problems recharging,"Although this vacuum cleaner is good in terms of suction, it is very frustrating because you cannot recharge it."
1,Not a good company,"I paid over $100 for my Shark as advertised on TV. It was ""ok"", it worked well on my floors but would hot pick up cat hair so I called them and asked how I go about returning it. They gave me a return number to put on the outside of the box, which I did. I took it to UPS and it was off. They never took it off my credit card. I called them and they said they never received it. I gave the name of the person who signed for it and they said they would take it off my credit card immediately... I'm still waiting and it's been 6 months.I refused to pay the credit card company for the product and supplied them with the receipt that it was received and after all this time, they are still saying they never got the vacuum back! Even with the name of the person who signed for it!!!! I will never do business with them again.For $30 this is a deal though... but for over $100 I expect it to pick up cat hair."
1,Not the Answer to Underpowered Hand Vacuums,"After many small Black and Deckers that had to be replaced because the battery packs would not take a charge and could not be replaced, I thought it was time to try the competition. Unfortunately, I was unable to evaluate how this model worked as the cheap plastic catch that fastens the air horn to the body was broken out of the box. This was probably my good luck as it undoubtedly would have broken later and rendered the vac useless. I returned the unit and replaced it with a B&D CHV1400 which is a bit larger than I like, but an otherwise impressive unit."
4,cordless vac,"I purchased this vac mainly to vac my car..Its a little large to get in small areas of the car..Ithas great vacume power and good battery life..It excells in small vacume jobs around the house..It has a rotating brush in the vacume head and it works great picking small debris on rugs and furniture..Easy emptying, no bags to replace..D. Strickland, North Carolina"
1,Incorrect Model recieved,"THE ITEM NUMBER SHOWN IS SV736THE ITEM SHIPPED IS ""SV736N"". THIS MODEL HAS NO CHARGING STAND OR BRUSH.PICTURES SHOWS ALL THE ITEMS IN THE PACKAGE.When the Item came, on the box it said 'SV736N' as did the product description. However, if you open the product and look at the model number on the dustbuster itself, you see that it is, in fact, a SV736 - which doesn't come with the mountable charging unit. I called amazon and they said that they would take down this listing and investigate. Hopefully that happens. Caveat emptor. Gave one star b/c it's not the device i ordered.Shark SV736N 15.6-Volt Cordless Handheld Vacuum Cleaner with Motorized Brush, Colors Vary"
2,The Shark Was Great for 3-4 Months,"I loved the shark when I first got it. The motorized brush went first, after about 2 months, and then at month 3 or 4 the suction went soft. It would work at full power for about 1 minute, and then slowly peter out. I probably should have contacted the manufacturer, but I didn't. I got a lemon."
5,One useful tool!,This is a very handy vacuum that seems to perform respectfully. Highly recommended!
2,motorized brush breaks quickly,"otherwise, decent vacuum. small attachment good for narrow spots. without the motorized brush, not so great for carpets though."
2,Dont do it!,"I purchased this a long time ago and I don't usually take the time to write reviews but I finally got around to warning others about this product.I was very excited about purchasing this hand held vacuum cleaner since I have a dog who sheds a ton and rides in the car. I figured I could clean up the mess quickly and easily with this gadget and that worked great for maybe 8 weeks; 3 months tops. This vacuum does not hold a charge! The instructions said the battery life would strengthen after multiple charges. Never happened. It worked pretty well for a few months and now even if I charge it overnight it stays on for about 8 -10 minutes at best. Long enough to do the quick clean up, but 10 minutes after only few months of use? Completely ridiculous! I have to remember to bring it in the house to charge after every single use and even then it doesn't matter because the battery won't function after its been dormant for a day. Good concept-this hand held, but I need one that actually works."
1,Doesn't recharge anymore,"It stopped recharging after 7-8 months of usage, and 1-year warranty didn't cover it because the customer service told me it's the charger's fault and it'll cost me $12 to get a new one. I wasted 30 minutes talking to a guy who barely speak English, and I had to yell half the time for him to understand me."
2,Nice while it lasted...,"I'll agree with other reviewers that this hand vac has impressive suction power. So much so, that I was ready to retire my upright and just use this and the Roomba for my house.... glad I waited!After about 3 or 4 uses over the course of a month, it would no longer recharge. I tried using different outlets, cleaning every nook & cranny, even opening it up to make sure the battery didn't get jarred out of position -- no luck. Unfortunately, the cost of sending it in during its one-year limited warranty (shipping & insurance + $12 for return shipping) was worse than just buying a new battery and hoping it fixes the problem.Ultimately this product costed me about $15 more than its listed price. For that, I would have just gone with a fancier model at Bed, Bath & Beyond. Just a warning from one person's dilemna about buying such a product online. My Shark turned out to be a lemon."
4,It works!,"I bought the Shark for vacuuming out my car. It does what I need it to do. The only thing I would suggest is it needs an attachment for doing detail work. Otherwise, I recommend this product."
4,Great battery powered hand vac!,"I wish the battery lasted longer but it does go for about 15 mins. Very powerful, picks up anything my two young kids can throw at it. We use it daily in the car and in the kitchen. I am going to buy a second one and keep it in the car."
4,good little picker-upper,"Works great, I love the motorized head. Seems well made...only time will tell if it lasts!!"
5,Super powerful handheld vac,"For its size, it's a very mighty little vacuum. I've had others, but this one really seems to pick up, and the power brush is a bonus. I've been careful with the charger and made certain to fully discharge it and then not overcharge the unit after reading some of the reviews on the batteries. So far it's working just great!"
5,Great hand held vac,"We were tired of anemic hand held vacs that we have owned in the past.We searched the internet & consumer reviews before deciding on the Shark vacuum. The motorized brush is awesome cleaning up pet hair,especially from upholstered furniture. With 3 cats,this is an ongoing battle.The vacuum is powerful & holds a charge well before running out of power.The recharge light is helpful but w wish the vac had an indicator showing when charging is complete & also one for low battery.We rely on the sound of the motor to tell us when to recharge,but an indicator such as on our cell phones would be useful.The vacuum arrived very promptly & in good condition.We are considering purchasing another Shark vac to use in the workshop."
1,bait and swich,"THE ITEM NUMBER SHOWN IS SV736THE ITEM SHIPPED IS ""SV736N"". THIS MODEL HAS NO CHARGING STAND OR BRUSH.PICTURES SHOWS ALL THE ITEMS IN THE PACKAGE. IT'S NOT LIKE IT JUST HAPPENED. THIS IS THE MAJOR COMPLANT.AMAZON SHOULD LOOK INTO THIS SELLER!"
4,Works really well,"So far this item is living up to it's billing - powerful, reliable, and easy to use."
4,Pleased,The Shark SV736 cordless vacuum seems to work very well. I've only used it twice but was pleased with the results. I haven't used the motorized brush yet but it worked well in the testing stage. I would recommend this item.
2,Needs $30 battery after 3 yrs,"Nice machine and worked fine BUT, the length of time it could be used on a charge decreased from maybe 10 mins when new to about 1 min or less after barely 3 years. The cost of a replacement battery is about $30, or 75% of its new cost. I do not consider this a good value."
3,It works well but the battery depletes too quickly,"I bought this to vacuum cat litter and dust. It performed well in the beginning. After two months of moderate use, however, the battery started to drain quickly, and it became clear that it was not holding a good charge. Ultimately, I feel that it was a little gimmicky and had little utility for the money spent on it.I did not bother to replace the battery as I decided to travel and move my things to storage."
2,Charge doesn't last,I should have done a little more research before purchasing this handheld vacuum. The charge doesn't last long enough & the vacuum doesn't suck that well for the money
3,No Wall Mount,"Bought this for my weekend house. Works ok, but no better than my Dust Buster at home. I would not buy this unit again because, most importantly, this does NOT include a wall mount (which is also not available from Amazon.) Buy a DustBuster, and get to hang your unit on the wall and out of the way!!"
2,Poor battery life after 6 months,"I thought highly of this vacuum early on due to its power and nice attachments. However, after about 6 months, the battery life started to fall off dramatically. Now I can't vacuum for more than a minute (literally) before the power falls off and it needs to be returned to the charger. The replacement battery is nearly as expensive as the vacuum itself."
1,shark broke after 1 year,"The vacuum was great for about 1 year then it broke. I should have learned my lesson the first time I bought another Shark and it broke after about 1 year. What can I say, I am a slow learner?!"
2,2 minute charge,"Great suction for a handheld, but the charge lasts a very disappointing 2-3 minutes and it's pretty much dead. Charge several hours, get 2 minutes use, better to get a plug in."
1,Worst Vacuum Ever,"Ok, where to begin. First off the picture shows a silver and grey model. But I recevied a bright green/black one. Second, the battery is a nickel battery not a lithium ion battery. I followed all the intstructions for charging (which included always depleting the battery before recharging to maintain max battery charge ability). The most amount of time i ever had it operate was about 7 minutes, only 3 or 4 minutes of which was full suction power. Speaking of full suction power, the suction power of this vacuum is weak. I remember the first time I opened my trunk of my car to clean my trunk and I could barely pickup anything. I remember doing a self pity chuckle and told myself maybe its because its just the first time use and it has to be broken in. Nope, It always stayed like that. Who knows, maybe I got a disfunctional one, but I doubt it. This is one of the only items I have purchased from Amazon that I am not happy with. Shark this model fails."
1,Cheap / Short-Life Batteries,"The hand vac works pretty well for a cordless, but the batteries don't last long, and they die without much warning. Replacement batteries cost about 50% of the cost of the vacuum itself."
4,Great for what it is.,I bought this to use strictly in my room. It cleans my area rugs in a flash and works beautifully. It also cleans my couch and my hardwood floor without much problem at all.I would never use this to clean anything more than that though.The battery runs out really quick so I would have liked it if while plugged in it would use battery through an AC adaptor or something like that. Its my only gripe. For $40 bucks this thing Rocks!
1,BEWARE - YOU MAY RECEIVE ANOTHER MODEL,"I received another model (green 'cyclonic animal') from Amazon twice. Finally they acknowledged the problem is more widespread than originally thought and refunded my money. The green model doesn't come with the same attachments nor the charging/mounting base. I had the same issue with another online seller, so obviously there is an issue with the model numbers being too similar. I can't actually rate the product since I never used it, but wanted to let you know that if you are looking for this silver model that is pictured as of 2/10/08 with attachments and charging stand, you may not get it."
5,Great vac - great value,"Costs a little more than some, but quality is good and it works beautifully. Extremely handy for small rugs and upholstered furniture. Does a good job on fine pet hair/fur, a real challenge for all vacuums."
5,Great little machine,I ordered this product to use on my stairs. I can't believe how well it picks up dirt. It's got really good suction and the different pieces are great for getting the edges and corners. I'm very pleased with the product and recommend it for stairs and for little odd jobs around the house. It really comes in handy.
4,The Shark,I'm disabled and not able to push a regular vacuum around. I love this Shark. It is easy to handle and lightweight. It holds it's charge for days. I hate vacuuming but this makes it worthwhile.
3,"Works fine, poor battery","This is well priced, works fine (quiet powerful), poor battery performance.An attachment with brush shown in the pictures on the product page was not actually in the package. That would have been a useful attachment for Shark to consider."
1,Not worth it,This vacuum never seems to be fully charged. It is very weak & does not last long after being unplugged. I was very disappointed in this product.
3,Shark Handheld,"This product is a great improvement over the older low voltage handheld vacuum it replaces. It is a slight bit heavier but is easy to use and a charge lasts a fairly long time. The operating manual indicates that there is a wall bracket available for the unit; two unanswered e-mails and two phone calls were necessary to find out that the wall mount is no longer made. Too bad, it take up too much room on the shelf and storing the charger is a pain. That fact would have influenced my buying decision."
2,NOT AS GOOD AS THE HYPE,"AFTER A MONTH OF LIMITED HOUSEHOLD USE, THE CHARGER WENT BAD, TRYING TO GET A PERSON WHO SPEAKS THE LANGUAGE OF THIS COUNTRY IS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE.THEY WERE GOING TO CHARGE ME FOR THE 1 MONTH OLD CHARGER, AS THIER WARRANTY DOESNT COVER ANYTHING ELECTRICAL! , SO REMEMBER THAT BEFORE YOU BUY!, IF YOU BUY! I WOULDNT EVER AGAIN!THEY FINALLY SENT ME A NEW CHARGER AFTER SPENDING AN HOUR ON THE PHONE ARGUING WITH BOMBAY!AND THAT TOOK OVER 2 MONTHS!"
2,Not for a boat,"I bought this vac because of the beater bar and its portability and small size. Apparently it is critical to charge the battery EXACTLY as stated in the owner's manual. On a boat that has only occasional 110v power, the battery will not charge fully. When plugged into a home socket, it performs better but still does not hold a charge for long. If the vac came with a regular AC cord instead of only the cordless option, it would be a great vac. Wish I had returned it."
1,plug charger stop working,i was so happy to receive my vac but one week later the charger stop working to charge it and now its i guess garbage. i need help and answers as to why the charger stop working because i only used it once. please tell me you stand behind your product and will replace the defective charger you sent me
2,Ridiculous deal! You have to vacuume twice!!,"I bought this because ""cordless"" sounded good for vaccuming inside my car more often. The machine works fine, and is powerful enough. But after vaccuming, in order to clean the filter inside, I have to use my poweful house canister vaccume cleaner every time. I rather use extention cord to do the job with my canister just once. Ahhhhhhh~!"
3,Look at description carefully!!!,"I did not look too carefully. I knew it was refurbished, but did not know it DID NOT come w/ wall mount which I wanted. I also was unable to get one anywhere, not even from the manufacturer. AFter buying it, the restocking fee plus return shipping didn't make it worth it to return it. I kept it and am trying to sell it in local paper at a slight loss. I bought another refurbished one which DID come with everything... and I read the description more carefully."
1,"Zinc Doubles, Castigate California for Deathrose Promotions","The book's concept is noteworthy but hideously, virulently abused. The stories within are hackneyed and wayward. They lack the ability to demand the attention of the reader. This is a very, very BADLY ORGANIZED VENTURE. Sounds harsh? I am apathetic. Throw a toxic-waste-infested gardenia at my Honda Civic; the impact would be more substantial than anything in the pages of this compilation."
1,As Horrible as the Title,"The title says it all--I mean, you just can't expect works of literary value from a book that has ""Earth Strikes Back"" for it's title, can you?Completely worthless, the book exists just to push some very pro-eco propaganda. While I agree that we do need to take a better care of earth, writing stories about gruesomely murdering people wearing fur or anti-environmentalists turning into puddles of toxic waste isn't a very good way to get the point across. The writing is very, very bad--it's not just a lack of interesting plot or characters,...--it's that bad, trust me. And the subject matter--written in the right way, even the most blatant propraganda can be convincing and even interesting, but this is unbearable. The only reason I bought this book was because it was selling at a meager price =..., but I now regret having spent even that much on it. Don't read this--it's a complete waste of time and money."
1,"Latvian Gambit, the best opening...for your opponent","The Latvian Gambit is a risky, impractacle opening that only prevails over weak players. To do an in depth study of this is useless, and not recommended."
3,"Good card, lousy instructions","So far, I like how this card runs. The fan is audible, but nowhere close to as loud as the small fan that sits on my desk in the summertime. It's a soft whirring in the background. The graphics are good and I have no issues with its performance.This product is rated down because the manufacturer's installation instructions are extremely inadequate and also misleading. I am not terribly familiar with computers, and was relying on the manual to help me install the card. The directions were written so long ago, they do not account for Windows Vista or the existence of PCI-Express, and contain no images or diagrams to assist the novice user. The manual actually says that cards are either PCI or AGP, and PCI cards should be inserted into a White slot and NEVER into a black slot. PCI-E x16 cards, as it turn out, go into black slots.In short, good model nVidia card, but XFX dropped the ball on this one."
3,Low power but with Direct X 10 support,"I would not really recommend this card unless you are on a REALLY tight budget and REALLY need DX10. Even if you get it for DX10, it has so little power that you won't be able to really use games that use DX10. Either save your money for 8800 series or got the 7900 series that don't have DX10 but much more power than this thing."
5,Must Read,"This book was written in 1973 as a result of a vision the Lord gave David Wilkerson. Interestingly, I came to know the Lord and first read the book in 1974. Coincidentally, I re-read it every four years for a period of time - 1978, 1982, and 1986. During those years, I saw many of the prophecies in the book begin to take place. I had a thought to read it again just a month ago (2010) and the first page deals exactly with our present economy.Initially, in 1974, hardly any (if any) of the prophecies had taken place. Re-reading this and watching the events unfold over the years has given me a solid, foundational belief that the rest of the book will happen.I'm so thankful to have this vision as part of a roadmap into our future. The Lord is gracious and ""does nothing that He doesn't tell the prophets."""
1,Failed Prophet,"While it has been thirty years since I read this book, I recall a lot of things Wilkerson said that never came true. If that's standard's good enough for you, then so is this revised book. Many of the things the author predicted were dated as to when they should happen, like within the decade. Three decades later, they remain unfulfilled. Many of the things he said that were not dated look like they may yet be fulfilled, but all of them are the kinds of things that many of us would guess are going to happen anyway -- severe weather changes, economic hard times -- and things that I would have guessed even thirty years ago were going to happen within my lifetime. Why did he miss 9/11 when he predicted what would happen to New York City, and why doesn't he show in the book which of his predictions did come true or explain why so many have not ... if he's going to bother writing an expanded edition?"
1,A re-release under a different name?,"If you are interested in what the music press has to say about MUSE, knock yourself out. This is not a documentary of the band, nor does it contain interviews or insight into their impressive history. If I wanted the opinion of the music press, I would read the NME. A complete waste of time and money."
1,not what i thought.....,Beaware that this is not a dvd concert. The dvd consists of 3 or 4 people talking about the band Muse.
3,not what was expected,"Thought this to be a live concert, more like a documentary. Although still enjoyed it. Maybe have to watch it a couple of times to get the jist of it."
5,Superb!,"If like me you have everything Muse have ever done then you will want to get your hands on this DVD. Would also be good if, like many, you have only got into the band in the last few years as the film goes into quite a lot of detail about the early days and Showbiz era. There was some live footage and interviews with the band that I hadn't seen before which made it particularly worth while. Well worth purchasing."
1,RED ACE SQUADRON,"HAVE A HP 510C COMPUTER'\,256 RAM,1.3 INTEL CELERON 40,O GB HARD DRIVE,AND THIS GAME WOULD NOT LOAD PROPERLY .THEIR TECH DEPT WAS OF NO HELP WHATSOEVER,SAYING I PROBABLY NEEDED UPGRADED DRIVERS,WHICH SOUNDS LIKE CAMEL DUNG UNTO ME.SINCE THE OTHER GAMES I HAVE PURCHASED,HAVE ALWAYS LOADED OKAY.MU ADVICE IS BEWARE OF THIS PRODUCT.THERE IS SOMETHING DRASTICALLY WRONG."
2,LOVE THE PACKAGING!!!,"I usually try to cut ALPHA dvds some slack because they deal with hard to find films and present them to the the consumer with great packaging at a very low cost. However, their version of THE WAY OF THE WEST starring Wally (my favorite) Wales is quite frankly, horrible. I knew I was in trouble when the opening credit photo shots of the cast began with the henchmen, leaving out the main characters! Jumpy, splicy, blurry, fuzzy, dark. VCI has this in their current catalog, complete and uncut with a Buddy Roosevelt second feature which is also in great shape. The VCI dvd is the one to buy here. Both features are clean, sharp, and bargain priced! ALPHA could have/should have come up with a better print, they're out there...By the way, did I mention how I loved the packaging, a great old poster shot of Wally duking it out with William Desmond...if only ALPHA would have searched as hard for a nice clean print of this movie as they did for the great packaging!"
2,Disappointed,"We were tired of having our cats trail white kitty litter all over the house so we thought we'd try the natural type. Unfortunately it trailed much worse, sticking to the long hair on the underbelly of one of our cats and dropping off on his favorite sleeping spots! Also this type of litter doesn't trap the odors as effectively as the chemical stuff. Overall we were disappointed that it didn't suit our needs. Still, if you're looking to go natural and don't mind it not being quite as effective in trapping odors, it functions OK, just don't expect it to work as well as the chemical stuff!"
2,Would have been great...but...,"I have two cats. My female cat did not have any problems with it, however my male cat refused to use it after a few days. We started finding his pee in other areas of the house when the box smelled like cat pee. I didn't notice the smell myself, but he did. As soon as the box was completely emptied and refilled, he would use it again...and again a few days later he would pee where he wasn't supposed to. Other than my one cat not liking it, we would have kept using it. I thought the odor control was pretty good and it didn't track too terribly."
2,Good Idea but Bad Product,I like the idea of using natural litter but the pieces are the size andconsistency of fish food. It was cedar flakes! My cats tracked it everywhere. I had to sweep the floor every day. I found it to be not as absorbent as Feline Pine. The cedar smell was minimal and only there when I got right next to the box. I know that all litters are going to track but at least with Feline Pine I can easily pick up individual pieces without getting out the vaccuum or broom.
1,"works great, but impossible to find replacement bags","I'm still hunting for the correct replacement bags for this thing, which makes it useless. i've had mine for over a year, and it works wonderfully -- doesn't lose suction even when the bag is full. it's also lightweight and looks nice. it's very cheaply made, so i handle it with care, but it does the job."
2,not so happy,"When I unpacked this little sucker,it looked fairly sturdy, as this was one of the reasons for me to get it. What disappointment, when the floor attachment immediately broke off at he elbow that attaches to the pipe.Fortunately I had the attachments of my old europro canister saved and they fit ( to my surprise), which saved me a return shipment and the hazzle.Would I purchase it again? Probably not."
1,"Noisy, smelly when working and plastic parts not durable - look elsewhere",After using excellent Butler Revolution (which used to be sold by Bissell but discontinued - probably was too good compared to other Bissell models) for several years I was stupid enough to buy this product. It was 50% more expensive (on sale with coupon)and at least 5 times worse. DO NOT BUY IT - it's nice looking Chinese-made junk.
2,Don't Bother. Go Bagless,"I'm satisfied with the performance of the product. It works fine for vinyl floors, which is all I have. Unfortunately, I can't find bags. The company has been out of them close to three months and all I get is the run-a-round and empty promises when I call customer service. The bags that I was promised were arriving in the warehouse three weeks ago and would be shipped to me IMMEDIATELY, still have not arrived at my home. I have an almost brand-new product that is useless. I will not be buying any Euro-Pro product simply because their lack of customer service."
3,Stick to solid surfaces,"I purchased this Vac with the hopes of having something lighter than my Kirby for my three stories. I am dissapointed with its serious lack of cleaning power on rugs. Hard surfaces it does well. If you have all solid floors, go for it...rugs....don't bother."
4,Great vacuum for the price,"The only reason I didn't give this vacuum 5 stars is because it doesn't have a beater bar. Other than that, it's fantastic! I have a shedding cat, a balding husband, a 2 year old that gets into, well, EVERYTHING, and a 2 month old who needs the floor clean for his rolling around, (He doesn't always stay on his play mat) and this vacuum really sucks! (In a good way!!!) I'm shocked at how long it takes to fill up the bags with as small as they are, and have had no problems finding/buying replacement bags. (Usually found at Target and Bed Bath and Beyond.)"
3,chip alternative,"Looking for a better snack than chips, so thought I'd give these a try. They are healthier, but not exactly the taste I was hoping. The texture is great, it's just the seasoning that doesn't appeal to me. My husband hasn't eaten many of them either and he's a big chip snacker. I gave some to my son in college hoping to get rid of them. Will not be buying again. But, everyone has different tastes, so the only way to know is to try."
4,Finally One that Works!!!!,"I grew tired of the yellow stains on all my white t-shirts from regular anti-perspirants so I threw them all out bought all new ones.First thing I did was do a good system cleanse to detoxify my body. Then I started using all natural salt deodorants like Lafes, Kiss My Face, and the Thai Crystal Spray. Thai Crystal worked the best out of bunch but it didn't give me the long term odor and sweat protection that I was used to with the conventional brands..I experimented with taking Chlorofresh with while using DR Mist Unscented..and I am absolutely blown away at the results..After the first 3 days of taking both, I have very minimal odor and no noticeable perspiration after a long active day (12 hours).Very pleased with the results so far..4/5 stars for the tiny bottle (they should offer a larger size) and for the horrible price on Amazon..It is more than half the price at other places.."
5,WoW,"Where do I begin? Every deodorant I tried didnt work. They would cut off in the middle of the day, or sometimes sooner. They definatley didnt last the night thru...because in the morning, I would smell a musty odor in my sheets ...where my armpits had been. I have spent a small fortune trying to find a deodorant that would work. I even tried the rock crystals - which worked for a few months and then stopped working all together. I was very skeptical to try this stuff. But nothing else worked...so I thought I would give it a shot. When I got the product and saw how watery it was ...I was even more skeptical thinking...how on earth will this work???? I tried it. Noticed it worked immediately...and it lasted all day. The musty smell in my sheets was gone. This stuff is the real deal folks."
3,Not so wonderful,I used this product after reading the reviews. It does sting quite a bit when applied. Then it itched a bit as well. I don't think it works as well on me as I was hoping it would. I tried 2.99 BAN and had better effects. Would not recommend. Would not buy again. Not the miracle spray I was looking for!
1,Didn't work for me,"I tried this and noticed it minimally lowered the amount of sweat and odor but nothing special, my shirt smelled like BO after a day of using this as a deodorant. Don't know if I just sweat an abnormal amount but would not recommend this product."
5,Works perfectly with LaserJet 3550,"This transfer kit works with the HP Color LaserJet 3550, despite Amazon's printer supply finder's opinion to the contrary. Installed in a moment and worked perfectly the first, second third... times. I got ~35,000 pages off the last one, hope this one lasts as long or longer. Perfect!"
1,Terrible.,"I stuck with this book for 120 pages. By then our heroine had lost her brothers (gettysburg), her father (mauraders), her mother and her fiance (buried alive), been gang raped, and was hit several times by men, even her 'love interest'. This book smacks not only of violence (which civil war or any war books have to some degree) but particular violence against women. And the writer doesn't understand the womans view. After being gang raped , she falls into bed without qualms with someone else a few days later. It is so disturbing that I found myself searching for info on the author. 'Felicia Andrews' may be a man since the copywright info is in the name of charles grant. That made me feel better because at least a woman did not write so callously about another woman. Scratched this writer, whether it is a man or woman, off my buy list."
1,Not My Cup of Tea,"I'd not realized that this was from the same director as ""No Skin Off My Ass"" (which a gay friend and I rented some years ago and didn't care for). The director has a strong fixation with neo-Nazi Skin Heads, their violence, psychological make up, and homoerotic tendencies. I mistakenly thought this was a regular drama; instead, though ""dramatic"" and violent, it's also (bad) soft core porn--or rather hard core with all the naughty bits (mostly) off screen. I recommend this film to any having a strong fixation on British neo-Nazi Skin Heads. I advise other folks to skip this film altogether. The violence is brutal (though I've seen worse) and the sex scenes, of which there are plenty, were all un-sexy (at least to me.) All in all, not my cup of tea."
2,TOO STRANGE AND PRETENTIOUS,"UNLIKE HUSTLER WHITE, WHICH WAS STRANGE BUT CAMPYSKIN FLICK IS JUST PLANE WEIRD, POINTLESS, AND TRIES TO PASS OFF AS INTELLECTUAL, REVOLUTIONARY, AND INNOVATIVE....WHICH IS NOTNO BIG LOSS IF YOU MISS THIS MOVIE."
1,Still amateurish after all this time...,"This isn't LaBruce's first film by any means, but he certainly hasn't learned anything along the way. A potentially interesting concept is ruined by laugh-aloud acting, purile dialogue, and absolutely no sense of pacing or development. The scenes of brutality are jaw-droppingly amateurish. These punks are supposed to be threatening? Good grief, I can get more rage out of my high school theater students. How this man manages to keep finding backers is the most intriguing thing about the 71-minute ""film."""
3,Be prepared,"I honestly had no idea what I was getting when I got this movie, reccomended to me from someone else, I went on that and bought it, I was absolutely shocked when I started watching it.Very graphic sexually, and the slurs are a little hard to hear constantly but some of the scenes are pretty darn hot and the music in it is actually pretty good..If your into the more obscure cultish flicks, and like Bruce La Bruce and Steve Masters, then you'll probably think this movie is ok.thats all I can really say about this flick..Worth owning? No...Worth watching at least once? yes..."
3,hmm,"I rented this film, thinking it was a bad-ass kind of gang film.Therefore, I was extremely surprised when all the gay sex started kickin' in.The sex scenes were awfully realistic and long; I would classify this film as a violent porn film.For a straight person like me, it was an eye-opener--really intense stuff.I felt like I took a peep into the world of gay sex.The film was good, as an experience."
4,Artistic Movie,"This movie was very interesting. I thought the story line was okay, some of the scenes were very hot, but the director really guards against showing the completion of the sexual act, i.e. the money shots. Other than that, it was an interesting movie. I wish you could have a moment to actually focus on the sex but there are so many cut aways from the sex scenes and then cuts back to the sex scenes that it can be a little disorienting sometimes. Maybe that's what was intended. I hope this director, although he wants to be known simply as an artist, realizes that profit for his work is also important and he will begin to incorporate extended scenes that actually show the beauty of the bodies colliding and allows the artistic viewer to actually see the completion, in its entirety, of the act between the actors."
5,To your health,I love the Wellness Tea's from Celestial Seasonings. It helps me get through the winter months with out getting sick.As soon as I feel a little down I drink a cup of Echinacea complete and it helps right away.Thanks for such a great product.Teresa Kendall
1,Less is not more,"Just bought the ""old"" version of Sleepytime tea - smaller, less in the tea bags, less fragrant combination - I was a forty year fan, no longer, not for the price of the former product. Sooooo disappointed.They must have sold out. No excuse for ruining a great product."
4,Great movie,Loved the movie. Would recommend it to anyone. Starts out slow but then gets very interesting.
2,Not as thorough as they make you believe...,"This dictionary is definitely for the layman's theologian. For those of a somewhat firm grasp of theological terminologies, you're better off sticking with a standard merriam-webster collegiate abridgement, or a larger, deeper theological dictionary. This dictionary is probably for the novice, or beginning student of theology or philosophy. There are many terms NOT included in this dictionary that I find often in theological studies that you'd think would be included. Where's the entry for ""semiotics""? Where's the entry for ""cosmogony""? Or how about ""bibliomancy""? This book is very small, so at least they don't mislead you about its size. There are other theological dictionaries which have better application for the theology student/scholar in mind.I suggest picking up Westminster's Dictionary of Theological Terminology by McKim for a more complete dictionary."
3,Better in hard copy,"The content is good, but I found that Kindle 2 is clunky to navigate through a dictionary type book. I would rather have this one in hard copy for easy reference or on my iphone."
1,Kindle edition practically useless,"I own both the paperback and the Kindle edition. Since the Kindle edition lacks a table of contents or index, it's basically useless. You can search for a word but will only find an exact match of that word everywhere that it appears in the dictionary. Would recommend getting the paperback until they improve on the Kindle format."
1,Don't bother.,"I tried to like this book, I really did. Somehow I did make it through the whole thing but it feels like a waste of time. The story meanders, and nothing much is of interest, until the grandmother shows up and then she's gone before you know it. And also when the twins leave and have their misfortunes, but it is incredulous that they weren't worse. Anyway, as I said above, don't bother."
3,Disappointing,"I usually enjoy Barbara Metzger's books and would rate them at 4 or 5 stars. They're witty with great characters. I know romances aren't realistic, but this plot seems just a little too silly. It's still a fun read and many times better than most of the authors writing in romance today."
5,Watermelon,"Watermelon flavored Lip Smackers is awesome. The smell actually resembles real, fresh watermelon. And while I don't usually like watermelon-flavored things (I usually like only real, fresh watermelon), Lip Smackers is one watermelon-flavored thing I do love. The smell is that of fresh watermelon, which I can only get in the summer. It reminds me of when I was a child and we actually grew watermelons. Now I have to get them from the market.I love Lip Smackers for their moisturizing and healing properties. The wonderful scents are an added bonus."
1,Not drinkable,Don't even compare it to F & M. It is muck for any serious 'tea drinker' I was disappointed and will not but it again
5,First rate product and service,"Service was extremely fast and efficient, and the tea was exactly what I was looking for. I first had a taste of this in a teahouse in Boulder, and this is exactly what I remembered. Also, this is literally half the price than ordering it from the other location."
2,Musty stink of sameness even in it's brevity,"2 1/2 starsThere are a few good songs on here- when the duo remain focused and articulated in their hellbilly vibe the sweetly distorted riffs actually compliment the vulgar, drugged out lyrics. Oftentimes though the songs feel gimmicky and cheap when the Moistboyz formula is all too apparent, as opposed to the really good songs on the album, which demonstrates Ween's extraordinary abilities to borrow from different genres. I like the cynical ode to rock they are riding, I just wish they could own up to the concept a little more rather then rock on constant autopilot."
5,Good handles,Handles are built well and work good for the application I bought them for. We used them for tube doors on a Jeep Wrangler.
5,Heavy Duty Paddle Latch,"Quick shipping, solid built. They were better than expected even came keyed! Made an old pair of doors look new replacing out the rusted sticking paddles! Whisper quiet and easy to shut and open no more slamming needed."
1,Uninspiring and Powerless,It's a nice looking product with a red light that turns on when plugged in. Not sure what the red light indicates - it doesn't provide any charge to the my ZEN Vision.
5,It Works!,"I tend to be hesitant about anything that costs a lot less than a comparable item. Luckily, I let the cheapskate in me decide this time. I was pleasantly surprised. It is nothing fancy, but it does what it is supposed to and it does it well. I am rough with anything in the car, and it never came out of the outlet. The coil is a bit tight, but you get used to it. I can't have fragile items, so I can't imagine anyone breaking this. I would recommend this to anyone."
3,My charger was great til it broke,"I loved the price and the product did a fine job charging, but only lasted about 2 months and then broke. :(I need another car charger, but dont know wether to buy another one of these or not."
4,A good gay movie!,"It's a very low-budget movie, but has a great heart and is enjoyable to watch. The incomparable Ileana Douglas is a treat and it's a shame Craig Chester was never allowed more roles. Madonna ""Truth or Dare"" dancer Carlton Wilborn and Alexis Arquette provide enough flesh to make the movie worthwhile on separate merits."
3,disappointment,"the sound quality just sounds hideously wrong, and the music seems to be re-treading old ground. i'm a big fan of godspeed's work, but even i can't pretend to like this one. i only gave it 3 stars cause im in denial. check out lift yr skinny fists or slow riot instead, and if youre an old godspeed fan, although this probably wont stop you anyway, at least hear it before you spend your cash."
5,Their best work to date (not a dissapointment),i listened to this by myself in the dark with headphones on and had a really enjoyable experience. five stars because no matter what anyone else says i still think this album is epic.
2,The Sad Truth,"To all you folks out there thinking of buying this album - Think again. I'm a huge fan of all GY!BE albums besides this one. Those are your best bet. ""Yanqui U.X.O."" on the other hand, is a pile of boredom. The production is muddy and one-dimensional. The field recordings which boosted the magnificence and relevance of their earlier works is completely absent, the song structures are horribly predictable to anyone familiar with GY!BE and post-rock in general. But most of all, the music just isn't that great. Right in the middle of the album i got excited, because i thought it was about to get good. I was soon disappointed, and almost couldn't get through the whole thing.Do yourself a huge favor and pick up ""& Yet & Yet"" or ""Winter Hymn, Country Hymn, Secret Hymn"" -- both vastly superior works by GY!BE's labelmates Do Make Say Think."
2,Defining Dull,"The music on this album is intensely repetitive and boring. I tried mopping my floor while listening to the album, thinking it might be useful at least for that. But no, it is too boring even as background music for domestic chores. The CD clocks in at 75 minutes.... what it contains is so paper thin it might be compressed into five or 10 minutes tops. Do yourself a favor and skip it."
5,Amazing band,"I just recently came to know this band, and I cannot stop listening their records. I bought at the same time 3 of their 4 studio records, all in vinyl. Amazing."
5,excellent record,"This is an awesome record, that is highly original and will leave you feeling docile and alive. Do yourself a favor and buy it."
5,A++++++++++++++++++++++,BEAUTIFUL HAUNTING SONGS!!!!!!!!!!!!!! THEY CREEP UP TO A PEAK THEN CLIMAX AND PEAK THEN BACK TO THE GROUND !!!!!!!!!!!!!! WHAT A RUSH
3,Didn't quite make it,"Despite the fact that GYBE! dispensed with the field recordings and awkward monologues, the music seems to have fallen into a lull. The problem, basically, is that there is too much emphasis on the guitars and basses and the strings and percussion were overshadowed. The latter elements were key in GYBE!'s last two releases, since they helped build up the music into a dramatic and awesome musical climax. That doesn't happen in this album, it just seems to stagger in repetition and undefined, yet superb, musical ideas."
3,mogwai meets mike oldfield?,"This is my first exposure to GSYBE but I was surprised to hear a very late seventies mike oldfield, anthem rock kind of sound. Everything keeps building up to an epic perhaps even baroque crescendo.Maybe this is not such a bad thing but i was hoping for a more introspective meditative thing like mogwai or late swans. Some of the quieter passages achieve this but are offset by the louder parts.That said there are some good hooks here and there. track 4 comes to mind as I am listening to it now."
2,Sad,"There are hints at what might have been a great Godspeed record here, but only hints. Gone is the drama. Gone the surprise. Gone the ""never going to get played on the radio, anyway"" engineering. Gone the collage aspect of previous releases that made me feel like I was listening to something new."
2,Not up to other albums' quality,"I love F# A# and Skinny Fists but this album doesn't live up. The production is bad. Very one-dimensional and muddy. Not at all like the other albums. No soundstage. No strings and bells in front of you. Just a muddy mess. A lot of symbol crashing in the far background like static. I admit I've only given it one listen, but that's all it took to love the others so I think I'm on the right track. Save your money and pass on this one."
5,classic.,"No, for real. This album illustrates all the qualities: minimalism, straight-forwardness, and a good mix. For the first time, godspeed you! black emperor embrace the perks of their fame calling upon ""punk specialist"" steve albini to record them. The latest set of songs we're recorded in just 4 days in chicago last fall - a few weeks after 9/11. then mixed this past summer in montreal by the band. The end result is breathtaking. All songs are completely naked - not even bad notes are mixed out of the final mixes. all songs are also free of samples. the band is world-reknown for their attention to ambience/precision/emotion as opposed to musicianship. they are to music what dogme 95 is to film. this album rocks."
5,albini did good for godspeed,"this record can destroy you. if this had a wide distribution, and everyone who listened truly understood the full scope of this album, its politics, etc- it could incite a revolution. I also want to say Steve Albini did a great job with getting every detail on tape in the best way possible. thanx."
3,Just not as strong...,"I hate to admit it, but shouldn't these people be getting better as time passes? The first three albums, in my opinion, were great, but this one is... almost annoying. There is almost no beautiful harmonies detected in this album that blanketed Godspeed's earlier releases. If you have money to spend... Buy ""Slow Riot..."" ""Lift Your skinny fists..."" or ""F#A#oo"""
2,save your money,I purchased for my son for our trip to disney. he loved it but after a few months it stopped working the cds would no longer play so we replaced it and the new one stopped working as well. I would not recommend this product to anyone it is over priced and you are just paying for the disney name. if you do purchase make sure you get a warranty because you will be bringing it back.
1,faulty product,"We could not get the cd player to work. My husband works in electronics and could not get it to work. I have misplaced my shipping statement for returning the product. Any assistance would be greatly appreciated.How do I return and get a credit without the statement?thanks for your help,Nancy Denman"
5,"More, please","Having read Woman On The Bus, with its quirky view of Irish life, I was moved to read more of this very talented and intelligent writer. Right On Time is number three of the Leo Street trilogy, and I had not read one or two! However, nothing was lost. The characters were as old friends as soon as they were encountered and, after the safety of village life in the Woman on the Bus, we were transported to the darkest and most sinister side of Dublin. The book was funny, poignant with an amazing ending which had me literally shaking with sobs.Pauline McLynn is known as Mrs Doyle from Father Ted, but her ability to tell a story cleverly and with the wit and charm she naturally possesses, is something that must be shared with the world. Read this book. Once you do, you'll be writing to her nagging her to give us more."
1,Did not realize this was a simplified book,"I loved the original version of Jane Eyre. I did not realize this was the simplified/childish version. I did not read it, but I love the story of Jane Eyre, so it might be good abridged, but I doubt it."
2,Don't buy the abridged version!,"Shame on me for trying to save a few dollars...somehow I failed to notice this was the ""abridged"" version.I love Jane Eyre and was looking for a book to add to my collection.So I give 2 stars not for the quality of the book or author, or any other reason...but for the abridged bastardized version of it."
3,Enough to keep Charmed fans satisfied,"I got into Charmed quite unexpectedly, having shown no previous interest in it before. Of course, I got into it AFTER it had finished, so have been busy collecting the TV shows (just have to see season 8 now) and now I've started on the books. (That could take a while though.)Crimson Spell focuses on all the Charmed ones, being infiltrated by a coven of warlocks. Of course who are out to kill them. It stays true to the thread of Charmed, and the characters, so it's easy enough to slip in and read the book, without needing to read them any order - helps if you've seen all the TV show though.Having been the first one I read, I was quite surprised how easily the time passed, and it certainly made me want to start watching Charmed all over again. Probably best not to even be tempted by that idea.The Charmed books are wonderful for fans, and quite possibly also a way for a non-fan to get into the show. They're easy, simple and forgettable. As all novelisations are."
4,the crimson spell,"this is a good charmed book, i like it mainly because piper has a bigger part in this book but all three sisters do have mini stories in this book. although this isnt the best charmed book it is up there with the best"
2,"Wooden, and not worth the time.",The writers who attempt to bring the magic of Charmed to the printed page are leaden and loaded with exposition that is completely unnecessary. I don't know why they bother. These books are abyssmal.
4,Delightful Story,"This is a wonderful, young adult tale consistant with the TV-series created by Constance Burge. Three sisters, Prue, Piper, and Phoebe, become aware that a trusted friend is actually a warlock in disguised, plotting to steal the powers of the Charmed ones. But who is it? Enjoy!"
5,Friends Aren't Always True!,"The girls start off in a quiet period with nothing evil hunting them down. Or so they thought. Now a coven of warlocks is hunting them with one warlock disguised as a friend. Prue meets someone in a Wiccan shop, Piper meets a young girl in a halfway house, where she signed up to be a big sister, and Phoebe meets a young man who does karate with her. Their biggest challenge is to find out who's a threat and who's really their friend."
4,This is a very good vacuum with excellent power and suction.,"The hoover is an excellent vacuum...The unit is inexpensive,has great suction and power...The hoover uses replaceable dust bags,which can be a plus for people with allergies but the replaceable bags add to the units cost,overtime...The unit has been highly rated by a major consumer magazine,and is a best buy...I highly recommend the hoover U5145-900...4.5 stars...The power cord could be longer...If it had been,i would have rated this 5 stars...I thank you Stewart L."
4,Fantastic Vacuum!,"I was a little bit nervous about ordering a vacuum online, especially since the price was so cheap. But I have always been pleased with Hoover products and I wasn't disappointed this time either. This vacuum is fantastic! The suction power is amazing and I was pleasantly surprised that the noise level is more quiet than other vacuums I've used. In other reviews it was mentioned that the attachment hose is not long enough and I do agree with that but I like that it comes with two extensions rather than one as with most other vacuums."
4,good item for the price,"We live in a 2 bed-room condo.We have been using this vacuum for about a month and have been happy with our purchase till now. Cord is pretty long and has lot of tools to clean under the sofa, in corners of the house. Weight is OK, neither too heavy neither light."
5,Love having a bagged vacuum again,I had bought a bagless vacuum and was thoroughly disappointed in it. I bought the Hoover Tempo and am very happy with it. Easy to operate and it does a great job. I would recommend it highly.
3,Sucks great! Belts keep breaking,"I really liked this vacuum the first time I used it. It is very powerful and does a good job cleaning. The cord is a little too short and the attachment hose is a little too short but I can get past that since its really lightweight and easy to carry up the steps. I can carry my son in one arm and the vacuum in the other.The only drawbacks I've come across so far are the access panel to the bag comes off too easy. My son has pulled it off 2x and ripped the bag out. I know they list ""easy access"" as a selling point but if you have a toddler a little less easy access might be better.Also, I've only had it a few weeks and the belt has broken twice. I doesn't do too well if it comes across a rogue sock. ]You can buy comparable bags/belts from Sears that are cheaper than the ones online. Even at [...] you can get your shipping cost back as a refund."
5,"Great, explanatory book for timbales","A very good book for the student of drumming, particularly timbales. The book is written with a music-reading student in mind, so if you can't read music, this won't help you.However, if you can read music, this will be an invaluable tool to learn the rhythms that comprise much of Latin music (Cascara, Danzon, Mambo, Cha Cha Cha, Mozambique, Pilon, Timba Songo Laye, Conga, 6/8 rhythms). Plus you can learn terms like ""abanico"" and other terminology of Timbale playing.Next time you groove with a Latin band, and someone yells ""play a mambo, or go back down to Cascara"", you'll be prepared to know what to do.Great tool! Thanks Changuito and Chuck Silvermann"
1,shame on Wallflower Publishers and the author,"In 25 years of professional scholarship, this book (2nd edition) has the worst copy editing. In chapter 1, three full paragraphs of the text are repeated, and on page 11 the chapter abruptly ends in mid sentence and certainly not at the end of the author's thoughts. These errors are not a matter of the manufacturing of books --since the errors are in mid page----but sloppy copy editing. SHAME."
5,"Cheap, but good.","The purchase price of this replacement power supply was so cheap that it made me nervous. So, I bought two just in case one didn't work. Both work great. It was an excellent bargain and they arrived very quickly. I was more than pleased with the purchase."
2,Not What I Was Expecting--At All,"Wow! This is a bad surprise. I have seen Omar in concert twice and consider myself a huge fan. The first concert I saw with Omar and John Santos was pure magic. This CD is NOTHING like what I heard in concert. The first song is hip-hop jazz. Cool, but not what I was expecting from Omar Sosa at all. My advice; listen carefully to the music samples and see what you think. You may like it. As for myself, I wish I had listened a lot more carefully before I bought. I thought I knew all about Omar Sosa and knew what I was buying. WRONG. Some of the tracks are good. Some I just hate. That's life in the food chain..."
1,Very brief overview,"Mr. Butler gives a very brief overview of what the first SS division went through between 1933-45. Basically he mentions where the division was located and the battles that the division fought. If your looking for a picture book, this is it, but for any detailed history of what this division actually accomplished and why that was of any importance look elsewhere."
5,chocolate chili pepper love,"Becky Freeman has done it again! Not only is she an inspiration to women but to men also! I highly recommend this book for both women and men! My husband loved it! Becky Freeman is ""real"" which comes across in her books. You won't want to miss this one!"
3,My least favorite Coil.....,but lesser Coil is still worth owning. My advice is buy this toward the end of your collecting.
1,Hope they proof read the 7th edition!,"If this book wasn't so full of valuable information, I wouldn't have given it a single star. The proof reader slept through this edition. There are more errors than I could have ever imagined. They sometimes refer to the same variable by different names in succeeding paragraphs! Many times they leave off critical subscript identifiers or don't label important values in the example figures. Small errors crop up all the way through this edition. Hope they fix the Seventh!"
1,Important material bad organization - presentation,"The material this book presents is very important for an engineer. The presentation of the material is very bad. It is very difficult for a student to follow. The mathematical equations are written in unaccaptable form. They are not even properly displayed. Proofs of equations and deriviation of equations do not follow an organized manner. This book is good for peaople that have prior knowledge of the material, and not for students."
4,"Best book, best edition","If you can find a copy of this edition, put it in your library and keep it. Very well written. The principles are well explained, and the sample problems are both helpful and thorough."
1,Unsuitable for undergraduates,"The original Mechanical Engineering Design book written by Joseph Shigley, and later, with Larry Mitchell, was an excellent undergraduate text; it was readable at the introductory level, and it contained enough information and methodology for use as a good reference book after graduation. Unfortunately, this revised text, which was rewritten by Charles Mischke, is thoroughly unreadable, obfuscating, and is totally unsuitable as a text for undergraduate mechanical engineering students. The book is full of nuances, subtleties and informative data that do make it useful as a reference book on the shelf of an experienced design engineer, but not as a text for students learning the subject. For those who plan to teach a course for mechanical engineering majors on this topic, I recommend other texts such a Jack Collins' Mechanical Design of Machine Elements and Machines, Wiley, 2003."
3,Good but hardly comprehensive.,"This book is good at first glance, being accessible and reasonably well indexed. The problem is that it lacks the thoroughness required of a good reference. There is only limited information on the most basic methods and means. It lacks simple things like how to design pinions which mesh with multiple gears, or gears that run under a variety of conditions in normal operations. This fault runs throughout the book, making it almost useless for the slightly obscure applications seen in anything innovative."
3,"Well, it's helpful if you've seen the information elsewhere","I had the 6th edition of this book as the primary text book in my ME design class. It certainly has a wealth of data and formulae for design, but I found its explainations and examples very vague -- particularly if you're coming to it for the first time, or even the second or third time. In fact I frequently found myself confused by information I already knew well before reading this text. If you just need a formula, this is certainly a great reference. If you really need to know how that formula is applied or how to approach the problem, I'd look elsewhere. I also agree with a previous writer: the fatigue section is particularly lacking."
5,"My litte one loves it, that is all I need to know.","I bought this for my four year old. I was thinking she would get it and break it or lose interest in a matter of days. But, to my surprise she loves it. She has not broken it or lost interest. She have dropped it several times and this thing is durable. The bright colors, the big buttons and the flashing graphics just puts a smile on her face.So, as far as I am concerned her happiness is all that matters to me. I highly recommend this cd player.Young at heart mom."
3,Somewhat disappointed,"I got this for my daughter for her 4th birthday and she loved it. But within a year, we have had trouble with the cd player not playing and strange error messages. The buttons are cute, but trying to figure out what they mean without always going back to the instructions is annoying. It's alright, but could be more user friendly and durable."
3,Very under powered,"Very under powered keep plenty of batteries available only takes Two AA and eats them very quickly. Head phones broke in a about ten weeks. Also volume control on headphones had to be taped because volume way to high for a kids. Cute, yes worth the money no Disney could have done better."
3,A Word of Caution,"This headband and wig was not quite as pictured. The color of the wig was a lighter red (much like the headband-wig pictured for the ""Kansas City Chiefs"") and the wig was a lot more wavier. Also...the hair falls out very easily, so you might want to avoid touching/adjusting it too often.I paid for expedited shipping (to California) and the order came in 7 business days. This was reasonable despite it came 2 days short of when I needed it.In addition, don't count on them to reply to emails. They never replied to any of the 5 emails I sent them. I ended up calling them.HOWEVER, not all is bad. The headband kept my ears very warm while the wig attracted a lot of attention. I knocked off two stars for the flaws mentioned above."
5,American Experience: The Amish,I love reading about the Amish way of life and this DVD is an excellent history lesson about the Amish . I learned things I didn't know and it is one you will want to share with others. It was very informative. I highly recommend it if you are interested in learning about the Amish.
5,A REWARDING EXPERIENCE,"Over 100 thought provoking black and white photos of children at the Pattaya Orphanage in Thailand together with complimentary inspirational sayings. You will be enchanted and moved by the children and challenged by the sayings. The proceeds from the book help support the orphanage. Unfortunately, even though this book is going into its fourth or fifth printing, it may not be readily available outside of Thailand. It would also make an excellent gift for almost anyone."
5,Excellent,"Excellent textbook to understand the Greek from a grammatical viewpoint, with helpful commentary on possible translations where needed. It works well for both new students and more experienced scholars."
5,Love this!,"I love the meat grinder attachment to my mixer - also love the mixer and the pasta attachment too. The meat grinder does a great job - is easy to use and not that difficult to clean up. Makes great burgers and sausage too. Much better than buying it already ground in the store. Only thing is that I don't find it cheaper so far, but then that makes me wonder what they're using in the store for the ground meat that is so cheap!"
2,Poor choice of design materials,"In general, I like the Cuisinart stand mixer because it has a more powerful motor and larger capacity than most of its competitors. However, the attachments are poorly designed, particularly the meat grinder. While the grinder is functional, I find the choice of aluminum for the housing poor becuase it cannot be cleaned in the dishwasher. Washing this the grinder housing by hand makes it difficult to sanitize this tool properly. It also suffers from the same design problem that most stand mixer attachments suffer and that is that any small amount of fat clogs the grinder and slows down its efficiency."
2,A special kind of ignorance (negative comments by Cuisinart fans),"It takes a special kind of ignorance to design a meat grinder than cannot be sanitized in the dishwasher and then claim it is especially attractive to ""health-conscious consumers"". People who subscribe to the germ theory of disease will want to sanitize it in the dishwasher. It grinds well enough, hence the two stars."
2,Over priced compared to Kitchenaid,"I gave it a 2 star because of price. Kitchenaid is about $50 less and is the same type of device. I have had a Kitchenaid for a number of years and was pleased with the meat grinder, unfortunately it won't work on my Cusinart Mixer."
5,A great meat grinder for home use,"This grinder makes great hamburger. We tried it the first day, making hamburger out of some stew beef and some chunks of left over raw filet mignon. The grinder easily reduced the meat to hamburger consistency. The clean up was not difficult, and the hamburger produced was better than anything I've had out, ever! The grinder and attachments are sturdy and well made, and seem to me to be designed to last a long time. I recommend this if you need one of these.Update: Been using this for over two years now. If anything, I am more pleased than ever. I never buy store ground hamburger (especially with the ""pink slime"" issue of early 2012), but rather just buy good quality bottom round roast, trim it as needed and grind it. The hamburger is outstanding, not full of fluids like some store bought, and is really fresh. You are also assured, if you take simple precautions, that there is minimal to no bacterial contamination."
5,A fun and informative hands-on astronomy book for kids.,"The Night Sky is an excellent introduction to astronomy for children. I am a science teacher and have looked at many books preparing for my astronomy unit next year - and The Night Sky will be required reading for my class! Information is interesting and exciting. Stargazing is an essential part of the book, but done in the typical ""One Small Square"" fashion so as to interest and excite children with their new knowledge rather than overwhelm them. I loved this book! A must-have for any young scientist!"
5,My tyke loved it.,"I guess I'd put this in the ""educational"" video category, but it has entertainment value, too. It's certainly more entertaining than the Baby Einstein videos. Even in the midst of his LEGOs, he paid attention from start to finish. He even repeated some of the Japanese phrases/words along with the characters. He especially enjoyed the songs and dances in Roly Poly Rice Ball and enlisted me to play along with it.I recommend it if you've got a little one who needs a little more than colors and shapes but isn't quite ready to watch a lion get thrown off a cliff by his evil brother.JR"
4,An interesting and excellent precursor to Wings of Joy,"This early cd previews the Cranes that I love-- that is, the Cranes of Wings of Joy and Self Non Self. I highly recommend it, therefore, to anyone who likes Wings of Joy and are willing to hear the Cranes at an earlier, less refined stage, but for those who are primarily familiar with Forever or Loved, the early Cranes seem to me like an entirely different band from the Cranes in these newer albums. (Incidentally, I don't care for Forever or Loved at all, though I haven't heard any of the newer music.) So, be warned. Self Non Self is a great album, but it's a cranky, moody, and eerie style and not something I would expect many other people to like. If you are unfamiliar with the Cranes, start with Wings of Joy."
4,Great Value,"If you want a DX10 card with a low budget, this is your card. I got some problems with my motherboard bios, but the guys in XFX customer service were great. C&C; 3, NFS Carbon and GRAW looks amazing.P.S. GRAW comes free with the card!!"
4,"Buen producto, exelente en HACKINTOCH",Compre esta tarjeta hace algunos dias y estoy contento con la compra. Funciona muy bien EXELENTE FUNCIONAMIENTO EN MI HACKINTOSH.Gracias
4,Amazing Old School,"This CD is an amazing compilation. The tracks by CJ Bolland, Phuture Assassins, Baby D, EQ, and of course the Prodg. The entire CD gives off the old school vibe, even though not all the tracks sound like the hardcore of 91-93. The music can really groove you, the bassline in Baby D's track is extremely infectious and Golden Girls by Kinetic has a very uplifting riff in it. This CD is definitely worth your money."
2,Get some power!,"Not the best I have heard but not the worst either. The only good song on the CD is by the only good Artists on the CD, Prodigy. If you like Prodigy then the one song for the price is worth it other wise spend your money on some food."
1,Don't bother buying tis.,"I was anxious to use this for my mother as she has a bad back. However, immediately after opening the product, I tried to plug it in, as it doesn't work without batteries being fully charged. Unfortunately, this massager would plug in but did not start charging, and therefore, it could not be charged.I will be returning this item."
5,Groundbreaking ethnographies,"This is by far the most enjoyable and fascinating comparative case-studies I've read concerning treatment of the dead in Southeast Asia. I suggest this book to anyone wishing to crossculturally examine views of the deceased and the rituals associated with death. Superb, absolutely brilliant.Raven Digitalis"
5,modern without being avant garde,"Ms. Grushin writes in a modern but not postmodern style, excellently weaving dream sequences into her narrative that serve as flashbacks and focal points in the life of the Soviet artist and critic Sukhanov. The novel is fascinating in its detail of the artistic life in the USSR from Kruschev's frosty enforced proletarian view of art in the 50s and 60s to the thaw in the 80s just prior to the breakup of the Soviet Union with the emergence of rock music and experimental art such as Chagall's. These transformations are all mirrored in Sukanov's life as he moves from promising artist to party line critic and back, perhaps, to artist. The book is unputdownable, brava!"
5,Sukhanov's search of lost time.,"""The dream life of Sukhanov"" is spell-binding in many ways, in particular in how it empowers the reader to escape the conventional linearity of Time. The way Grushin makes us move back and forth from past to present is a literary feat, which matches Proust, Virginia Woolf or Lawrence Durrell. The breaks in the flow of time, while taking the reader by (delightful) surprise, are never awkward, and always consistent with the psychological evolution of the characters. With stunningly crafted descriptions of Sukhanov's surroundings, with an ideal choice of words, repetition of these words, and switches between the first and the third person, Grushin projects Sukhanov's stream of consciousness onto the reader in a way I found addictive."
4,"unique, beautiful read","Words beautifully written, very enjoyable read, one of a kind based on Russian art history. It's a truely unique book."
4,not a middle-life crisis,"The easiest thing is to dismiss the plot of this book as a middle life crisis. I grew up in the former Soviet Union, and, having lived for many years in this land as well,know that American reader tends to assume that what is true in this country is also true elsewhere.There is a big gap between the USA and the former Soviet Union in terms of mortality age. In the eighties Russian men, in particular, died around Sukhanov's age, in their fifties. He is not dealing with the middle-life crisis, he is dealing with the meaning of life itself. This is not a question of youthful mistakes and ""sell-outs'(which, as we all sadly know happen all very easily in every society); it is an attempt, in a very classic Russian tradition, to deal with our all too fleeting and painful existence on this Earth - under circumstances that offer us little choice. He is dealing with death."
2,Too Many Ham Fisted Mistakes,"First problem with this book is the constant shifting from 1st to 3 person perspective. It is meant to be a device to bring you into the ""Dream Life"" but ends up just being jarring and seems amateurish. I'm really surprised that it got published that way. It can happen at any time and usually happens several times in a chapter.The second problem is the ending. Is he mentally ill now, the new messiah of Soviet era art? Both? Neither? The ending is just vague and irritating. Mental illness doesn't make you an artistic genius, and believing you are somehow becoming a genius in your own head doesn't make it so or make for an uplifting ending, if that is what was intended.Grushin also makes the mistake of a lot of Russian writers in that she descends into psuedo-Christian, messianic bathos.I bought this book in Moscow since the book stores don't have much choice in English language books. I wish I had gone home empty handed instead."
3,an enlightening though strange book,A well written story giving insight into the repressions of the communist regieme on creative artists in Prague and the personal problems that capitulating to the pressures caused the main character.
3,Sizes run small,"I wear a size medium in pretty much every glove I have ever tried on so that is the size I ordered. They are very tight. I do like the glove, but would recommend you order a size up from what you normally wear."
2,too small,I ordered these gloves in XL - but they were too small. Not worth sending back - shipping too expensive.
5,Properly Silly Story: Can be Acted Out,"After all, a JUDGE should know.Who are these dimwits to tell him so:That ""a HORRIBLE THING is coming this way,Creeping closer day by day.""They're liars, scoundrels, nincompoops.Never a JUDGE would ever stoopTo act upon such brainless chatter,But thoroughly dismiss the matter.But, as the judge prepares to leaveHis body shakes from sleeve to sleeve;For that Horrible Thing is at the doorTo gobble HIM up...and look for more.(This is not the story, which is a story, of course. In fact, it's a lie. But it's fun to believe.)[The book does not seem to end properly, so my students concluded the book when storyreading to primary students with the last stanza above.]The Creative Teacher: Activities for Language Arts (Grades 4 through 8 and Up)"
5,The Judge,"The book was in excellent condition. This book is unfortunately out of print, so it was great score to find this as a used book for my grandson."
3,Mixed Feelings,"I was surprized at the ending but it did not bother my kids, they thought it was funny. They understood the irony of the judge being the one eaten."
1,Inappropriate For Young Children,"In fairness to the author, the story is amusing to a point. But is the gory ending necessary? If giving young children nightmares is the aim of this book, then the author/illustrator certainly will hit their mark. A person being eaten by a wild imaginary beast is something I'm very sorry for having exposed my children to."
2,Uncomfortable fit,"Underwear is a pain to buy. Surprisingly expensive and you can't really try it on at the store before buying. I've been a fan of Undergear's brand underwear, but it is pricey. I was trying to find a suitable, less expensive alternative. I gave the hanes a try. Fabric was thinner, elastic sharp and the overall fit was just odd. I think I'll stick with undergear product."
1,Don't even think about it,"This is the worst vacuum cleaner I have ever used in my life. Why? I'll tell you!1- Works for about 5-10 minutes before shutting off due to ""over-heating""2- Suction? It's more like moving dirt around to other areas of the floor3- The cord is much too short4- Attachments are a joke, a big joke.5- Did I mention it has NO suction?6- Oh, I've only owned it 2 months.I wish I would've not thrown away the box when I got it, that way I could return this horrid excuse of a vacuum."
3,$2 at yard sale,"My wife bought this at a yard sale yesterday for $2..I thought man we just payed to throw away someone elses trash. The head would not stay on and it wouldnt suck up anything. So I took it to the garage and blew out the air filter took the hose off and there was a pen, marker and a AA battery. I screwed the head on with a dry wall screw. After cleaning and removing those items I brought it inside to try it out. We have all hardwood and tile floors it did a great job for $2 bucks. I would recommend this product but just know that it is not for big jobs and you shouldnt expect that out of something so small."
5,Shark Vacuum Cleaner,"My wife love this cleaner. It is light ,easy to use and does an excellent job. Highly recommend it. Vendor did a perfect job of getting it here on time."
2,Back to the drawing board,Purchased this vac. to perform quick clean up jobs and was quite impressed with it when I saw it in the store as it is quite light and compact. It has a major problem however and that is that it won't pick up anything on a carpet surface. It dosen't produce much suction which is probably the fault of an undersized motor. It works a little better on hard surfaced floors but the design of the air discharge directly in the front the unit blows the dust away from the front of the cleaner head making it a challange to catch up with the dust bunnies. I wouldn't waste the money on this cleaner unless you enjoy going through the motions just for the arm exercise. I gave the unit two stars only because it has a nice automatic cord retractor. Too bad that they couldn't have provided a vacume cleaner to go along with it.
2,"Filter impossible to get, bad cust. serv.","My mom bought this vac for my apartment, it did okay on the plush carpet, but maybe it was just because there wasnt much to pickup on the new carpet. Two months after purchase, I dropped the filter in the toliet and threw it out. Big Mistake! I've looked in 6 major stores, no filter-not even 2 of the stores who sell them. I purchased one online from their website, I never received it, or my money back and no response from the company! This is enough for me to stop using it. The only feature I liked was the short, but retractrable cord-I hate winding cords up. I won't buy anything from this co. again."
1,This Vacuum Blows!,"DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY. Do NOT buy this vacuum, it is a joke and is just terrible. It barely has any suction power, and you can forget using the head like a normal vacuum. It will blow everything away instead of sucking it up - and it only has a hole in the middle of the head, so it will only (barely) suck up what is directly over that hole on the floor. I only tried it on wood floor and it did a terrible job on that. The only think i can use it for is the extension, and it will only pick up the lightest of particles. IT SUCKS and not in a good way. Plus when you use the extension, it only goes so far and the vacuum will fall over on you. I hate this vacuum! Now I have to go buy something decent. Do yourself a favor, spend some more money and get something that works!"
1,Can't Recommend,"Thought I'd take a minute out while packing this vacuum for a return and share my thoughts. I can't recommend it for any purpose. The filter gets clogged in no time, suction decreases, you're forced to clean the filter which creates a mess, and then your cleaning up the mess your vacuum made!?!?!?!? Where's the sense in that? The dirt cup ain't all that and a bag of chips either. Save your money and your sanity, pass on this one.I ended up with an Orick ElectrikBroom. It was approximately three times more expensive than the EuroPro, but it's 10 times the machine."
1,All men are rotten,This doesn't even come close to being called a decent film; the plot sucks and the fights are very sloppy. Definitely NOT worth buying this in blu-ray either because you will not be able to tell the difference between the resolutions
5,Summers with Juliet,"This memoir records the struggles of a young writer trying to find his literary voice by portraying his distraction, frustrations, and devotions to his art through his adventures with his future wife as they encounter a variety of people and animals--turkeys, turtles, hummingbirds, and bluefishes--in many beautiful natural environments. Their adventures are always fascinating andamusing, and, at times, exciting."
4,I love this shoe,I have ordered four pairs of shoes on-line recently. All but this one was made very cheaply made. This pair is just beautiful. Wish I could find it at this price in yellow.
3,ok,"The only reason I am NOT thrilled with this is ........ first i ordered wrong bed a small, the heat element was smaller than the bed but ok for that size. The large bed had the SAME SIZE element!! I thought perhaps the heat would distribute but My dog like to lay where the element is and curls up on it. The company took the return no charge ( also ordered 2 more as gifts).Bottom line is dog is happy, but the element should be appropriately sized for each bed."
5,Works fine in a 2002 Jeep Liberty,Picked up a set of these to install some new JVC speakers in my Jeep Liberty. Installation is very straightforward - it takes longer to remove the door panel and old speakers than it does to install the brackets and new speakers.
3,Barely works for the Jeep Wrangler 2010,"For the dash and rollbar speakers, it works but you have do some modification to the brackets. It's the only bracket I could find for my jeep. It gets the job done, just not done well."
5,Small shelf,Fits nicely into the cupboard and just the right height. I get more use out the the space and utilize the cabinet better.
4,like most of rick mofina's books,"i still have this in my kindle to read later , one of the better thriller writers arounddecent series"
2,Bloody Boring...,"I thought this book was way too dragged out (could have cut out about 150 pages), had too many characters, none of which were fully fleshed out and redundant. I actually gave up at 288 pages. Couldn't wait any longer for some action."
4,It's what you expect,"This product is fine, especially for oversized or weirdly shaped items like the silver butter dish I keep in it."
2,"Good intentions, but ...","This movie has a nice set-up: a love story between two frat brothers. However, the plot crumbles and turns into a preachy little Gay After School Special. You can tell that this movie has cheap production values: the mouths don't move in sync with what you hear."
4,Defying Gravity,"This is just a good mushy love story. The acting is a little rough around the edges, but the story line makes up for it. I am a college senior and my friends said that this seemed like a college thesis film from the film school. I have to admit the ending brought tears to my eyes, but I am a hopeless romantic. Overall I would recomend this to any one who likes sappy love stories."
3,'Coming out' drama has its heart in the right place,"DEFYING GRAVITY(USA - 1997)Aspect ratio: 1.37:1Theatrical soundtrack: MonoCloseted frat boy Griff (Daniel Chilson) is forced to come to terms with his sexuality when his boyfriend (Don Handfield) is the victim of a violent assault. Writer-director John Keitel's debut feature is an earnest, likeable portrait of campus life where conformity is the norm and gay students are implicitly discouraged from finding their true identity. However, the underwritten script stumbles badly over a number of crucial scenes, which means the intended dramatic sparks never really ignite, and the performances are merely OK. That said, characters are sympathetic and the narrative still has a lot of social relevance. Ultimately, the film's heart is in the right place and it works on its own modest level."
4,"Solid, if unspectacular","Griff and Pete are fellow students and lovers. Griff wants their affair to be a secret, playing the straight game, while Pete wants the opposite. Then, one night, a brutal assault takes place..Defying gravity has many strengths, among them a levelheaded script and some very restrained acting by Daniel Chilson and Niklaus Lange. It strives to be more than just a [homosexual]teenage movie by keeping the emotions in check, stearing clear of provocative scenes. This is admirable, even if the result often looks like a TV-movie of the week. The danger just isn't there.Still, all the characters are interesting, even the bad guys. The script holds back enough information to keep you guessing, and the ending is quite acceptable.Note: The word ""[homasexual]"" isn't used at all in the script! Other defamatory expressions for [homosexual] people are frequent, though.There is a scene right after the end-credits which you shouldn't miss. Don't turn off until you get there!"
3,GOOD MOVIE,Really enjoyed the movie and well written and acted. Need more GAy movies like this! Now if I can only find the Soundtrack!
1,A pretty face is not enough,"The storyline, the poor audio, the unbearable cliches... and below it all... the acting: you never believe for an instant that Griff was even trying to pretend to be straight and was such a frat guy...a most popular one - supposedly; the annoying mugging, facial exaggerations and over acting were pretty unbearable. This was such a bad movie - diappointing, mindless, and left me thinking I'd just wasted my money and time.Rent it if you have to."
3,Falling a little short ...,"Defying Gravity ...Someone was trying to defy something in the the editing room. There is always more to anything, except when it comes to the soundtrack of this great story line film. If only more work whent into the sound. I hope the producers learn from this and any future works will surpass thier endeavours in this one. This is one movie that people should see , too bad they won't hear it."
4,"Great Movie, Good Story & Cute Guys","This was a good movie. Good story, well written, acting was ok. The guys were cute. Its seemed to be a true to life story."
3,"Cute, Believable Relationship","My first impression at the beginning of the movie was : TV movie. Loooked like it. Then it proved to be a little too gay for the late 90s, which was when it was made, so it couldn't be. This movie has its flaws in production and some of the actors, and the plotline wasn't startling original. but it was worth the rental. Thankfully the two leads were believable and cute; the ending where they kiss and joke together is actually quite touching. And in the credits where they have the extra scene where Griff jumps into bed with Pete--its so cute and realistic, like a real couple.My last comment is, how did they find all these good looking straight guys that were openminded enough to make a gay movie?"
3,Defying Gravity,"As much as I liked this film, I think that the dvd presentation would have benefitted from a commentary by John Keitel who wrote and directed the film. I would have liked to have heard his views on the how's and why's of the film, the characters and the actors. Despite a few continuity issues, editing glitches and stiff performances, this is a pretty good film that tells an important and timely story."
1,Could have been so much more.....,"I was very disappointed in this film partly because it was poorly written, partly because the acting was terrible but mostly because it missed its potential. The idea was very simple and important and could have made a great film. As it was, poor actors working with even worse dialog made this a most difficult film to watch. Even though I nearly turned this movie off after the first 10 minutes and again after every additional 10 minutes, it does have a few good points. You will have to search hard to find them and that is if you can get past the first 10 minutes. A very disappointing film overall."
3,This could have been so much more,"OK-- this could have been a really compelling movie, but the characters of the three male leads weren't really developed enough. And it seemed to me that although the movie seems to be a plea to treat homosexuality openly and hoinestly, the movie shied away from showing gay sexuality at all. For me this made the movie hollow. ""Longhorns"", although it was supposed to be a comedy, did a much better job telling the story."
1,Refund,"This was by far the WORST MOVIE EVER. I have seen better scripts done by 1st graders and whoever the actor was who played, ""Griff"", go back to which ever state you came from. Who ever said you could act, lied to you. I wish I knew someone at Amazon so I could get my money and the hour and a half of my life back."
2,Not recommended,"I was disappointed in ""Defying Gravity."" It reminded me of an after-school TV special -- mediocre script, so-so acting, uninspired direction. It was predictable all the way, with no real surprises. There are certainly lots of cute boys to look at, but other than that it's pretty much a waste of time."
1,How bad was it?....................................It stunk!,Did you see the long pause in my title. Expect that throughout the film. It's like the actors were struggling to read the cue-cards in the backround. Several statements and scenes make no sense whatsover...
1,Stupid Movie,"I've never seen such bad writing and acting in a movie until I saw ""Defying Gravity."" It was slow from beginning to end and the ending was way too cliche. Probably the worst gay themed movie I've ever seen."
1,Rent It First !!!,"Based on the plot summary and customer reviews of this movie, I took a chance and bought it without seeing it first. It seemed like it was a gay ABC Afterschool Special. The actors didn't seem sincere and the relationship between Griff and Pete was never really developed...When Todd asks Griff if he really loves Jack, and his reply was ""I've never been more sure about anything in my life"", I had to ask WHY!!! I hadn't seen anything up to that point that would have lead me to believe it.This movie will make me think twice before buying another movie, sight unseen. Be warned!!!"
1,Defying Acting,"I was not impressed with the final product of Defying Gravity. Add Meredith Baxter and it would have made the perfect ABC After School Special. There is a tremendous amount of overacting running rampant in this movie. Most of the guys seemed to come from the Anthony Michael Hall school of acting. It had a good story line but the final product turned me off. If you want to see this movie, stop, turn around and pick up the first thing your hand passes on the video shelf."
1,defying belief,"This movie had only 4 flaws. They were the acting, directing, editing and photography. The production was sophomoric and amateurish. Some of it was edited so sloppily that it did not even make sense. The actors were so self conscious and their acting so contrived that no one was believable. It was difficult to sit through the whole thing but I felt I should suffer through this hodge-podge piece of idiocy since I had paid so much for it. I would have rated it 0 stars if it had been available.it made me cry too...tears of despair. rent it before you buy it. Of course there is no acccounting for taste. So if you are 14 and this is the only movie you ever see. spend your money on some counseling sessions"
2,Zero gravity; defying entropy,"A low-budget film, kind of a cross between a made-for-tv movie and a soap opera, but more poorly done. If you cut the scenes in which people stare into the distance thoughtfully, the movie would be a half-hour shorter. Good for people who want to exercise by shifting uncomfortably. It has one redeeming feature: Daniel Chilson -- who, unsurprisingly, has not acted before or since -- is photogenic and terminally cute. He actually shows that it is possible for one person to have too much cuteness. The slight facial twitches and sensitive eye-squints are particularly endearing."
2,Product Description,"Popular frat guy, Griff, &quot;the ultimate boy next door&quot;, has a great big secret: Pete. Given an ultimatum by Pete, Griff goes the straight route until things get rough. Ultimately, defying reality, is harder than he had ever imagined."
5,Good films do not need big budgets,This is a simple yet beautiful film. I think that it says a lot about human nature and our ability to triumph over fears. I was not expecting much; and I love it when I am pleasantly suprised.This film has heart.
4,A pleasant &#65533; if flawed &#65533; surprise,"A friend of mine made me watch this and I wasn't expecting much. I've found most gay-themed movies to be fairly trite and burdened by poor acting and low production quality. ""Defying Gravity"" suffers from some subpar performances and, cinematically speaking, it's not much. (It sort of looks like an ""Afterschool Special."") But its heart is in the right place, and it remains surprising throughout. There are also some wonderful touches. My favorite is when Griff and Pete, who are secret lovers, are hiking with their oblivious straight friend, Todd. The two lovers fall back a moment to check out their friend's butt. It's a quiet, funny moment. Also be sure to catch a bittersweet interlude in a tree and a great joke about boxer shorts. If you look past its flaws, you'll see that ""Defying Gravity"" is a sweet, big-hearted movie."
3,A realistic gay story,"I wasn't sure what to expect when I bought the movie, but I was pleasantly surprised. Yes, this is a low-budget movie, but I really enjoyed the fact that it tells the story of so many people around the world. Someone, in college, is starting to come to terms with being gay. Every expression, every comment that Griff makes, when he turns away from his best friend and his girlfriend when they kiss, I can relate. Not everyone here is out and loud and waiting to sleep with everyone else. The movie shows the many stages of coming out, with Pete much more comfortable of himself than Griff. I was a bit disappointed that some of the scenes were predictable and the gay-bashing to get Griff out of the closet was not necessarily needed, although it did show how homophobic some of the frat brothers were (and not just the ones who were responsible). Maybe this film will help other college students face their being gay."
1,Poor Design - Poor Performance - Poor Product,"Watch Winders typically turn clockwise, then counter-clockwise, then pause. This is all they do. However, the SWI winder only goes one way, forever. A call to Rolex said that it should alternate. Sorry! This is a ""F"" and should go back to the designer for a re-work."
5,Really cool frames.,"These frames are really fun. It looks like your document or picture is floating on the wall. I loved them so much, I bought another set. The only weird thing was that they come out of the plastic dirty....like, really dirty. But they clean up fine with a little glass cleaner. I'm very happy with these purchases."
3,Hit and Miss Dance Classix,"You should get this cd for ""Trip II the Moon"" and ""Close Your Eyes"" because they are amazing trax and are very hard to find. I remember the first time i heard ""close your eyes."" they are 2 classic gems from the early 90s by Acen. Other highlights include the infamous ""sesame street techno song""--""Sesame's Treet"" and other early hardcore anthems."
1,Not worth the money,"This book is a waste of time. It does not contain exercises to help you apply the principals to your specific issues with customer or employees. It was very general and did not teach me anything that I did not already know. The book was way too expesive, as well."
3,Once Upon a Fairy Tale,"The condition of the book was fine. HOWEVER, it was missing the CD. This mattered to me because I wanted to give the book to a child who is learning to read. The description did not indicate that anything from the book was missing. I was able to work the problem out with the distributor with little effort. They get an A+ for their quick response in resolving it."
3,Nu Bossa - Not the Same as the Old Bossa :-),"This is a fine collection of Nu Bossa/Latin Tinged Trip Hop orBossa Trip Hop Acid Jazz - just don't confuse it with the Bossa Nova most people know so well.And yes, there are only 12 tracks."
4,Good Introduction,"If you are interested in Kama Sutra, Ananga Ranga or The Perfumed Garden or are not sure which you would like to study, this book is a great starting point. Although all the works are very similiar, this allows you a synopsis of each text and is helpful in determing which or all that you wish to persue further. The illustrations are beautifully done. Not for in-depth reading or review, but more an icebreaker."
2,AN ENLIGHTENING EXPERIANCE.,"I really enjoyed the superb graphics and very informative text. Whether you are celebate or sexually active, you must accept the fact that a very big part of the human experiance is sexual. The Kama Sutra can strip away the un-neccesary shame and guilt that the pragmatic western philosophies have instilled upon our culture. Sex is a perfectly natural and neccesaery form of communication and means of survival of the species. Mark A. Yenichek"
5,Kama Sutra,I'm sure this will be a fine book once I get more involved with it. I bought it as a reference book but have been preoccupied with a few other books I bought so have not given it the time it deserves.
2,The only game in town - too bad it's junk,"I really wanted a vertical easel binder. Too bad this Cardinal seems to be the only one available. It came with the top rivet pulled out of the clasp. Exchanged it for another - same thing. I would have returned the 2nd one for a refund, but as far as I know there is no other replacement available for this poor excuse for workmanship.So, I drilled out the rivet, installed a 6-32 screw and finish washer from the outside with a t-nut on the inside. A dab of epoxy so it won't loosen. If I knew I was going to have to 'build my own' binder I wouldn't have paid $12.72 for it!"
5,Most readable book on the subject of Victorian England,"I've been reading about the Victorians for a number of years. I tend to consume subjects, reading book and book, until I've satisfied my curiosity. Picard's Victorian London is the best written of them all and answered my most pressing questions concerning the Victorians. Her order is logical and her descriptions memorable. I had previously read a lot of descriptions of the Crystal Pavilion but only Picard's book walked me through the exhibition. The book also helped me realize I no longer wish for a time machine to transport me back to a simpler time. I think the Thames is just lovely now and it sounds as if it was rather nasty 150 years ago. I highly recommend the book."
3,In Flanders' Field,"Were it not for the availability of Judith Flanders' ""Inside the Victorian Home"", Ms. Picard's treatment of the subject period would definitely be worth the read. But compared to ""Inside"", this book is neither as well written nor as comprehensive in its treatment of the day-to-day lives of our Victorian forebears."
1,Keep in mind...,"I'm a history major, so I tried to read this book for historiography (the study of how history has been documented). Compared to the historians we studied in this class, Picard's writing is extremely disappointing. While she has an overall agenda, advocating that the Victorian Era wasn't all it's cracked up to be, her writing is bland and forgettable. Especially considering in the introduction, Picard writes, ""I took an authorial decision at a very early stage: no novels, no poems."" This is the VICTORIAN ERA people! The lived and breathed novels and poems! The one redeeming value: nice cover art."
4,An excellent and readable resource!,"Honestly, I bought this book entirely because it had a chapter called ""Smells"". I'm working on a project set in Victorian London, and I was having a devil of a time writing about how the city smelled, for obvious reasons. This book saved my literary bacon. From sewers to corsetry, servants' quarters to velocipedes, this book is an invaluable resource. If you're a history buff, a trivia nerd, or trying to write steampunk (hello!), this is the book for you. I only wish it had covered the later Victorian period as well; it stops at 1870, and I could have done with stuff on the 1880s and 1890s. Ah, well, you can't have everything."
4,Very solid...,"Klute combines dark rhythms with bright melody better than most DnB artists I've heard. If your into artists like Dieselboy, Black Sun Empire and Aphex Twin (the early vinyls), you'll probably like Klute.Listen to disc 2 first. Disc 1 is an experimental vocal mix and unlike Klute.My rating is based on DnB in general, not comparing this to his other albums which I have not heard all of."
5,"Precious Magid, THANK YOU!","I absolutely love this book! I try to read about the Besht every day and this has become my very favorite reference. The stories are all inspiring and some even bring tears to my eyes and I think, ""I want to be someone the Besht would be proud of,"" and try to live accordingly. I wish, I wish, I wish I could get a print of the painting on the cover! It's beautiful and I would love to have it over my fireplace.Thank you for giving us this wonderful book"
3,Covert Baily I love you,"Covert tells you like it is, and this set is good for your health collection of books. Keep it there, and watch it ever so often to remind yourself what your body is ""really doing"" when you eat the bad foods.But buy used."
1,YAWN.,"The topic is interesting. But not worth the rental fee. If it was a buck, maybe. Anymore than that, you will be overpaying."
2,"A bore, a prototype","The only reason I bought Petrarch was that I was told by a professor that he founded the whole lovesick thing and invented the love sonnet. But this is a case of someone being famous for doing something first and not so much for doing it well. His poems are full of sick, but not of love; there is no feeling that translates into you as a reader, he just tells you how much he is in love and it stays academic and distant. Some of these poems are good but most I read and didn't absorb or feel effected by at all. I sold my copy and would recommend a library check out first- if you love him from sampling, then buy this, its a beautiful volume, good size and weight, well printed, it has every poem."
5,Classic reference for information systems management,"I located this book by accident when searching the stacks at the library and I'm sure glad I did.Information systems references have mushroomed in the past few years. What I liked about this book is that it provides information that is applicable to any IT/IS project. Even in the age of ecommerce, these basic skills of understanding databases, tables, and relationships is critical.Illustrations make abstract concepts easy to learn and understand.Whether you are on a project and getting on the job training or just want to train yourself for your next job, a reference such as this is invaluable."
1,well deserved,"Any protagonist who is stupid enough to put up with what Kate Mulcay does in this book deserves the results. She doesn't make sure the relatives are actually related; she keeps being devestated by their well meaning but dreadful attempts to help around the house; but never so much as suggests that they check with her before doing things. She gives them cash to spend even when she knows that it goes for liquor instead of food, and then she hands over a credit card and doesn't require it back. When handed the perfect excuse that it's ""mislaid"", she neither demands nor cancels it. Besides that, I figured out the perpetrators of the murder before it even happened. I would not have finished up the book if I hadn't been hard up for reading material. The one positive point for this book is that the author has a reasonably decent writing style."
2,A Christian way of looking at Zen,"This book tries to explain Zen concepts by quoting passages from the bible (the bible says this which really means this). If you are a devout Christian having trouble relating to Zen concepts like ""no mind"" then this book might help you reconcile such concepts with your Christian beliefs. For most readers I think this book will be more like tuning your TV to one of the religious channels."
2,Barely Works For Me,"Even 4 capsules, it's hard to notice any effect; less pain relief than 2 ibuprofen. I was hoping for something more."
5,More terrific!,"If you read & enjoyed MAC FOR DUMMIES, you will Love this one. It is even funnier& more informative than MAC FOR DUMMIES. It will help you with all those questions you are afraid to call Apple about because you think they will write ""DUH"" next to your name in a secret Mac File and you will sound like the numero uno Mac expert at the next users meeting or in the office with very little effort on your part. Mr. pogue does all the heavy lifting & we benefit. Thank you for another great Mac book, Mr. Pogue. Keep 'em coming. Eileen"
4,Good Info,"This is a readable, technically insightful, USABLE guide. Its relaxed tone makes the work of learning easier.JG"
1,Censored,"I bought this because I am a Tinto Brass fan also. ""The Key"" has to be a classic, there is sex, but there is a good plot also, and it keeps you interested and guessing. But what is disappointing about ""PO Box Tinto Brass"" is the Korean censorship. Flashes of fog appear where there should be female parts. This is most annoying and interrupts what continuity there is. I was taken in by the line: 'This is the ORIGINAL theatrical release as envisioned by Tinto Brass with the original Italian soundtrack.' I'm pretty sure this is not the way Tinto had envisioned his film would appear."
1,"Caution, unless you speak Italian","I bought this because I am a big Tinto Brass fan. What the advertising above does not tell you is that although this an all-region DVD, it's in Italian with only Korean subtitles. So unless you speak Italian or read Korean, you may want to pass on this one."
1,Small describes the box,"Bought this for our daughter's 4th birthday, and found the tools are ok - the problem I have is that the box is way too small to fit the toys back into it. I had a hard time doing it, let alone a four year old."
2,Great for a boy or a girl except ...,We got this for our 2 year old daughter. She loves loves watching mommy doing work around the house. Now she has her own set. She walks around looking for things to repair.This set is really great and sturdy. My daughter bangs on everything with the hammer. I think she has done more damage to the table top of her KidKraft setKidKraft Farmhouse Table & Chair Setthan any of these tools.Note: The latch on the tool box easily comes off but with a snap it goes back on.UPDATE: Within a week or so my child managed to get the hammer and other tools apart. They break too easily. In the trash this set went.
2,ok toy,This is ok but I wish I had seen the Handy Many tool set before I purchased this one. My son loves how the tools in the Many set talk.
1,Not happy at all,The top broke off within 5 minutes and then the latch. would not recommend this to anybody am not happy at all
2,Flagello's own creation is her problem,I loved the approach that Dr. Flagello used while reading this book. It helped me to fully understand the basics of becoming an entrepreneur except for the many feminist views. I noticed several references to worthless information that just extended the book to over 100 pages. Too much useless information. This book is only good for one thing...kindling.
3,Ok Hungarian movie,"Sunday's Daughters - for some reason Amazon only goes by its foreign titleThis movie is about a detention home of troublesome teenage girls. The movie mainly focuses on Juli, played well by Julianna Nyako who would also be in an unavaliable Janos Rozsa film Kabala. Juli doesn't like the detention home and runs to home often where she's even less wanted. A widow takes her out of pity but Juli ruins that by starting a relationship with her teenage son. At the end Juli has even less freedom than when she started.This kind of reminded me of the Linda Blair tv movie ""Born Innocent"", although that was more entertaining but less realistic. 2.5 rounded to 3."
3,face guard problem,A good helmut except that the face guard comes too close to the face. I couldn't wear it because the guard was so close to my nose that it fogged up the plastic. Had to return it.
5,Really fantastic... a great deal too,"After returning from a trip to St. Petersburg, where I had to rely on brief guidebooks, I decided to pick up this Living Language course to learn Russian. I bought this one because it was in my price range, but that turned out to be a great thing. The explanations of grammar are really clear, and there are plenty of charts inside. Being able to hear the words as you read them in Cyrillic is wonderful; if you get too used to reading them in regular letters you'll never know how to read the signs for the bathroom! I recently called some Russian friends in St. Petersburg, and they told me my Russian is great! I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn Russian correctly, without spending way too much money."
2,The Chamber is Still a Secret!!!,"Don't buy this game. The parts that work are fun, but there are so many hang ups, freezes, and blank screens that the fun quickly becomes pure frustration. Not too far into the game, you simply cannot proceed. Aspyr informed me that they were aware of the problems and were working on fixes. They also said this was ""mostly"" a problem with OS 9 users."
1,Very disappointing,"Game had problems playing on OS9. ""Customer support"" states theres a ""glitch"". Invested in OSX, game continues to freeze. No patches or fixes available."
1,Don't Buy This!!!!!,Don't waste your money on this game!!! All it does is freeze up. It is slow and full of bugs. What a waste of money and time. They say there is a patch -- but won't say when. This game should never have been released to the public.
2,Mac OS 9 Users Beware,"My five year old son and I played ""Sorcerer's Stone"" together and loved it. I ordered ""Chamber of Secrets"" despite the posted comments about its ""bugginess"". Once we loaded it and gave it plenty of memory the game ran perfectly until...I estimate about a third of the way through, as we shifted from one ""challenge trial"" to another, the screen went irrevocably black, which in effect ended the game. I called Aspyr and the tech knew just what had happened as all players who are running OS 9 experience this. He told me that they are working on a patch for this problem but he doesn't know when it will be available. We'll probably wait for the patch as we loved the first third (some real improvements over ""Sorcerer's Stone). Hadn't even gotten to the first Quidditch match."
3,Good fun with a glitch,The game is great...if you can get it to play. Running the game with OS 9.2.2 their is a glitch that the manufacture (Aspyr) has yet to make a fix for. They say a patch is coming but for the mean time you can only play up through Prof. Flitwick's challange. That aside this game seems much more elaborate and better developed than the first one.
2,BUGGY BUGGY BUGGY,"I am running OS X (10.2.6) and the program is incredibly buggy. Very frustrating for adults, but a total deal-breaker for kids! There are problems saving and problems crashing. We had problems with the last Potter game, too, but subsequent patches from Aspyr and the use of cheat codes to jump levels (to avoid game freezes) saved the day. There are no patches from Aspyr yet for Chamber of Secrets and I am not inclined to go through the painful rigamarole of helping them fix a program which feels like it is barely out of the beta stage of development. AVOID."
1,Major Glitch Problem,"I can watch the first three cut scenes and that is all.It glitches while attempting to load the actual game (the start by the whomping willow). Can't tell you if the game has other glitches, I can't get past the first one.I'm on an OS X 10.6.8."
3,Cute dog toy!,"I purchased this for my boxer lab. He thinks it is okay. I thought it would stretch more. He plays with it a little, but it is not his favorite toy."
2,"My labrador liked this toy, but seriously, he destroyed it is one minute and it was trashed.",This toy might be a winner for a dog that does not try to tear toys up. It is not durable and has appendages that are quickly ripped and torn. I gave this toy to my labrador and within two minutes I had to trash it.
5,A heartwarming family book,"I have read this book 10 times over the past 15 years. It is a wonderful read of a young family transplanted in America. Warm, funny and even sad at time. A book for all in your family to read."
3,Visco elastic memory foam,"Item arrived as scheduled and I would purchase from seller again. Still not sure if I like sleeping on memory foam, we have this on a bed in the spare bedroom. I have slept on it once and found it a bit firm."
3,"Soft Sleeper 3"" Twin Mattress size",This item is very comfortable but I had a problem with it contributing to night sweats that I already was having. I ended up removing it thus helping with the body warmth problem but I sure do miss the comfort of it.
2,had to return it,This item caused two difficult nights when I woke several times due to a burning sensation. It was like sleeping on plastic.
1,Regret,"I bought 2 toppers, a 3"" Latex(from another company) and a 3"" memory foam from this company - the 'good one' the 5.5. Both were in twin format. I have had a memory foam topper before but went cheap so was not surprised when it turned out to be rubbish, this was 5 years ago. I picked my goods up stateside and am not in a position to return this item hence the title. This is very cheap foam. I do not believe, although I cannot prove, this foam is the 5.5 good quality foam used on higher end mattresses - so don't think you are getting that. My piece was 2 6/8"" thick. There is a smell, it's not that bad but it's strong. There is no difference from buying this to a piece of firm foam. Don't believe all this hype, I would be Very Surprised if you were not disappointed, either save your money or spend more and buy quality memory foam. On a side note the latex topper is exceptionally comfortable so I figure 1 outa 2 aint bad. the latex cost $200 though."
5,Back Pain!!,"I've just received my Twin XL 3-inch thick 5.5 lb. density Visco Elastic Memory Foam Mattress Topper from All-Sleep (Via Amazon). I'm 75 years old, weigh 260 pounds and have had beck pain for years that surgery didn't eliminate. I've slept two nights on it now without ANY back pain---the first two nights for at least twenty years!I like it so well I've ordered a thick cotton mattress cover and a memory foam pillow for it and plan to buy a one or two inch 4 lb density topper to go on top of it. I hope this is helpful to someone. Dick McKillop [...]"
4,comfortable sleep,Received item quickly. Purchased this to use over a firm mattress that left my back aching in the morning. This is much more comfortable and I wake up much more rested and less back pain.
2,Not convenient for small fish,"I have smaller fish - guppies and mollies. For them, the granules and even crisps (disks) are too big to swallow whole and too hard to break up. The particles fall to the bottom too quickly, before the fish can tackle them, then get lost among the gravel and rot. The granules even color the water red! I find flakes (crushed up) much better for small fish - the fish can eat them right away, and don't need to wrestle with them or wait for the water to loosen and soften them."
3,Poet's attempt at mystery,"John Peale Bishop was primarily a poet and journalist, and as far as I know this was his only novel. He died fairly young, and might well have written more had he lived.The novel is set in the South, where Bishop grew up (in his case the part of West Virginia near Virginia), and by now that world of the Border South in the 1910s or 20s seems very foreign.The act is a rape; the novel follows the set-up and the consequences of an act that most polite people won't even name, let alone discuss.I read this novel out of family curiosity--he was my grandfather."
5,The great parapsychology book looking at Auras with science,"This book should be an inspiration to all parapsychologists. He stays completely in the realm of science careful not to sway the audience. His main acheivement is proving the existence of the Aura. Yet, he goes further trying to find applications to his discovery. He surveys some people to get a general idea of the norm conditions of a healthy person. He also tries looking at a few sick people to see if the physical can cause auric effects. He asks his readers if they can continue investigating his findings by providing the screens neccessary for auric sight. Yet, the screens aren't provided any more which makes this book its only flaw. That, however, does not sway my decision about this book being one of the greatest science books written and any laymen can follow without any problems understanding. He doesn't get the recognition he deserves. One of the greatest parapsychologists ever."
1,Didn't work on MacIntosh - Customer Service Terrible,"Given to us as a gift - when we went to start it our Mac (OS X 10.2.8 which booted up Mac Classic 9.2 to start the program) didn't recognize the CD. OK - so we called the customer service number on the box - it's been disconnected. So we went to the JumpStart Website, found the customer service e-mail address and sent an e-mail - 14 days later, still no reply. So we searched the web and found a new customer service number (not an 800 number) and got someone who was polite but didn't understand English very well, and had no advice to offer except to return it with a receipt, but.... it was a gift so we have no receipt. That stumped him.Is this a company that deserves your support?"
2,Disappointed with pronunciation,I was disappointed with the American accent of the characters' voices - they should have used native speakers. I am a native speaker of Latin American Spanish and prefer Kidspeak software - even though it teaches the European Spanish pronuciation
1,Freezes up my computer.,"My kids loved this program - for about five minutes. Then the computer freezes up. I have a new computer, so it's not a memory issue. We have tried many times. We just can't use this program - and their service people were no help."
4,fun introduction to spanish,"The cd works fine on my daughter's older XP machine. She likes to play the games, and it's a comfortable introduction to Spanish. I don't know how much it is really helping her learn to speak, but if you want something additional to immerse your child in the language, I would recommend this cd. I found it to be a good value for the price."
1,Does not work on a Mac,"This product will only work in a Mac ""Classic"" environment which is no longer supported... so if you have an old mac sitting in your attic, great. Otherwise, buy something else."
1,6 wks later and never received product?,Now I'm going to have to go through the process of contacting the company to figure out why they took my money and never sent product. I don't have time for this!
5,A must see movie,"This could so happen to somebody you know. Or maybe it has already happened to you. Anyway, this Sundance movie is definitely entertaining and has some very funny lines. The kind of lines that you laugh at and then say ohhh, maybe that hit a bit close to home. It is as it should be, it makes you think and reflect. Faraday, played by Jeffery Scott Jensen was the character that hit home for me. He plays the part of the loyal friend, the kind of friend we all need.The whole cast plays their sort of low-key dark rolls so well. The fact that it takes place in Fairbanks Alaska is a perfect setting, what else is there to do in the dead of winter. The location and the climate lets you focus on the characters as well as the story. To me, this is a must have for a video collection. It is the foundation on what Tom Hines movies will be built on. It is the mind numbing cold combined with the mind numbing drugs that lets the director tell the story so well."
3,I found one cheaper...,"This is average, but does what it says it will. I found one about a dollar cheaper under a different brand sticker two days after I bought this one at men's wearhouse."
2,Not a good product,This is not a good product at all....The sponge that is used to apply the polish becomes solid like stone after some time and then it is basically unusable. Of what use is a polish if the sponge is not usable. Had to trash it!!!
2,"Nice form, weak execution","I was very pleased when I opened the box and found a nice chunky, seemingly heavy duty microphone. The hardware is well crafted with good fit and finish.I plugged it in and it self installed quickly and without incident.Now, having tested the microphone for several voice only projects using multiple software applications, the quality of recordins was poor at best. In all cases the volume was VERY low, tinney, and digitized.To eliminate the possibility of computer malfunction or software limitations, I tested this on three computer with two different software applications all with the same results.I would not reccomend this solution."
1,unhappy buyer,Maybe mine came broken...it rattles inside and doesn't record well....my cheap Radio Shack mic does better.
5,"Great Book, Great Value","Book was in mint condition, as described in the Amazon Listing. Since this book was published at the time the Penn Central RR was still in business, it presents a unique look at the entire railroad system as it existed in the early 1970's. Photos are nice, too...but a little sparse, personally.The Vendor was superb in every way in delivering the product to me. I will buy from them again through Amazon."
3,Excellent text but photos deserve better.,"I just purchased this book and found that the text is fascinating and informative as other reviewers have already noted. What disappointed me was that the all black and white photos were reproduced with too much contrast and grain. They remind me of photographs reproduced in newspapers. The quality of pictures is similar to those found in the series ""Images of Rail"". Perhaps I have been spoiled by the MBI series of railroad books but I do believe these pictures deserve better."
3,Fuser Kit,"This came in a timely manner. We haven't had to use it yet so I can't speak to how well it works, but I don't anticipate any problems."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"This time, Masterton goes for demons of the Japanese variety. In this case, the Kappa. This one has a plan for a lot of demonic badness. It aims to do this via possession, and its first target is a man who actually knows about them, and remembers them from world war two.The possession attempt is botched, and takes over the wrong person, leaving them with a live enemy to oppose them."
2,Revolting.,"Masterton is an excellent wordsmith, all the more remarkably so given how prolific he is. I don't find most of his books at all scary, but usually they're well thought out and interesting. I guess ""Tengu"" is well thought out, but it's also revolting. While all of his novels have a respectably high gore quotient, none of the others except ""Fireflash 5"" and ""Burial"" have so MUCH pointlessly sadistic and grotesque violence; and ""Tengu"" does not quite have the saving grace of the former two stories' sheer outlandishness. Masterton's world in ""Tengu"" seems small and squalid, his characters so across-the-board unsympathetic that when the plot resolves itself in nuclear armageddon almost out of the blue, one is more moved by the author's sheer gall than by the situation. One does have to grant, though, that Graham Masterton has always been one of the most original and intriguing talents in the field, and ""Tengu"" is, if nothing else, something no other writer could probably have come up with."
3,Griz,"This novel is about Japanese demons. The background for this novel takes place towards the end of the Pacific conflict about the time the US drops the first atomic bomb. Takes up about 1970s. Its all about payback, revenge for the aftermath of the first A bomb dropped on Japan. This novel has got a little bit of everything, from corrupt business dealings to geopolitical dogma to blood and guts action. I was not to impressed with this novel. For some reason the author strayed from his usually successful formula of esoteric storytelling to one that second guesses decisions made that ended the Pacific War Conflict. If you are an avid reader of this authors novels, stay away from this one. You will be disappointed."
1,A mis-introduction...,Throughly confusing. Of very little value to the cs student. Detrimental to the aspiring Java professional.
2,Those looking to learn Java should continue searching,"This book is not for those who do not already know Java. This book suffers from a lack of concise explanations of concepts. It also jumps from basic concepts to more complex ones with almost no transition. Therefore anyone who fails to comprehend earlier concepts (a distinct possibility due to poor explanations) will be at a total loss for later, more important concepts. I urge any teacher who desires a book that aids the learning of Java (or computer science in general) to forego this book and search for one of higher caliber."
2,Not written for someone who does not know Java already!,"I thought that I had some computer smarts after 17 years of experience in that field, then I took a class using this book. The class started with 30 students and there is about 15 left, and most of us are ready to walk out. This book does not reinforce what it is teaching. It adds features within a chapter that they never explain. The exercies are filled with problems that they have never given an example of how to solve.This book could not even be used for a door stop!"
5,Awesome Book,Lots of photos and information in this book. Good techniques for rubber stamping. Im very happy with this book. I'd like to see more books like this one.
5,I love the book!,"The book was perfect, the price was unbelievably low and the book arrived within the time frame or before that was promised!The book presented some instructions for making greeting cards that I had never seen before. I love it!"
5,An Original Tale of Love Conquers All ... with a Modern Twist,"Everything about this book amazed me. The story of a forbidden love which is not only interspecial but lesbian. The characters, the beneficent Witch, the feisty Renarda, the shy Lapine, the clever (albeit idiosyncratic) Albertus, and the conservative Owl. The idea of a central authority of exiling two of their own citizens, simply because of their difference, and the two exiles still manage to find each other. The satisfying ending which entails the central authority being ruled out by a more reasonable authority. An instant classic."
4,Candles,These cd's have a lot of great old songs on them really enjoy lissening to them. Thank you Beryl DuRietz
2,Candles in the Rain/Leftover Wine,"This is a two CD set. CD 1 was of poor quality with very low level sound. Had to turn CD player volume up to 20 to hear enjoyably. Actually it would not even "" read"" (play) in one of my vehicles. CD 2 was much better. Kept volume level at 12, which is my normal. Sound was clearer too. I didn't try CD 2 in the other vehicle. CD 1 will get no use. #2 is enjoyable. I would not recommend this album."
5,Melanie from the 70's,"I enjoyed hearing that Melanie is still producing, and she still sounds great after so many years! It makes my day to listen to her music."
5,Great Buy!,I have been searching for this tea for years after receiving a sampler for Christmas and finally found it! It is a great assortment with many amazing flavors. My personal favorite is the ginger peach tea. It is a great gift for anyone that loves tea or even a great way to indulge yourself!
3,Tea Review,The teas are a Christmas tradation in our family. They were excellent. Favors were unique and freshness very good.
2,this book is made for 8th graders!,"i'm sure an 8th grader has mastered this book! very simple terms, good for people that absolutely knows nothing about computers. otherwise, i needed this book for college - that's it."
2,A disservice to an interesting guy,"Many events that were essential in the shaping of mormonism and Smith's life are left out of this history.For some reason the editor didn't mention what was the content of the Nauvoo Expositor, or why it was so dangerous for Smith. Polygamy was also not addressed in any detail.Smith comes off as an unreal man who always had the misfortune of being victimized by ""bad"" people.Has history ever been this simple? Strange."
2,Bummer,"Ok...this was a real bummer for me. The reproduction is terrible. The line art looks...well, I can only describe it as pixelated. Like the they were working from some low-res digital photos of the original comics as the source material for the book. Still, I was in the mood to be forgiving. It was only when I compared this edition to an earlier Marvel reprint of Marvel Comics #1 published in 1990 (ISBN 0-87134-729-1) that I got totally bummed. The 1990 edition is really nice. The lines are clean, the color is clean. It's like the total opposite of this. If you're looking for clean reproduction and can live with a reprint of only one issue, search out that edition.That stated, the stories are great. These early Sub Mariner stories are incredible, the Human Torch is totally bizarre, the Angel, Ka-Zar--almost surreal. Still, if it were a $15.00 paperback, that'd be one thing. As a $30+ hardcover, I'd say check it out from the library."
1,A really lousy company to deal with,"I bought this lock in November after our second trailer had been stolen (they cut thru the padlocks). At that time our trailer was buried in snow and ice and we couldnt see the wheels much less put this lock on a wheel. We got a melt in early March, I handed it to my husband to put it on the trailer and he came back in and said ""where are the keys?"" There were no keys to this thing. I would expect the keys would have been taped to the lock but they werent. I contacted the company with several emails to get a set of keys but they NEVER RESPONDED. So all we got is a very expensive door stop. PFFFFFFT. Lousy company who deserves to go belly up in this economy because they dont care about their customer."
1,item faulty,"i bought this item and within the first week the lock broke, i had to weld the piece back on"
4,Nano ipod leather case,"This was great value for money.I was expecting some tacky ""leatherette"" case, but this was the real deal, really well made and fits my Nano perfectly.Totally recommended."
3,Camcorder Adapter,"Unfortunately, I am unable to rate this product because the camera i bought it for is not working. I thought it was the battery or the charger, but it turns out to be something internal."
2,Not Much Help,"I am an actual homeschooling kid in junior high, and of course, I want to make sure I get into a good college. I bought this book thinking that it would help, but it doesn't. A lot of the book isn't even about college - it's about alternatives to college. I also noticed that the author repeated the same information a lot, so the book really isn't as long as it seems. The people in the book who gave comments were generally Christian homeschoolers from southern states, and many of their children didn't even go on to college. If they did, it was generally only to community college. There were very few comments made by representatives of colleges. When they did make comments, they were very brief, and the colleges, like the homeschoolers, seemed to be southern and Christian. This book isn't very helpful at all, in my opinion. I think that most homeschoolers would be better off using different books to plan for college."
5,Nausicaa of the Valley of Wind : Perfect Collection (Vol 4),Miyazaki is a GOD!!! he is brillant. This is the only true graphic novel ive ever read. Praise to miyazaki-- this is a must have for any anime or comic fan ^_^
2,slightly dissapointed,"This is actually one product I'm a bit disappointed in. Being an owner of other fluke products, mostly multimeters and such, I was surprised by the quality of the TS25D, while it functions as advertised and has some nice features it just doesn't feel like typical fluke quality. For instance when sliding the mode switch the speaker crackles, which to me indicates that a cheap switch was used (and it does feel that way too), not a big deal but it makes you wonder if there's anything else the skimped on."
4,Soundtrack is available!!!,I just wanted to let everyone know that the soundtrack is available [on the internet]. Lot's of dark visceral pleasure to be had.
4,Understanding a Need for truth,"This is one of the books that President George W. Bush said helped him to understand the newed to substitute a culture of responsibility for the false ideas of liberation that grew out of the l960's counter culture. The author explains how liberal ideological constructs concerning work, mental illness, and education produced awful consequences for the poor. They did for the rich as well, but a wealthy single mother had far more options, he says, than her counterpart. Magnet skewers warm fictions about homelessness leading to crime, noting that criminal behavior usually comes first."
5,"In the dreams of ""liberals,"" the Devil appears benevolent","Dr. Magnet's work is among the most important I have encountered. Now that time has verified his dream-analysis, the only defense left to the chiliad social-reformer utopians is that their Dreams have been misunderstood, and the problem is, in their lack of success, el Nino. Magnet presents a beautifully integrated and comprehensive analysis of what the degenerative idea of radical egalitarianism produces. Dragon's Teeth were sown, and Magnet points out the resultant weeds.If you have pondered what it is that brings about the destruction of Mankind's visionary, social-political fancies, Dr. Magnet will enlighten.Also, one might consider another excellent work that affirms Magnet's: The Character of Nations, by Prof. Angelo Codevilla.Frank MaguireFairview, OREGON"
1,Worst book ever!,"Illogical, conservative and contains contradictions within itself. Every page is drenched with hate and ignorance. This is a way too simplistic explanation of how the economy and humans work.Nevertheless, if you know some white supremacist who needs a good read; here is the perfect present."
5,Why The World Is The Way It Is,"I read the original edition of this book and it is still the most important social commentary I've ever read. For those who have ever asked, ""Why is the world the way it is today?"", this book will explain it.Magnet traces all of our current social problems- from crime to drug addiction, broken families to pregnant teenagers to school violence - to the liberal social experimentation of the Sixties and early Seventies, using pure a priori logic, not demagoguery.Additionally he shows how those once radical ideas have become our mainstream, unquestioned assumptions, the very Establishment itself; conservatives are now the radicals shaking up the system.Enormously enlightening for anyone who really wants to understand our current social predicaments."
3,"interesting, if not a little disjointed","While I'm normally a fan of W.P. Kinsella, I found this book to be very disjointed. Its important for potential readers to know that the book is built around various short stories that Kinsella has written at various times. The central story itself is an expansion of an earlier short story, ""The Dixon Cornbelt League"". While I found the central story fascinating, the whole experience of the book suffered because entire chapters are devoted to old short stories that have nothing to do with the central plot of the novel. While I recommend this book, I think potential readers should beware that instead of getting an independent novel, you're getting a group of repackaged short stories."
5,Pleasantly surprised!,"This is the first book I have read by W.P. Kinsella, although I know the story of Shoeless Joe, and have seen 'Field of Dreams'. I really enjoyed this book - read it in 2 days! I loved the mystery/twist to the story."
3,Art Nouveau Jewelry Desgins,The book is full of great jewelery designs but they are only basic monotone colour drawings and not photos or varied coloured drawings.
2,"Ok, but not as good as I'd hoped","The search engine is a HUGE negative. Results are not reproducable consistently, so if you see an image you might like at some point in the future, you better save it because the chances you'll find it again are slim. Simple searches will turn up 10s of thousands of results, many having nothing to do with the search term.I was wildly frustrated trying to find, and refind images.When you can find what you're looking for, they're useful, and I didn't have any trouble with taking them to press in high resolution. They are very heavy on only happy people - if you want to find a slightly sad or impoverished-looking individual you won't find them. (Or maybe you will, but I sure can't.)If they can manage to upgrade the search - or even produce some kind of thumbnail set that people could view or print easily - I would recommend it more highly. As it is, it approaches adequate."
3,Good but like dancing in cement boots,"Images if you manage to find what you want are very workable for graphics, but sheesh could they come up with a more cumbersome system? It takes up a lot of MBs on the computer, the search engine is laughable. If you manager to find what you are looking for, save it quick, for you won't likely come back to that image again.Sorry, this needs a lot of work to make it a worthwhile buy."
3,Same book as The Hay Poisoner!,This book is also available as The Hay Poisoner: Herbert R. Armstrong by Martin Beales. It is the exact same book published under a different title.
2,Only O.K.,"I had high hopes for the Lansky Easy Grip but it's engineering got in the way of that. The angle of the carbides is such that 80% of the knives I've tried it on, the metal that is being removed is well above the knives actually cutting edge. Great idea, but in practice, not very worthwhile. Sorry Lansky!"
2,Scent,Scent is not very much like chocolate hazelnut. Expected it to smell like Nutella... it doesn't.
4,"extensively illustrated, little in way of grammer, etc.,","this book is almost all illustrations. Contains a short summary explaining grammar, though not in -depth. Good sign list, also shows how to draw glyphs. Might be good as a reference, but for serious student it will not stand alone."
4,good word vocabulary,This book does not really teach you how to read and write heiroglyphs very well but it does show many words and how they were used on tombs and ancient manuscripts. This book is probably not the best book for someone who is a beginner and trying to learn how to learn hieroglyphs.
4,Egyptian Hieroglyphics: How to Read and Write them,"This is an excellent text for upper grade elementry school (4th through 6th grade) who might be preparing their classes for a trip to a local museum, or perhaps, for an artist/craftsperson who wants to design a cartouche. Also, any Boy Scouts / Girl Scouts working on their archeology merit badges might find it useful."
5,Great Set of Super Why Episodes,"My daughter loves Super Why, and she has learned so much from watching them. The only thing I don't like about this set of episodes is that the Tooth Fairy sings in a ""racy"" voice, but I'm not so much a prude that I don't let my daughter watch it or anything; it's just a different style of music than we're used to."
4,They Will Help,"These tapes will help you pass the A+ exam. But be aware that there is some wrong information on the tapes. An example is the Dos boot sequence. So don't make this your only guide. The ""Dummies"" book is good except for the Dos section,and the original Exam Cram book can be very helpful."
1,"if you have other Word World dvds, don't buy this one!",My kids and I LOVED all the Word World dvds. So I pre-ordered this dvd as soon as it was available. What a disappointment! Only one new episode!! This dvd was a waste of money. Save your money and don't order this dvd if you already have other Word World dvds.
3,"It works, but HUSH....","It is a powerful vacuum, can pick up everything stuck in the carpet. You can see the dirt accumulated in the dust chamber. really powerful. The HUSH mode does not work for me. I indeed released the boost switch. The HUSH mode is just slightly quieter than normal, almost the same. Any other magic botton?"
1,Terrible,"I got this vacuum after using a friends and loving it. For about a month it worked great, then it lost suction. After every use (3 to 4 times a week) I had to flip it over and cut the pet hair and lint off the bristles or it would pick nothing up at the next use. Yesterday I vacuumed, then I brought into the store to see if it could be fixed under my store bought service plan (still waiting to hear back about that) and purchased a different brand vacuum because I was so frustrated with this one. When I got my new vacuum home I used it and got 3 containers of dirt, hair, things that weren't visable to the eye but ground into my carpet because the hoover didn't pick it up. It made me sick to know all that was on my floor and my kids were playing on it."
3,bad wheels,"The vacuum performed great but the wheels fell off and couldn't not be repaired by the repair shop. They claimed the part was unavailable. I had to buy a new vacuum after about 7 months! I just bought a new one, same brand and model because I was so happy with the suction and thought it to be a fluke. The wheels are trying to break off the new one now after about 6 months! I can't believe Hoover would put such cheap wheels on this thing."
1,Don't buy a bagless vacuum,Don't buy a bagless vacuum!!! I thought it was a great idea until I had to clean the vacuum every time it is used otherwise the suction is terrible. I spend time cleaning up the dirt and then I have to handle the dirt (with rubber gloves) and then spend time washing the parts -- not the hepa filter -- which is made of paper on my model -- I long for the days when I could toss the paper bag in the trash and be back up and running in 3 minutes.
4,This vac sucks dirt.,"I was impressed with the amount of dirt the vac picks up. It has a clear cannister where you can see the dirt. For the money, not a bad liitle vac."
3,"LOUD when it is in ""hush"" mode, LOUDER when it is not","This is a good vacuum in terms of efficient clearning and suction. The noise on carpets is bareable, but the jet-engine roar on hardwood floors is not. The ""hush"" button works (other reviewers are mistaken on this point) but it does so by reducing power. The overall noise level may well be close to ""toxic sound"" (the point at which prolonged exposure will cause damage to hearing) and I use it with ear plugs. Many other vacuums have similar problems, however, and if you can tolerate it this one is a good value from the perspective of price."
1,Too OUT THERE,"If you're hoping this is another dose of good ol' North Mississippi Allstars' bluesy jam-rock jamming away with a guest keyboardist, then let me fill you in--AVOID THIS CD. If you like music that sounds like R2D2 on an acid trip, then this CD is for you. The first track is OK, but it steadily downspirals into something incomprehensible--BORING, at that. There is a viable market for music like this, and I don't mean to knock other people's musical tastes, but for me this CD is useless. I'll stick to NMA's regular catalog, thank you."
1,BOOOOOOOOOOORING,"suckswhat do they do?most of it is weak bass and they make absolutely NO sense.They have no twists with their songs, they are wannabes and their music has almost no beat, and the song trendsetter is stupid and repetitive. This is something you could only listen to if you are stoned"
1,CANNOT BELIEVE THEY GOT A RECORD DEAL,what is thisall the songs are all beat and they CANNOT rap and its totally LOW BUDGET and NONE of these guys have any talent and are a bunch of washed up crackheads singing about nothing and TRYING to act like a bunch of gangstas but de aint
4,"I like it, but the sounds are not what I expected.","I love the clock, but I expected better disney sounds. I like the harp to wake up to, but the giggling and such is not what I expected. Though the radio, clock, etc. is great high quality. I love the big snooze button."
3,The best of the Viking Trilogy,"This was enjoyable reading but enough with the stories already! I found myself skipping over the stories that Laren told because they simply were not interesting. But the hero, Merrick, had a good heart, and it made the book very worthwile."
2,Objects viewed may appear larger then they are...,"Don't be fooled by the picture. This necklace is barely larger then the matching earrings. The picture leads you to believe it is much larger when, in fact, it is dwarfed by your pinky finger. There should be something added to the picture to better show the actual size. Maybe a postage stamp."
4,PSD Still The best Live Show,"On a whim or chance did I even find a copy of this CD now living far away from the Western Mass of my youth. Some of my greatest Memories were seeing PSD play Live and as then, I wonder why this band never went much past that music filled area. The live stuff on the CD, is as good as I remember, new recordings are a little less impressive, but worth the listen. I comend PSD for continueing the play, and recomend this ""blast from the past"" to any who remember, and any who love great 80's style fun-punk, Western Mass Hardcore."
5,I love this book its the best,I love this book because it has lots of adventures and lots of spooky stuuf. All of the three witches have a power one witch has the power to freeze the time one witch has the moving power and the last one has the power to see the fucher. So if you like witches this is defenatly the book for you.Read and enjoy.
5,A must for Charmed Fans,This book is definitely one of my favorite Charmed Books. Without giving too much away.. I found the book to be more entertaining then mysterious. It was great how Phoebe found a ingenious way to contact her sisters. Rosalind Noonan is a great author!
5,bookworm mistress says:,"this is a great story. it is funny and full of action. i especially like the part about pheobe's red nail polish while she is in Massachusis, Salem way back in the past....yea neway. its funny and it will have you readin to the early hours of the morning coz u jus cant put it down!!!!!!!!!!!just read the darn book OK?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?"
1,Buyer Beware!,"This is NOT The Weaklings. They maybe some weaklings, but not the punk rock outlaws from Portland, OR. The music here's ok I guess. It's just too bad they didn't check to see if there was a band using the name. (3 years earlier!)"
5,A Must-See for Everyone!,"Every child should see this in school. Especially children in poor neighborhoods. Every parent should see it. Every person on the planet should be able to see and know about how the planet works. This presentation is well written, well thought out, and well said and illustrated. It's as good as ""Planet Earth"" series. It covers at least three subjects that should be taught in our schools at the elementary school level. And it does this in an enjoyable format."
4,Give Planet Earth Its Unappreciated Due in Co-Modeling Human Destiny,"Geologist and senior lecturer Iain Stewart does a phenomenal job in explaining clearly to a broad audience how much influence climate, geography, and geology have had on the destiny of humanity. Too often, human beings do not acknowledge how much they owe to Planet Earth.Stewart successively reviews the impact of deep earth, fire, water, and wind on what humanity has accomplished. Stewart also looks at the comprehensive influence that men and women have had on shaping the environment around them. Teachers can use the two-DVD set under review to help make geography and history appealing to their secondary school students.In summary, the BBC once more shines in combining a gifted educator, fascinating narrative, outstanding camerawork, and appropriate special effects with each other to explain complex phenomena to a broad audience."
4,All about the Earth,"I teach high school science, and I am constantly looking for videos that have academic value for classes to look at when there are schedule irregularities or for when I am absent. This is a beautifully crafted video, full of information that students will find interesting and presented in a visually fascinating format. I will have students view the film and take notes. They then submit an abstract or review of the film which summarizes the facts that they learned and evaluating the presentation. I look forward to using this in my class."
1,False advertising,"I bought this because it was stated to be a sugar free low caffeine drink. The item I received exactly matches the picture, but the nutrition information does not match that given on Amazon. Most importantly, while it is sugar-free, the 99.8% caffeine free / 2mg of caffeine claims are completely wrong. The nutrition label on the product says it has 65mg of caffeine per serving, almost as much as the 80mg in a can of Red Bull. I can't comment on the taste as I will be returning this."
2,Gross!,"I love Big Train Chai but this stuff is nasty. When they say ""no sugar added"" be aware that there is SPLENDA added. I hate splenda so I now have a ton of packets of nasty chai tea. So sad."
4,Excellent Brazilian Miniseries,"This is a shortened version of the original miniseries that they showed on Rede Globo. There are 5 discs total. The entire series is in Portuguese. Unfortunately, there isn't an option to get Spanish/English audio or subtitles.The series is itself is full of passion, romance, suspense, and drama. You'll instantly fall in love with the characters and learn a lot about Brazil's history. I thoroughly enjoyed it and the only reason I rated it 4 stars instead of 5 is because it does not contain a Spanish/English option for subtitles or audio.I would love to own the original ""full length"" series but this is a great buy for whomever wants to relive the most epic moments in this wonderful masterpiece.It does contain a small ""behind-the-scenes"" look (in Portuguese) in which the producers and actors are interviewed. This lasts approximantely 30 minutes. Another featurette allows the viewer to see all of the battles in one segment."
2,Only for small jobs,"I have what is essentially the same saw purchased several years ago from that big orange money-sucking store. This is NOT a commercial-grade tool. It's light and easily transported, but not terribly powerful. It's okay in soft stone like slate, but a little slow. The fence on it is somewhat hard to move and adjust. Cutting through granite or quarts may result in tripping the internal breaker repeatedly. I began as a DIY homeowner and am now a professional remodeler and have need of a wet saw fairly often. As my the number of projects requiring a wet saw has increased, I've found it necessary to upgrade to a beefier saw. But, if you don't need one for regular professional work, this is a handy little unit."
2,DOES NOT FIT IN THE LANSINOH DOUBLE ELECTRIC PUMP!!,"I bought these bottles at the same time that I bought the Lansinoh Double Electric Breast Pump (which I love!) thinking that I would use them the same way I used the Ameda bottles that I got from the hospital. However, these bottles are too wide on the bottom and do not fit into the two holders on the pump. They may fit into other pumps, but not the Lansinoh one. You can still use them to express milk, but you will have to set them on the table when you're done instead of the more secure holders on the pump. I will not be taking any of these bottles with me when I go back to work and pump as I can't risk one tipping over and spilling."
4,Great bottles,"These bottles are great for pumping & storing. The removable disk in the cap is made of rubber, so there's a good seal, and you can take it out to put a nipple in. The shape is great because they're bigger at the base so stand up nicely.I have a medela freestyle pump that I'm using them with. They do fit, although if you bump the bottle, it can pop off, even when screwed on. The screw joints do not match tightly like Medela bottles. BUT, you can get 8 of these for the price of 3 Medela bottles, so they're a great buy. I'll use them when I pump at home and take the Medela bottles for pumping on the go."
1,Strong chemical Smell,"I bought these bottles for storing pumped breast milk (which is what they are intended for) and they have a strong chemical smell. I followed the directions on the box and boiled the parts for 5 minutes before use. I then washed them and rinsed them thoroughly. No matter how many times I wash them, the chemical smell does NOT go away. I will not be using these to store milk. If I can smell chemicals I don't think it is safe for the storage of milk which will be consumed by my 2 month old baby!"
1,These bags leak when defrosted!,"These bags leak! I've used about 10 bags so far, and 7 of them leaked out milk when they were defrosting! :( Please take my advice and get something else instead. Your milk is too valuable to take chances with leaky bags."
4,Good learning tool,"I had taken a Spanish class and this was the book we used. Between the book and the CD's, learning was easy. I was surprised at how much I learned in a 10 week course."
4,A Good Start,This book is a good start to learning Spanish... the kind of Spanish you need to know to get around. It's also very enjoyable to read.
3,Neutral comments,"I am in the third week of an eight-week course, using these materials in an adult-ed course, of which I am instructor. I tend to agree with the comments of stb of NY. A large problem I have up to this point is assigning pages in the text to tracks on the CDs. There is only a haphazard and partial correlation between pages and tracks, and students wanting to practice what they have read about, or viceversa, must search through the book to find the material treated on a particular track, or must listen through random tracks on the three CDs in an attempt to find material they have read about. Titles of sections in the book don't help this process, either, since they often don't match track titles."
4,Comprehensive and Useful,"I read ""Cognitive Science An Introduction to the Study of Mind"" not for a course requirement, but because I was interested in the topic. The book provided a comprehensive and readable account of this new field. It explained ideas in a way that I could follow, not having had any specialized training in the different areas. The figures effectively broke up the text and helped to explain and expand upon concepts introduced in the chapters. The exercises and web links at the chapter endings invite to reiterate and explore topics in greater detail. There was also a web site with practice exams and electronic flash cards. I can see that it would be useful for an undergraduate if assigned for a course."
4,WOW!,This movie was so well done and scripted. I really enjoyed the plot and the charters of this film. It was really uplifting and a real eye opener. I would recommend anyone seeing The Help.
5,Great movie,"A great movie and a real portrayal of life in the 50s and 60s. According to those that read the book, it follows extremely well."
5,If you read 1 book this year - Read this one!,"One of the best books ever written....Glad the author stuck with this story until it finally got published!!!! Inspiring, and makes you want to be a better person."
5,GREAT MOVIE,I SAW THIS IN THE MOVIE THEATRE AND DECIDED IT WAS A KEEPER SO I WANTED IT FOR MY COLLECTION. WE HAVE WATCHED IT NUMEROUS TIMES AND WILL CONSIDER IT A CLASSIC.
3,the help,"The movie was a sad disappointment after having read the book--as most movies-from-books are. Amazon's service was exemplary, as always."
5,Wow! def better than I thought.,"When I saw this movie at the theatre, I thought it was very good. But when I got the DVD & seen it again, it was even better the second time. Viola Davis does an incredible & superb job. I really hope she receives the Oscar for best actress."
3,"""I AM THE HELP""","I really enjoyed reading the book more. The movie, the actresses, all good. I'm just more of a reader. To view it, put it right in your face!!!!! Racism is hard to deal with."
4,"Pretty good, not great","This is an interesting and often heartbreaking, even sometimes humorous, story of a woman who wants to tell the story of what it's like for the black maids in Mississippi, 1963, to work for spoiled white folks in a segregated town, just as the civil rights movement is starting to gain momentum. Total Oscar-bait, from the performances to the soundtrack to the production design. That's fine; it's just rather obvious.Kudos to the cast for making the characters so believable, from the hateful Hilly to the sympathetic maids."
5,The Help,"The DVD, The Help, arrived in excellent condition and in a timely manner. I enjoyed watching the movie and have shared it with others here at home since receiving it."
2,The book was so much better.,"We thought that the movie was slow and the direction sloppy. On the other hand, the book was much deeper and more complete. I would skip the movie and read the book, or get it as an audiobook and listen to it. I do recommend the story, but not the on-screen version."
4,The book was carried by the topic,The story was captivating as much by the topic as by the telling. The author kept my attention to the end.
1,The help,Bought movie The Help used movie was told excellent condition I didn't watch same day anyway movie messed up bad everything skipping around and freeze up awful never again
1,Uses Lord's name in vain,I find it really bizarre that the directors found it necessary to use the GD word or any profanity for that matter in what would be such a great movie without such language.
1,The Help,"I don't usually like a movie as much as the book, but ""The Help"" did not disappoint. The acting was superb - especially Viola Davis and Octavia Spencer. They both deserve the Academy Award and I thought that the moment I first saw the movie. I'm keeping my fingers crossed that they both receive this award on Sunday. I also loved the clothes - took me back to the 60s when we dressed that way! An excellent movie - deserves all the accolades it will surely receive on the 26th of February."
4,Very good movie.,"Very good movie. I would recommend it. Glad I just got it on DVD verses BluRay- there were no special effects, etc to justify getting it on BluRay. And the movie was good enough that it did not need to be enhanced by BluRay. Shipping was a bit slow on it- ordered 12/31/11, and just received it on 1/7/12."
1,Race-bashing,"Gee. This show makes it look like negroes love fried chicken! Outrageous stereotyping!How is it that reverse racism beats straight out racism?!Race bashing. Revenge? Wow.There is the token ""cool"" white person though.Honestly, ""Mississippi Burning"" is a viable movie about racism in the past. Strong, unlike The Help, which is so repulsive and weak. Liberal Hypocrites enticing one another into self-righteous indignation."
1,poor,"This DVD was scratched really bad. Movie would pause a lot due to all the scratches, couldn't even enjoy it."
5,Outstanding!!,"This is one of the best books I have ever seen. I have seen the movie also. I couldn't put it down, it was a wonderful read and really gives you insight on what these women went thru."
2,Lacking punch,"Not as good as the book, too much left out. The book was raw and gritty, the movie was sugar coated."
1,Had Potential,"The movie had potential BUT the language was very offensive - Cursing, Using God Name in Vain. It deserves the trash can (because of the language that's where I put it)."
5,The Help Movie,This movie is as awesome as the book! I highly recommend reading the book and getting the movie!! Excellent cast! I love Addie and Minny!! All of them!!
5,WOW what a wonderful movie,"I did not know what to expect from this movie - (I had not read the book) But, was intrigued enough to watch--- Soooooo glad I did. This is a very good movie, well written - well produced - well casted & directed - Just a great movie-"
5,The Help,I thought this movie was very good.It showed the side of what the black servants went through.It was very well put together.I would recommend this movie to everyone.
3,Help,"I love the movie. But I dont believe that the item arrived as described. They described is as ""very good"". Its pretty scratched up. That to me is ""used"" or ""acceptable"". I sent back prior feedback but I didnt get any kind of response. It does play"
5,"love,love,love it!","love the movie, but book was better! Still a great purchase and will recommend reading the book before watching the movie"
5,Enjoyed this movie,This was an interesting movie. I was amused at the antics and suprised that it depicted some of the characters the way it really was in the south. I enjoyed the movie.
4,"Love ""The Help""",This is a great movie! The quality of the blu-ray disc was just ok. I have a 4 month old LG player and it had a couple of jump starts reading it. Eventually I did get it to play.
4,The Help is excellent,"This movie is fascinating and a powerful look at our mid-20th century culture. Seeing the events unfold tells us much about the world we've inheirited. As one who grew up in the western United States, but moved as an adult to the South, I learned so much about racial relationships from watching this. I also get an education into the nature of southern women and how they are formed and (sometimes mal-formed)."
4,too fluffy,"The movie does a Hallmark number on the story line of the book, prettying things up, making them glossy, removing some intense and important events. Two of these I feel are critical and I can't imagine why they were left out. Their inclusion would have done a much better job of conveying the horror and dangers of living under forced segregation. The acting was good, and carries what might otherwise have fallen flat. It isn't a bad movie, but treats the subject matter more superficially and lightheartedly than the book."
5,Excellent Movie,This is a movie I enjoyed from start to end. The story was very interesting and the acting and directing was very good. I would recommend the movie to anyone. The story followed the book very well. The movie is an eye opener.
5,Cast wonderful,All members of the cast true to the way I saw them when I read the book. Viola Davis best actress.
5,Gift,"This was a gift, It was just what the person wanted. I've had no complaints and they seemed very content. Delivery was quick and even received a video credit as a bonus.BM"
5,Excellent,"The movie was excellent. Acting was terrific. It was refreshing to enjoy a movie. Unfortunately, that can't be said of most movies nowadays."
1,Color is messed up,The color is wrong everything is in red ! i got this for my grandamas bday and im sad :(
2,Fantasy Land,"This was a great idea ruined. It's a serious subject Hollywooded up to be easily digestable... just like the infamous pie. (Why tricking someone into eating sh!t is supposed to be funny or ""great revenge"" is beyond me. It's criminal! I don't care how awful the target is.)All the white women are skinny and ditsy. All the blacks are wise and noble (even when serving their own sh!t). The men are scenery. Where are the illiterate maids who can't tell their stories much less write them down? Where are the smart, intelligent women, who nevertheless give their kids to black women they don't respect to raise? No mention of sexual harassment. Indeed.... did anyone involved in this project ever have a maid?A serious subject that deserves some scrutiny.... Hollywooded up to be trite, nostalgic, and acceptable to whites."
1,A Dark Comedy,"The Help was incredibly predictable and consequently boring. Most importantly The Help made light of very serious subjects and seemed more like dark comedy than drama. The main character's boyfriend was completely unbelievable in his mood swings. At dinner he is an arrogant alcoholic. Upon visiting her home he is a supportive, apologetic man. Upon news of the publication, he becomes an enraged man who leaves in a fury! His character was completely unbelievable. The actresses were great, but other than their skilled acting, I feel I wasted a couple of hours and was embarrassed that I selected the movie for viewing."
2,My 1st screw up,I got this and it skipped not sure what i am missing in the movie guess i should've bought it at the store instead
2,"Read the book, avoid the movie","Though in the minority, for anyone raised in the south who remembers what it was--the book was a fascinatingly told tale. The movie, pure Hollywood--with lousy accents and helmet hair on the wrong characters. If you are on an airplane, without the book--well, choose wisely. Otherwise, download the book first and enjoy the original source material."
3,Not bad,Quite a nice little movie about civil rights. More laughs were had than expected. Good thing it wasn't too serious.
1,THE LIE,"This movie is terribly awful. In essence this movie says that Dr. Martin Luther King, Medgar Evers, Rosa Parks, Nat Turner, Malcolm X and all other pioneers and catalyst for freedom of black and civil rights movement are liars and never did existed. As always blacks are being portrayed as not being able to help themselves and require the assistance of whites to do for them.This movie is the WHITE LIE and it is only popular and praised to the heavens because it makes whites look good and feel better about themselves. It is completely unrealistic. This movie is an insult to the black race.I give it one star because I have to.There are many movies and documentaries about the true heroes of the fight for freedom for blacks and the civil rights movement and I have never seen them praised like this sorry movie. And it is because the documentaries and movies that tell the truth are not liked by white mainstream."

5,The Help,The Help was an awesome movie. Very much worth the money. It was well thought out and funny while yet teaching lessons to the viewers.
3,Poor Second,"I had Just finished the Book so, the movie was a poor second.I know they say "" the book is always better"" But, i really felt the movie was rushed."
5,Grew Movie,All of the females in my family loved this movie. I will not give out any details that could spoil the plot.
5,The Help,"The Help was so true to what I had seen in Tyler Texas as a boy. It was well told and true to the time. The intrege of the story was what I would have expected and was great. The filming, and screen play were excellant. If one did not live during that time one might think it was not a true example of what was normal at the time. Very easy reading and entertaining."
