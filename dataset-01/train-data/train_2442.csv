2,wHAT IF BY KATE WINSLET,THIS RECORDING IS VERY MOVING AND IS SUNG WITH GREAT FEELING. THE RECORD CAUSES ONE TO RECALL ALL THE WHAT IFS IN THEIR LIFE.
5,Hot actress Excellent Vocie!,"Kate Winslet is good looking but can also sing. This CD has two versions of the song and a track frot the movie A Christmas Carol and her Music video for ""what if"". I never knew this actress could sing so good!"
5,Kate's Beautiful Singing Voice!,"I first listened to this song the other day while looking up the little song that Kate Winslet had sung in ""Heavenly Creatures."" I have to say that Winslet is a multitalented person! This has to be the best song I have heard in a long time! I wish she would make at least one cd b/c she's soooo good! If you haven't heard this you have to get it! It's wonderful!"
3,2.5 mm x 5.5 mm plug for AC Adapter,It was a little difficult fitting this plug into the ac adapter; it was snug and did not go all the way into the adapter.
4,A necessary response to dogmatic Young Earth Creationism,"Mark Whorton started with a personnel example of how hurtful and offensive ""Young Earth Creationism"" (YEC) dogmatism can be and then provides example after example why this dogmatic view is inconsistent with Scripture.Dr. Whorton shows that one of the YEC's dominate tenets, mainly that God created a prefect universe that remained ""prefect"" until the fall of Adam, is both systematically inconsistent and Biblically not required. Dr. Whorton then provided a better alternative and more consistent reading of scripture that does not contradict our understanding of the creation, neither Biblical nor scientific.I recommend ""Peril in Paradise: Theology, Science, and the Age of the Earth"" to anyone interested in the Biblical Creation debate. NOTE: The scope of the book, in my opinion, is set for the advanced student, layman, or scholar."
5,so much more than beans,This cookbook has been sitting on my kitchen table for weeks now and I keep finding something new every day. This is so much more than beans! best Red Thai curry I've made ..our friday night pizza was made with chickpea flour from this book and was incredible. Aliza you are incredible..love thumbing page to page for inspiration..love you and all your cookbooks xxoo
1,Assumes you have the entire day to cook,"This cook book is not designed for a busy, active person. The author dismisses the use of canned beans. Every recipe requires that you begin by soaking and cooking dried beans (an 8 hour process). It also assumes that you have access to specialized cooking equipment, like earthenware pots and paella pans. The one recipe that I made completely from scratch (including carmelizing garlic and fire roasting tomatoes) was definitely NOT worth the effort - it just wasn't that good. While I really like to cook, I don't have the time that this cook book demands."
4,Wendell Berry is a truly great writer.,"Wendell Berry is a truly great writer. He tells a simple story : how a young boy's life changes forever because of his favorite uncle's sudden death, and more importantly, how one event can shape the remainder of a person's life. In these days of relentless, horrific tragedies which are never fully assimilated or understood, Berry sets a timeless stage in the small town of Port William, Kentucky, where the same events are felt for generations. In his books there is all the time in the world, to feel, to adjust, to accept. He uses just the right words and not too many of them. His language has a clarity and spaciousness that leaves a reader deeply refreshed. I would highly recommend his book of short stories, ""Fidelity"" ( and that story in particular). As in the best classics of literature, the reader is transported to another world and comes away a better person for it."
5,Another beautiful reflection on family from Berry,"I ordered this book for a book club, in part because it was one of Berry's shorter novels and easier to read in time for the date of our book club meeting. I LOVED this book. Berry writes so beautifully and so honestly about family, marriage, and fatherhood. He is one of my favorite authors and an excellent choice both for independent reading and group studies. Highly recommended!"
5,So convenient,"Buying these in this pack, instead of one-by-one at the drugstore counter is not only more convenient, but less expensive. I didn't know they were available online until I chanced to look them up at Amazon. What a find."
4,Works as advertised,These pads definitely beat applying drops of medicine as in years past. The only thing that I wish is that the pads came in smaller sizes.
1,Horrible!,"I tried these quite a few time and each time these pads gave me blisters within 12 hrs of being on my wart. I was so disappointed because I heard they work great and I read all the reviews, but not on me. I wasted all this money and I can't even return them!! Not a happy customer!"
1,horrible product,This product does not work at all ! It never got rid of my son's Plantars Wart. Much better product is Trans-ver-sal. Do not buy Curad Mediplast
4,Good Product,"Product works very well, have tried many other treatments for plantar warts with no luck, until I tried this product."
3,Harley on the T-shirt,"For you Indian Motorcycle acciciondos, it is a just another Harley on the t-shirt, not an Indian Motorcycle like you were looking for. A 1946 Indian Chief Roadmaster (note the year it's important) would be ideal with the background logo."
2,indian biker shirt,i ordered this shirt and it came on time the problem is that this shirt is made so poorly that after 1 wash it is already starting come apart the lettering on the front is peeling off. it is very low quality and i would not recommend buying from this company
1,What Measurement Standard?,"You certainly don't want to buy this socket set not knowing if its Metric, American or Whitworth, would you?"
1,Terrible,"As someone had written before, the lid won't stay on (and we don't have a dishwasher!) In addition, the label on inside bottom was almost impossible to remove.But the lid was the main problem. We went to our neighborhood Winn Dixie Store and found one which was much more economical, and works much better."
5,Ethan Freeman: With You,Track Listing:1. With You2. The Impossible Dream3. Pilate's Dream4. If I Can't Love Her5. I Talk to the Trees6. Bui Doi7. The Music of the Night8. Lonely Town9. Anthem10. Bring Him Home11. There but for You Go I12. Morning Glow
3,madness,"The songs One Step Beyond,House of Fun,Our House and It Must be Love . I like very much the rest of the songs I gotta get use to."
3,A few gems but The specials were the ska wonders!,"Madness no doubt has a few classics- One step beyond Our house House of fun The prince and Embarrasment, and maybe Madness (they call it) is allright. But when it comes to British ska they are a distant second to the Specials whose recordings sounded tough authentic while madness's came off to polished and well too ""white"".(the Specials were interracial and had the best (riddim) section in london. This is a good way to collect the well known hits and for the money its a good buy i guess- but alot of this material sounds welldated in that bad eighties way- ive seen Madness live however and they sound better live than on recordings. This is all a casual fan would need for sure- if youre new to the first wave of british ska then pick up the Specials debut which is a true ska classic."
4,"A Bit of the Best, but not quite ""Best of""","This really is a pretty decent dose of Madness, and it was good to see they picked a generous selection from the first two albums.The only downer is: the first two Madness albums were fantastic, and, in my opinion, they lost much of their pizazz on future releases. It's hard to picture a Madness ""Best of"" without tunes like ""Bed and Breakfast Man,"" ""Middle of the Night,"" ""You Said"" and ""E.R.N.I.E,"" especially when they include mediocre songs like ""Michael Caine.""This is a good ---but not great--- Madness collection. But if you want an excellent selection of Madness tunes, search for their first album and ""Absolutely."""
4,The Nutty Boys are Back,"I defy you to listen to track 4 (""Baggy Trousers"") without doing that ridiculous SKA dance; you know, the one where you lose all flexibility in the knees and your head bobs back and forth like a chicken! This fab compilation successfully manages to maintain a sense of chronology without reverting to the 'this is all we've done with our lives' sense of decline which other 80s bands have resorted to in their ""Best Of"" albums. It's hardly up to the standard of Duran's ""Decade"", and is noticably lacking one excellent Nutty track ""Cardiac Arrest"" (perhaps this track wasn't released in the USA?) but other gems are there, notably the glorious scalic piano introduction in ""Shut Up"", the inimitable 'Michael Caine"", everybody's fave ""Our House"", and the ultimate sing-a-long finale in ""Wings of Dove"". Well worth its exceptional bargain price."
4,Grab Your Pork Pie Hat and Dance,"If you are a looking to re-create some of that whacky fun music of the '80s, you can't go wrong with the Ultimate Madness collection. All the essentials are here: One Step Beyond, Baggy Trousers, Night Boat To Cairo...If this gets you in the mood for more Ska, definately delve into The Specials - Singles Collection. They are the one that brought the genre into the college radio circuit. If you want to go back into ska history a bit, search for The Skatalites or Jump With Joey."
4,Slow Stitch,"Felt bad there was no review of this little classic. Noisy, but cluttered in a soft way. Ambient, yes. I notice there are reviews of the band's second album ""First Tone"". Any fans of that goody should surely dip into this. Don't leave this one hanging. Recommended: ANYTHING on the Drunken Fish label."
2,My Cd's,the cds came in a new package and looked professional. HOwever when I went to download them on to my computerevery CD was reading as CD6 . So I had to go and rename each CD as to not get confused when i was listening to them. I have to hoestly say that This is the first time I have ever had issues with ordering stuff from Amazon.The process of renaming and downloading the cds onto my computer was very Frustrating!!
5,Dr. Wayne Dyer's take on the Law of Attraction,"I love listening to Dr Wayne Dyer. Unlike a lot of audio recordings with authors that have voices that can put you to sleep, Dyer has the ability to entertain and engage the listener with every word he speaks. The Power of Intention, like the book outlines how you can change your energy to attract the things you want in your life. This CD inspires me and lifts my energy vibration everytime I hear it. There is much to absorb and much to learn from this recording. Highly recommended."
1,Memoirs of Some Content Old Guy,"Sit on any bench at the park where there's a retired unchallenged and content looking old white guy whose feeding pigeons or people watching. Then you won't have to buy this and plus can get a face-to-face delivery of the same common sense wisdom, via personal stories, that you probably already know anyhow."
2,wasted time,"I thought the information would be good and some of it is, but it all revolves around GOD. That is not what I was looking for. I did not want religion. I wanted insite, positive thinking stuff. If you like GOD stuff, go for it, otherwise forget it. For me, a waste of time and money. Scott"
2,"Not an academic read, but an affirming romp for the faithful.","I remember Dr Dyer in the late seventies and eighties as a voice of peace and reason in a sea of confusion. I hadn't picked up anything by him for a long time but the title of this set seemed to strike me as just what I was looking for and I was glad it was by someone I had once read and enjoyed. But, alas, religious rhetoric abounds and, for me, that means all his credibility is now gone. If you are one of the faithful I am sure you will enjoy these narratives that will undoubtedly confirm all your hopes and beliefs. But, however, if you are, like me, searching for some academic wisdom and insight from a trained and learned professional on how to move forward in this life with peace and understanding of the far too many who profess peace, love, and understanding and yet vote for violence, fear, and hate, then move on, for Dr. Dyer has now joined the ranks of those who would somehow prefer to believe in their ghost stories."
2,Dis-Appointed with my purchase.,The product I received from vender was missing Disk 2. I was displeased with this order and will not purchase again from vender.
5,Intention = Attitude,"Whether or not you've read Wayne Dyer's book, ""The Power of Intention"", you can benefit from the message on this CD set. If you DO read the book, I believe you'll get even more from Dyer's teachings about intention, and how to make it work in your life.There have been hundreds of reviews written here on Amazon about the book. Lots of those reviews focused on Wayne Dyer himself, and not on the message he tries to convey. That's unfortunate, I think, because the message itself is important.My interpretation of Dyer's message in ""The Power of Intention"" (both the CD's and the book) is: Intention is really all about ATTITUDE. YOUR attitude, and how you choose to look at, and think about, life.Hey, we can ALL use an ""attitude adjustment"" from time to time. For that reason alone, the book is worth a read, and the CD's are worth a listen.Reviewer: Linda Painchaud-Steinman, Park Edge Books"
4,Great for changing your outlook,Much better than the original four disc that this series is based on. For the 1st time Dyer listener this would be a great intro to his teachings.
3,The jury is still out,"Bought this product at Marshall's for around $10. Was in new packaging;with plastic sealed on box. Expiration date was stamped on bottom of box. Have used it morning and night for 4 days now. Wanted a product for firming up my jaw line and neck. I am 50 years old, and my skin is in great shape- just getting a little droopy now around my jaw lines... The product is a bit greasy feeling going on, u need to really rub it in. I have not seen ""immediate results"" as it claims. Will give it more time and review it again in a few weeks to be fair. Could not find ANY reviews on this item- if anyone knows of any, or has had success with this product, please let me know! (Maybe its just no good and that's why it was at Marshall's...)"
2,Christian Dogma Mixed with Logic,"This book is loaded with Christian overtones, Bible verses, and other religious dogma. It does cover a large number of common logic fallacies with a plethora of examples and exercises for the reader in an easy to read format. If you can step around (or want?) the religious dogma mixed with your logic then you'll find this book useful for kids 13 and up."
4,Fallacy in Critical Thinking,"The brothers Nathaniel and Hans Bluedorn have written an easy to understand book in the common fallacies of reasoning that break logical arguments. As an elderly reader who has forgotten much of the material, it is a refreshing and humorous reminder of these basic fallacies. Written for a 7th grade reading ability, it nonetheless is enjoyable for all ages. Critical thinking is a lost discipline in modern life since the government schools deliberately dumb down education to keep the masses stupid. Coming from a Christian world view these home school taught boys revive this lost discipline in a fun manner."
1,Full of contradictions and fallacies itself,The five star reviews on this book are obviously all submitted by the author by the writing of them. Tried to read it and after the first chapter i realized the book wasn't written by anyone knowledgeable of the subject of logic.
4,Should be required reading in schools today,"An excellent book on the topic of logic. It explains about 40 ways to recognize bad reasoning. It is quite amusing at times and is written at a fairly elementary level. This book is strong on common sense, but nevertheless needed today considering the ignorance in the world related to creationism, politics, religion and other important topics."
5,Excellent book for learning how NOT to think...,"I recommend this book for anyone who is new to logic--or perhaps doesn't even know what logic is (by the way, logic is a method of reasoning). In this easy-to-read book (with some great cartoons and illustrations), the Bluedorn brothers cover various topics dealing with bad reasoning skills. For example, they cover avoiding the question, making assumptions, statistical fallacies, and propaganda.Avoiding the question is something politicians are good at, but after reading this book, you'll recognize--oh so quickly--every time they avoid the question--especially in debates, such as the presidential debates.Most ads are filled with propaganda, which is hype designed to mislead. However, after you read this book, you won't look at ads like you used to.So if you want to learn how not to think, this is a good book to start you on your way."
2,allright,"Well the product does what it is supposed to do, the complaint I have is the stampings on the 19mm socket it is so light you can't even read it, would have returned but I couldn't afford to wait another week for a new set, all in all if I can't tell if the socket is metric or standard what's the point, so much for stanley quality."
2,Not all it should be.,"I haven't purchased this set for one reason. There is no 18mm size in this set, this is a very common size for automotive work, which is what I wanted them for. I am sure the quality of the sockets included is fine, it's the missing size that makes it a purchase killer for me."
4,Excellent Value,Even If you don't think you'll need deep sockets these did the trick for changing out front struts. Less costly than Craftsmen.
3,if you need 15mm and 18 mm don't buy,for some reason the 2 sockets i have needed this past job weren't included in the case. buy the good set that has all sockets because this set doesn't.
4,stanley impact socket set,nice cheep set and they do the work but i wish it was snapp-on. Great cheep set for the low bu-git person!!!
5,It's a Socket Set,"Seriously, how bad could it be? Sockets look good, probably still China but the name brand is OK. Haven't used it yet as I am waiting on the Milwaukee cordless impacr wrench."
3,Good to have tools,Come with plastic case. Less expensive tools to have for the air impact tools. A little slippery when oily though.
2,Partial Socket Set (By Design),"This kit is missing important sizes.I would like to clarify for all potential buyers out there that this is a PARTIAL socket set, not a FULL socket set. What did they do, keep 4 sockets at the factory so I don't have a fair chance to lose them at home?The missing sizes are not uncommon ones either. There is no 18mm in this kit, and about every other bolt under my Ford is 18mm."
4,Works fine,"I don't make a living with tools, so I don't know how well these stack up against Snap On, Matco or even Craftsman. But they work for me for my occasional use and they didn't break the bank to have sitting around."
1,Missing 2 of the 11 sockets...,Missing the 19mm socket and 24mm socket. Somebody put two 21mm sockets and took the 24mm and 19mm. I returned it the next day. Not happy
1,Used Set Received For New Purchase,"I received this supposedly new socket set two days ago. Some sockets had obviously been used and still had dirt and grime in the sockets. The case was even dirty. I did not get a 16mm socket, but had a Husky 3/4"" socket in the set instead. My order came from Amazon and not another vendor, and they need to do a better job of quality inspecting. The set looks like a good thin wall impact set, and if it was received in new condition I would have given it a better review."
2,a book really for adults aimed at children,"Parade of Colors has great photos of Cirque du Soleil shows, but the tie in attempt of this book for younger readers who don't know the show doesn't quite work. Since it is teaching about colors I think the intended audience will be those almost completely unfamiliar with the show. However the photos are filled with colors and the text does rhyme (although the cadence isn't always perfect). And at the end of the book we get to learn which shows all the photos are associated it. Maybe you will even recognize some of the characters yourself."
3,Sparo's beauty is sparingly sparse,"Unique singer-songwriter with a hauntingly bleak take on the craft; maybe that is why the deformed traditionalist ended up on Constellation records. Recording sad laments to the pace of a snail is no easy feat. The artist is to be commended for attempting this motionless pulse with darkened conviction, apparent through a few of MRS's triumphs, though too often it becomes apparent the gathered weight created is strained to melodically hold water. Instead, an overriding heroin-type aesthetic gives way to unmemorable chord transitioning and severe gravelly, and gravely, vocalitis."
3,Too Short of a Series to be a 'Box Set',"First of all, I am a huge Patrick Stewart fan. I can watch anything of his and be enthralled by his superior acting ability. Now, let's get to the fine print: buy or not buy? If you are a sci-fi fan, especially of the world catastrophe science type, you will enjoy this. The writing could be better, but Stewart holds it together.My biggest beef of 'Eleventh Hour' is that is only 4 episodes of approx 70 minutes each! Within just a few short hours you've watched the whole thing. I'm just not a fan of 4 episode Series'. A consumer just doesn't get the bang for the buck. If you can cabbage onto this for under $20, including shipping, you will probably just break even on satisfaction level. I personally think NO show should be called a series if it involves only 2 DVDs and four hours of total running time."
2,Eleventh Hour,A disappointment. Deffinitely not Patrick Stewart's better work. Quite anti-God and anti-American.
3,Four episodes of a fascinating concept show,"Patrick Stewart (Prof Ian Hood) serves as a Government Science Advisor whose job is to investigate anything unusual--not just crimes, but from the episodes, I'm gathering anything that could have an impact on public health and welfare. From what I gather, the show was a mid-season replacement and was only four episodes into the run before cancellation.As another reviewer said, 11th Hour is an interesting showcase for Stewart. Prof Hood investigates everything from illegal cloning to miracle cures in those four episodes. I suspect if the network hadn't cut the run as quickly, the show might have stood a chance of succeeding. While the fourth episode was not the most compelling, the cast did seem to catch their stride at that point.Downside is the film is awfully dark and the quality is not what it should be. Still the four episodes are worth watching and owning if you are a Stewart fan."
5,Wonderfully unique and well written,"All four shows were very well done. Though the last two differ in style than the first two, they are equally as watchable. Nothing trite about these episodes. They tackle scientifically contraversial issues in a candid way and leave you in suspense through the first half of the episodes."
5,The Hasty sisters are wonderful!,"The four Hasty girls--Rufa, Nancy, Lydia and Selena--are the most loveable young women to appear in a novel since Jo March and her sisters in 'Little Women.' Yes, they want to fall in love and get married, but much more than that, they want to help each other and save their family home. It was because these sisters cared so much about each other that I cared so much about them. I loved this book the way that I loved the story of another eccentric English family, 'I Capture The Castle.'"
3,I paid for this book?,I bought this book awhile back because my library didn't own it (they still don't). I really had a hard time buying into the character of the Zed & how he had this mesmerizing influence over such a great number of women. The seemingly over-glowing descriptions of the Hasty sisters didn't make them as real to me either. For some reason I kept having to remind myself that this story was set in the present. I was also jarred by the use of f*** & some of the sex scenes because it didn't seem to match the over-all tone of the book. All in all it was fairly entertaining but I wish that I had waited to request an interlibrary loan rather than spending money on this.
4,A Darling Novel,"With a title such as ""Buried Alive,"" one might expect a grizzly novel, but nothing could be further from the truth. This is a delightful tale and one that deserves a wider audience. The book served as the basis of a little-known Broadway musical in the 1960s called ""Darling of the Day,"" by Jule Styne and E.Y. Harburg, starring Vincent Price and Patricia Routledge (best known for her TV show ""Keeping Up Appearances""). The book and the musical are sweet and endearing, two adjectives that may turn off some modern readers, but it's their loss."
3,"I find the review by ""O"" aka Mikey completely unhelpful in decoding the worth of these DVDs","I have always been fascinated by the markings on our dollar bill and things like that, so I figured this would be a good set of DVDs to get. To that end, Maria's review was VERY helpful in making my purchase decision, while ""O's"" review (ie Sgt McCluskey aka Mikey) was completely useless in making my purchase decision. Thank you Maria. Also, why would someone name themselves after a famous 70s porn movie (The Story of O)? That is downright wacky and perverted. Decode that mystery people."
3,Missing Episodes,"Midsomer Murders is my all-time favorite mystery series, beautifully photographed and with superb acting. Five stars for the programs, but no stars, I'm afraid, for these disks which contain only four of the six episodes of Series 7. After waiting forever for the release of these disks, what a disappointment to find that ""The Maid in Splendour"" and ""The Straw Woman"" have been omitted without explanation. How much longer must we wait (and how much more must we pay) for all of Series 7 and the following series to be released? (Average of 5 + 0 = 2 1/2)"
1,no subtitles,I could not look at this product because their have no subtitlesand - like many other customers - I am slighly hear-impaired
5,Great Show!,I'm slowly collecting all of the Midsommer Murder DVD's. I enjoy them a great deal. Glad y'all have them for sale. The Fisher King was superb.
5,Great Fun,"We have been loyal and avid fans of Chief Inspector Barnaby for a number of years now. Have read some of the paperbacks (Sgt Troy is a bit of a skirt-chaser!) and just love this, the most recent set. For anyone who enjoys just the quest without police or external politics and diversions (such as PD James), this is for you. Go for it!"
5,Midsomer Fan,I love Midsomer Murders and I had really missed seeing it on TV so I started my own collection of the DVD'S. This is a really good set its the last one with SGT. Troy and the first one with SGT.Scott. This is a really good set and one you need to keep up with the series.
4,Very Nice,"It was a really good book, just when you thought all was lost everything came together for a very happy ending."
4,Tender-hearted Terrorist,Interesting family dynamics for the two main characters. Likeable love story with just enough tidbits of background history to peak my interest and not put the book down. Have already purchased two more books in this series to read on cool fall evenings with a good cup of tea.
3,An ok read...,"I finished The Last Bride in Ballymuir in a couple of days, but I had to take a break from it at one point because it was moving slowly. If I'd been reading an actual book rather than the Kindle version, there's a chance I would have just flipped to the last chapter to finish it already. It was ok, but I won't be seeking Ballymuir titles."
2,Hope this is Really the Last Bride of Ballymuir,"I rarely read, what my step-daughter calls, ""bodice rippers"" but I was seduced by the title of this romance and the cover which promised a romantic tale set in Ireland. What I discovered was a thin plot peopled with stock characters, and stilted dialogue which made an effort to mimic the Irish twist on the English language. The back cover of the paperback promised immersion into a world of ""age-old beauty and tradition,"" and deep passions, but what I discovered was essentially episodes of soft porn mechanically placed so as to whet the reader's appetite for a true Irish romance while delivering a formula for commercial success. The language of the novel was simplistic, ..., and the pace excruciatingly slow."
2,Could NOT read,This one did not download and cannot tell you anything about it. I could not make it download at repeated attempts.
2,last bride,"Just could not get into this book. The characters were interesting the story line was original, I just never felt involved and put it away without finishing it."
3,mushy romance,"Better then a ""Mills and Boon"" but doesn't require a lot of concentration :) a happy, easy to read story."
3,Interesting conflicts between charaters,The conflicts faced by the various characters were interesting.It was somewhat confusing as to what time period they were in.
4,Nice read,Not too bad a story line. Bordering on a redemption theme that worked in a rugged setting. I would recommend.
4,cute,It's a cute book and I would like to read more of her books. I love Ireland and was happy to find a book that was set there.
3,A little slow,"Did not enjoy this book enough to continue with the series. It had potential, but was a bit slow. Some hooks have subplots going on that are interwoven into the main storyline in an engaging way. This book tried to do that but failed to hold my interest."
3,Dragged on forever,Very drawn out. Great story line but very drawn out I enjoyed reading this story but it took several days for me to finally get through it
4,so far so good.,"Just started reading it, keeps my interest, just not enough time to read. Characters have depth and secrets they both think the other would not like."
4,The Last Bride In Ballymuir,I really enjoyed the Ballymuir series when they came out in paper. They will be added to my Kindle collection.
5,It was a great read kept my interest all the through I would recommend it to everyone,It was a great read kept my interest all the through I would recommend it to everyone love it more each book I read
1,Twee,This felt like an Irish American view of what life in Ireland could be like rather than anything true to life so it was hard to engage. I wouldn't recommend it.
3,Pretty love story set in Ireland,"Enjoyed the story. Have been to Ireland several times, so could easily imagine the various settings. Much of the humor was hilarious."
3,good,"The story line was great. If the sex writing hadn't been so ""graphic"" i would have given it 5 stars"
3,"Although this book dragged at times, I found myself going back to it over and over again.","There have been a few books that I have stopped reading and ner tried to go back to but still couln to finish,. This was not one of those, The characters and the story line kept me returning this book until it was finished and I found I liked it alot."
5,Predictable,"This was a predictable romance, but very enjoyable because the characters were ones that were either ones easy to cheer on or ones easy to want to punch out. I really did enjoy this read."
3,The Last Bride in Ballymuir,"Michael Kilbride,released from serving fourteen years in prison, is staying with his sister, Vi, in Ballymuir. Michael still nurses feelings of revenge and betrayal for those who trapped him.. Kylie O'Shea is a young woman living alone; she supports herself by being a primary teacher. In her past is a father who is now in prison. Michael is pulled to Kylie even though his sister tells him Kylie is a respectable woman and he should stay away. He also knows about her father and thinks that she may not want to have any connection with an ex-convict; but Michael feels alone and cannot keep away."
5,great book,"again i love the irish stories, mystique and romance. the characters are simple but very moving. love the story line."
4,Unique and Satisfying,"This is a not always lovely glimpse at life in a small town in Ireland. The romance is heartfelt and heartwarming. The obstacles to overcome are full of danger and we fear that love will not be able to overcome them. The characters are real and not one dimensional. The townspeople are like most small townspeople, gossipy and tight knit. We do fall in love with Michael and ache for his seemingly unsolvable problems. We admire Kylie for her code of honor and for her growth from shy girl to forthright woman.The author has created wonderful characters that demand admiration. This is a unique story and very satisfying."
2,A difference in taste....,"That's why the rating is so low. Dorien Kelly is a good writer. The story line keeps your attention and is not slow moving. However, I have a great imagination and can vividly see the pictures of what I read. I did not enjoy being a third party in the characters sex life. I felt it was too graphic and detailed. I think there should be an alert in the description indicating mature content. I would not have wanted one of my daughters to have read this."
4,Very enjoyable.,Really liked the characters and setting. I liked it so much that I purchased the next installment of that series.
3,Great Story line - TOO GRAPHIC,"I loved the story line but hated the amount of graphic sex..... really!!! What about just telling a good story. I was anxious to find out what Michael would make of his life, whether Kylie would finally stand up for herself. And Vi, oh how I loved her love for her brother - unrelenting. One would think an author could build intrigue and excitement without describing intimate scenes in such detail that the reader doesn't have to imagine."
4,"The Last Bride In Ballmuir,by Dorien Kelly","This is the first romance novel I have read which I really enjoyed. It is beautifully written, giving a authentic-feeling picture of the Irish setting and culture consistent with my experience of Irish Americans and the Irish countryside. In fact, the setting, the plot, the characters I really cared about, and the romance were very nicely woven together into an integrated whole. Her asking for a review at the end prompted me to write my very first review, to say thank you for a delightful fantasy."
4,Good story but I don't think I want to read any more,"I like authors who have a series and usually look for series that I can sink my teeth in, however this book was enough for me. I liked the characters and the storyline of an ex-con finding his way back into society. But I suppose since I like romance, this book really did not have it."
1,Too much vulgarity,"I enjoyed the story of Michael and Kylie and was rooting for them. However, I did not like at all the vulgarity in this book."
3,Good enough,"The story is not all that unique, but the charecters are really well rounded and get your interest right away. I finished it."
5,Fun book to read,I though the story really captivating and the characters believable. Fun Irish humor in many parts of the story. Michael was my favorite character. A little too racy in some cases and some swear words. Both were not needed to make this a good book.
5,Unexpected but very enjoyable,An Irish love story of 2 unlikely characters. I wasn't expecting to enjoy this contemporary romance so much. Redemption and having courage to move on are themes here.
5,Engaging Romance,"Confession time: I downloaded the book because it was free. Most of my free downloads I seldom get past the first chapter before archiving them. Even then, I am frustrated I wasted the time. The Last Bride is a gem in a free book manure pile.Kudos for making Michael a difficult character with his horrific past, and a large chip on his shoulder. Another kudos for not making things easy for him by having the townspeople regard him with suspicion and having the slighly off kilter constable shadow his steps.Thanks for making the heroine Kiley real. She stumbles in the relationship, ignoring Michael when she feels her job and hard earned reputation is threatened. She definitely makes up for it later.As a regular reviewer, I am sometimes amused by one and two star ratings. I often wonder if these are authors who feel threatened by the talents of Miss Kelly. The tale is a page turner, and it is well written. I definitely will buy the rest of the books in the Bride series."
5,The last bride in ballyuir,Great book! Story was very engaging and real. I read much further into the night than is typical and will buy other books by this author.
3,good romance,"Was a good book and a typical romance, but overall ok and would pass it on to friends that wasnted a good read"
4,Great read,I enjoyed this book a lot. I liked that there was romance but it had a goods story line too.
5,great crackers!,"I have celiac. I bought my first box of these at a local HFS. The plain are too boring, but with the tamari, they are quite tasty. I save a bunch of money by buying them by the case from Amazon. You have to eat a lot of them to get calories, so I could go through a box quickly. I also use rice cakes, and these little crackers are far superior to them. I make a seed butter out of toasted, ground pumpkin seeds with a little olive oil, and it is quite tasty with these crackers."
5,sesame five star,"These sesame crackers are soooooo good, soooo low cal, and such a bargain from Amazon! I love them with garlic basil chevre and Mendicino hot sweet mustard! That combo really brings out the flavor of all the ingredients. They also arrive in a very short time. Enjoy."
1,They changed the recipe! No longer tasty,"They used to be my favorite cracker but always so expensive could barely afford and also because they used to be so tasty I'd eat the whole package in one sitting. But today I splurged on a package and unfortunately they changed the recipe and they tasted bad. Sure enough I called Edward and Sons and they said due to Japan nuclear meltdown they changed the manufacturing to Thailand. But why didn't they make sure Thailand could make it just as Japan did before putting in markets? Morons. Hopefully they get their quality back. Today they taste like crap. Dry, and rancid sour taste."
4,Good fit to original,This part dropped in as direct fit for a 2002 Chrysler PT Cruiser with no issues. There is a small plate on the front side (shown in picture) that I had to transfer from the old engine mount to the new one but fitment was very easy.
4,"Quick, nostalgic read for Bostonians & Bonaventure Alumni","I purchased this book after a conference featuring Gerry Faust, Bowie Kuhn, and Fr. Benedict Groeschel.... and I enjoyed the easy journalistic style. Clearly the author was lucky to have grown up in a sports household, and he never gets too sentimental when referring to his father, an icon of high school athletic enthusiasm. I confess that the profiles of sports heroes was the highlight of the book, with fascinating insight into larger-than-life figures, although the romp through Boston and Bona history was fun. Great stuff, best suited for teenagers and fathers of teenagers."
4,Not Fired Up for Fire Again,"Best Tracks: Make A Joyful Noise, More, Slip AwayI'd really give this 3-1/2 stars.When you need a CD to lift up a song to the Lord, this is a wonderful place to start. Kim's rich voice exudes a resonance that rings so true.From the quiet of Slip Away to the more raucous More this CD spans a variety of musical tastes without over-doing any of them.While this isn't my favorite Kim Hill CD, it is certainly worthy of being in my CD collection."
5,Hymns the way they were meant to be sung!,"Kim has a strong, earthy voice similiar to Ashley Cleveland (Now there's a compliment!) ""Power In The Blood"" and ""Ruthless Perfection"" are gems. If you love powerful female vocals, this is for you."
5,Kept the pages turning!,"Can't agree with other reviewers who thought this didn't have any action. FIrst night I made it 1/2 way through the book, and I'm a slow reader. I really enjoyed the book, start to finish. Characters were enjoyable, with both human dilemas and the suspense story line dilemas to deal with."
1,it's a great title....,"It's a great title, but I'm having a hard time getting through the book. The ""heroine"" is a let down - saying that she's not too bright, is not fair to not-too-bright people. What woman in her right mind would say to a guy holding her captive, ""Why don't you want to rape me?"" There's really little plot and action, and almost no characterization. But lots of sex. But not great sex."
4,Great read,"I am a huge fan of Kat Martin, and I really enjoyed this book. There was a lot of adventure to keep you guessing as well as some good sexual tension to keep you one edge!"
5,Hot Rain Hot Read,"I always know when I see Kat Martin on the cover, I'm going to get an excellent read and Hot Rain did not let me down. I highly recommend this to all."
3,"Great romance, mediocre suspense","The title and cover caught my attention, and the premise is one of my favorites (undercover hottie with a heart of gold meets his match). The romance wasn't a let down, and the sex scenes were great. However, the action was a little slow. Especially at the end- I really expected more of a climax in the jungle. Like a dramatic ""you or the girl"" at gunpoint moment or something. But the end is sweet and funny, and the hot sex kind of made up for the not-so-hot action."
4,Suspenseful,Kat Martin is a good author who combines suspense and romance. Her characters are very believable. This is one of her good ones.
5,Loved this book.,Became an instant Kat Martin fan. Loved this book. Good story not just sex. Sexy but no smutty. I highly recomment it.
2,Too sweet not spicy!,I have made my own sauce from scratch in the past but thought I'd give this a try. It is too sweet and has no heat to it. Tastes more like spagetti sauce.
1,Poor Quality,I order two sets of these pouches and received them today. Very poor quality with paper-like lining and the snaps torn through as I went to open the pouches. Worthless. Could not use them.
3,LITTLE BLACK GIRL LOST 2,"This book wasnt as good as the first one. Johnnie is a smart girl, I hope that Jupiter DeMille told Johnnie her future and all about the evil of the white man Napoleon. I hope book 3 is much better than 2.. Napoleon, is setting up Johnnie's future, I just hope she can do something about it."
5,"""Excellent Storytelling""","I could go on and on about how great this novel is...and it is, so I won't bore my fellow reviewers. Mr. Johnson, keep up the excellent work, and I look forward to reading what you got next."
2,Sorely disappointed,"The only reason that I purchased this book was to find out the answers to the open questions in book one. The author spent the majority of the book retelling the first. The writing was trite, and the characters predictable. Again, the author left unanswered questions and scenarios. I will not purchase the third installment."
4,A good read,I read part 1 and 2 and really enjoyed reading about Ms. Johnnie and problems. This book kept my attention to the very end.
4,Worth the Wait,"After reading Little Girl Lost, it was hard to wait to find out how Johnnie Wise would continue her life. In my opinion, for her age and her situation she still lives up to her her name, wise. I read this book in a day and am hoping there will be a Little Black Girl Lost 3. To you, Mr. Johnson,keep up the good work. I now plan to purchase your other books."
2,Not Astonishing!!!,"I purchased ""Little Black Girl Lost 2"" because I absolutely loved the original ""Little Black Girl Lost"" and I absolutely own and love every book by Keith Lee Johnson. This is an extreme exception. The book was very predictable and was just not a good sequel for such a great novel. Suspicion was the only reason why I read and finished this book.The events between Johnnie and Napoleon were predictable along with the events between her Lucas. Johnnie getting to know her family was the most interesting part of the novel and even how that ended was overdramatic and was like watching a ""soap opera""! Good things never need to be fixed and the novel ""Little Black Girl Lost 2"" definitely proves that theory. One disappointment won't stir me away from Keith Lee Johnson though I will still purchase his future novels."
3,"Not Prep Bowls, PINCH Bowls","Don't get me wrong, I love these little bowls. They're well made, bright and colorful. The one problem is that they're about 2 1/2"" in diameter. They're definitely pinch bowls and I was expecting something at least twice its size when they said they were prep bowls."
4,Good for younger kids,"I was looking for small bowls to feed my one-year-old toddler and these are perfect. They don't break if she drops them, they are dishwasher safe and they are the right size for her tiny servings and her little hands. Also, they are not very expensive, so we could get a lot of them - this is helpful when you use them for five or six meals/snacks a day!"
1,So small!,Smaller than I thought it was going to be. (REALLY SMALL!) Had it returned. Still waiting for my refund and it's been over a month! Go figure!
1,Pure Drivel. Don't waste your money.,"Ugh. Where to begin? Puerile ""I-wanna-be-a-rockstar"" crud. The musicianship and songwriting are embarassingly amateurish. These guys lack heart, not to mention talent."
3,It's only one bowl!,"the bowl is fine but the picture got me to think I was ordering a set. My mistake, but it did fool me."
5,"Works great, easy to use",This product works great. I opened and inserted into my laptop. I connected using the included cable to my Canon camcorder. I used Windows MovieMaker included with WindowsXP to transfer the video to my PC. It was all very easy.
4,really good for the money,"i have been looking for a good firewire card for my notebook for a long time, and now i've found it. its great"
1,Wrong size!!,Who knew. they make an express PCIMA card so this didint work for me and I sure would like to return it!
1,Not compatible apparently...,"I have a Dell Precision M65 Notebook and this card simply isn't compatible. On other sites I have now found out that this product has had problems with other Dell models. If you are a Dell user, might want to think about a different card."
1,Did not work on FreeBSD 7.2,I had hopes for this card: the reviews seem fine. But the FreeBSD 7.2 drivers loop and time out.
2,It does not work with my laptop,This item does not work with my Lenovo thinkpad T60P laptop running window XP professional. Window XP hung when pugging the card. Amazon has good return service to take back this item.
4,Love Wayne Dwyer's voice,"Wayne Dwyer is fabulous to listen to. He's got a lovely voice which is great for chanting as he leads you through this Meditation for Manifesting,"
4,good relaxation media,"I have not quite finished listening to this product, but so far it is quite good."
1,AH - awful,"This is just the worst thing I've ever heard. Mr. Dyer literally makes VERY LOUD meditation sounds, completed with moist-mouth noises. I thought there would be more tips about meditation but instead he makes the AH and OM sounds for a VERY LONG time. His books are great but I certainly wouldn't suggest anyone else would waste their money on this CD."
4,not bad..ehh?,"Dyer has a great voice..very easy to ""listen"" to. The meditation is good, not one of my favorites..i really like deepak chopras meditation called.. ""the soul of healing meditations"" That is my favorite..I have recently purchased about 10 meditation CD's and it wins.."
1,Snookered Again by Wayne Dyer,"I listened to the first track of the CD. My red flag went up when Dr. Dyer said that these meditations have been secrets for centuries. Of the many marketing seminars I have been in, one of the first things they teach you is to let your buyers know that they are getting in on a secret.The explanation of the Ah meditation continued with meaningless psychobabble. This is the kind of stuff that Gregg Braden uses. Oh, I forgot the Dr. Dyer is very complementary of the charlatan Gregg Braden, and considers him a friend. (You can look Braden's debunkment on YouTube).Dr. Dyer's last book (Wishes Fulfilled: Mastering the Art of Manifesting) was a sincere disappointment to me as his fact checking fell short. I knew then that Dr. Dyer had sold out to the mass market, jump on manifestation topics crowd. He is now like Joe Vitale who just rewarms the last book to come up with another title.But hope springs eternal, and I thought this might work."
1,AWFUL! Hasn't this man made enough money yet?,"The Wayne Dyer one-man self-help industry never rests it seems! Product after product careens onto the market, hawking philosophical homilies cadged from other sources, mixed with his own facile and patently absurd over-simplifications such as ""you have created everything that is in your own life"". This one is excruciating to listen to besides."
1,AWFUL,"If I had known this CD was of middle eastern humming and chanting, I wouldnever have bought it."
1,I haven't tried this CD but I wanted to say..........,"....that some of the reviews on here imply that by listening to these meditations and doing them faithfully, you will get whatever you want, for example, more money. I am really concerned about these claims and question there merrit. I do agree with another reader that one would assume that this CD would be more about spirituality, then about Christianity. I'm glade I read the reviews here, becuase I almost bought this product thinking it was different."
2,Hire it Done.,"I guess I'm too far in the hole to wish myself out,best get a lawyer and hire it done."
1,The Equalizer,"From now on, I'm only reading the 4 star reviews, never the 5 star reviews.It's so fascinating how Dyer manifested so many 5 star reviews from ppl with only 1 review to their name; and so many 1 star reviews with dozens of reviews to their name.Amazon should weigh the sum of the reviews according to how many reviewers have. Simple formula--any reviewer of a book with fewer than 5 reviews to their name doesn't get included in the review avg.On this tape, Dr. Dyer claims that the names of various gods contain the same sound, ""Ah."" Krishna, Allah, Buddha, Ra, God. The problem with that claim is that it is false. Only those who don't read the scriptures believe the name of their god is ""God."" ""God"" is the title and office of anybody's god. The name of the Jewish god is ""Yahweh,"" or ""Elohim,"" or ""Jehovah."" The name for the Christian god is ""Jesus."" Even ""Christ"" is not his name, but his title, meaning ""the savior."""
1,Big Disappointment!,I learned Wayne Dyer's Ah meditation technique some time ago. On the tape he specifically mentions giving this technique to someone who was going to Las Vegas to gamble. So the guy uses the technique and wins big.So I was really anxious to try this in Atlantic City.Off I went to AC today and guess what? I lost $100.00 gambling!And believe me I ahhed my head off!So disappointed!
4,Good introduction to a new kind of meditation,"Dr. Dyer gives practical, step by step guided mediation on these 3 short tracks. Track 1 is an introduction to the concept of meditation for manifestation. Track 2 is the guided, morning ""AH"" meditation, about 20 minutes. And track 3 is the 20 minute evening ""OM"" meditation.I have been meditating for years and did enjoying using this new technique of ""AH"" and""OM"" meditation. I listened to the CD once to learn the meditation, and then did my own practice of the meditation without using the CD. I found it interesting and effective.Pros:-Good, clear instruction-Relatively short tracksCons:-Dr. Dyer's voice is loud and jarring at times, I found this disruptive to the meditation.-During both meditations Dr. Dyer offers daily affirmations during the meditation. I found these distracting.Overall, recommended to anyone who wants to learn a new technique around meditation and manifestation."
3,Not what I had hoped it would be!,"I really like Wayne and have enjoyed all of his tapes and writings, but this one left me at a loss. I have meditated for many years yet I find I can't concentrate with his voice and ""sounds"" in the background! I probably would have liked more of a guided visualization method than what is offered here. I was really disappointed because I thought the CD was expensive (for my budget)and have tried for two weeks to follow the practice but am left feeling empty when the session is over. I hope others are fairing better than I have been. I wish I could have listened to it before I bought it. I could have saved my time and money! I still think Wayne is super though!"
2,Very disappointed!,"I bought this CD with money I didn't have to spend only to have it leave me empty and with a slight headache! . I have meditated for a long time however on this CD I found his ah's and om's distracting to my own concentration. I guess I was hoping for more of a guided visualization although I understand the method behind the practice on this CD. The background music is splendid but I just found that I couldn't concentrate as well as I usually do while mediaiting. I just wish I could have listened to the CD before I wasted my money and my time. I still think Dr, Dyer is super though. I hope others fair better!"
2,"Love Dyer's work, but not thrilled with this CD","I really like the chanting. It makes it easier for me than just staying quiet. What irks me is that he has a negative affirmation that says, and I'm paraphrasing, ""my prejudices stop me from seeing the good in other people."" I think he meant to say, ""do not,"" but reaffirming the negative is not a good thing. Someone should have caught this. Also, he says ""we're not going to do this the way I do it every day."" What's the point in telling the listener that? Aren't we spiritually evolved enough to do it the way he does it? Comes across as condescending. Given the quality of his work, I was really unimpressed with this CD."
1,wow...JP OBERG said it best in his review...OM my God AH,"coulda done this myself....... JP right on. Not only was this a waste of my money but i found the chanting abrasive and downright spooky. Lest you think I am not new age enough....I assure you that i have lots of meditation tapes that i enjoy emmensley. And i love wayne dyer! his books his talks his other tapes but this one almost (and i cautiously said almost) seemed to be a way to make a tape for the sole purpose of .....errrrr....increasing mr.dyer's bank account. and believe me i have attributed gladly to that my self with my past purchases....but this one was really poorly thought out, executed, and the description lead to believe it was another type of tape BOO to all involved"
4,I Lahhhhhhve Dr. Dyer's voice,"I just bought this through Audible and am listening to it now. I can't do the meditation at the moment, but just hearing Dr. Dyer's calm voice, his deep breaths, and the sound of AHHHHHHHH is already soothing my stressed out brain. I have never meditated, but I am really looking forward to starting. I can't wait to see what happens as a result."
1,Insincere and contrived,I have used meditation tapes and CDs before and this is the worst one I have ever heard. Wayne Dyer's material is often inspiring and useful but on this one he sounded to me like he had a hangover. Definitely not recommended. The biggest question is why this ever made it out of the recording studio.
4,Could be better,"You only need to listen to Wayne's explanation of the meditation a few times--then make a tape of just the meditation so you don't have to hear the ""introduction"" each time. At the end of the meditation I added a chant (Allejuia for the a.m. and Om Nama Shiva for the p.m.) The chants continue the sounds ""ah"" for creation and ""om"" for gratitude. Then when the meditation is done I can either continue in meditative bliss through the chant or get up and go about my business while listening to the chant. I do wish his chanting of the sounds was more uniform. Some are real short and some long--however I find I just do what I feel comfortable with and it's all good. Japa is a powerful technique and so to get hung up with what Dyer is doing or how or what he is saying is only your own inability to focus. I mean--read the reviews and what great things people are experiencing. The others need to quit whining and just wait until they are more spiritually ready."
4,Satisfied with Meditations for Manifesting,"I am very satisfied with the Meditations for Manifesting CD. I listen to this Wayne Dyer CD and his other CD, ""Getting in the Gap"" everyday. It calms me before I leave for work, and helps me to unwind after I return. Oh, and I ""manifested"" a shorter and easier commute!"
1,very disappointed,"Let me start by saying that I have read and enjoyed a number of Dyer's books. I was really excited to receive my CD in the mail and listened to it immediately. It was so disappointing to realize that the majority of this meditation is simply composed of the sounds of AH or OM. I had thought it would be something more on the order of guided imagery.Still, I was willing to give it a try until I realized that it would require listening to (seemingly) endless minutes of tone-deaf chanting. I hate to sound petty but the wandering pitch was enough to set my teeth on edge and was distracting to the point that I could not focus on anything else.Those who are not bothered by that sort of thing might find this to be a powerful tool to start a meditation practice. Those who are experienced or who are sensitive to pitch can save themselves $10 and a headache by chanting AH in the morning while focusing on creating your day and OM in the evening while focusing on being grateful for your day."
4,FUN AND EFFECTIVE,"I also found this cassette strange at first, but soon started to enjoy the ?ahing? and ?auming.? Side A is the ?ah? side for manifesting what you want via Siddhi Consciousness which is induced by controlled breathing and repeating the ?ah? sound while imagining an energy flow between your root and third eye chakras. (Interesting that the name of the deity has this sound in most languages - God, Brahma, Shiva, Krishna, Allah, Tao, Ra etc.) Side B is expressing gratitude through the ?aum? sound. Soon I had some transcendent (and scary) moments because you can feel something happening at the third eye - my dogs who meditate on top of and around me, also got a bit frightened once or twice. But it was worth the effort because the manifestation did take place. Now I use this tape perhaps once a month for the pleasure of it. I can understand that some people might find it a bit weird but I'm all the richer for it."
1,Waste of money,"I bought this hoping that it would help me learn to meditate and help me with my manifestations. However, as other reviewers have already noted, it is nothing but Dr. Dyer saying AAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHH and UUUUUUUUUUUMMMMMMMMM. The ""evening"" side had him giving 14 (it seemed like 1400) ways to get close to God. I was so annoyed that I certainly didn't feel any closer to God.I listed to it once and am returning it to Amazon. Don't waste your time!"
2,"It must work, it manifested my money!","I have nothing against Mr. Dyer and if it works for you, then that is more than you can ever ask. My personal experience was I bought this at a down time in my life. I tried Dr. Dyer's formula religiously morning and night for 3 months. I found nothing different happening especially in the specific areas that I was focusing. Do you know what I ended up finding out ... There is no magic pills. Bad things happen to good people. If you persever long enough, you can reinvent yourself and pick yourself up by your bootstraps. Then as you finally think you are making progress... things are going well, you get knocked back down and kicked around. Looking back, I've found that my beatings were actually preparing me for future successes. Meditation, Prayer, and thoughtful planning help, but... there are no magic pills.May you find the answers to your problems!"
2,This guy writes too many books,"I hate it when an author has too many books. Why can't they just combine some volumes and get their point across and stop leaching money from people. You have to chant with this, its AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAUUUUUU in the morning while thinking of the feeling you would have when whatever you want to happen happens, and then AAAAAAAAAAUUUUUUUUUUUUMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM in the evening to say thanks (that's all). This is a rehash of positive thinking or affirmations with some chanting thrown in to keep the mind on track - your roommates will hate this!"
5,Great option when you don't have GigE on your MB,"Easy to install, drivers work perfectly with Windows 2003 server. I have an older box that I'm using as file server at home and it does not have gigabit on the motherboard. I had another older card that would freeze up frequently, but this one has no problem. I've copied over 2TB across it, and no problems. Highly recommend."
5,Works great in Windows 7 - don't use the driver CD if you have Windows 7,"Installed with Windows 7 perfectly - as others have mentioned, if you have Windows 7, don't use the CD that comes with the card. Windows 7 supports the Realtek chipset out of the box. Also, if you have trouble getting 1000Mbs with this (or any other network adapter) remember to check your network cable. Substandard cables may cause your PC/router/switch to auto negotiate 100Mbs instead of gigabit."
3,It's ok...up to 18mb/sec.,"I'm getting 15 - 18mb/sec without jumbo frames enable. Activating jumbo frames causes my NAS drive to stop responding.Below are the specs:Buffalo NAS Linkstation 1B - LS-CH1.0TL (Support Jumbo frames up to 9kb via Web settings under network) connected using a Cat6 to theWNDR3700 Netgear N600 wireless dual band GIGABIT router which connected it using a 2ndCat6 directly to theRealtex pcitxr (updated to the latest firmware which now included 2kb MTU) onto my desktop.It is faster, from 8mb to 18mb/sec without enabling the jumbo frames. As I mentioned, when enabling jumbo frames via device manager under the advanced tab, my NAS will become unresponsive regardless which frames I selected.Most said I should get at least 50mb/sec... after jumbo frames is enable... I guess I'll stick with 18mb/sec until I find a resolution for the unresponsive issues."
3,Bought 2 for two computers. Worked in one.,"I bought 2, so that I could hook up 2 old Win XP machines to a gigabit switch and share content from a WD MyBook Live. The Asus motherboard took it just fine and it works great. I'm not a newbie, but I could never get the Dell Dimension (which had onboard ethernet) to connect. It loaded the driver and reported the hardware, but never succeeded in making a connection, even if I shut the onboard off in the BIOS. I'll save it for another day, another old box."
5,works on Mac OS 9 but requires a third-party driver (free),"This card works fine on my Powermac G3/266, but I think I need a gigabit router to enjoy the advantage.Installation on mac OS 9 required a driver from this page:[...]zip file:[...]"
4,Nice inexpensive gigabit ethernet card,Not much to say except that it works as advertised. This is an inexpensive gigabit ethernet card and doesn't have any frills. I wouldn't hesitate to buy again if I needed another.
1,Had to Return,I couldn't get Windows XP to recognize the card. I worked with Support but they couldn't help either. Have to return.
1,DOA,"Card arrived dead. Windows recognized it but returned the message device could not start. No lights, no network connection. Windows troubleshooter said it was a problem with either the hardware or the drivers. I tried both the drivers on the included disk and the drivers from the website, even uninstalled my motherboard's network card drivers."
5,Running at 100.0 Mbps again,"About a year ago ... lightning hit the above ground part of our underground fence for our dogs. The only damage was it fried the underground fence transmitter & our home router. After purchasing a new router, the only computer that didn't work right was my new computer ... I could only connect at 10.0 Mbps. Swapping ports and other computers had no effect ... all the other computers connected at 100.0 Mbps except for mine. I tried a spare Linksys Ethernet card and still could only connect at 10.0 Mbps. I saw this TRENDnet Gigabit PCI Adapter Card TEG-PCITXR had great reviews and wasn't expensive so I thought I try it and bingo ... system connects every time at 100.0 Bbps."
1,Unfortunate,"I may have gotten a bad one, but when i plugged it into my PCI slot, my PC refused to restart. Luckily I was able to save my data with another product bought from Amazon :)"
2,dead port,"I had bought this hoping to use it in a Powermac G5 DP 2.0 (apparently the chipset is native to Mac OS X and does not require any drivers) and although the PCI card itself was seen in System Profiler, the network port was dead as a doornail. None of the activity lights would light up. To help diagnose the problem I put the card into my PC (2.8 Northwood P4) and same problem: the card was seen, drivers were installable, but the network port was dead. Incidently, this card is PCI not PCI-X. I ended up going with an Intel Ethernet 10/100/1000Mbps Dual RJ-45 PCI-X OEM PWLA8492MT instead -- which works perfectly! The Trendnet NIC might still work in Mac OS X if you don't get a defective unit like I did."
2,does't fit,I can't get the adaptor to fit in the slot! Anyone else have any answers?TRENDnet Gigabit PCI Adapter Card TEG-PCITXR
3,"Cheap, but works","Card is cheap, but it does what it says. Unfortunately, you can't assign a static IP address to the card, which made it's intended use somewhat limited for me."
5,GREAT Equipment!!!,What can I say... EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS PRODUCT WAS WONDERFUL!!!! A+INSTALLATION WAS EASY WORKS BEAUTIFULLY I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT... TWO THUMBS UP!!!! GREAT PRICE
1,Unreliable product.,Bought it in February 2012; it died November 2012.They have no general email to contact the company.They require customers to register before you're permitted to email them.I won't buy another product of Trendnet's.'nuff said.
3,100Mbps only in Linux,"Unless you limit these to 100Mbps in linux using mii-tool, you'll see lots of packet loss (50%+). It's a well documented problem with any RTL-8169 based NIC that I've experienced with multiple of these using high quality category 6 cabling."
5,Great,Works great and it was an easy install. Came packaged very well and was right on time. Three more words.
5,Works Really Well.,"After a storm came through I was without internet on one of my pc's and narrowed it down to the ethernet card. Ordered this card as a replacement and my computer was back on line in no time. Works really well, no hitches."
5,TRUE STORY!,"I've purchased this book when I visited the JEATH War Museum (Kanchanaburi, Thailand). I wanted a short story about the bridge of river Kwai and general information about the Railway and POWs (Prisoners of War) so I bought the smallest book that existed there, but what I've got was a small treasure. It's an actual story told by POW who survived. Contains the conditions experienced by the author and other prisoners while constructing the railway connecting Thailand and Burma, the history of the second world war relating to Asia, estimates of POWs and labored employees worked and deaths, also few maps and photos, statistics of length, bridges, camps names and distances. It also contains comparison to the movie ""The bridge on river Kwai"" and to novel on which the movie is based on (written by Pierre Boulle) where he identifies inconsistencies with actual facts. I wish I could give 10 stars."
5,:),"Exactly what I needed. A little worn, but it's what I expected considering the price.... über cheap! Over all an awesome product."
3,Needs to slow down with visual aids,"Too fast demonstrating his techniques. Probably the fault of the editing. Lefty's approach and philosophy has much to offer, even to the best of casters. Could have done some more slow/stop motion for the benefit of the viewer. Clarifying diagrams and figures depicting rod motions should have been inserted"
4,OK As A Supplement To The Original Greatest Hits,"If you want a mere quick study of Santana, this sequel compilation to the first greatest hits set is certainly appropriate. The first three songs Persuasion, You Don't Care, and a live version of Black Magic Woman are definite keepers. Also quite special is Guajarina, L'Touisanit De Overture, and the mellow Stormy.Personally, I would explore the first three classic Santana recordings as those CD's have many other high quality tunes not available on this compilation. Also, Carlos Santana has so much talent brimming in his fingers that it would be worthy to check out his other CD's to gather a better feel for his latin flavored styles which always soothe the soul. However, this sequel is fine for those who merely want the quick study approach."
3,Not nearly as good as Volume 1.,"Some great tracks, but most of the best songs here are on volume 1 too (yes they overlap!). The live variants here are good, but the original versions are classics. Some of the songs on volume 2 seem a little dated to me (unlike volume 1, which seemed to contain mainly timeless classics). Before buying this, first consider buying an original album, like Abraxas, or volume 1."
3,"Not having the best, but good for the collectoin","Vol. 2 gives out an okay collection of Santana songs that haven't been heard by the crowd. Most of their songs are pretty much okay (not as good as Vol. 1 obviously) but some just don't bring out the feeling of Santana. Big Santana fans that have listened and love every, I repeat, every song he's ever written (In which I highly dought), then this is a great album for your collection. I also recommend this album for those that want to hear more of Santana but no for those who want to experience Santana for the first time. It your decision really."
4,Fascinating subject treated with thoroughness and aplomb,"Very informative and entertaining series, but is stronger on the side of entertainment. Does not replace reading history books."
3,Monarchy With David Starkey,Monarchy With David Starkey is great if you like historial documentaties. i my self like the part about herny the 8.
5,David Starkey scores again!,"All Starkey's work is a careful and accurate study of whatever or whomever the subject may be. Met him in London and he signed my Elizabeth I. He's so very knowledgeable, kind, and warm with his fans! This one is terrific, too!"
1,David Starkey Monarchy,"I was quite peeved when I got this expecting to be able to see series 3 and 4 which are missing from Netflix. it was COMPLETELY confusing on the website what was included in each set. I really wanted the entire series and this one said ""complete"" on it. VERY disappointed."
2,Sound volume goes up and down all throughout,"I am dismayed to have to return this item. The content is fascinating. The volume was not. All thoughout both discs, the volume fluctuated wildly. I assume it is a problem with the reproducing of the digital signal and the man doing the reproducing was asleep at the volume knob.Too bad. I would have loved to own this and watch it often as a study material. Not sure how to get a good copy."
4,Great introduction to the history of English monarchs,"Loved it. Saw it on TV but missed the first half. Loved the re-enactments and the scenery. Wished it went into further detail on the earlier monarchs, as well as covered the monarchs after BPC."
2,Not bad,"This is one of the better trainers out there. Toxic rubber smell is low and the resistance is just right. I am on my second trainer. The first one lasted a couple of years. The most recent trainer lasted just about a year. I was using it the other day and it just cracked right in half, the rubber wore out: hence the two stars."
4,Its like medium resistance,The price was fair and the resistance is good enough. If u want higher resistance than by the 50 lbs one.
1,worst snare ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,PPPPPPPPPPPLLLLLLLLLLZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ DONOT BUY THIS SNARE. ITS HORRIBLE! IT BROKE WHEN I FIRST GO IT. ITS CHEAP FOR A REASON. PLZZZZ ITS FOR YOUR OWN GOOD HARD EARNED MONEY. YOU MAY THINK I JUST DIDNT TAKE CAR OF IT OR SOMETHING. GO AHEAD AND BUY. YOU WILL BE SORRY.
5,Great item,"I bought this item and love it. The Banshee is more detailed than McFarlane's Halo 3 and Reach toys. It is actually more detailed than the in-game Banshees. The included Elite isn't quite as nice, but he'll be spending his days in the Banshee, so it doesn't matter. I am unsure about its play value, but it makes a great display piece. I'll be hanging it from the ceiling on fishing line, and it will be perfect. It doen't have that metallic sheen in the picture, but it is a great piece, and will look good suspended over my other figures.Also, the figure is of similar size as the Halo 3 and Reach figures, so someone may be able to get one of them in there too."
3,Does not stand the test of time,"This series of short stories has a very distinct 1970's feel (because they were written in the 70's!) which I personally do not really appreciate. It is a kind of morose look at the nature of people that has a depressive 70's way of looking at things. The fact is that it is more geared towards deep thinking (or depressive) people who like to overly ponder about the state of humanity and that kind of crap. It is not anything like George Martin's Song of Ice and Fire in terms of mood or writing, which is what put me off about this book. If you really must introspect into the multiple facets of loneliness or some equal emotional angst then I guess that you may enjoy this book, otherwise get a good sci-fi or fantasy novel that has action and not so much of this philosophical 70's drama."
3,Not overwhelmed.,There were more stories here that I didn't enjoy then ones that I did. When you buy a short story collection you have to expect some gems as well as some duds and that is the situation with this collection.
3,Content Critical,"I was a little taken aback by the quality of the printed copy... we use these books at work and when I compare it to earlier orders of the publication, this one and the Style Guide look like photocopies."
4,Importance of Content,The importance of this book is that the authors genuinely provide advice that is authoritative and comprehensive. What is pleasantly surprising is their ability to put it in layman terms - this is amazing. It is also suitable as a reference book.I totally agree with the contents of the book as I run a few portals.This book is a must-read for people who have a web presence. Aspiring writers will also find this book very relevant to prepare them to have an online presence.Good work.
5,Because people read on the Web,"Writing for the Web is not the same as writing for print because people read differently on the Web.Every Web writer and designer needs to learn from the standards, rules and insights that this book delivers. It's the first book that understands that the number one thing people do on the Web is reading."
4,Making the Complex Simple,"Gerry McGovern takes the complex matter of designing a Website and managing its content and simplifies it into the logical world of production. He compares and contrasts Web publishing to print production, providing illumination for the many of us struggliing to organize, staff, and maintain top-notch sites. Must reading!"
3,"Showerhead does what it should, not much more","I can't say I'm disappointed in the quality of the showerhead, but I suppose in the future I'll spend the extra cash and get a nicer one. The biggest issue is that the head sprays such a fine mist that the water will become cold after being exposed to air for half a second. If you are directly under the shower, no problem, but step a bit away and you'll be getting goose bumps.But hey, the price is right, just realize that you get what you pay for."
5,Best Carpenters Single,"This CD single is the best Carpenters Single in quite sometime. Karen sings ""Leave Yesterday behind"" as if she is singing before you at the dinner table. I am grateful for Amazon.com for making this Japanese only import single available to me. I find the Carpenters music very theraputic given all the health problems I have. This single is highly recommended and well worth the price! I can't wait until I get the album!"
1,not worth the price,"Cheaply made. Looks ugly. Had problems ordering it. The manufacter back orders items and then never delivers. Puts you on waiting list. Lowers the brand reputation in a lame attempt to make it unavailible and thus seem like a special item or exclusive. Very unreliable company. If I have to wait longer than I should I get angry and usually sever business ties as the persons are not serious about keeping customers happy. Another example of canadian/europe conteporary decor being just hype to over charge for low quality build, aesthetics and customer service and satisfaction. They are notorious for setting high expectations then and failing to deliver."
3,Pretty good,"These are a pretty good set of speakers. Only problem I got with this is that the bass isn't strong enough for my liking. Also, I didn't think the sound went that high. Other than that, they have great sound and a nice look. These are pretty good for their money."
5,classic redd kross,"i feel this album is for FANS of red kross (i.e DIE HARD FANS, FANATICS etc..) OH MY LOVER is actually a PJ HARVEY song and REDD KROSS cover it magnificently. the acoustic version of VISIONARY is ok & the original version of HUGE WONDER is interesting but this is worth the price of admission for the amazing song called ANY HOUR DAY which is right there with classic REDD KROSS style power pop."
3,Closest thing to brown bread I've found,I've been gluten-free for over 7 years and the bread is getting better. This type tended to crumble in the package more than tapioca or brown rice bread. The packaging is the most mold-resistant I've found. I keep the bread in the cupboard until it is opened then put it in the refrigerator. I haven't had any problems. The nutritional information listed for the bread on the Amazon website is wrong. I think someone used the same nutritional facts for most Ener G products.
5,Confederate Veteran bound volumes,"These volumes cannot be overstated; thousands of photos, engravings and hundreds upon hundreds of very well written articles by Privates to Generals.The best of the reference sources. Superb !"
1,Waste of Money,"I ordered these hoping to replace a similar suction hook that broke after 8 yrs of use. I still have one of these remarkable little devils! They don't make the one I own any longer, so these hooks looked hopeful. WRONG! They won't stick to any surface for more than 10 minutes! I tested them holding a dry mesh sponge, and then holding nothing. Came crashing down each time. Also, one of the hooks has a very visible crack and should have never been sent to me in that condition. I used it on smooth surfaces, to no avail. I know it didn't cost much, but it shouldn't be sold if it's a dud."
4,Wonderful and Interesting,"This book really taught me a lot about two different types of people being able to love each other.George is a person that seems to have low self-esteem and Nina is a treasure in her own way. The book flows from one sceen to the next with both George and Nina looking for love, but being unable to find it. Nina's boyfriend is so overbearing that it is to the point of becoming ill. George's boyfriend is just a player, and treats him very bad. How can someone kick you out without telling you first?I laughed and almost cried in the book. It really pulled me into the characters and I could almost imagine the apartment and how it was decorated. I was a little dissapointed with the ending, but then not every ending is happy!"
3,Good read but disappointing ending,This book made me laugh. It was really well-written in that you could really get into the characters. I was grossly disappointed in the ending. It left me very dissatisfied with having read the book at all.
2,Confusing Snore-fest,"I saw this book at a friend's shortly after seeing the movie. I asked her if I could borrow it. She said I wouldn't want to. She'd been trying to read it for awhile, and didn't like it. I decided to try anyway. Unfortunately, my friend was right. This is a definite case of a movie being much better than a book. I really liked the movie. However, the book is too long and boring. There are so many tangents in it that have nothing to do with the central story. I can't believe I even finished it. Rent the movie-don't waste your time on the book."
3,The least of my affection........,This book was the least interesting of the three McCauley novels I've read. It lacked the edge and humor of the Easy Way Out or Man of the House. But after seeing the movie and how Hollywood as usual gutted a good story and its characters I've come to appreciate the book more now with all its complexities and character nuances.
5,One of the best books I've ever read.,"I am an avid reader and this book is on my top ten list of all time favorites. I've read all of McCauley's books. Object of my affections was the best. I lent it out to all my friends. They all loved it too. McCauley writes about the ""regular guy"" gay man which is so refreshing. Please Stephen write more novels."
4,"Wonderfully written, but...","McCauley's novel is a fresh look at relationships between gay men and straight women, involving wit, colorful vocabulary, and brilliant new observations into the complex issues surrounding sexuality today. The only problem I really had with the book is that every man George meets turns into ""I love you"" after one passionate night. I don't believe all gay relationships have to take on this serious a tone, and it certainly isn't the way that most relationships work. Overall though, it was a wonderful portrayal of how we all move in and out of people's lives, and the effects that people have on our souls."
5,One Word: Excellent,"I only bought this book because my husband wasn't going to take me to the movies to see it on the big screen. Needless to say, I'm glad I decided to ""read"" the movie instead. I was entertained from the first to the last page. Stephen McCauley's writing is touching, romantic and among these, humorous. I recommend this book to anyone looking for a good story."
3,WHY SO MANY LIVE TRACKS????,"First. I love B. B. King' s singing and his guitar playing even more. This is a collection of great performances. BUT, why ARE MOST OF THE TRACKS ON THE FIRST DISC< ALTHOUGH NOT STATED LIVE? Well, all of them are great, but what I expected were the studio versions except from the two numbers culled off Live at the Regal. This is an anthology, it's not entitled ""Live Anthology"". Plus, there is a nice CD called ""How Blue can you get?"", which is a live Anthology, so these selections were not necessery, although they are high quality music.Three stars because of the inclusion of as many live tracks. The music itself is pure five stars, but be careful if you want the studio versions of B. B.'s tracks presented here. You Won't find them here and you may have somewhat strange feelings towards this CD.You can love it for what it does include but be angry too because it's not exactly what you wanted."
4,2 disc sampler of BB from 1962 to 1998.,"This is a 2 Cd set with 34 tracks BB did from 1962 to 1998. I think for many fans that this will be the right amount. King is just too good and too prolific for a one disc sampler and 4 CDs is a big box and big bucks for many fans. What this set is missing is the first 13 years or so of BB's career (there were many good songs there), the last decade (still worthwhile music) and just a very light sprinkling of the 1990's. His over 50 year career is just too big even for a big 2 disc set but you will get a lot of quality music at a reasonabale price here. I like the fact that there is some live music here along with the studio cuts.Besides being a great guitarist, King has a great voice, is a fine songwriter and an excellent interpreter of others songs and has had a great stage presence. If you have all that and a little luck, you can be successful for as long as BB King."
3,Great while it lasted,"This was an excellent product for a couple years and then without warning it stopped producing sound. Powers on and looks normal but no sound. I googled it and there were a number of others experiencing the same thing. On the other hand it is a low cost product so maybe if your expectation is to get a couple good years out of it, no problem then."
5,Good for a beginner piano,I bought it for my 4 years old grand daughter who is learning to play piano.Very good machine. The only problem is that MIDI computer communication is NOT USB. It is done using the old clumsy 5 pins jacks who are no longer in use in modern computers. That piano is probably the end of the its line and will be discontinued soon and this is why the price was good. I am very happy with my purchase for the intended objective.
3,Not for Win2000 second monitor,"I installed this video board for a second monitor on my WIN2000 PC. Many conflicts with drivers, etc. After a few days of research I found out that the ATI Rage 128 boards will work but this one won't. Hopefully this review will save you the trouble I went through. Dell sales people and even techies were lost on the issue and it took a week to get a straight answer from ATI."
2,Not a good 3d card..,"This card came with my computer.. I didn't keep it long. It struggles to handle any 3d video game. It gives horrible 3d performance and makes it virtually impossible to play games like Quake 3, Half-Life, or Unreal Tournament. If you are looking for a card you probably already have a better card than this in your computer. Try to avoid this...."
3,Not much for the money,"I chose this edition of the Elves and the Shoemaker because it had a quaint, old fashioned picture on the front. It was $21, which I figured was because it was somewhat of an antique. The book turned out to be about 7 x 5"", and although it is in good shape, and has charming pictures throughout, the price seems ridiculous for such a small book. If I didn't need it for a special Christmas present I might have returned it."
4,Very pretty item,This is a very pretty belly ring that I purchased for my granddaughter she just loved it.
4,A Fantastic Account,"I thought that this book was a fantastic account of broadway musicals that have graced the New York City Stages during the years 1972 - 1988. One of the more informative books i have read, I was pleased to see that this book gave specifics on the shows as well as a brief description. I would recommend this book to anyone interested in the history of broday shows during a particular period. Enjoy!"
2,Cheap,"Bought it to use for just an additional power strip. Wasn't using it to power any quality equipment or anything. However I returned it upon seeing the quality of the box and the item.I know its just a cheapie power strip but even the $5 ones come in a better package than this item. On top of that, the power strip itself appeared to be of a MUCH LOWER QUALITY than said $5 power strip. Lol."
2,disappointed,"After all the glowing reviews, I eagerly awaited this item. After about 4 weeks, it arrived from the ""Amazon Returns Center"".The design is nice as others have noted. It does provide power to the 8 outlets. However, the grounding light does not come on. I called Eclipse, and the rep tells me this is an ""old"" product, and that when one buys an ""old"" product ""off the internet"" sometimes the batteries do not work. Since my product did not come with the manual, I was not even aware that it had a battery. Now that I have it installed behind a heavy piece of furniture, I will leave it there, but I do not recommend this product to others. I hope that the grounding light issue does not indicate a serious problem."
4,"Solid, Fun, but Short","This is a wonderful book. 64 pages of little learn how tricks. They use an old version of Illustrator, but they speak mostly in English still adding a few basic short commands; so its easy to adapt with new software.The tricks are fairly basic, and so the tutorials are 4-6 comic book panels long. Yes, this tutorial book also doubles as a nifty non-linear comic. No great plot involved other than some background info, some opinions, and then a bulk a tutorials and examples.To own, its a wonderful tool. But check out the Comic Craft Website first!"
2,One page was the most useful,I got this to figure out how to do things digital as far as font creation. That was one page. A very lacking one page. I was very disappointed by very poorly composite pages with very unreadable sections. Makes the explanations of proper composition kind of hard to take serious.Honestly you can find better info for free on the internet. If only I'd known.
5,Very enlightning,"This has just the right amount of info to get ANYONE started in the world of lettering. It's not all wordy. When you think of it, there is no need to be wordy on this topic. Just the basic facts and techniques. They even explain why the certain shaped ""balloons"" are created in comics.Not sure if the people that gave this book negative reviews are looking for some sort of ""magic key"", but I can assure you there is none. Just follow the directions on what to do and what not to do that this book offers and you will be fine.For $9.95 the book is an investors dream. Well...those individuals who enjoy investing into there future with key books of knowledge that is."
5,GREAT BOOK!,"This book is well written, funny [at times..] and VERY informative!! This will put you on the right path to lettering comics.I use this book as well as the recommened fonts to create my own comics!!! Worth EVERY Penny!!"
4,Great mix of Rick era White Heart!,"I only hold back one star because I prefer to get the original CDs, but this was my second White Heart CD to own after the Rock Classics. When I got this I only knew the songs from 'Nothing But the Best/Rock Classics', and I judged all of their songs by that standard. White Heart has very few songs that you'd want to skip, and none of them are on this CD. The band didn't authorize this release, so maybe that sours me to it just a bit, but the songs are great. No one can help but love 'How Many Times', and 'Desert Rose', 'Powerhouse' & 'The River Will Flow' are timeless classics. When I first heard 'Answer the Call' I instantly loved it!!! On first hearing 'Invitation' I thought they sounded a bit like Michael W Smith, but it's a good song anyway! My fondness for 'Read the Book' and 'Fly Eagle Fly' has grown much also. For me this was a very enjoyable second taste of White Heart!"
3,Older Version Was Better,"The new video helped me earn some improvement on my abs, but I would recommend the old Super Stomachs over the new one. Like most women out there, I stay very busy so it's hard for me to find lots of time to exercise. This video is longer than the old one so it was easier for me to find time to do the older version. In my opinion, there just weren't that many new techniques introduced in this video."
5,Busy4jc,"I recommend this book for anyone who has ever loved or experienced some devastating news about their health. You will cry, laugh and filled with compassion and in the end you will be knowledgeable on a subject which is of great importance in our society"
3,Book Club's Will Love This One,"Read this book with interest from cover to cover. Found the characters's believeable and the story interesting. It was a Book Club selection, so I was not excited about reading it but found it remarkably easy to read and I felt I knew the characters. The book club discussion was not only entertaining but educational. Would definitely recommend it."
2,Very Repetitive,"The book started off good, but I felt that she could have cut about 10 chapters on somethings. She was very repetitive when it came to talking about her relationship with her kids and her girlfriend. I also didn't like the ending because of the mentioning of the pill box. Does that mean that he got the disease? I just got tired of going over the same stage that she had already set up."
5,Required Reading,"What can I say about this book??? Amazing, a perfect 10, 5 stars, a must have for every woman's book collection!!! This book will touch your soul and have you seeing your life in a whole new light. This book could be about myself or many other women in America. The story just hits home because it is just so real. Don't keep this book to yourself, recommend it to your friends, co-workers, church members, family members, single women, married women, men, teenagers, anyone that can read. Do yourself a favor and pick up this book."
5,All I ever did was love a man,I am using this fabulous book for my local book club and took a chance on emailing the author and inviting her to attend. The author was available for May (I offered to have the book club according to her availability)! I am excited and look forward to a stimulating discussion with Dr. Ottey and my book club members.
4,One Man's Trash is Another Man's Treasure,"I found this book on the 75% discount table at a book fair and glad I bought it. Even though it didn't address that if a person withdraws from sex for 7 years, then they are a reborn virgin. I'm still in search for a novel that covers this. But I am glad I read this book because it covered the topic of HIV/AIDS that seems to dwindling in the news. It's not talked about as much as it was in the 80's and 90's. It makes you think that a cure has been found or that it's not life threatening anymore. Never heard of this author or book before but great info!"
5,Works just as intended ...,"This retro dimmer switch is designed for older homes, meant to fit in with preexisting styles. We were remodeling our kitchen, and needed new switches, but wanted to find a dimmer switch in keeping with the age of the home and other switches installed throughout. This switch works well, and, if you like, it is possible to buy swappable decorative dials online to match almost any style. Simply pop off the old dial, and pop on the new one. The particular dimmer switch I bought is intended for a 3-way installation -- the dimmer operates and dims the lights from one end of the room, and the toggle switch on the opposite side simply turns them on/off."
3,Not The Best For the Money,"These bowls are great out of the box. After that they are hard to keep clean, dishwasher or hand washed. They stain easily and the lids pop off in the fridge. After storing food in fridge, you have to transfer to another bowl to heat in mircrowave or oven. Bases are great, but that's about all."
3,Nothing New,"The ASA Cessna 172 Reference Book offers little in the way of new information. It's more of a rehash of The Pilot's Operating Handbook, written in more layman's terms and with perhaps a little more detail. Nothing to get excited about."
4,Cessna 172 review,"I haven't flown in many years. Before using a computer flight simulator I needed a review of the Cessna 172. This book provided just what I was looking for. It will not teach me how to fly but, it will bring back once known facts and settings of this aircraft and make X-Plane more meaningful.Cost very reasonable, shipping was quick and the book was well packaged."
5,Awesome Guitar Hanger,"This is the classiest way to store my guitar that I've ever seen. It's out of the way, looks cool, and is totally accessible."
1,left marks on my guitar,"the padded part left black marks on the neck of my natural colored Les Paul and my white schecter. i was able to sand and buff them off, but forget that, it's not cool at all to have a hanger damage the guitar!!! what's the point??I traded to the string swing 3 months ago and it doesn't leave any marks on their necks like this thing did in a few weeks. Plus the string swing feels sturdier holding an LP custom and was half the price and Made in USA, not china. I found out String Swing is the brand SamAsh chooses to hold their guitars and ampsskip this, get 2 of the string swing."
4,Almost 5 stars...,"... but the mounting screws that come with this are an absolute joke. I don't know anyone foolish enough to trust a treasured musical instrument to the puny screws that are supplied with this hanger.Anyway, once you've got it mounted securely with the fastener of your choice you'll be very happy with it. Now I don't have to worry about drunken friends bumping my guitars off the wall. I've already purchased 3 and will be buying more soon."
5,Perfect,"Perfect product. I have 5 of them with out a single complaint. If I had to complain I would say the plastic anchors are a little sub par, but I used my own anyway. I also installed small rubber door stops behind each guitar because they are hanging in a hall way where they could get bumped into the wall. Under normal circumstances the guitar hangs plenty far enough from the wall (even a full size acoustic). Click on my name above for a picture of guitars hanging, shouldn't the manufacturer show you that?"
5,Great mount for guitar,This is a very secure way to store your guitar up out of the way and off the floor. Padded arms protect the guitar and the self closing tabs make it so the instrument will not slip off and also prevents my little ones from pulling it off the mount. You need to lift the guitar to open the tabs then remove it from the mount. Very ingenious. I have two and I am completely satisfied.
3,"Good, but ineffective drywall accessories","I would have given this five stars had the drywall mount accessories worked. They don't. The hanger is held flush to the wall by the the screws and plastic screw anchors, but wobbles excessively when taking the guitar on and off. I wish the vendor either included drywall mount accessories that actually worked or state that drywall mount accessories were needed for non-stud installation. This would have saved me a failed installation with the plastic screw anchors and a trip to Home Depot (would have ordered these accessories at the same time). I ended up having to buy a two pack of DRILLERTOGGLE 1/8X2, screw in anchors. It now works great- no wobbles."
5,This works great for my Dobro that has a larger head,I have used other similar products that do not secure the guitar as well. For my Dobro that has a larger head it works great.
5,LOVE LOVE LOVE,Bought these for my husband because he has too many guitars everywhere in our house...the look absolutely beautiful hanging on the walls!
3,Silly.,"i wish there was a better picture of this. i would have skipped over it. the snow speeder is really silly and the ATST is only slightly less. want a decent ATST get the battle of endr set, haven't seen a good snow speeder yet"
2,Deceiving photo + 20 missing pieces = Tears,"Had I known I was being set up to spend $23 on 56 tiny lego pieces, I would have opted out. The seller's photo does not provide the lego number for the set: 4486. When we received the package, it had been previously opened, Scotch-taped closed, and was missing 20 pieces. My 5-year-old cried when we discovered that we could not build it because too many pieces were missing. Thanks, cd-source. You really made this a terrible experience for my 5-year-old. Man, I hate when things like this happen. What is with people?"
3,Mini AT-ST & Snowspeeder,"The mini Snowspeeder is REALLY small. I don't like it. The mini AT-ST is good though. It can be put behind the bigger Lego AT-ATs and pretend there are lots and lots of them coming at the rebels. I realize the snowspeeder is supposed to be small for you to play as Luke but it could have been bigger. If you aren't too concerned about that, the AT-ST makes up for the mini speeder."
1,campbells cream of celery soup,"the picture of the soup(can) shows regular old fashioned nothing added nothing changed campbells cream of celery soup...however like every where else it is the nasty sea salt low sodium stuff...you either get that or the fat free nasty stuff, what ever happen to the old fashioned original campbells cream of celery soup???? this stuff is just plain nasty!!! watching your health should be your own responsibility and not crammed down your throat by others who think they have all the answers."
4,Great Watch for a Quartz,"Overall, the Omega Sea Master Aqua Terra is a beautiful watch that reflects a simple but elegant design and sturdy construction. While this watch may not be as desirable as the automatic movement version, it is nevertheless a beautiful watch that works well and is a joy to own. Plus think of it this way -- you don't have to worry about winding the watch every couple of days. The trade-off is up to you."
3,too tight,"The price is good, compare to my dell expend battery which cost 69$But it's very tight for my dell x51v, very very hard to pull it out."
2,"Shoot, Blood, Run, : formula to Win this Mediocre Game","This game by any standards is violent. But that's about all that I can say. Sure you can hit a guy in any of the 29 anatomical hit areas programmed into the game. Sure, it's fun to watch a guy holding a stub of his foot after you blew it away with a shotgun. But how many of these images would you really like to see for the next 4 hours until you finally realize this is just what this game was all about. Nothing else. Graphics: Nice OpenGL. Might cause some problems with GeForce 256 cards. Interface: in game save. easy to use multiplayer options. Gameplay: regular shoot-em up. very formulaic: shoot, blood, run. Do this for 4 hours and you'll finish the game. Weapons ballistics are not that real. Believe me... I know. AI: can be intimidating sometimes. Look before you walk into any area. Story: weak, bad guy wants to blow up world. Overall: You'll get tired of this game. If you want a good multiplayer experience though, get this game."
4,Solid game,"If you like the first person shooter genre you will like this game. The single player mode leaves a little to be desired (not as good as half lifes single player) but the mutliplayer is great. Doesn't run too bad on 56K either. Worth a look if your tired of Unreal, HalfLife and Quake."
2,"Good Game, Bad Speed","So, your thinking of buying SoF! Big mistake unless you have a 500mgh Pentium Prossessor. I'm informing you to this because I too was exited about buying this game. I love buying thimgs from amazon.com, and I thought ""of course this is good"". I was wrong! The system requirements stated 200 pentium or higher. I met all the requirerments and still when I got SoF home it paused every minute. I couldn't even enjoy the things the ""Good"" reviews said, because all that was pointless with the SoF speed! Am I being too harsh? I don't think so! Now, I have a SoG Cd Lying on the floor, possibly never to be used again. Remember, Im not saying that SoF isn't good for everyone. It is ezellent if your computer can handle it. I recomend Pentum (or Athalon) 500mgz. Sincerely The Critic"
3,Disappointing!,"I played this game after playing Max Payne, and Soldier of Fortune was nowhere near in action and storyline. Half-Life and Unreal 1 are much better than this game as well.Cons:* You only have a few saves available, and they get reduced as you increase the challenge level. It [stinks] to have to go back to the very beginning of the level and do it all over.* You just move forward killing everybody who jumps in front of you. I'm personally tired of that idea in games. There is no looking for buttons and clues, turning things on and off, and that sort of things.* You have many weapons, but you rally need two of them to get the job done.Pros:* Each mission takes place in a different part of the world, and that is very cool because the environment varies greatly.I do not recommend you buying this game, but if you want to buy it, then buy it for a low price."
3,"Good in the beginning, but at the end it gets repetitive","Dont get me wrong I played this game for hours straight but I got bored of it quickly. The action is superb and the graphics are extremely well done although I think they could have still done a better job with it.However I didnt like the multiplayer part of it because On my comp. it lags even though I have 500mhz, 128mb, and cable.I would wait till prices go down or something."
2,"it was fun, but not that fun","yes, ill admit that it was a fun game, but i wouldnt really know because i only played it for abour an hour before it started freezing up on me, and then randomly freezing my system until i had it removed. it would have been fun if not for the freezing thing, and the fact that i had to install some driver to get my videocard to work (voodoo 3) and that its 900 (900!) megabytes to install. dont but this unless you want to waste your money, get a headache from dealing with the software problems, and have tons and tons of available memory space, i uninstalled it and now it gathers dust [alot of money] for 60 minutes of fun, what a great deal"
3,just like Blood 2...and not much better,"Well....it is a gory game with good graphics and nice AI, a good story blablabla....but....it is still somehow the same as Blood2 (also from Raven, what an accident). You are in a Subway (like in Blood2), you shoot the bad guys (like in Blood2), you have the same Weapons (like in Blood2) and well....the storyline...hehe...people who shoot others in the head do not need a big story behind it....it is anyway always the same story (there is a bad gang terrorizing the city; there are bad scientists making the most deadful weapon; there are aliens; who have to be shot at and so on). So what's the deal? You get a nice shooting game with good graphics and nice sounds and a gore level higher than in any other game. That's it. And it's not bad, but it is also not as great as the other reviewers describe it. I stick to Quake3 and/or Unreal Tournament. Sorry Raven, it is just a Shooting game in an Ocean full of shooting games."
3,"This is like the ""Starship Troopers"" of computer games.","This game is all right. Not great, just all right. It's basically the ""Starship Troopers"" of computer games, with lots of gore but little substance behind the endless showers of crimson. It's painfully obvious that the main selling point was supposed to be the gore, and that a good majority of the developers time was spent on making sure spilled intestines quiver at just the right speed, rather than designing smart enemies and interesting levels. The first level in the subway station is cool, as is the series of levels in the Sudan and Japan, but this does not make up for the sheer stupidity of the plot. While this game is fun to play for a little while, it is nothing compared to ""Half-Life"" or ""Deus Ex."" I would recommend that you download the demo or borrow a copy of this game before investing your hard-earned cash in a game that may very well dissapoint you."
4,a decent FPS...,"Now those that are attracted toward a straight-foward FPS will find this game satisfying. I probably don't have to go into details regarding the GHOUL system and what it entails given the amount of hype that has surrounded it. In short, SoF is not innovative but is fun...To critique a traditional FPS is to look at the balance of weapons and level design. My opinion: the more realworld weapons are much better than the ""futuristic"" ones. Level design is a mixed bag. Every level is contained in a maze-like environment though some are decorated with outdoor-esque themes (snow, sand, etc.). all in all, get SoF for the gore! In a sick way, it is great.so, it you find utterly destroying terrorists and the like (and have the maturity to realize that we aren't supposed to blow up the heads of our peers) check it out."
5,Everything you need!,"This game is Everything a piece of plastic could hold: Gun's, Exotic locations, Blood, Gore, and tons of moving targets(if you get what I mean). Sure this game is not for the Sensitive non-violent type but for people like me (Who could even eat through it) it's everything you ever wanted. There are unique places you can shoot people. Shoot the guy in the leg and he screams in pain. If you whip out a shot gun and shoot the guy in the head there will be no head. Shotgun in the limbs the guy is limbless. Shoot him in the groin,, well I'd hate to be him. And even more shots but I wont spoil it. Well this game is worth the price all I could do is try to convince you to buy this game. You are only cheating yourself if you waste the [money] on another game.Best way you could spend your gaming Dollar."
4,Good amateur lens,"This lens is pretty good, but ultimately I returned it because there's no replacement for big aperture when you need it. When you're shooting a moving subject in low light, f/4.5-5.6 just isn't good enough. For still subjects, VR worked very well."
5,Very Nice Lense,Super lens- good focal distance and VR a real plus. Very capable lens and not so heavy it can't be handheld. Ordered thru Amazon via Cameta Camera (super response thru both).
5,Outstanding Lens for the Price,"The product was exactly as described and well worth the price. If you shoot outside sports photography - this is the lens that will deliver quality results at a great price. Working with my Nikon D80 SLR from the football sidelines, I could take excellent action shots and closeups, even from the other side of the field. The product also was packed well, shipped promptly and arrived in excellent shape when promised. It was the most expensive product I have ever purchased from Amazon and I would do so again in the future based on this experience."
5,Very nice lense but it's a little heavy...,"I recommend this lens. I have been using it for few months now and I am very satisfied with it. It's heavy if you want to cary it the whole day in a long walk. It's very sharp up to 200mm and sharp enough at 300mm. I can't always blame the lense as I shoot very far objects and the haze make the picture look not so sharp (I haven't used UV filters with it yet; they are still on the way to be delivered).Buy this lense now if you really need it or wait for the AF-S version of 80-400mm VR if you can wait maybe few months or maybe a year (or even more - just an estimation about its release in 2009/2010 but it will be at least 3 times the price of this one). If your budget is around few hundred bucks, trust me, this lens is the one if you need telephoto ranges on a DX body!"
5,Mine survived a dunking.,"Due to a canoe accident on vacation, mine went completely underwater for at least 5-10 seconds. But - only a trickle of water got inside. Once that dried out, much to my surprise, both the AF and VR functions worked fine. All that's left is two small water spots on the inside of the objective lens (Okavango Delta water is clean!).Don't try this at home. Next time I'm even near a canoe, I'll have everything in dry bags.The lens itself is terrific. Sharp hand held shots, and really great to photo that miserable little flycatcher before it flits off again, or to take a pic of strike three from the cheap seats."
4,A good but not great lens,"I haven't take this lens on any extended photo outings, but have used it enough to realize it performs as expected. It is light, reasonable sturdy and had an ideal zoom range for an old man who likes bird photography. The VR feature works really well. The main drawback is the slow speed and moderate distortion and softness in the 200-300mm range. I have an 18-200 vr which seems to be a better all around lens."
2,Focus=Slow,Focus=Slow it's a deal breaker for me. I'm getting the 80-200 2.8- Yeah it costs more but as they say the poor man pays twice.
4,High Quality,This lens is a very good extension to its regular lens. For the 300mm zoom wiht VR control I can take very good pictures without a tripod. The quality of the lens is approved by the pictures themselves. I used it in the trips to Himalayas and Andes. The high montain environments and conditions had no negative impact on the lens. It's just a little heavier than I thought.
5,Awesome Lens!,"I was buying my first DSLR after years of wanting to buy one. and I wanted a good telephoto zoom lensAfter a lot of researching, settled down for this one. I am just floored by this lense.It feels solid, I love the focus ring thats closer to the body, VR works awesome.Here are some of the moon shots I took with this lens. I'll let these pictures do the talking!Lunar EclipseTaken without a tripod, in biting cold DC winter, bare handed (the reason I say this lens is so awesome)[...]The SuperMoon[...]"
4,A gem,"Nikon quality at an exceptional price. Allowed me to take photos this past weekend from angles and distances that I could not have had the shot with a shorter lens. The lens is somewhat heavy, yet I was still able to handhold with minimal camera shake."
4,good up to 200mm,"This is my hiking and walk around telephoto lens. it's relatively compact compare to 70-200mm f/2.8, so when I am packing for hiking, this lens is in my bag. It seem to be pretty sharp up to 200mm but beyond that I'm noticing some blur, but I think it's better than not having any image at all. also I have TC17E and unfortunately, it doesn't fit :(. notsure why Nikon didn't make it compatible (maybe it will be to blur) Anyways I think it's good lens to carry around it's quite sharp u to 200mm (at f/5.6 to 11)."
4,specialized lens,I bought the 70-300 to extend the telephoto range of my D80's 18-135 kit lens. Quality of photos from both lenses are very good. The VR works well even at extreme (300 mm) hand-held use. I've had no autofocus problems. Depth of field limitations require one to pay attention to framing and focus. This is a notably slower lens than my Nicor 18-135 which I've grown comfortable with for 90% of my shooting situations. I use an SB600 flash regularly for fill. On sale it's worth it if you have the money.
4,go further with 300mm,"it's a little slow in focusing, but it's lightest and most compact lens you can carry for the lens that reach this far. Near macro works good too. this lens and NikonD700 has good harmony i think."
5,love this lens,I love this lens! This is my favorite lens of the 6 Nikon lenses I own. I love the bokeh and performance outdoors is superb. I would definitely recommend it.
4,Versatile sub-expert lens,"I keep this lens in my backpack as an alternative to my 18-70mm lens that I got in a D70s kit several years back. I have used this lens to get pictures of moving subjects such as birds, boats, cars, and during more static situations such as on the beach or using it as a macro lens with the addition of diopeter filters. It is also fairly light for its magnification, I can take it to a weekend at the races and pan with it constantly without it feeling like a burden.I feel that it is a very capable lens and should be in any Nikonian's bag that doesn't have the cash to spend on professional level glass."
5,Excellent lens,When it comes to lenses nothing compares to Nikkor. That may sound like marketing but I don't work for Nikon. I am a geologist and have spent a lot of time in the various mountain ranges of Alaska and on the North Slope. I took my camera with me every where I went for three years and got great images of the last frontier. These lenses take crystal clear pictures. This lens allows for great mid range zooming. I have been able to use it for macro pictures too.
4,nikon 70-300mm lens,"I love it, takes great pictures.The only bad thing is the length of the lens, I need to buy a new bag now.I purchased it from Electronics Expo through Amazon and the whole experience was absolutely wonderful, I received the lens way before the scheduled delivery day."
4,I would recomend it as low budget lens,This lens has very good value/price ratio and basically it is as good as they wrote everywhere about it. I am also very pleased with amazon service as all the products I ordered so far came as I expected. Just from what I read in other reviews people should be more careful and read product descriptions and not just order based on the image. Also I always buy things flaged as IN STOCK.
5,Great lens,"When i switched over to a Nikon d7000 from my old Canon 20d i didn't think a lens could fill the hole in my heart left by my great 70-200mm f4 Canon L series lens. Now that I've had some time with this Nikon lens I love it and I don't fall asleep crying about the Canon lens anymore. It is super sharp, love the VR and colors look beautiful. Construction quality ain't quite equal to the L Series but this one is cheaper so you gotta expect that."
4,Love the VR feature,"This is my first vibration reduction lens. I love it, now I can hand-hold shots if I need to. I haven't had mine long so haven't used it a lot yet, but images are sharp and contrasty. The lens feels well built but isn't heavy. The one downside is the slow minimum aperture, which means the lens can struggle to focus in low light or when pointing at something in shadow with a polarizer on the front.Do not let Amazon sell you the Tiffen Haze-1 UV filter to go with this lens, it causes focus errors and unwanted reflections in the captured image. If you want a protective filter for this lens, you have to pay the money and get a multicoated one."
5,Awesome lens...,I used to own the non-VR version and was disappointed...the control I have now hand holding in low-light situations is incredible. Now if I could just afford the 80-400mm...someday...
4,Nikon 70-300 Review,This is a great lens that works well in action photography as well as some still shots. I find that I would like to have had a greater range of f-stops but that comes with the territory. I knew that ahead of time. Lens quality is superior. This one is a keeper.
2,"I Guess I Got a ""Bad Copy"" of the 70-300 VR","I purchased it new in May, '09. It worked well enough on my Nikon D60, considering it is a consumer quality lens, but only for about 5 months. Early in October, '09, on about every 3rd shot, the lens would grind during autofocus and zoom, and the image in the viewfinder would shake uncontrollably. This shaking and grinding would continue after I released the shutter button. Needless to say none of the pictures turned out at all. I shipped it back to Nikon in NY, and it was returned, supposedly repaired, 3 weeks later. The day after I got it back, the shaking and grinding continued. It also malfunctioned on my friend's Nikon D40. I contacted the seller, who would not replace the lens, so I had to ship it back to Nikon again, where it should be by now. Those are just the facts, but I'm researching other manufacturers products now."
5,Great mid-range medium tele,"I own a D40, and this is apparently the only Nikkor mid-range medium tele that also provides auto-focus. The VR is not quite as good as my 18-200DX, but the AF is definitely faster. Outdoors, this lens rules. The photos at 200mm are cleaner than my 18-200DX.So far, I put in about 400 shots. I get clean shots of my kids outdoors skating. I also got some theatre shots, and was impressed with how some of them came out, especially since this is not a low loght lens."
5,best large zoom lens,"I chose this lens over the Nikon 80-400mm VR Zoom because of less weight(16 vs. 64 oz.) smaller size, quicker focus, and one third the price. Based on previous factors I did not mind giving up magnification, 9x instead of 12x with the 80-400 mm lens. My recent trip to San Diego gave me the opportunity to get some fantastic close up photos of the animals at the San Diego Zoo and the Wildlife Center. The vibration reduction produced some great shots in focus during loweer light and times of movement."
5,Excellent but heavy,"I purchased this lens to use with my new Nikon D80. The two work together brilliantly. Though only a novice, my pictures look great. I can only imagine what they will look like when I really learn how to use all the camera's features.The only downsides are that it is bulky and heavy compared to the standard 17-135mm lens that came with my D80. However, this is true of any zoom lens. If you don't really need to extra distance of this lens, don't waste your money or hassle with lugging a zoom around. For everyone else, this is a great value that produces impressive results.NOTE: A UV filter is a must to protect your lens. This lens measures 67mm, just like the standard lens. I don't know why amazon has 58mm filters listed as accessories."
3,So far so good with 70-300 Lens,"I've used the lens 2-3 times shooting ski racing having just started getting back to a SLR style camera (D60). The lens is good but not sure if the auto-focus responsiveness (or lack thereof) is because of the camera or lens. Otherwise, no complaints."
4,slow lens,"This is a great lens, probably over priced because of the Nikon name.I think one could buy a faster off brand of equal or greater quality for less money"
5,What are they talking about??????,Ordered this lense through Amazon and recieved it from Complete Camera on Dec. 21. Gray market?? It has a 5 year USA warranty as promised. Great lense. Must be they are all sold out already. Checked with Ritz Camera and they do not have stock.. If you get a chance again buy it up!!!
5,Good VR Zoom Telephoto Lens,"I guess Nikon has made many different versions of the 70-300mm zoom lens. For several years I have owned a cheaper one that is auto focus but does not have vibration reduction. The contrast was poor, and in general I would rate this cheap lens a 3 or 4 out of 10. But this newer G ED IF AS-S VR lens is a great improvement.It does a good job on my Nikon D700 FX."
5,Nikkor 70-300mm f/4.5-5.6G ED IF AF-S VR Zoom,"This lens is amazing for the money. One of the best bang for the buck!!! I did a lot of research before purchasing this lens. I did a lot of searches on lens review websites and was fortunate to test a couple of lenses to narrow my decision down to a couple of options. In the end, I chose this wonderful zoom lens. I takes some great photos when paired up with the Nikon D90 camera body. I am what you would call a pro-sumer photographer, just starting to sell my work. I can't justify stepping up to the $2,500 pro bodies or $4,500 pro lenses. So if you want a excellent quality lens that can take some amazing quality photos at a reasonable price (for the photography world that is), I would recommend this lens to anyone."
3,Nice lens but dusty -- QC issue,"Very useful lens with good price. However, my copy has MANY dust specks inside the front and back of lens elements. It is not the brand new NIKON lens should be. The dusts probably won't effect image quality, but it definitely would reduce the re-sell value of the lens. Nikon really needs to improve its quality control on this lens' production."
2,Sold it after 1 week.,"I thought the VR would help improve the quality of my shots. I was wrong. Even (especially?) on my D700, this lens wasn't very good. Maybe on a DX sensor body it'll be better, but I hated it on my FX body. If you shoot FX, invest where the money makes the real difference, and buy the Nikon 24-70 2.8G lens...it's a bargain at twice the price if you want your shots to count."
5,Wonderful purchase,I purchased this lens and received it quickly. It was in great shape and I began taking pictures with it right away. Love it!
4,Great lens!,"This lens is very good, and very powerful. The VR is really efficient: with good light, you can take picture without tripod at 300mm without any trouble.The only cons I have is when the light is not strong enough: this lens needs a lot of light.. or a tripod. Otherwise your pictures will be blurry.But for this price and this great quality, I don't really care and I am enjoying it!!"
5,Everybody Should Have One!,I'm very happy with the lens. The sharpness and color are excellent. Should be part of everyone's lens assortment. The 16-85 combined with the 70-300 is a nice setup especially if you're just starting out with Nikon.
5,Zoom Lense,A great value now at a lower price! I couldn't believe the price dropped on the lens. This is a great lens for all around shooting. Totally flexible.
2,Too much money for too little performance,"Lasted about 5 months. Way too heavy a lens that's wrapped in plastic that breaks easy. Too fragile. Just a slight bump is enough to fracture the internal plastic holdings rendering it non-useable and a couple hundred dollar repair bill. Strongly, strongly recommend that if there's any opportunity that you may be a bit rough, you go to a cheaper lens. I am a 30 yr semi-pro Nikon user. Cost not worth the life of the lens."
4,Good Flag,"The star is a little disproportioned, but if displayed with a fold or something, it isn't hardly noticeable. Other than that, it's great! And the price is awesome."
4,"Weather flag, did the job.","Nylon bad weather flag is what this reminds me of. Its made light and to take a beating, but isn't the best looking flag."
5,Great wall hanger,"I bought this flag to hang on the wall, and it is perfect. Lightweight, well constructed Texas flag. Probably not the best choice to hoist up the flagpole, but very well suited for decorating purposes."
3,Good one from a Great Band!,"A good album from a great band. The mix is fair, the vocals are low and distant sounding. Will we see another live album from them?"
5,familiar to millions,"I had this cd years ago when it originally came out, but it had been lost when I was in college. I love it. Oasis at their best."
3,"Gran concierto del Oasis, lastima de la grabacion...","Aún y cuando no me considero un gran fan de Oasis, la verdad es que me alegre cuando me entere de que tenian este CD en vivo. Afortunadamente, tuve la oportunidad de escucharlo antes de comprarlo, y es que la calidad de grabación de este CD deja demasiado que desear. La musica para nada se oye con claridad, es mas el rugir de la gente que estuvo presente en este concierto lo que se escucha. Muchos aspectos que se tienen que tomar en cuenta al grabar un album en vivo no fueron considerados aqui. Lastima de la grabacion, ya que pudo haber sido uno de los mejores conciertos jamas grabados. Le doy 3 estrellas solo por las canciones que se incluyeron en este CD."
2,Where are the objective reviews?,"I am sorry. I love Oasis' music, own all their albums, but this live recording just sounds terrible. Liam's voice is really rough (too much smoking & drinking?) and he sounds half asleep/drunk on many of the tracks. I really like the new band members and Heathen Chemistry was just awesome, but they sound really new and not that great yet live on this recording. They should really release some live recordings from years ago - How about the Knebworth show? Oasis should take a lesson from U2 - They still sound great live after 20+ years in the business. Hopefully Liam will work on his voice and stay off the booze for shows in the future..."
3,A bit disappointing,"Oasis is a great rock'n roll band. I have seen several of their live performances and they are very good live. However, this can not be said about this CD. The weakest point is Liam. His voice is not at the same form as it used to be. He was at his best at the times of the Be Here Now album. On Familiar to Millions his voice does not have the same energy and sharpness. The sound of the band is also not too great. I think the band is now at crossroads and I would not be surprised if this was the last Oasis album. The album is a must for a real Oasis fan, since it demonstrates the development of the band. If you are not a real Oasis fan, don't buy."
4,Oasis Live!,"The only time we could hear Oasis live on CD was through rare B-sides or expensive bootlegs. Now Oasis has selected a gig worth recording (Wembley) onto a CD with Familiar to Millions. Having gone to their concerts every year, I can safely say the sound quality of this CD is top for a live album.You'll hear the energy and spontaneity that goes into their live act. The big bonus is hearing their covers of Helter Skelter and Hey Hey, My My. Hear their greatest hits and also enjoy their rare live performance of Step Out.This doesn't rank up there with the ultimate live album, The Who: Live at Leeds, but it does a sufficient job. If you're an Oasis fan and want to experience their live act, pick this CD up. If you've never been to their concert, get the DVD or video as well. Great companion piece to the CD.Side-Warning: Just make sure your VCR can play the European version of the video. Some of them are not compatible."
5,Very good live album.,"Taken from the standing on the shoulder of giants tour at Wembley 2000.Its a very loud and rocky performance, and theres no acoustic guitars used, even wonderwall is done on an electric.Theres also some great covers of Neil youngs ""hey hey mymy "" by Noel gallygally and ""Helter Skelter""Laims voice is quite rough and raspy which adds a nice ""real"" and ""rock n roll"" sound to all the songs."
5,Great,"This is their best album yet. This is full of their best hits and 2 great covers ""Hey Hey My My"" and ""Helter Skelter"" My personal favs are ""Wonderwall""(It's an awsome electric version of it) ""Gas Panic""(It's just a great live song) ""Don't look back in Anger"" (The crowd sings during the chorus, its just amazing) ""Cigarettes & Alcohol""(at the end they play ""whole lotta love"" LEd Zep cover) and ""Helter Skelter""(A beatles cover, its amazing, noel is great on the guitar onthis song) basically it's a great CD......GET IT!!!!"
4,TOPS!!,"Bout bloody time too, Oasis are the voice of a generation. And what better way to voice yourself than in front of 70,000 fans playing some fo the best rock n' roll tunes you will hear-anywhere. This album is a nice change from studio perfected music, you feel the passion, power, and prescence of a band truly at the top of their game. Noel plays with his usual cocky laid back attitude and Liam, well he's jus being Liam, efffing and blinding in between being the most talented rock singer of his generation.The new boys will still just be the two blokes who play guitar, but Alan White's not so new arrival as Keith Moon reincrnated gets the foot tapping and the head bobbing. Oasis wont split up-Why? cos they love playing top sounds to adoring fans and this cd proves it."
4,Would have been perfect if not for Liam,"Familiar to Millions features excellent renditions of classic Oasis tracks-the band sounds great for the most part, especially Noel's outstanding guitar work. However, the overall impression one is left with is that Liam is an annoying buffoon, completely superfluous and distracting. His vocal performance is consistently whiny and he mumbles through many a verse over the course of the cds. His indecipherable remarks and audience taunts (sometimes occuring in the middle of songs!) are amusing at first but quickly grow tiresome. Contrast Liam's poor performance with Noel's awesome vocals on ""Step Out,"" ""Don't Look Back in Anger,"" ""Hey Hey, My My,"" and ""Helter Skelter"" and you have to wonder why this joker is still associated with the band. To summarize: the cuts with Noel singing are perfect, and the band's great playing saves the cuts with Liam's crappy vocals."
5,Love it!,"I bought this because I'm not a die-hard fan and didn't want to spend the $ on all of their albums. Well, I haven't been disappointed with this one, all great live performances of grunge-lite. There's a bit more of the crowd screaming than I care for, but that's what makes it work, I guess. I can't go as far as those who call them the current Beatles but the music is fun and full of good vibes. And they do have their brilliant moments, when they get into that hypnotic-sound-fabric-thing they do. Maybe I'll buy their albums now!"
5,Perfect emission,"It is really amazing, Liam's voice is not so good but eventhough the music that they perform live is VERY diferent form the normal studio recording.I recommend you to hear it and then buy it."
5,Best versions,"This live album is probably the best ever... What I really like about it is that it contains versions of songs that are better than on the albums... Most of the songs have gotten a more psycadelic sound... I especially like Wonderwall, hey hey, my my and live forever, the sound on them are so great..."
1,Cummins Bar Clamps,"The old adage ""... you get what you pay for..."" is the truth.One of the 24"" clamps failed entirely after only the second use. The other 24"" feels like it's on the way - weak. Both of the 12"" clamps are circling the drain (weak).If you need longevity, avoid these - buy the good stuff (Jorgenson or Irwin). If you need something cheap to work in a pinch - these may be OK.Commercial aspects of order were fine - packing was OK - received the set within a few days of ordering."
2,"Page-turner, yet empty","This book keeps you reading at warp speed to see how Macy turns out and what other trouble he can possibly get into. However, the writing was simple, lacking description, at times unconnected, and choppy. Often times, there should have been detail added and more reason given for putting something into the plot (i.e. many of the ""gold nuggets"" sections). It felt like there were parts missing. This is not a great piece of literature, but it is a can't-put-down story. It would be good for reluctant readers."
3,"Disappointing, but still OK","Although Shooting Monarchs takes a different approach to making teens think about what they read (on capital punishment and the judicial system), I would prefer a book with some nice closure.I found it difficult to care about Macy, the main character, when all I had was contempt for him. The other characters were almost likeable, but it felt like something was missing.The sentence structure of this book seemed simplistic and undeveloped. I wouldn't recommend it to people looking for a fun or exciting read."
3,Boost Air Sucks to install bad workmanship,the product was a mess to install i am a trained auto mechanic and the product is a mess not bolt up install tons of fab. do not recommend to someone not prepared to make certain 'adjustments' to the product. the molded manifold had the hole in the wrong spot. once i fixed all of that i got great horsepower gains and 2 mpg improvement.
2,Disappointing and Annoying,I've listened to several hypnosis and affirmation tapes. This one was disappointing and often annoying. Disappointing because it was primarily a series of repetitious affirmations without focus on the causes of anxiety and fear or how to release those feelings. Annoying because of some of the background music. I'm sure the affirmations will work as presented but there are so many tapes out there that are better. Try a Barrie Konicov tape and hear the difference!
5,need scissors?,"this collection of scissors meets every need. they are vey useful, very sharp and priced to sell. glad to have them and will reorder soon."
4,Simply Good,"This is a great MP3 player with great sound and good equalizer, and the other features like radio and the excelent quality of video display are things to enjoy! Also, the fact that accepts several video formats is a plus. The software is very good and easy to use.Only Cons- the buttons could be more modern fashioned... make it look very old style!-the earphones are very... very common?-may be the size sometimes make it not very portable and it's something to care about."
1,Poor software,"The Creative Lab software would not work on my PC. The tech support even charged me for the call and the service. They don't have a toll free telephone number or tech support. I had to return it. Without proper software it was DOA. The iPOD I purchased to replace it works great, and there are no software problems."
5,GREAT,Has many functions. Dowloaded an audiobook from the library to listen to at the beach. Have loaded pictures. Love it.
1,Player stopped working after one month,"My player stopped working last night, one month after purchase. I'm very disappointed as I was looking forward to using the player on an upcoming business trip. Instead, I now have the hassle of returning the unit for repair."
3,Never used it,"Unfortunately the Zen Vision W was much bigger than I expected. We didn't even try it out. It has many nice features, but the size would have limited our use to extent that it seemed more practical to purchase a smaller player."
4,Some challenges,"This first Zen W had its hard drive fail at the 1 month point. Amazon replaced it promptly with no hassle.The new one works magnificently. Movies are great. The Zen software is worthless for movies, though. It will not convert movies we own like Pirates of the Caribean. When I contacted Zen on how to do it, they indicated it was ILLEGAL....and the DVD was copy protected. However, a product called M2Convert-Zen did the job with no hassle. Great hardware - lousy software."
3,Good device but false advertising,"The main reason I bought this device because it is advertising that it can play MPEG4-SP video. It DOES NOT do that and it will display a message saying the content format is not supported. I did a research on this problem and it is apparent that a lot people who bought the same device have the same problem.In order to play your MP4 contents, you will need to run the software Video Converter that come with the package to convert to wmv format. It will take me DAYS to convert all my mp4 files to wmv format. Converting a mp4 file depending on the quality of your encoding, it takes hours to convert a single file.Other than this problem, overall I am satified with Zen Vision W player like a lot of reviewers have mentioned. I have yet encountered any other problem."
1,Disappointed,"Receieved this as a Christmas present and was undetectable out of the box. Disappointed to learn that in order to get it repaired/replaced, I would have to eat a shipping charge. The replacement unit worked for one day before it too became undetectable. Had to eat another shipping charge to send that in for repair/replacement. This has been sitting at Creative for 3 weeks and I can not get a straight answer to the status of the RMA.Pros:Have no idea, since I have only been able to use the unit for 2 hours in the 4 weeks of receiving the original unit.Cons:Had to send in for constant repairs/replacements.Had to pay (to date) over $30 in shipping charges for a unit that should have worked out of the box on original purchase.Dealing with tech support is a major hassle.Poor tech support staff.I am at the point where I am looking at other (more reliable) products. I feel sorry for my poor mother who just flushed $300 down the toilet for this."
1,Trying to return,I am actually currently attempting to return this item. It was a gift and within days it showed it's true colors. I was terribly excited to give it to my gf as it was replacing an older IPOD and I thought with her travel schedule having movies and such would really be a great addition for her.Before she ever got it out of the house it was freezing up and not going through more than 30 or 40 files without having to be reset. With each reset it took about 5 minutes to reload it's library.I guess we will be trying a zune now....
3,This is very bulky and unattractive,"I already own a Creative Zen 30 GB MP3 player which i bought an year ago and i am satisfied with that. This time i wanted a good gadget which is fancy, attractive in looks and has bigger screen. I thought about Apple product but as i am ok with Creative so i thought i will go with it and ordered this new creative model. If their advertisment they have shown it very attractive and nice. But in reality, it is not bulky and it's design is not good. If you see Apple's product then you will find them far superior then this creative one. This creative is not as per my expectation."
1,"Waste product, never buy it","I bought it for 250 dollars. In 1 month it started freezing. I tried different options, it works for a while,again freezes and go to recovery mode.formatting and clean up never works. Now this product no longer works. Never buy this, a sheer waste of moneyyyy"
5,The best player for videos.,"This is the best video player that I have ever owned. I absolutely love it. The screen display is terrific. The colors are bright and the size of the screen is the best. The player is kinda big, but I can still drop it in my purse for on the go video watching."
5,Zen VisionW,"Bought for my daughter who loves it very nice screen,clear videos speaker is good sounding photos are great to download FM radio is a plus would tell anyone esle its is a great buy and well worty it"
1,hated it.,i had it for a day.cons:::* Took a whole day to charge on the first day.* customer support by phone is the worst!* they told me i couldn't return it because i opened it. finally threatened them with a lawsuit (for other reasons) and then they took it back.I would highly advise you not to buy it.
2,creative zen w,"great to play on the go but not fully compatible w/outlook No mail comp. & not imac support,can't make task on the go & very hard to make play list on the go.great screen awesome to play music (as long as you dont want to make the play list on the go.)"
2,Trouble with photos,As a photographer I bought the Zen to use as a means to store my digital photos while on the road as well as using as an MP3 player for long plane rides. The music side of it worked great.I just went to Latvia from the US and the plane ride was 11+ hours. The battery lasted the entire trip and the shuffle play worked great. The music quality was good but not great.My main trouble was with the photo storage. I downloaded the first days photos directly off the compact flash card. The download time was adequate. I have a Canon 5D camera which is a 12.1 mp camera. The files are quite large so I was happy with the download time. My main trouble with it is that after the second download session the unit stopped accepting the Compact Flash card. I don't know what happened. As a result I had to buy a couple more cards in order to take all of the pictures I needed to take.Altogether not a pleasant experience.
4,Fast & secure shipping.. Thanks,This is a replacement unit.... I bought a loft in foreclosure that had had the system installed.. but someone stole the main receiver.I'm looking forward to getting it hooked up this weekend and enjoying tunes through-out the loft.Shipping was fast and it came well packaged and secure.
2,It probably looked better on the back of a napkin,"This flavorless effort from the Wizards team marks the low point of the 3rd ed. D&D showcase series. Essentially a collection of sketches, the module serves little purpose beyond bulking characters up to 15th level. This is the worst sort of dungeon crawl; imagine your party wearing ties and carrying briefcases, and you can almost see them collecting their paychecks at the end of the day and returning home to watch TV and read the paper. Think of it as the salaryman adventure. The shame of a single-star rating is averted by the inclusion of an interesting new race which can be put to good use - in a more enterprising module."
1,Regret buying,"An interesting premise, poor execution. Maps are hard to follow. Very few interesting traps or encounters. Very stingy on the rewards that the PCs may acquire. The only redeeming aspect is that this module introduces the desmodus, a cool race of bat-like men who dwell in the Underdark. But if you pick up Savage Species, the appendices in that book fully describe the desmodus."
1,One Lousy Adventure,"I have to say, this is one lousy adventure... Skip Williams could have done much better that that. Firstly, the character hooks is really badly made, then secondly, the race of bats has a DC missing, thirdly, the whole adventure was really boring."
4,Great Picture Book For Cow Dog Enthusiasts,"When I was picking out the Siberian Husky books at the library (reviewed here) I couldn't resist getting this book about the cow dog.This group of breeds (Australian Cattle Dog, Border Collie, Kelpie, McNabb, etc) are my favorite. This book is a collection of Western themed (heavy on the cowboy imagery) photos with a little bit of text here and there. The photos are nice and the book is recommended for people who love cow dogs!"
3,A Common Sense Political View,"Are you sick and tired of whining liberal and conservative fanatics that ridicule everything they don't understand or agree with? Unlike other writers of partisan politics who only offer criticism, Ventura recommends solutions. Once you get past his macho wrestling image, he comes off as an intelligent, well-spoken man with reasonable views of how the world works. Ventura's credentials as a former Navy Seal and Governor give him a realistic view opposed to the myopic view of career politicians who have spent their lives in Washington."
5,Versatile,"It was at first difficult ordering a boot this expensive, however after two years of searching for a tall boot I can wear with skirts to work (teacher) in our freezing winters, I finally found one that is comfortable. It does come slightly over my knee. Also looks really great folded nearly all the way down, as well as folded just at the top. These boots do make your legs look bigger but that is to be expected with such a tall boot that is also lined in shearling. These are my second pair of uggs. Next order will be the classic tall ugg when they offer it in a dark blue."
5,The Groove is in the CD!,This is a great way to relive the excitement and humor of the movie. The audio (including sound effects) and visuals of this product is great! A fun way to teach kids how to read. I really liked how you don't have to install any software on your computer yet you are able to use it on your system. Plus you can play it on your stereo as well. A great gift for any fan!
3,Whats so special?,"I dont see anythign diff about these brushes...im not impressed at all. I thought that the was going to be some amazing diff? but after using them for 5 months, i can honestly tell you that there is no diff. Don't even waste your time...not to mention that when you use them with the T3 hairdryer, the individual plastic prongs melt...NOT GOOD!!!!"
2,Can do better,"I recently purchased the Tourmaline Brush Pack and was disappointed. The larger brush pull my hair (I have shoulder length hair). I found no difference in the brushes than the Ceramic Ionic Brush I bought at Target for less than $10, in fact I like my target brush better."
4,Chaos theory before it was...,"I suppose the best thing about this book is that it is cheap.It was written at a time before Henon and modern chaos theorybecame the rage.It is very good on van der Pol oscillatory theory.It doesn't mention economics, population, prey-predator dynamicsor Mandelbrot,but it deals with the equations, none the lessfrom what is at times an over generalized point of view.It is very good on systems of linear differential equationswith both periodic solutions and near-periodic solutions.It doesn't use the more modern Jacobian approach, but an earlier one.I found information in here that was useful to my own research."
5,"some more crime, drome, and nonplace urban field","these three bands are the works of bernd friedmann the best being some more crime. another domestic drama in a suburban hell is the best album but all some more crime cds are hard to come by and good.smc is an industrial sound while drome is some what techno. never singing, these bands use clips from movies, news reports, and police radios. very hard to find stuff but worth the time and effort! seach for another domestic...if looking for any if you find it you'll be pleased. P.s. the other half of smc is named frank hernandez whom i know little about if you know any thing about him please contact me...swilkes@trib.com"
3,hammock for chins,I have not been lucky with any of the fleece hammocks or baskets. The chinchillas poop in it and chew it until the elastic rips. I just don't think these things are chinchilla proof
3,Didn't last long in its true form,"I got one of these for my two fancy rats. Within one day one of the fabric ""arms"" had been chewed off, within a week a second ""arm"" had been chewed off so it hung like a curtain. I didn't remove it from the cage as the rats seemed to enjoy the privacy it offered.A week later, I noticed two holes in the red fabric near the top where it was still hanging from the cage. The rats had decided to make these holes to climb inside and use it as a nest when they weren't in their home at the bottom of the cage.So while it isn't getting use per its design it is getting used. It would be nice to have had the straps that attach it to the cage to be chew proof. At least for longer than one day."
2,Picture and description are misleading!!!!,"The item picture shows lamb fleece on one side and is listed as 'double fleece'. I received a single thickness, thin fleece hammock with no lamb fleece on one side. I am very disappointed that the photo was so misleading and I did not receive the product I expected (I am unconcerned with the color)."
2,Waste of $$,"Two of the cheap clips broke right away and a third clip came off altogether. More of my money sent to China for junk. Save your money and make your own. I could have bought a yard of material and made a dozen of much heavier weight, more durable product.I also received a thin, leapard fleece-product received was NOT as shown. Really qualifies for one star-I was kind."
4,She loved it while it lasted,"My lionhead rabbit absolutely loved to lounge in this hammock... that is until she chewed through the clips from which you hang the hammock. She still curls up on it while it's on the ground, but it does lose the effect. I would recommended it for more mature pets who aren't as likely to chew through the supports."
1,Not as pictured...,"The product I received doesn't look anything like the picture. I received a hammock that is one thin layer of cheap fleece, and it definitely doesn't have the inside wool lining like in the picture. Also, the pattern on the item I received is leopard animal print, not red like in the picture. Unfortunately, this is not worth the money or time to send back."
1,Que pasa,Porque la bachata y el merengue no sale con un DVD de calidad.Porfavor Cervesa Presidente metan mano y hagan una production de nuestra musica dominicana como lo saben hacer.
3,Low budget but ...bachata!,"This is a low budget DVD production featuring some videos and some live performances. Half of the songs are from Reyes' last CD, the others are some of his greatest hits. I believe the index on the box is not correct and that the DVD has one more song. Unfortunately you can only watch the songs one by one, it is not possible to play them in succesion. No bonus features added. If you are in to bachata, this is still a good buy."
2,Horse (DK eyewitness book),This book looked very informative in the previews. Upon receiving the book it did not contain the variety of information the reader was lead to believe. It did have a good horse history but nothing really current. Women are into a lot of sports now too. The book seemed a little biased.
3,I can eat a hamburger again!,"After almost three years of avoiding any type of hamburger bun due to celiac disease, I was really thrilled to be able to eat a real hamburger on a bun! I wrapped it in a moist paper towel and nuked it for 15 seconds and it softened up enough to compare favorably with a normal hamburger bun. The fact that they can be stored without refrigeration until opened for a long period of time is a big plus! I have not tried toasting one yet as I would have to use the family toaster-oven to do it and do not want to take a chance on contamination with real bread crumbs, etc. I would recommend this product to any one."
2,odd taste,"I have been on a GF diet for ten years. I've used these buns several times over the years and still can't get used to the odd smell and taste. As soon as I open the package I put the remaining buns in the freezer so I know they're ""fresh"" (maybe if I let them get freezer burn it'd kill the taste?). So why do I continue to buy them? Like the others I'm desperate to have burgers.I agree with another review in that homemade buns (and bread) are a lot better (but they are so much trouble to make!)."
2,Stale and tasteless,"The only good thing about this is that I can eat a hamburger on it, but it is stale, tough and tasteless. I'll see if heating it up will help, but I'm pretty sure it won't help much, too dry to begin with."
4,gluten free hamburger buns,This product is wonderful if you can't eat gluten. It must be popped into the microwave for 30 seconds to freshen it up.
3,Slippery,"While very well made overall, the handles are so slick and smooth that they are difficult to grip. Forget about trying to use them while wearing gloves."
5,GOTTA GET A BOPPY,"Nursing moms rave over the boppy, but I'm telling you I bottle feed my daughter and this is a wonderful product! Baby is comfortable and supported and your arm won't get tired! You can cuddle with her and rub her head and face with your free hand.I put her in this for support when she sits up and lies on her belly. She really likes it a lot more than just setting her down on the floor. And the luxe is so plush and pretty! Highly recommended! And to think I almost passed this one up!"
4,Great product but starting to get worn out.,"I love my boppy, my husband loves the boppy, everyone loves the boppy!I love it for nursing my daughter he loves it for feeding her with a bottle. He also loves to put his lap top on it on his lap. (attention computer geeks: the boppy is great for you too!)However Im not sure how long of a lifespan they plan these to have. I have been breastfeeding my daughter for 6 months and its about half the size it used to be. And my daughter is on the low end of the scale. I know that it gets used a lot but its supposed to.This version of the boppy is great though because you can remove the cover and wash it, something you will want to do.You need a boppy, your husband needs a boppy, everyone needs a boppy."
5,Hyperflex hot sock,I bought this on Amazon from Wetsuit Warehouse. They shipped it fast and it served the purpose I needed it for; an extra layer of warmth in cold water. It also prevents chaffing. Nice and smooth.
3,Good Background Music...which is not ment to be listened to,"As with most video games, with the exception of Squaresoft titles, the background music is designed to be just that...background music. My deffinition of background music is something that you can forget you're listening to. That's great when you are playing a video game ans ignoring the music, but it a waste of time to listen to by itself. Botom line: background music. Buy this is you want just that, or if you worship this game (in which case, there are many better games to worship)"
3,The Gruyere Railway,"This is a great railway film. I hope this is converted to DVD someday. The film in winter is a nice change from the summer scenes. There is a three video collection of the Gruyere, Bernese,and Endigene I purchased which is great also."
3,This is not Gluten-Free,"Please stop listing these crackers as gluten-free in the product search. They are not gluten-free it is stated as such in the item description...These crackers are produced in a shared facility and shared equipment as other products containing wheat! Thus, they can't be 100% gluten-free as required by a strict gluten-free diet. If you're a celiac please take note of the following from the item description:""Safety InformationFor our customers with sensitivity to wheat or gluten, no wheat is used as an ingredient in this product. However this Brown Rice Snaps variety is produced in a facility that may manufacture other products which do contain wheat.""This should not be listed as gluten-free.It should be listed as wheat-free only."
5,Awesome Vader Toy,"This toy is awesome, I got this for my birthday. You can rebuild vader that is so cool! It comes with all of the vader acessories and medical table. It also comes with burned anakin. This deluxe figure is great!"
3,"Great materials, poor fit.","I grew up making and eating ""pudgy pies"" and have always loved them. But, alas, my old maker finally gave up the ghost some time ago, and, frankly, it wasn't made with the finest materials. It also didn't lie flat. That's why I started looking around for something better.This ""pie iron"" is made with heavy-gauge iron, and provides much more even cooking on the bread, which is great. It's also nice that the cups lie flat and are easily separated for cleaning.But the problem is that the cups don't fit tightly together, so the filling leaks out. In my case, it made quite a cheesy mess on my stove.In all fairness, I've only made one pie so far, and I'm sure I'll try again. But this time I'll put in less filling, which is unfortunate, and I'll put down some foil first. Could be interesting."
3,"Good quality, but Small","We are happy with the quality of the product, but was disappointed as to the smallness of the pie iron. Probably didn't read the description close enough."
3,fantastic product but horrible mailing,"The product is fantastic and arrived in great shape. However, it was sent via FedEx ""SmartMail"" and was delayed needlessly by traveling a ridiculous route with lay overs for days. It got to the East Coast via Newark Liberty Airport (Edison, NY) then sent on land to a void in PA to languish for a day or three. When it was finally released to go to upstate NY to was delivered to a General US Post Office instead of the address in the same city! There it stayed for another day or three before the USPS delivered it. All this was unnecessary delays. And tracing it was impossible since the trace number was a FedEx number that considered that it was ""delivered"" when it handed it over to the USPS. And, the USPS could not use that trace number and there was NO way to trace it once it was in their hands. It took almost 2 weeks to get it."
5,Just what the doctor ordered!,"This item was received in only two days, much sooner than estimated. It was just as described with the adjustable elevating leg and foot rests. The only thing I had to do was take it out of the box and snap (no tools needed) the foot rests on. It was all I had wanted."
4,wheelchair,"Might give it a five star later, but for now I will definitely give it a four star on appearance only. My order looks like it will be a good wheelchair. We will know more when we actually get to use it in two weeks."
4,Worth the Price,"This is a very good buy for the money. It folds easily and is quite maneuverable. It is easy to add, remove and adjust the leg rests. Itis pretty light weight and can fit on the back seat or trunk of a medium sized car when folded. I would have given it four and a half stars instead of four. The half star I would take off is for the chair's propensity to make horrible (but easily removable) black scuff marks on vinyl floors. Otherwise, no complaints."
3,Wheelchair - Amazon,"Good quality, sturdy. A little heavier than other wheel chairs used. Arms on chair can flex and rub on wheels slightly."
5,Looks Good,"I ordered the chair and was advise it would be delivered in about a week. Three days later it came. It looks stronger than the chair I have been renting. Wheels nicely. No marks on the wood, vinal or carpet floors. The arms & legs are easy to remove. Folds nicley. We will see what its like after we use it awhile."
5,Great buy,"My wife tires very easily. I bought this wheelchair so that we could go to food stores,malls, etc. I am a senior citizen and have a mid size car. I have to remove the leg supports but I do not have any other problems with putting in my trunk. I was surprised at how well this wheelchair was made. I did not expect this level of quality for the price. My wife told me that it was the best Christmas gift she has received in years. It returned her mobility."
2,Capacity may be incorrect,"I purchased this chair from Amazon.com. In generalI agree with the positive points of other reviewers.This chair is offered by a number vendors on Amazon.I purchased this particular item because thecapacity is specified as 300 pounds. Most of the""similar"" chairs have a 250 pound capacity specified.My chair is clearly marked on the lower support rodas having a capacity of 250 pounds. Hopefullythis particular listing has a ""typo"" error and is nota deliberate attempt to defraud the buyer.I would have given this a 5-star rating if it were notfor the capacity specification problem. I would returnmy unit and get a different one, but I can't trust thecapacity specification so what would be the point?I would probably end up with the same problem afterpaying more money."
1,"Chair seems good at first, then falls apart!!","I loved this chair at first in comparison to what I had! My health insurance company had been renting me a chair and I hated it! I tried to get them to exchange it and bring me a better one, but they wouldn't. The ins company was paying a fortune for it as a rental. I saw this chair and ordered it right away. It got here fast, was exactly as described, and the quality was way better than my old rental, or so I thought at first! It rolled smooth and straight, folded and loaded easily into the car, and maneuvered well even on carpet. I have been in a wheelchair since I was in a car accident 4 months ago, and it's only a temporary condition, but having a nice chair would've made life a little easier. After having the chair for a few weeks, it began to disappoint me. The quality was not good after all. I sent the chair back, and I did NOT even receive full value. I would NOT recommend!"
4,dissapointed,the WHEELCHAIR WAS MORE THAN I HOPED FOR EXCEPT THE ELEVATEDLEG RESTS WERE NOT IN THE BOX . I NEEDED THAT MORE THAN ANYTHING SEEING MY HUSBANDS SURGERY WAS FOOT RELATED. I GIVE THE SHIPPER -10 SINCE THE PACKAGE CAME VERY BADLEY TORN UP AND TAPED EVERYWHERE WHICH IS WHAT MIGHT HAVE HAPPENED TO THE LEG RESTS.I WAS ALSO DISSAPOINTED THAT THEY COULD NOT HAVE JUST BEEN SENT OUT WHEN I CALLED WITH THIS PROBLEM OF MISSING LEGS. I WAS TOLD I HAD TO RETURN THE WHEEL CHAIR. THEY COULD NOT SEND LEG RESTS WHICH I NEEDED. IT WAS VERY HARD FOR ME TO PACKAGE UP THIS WHEELCHAIR MOSTLY BECAUSE THE BOX WAS SO DESTROYED ALSO I HAD TO GET IT TO A UPS DROP OFF. AND I AM NOT A VERY STRONG OR BIG WOMAN AND MY HUSBAND COULD NOT HELP ME BECAUSE OF HIS SURGERY.
1,useless merchandise,"this wheelchair was mispaportion in it's parts, the seat was sunk in and too short, spent the last of my money on it after I had through away the old one that had broken."
5,Great Product,"I bought this product for my daughter after an ATV accident that crushed her femur and left her unable to walk or bend her leg for months and had to keep her leg elevated. It is very well built and very sturdy. It is not too heavy to lift into the trunk, although a bit awkward. I would recommend this product to anyone needing a well built wheelchair for a great price.Pros: Sturdy, well built, elevating leg rests, folds up and fits into the trunk of a car, everything is detachable.Cons: None"
1,Crap!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I ordered two of these chairs and both were returned due to damage. In both cases, the mags were broken and the handrails were split in several places. I will never buy a product made by American Bantex or EVA Medical Group. It is absolute garbage!"
4,good,sturdy and dependable. It worked great to push around my injured mother. Maneuvers well both inside the house and outside.
2,Poor tires,"This is a very nice wheelchair EXCEPT for the tires.Wheelchair arrived assembled but tires were off rims. We took chair to a bike shop where tires were applied to rims. Approximately, a week later a tire came off rim while chair in use and again had to be replaced. A second and more annoying problem with the tires is the black marks left on flooring everywhere the chair is used. The problem is the tires as the chair is only used in the house. Marks are on all types of surfaces,i.e linoleum, tile, carpet ."
4,Wheel chair,"I broke my ankle and I needed something besides crutches. My doctor wrote me a prescription for a wheelchair, but,by the time I would have paid rental fees for 3 months it was easier to buy my own. This wheelchair is well made. It fits thru my doorways since it is smaller than another kind of wheelchair. It is for persons that are not real large, just the weight limit under the 250 lbs shown on the product. It is lightweight, and the leg extensions are good for me. I am only 5'4 so it works for me. I believe someone too tall would not work as well. It has a 5 yr warranty on it and I have a leg extension with a crack in the plastic. The company has been real helpful in replacing it.Getting around my house it this has saved me a lot of wear and tear on my body. Of course, we all know either way crutches or a wheelchair is hard for any age.I am happy with this product."
2,Cheap but not worth it,"I got this as a present for my wife... simply put - it was not worth the money. It barely holds a charge, lame interface, very poor quality."
1,The same key opens,"At auto parts store, I suprised that the same key could open two different locks... there is nothing more to say..."
1,Junk,"""Advanced Security"" is all a lie. These locks can be easily opened without a key. I have written to the Masterlock company and they replaced the lock free of charge to a one that uses a regular key."
3,Don't expect much and you won't be disappointed,"If you plan to buy this thing, be realistic. It's $17 from Amazon and $20 from Walmart. It's solid steel, yes...but the lock is a joke. You can see that just by looking at it and by putting the key in. Even without a pick of any kind, thieves can still just cut the steering wheel in additional places until they get it out. Pull one side out and the other goes, so you really only have to mutilate half of the wheel. It may require more cuts than the standard Club design though.Knowing all of this, I still purchased this and use it sometimes. Just as with locking the doors and engaging the steering wheel lock, it's part of a series of easily erected barriers that are designed to deter casual idiots and delay the serious professionals.As always, the best security strategy is a layered one. A solid car alarm, a tracking service like Lojack, a kill switch, etc are other parts of the equation that should also be considered."
1,It's a wimp,"I had high hopes for this grill cleaner, but the motor is so weak that is just spins and doesn't clean a thing.A complete waste of money! (I've also tested the new larger model at a store and it too is very weak)"
1,Good for about 3 cleanings...,"I also received this as a Christmas gift and just recently unboxed and used it. It was better in the box. The motor randomly stops which requires shaking an/or whacking (gently of course - wouldn't want to damage the delicate thing) along with turning it on and off repeatedly. Then, after about 3 uses, the brush kept spinning off the spindle at which point I put it back in the box and into the circular file in the garage. Too bad my relative spent good money for this junk!Cordless Power Grill Brush"
1,Under ZERO on a scale of 1-10,"This ia a sorry excuse for someone to sell that is supposed to be so great. It is nothing but a rip-off. As soon as you touch the grill to clean the motor stalls, then the brush is used and cannot be returned."
2,So-So,"I bought this for my dad for Father's Day. He said it was OK, but not great. It doesn't get the grime off very well & the power behind it is poor. It' not as good as we thought it would be, especially after seeing the raves it got on TV, like Good Morning America.I wouldn't purchase it again, if I had to do over."
1,Weak Motor,Waste of money. Do yourself a favor and get a regular brush. The motor is so weak you still have to press down and scrape to get this to work. It is much easier to use a brush without a battery.
3,8 AA batteries,"My wife just picked up one of these for me at Marshall's for USD 14.99. Just wanted to let folks know that it requires (8) AA batteries. It does do a good job of cleaning, as long as you don't let the grill get too bad before cleaning. I also clean while the grill is still hot."
1,made in china junk,bought these for christmas gifts and was ashamed of my broke college self. these couldn't clean my nails let alone a grill.
3,"Swing Era, Stan Kenton","I didn't realize that these were various films instead of a concert. However, I was pleased with this 40's material containing tracks from Charlie Barnet and Les Brown also.Hard to come by material this old."
2,Not what I expected,"This DVD was purchased by a Kenton fan. Kenton's band was intertwined with a short subject, thereby reducing the full effect of this orchestra. The inclusion of other big bands mimimized Kenton's exposure to a fraction of this DVD."
2,Don't buy it for cigar lighting,"This product was recommended to me as a cigar lighter. I regret buying it, as the flame barely stays lit; even in a still room! Outside, it is virtually useless. Also, the child safety on it makes it even more annoying to use since I'm constantly re-igniting it. There has to be better products out there - don't make the same mistake I made!"
1,Did not work and was a waste of money - sorry,I had used one of these types of lighters in the past and they are great for candles where the wick is difficult to reach. This one never worked and the mechanism was very challenging. Some kind of rocking motion was required. Threw it out as the gas seemed to leak as well.
2,A Mis-fire,"Upon receiving this small pocket torch I was very happy with the way it performed. Exceptionally hot flame and seemed to be working fine. A short time later it wouldn't even ignite. I wish that I could say that it was over-used or abused and therefore it failed but unfortunately this isn't the case. After light usage, the torch simply won't work. I used the best gas available for these to no avail. I enjoyed it and was very pleased at first but having stopped working in such a short time I have to say that although this is a good idea, it simply doesn't hold up."
2,horrible product,This product worked fine for the first 20 lights then the next 10 lights you have to flick the lighter at least 15 times to finally get it to ignite. It gets worse and worse as far as flicks to get it to light. I just got off my deck and I counted 20 flicks and finally it lit. The butane level is almost 3/4 full and still I have no idea why it still won't light. I will be returning this product as soon as possible. I thought paying this price would give me a reliable lighter on the golf course and in heavy winds but all it has brought to me is frustration and dismay. I hate this lighter with every ounce of being that I contain and everything it stands for. Give me my Ronson or Bic and this lighter can rot in hell!
1,way overpriced,Id had several of these identical lighters and paid less then ten dollars for them. This price us absolutely insane for a lighter. You can get a nice gold torch lighter for this price. I cant believe anyone would pay this much money for a little plastic lighter.
3,NOT AS GOOD AS ORIGINAL VERSION,"not as good as the previous ones.i have one for ten years and it works better than the new versionquality has been lowered and it does not light on the first flick.i would not buy this lighter againboth that i bought were red, maybe a problem with that color."
2,Does not last,I have now purchased two of these lighters. Both worked for a few month then quit. I used the correct butane also. I only used them to light my cigars with.
3,Nice While It Lasted,This lighter worked very well for a few months. Now when I press the ignitor the flame flicks on for 1-2 seconds and then goes out.
2,Not the greatest lighter,"The lighter worked well when I just received the product (just not windproof at all), but after a while, it'll lit up but get blown out for no reason, lasting less than a second. I had to turn the lighter upside down to start it and then turn it straight for it to work. Quite a waste, though the blue flame looks great."
2,Dissapointed again,"I have bought a few of these over the years and each time something has gone wrong with the injectors putting out the butane. I even bought a case of Blazer fuel which is triple refined but eventually the injectors get clogged and the lighter ceases putting out any butane.The last one I bought stopped working just a month or two after the purchase and I won't buy another one again; I don't know what happened to quality of these lighters but this USED to be a good product. The first one I owned lasted a long time and never failed me; but I lost it during a hiking trip and none have worked that well since.I would have once recommended this to anyone and everyone, but now I would suggest buying a butane torch from Harbor Freight instead of this.Thanks,"
2,It was great then it stopped working,"I bought this lighter after reading some rave reviews here and other places. I wanted a no frills bulletproof lighter I even went with the clear so I could always easily see how much fluid was in it. I used the lighter for cigar lighting mostly. I only ran vector butane. The lighter worked for a couple weeks then it failed. It would not light most of the time and then not at all. I liked the idea, strong flame large fuel capacity durable design. You can find a lot of different variations of this style torch lighter but if its not going to be bulletproof guaranteed why waste 30 bucks. You can try your luck on a 5 dollar version. For what it is worth I do have a Xikar Element and its been my durable fail safe and would recommend it."
3,Really?!?! $34.00 for a lighter and it doesn't even come with an ounce of butane,Just opened my package and was a bit surprised it did not come with any butane! Its a nice looking product but overall.. I'm disappointed. If you wink at it... it blows out (a bit sarcastic but this is by no means wind resistant) My Bic can take wind better than this thing. My advice is to go to harbor freight and by yourself one for $5.00.
3,Okay Lighter,"It's a nice flame when it gets started, but the lighter false starts pretty frequently. I was also imagining it to be a lot larger than it actually is."
1,Not a good choice!,PROS1. Very hot flame2. Larger tank size for the overall size of the tourch3. Easy to fillCONS1. Flame will only light on highest setting2. Flame often goes out a second or so after lighting3. Flame goes out with even the lightest of breeze4. The flame will go out for no reason from time to time5. The 'stand' for the torch is poorly designed and makes it very hard to keep it levelAt over $30 there is no excuse for such poor quality/design. Please look elsewhere for a quality torch.
1,Piece Of Junk,"After tiring of cheap lighters, I went for this one, after hearing how ""great"" they were. WRONG! After failing to light after 20 or so clicks, it finally lit and then refused to go out. Nothing worked but finally submersing it in water, and leaving it until all the propane vented. Ten weeks of off and on reliability and then kaput. A total waste of good money."
2,Safety feature causes problems,"The new safety feature that requires an upward push on the striking lever before pushing inward causes a significant usability problem, three or more attempts are required to get a flame. The old design worked fine for 15 years.Unhappy."
4,Blazer,"I have owned a couple of these over the years & have only minor complaints. Firstly, the childproof feature comes installed w/out a choice, I had to hacksaw it off! And..I think the colors are nice but they block the remaining fuel in the tank. These are still Made in Japan which is a plus, although I wish they were made in US. The price @ Amazon is $10 less than most cigar sites w/ free shipping!!"
1,"poor manufacturing quality, it wont last a year","I purchased 2 of these 8 months ago, both have fallen apart in pretty much every area that has moving parts. Very poor manufacturing quality, not worth the premium price tag."
2,It is a PB207cr,I ordered the PB207 and received a PB207cr The cr is for child resistant. I am 64 and the CR is too hard to use. If you check Blazers web site you will see that the pb207cr is for home use and the pb207 is for adult use. They tried sending a second one but I still got a pb207cr both times.Steve Haynes
1,Very unreliable,Will not light after one month. Cannot return for warranty unless have saved all of the purchase paperwork. If you want to get one keep all of your paperwork.
1,Not worth this kind of money.,I've had two of these and they are a pain and don't last. The lid comes off in your pocket. The chain will break. The lighter will quit with in a year. Spend the extra money on a good lighter.Almost forgot this thing has a grossly inflated price. You can buy them for 1/3 of this price and even they are not worth the money.
1,no good junk,"do not buy this piece of crap----it worked for 3 days then wont light any ,more pleasae listen to me ok"
4,Very good lighter,"I choice this lighter because I needed more then just a lighter a needed a torch, a reliable torch.Pros: Very well built, and lights every time.Cons: The child safety lock is a bit of a problem but can be removed if you so desire."
4,Good!,"Good album I mean its hott. But could have been better in my point of view. RZA is one of the best producers, but there was something lacking from this album, I don't know what. But its definately a true banger. Pick this one up.#1.Intro#2.B.O.B.B.Y - 8/10#3.Unspoken Word - 7/10#4.Slow Grind African (Skit)#5.Airwaves (Skit)#6.Love Jones - 10/10#7.N.Y.C Everything - 8/10#8.Mantis - 10/10#9.Slow Grind French (Skit)#10.Holocaust (Silkworm) - 10/10#11.Terrorist - 8.5/10#12.Bobby Did It (Spanish Fly) - 7.5/10#13.Handwriting On The Wall (Skit)#14.Kiss Of A Black Widow - 10/10 (R.I.P ODB)#15.Slow Grind Italian (Skit)#16.My Lovin Is Digi - 7/10#17.Domestic Violence - 10/10 (Love It)#18.Project Talk - 6.5/10#19.Lab Drunk - 8/10#20.F*ck What You Think - 10/10#21.Daily Routine - 8.5/10Overall an alright album. Nothing perfect nothing weak, just alright. Cop it!"
5,The Best Album Ever,This is seriously the best album I have ever heard. The beats and lyrics are great. Only RZA can do both so well.
5,"Hands down, the best cd of the year.....mad creative......","This is one of the best cdz I have heard in a long-*** time.The beats hit hard on this cd with ill trackz like N.Y.C. Everything, B.O.B.B.Y., Mantis, and Holocaust.Mind-bendingly awesome lyrics ehance the ill beats. The best lyrics show and prove on songs like N.Y.C. Everything, B.O.B.B.Y., Domestic Violence, Lab Drunk, Holocaust, Kiss of a Black Widow (that's some funny stuff there), Unspoken Word and Bobby Did It.Of the 2 slow songs, Love Jones is the better. However My Lovin' Is Digi grows on you after a while.Truthfully, there is not one bad song on this cd. I was thoroughly impressed. Airwaves and Project Talk could have been classic if they were longer but they are still tight.BOBBY & NYC EVERYTHING are insanely catchy.Peace, buy this cd, it will surprise you. Much love."
5,RZA's solo DOES compete with the best of them,"After listening to this album I was surprised that it was so good. Especially after everyone that I had talked to about the Cd before I bought it said it was horrible. I THINK IT IS GREAT! RZA displays his love for women and a little hate also. His rhymes are phat and his beats, ofcourse are sweet."
3,This is not your average album.,"I picked this up just today and I can't help noticing how much better than the other Wu albums this is. My all-time fav' is ...Cuban Linx, but this one is right there. RZA obviously saved the best beats for his own record. That may be the reason he didn't produce many tracks for Tical 2000. Overall, this is a solid album for Wu heads."
3,Not what it should be!,"Dont get me wrong, I am a diehard Wu fan straight form the grains of Shaolin, But the Rza's CD should be 10x more phat than it is. There is about 3 or 4 really solid tracks. The rest could be better. Besides the fact that every 10 seconds someone says ""Bobby Digital"". Give me a break!"
3,RZA bit Keith,"This album was pretty dissapointing. Some of the beats are very hollow sounding. RZA's lyrics are ill, and there are about six or seven tracks on the album that are classics, as a whole it doesn't quite stand up to what RZA can do. The next Digital album is way better. This whole idea came off as sort of a Kool Keith rip off to me though."
1,A review of this album,"First of all, RZA DID NOT bite Kool Keith at all. Stop buying into what the media tells you, everyone. Kool Keith is a nobody, he couldn't rap his way out of a garbage bag. Kool Keith is the definition of pure wackness while RZA is the best producer that this Earth has ever seen. The Rza has widsom about the truth about the mighty 5 percent nation and can rip anyone in a rap battle."
1,worst wu album EVER ...,"the RZA's megalomaniacal approach to this 'concept' album could have worked if he actually put the time ... no flow, dead, underproduced tracks, repetitive and unfinished. In fact, if i didnt know 'Bobby Digital' (B-O-B-B-Y-D- ..hahah..) was the RZA, id say rzas gotz no talent at all.But, everything else rzas done is on point. stay off the cocaine bobby ..."
4,I expected more,"Ok, I am a hugh wu fan! I don't really know about this album though. I expected more complex lyrics. Like His solo on the latest grave diggaz album. I love love the songs""bobby"" unspoken words"" is the best song for sure cause the beat is so tight! Nyc everything is good cause of meth. that's all I have to say"
3,not bad......,dat song bobby is all good....and some other tight tracks. there's also some skits wit dis girl singing...sounds nuts. its solid...but not as good as i thought a rza album would be.
5,???????whos talkin ish about any of rza's beats,If you cant appreciate the beat on B.O.B.B.Y then your not smokin enough.period.
1,DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!!!,"This is quite possibly the worst WU release ever. All the tracks are boring and unimaginative and nothing on this album even begins to live up to the Wu's Hard-Rap reputation. My advice is that you leave this album alone, but if you like cheesy, slow, boring s**t-hop, then this is probably the album 4 you."
2,?????????????RZA????????,"MY MIND WAS BLANK AS TO WHAT HAPPEN,WHEN I PERCHASE THIS A WHILE BACK....WHEN I WAS ON TAPE'S...SURE I WHENT,AND GOT THE TAPE...NO DISS FOR RZA,,,BUT THE BEAT'S WAS NOT WHAT I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE LIKE,FOR THOSE NICE BEAT'S...HE DID FOR ODB,GHOST FACE,PLUS OTHERS!!!"
2,Digital Dookie,"This album is just too strange for a true Wu-Tang fan to be able to appreciate. RZA is at his best when using a sample-based production style. Tracks like ""Domestic Violence"", although they could be done better, are RZA's bread and butter. This album shows that when RZA decides to create a track without samples, the outcome will dissapoint. He's an arranger, not a musician.Some of the beats sound like someone's little sister sitting at a casio, pounding random keys out of time (and I am speaking about one of my favorite producers of all time here).This album is not Wu-Tang style. Be clear on that if you're thinking of buying. It's RZA experimenting with a new sound. He is in unfamiliar territory now and he'd better find his way home soon."
1,WACK,"RZA is the wackest rapper I ever heard in my life. Him and Mystikal should try the art of flipping burgers. He never flows to the beat. He'll have a hot beat and just mess up the entire song, because he's in his own little world. ""RZA. Listen to the Beat! """
4,RZA Just Keeps Amazing His Fans!!!,"The Rza is just the best writer,producer,and rapper today! The Rza sounds tight in this album. The writing is on in this one! Meth&Rza are tight in NYC Everthing and Killarmy in there songs. If you like pure rapping & beats buy this CD!!!!"
4,good product,I find these containers extremely handy in the kitchen.They also hold up well after several washings in the dishwasher
1,Floppy and not worth it,"Can't understand why folks have rated these highly. I found them floppy and much thinner than others that I have. I returned these, they just aren't worth even at this low price."
4,more junk in the drawer,"This was a impulse item that looked cool. After we got them they sat on the counter for a couple of days so we can stare at them deciding what to do with them. Well, we found one. Instead of pouring salt and spices out of their mega container and killing your recipe, pour it in these nifty little bowls, just in case. hehe. Do you need them? Heck, no! But they are cool little boogers. (What can I get to fill in a little order from Amazon to get FREE SHIPPING!!)"
3,These are tiny.,"I wish I had bought a bigger size ones because this is mainly for garnishes. That is why my rating will be flawed. It is recommended if you do a lot of flavoring in your cooking. Other than the size, this products looks like it will hold up well to microwave, oven, and dishwashing."
1,Don't bother.,"These are way too little, to me they're very impractical, I will probably never use them. Save the money."
4,Use in your RV,We like sauces with many dishes and as we have new RV were looking for something that was unbreakable. If these were a bit bigger would be better for our purposes but still great and quite cost effective.
5,Use them when we cook,These pinch bowls work great for staging your ingredients prior to cooking. I would recommend these to anybody who spends a significant amount of time in the kitchen. They are durable and look great.
5,Great Laundry Cups,I bought these as a gift for my aunt. She uses these silicone pinch bowls as laundry cups. They hold the right amount of detergent and she puts them in the washer with the clothes. The first set that she had lasted for many years and we are only replacing them because they got lost.
1,not necessary,I thought I would love these but I don't. I recommend small glass or plastic bowls instead. These turn over easily and powder sticks to them. I never use them.
4,"Salt well, spice mix, general use. Thumbs Up.","I have had these for almost two years now. Dishwasher safe and easy to use and clean. I always have one half full with kosher salt as my salt well for cooking and general use. I'll make a spice mix and pour it from the mortar into one of these and it's good to use and the colors help you know what is what at a glance.They work, very little wear after two years of use and dishwasher cleaning.Decent bang for the buck."
5,Love them!,"These are fabulous little pinch bowls. I wasn't sure I would really use them too much, but seem to use them often each week. Great for individual portions for drink mixes. Sauces on the side for each person fit well too; such as tarter sauce for fish, soy for egg rolls, ketchup for fries. Handy as well as colorful. My son calls them 'squishy bowls'. Thumbs up!"
5,Great accessory,"We love these tiny bowls for cooking. they are great if you need to prep all your ingredients and then you have them ready to go. Colorful, easy to use and clean."
4,Cute little bowls,"Cute and colorful, I put daily vitamins in them. Or a small amount of dipping sauce for potstickers or tartar sauce for fish."
4,good product,"This is a decent product. It works good for setting out ingredients for a recipe. They are a little too flexible when your washing them, its just a little had to clean. I even use them or dipping sauces and it works pretty good but they are difficult to move from point to point due to the flexibility."
2,More Like a Warm Night in Ballymuir,"I find it hard to really care about prickly Jenna, or her bratty sister, Maureen. The effort to keep Dev's business interest mysterious, just ends up making it uninteresting. Apparently it had something to do with some modern resort or shopping center ruining Ballymuir's charm (and Jenna's restaurant).I really like reading about Ireland, but the characters put me off enough that I couldn't even enjoy some of the descriptions of the country.By page 150, I gave up on the story and flipped ahead trying to find the ""Hot Night"" that was promised. Never did spot it, but I'm sure it's there somewhere hidden in Jenna and Dev's sparring."
1,Left me Cold,"Weary, stale, flat...but apparently profitable. This formulaic second book in Kelly's series leaves one as cold as...well any real night in Ireland would. All there was of depth and promise in the first has fallen sadly short here. With a tiresomely predictable heroine, Jenna, and her inability to leave control of even the smallest detail or greatest pleasure, to the conflicted momma's boy for a hero, Dev, clearly meant to be the Devil, one must wonder what deal the author made that would force such compromise in what could have been a truly rich, deep, and Irish story line. Where ""Last Bride"" excited and inspired, ""Hot Nights"" , just makes the reader cringe in embarrassment for its author, and wonder if the third book, if there is one coming, will be worth the time to read it, or better thrown in the fire to try to generate the heat this book lacks."
3,Too Small - not the product's fault,"I had read some other reviews that implied it would work fine for dogs up to 10 lbs however, this is definitely not the case. When they say ""mini"" they mean like 3 lb kitten size. I needed it for flying with my 10 lb chihuahua and ended up going to walmart and getting a 19"" long carrier for $20. I wish someone had told me that the airlines are somewhat flexible for pet carriers (or at least US Airways was) - I thought they would literally take out a ruler and measure the carrier but it fit just fine even though it was 2 inches longer and 2 inches taller than the airline's stated regulations. Anyway, can't rate the product 5 stars since my dog was too big to even fit in it, therefore I didn't actually get to test the product."
5,Perfect for the road traveller,"We keep this set up all the time. Wally (our 15 lb Maltese/Terrier mix) usually naps on the back of the sofa but occasionally I can't find him and lo & behold, he's in his house! We travel quite a bit by car between our two homes in WA & CA and the fact that this folds flat with a nice zippered carrying case really helps with space in the car. I've added a small fleece pad like (Midwest 40236 36-By-23-Inch Quiet Time Bolster Pet Bed, Fleece) because the mat that comes in it doesn't look very comfortable. We generally use this when staying in a hotel or any place away from home where I need to confine him while out and about. The sides, back & front all have roll-up sides for light and ventilation."
5,LIGHTWEIGHT and Easy to pack,"I like this crate a lot! It's easy to fold up and compact. Lightweight. I bought the XL for my German Shepherd dog. She prefers to sit in it without the faux sheepskin liner on the bottom- this could be because it is summer time. She is crate trained so we had no issues with her chewing it up. Nice crate, good price, can travel very easily. I like the soft carrier it comes with for storage or travel."
3,Petmate Portable dog crates,I borrowed the med. petmate crate to use in the car with my 2 month old lab. Worked great. So I ordered the large petmate crate and I have had it for four days and the zipper broke. Seems to be a problem with this product. So now the fun task of returning it or getting it fixed. They need to use a better quality zipper for as often as you use it.
1,Too bad...,"I bought this product for our toy poodle puppy. It is a nice product, but I am very disappointed that my tiny puppy chewed zipper and broke it in a few days. My 3 pound chewed two spots, and then the zipper doesn't work anymore. How can this product be so weak!? I like the design, and my puppy was so comfortable in there, but it's useless as I can open/close the zipper at all! The company needs to improve the zipper part so that little innocent puppy cannot chew."
1,so disappointed,"We bought this travel crate for our 7-month old puppy to sleep in during vacation. We selected the large size so she could have something to grow into (she's a pit/catahoula mix, so she's going to be a big girl). During our first night, she became startled by something and pushed through the front ""door"" of the crate, pushing through the seam between the net and the zipper. It's now completely unusable.We've have several Petmate metal and portable crates, and I'm absolutely disappointed with the durability of this item. If a 40lb puppy can cause this damage, how secure would a 65lb dog be in the pet home?"
3,FALLS APART,"I ordered the crate because it looked so adorable in the picture. Well it is adorable and fits great in my house, but then after a few uses it ripped open! My suggestion would be to only buy this product if you have an old dog that doesn't like to move around a lot. My 5lb puppy tore through the side in a few days and I've since gone to a hard plastic crate that works well."
5,Great travel crate!,"I bought this for my crate-trained siberian husky while I visited family over the holidays. She loved it! It was easy to pack up and also easy to clean. I wouldn't recommend for a dog that isn't already crate trained, however; it would be easy to chew."
5,Joey loved from the first minute,"Joey, my 17 lb tuxedo cat, could barely contain himself as I set this up -- all of three minutes! He was in it and stayed in it for most of two days because he loved it so much. I am moving cross country and this will be his home in the van, and possibly the nite in the motel. I left it up so he would get used to it. My big concern was this crate big enough for such a large cat to stand and eat and move around a bit. The answer is a resounding yes. It is much more roomy than I even imagined, and zips right together. Love the roll up shades on all sides. There is nothing not to like about this cat castle! Even the colors are lovely."
3,Product is NOT as shown,"This is the first Amazon purchase that's ever disappointed me.Construction of the product is okay, and my shih tzu puppy seems more comfortable after I bought a separate fleece bumper to insert. That said, one of the main reasons I chose this pet home vs. some of the others was b/c I liked the pink & brown color combo shown in the photo. Unfortunately, it is NOT pink & brown. The description says ""khaki/maroon."" It's NOT khaki/maroon either. It's brown/brown. If I had the time, and the packaging wasn't so bulky, I would've returned it."
4,Great portable pet home!,"This is a nice portable home for my 7-lb, 3-month old terrier. I can not only transport him but also carry him into stores when I do quick errands. I love the roll-up ""shutters"" since I roll them up to allow him to see more during the wake up hours, and down to allow more privacy when he takes a nap. I also like it that I can fold it up to pack it in a suitcase if needed. I do agree with others who commented about the zipper and velcro. You probably have to watch your dogs or train them not to chew on those parts; otherwise they will deteriorate pretty quickly. As soon as I noticed my puppy chewing on those I made it clear that those are not OK to chew (offering another toy for distraction). So far he has not touched them again. If you carry the crate a lot I would probably recommend you putting a piece of hard cardboard or something similar on the bottom, as the weight of your dog may sink the bottom of the soft bed."
1,Not good,"I have read other books in the ""Step-by-Step"" series and have been very impressed. This one, however, is terrible. It is poorly written, jumps around, provides way too much detail where isn't needed and too little detail where it is needed.Save your money."
1,Confusing!,"I got high hopes for this book before purchasing it based on some high reviews, and I have a fair understanding of dataset and how datarelations work. I was actually looking for an insight on how to use manipulate data and bind them to controls using ADO.NET's datarelation and binding manager, but I got confused some more after browsing thru the pages of this book.This is not a book for beginning ADO.NET enthusiasts, as you'll get nothing from this book. Try other titles and if you find a better one please advise us readers.Thanks"
1,Disappointing,"I found this to be a disappointing resource. Every time I wanted an example of a method or function, I looked in the index, went to the page noted, and found a grid with the list of exposed properties, methods, etc. No concrete examples there. To me, this was little more than the MSDN help files bound between two covers.I'm in the midst of writing code, and this book was no help, so I didn't bother to finish it because it didn't seem like a good use of my time. Maybe if you're learning from scratch it would be a good tool??? I will try the advanced ADO.NET book from Microsoft. Perhaps I just chose the wrong book.On the plus side, the book did include both VB and C# code and the author was very clear in her writing."
3,Attaching sample database works fine,"Not sure why Mr. Veeneman was unable to attach the MDF file. The sample database attached just fine for me. When you run the ConfigDB.exe utility, the LDF file is automatically created."
3,Leftovers from Rabin's previous works...,"An entertaining score, but Rabin has just used the main theme from 'Deep Blue Sea' and has added a touch of Armageddon to it. Thrown in are exact cues from 'Enemy of the State' remastered with some of Hans Zimmer's 'Power of One' kind-of chants. Track 4 seems like a lighter version of Armageddon's Launch track and Track 5 sounds exactly like Enemy of the State's Track 6 on the score CD.I mean this is an entertaining score. But the tracks won't last forever. The genius ability that he showed in 'Armageddon' is definitely not in show here.Only for the 'score-beginners' or 'Rabin's fans'..."
4,Works great,"I've had one of these installed in bathroom for the past year. It works great. I'm not sure about the other reviewer who commented on noises since mine doesn't make any noise at all.My only complaint is that the switch toggle is skinny (more like a thin blade when compared with traditional light switches). The thin toggle feels a bit flimsy, but it hasn't broken and I don't think it will so it's just more of an impression I get when turning the switch on/off."
5,"Great Switch, great service",The switch I had was no longer made so I changed to the Air King delay timer switch. I have been very happy with the product and the delivery service was on time and as stated.
2,Not for GFCI branch!,"I bought two of these timers. One was for a shower vent/light that is part of a Ground Fault Circuit Disconnect (GFCI) branch. The timer on this GFCI branch blows the disconnect after 3 or 4 switch operations. I found no declaration that this was a known situation in any of the descriptions. I wired the switch to a simple light fixture and it still blew. I traded the two timers positions to see if it was the design or just bad luck on the individual unit. It still blew, so it is the design.If you are controlling anything on a GFCI branch, get a different timer!Air King AKDT60 Delay Timer Switch, White"
3,Description of operation is a little confusing,"The switch installs into a standard light switch box fine and the instruction were easy to understand.The first unit I received did not work correctly and they promptly sent me a replacement with no hassles except they never actually told me that the replacement had been sent.The switch is really has two functions:On/Off with a single load wire.On/Time delay off on a second load wire.After reading the description of operation, I assumed that I could over-ride the timer and turn everything off (when we brush our teeth instead of a shower, for example). Unfortunately, the timer is always in the circuit so whatever is connected to the second load wire will run every time the switch is turned off."
3,Be careful,"In spite of one of the above reviews, this switch will not turn the fan off at a preselected interval if the switch is not turned off. Only turning the switch off activates the timer. For showers or when you want a delay after turning the switch off, it's great. For powder rooms (people forget to turn the switch off) it's useless."
1,doesn't keep fizz in the can,as far as keeping bees out of your drink i suppose it would work but i bought this to keep the fizz in and it didn't work. one of the lids didn't even fit correctly. plus i am annoyed that i had to pay more for the shipping than the actual product. this is a waste of money.
2,Don't fit,My favorite drinks are Pepsi and Dr. Pepper. These lids do not fit either one. They are too loose and just fall off.
1,Arrived broke,"These arrived broken. The package popped over. The toppers appear very flimsy, as well as the packaging. Amazon packaged it well on their end. It was just the product was so cheap it broke before I even got it."
4,How to help your children avoid entitlement,"If you teach your children how to be financially responsible between the ages of 4 and 18, you have a much higher probability of having them not back at home living with you between the ages of 22 and 35."
4,Silver Spoon Kids,"Great book to help you raise happier, better adjusted children. But it is also about helping you with you own issues around money. It is not a book just for the wealthy. It is for anyone with a moderate degree of affluence."
1,ITS A JOKE... isnt it?,"ok when blink said that the new cd is called use your erection v. 1+2, they were joking. it has NO TITLE. its just blink 182. i dont even think this is a real cd. japan doesnt have a dofferant title, the only bonus version (i know of, as of yet) is a U.K version with a bonus song called ""not now"". and the bonus dvd was originally planned, but it changed to just an enhanced cd. this was a JOKE. i think it was... i will find out. actually if you wanna know more about it join the yahoo group ""spauldingstreehouse"", its run by chris georggin, blink's assistant manager. he will answer any questions you have. but i really dont think this is real. thats it, the end."
1,Very Weak Fragrance,"As a teenager I used Jade East Cologne exclusively and loved it. Then it disappeared, until this product re-emerged. This is not the same Jade East Cologne that I loved. It is mostly alcohol and the fragrance is very weak and does not last long. If you like an inexpensive cologne with a similar fragrance, I suggest trying Brut, which is much more concentrated and lasts all day."
2,Bait and Switch,"To say that I am disappointed would be an understatement. The items that I ordered and were pictured, on the order page, were by Songo not Regency. This not the same product I have used for years. To further complicate this issue, there is no return on the deliverd Regency items and the return label had been removed from the delivery package."
1,Never Received Item,"I never received the Songo Jade East cologne. When I emailed and asked why, I never got an answer. Not happy at all about this!"
5,Build ya a fire,"This is what I like to call Country music. Now I really enjoy all country music, but this music reminds me of my rodeo days. To see Chris die at such a young age just puzzles me, but knowing that he accomplished so much in his music I think it's fair to say he lived a really great life. This music is wonderful and I love to take it with me camping!"
4,Anthology Volume 1,"Now, if your LeDoux fan, your going to rate this 5 star because it IS pure LeDoux, the cowboy songs, the rodeos, the west. I love the theme of the songs, but to be truthful, if you are music critic, or one of those modern western rockabilly lovers, LeDoux may not be your favorite. For that reason I give it four stars. But the album is good, has most of his best songs (keeping in the thought I like the theme.) Keep in mind LeDoux is no longer with us, so count this as a classic."
5,A great collection,"My heart breaks when I think this wonderful, talented songwriter is no longer with us. Thank you for keeping his songs alive. There was and always will be only one voice like Chris. I highly recommend this album, telling it like it is in the Rodeo Life. Rest in Peace Chris. Deb"
3,Not quite what I was expecting....,I can say the product did come in a timely manner however it was not in a package like shown on the web page. I find this a little concerning. Displaying a toy in original packaging then shipping in bubble wrap with NOTHING but the carbonite piece and Han Solo....I was a little disappointed--I mean THIS IS A CHRISTMAS GIFT THAT LOOKS LIKE IT WAS PLAYED WITH BY TONS OF LITTLE BOYS BEFORE I TRY TO REWRAP AND REGIFT IT?!?!
5,Classic Star Wars Must-Have,I am using this toy to make a candy mold. Han-Solo in carbonite is such a classic Star Wars image. It doesn't have much in the way of cool features (Solo clips into the back of the block of carbonite and he has a gun) but he's nice to look at.
2,Doesn't work,"I received the camera in July but didn't try to use it till September. No damage to package, no reason to believe it wouldn't work. Followed instructions to insert battery (tested--it works) and card, but when I push button to turn on, it doesn't. Since it's my first digital camera, I consulted two friends who are more familiar with them; it didn't work for them either. Screen display doesn't come on. Tried taking it to a camera store but was told I'd have to send it to manufacturer. Probably a good camera if I hadn't gotten a lemon."
4,intermediate-beginners,I found many of the songs I was looking for in this book. I did not find some of the more recent/rock songs that I would have liked to play. The difficulty of the songs was just right for me....most were of the beginner and intermediate level of difficulty.
3,"good book, but don't buy to use with Big Book of Violin solos","Nice selection of songs. Although one would think that ""the companion book"" mentioned in the blurb would be ""The Big of Christmas Songs (piano-guitar)"", not too many of the violin songs are in ""The Big Book"" and many of them are in a different key, so don't buy it expecting many accompaniments."
4,Great variety!,This book has a great variety of Christmas songs . . . religious and secular. I would recommend it to anyone who needs or wants an all-purpose Christmas collection. I would rate the level of difficulty as easy.
4,No title,"Is an excellent book with loads of different Christmas songs you can play with you're instrument, i encourage you to get one if you really like to play christmas songs :)"
4,Good deal for the money,"There are tons of songs this book. It has some of my favorite songs, like Carol of the Bells, Oh Christmas Tree, etc. However, about 70 or 80% of the songs I've never heard before. I think they are ""old school"" songs with common melody. So, I'd say I really enjoyed about 20% of the songs, but the remaining 80% left something to be desired. I'm not a super piano player, but I'd say only a few songs were challenging to play, some songs were very simple, but most in the simple to average range."
3,Too many special guests,"I have been an Elton fan for three and a half years now and have enjoyed his previous live performances. Here and There, Live in Australia, 11-17-70, and the Barcalona video. This recording however just sounds like a big recreation of the studio works. I recently did see Elton in concert along with Billy Joel and the two piano men were f#$king great that night, but this night had a major lack of intensity. Elton keeps bringing out guest after guest after guest and this gets annoying fast. I bought this album for Elton and not for Billy Joel( I still love his music don't get me wrong) or for Ronan Keating or for Mary J. Bleige and sorforth. I suggest that if you want a copy of this, go to a used CD store and get from there for a lot cheaper, this album just didn't cut it."
2,one listen only,"A made for tv mishmash of good to great songs trampled by guest ""stars"" and nobodies, many sung a half step lower so Elton can hit the notes. Who the heck is ""Anastacia"" and why do I care? This is another poor effort.I love the guy -- seen him 50+ times -- but skip this one and buy any of the other live records (Australia, 11-17-70, especially Here & There) for the real deal.How about some archived live shows from '76 or '77, the '79 and early '90's solo shows with Ray Cooper, or the '95 shows at the Garden? Any of those would be terrific."
2,WHERE IS THE REAL ELTON??,"Although there is a bunch of great Elton's early classics and also the sound of the band is really big, Elton's voice is depressing!! Even his outfits do not remember the great 70's and early 80's Elton John's, I mean the personality that he used to transmit on stage. That hairstyle he's wearing is ridiculous!! But the mean problem is about his voice. Elton has better live albums, such as ""Here and There"" or ""17-11-70"". Sorry, for me this one can go directly to the trash can."
3,Voice has gone....,"I am a big fan of Elton, but as he has aged, he voice has left him. He often evades high notes--he sings much lower than he used to and he is not as smooth. These are the songs we all love, but for me, I enjoy earlier recordings much more."
2,Also . . .,"Contrary to earlier reviews1) Nigel is NOT AUDIBLE on this record -- the main drummer was some guy named Curt.2) ""Candle in the Wind"" was a big international hit as a remake in 1986."
3,A big disappointment from a long awaited live set,"I have long been an Elton John fan, from the first time I heard ""Rocket Man"", but as the creativity and quality of his music has diminished in the last 5+ years, this live set fits in with that trend. Particularly annoying is the overuse of 'guest' vocalists, who, in my opinion, hog the spotlight. It's great to see Nigel Olsson back as drummer, which thrilled me! To hear him playing once again with Elton and Davey Johnstone was almost like old times and I really wished the late Dee Murray (bass) could have joined this. All criticisms aside, the cuts that ARE pure Elton are classic performances and a joy to listen to, especially his re-teaming with Kiki Dee after 25 years! Although not his best live album, if you are an Elton John fan and collector, as I, you defininitely want this--just ignore the intruders."
4,Takes Time,"When I first listened to this CD I was very disappointed. He didn't hit the high notes like I remembered. Listened to it once and then put it on the shelf. Later I received the DVD of this concert as a gift and after ""watching"" the concert, I learned to like this CD too."
5,1 NEW ELTON FAN,"Ok, I must admit the only reason why I bought this cd is because of Mary J. Blige. I'm a huge Mary fan and when I saw her perform with Elton, I was blown away. Previously, the only thing I knew about Elton was that Mary J.'s huge hit ""Deep Inside"", in which Elton played piano on her 1999 release ""Mary"" was sampled from Elton's ""Bennie and the Jets"", which let me say is one of the phattest beats in music today. Anyway, after listening to the whole album, I immediately set my cd player to repeat. The whole energy of the cd is like none I've ever heard (of course except Mary's ""Tour"" album). I am very satisfied with this cd and now, I can say I'm an Elton fan (thanks to Mary J. Blige)."
2,Also . . .,"Contrary to earlier reviews1) Nigel is NOT the primary drummer on this record -- in fact you can't hear him at all. It's someone named ""Curt"".2) ""Candle in the Wind"" was a big US and international hit as a remake in 1986."
2,seems rushed,Elton John is a great talent but like many other great talents for whatever reason he gets caught making safe product&this is no exception to the rule.Live this is worth checking out but to have to hear him being paired with others&just making by the numbers product does him an injustice.His Talent should be about challenging his craft not doing what he could do in his sleep.
3,Had hopes of using it for our homeschooling...but won't be,"Overall, as others have said, the story is a good one. I had hopes of using it as a read aloud for our ancient history studies this year. However, there is a bit of language and unnecessarily graphic violence in it, so I will pass on it."
1,Terrible toy,"I bought this for my almost 3-year-old son for Christmas and had to return it after he played with it once. Like the other reviewer said, the hammer started breaking immediately--but even worse, the nails were completely impossible to remove after my son hammered them in partway. Neither my husband or I could remove them (or the people at the store where I returned it)--making it impossible to fold the bench and making the toy pretty much worthless. What were the manufacturers thinking?"
1,Not worth the trouble,"This toy is not worth the money! You can't really hammer or screw any of the pieces without adult help. Once you hammer the piece in, you can't get it out. When you screw in the screws, you have to hold a piece under the bench, which of course, a child can't do. It is also very heavy for a little one to move around and the pieces will fall out since there is no storage. What a huge disappointment."
4,MORRISSEY At KROQ : nice,"a quick run of three great tracks in the studio back in 1991. KROQ has always been a supporter of Moz and it's great to hear these live versions. ""There's A Place In Hell For Me And My Friends"" ditches the lonley piano for a decidedly more upbeat version and both ""My Love Life"" and ""Sing Your Life"" are performed well and are quite lovely. a nice little treat for fans."
4,Smashingly good Morrissey EP,"The only thing that I would change about this EP if I could would be to make it longer. Morrissey's renditions of these three great songs of his left me wanting to hear more of the same!Most EPs and CD singles have only one or two songs that you can't get on a regular album. ""Morrissey at KROQ"" has three different versions of three of his songs, versions that you can't find anywhere else. The style is unlike anything else that you will hear in Morrissey's other work. ""KROQ"" has a very old-style rock sound to it, with an old stand-up string bass on the bass line, while the other musicians are busy with newer harmonies. Especially on ""Sing Your Life,"" the tempo is quite upbeat.This EP really gives us a side of Moz that you don't hear much of outside of his concerts."
3,I Believe review.,I love Jimmy Fortune but I did not like the way some of the songs were arranged. There was a couple of songs on there that was the reasons I ordered the cd and I liked them a lot. The song I Believe was the main one. I cry every time I hear it as it is so fitting for me. Just thought as a whole it could have been better.
1,Disappointed,Did I like it ? Not much.Very disappointed in the way he sings on this cd.I would NOT recomend .... but thats just my openion of a guy who has the voice of an agle most of the time .... not this time for me.
1,Not the Waterford you know,"This glass is made in Slovenia and NOT Ireland. That wouldn't matter, but it's not the same quality and DOES NOT MATCH my existing glasses. The glass is thicker, and doesn't have the same crystal chime. The cuts are shorter and look more stamped than cut with softer, rounded edges. The rim is thicker and the shape slightly more squat."
5,Delicious and gluten free!,Excellent product for those on a wheat free diet. Have a hamburger again with a REAL bun! Even better if you microwave for 20 seconds prior to eating. Enjoy!
3,Great idea...,"I'm not sure why Ener-G isn't making their buns with the light bread recipe?This was thick and HAS to be toasted before use. My husband would go to Burger King, order our food, and a hamburger patty for our daughter. I'd toast these in the oven, and she could eat a hamburger like us...I'd put one in my purse if we were going to leave the house & go out to eat...They aren't that good after they have cooled off. My daughter would eat a little of the bun, and then just eat the meat. The bread tastes fine... Just a little too thick..."
1,Moldy Upon Reciept,Four of the six packs of buns were moldy when I recieved the order and had to be thrown away.
1,Dry as a bone,Even when heating these they taste horrible. Mine arrived already dried out. When removing them from the package they were cracked and crumbly. My sons who are Celiacs almost cried. They miss hamburger buns so badly and I thought with the reviews I saw that these were the answer for them.Both are six years old and both practically gagged on the texture and taste.. all around just plain bad. Even our dog wouldn't eat them and he eats just about everything.. he sniffed them and walked away.. That says it all right there.
3,Microwave covers,The covers do the job but the large one does not lay flat during cooking. The heat changes it just a bit. I expected the covers to lay losely flat but they still do the job and keep food from splattering all over the microwave.
3,Works well,"These work well but I only gave a 3 star because one was stuck to a pot and caught on fire on the burner. They can be very sticky and stick to cups, plates etc... too"
5,Convenient idea!,"Simple idea. Replaces limp, wet pieces of waxed paper or plastic wrap. Protects the inside of the microwave from splatters and traps steam for easy cooking.Cleans in dishwasher.My only wish is that there was a larger one in the set."
3,it works but i ended up not using them,"This works. But this became another thing to hold on to then set aside when taking out foods/drink from the microwave, another thing to wash, another thing to look for and manuever (depends on container) when preparing food to microwave ... The issues are very, very minor and not at all big deal but, for convenience sake, I ended up going back to using paper towel or paper plate (the thin & cheap kind) to cover my foods when microwaving."
2,Only good for heating water,"This product warped right away, although it straightened out somewhat in the dishwasher. The microwave fan kept knocking it off the cup or bowl and if anything in the bowl exploded (like carrots do in soup) it knocked it off too."
1,MAJOR disappointment-waste of money,"I can't believe anyone found these covers to be effective - makes me wonder if the reviewers are ""plants"" from Norpro. Like the previous reviewer a few days ago, I think they are worthless. Upon using each of the different sizes, they immediately curled up. This causes them to blow off of the food the majority of the time (from the micro's fan, I'm guessing)and just lay on the turntable. This is due to the gap that now exists when the cover is lying across the container and is curled up instead of lying flat. The whole purpose of these was to safely cover food to prevent splattering within the micro and to help contain the heat - they do NEITHER! WHAT a waste of time and money. I can't believe the positive reviews below. Just doesn't make sense unless the plastic was of a different grade. I'm going to return these."
2,Sounds like a good idea...,"I also bought this set so I wouldn't be using disposable plastic wrap or waxed paper to cover dishes in the microwave. But, if you use them to heat up soup - or anything that you want to get really hot - they get permanantly pock marked (like a plastic bowl does when heating up spaghetti sauce). And they warp."
1,Worthless,"Steam and heat from the food below cause the flimsy covers to fall off, making them entirely worthless."
1,"Nice idea, bad product","This looks like a great product, but it is a piece of junk and does not work. I read other reviews how it doesn't lay flat, but thought I'd give it a try for a few bucks. Don't waste your money - it doesn't work. Because it doesn't lay flat and rolls, food splatters out the sides. Not even work the space it takes up in the cupboard. It they sent it to you for free, it wouldn't be worth it. Amazon should remove this product from their store."
1,Horrible product - Warps when heated,"I am surprised that anyone who gave this product a rating of more than a 2 ever actually used it.The covers curl up when heated making them useless, unless you weight them down with a saucer or other heavy object. Hardly convenient. Once warped they do not flatten, making them worthless for the purpose intended.A frustrating product that was obviously never tested for its intended purpose. It makes me wonder if they are even safe to be used around food."
3,dazzling,"Texas' Joe Ely has pumped out 14 albums of material since he made his debut in 1977. But as this latent collection of his greatest illustrates, his best stuff was recorded early on with chief songsmith Butch Hancock on board. Songs plucked from the first four albums dazzle with crackerjack playing, muscular vocals and a goldmine of material (Suckin' a Big Bottle of Gin, Tennessee's Not the State I'm In, West Texas Waltz, Standing at the Big Hotel) straight from Hancock's pen. Even Ely, unpressured, was able to dash off the sporadic gem (Honky Tonk Masquerade, Fingernails). But only the deaf will miss the stylistic decline which set in after Hancock bolted in 1981. Forced to rely on his own material, Ely's focused changed and the spark in the studio all but disappeared. Only a rousing live version of Hancock's If You Were a Bluebird, recorded in 1990, makes the case for any late-career relevancy and only then because Ely's true value is the work he does on stage."
2,Disappointment,"The author certainy had a good idea for the book, ie reconnecting with his estranged father through their common love of gardening, but his execution of the idea really missed the point. He instead chose to mostly write an autobiography in which he made that fatal error common to many autobiographists in assumming that his life minutiae was of the same interest to to others that it was to him. The result is a suprisingly bad book. Given the author's carreer as a journalist, it is really surprising that his book is so unfocused and of such little interest."
3,funky live tunes,"Nice cd full of live performances by Charlie Wilson of the Gap band, The Barkays, SOS Band. Live performances that won't be found elsewhere to my knowledge. Recordings are clear, played it at a party, people loved it."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"Images Work. This Book Doesn't.Of the 25+ marketing books I've read in the past 9 months, this one takes bottom honors.The authors of this book are the type who would take instructions on how to make a microwave dinner, and turn it into a 35 page treatise.Going on and on and on describing every nuance of the tests they did, speak in a nearly unreadable 'scientific tone' that gones on ad-infinitum in detail about useless information.I shouldn't need to read 40 pages about a study they conducted, their method, their hypothesis, etc. etc., just to get the final conclusion: images, as we expected, do in fact have an impact on people.Duh.The conclusions of this book should have been summarized in a pamphlet entitled ""things you already guessed, but that we decided to test"".Authors, I have a request: get to the damn point.I regret the $90 I spent on this terrible book that will join ""Propaganda"" in my dust bin."
5,Excellent Transaction!!,I was glad to find a replacement toggle head for my Swivel-eze transom saver. The rubber pads had worn off mine and to replace the whole transom saver was $50.00. I bought this replacement toggle head from Amazon. It was easy to replace the worn one and it saved me a lot of money. I experienced a smooth and easy transaction and the item shipped to me relatively fast.
5,The Perfect Find,"The roof vent in my van had snapped off and I was in desperate need of a new vent when I found this treasure. It works even better than my old one, and not only that but it's probably the cheapest one on amazon. The frame is 100% sturdy and reliable, and the lid is totally waterproof. Also really easy to install and operate. This was definitely a great purchase."
3,Looks like there's some confusion,"All the reviews here are for the *Album* which is also called Chorus. (There's also a limited edition of the Chorus album not listed.) But there was also a CD-Single called ""Chorus (Fishes in the Sea)"" which is this product. This is the product I am reviewing.So, you get the album version which everyone knows and is a classic Erasure tune. You get the b-side ""Snappy"" which isn't quite as classic, to put it nicely. You have various mixes of Chorus by Youth, which didn't quite tickle my fancy. Finally you have ""Over the Rainbow,"" which is a great b-side in the synth-pop tradition of Erasure. It's worth it for this tune, and if you don't have Chorus (album version) already, it's a great intro to the Erasure sound."
4,Pretty good but not my favorite,"This set starring Patrick Macnee as John Steed and Diana Rigg as Emma Peel is very funny and holds your attention. This is a classic set, but there is a problem. I find two of these episodes completely boring. The Living Dead and Never, Never Say Die are so boring. The Living Dead is an interesting plot, but the way it was made, they didn't do a good job(in my opinion). Never, Never Say Die has an interesting plot also. It's about substituting some certain people for robots in their place. It's neat, but for 20 minutes or something like that you just keep seeing this robot walking around. The Hidden Tiger, The Correct Way to Kill, Epic, and The Superlative Seven are all very well done. This is a pretty good set, but not my favorite!"
2,Good king bad cd,"The first thing you will notice about this cd is it doesn't have any jazz on it. The songs are all soft rock tunes produced in a very 70's way (funky with a lot of wah wah and phase shifter effects). George plays most of the melodies in octaves (like Wes Montgomery did on his Verve recordings); he doesn't solo as much as you would expect; and horns and violins are added to each song in in the style typical of CTI. Anyway, here is the song list: Theme from Good King Gone Bad, One rock don't make no boulder, Em, Cast your fate to the wind, Siberian workout, Shell of a man, and Hold on I'm comin'. All the songs are instrumental (mostly Dave Mathews tunes), except George sings on the last one. If you want funky 70's dance music, I guess you might like this. If you want to hear what a great jazz guitar player George Benson is, I'd try something else (like one of his earlier albums)."
4,Elegant and solid,"Nice...handsome and pleasing to hold, doesn't seem fragile like many wine glasses. Feels natural holding it by my outdoor grill, yet elegant in the dining room. I ordered one 6-ounce claret goblet to try it out, but the 6-ounce was too small and delicate, and I'm happier with my set of 10-ounce goblets. I prefer this Araglin tulip shape to the barrel-shape of other Waterford goblets."
5,Tight CD,"This is a tight cd, his best one out of all. If you like hard core chicano rap, you will like this cd. This is for la pura Raza. None of his other cds are on this level."
4,The Art of Porco Rosso: Good but should have been great,"I love the movie Porco Rosso.I liked the book a lot. It described where the story came from, and the historical background. It also had a small section describing each character. The most interesting part is where they describe the various backgrounds.There honestly was not that much interesting information.I was expecting for an explanation of the ending of the movie. They didn't even mention the part of the movie where Marco and Curtis fought. They didn't mention that Porco may have became a human again, (because of Gina's love and Fio's kiss, and because Curtis kept asking to see Marco's face after they fought) or whether or not Gina and Marco ended up together. (Porco's plane could be seen in the background)Altogether, the book was good.I am glad that I bought it."
5,Great nonstick utensil that doesn't melt !,"This is a great nonstick utensil. It not only easily handles oversized things like omelettes, large cuts of meats/roasts, etc, besides fish. It also doesn't look like the plastic nonstick utensils that seem to eventually melt in your food. I'll be looking for more of these type of Norpro Non-stick products. I need nonstick which won't scratch up the expensive Le Creuset pots heavily invested in."
4,Not for small frying pans.,"I used it with the 10"" non-stick frying pan, it's difficult to turn the fish and it might scratch the non-stick frying pan. Great for grilling. Good quality. Nice looking."
2,Fish turner,I've only used this a couple of times. It's a clumsy size and tips over and the food falls off of it if its not perfectly centered. It doesn't store in the kitchen very well (nor does it fit well in the dishwasher).
4,World View,"Wheather you like this book or not, depends on you world view. If you believe that there is a God, and that he sent his only begotten son to pay for our sins, and that he rose from the dead, then I you will be openminded about this book. The book aims to give a biblical view on how one should treat children.If, on the other hand you don`t believe there is a God, then I do not think this book will help you in your aim to raise children."
5,A good read for parents,"An excellent christ-centered book on parenting. I think all parents, old & new, could glean some valuable information from this book; whether the information is new, a reinforcement, or maybe something you may have gotten away from doing. Just like kids need reminders from time to time to stay on track, I think parents need the same thing. For those concerned with honoring God in how you raise your children, you should read this book."
1,SENT WRONG SIZE,THEY SENT ME THE WRONG SIZE AND SAID THAT IT WAS NOW DISCONTINUED SO THEY COULDN'T CORRECT THEIR ERROR. BAD BUSINESS!
3,For the true Fan of Dramarama,"If you are looking for this cd then you are a fan of Dramarama, am I right?This out of print/rare cd is from Dramarama just that they released it under the name ""The Bent Backed Tulips"". It's not that good in my opinion but I like the fact that it has 22 songs. Rare, Dramarama, 22 songs. No need to say anything else"
4,Finely we now can have our memories.,"When these albums came out I was 16 years old, I still have the original LPS of these albums on vinyl. I was very dissapointed when the EMI CD's came out because they just did not seem like the same albums I had always played. Now I can have them in great CD sound and hear them in the order I remember. The packaging is a nice improvement on Vol 1. I'm sure I got the first pressing of this and I really do not care, it still sounds great to me. I look at it this way, in about a year it will be a mono mix no one has and a possible collecter item. Looking forward to Vol. 3 now."
3,Stereo fold down on The Early Beatles is okay...,"I keep reading reports that both versions of ""Please Please Me"" are included in this box set, but this is not the case.John gets his vocals wrong in the stereo version of ""Please Please Me"" at 1:27 -- ""He sings 'Why do I' instead of 'I know you'"". The mono version is supposed to be a fold-down from the stereo version, and not like the Please Please Me album version that has no vocal flub-up.Other than the mixup with the mono masters for Beatles VI and Rubber Soul, this set would be great - I really appreciate the stereo versions of most of these, and the remastered sound, even from inferior masters, sounds fantastic.Thanks to those of you who pointed out that The Early Beatles and Help! are correct as is."
3,Parlophone Over Capitol,Sorry but I just got this one & the best thing about it was the artwork. The correct british versions are the ticket if you want to hear The Beatles as nature intended. The steteo versions are a joke but the monophonic versions are pretty good. I recommend the british CD's if your buying Beatles material. (search Judemac at msn)
2,The Capitol Albumn Vol 2 - Beatles,The Capitol Albums Vol. 2 (Brick)This product seemed to have a flaw. A 4 CD set was OK except for the last 3 tracks on CD # 4 which were non-playable due to a defect. The product was returned to Amazon for a full refund.
4,"Once again, Capitol misses the mark","There isn't anything new that could be said about Beatle music that hasn't been said already.What Capitol should've done was concentrate solely on the U.S albums that weren't previously released on CD. This would include the soundtracks with instrumental music for both A Hard Day's Night (which Capitol later acquired) and Help, the documentary Beatles' Story (all four sides can fit on one CD), and Live At The Hollywood Bowl and the fanclub Christmas songs (another whole CD). Together, this would've made a killer 4 CD set.This main attraction here is the Help soundtrack, available here but not as it's own separate CD.Who knows? Maybe someday, someone from Capitol will wise up and release the box set I'm suggesting.One can hope."
1,"One star for Amazon, Booooooo","I ordered my copy after seeing the comment (now removed) on the Amazon page saying that ""we now have all corrected copies"". Liars! I just got mine today and it's the error copy! Now I have to take the time and effort to return it. Beware of buying this from Amazon. Boooooo."
1,Frustrated.....Amazon STILL selling mistake versions of Capitol Albums Vol. 2,"I waited to buy Volume 2 until I saw the disclaimer Amazon had listed about how they now were only shipping a ""correct"" version of this CD with the correct mono mixes for ""Beatles' VI"" and ""Rubber Soul"", so I placed my order. What did I receive? The ""mistake"" version, with the fake mono. If I wanted to go through the trouble of having to mail off the mistakes to get the correct versions from Capitol, I would have bought the set from Target weeks ago for less money. I'm very disappointed. This is not my typical experience with Amazon, but we are talking about the Beatles here...my favorite group of all...I don't want mistakes. I'll stick to ordering books from Amazon from now on."
3,"BEWARE, NO MORE REPLACEMENT DISCS FROM EMI","The music on the box itself is great. Plenty of other reviews go into detail about that. Packaging is okay, but again the big benefit is having the original US mixes and album lineups. That's where my problem comes in.I ordered this new from Amazon in late Feb 2011. I assumed that by now any of the versions with the incorrect Mono mixes on two of the discs would have been corrected and that I would receive a correct 4 disc set. Bad assumption. I received the wrong mono mixes of Rubber Soul and Beatles VI.So, I wrote to EMI Customer Service to make sure they'd still replace my discs.The reply...Sorry to inform you that this replacement project has been cancelled. Thisproject has been in place since 2006 and we have since run out of replacementdiscs.Thank you,EMI Music Quality AssuranceBOTTOM LINE: Don't order this unless you're okay keeping the incorrect mono mixes on the two error discs."
2,Needless and overpriced,"I bought it because I'm a completist. But I have to be honest, I didn't want it. I want remastered versions (mono and stereo) of the UK releases. When, oh, when, almight Apple?? Hopefully sooner than later, but until then I have this (and volume 1) for historical purposes only."
1,"SHAME ON ""CRAPITOL"", SHAME ON AMAZON!","On May 13, noticing the nice little disclaimer Amazon had listed then about how they now were only shipping a ""correct"" version of this CD with the authentic mono mixes for ""Beatles' VI"" and ""Rubber Soul"", I placed my order. What did I receive 1 week later? The BOGUS ""mistake"" version, with the fake mono, ""folded down stereo"" mixes! GRRRR!!! You blew it BIG TIME, Amazon! And as far as this ""mistake"" by ""CRAPITOL"" Records is concerned, I don't believe this was a mistake at all! Think about it, people: what in the world would ANYBODY today use folded-down stereo for, except to avoid searching for the authentic mono masters and taking the time to actually remaster them too? This neglect of duty is inexcusable, especially coming from CRAPITOL, who has made hundreds of millions off Beatles sales and stands to make even more millions off this reissue! RIP OFF!!! RIP OFF!!!"
3,4 months to get replacement,"Hey be careful buying this,,Took me only 4 months to get correct Rubber soul, and Beatle vI replacement discs..and last I checked in May 2007 Emi 1-800 phone number for replacement discs has been disconnected..read early reviews of this title to understand that you are looking for sk1 on yellow sticker ..3 stars for slow EMI handling of this"
5,Get This Box for Help,"Not for the soundtrack instrumentals, though they are somewhat entertaining. But the main Help tracks, common to this and the 2009 Help remaster, are superior in the Capitol version. Better stereo mix and brighter sound.Help, the song, has the James Bond intro. From the movie. Runs 2:39 instead of 2:19.The other three discs are reviewed here well enough."
4,Volume II Rocks,"This is a great box set. It brings me back to when I first heard my sister's version of Beatles IV. I've heard some complaints about the sound quality. Don't forget that when Capitol records got the masters from E.M.I., they changed the mix, by adding a little echo to the record. This was a common practice for records released at that time. Listen to any E.M.I. British Beatles release and you will notice the difference.For any Beatles fan growing up in the states, it is a must have. Along with volumeI ,it is something that will be enjoyed all the time. whole"
3,They Left Out Several LPs,"This set includes the American Capitol LPs of Help.Early Beatles,Beatles #8 and Rubber Soul,but what happened to The Beatles Story,and American Version of Hard Days Night?The VJ version of Introducing The Beatles is not included.The MGM album The Beatles with Tony Sheridan(Without Ringo, taped in the early 1960s.Tony Sheridan was a Gene Vincent Type rocker.)The MGM album wasnt a bad album.The Beatles did one of their few instumentals Ventures style,Cry For A Shadow.Sadly,its not here.Maybe someday the album will see the light of day on CD.Also not included is Beatles At Shea 1964.Some test pressings were put out,but pulled back.The 1970s Beatles at Shea 1964/65 was a letdown.Half of each Concert?That was plain stupid.Who wants half?Go Figure.However,The Capitol Albums #2 wasnt a bad set."
4,The same thing happened to me...,"My fiancee' ordered this set about a week ago for my birthday, and I received them today. The set did not have the SK-1 sticker, and it did not have the correct mono mixes of Beatles VI and Rubber Soul, despite Amazon's claim that they were only selling the corrected version. We ordered the longbox - I have no idea if the brick has the same problem.What's ironic is that I wanted these for the stereo mixes, but as a collector I also want the right mono mixes, so it's off to Capitol they go."
5,Capitol creates another collector's item...WHY???,"I got a copy of the error run. I couldn't care less about the collector situation except that, importantly to me, I haven't heard the original Stereo and Mono copies of Rubber Soul in 25 years. Sure would be nice to hear them after shelling out $60. Amazon...Capitol... are you there to correct this???"
3,Good spring but . . .,I like the idea of the spring end and how it can be protective of the motor. I really don't like the hitch mechanism where it attaches to the trailer. Having to always reach under a dripping boat to attach the transom saver is not the best design.
2,Too much drama not enough action,"An okay entry into the series but, way too much drama. She spent too much time worrying over the lead characters past and not enough time developing the romance or the mystery. It was very disappointing."
5,paranormal romance,If you want a great read you really need to read this series.Ms Feehan is a wonderful writter and has an imagination the surpasses so many authors. I love to read to escape the real world and so I only real fantasy type books so I can go out of myself and go somewhere far away.And all her books do that for me.The love scenes are wonderful and I feel like I am the lucky woman the hero loves.
2,Dark Destiny,"This book bored me to tears. The heroine was tiresome. The hero and his brother were interesting, but not enough to save the book. I've read everything Ms. Feehan has done. I'm currently reading Mind Games. I think I'll just stick to the new series and bid a fond farewell to the Dark series."
1,Big Disapointment,"Dark Destiny was a huge disappointment. I have read all of the Dark series and I can't put them down. This one took me days to get through,I had a hard time picking it up. It was truly one of the worst books I have ever read. I am not sure if I am looking forward to reading the next book in the series. I hope Ms. Feehan does a better job next time,if not she just might as well give it up."
5,Great Book,I love this book and all the books in this group that I have read.You are right there in the book.I hate haveing to put them down.
4,"Not the best dark novel, but still a great read",I'm one of those who have to have all books in a series - so it is great that there hasn't yet been a bad book in this one.
4,Nicolae & Destiny,"Another Great installment in the Dark Series. But I Really Didn't Care for the Narrator ""Richard Ferrone"" I don't know who decides who Narrates the Publisher or the author?? But....When an Author writes a Series there Should ""Only be one Narrator for the WHOLE Series"" or it Screws it ALL up Such As J.D. Robb her ""IN Death Series"" has ONE Narrator (Susan Ericksen), Sherryl Woods ""Chesapeake Shores Series"" One Narrator (Christina Traister) J.R.Ward ""Black Dagger Brotherhood Series"" (Jim Franqione) one Narrator!!!It's Very Annoying in a book Series when there is More than ONE NARRATOR for the Whole Series!!! I'm Sure that I'm Not the Only one that Feels that Way!!"
3,Fine but far from a favorite,"This one will not go down as a favorite in this series for sure. Didn't care for the heroine. Destiny was abducted and horribly tortured as a child. She lives seeing herself as a horrible monster because of what she turned into. Her only salvation was the voice of Nicolae that encouraged, comforted and kept her sane. When Nicholae finally finds her, however, she treats him atrociously! While one understands her fears, as the book progresses, her actions read more like a spoiled child's tantrums than a mature woman's insecurities.Nicholae is a stand out among the Carpathians of other books. He actually chooses to give her the choice in all things. He never forces his will on her, even to his detriment (unlike the other heros here-to-fore.) He has the patience of Job with a woman who, even the reader wants to shake at times.The storyline is average, not particularly exciting and a little confusing but a good who's-doing-it type. Three stars pretty much explains it all."
3,Difficult topic for a romance novel,"The Carpathian vampire novels are fantasy romance. They are intended for suspension of reality and to take people away from their lives. Sort of a timeout in order to refresh the soul. When you introduce a horrible subject like monstrous child abuse, it takes away from the escape from reality. That is not what these kinds of books are for and may be the reason why people are having such a difficult time with the book. The plot and the type of book are in conflict.I want escape when I read Carpathian novels. This wasn't it. On the other hand, Destiny was actually better adjusted and was able to form a positive relationship much more easily than most untreated women. I just did not care for this much reality."
4,Feehan Gets Another One Right,"This book was surprisingly well written, and I enjoyed reading it. I though the chemistry between Nicolae and Destiny was very realistic, and somewhat sizzling.Overall, very good read and one of the better Carpathian novels."
2,Lile 5-minute Coffee,"OK, I am anavid Feehan fan and will read and buy anything she publishes. But be warned that Dark Destiny is not what the first ""preview"" chapter makes it out to be.First, the book deals with issues that are more disturbing than informative. From child rape...to more sexual intense moments this book was gory to take for something that could entertain you.Secondly, after the 5th chapter the book goes into a depressing and repetitive tone that is just boring...the love tangle between the two characters does not seem authentic, more like forced by the author.I was really disappointed by the book, and will be more careful when choosing books in the future before reading reviews like this.People easily jump into conclusions that this is the greatest read in the world...but to be honest I put the book down too many times to allow that statement.I recommend that you BORROW or get the book from the library and preread some chapters to see where you stand...good luck."
4,Enjoyed It,I was kinda of surprised when I read some of the reviews. I really did like this book. I'm glad that I didn't read the reviews before buying the book. I'm not going to write a plot summary since other reviewers and Amazon have did that way better than I ever could. I enjoyed the interaction between the lead characters. I felt their strong bond. Destiny's whining didn't get on my nerves because people that have suffered that much abuse aren't whining as much as explaining how they feel the same way over and over again...pain. I really enjoyed the secondary characters and how much Ms. Feehan let the reader get to know them and feel for them. I would highly recommend this book to any new readers to Ms. Feehan and definitely to fans of her work. I feel this story furthered the development of what is going on with the Carpathian race and how they have a new poison to deal with.
2,Sighsss this just doesn't compare to her previous books,"I don't know what happen. But it seems that her creativity is spent towards Mind Game. The Dark Destiny lacks the spark that is found in her previous Cara. books. Those special intimacies between the main characters making fun of the ingrained arrogant... he-man.... know it all male characteristics is not as funny or enjoyable as it use to be. The concept of having a female hunter versus a male hunter is a great idea but not plotted well in this particular book.Ironic her other book recently released ""Mind Game' is by far a better book to read.Not worth the purchase. Perhaps used... maybe ....... or just borrow from a library before buying it if you really want buy it for your collection."
5,Destiny's Dilemma,"With Dark Destiny Ms Feehan has bought a new twist to the Carpathian series - a female Carpathian hunter.Destiny has spent her life destroying vampires, after one destroyed her childhood and made her life one of pain and solitude. To her if they suck blood they're a vampire.Nicolae was the only light during those long years. He taught Destiny everything she knew. Now the question is will Destiny use those lessons to destroy him.Dark Destiny is a very emotional book. There is deep sorrow - but also great humor when the two Carpathians are forcibly adopted by a Seattle neighbourhood. It answers some questions, for example what happens when lifemates meet too late. At the same time more questions are raised and the tempo is building.Ms Feehan consistantly provides strong stories with memorable characters. This is one of the best of the series and I highly recommend it."
1,Terrible,"Though I have loved the other books in the Dark Series, this one is terrible. Destiny is very whiny and seems to enjoy her victim status. Nicholae is a good character but the relationship with Destiny has no sizzle. It was mostly blood and gore with very little romance. Even though I have been a strong Feehan fan, I can NOT recommend this book."
4,She's back!,"This is the best book of the Dark series that she has written in quite a while. The past few have been very poor, but with this one Ms. Feehan proves herself to be back in fine form. This book has an actual plot and does not have the constant repetition that some of the others did. A few minor editorial errors - The heroine claiming to love to lay under the covers in the rain, when she sleeps under ground in the dirt - for one. Good job Ms. Feehan. Keep it up!"
3,Dark Destiny - slow,"I have read all of Christine Feehan's Dark series and so far I think this is the most boring. I felt it was slow moving and repetitive. Overall story is good, but the same one we have already read about 7 times. Give us something new please!!"
3,I just dont know..,I have always loved Christine Feehan's books. From my very first-Dark Prince- to all the other branch of stories she had written. But I find myself yawning throughout this book. It seems that she has fallen to a predictable writing style.Same old thing. Although I had high hopes for this one because it IS the first female hunter..but *sighs* there was just too much similarities..
5,DArk Destiny,"Dark DestinyI love the Carpathian series, though sometime the sex scenes are just too long in all her books"
5,Love this Book,This is my favorite author. Her book take you to a different world and a good get away from this one.
1,Not at all like pictured!,"VERY disappointed in how these look. The ""buckle"" is painted on the vinyl, so there is no strap, or appearance of a strap running through the buckle. No 3-d effect. It really looks pretty ridiculous and not at all like the front of a shoe. The shoe toes do not turn up as pictured. Just flat. Didn't really expect a lot from a shoe cover, but this is not worth wasting any money on."
1,NOT AS PICTURED OR DESCRIBED!,"WRONG PHOTO, WRONG DESCRIPTION! DO NOT BUY THESE unless you want shoe covers with a painted on buckle that really look pretty awful. They do NOT have a buckle of any kind; it is just painted onto the black part and looks pretty dumb. Not worth more than about $2."
1,So cheap!,I realize these were very inexpensive but they do not look like anything shown in the picture. The toes do not curl up and the buckle is not a separate piece. These are so cheap and definitely will be tossed in the garbage.
1,DO NOT PURCHASE THESE!,"These are not as they are pictured. They are just printed plastic with elastic bands. The tops do have some wire that makes them stand up. BUT THE TOES DO NOT CURL UP AND THE BUCKLE IS JUST PRINTED ON. There is no band through the buckle as shown and no substance at all to curl the toes. Once again, DO NOT PURCHASE THESE!"
5,Alive and Well,"This is their finest moment. No holds barred rock and roll stripped down to the barest essentials. Many bands can play fast and loud, but the Ramones remember the FUN."
2,NYC 1978 sounds better,"Although the track list is nearly identical to the NYC 1978 CD by King Biscuit, I had to crank up the bass ALL THE WAY to get an adequate sound out of this CD. It is easier to hear Joey's vocals and lyrics on this one, but overall, better sound and energy from NYC 1978. Ramones RAW is a, ""must have,"" BTW. : )"
3,LOTS OF CRAPPY FOOTAGE AND SOUND,"THE TITLE HERE SAYS IT ALL. I HAD TO SIT THROUGH LOTS OF GRAINY, FUZZY FOOTAGE AND WORSE - SONGS WHERE I COULDN'T EVEN HEAR JOEY'S VOCALS. YES THERE IS SOME DECENT FOOTAGE BUT OVERALL A LOT OF THE SAME STUFF/POOR QUALITY."
5,The Ramones at their peak,"""It's Alive"" is the Ramones, one of the greatest live bands ever, performing at the peak of their powers, and it is simply awesome.A lot of great live bands somehow never managed to capture the magic on vinyl or cd. Thankfully that is not the case with the Ramones."
5,The best place to start with for Ramones fans,"Just getting into the Ramones? Instead of picking up a greatest hits comp (after which you will have no need once you buy the actual studio albums), and pick up the live recording, sort of a ""Greatest Hits of the Early Years Live"" disc. After ""Kick Out the Jams"" and ""Live at Fulsom"", this is the best live recording I have heard. A must buy for Ramones fans and for fans of rock 'n' roll in general, this being the second best album of the bruthas after ""Rocket to Russia"". The best live albums are the ones that make you feel the energy of the show, the ones that make you wish you had been there. This manages to fall into both categories."
5,Has always been their best album,"This has always been the best Ramones album. The Ramones were always a great live band, but could also take advantage of a studio. This, however, outshines any studio effort they ever made (although Animal Boy is a very close second). The pace is frantic, and the songs are, well, the songs. The sound is far better than most live albums of this era. Go for it! What do you have to lose?"
1,Ramones It's Alive?,"Wikipedia claims the guitar, voice and bass were actually recorded in the studio, citing an interview with Marky Ramone. If this is true(and there is a conformation from Wiki comparing the DVD to the CD),then it is probably unfair to compare this to other ""live"" albums. This is disappointing as I have just purchased this bogus album. The truth is an elusive and practically unattainable commodity in the world. But I guess I should have known that."
4,The Lovers Path Tarot,"This is a beautiful tarot deck with lovely artwork and interesting choice of ""lovers"", mostly from classical sources. The Hermit card, for instance, chooses Abelard and Eloise and shows Abelard in his monk's robe in his cell, creating an illuminated page with a picture of Eloise. Other lovers are from Greek mythology or fairy tales, etc. But why oh why did they change the name of the Major Trumps? Death becomes Transformation, for instance, and The Hanged Man becomes Sacrifice. It is all very New Agey and PC, and I find it annoying. Some people may like it. Also, the presentation, boxing, instruction book, etc. is over-the-top, elaborate and fussy. Again, this may be appealing to some."
3,A troubled season,"Angel is by far one of the best television shows ever written. The witty dialogue, the double entendres, the intertwined plot lines - all outstanding. So what went wrong in Season 4? Rather than concentrating on ""helping the helpless"" the crew was caught up in an ugly family affair gone horribly wrong. This storyline dragged on far too long and was very loosely tied up all in the last two episodes of the season. In particular, the demise of Jasmine can only be described as idiotic.Get Season 4 anyway, if only to carry you into Season 5 (or if you really like Wesley - the steamy sex scenes with him and Lilah definitely show a different side of ""English."") At least in Season 5, Connor's gone and Spike is back."
1,Save your money,"Don't bother spending $40 to buy this season on DVD. Get cable TV, wait for the Season 4 episodes to re-air. Then, tape the following episodes: ""Deep Down"" and ""Awakening."" If you do that, you'll have the only episodes in the entire season worth watching more than once. Believe me, if you skip the majority of the season, you'll be better off emotionally and pyschologically. I wish I'd never seen a single episode of ""Angel"" past the Season 3 finale ""Tomorrow.""I won't be wasting my money on this DVD set. You shouldn't either. Try Angel seasons 1-3 instead."
1,unplayable dvds dont rock,"although i have buffy 1-6, and angel 1-3 (as well as many other movie dvds) this edition was put out by a different company, as determined by different packaging. it will not play on my (cheap) standard american dvd player giving an 'out of area' error. i suspect buying an expensive dvd player might work, but since it is supposed to be an american dvd to be played on a standard american dvd player, which i have, im not about to go shopping right now. the dvds i have are completely useless to me."
5,"Denisof, Romanov steal the show","Picking up where its amazing 3rd Season left off, Season 4 of TV's Angel was without a doubt the most shocking, dramatic and intriguing. Despite a few creative low points, the cast and crew rose to the challenge of Angel's new full fledged story-arch format, with all 22 episodes weaving together to create one feature-length episode.The season deals with issues such as fascism, religious persecution and world peace brilliantly, staying subtle, yet getting the message across perfectly. However, the season's real highlight is the shocking relationship between Wesley (Alexis Denisof) and Lilah (Stephanie Romanov), creating one of the series' most eerie, dysfunctional and altogether fascinating relationships."
5,Best Angel Yet,"Season 3 took the characters to a pretty dark place, and left them there. It also lacked crossover visits from Buffy characters we have come to know and love. Season 4 emerges brilliantly from that place! Each episode was at least very good and most were great. I particularly liked the crossover episodes featuring Willow and Faith!Season 4 had some wonderful suprising plot twists. I think that a theme was the reversal of character orientation (in terms of goodness and evil :). Angel turning bad. Wesley becomes good again. Gunn becomes a murderer. Fred briefly might be bad (in Shiny Happy People) And Cordy bad as the beastmaster! And the big-bad, Jasmine, good or bad?I really like the whole Jasmine twist! I thought it was much better than the Pylea thing at the end of season 2.Also the fight scenes in season 4 are excellent! In my opinion season 4 is the best so far, and I really look forwards to season 5 on DVD."
4,The weakest season of Angel but still great,"Angel season 4 is easily the weakest season of Angel throughout it's 5 year run.The show dropped all pretense of having stand alone plots and became one long 22 episode arc, although to the hardcore fan this should be wonderful news, it doesn't exactly work.The problem is the plot isn't all that strong, it starts great, and than becomes more and more disorganised, Conner, Lorne and Cordelia are all given less than stellar material to work with, and the plot sags a bit near the end.That doesn't mean this season is in anyways bad, a bad angel season is still much stronger than the vast majority of television shows. It is still better than the weakest Buffy seasons (season 4 and 7 in my opinion) and it is still very entertaining even at it's weakest point.If you bought the first 3 seasons this is a must-have, and leads into the phenomenal but different final season."
2,The worst of Angel,I was so disappointed with the direction this season took from making Cordy evil to having her sleep with Connor (ewwww) to the whole evil Jasmine storyline..there are a few good episodes but this season almost made me stop watching this show...and the fact that this was to be Charisma Carpenters last season even though she and the fans wanted her to come back made it all the more harder to swallow...I am surprised to hear that Joss thought this was the best season as it truely is the worst
3,Not the best story line or season,"Not my favorite year of Angel, but I needed it to make my collection complete and it did have some good episodes especially at the end. I think I just didnt like seeing Cordelia evil and then the whole coma thing, not to mention her shackin up with connor not my favorite story line by any means."
2,Worst season so far,"As a huge fan of Angel and Buffy I have to say I was surprised to dislike Angel Season 4. The cliffhanger of Season 3 had me chomping at the bit to buy this box set and find out what happens to these great characters. Then by the last disc I didn't even really care what was going to happen. Jasmine absolutely sucks as a villain and Cordelia's character went very much downhill. This is the writer's fault by the way not Charisma's. In the beginning of the season I had high hopes as The Beast was pretty interesting, but then it all just got corny. The soap opera part of the series which is necessary to really flush out the characters was just too ""soapy"". The episodes with Faith almost brought me back, but overall the story was just too terrible. I'm hoping season five brings me back or I won't even care about the cancelation."
1,Angel's 4th****Hey that should be 5 stars,"A mixed bag, this season was. I have to agree with most, that the fourth year was certainly one of the most chaotic and they missed many chances to make season four as good as 2 and 3. The biggest flaw was Vincent Kartheiser, who while a fine actor, made Connor so annoying and so bland one could careless if he survived or not. Then came that awkward sex scene in"
5,Angel,Really liked how Cordelia changed from her high school days. I kept watching each episode not wanting them to end.
4,Hmmm,"This season has good & bad. It's Angel, so it's good, but it's the worst of Angel. It has somedisapointng plots, and not enough thought into where the Connor character should go.In some ways this season, was like season 3 part 2, cause both season are one big story.The good in this season is that there are some great fight scenes, some return of a few beloved characters from Buffy. And the biggest & baddest villian to ever to appear in the Whedonverse.As for the DVD, the features are great. Lot's of good interviews & featurettes. Plus a helluva lot of commentaries. I was, however, dispointed that they didn't put any delted scene like the last season. So I can't rate it a perfect score."
5,Amazing Season,"Season 4 is my favorite season of Angel, beating out all seasons of Buffy as well. I'm puzzled as to why it got such low ratings. OK, so Connor is annoying. However, I don't think that he ruins the season at all. He complicates things, but the complications of this season are what are so great to watch. In fact, I loved the episode ""Inside Out"" which was largely Connor based. I find the character obnoxious, but he makes things interesting. Plus, this season has the privelage of having Steven S Deknight as a writer and director! I highly recommend this season."
1,Just Awful,"This was the worst season of Angel and wrecked the series for me. Why did Cordelia have to go evil? They also made Fred go strange in Season five. I think this is misogyny on the part of the creators. There's lots of misogyny in the Sci-fi/fantasy universe and this is more of the same. Notice that the dumb blonde Harmony is the only female character to come out unscathed? This show doesn't work without Cordelia, and having her become posessed and sleep with Angel's son (gross) to cover for the actrice getting pregnant was just an awful idea."
3,STOP THE 1000 WORD REVIEWS,"People, make your review short and to the point.ANGEL SEASON 4...1. Connor sucks2. Story line is decent but no great3. Nice to see Cordy mack it up with someone (she's hot) but too bad its Connor.4. Episodes with Connor/COrdy child so,so5. BUT, I will still buy it"
5,--Best Season Yet--,"Joss Whedon has done the impossible yet again by giving Buffyverse fans around the world another delightful season of Angel. Season Four does not have any shortcomings; it kept my complete attention throughout with its complex plot full of Whedon's usual twists and surprises. Cordelia's character undergoes quite the transformation, leaving audiences shocked, stunned, and satisfied. Having a continuous storyline arc involving Conner, Darla, Cordelia, Jasmine, and the Beast, Angel Season Four couldn't possibly leave any true Buffy fan disappointed."
4,tragically beautiful and funny,"While season two will always be my favorite, this season had some tragibeautiful moments. Among them : Wesley's decision about Angelus; Cordelia's admission of love; the return of Faith; and Connor's desperate need for family in whatever form. Also of note is a very good episode directed by hobbit extraordinairre Sean Astin.The DVDs are well put together, with good interviews and a very funny commentary on the memory-loss episode. I don't understand why only Cordelia and Angel can be on the cover of EVERY season, though.There is some very disappointing stuff, too, most upsetting is the loss of Cordelia. She doesn't die this season, but she might as well have, which makes me want to scream, ""Joss! Why did you spend 3 years trying so hard for me to like this character, only to write her off when she becomes the heart of the show?"" For this, I dock it one star."
2,Typical Joss - he ruins a once great show,"Although a once hard-core BtVS / AtS fan, I gave up on Buffy in Season 6 and Angel in Season 4. Typical Joss Whedon - he makes great characters and then can't resist ruining them by introducing more and more plot contrivances and less and less subtlety, in what I assume is an ongoing effort to one-up himself.This season of Angel, though well-written and well-acted, takes the downward turn in plot that started in Season 3 (Connor, the Cordy ascension, the icky and ham-fisted Cordy/Angel 'romance'), and plunges even further into utter crap. The entire Cordy storyline is out of left field and a real character assassination, and the 'Big Bad' of the season is ridiculous and more annoying even than Holtz.Honestly, I guess this season is worth a watch if you're a fan of the show, but it certainly isn't worth buying."
5,Dark and intriguing,"Angel can go to the dark side at times. But if you like fantasy shows with action, intriguing scripts, superb acting, and surprising twists this is the show.I was disappointed when Angel left BTVS. But after seeing what the new show became, I'm glad. In my opinion, this has to rate as one of the best spinoffs ever."
4,The Beast Is The Star,Great Season. Not a starting on point though in my opinion. If you like Angel this is an amazing season though.
1,The Character of Cordy was Ruined!,Angel is an awesome show but season 4 is the worst season.I have no problem with the Jasmine story arc but the evil Cordy story arch was dragged out way longer than it needed to be and Charisma Carpenter who I normally like was just off this season. She seemed bored and like she would rather have been doing something else and like she had no energy. I don't know maybe it was because of her behind the camera battles with the WB executives or maybe it's the fault of the writers that Cordy was so boring this season!
3,One big story arc....,"This season was what got Angel cancelled. A person had to watch every single episode or they were completely lost. This didn't help attract new fans. Small, 4 or 5 episode story arcs can breath new life into a show, but this was a seasonal arc! The acting is still believablech, and new dimensions of old characters were explored. Definitely not receommended for newcomers--start at the beginning.If you're craving more vampires since Angel was cancelled--try FOREVER KNIGHT, starring a vampire cop searching for redemption--yes, they did it first!"
1,Crap,"Crappy Crappy McCrap Crap, just about describes this season.Angel season 1 and 2 were great, nearly matching the standard set by Buffy, beginning of season 3 was ok, but then we met HIM, the child of satan, son of beelzebub(otherwise known as Connor.) Connor ruined Angel, his weedy looks, annoying lines, bad dialogue-everything about him was crap, and putting him in the centre of a storyline that made you hate him even more made this series terrible. The whole Connor/Cordy thing was the worst thing ever done by Whedon, and the end of the series really made you wonder whether Angel had had it or not. Luckily season 5 saw Spike enter the balance which kept viewers interested, but season 5 still seemed to lack the fun of 1 and 2. Season 4 ruined Angel. Period."
2,Cheap and unnecessary,"I remember the ""Martian Chronicles"" with Rock Hudson, Maria Schell and others and I'm still waiting for a re-release of this mini-series. I bought ""The Martian episodes"" instead and it's nothing but a cheap and unnecessary remake. Sci-Fi Fans will maybe enjoy it, but there is certainly better stuff on the market !"
3,This TV movie is a very good presentatio of Bradbury's book.,"I remember seeing the Martian chronicles when first it aired on Television as a mini-series. I never thought that any one could accurately put Bradbury's poetic vision of Martian colonization and the end of the earth on celuloid. This film does an admirable job of presenting Bradbury's vision. Although there are a few scenes that some might consider to be slightly campy, overall, the film is haunting and poetic. The mini-series does what no single movie could have. For any Bradbury fan, it is a welcome gift to see his words translated to screen, as they have rarely been done in the past."
2,Low budget film but worth watching,An extremely low budget and cheap film. It is divided into 5 mini stories based on Bradburys Martian Chronicles. It is no where near as good as the original Chronicles starring Rock Hudson.
3,The set-up was pretty obvious....,"I didn't read the first book in this series, so I can't make comparisons, but I did like the story.Six hundred thousand humans are slaughtered on Treetrunk, a remote planet. Their destruction is mythodical and complete. However, one man survives by taking a worn out shuttle and leaving the planet before the death squad reaches him.Once found, the survivor recovers and recounts the horrific events, but no one believes him when he reveals who was responsible for the planet's genocide.I decided who the 'bad guys' were early on. Figuring that out so early usually ruins a book for me, but I kept reading because I wanted to see how it all turned out.Foster cleaned up all the story lines and created a new one right at the end -- perfect planning for a sequel.Enjoy!"
3,Dirge - a song of grief,"Phylogenesis; Alan Dean Foster was the first in the series just published in paperback last year. That book was the hook and this expensive hardback is pure publisher greed. Foster is a great storyteller and this series is a good sci-fi humanx interest tale. I would wait for the paperback, however, and save your praise for the paperback version to reward this great author and deny his greedy publisher."
3,Nothing New - But Fun To Read,"For those who have been pay attention the Commonwealth books for years, we all knew who the bad guys were here, who the good guys were, and how it ends. Unlike Phylogenisis, the major plot points here had all been referenced to in the orginial books (though as historical asides). Nevertheless, filling in the details was fun. And how many of you noticed that Mallory and Tse combine to form Tse-Mallory. Where's Bran to tell the story when you need him? A good read, and an important book in the Commonwealth history -- but not as much new and surprising information as Foster usually provides."
3,Background info...is a good thing!,"when i read this book i already knew who the bad guys were, having read the entire Flinx&Pip series repeatedly, but that did not alter the fact that this was a very enjoyable, if predictable, read. It is certainly not the best of the commonwealth history books, i would proffer ""Nor Crystal Tears"" as the best pre-history, but it does fill in blanks in the commonwealth storyline. Dirge also sees the forming of the future major religion of the commonwealth. The story is an interesting mix of horror and triumph. overall a good read"
4,"Not Foster's best, but very enjoyable!",This book did not have all the action or grandness of a usual Foster book. It was still a good read though and I think he is setting up some really good stuff for the sequel.If you are an avid Humanx commonwealth reader though (as I am) this is a 'must read'-Dashro
3,Not Comfortable,"I love the way these shoes look and the price was good. Unfortunately, they are uncomfortable."
1,dont waste your money,"this show would be perfect, except the strap is attached differently on each shoe. they are obviously defective."
5,I love these targets,"If you have trouble seeing if you are even hitting the target, and are learning to shoot, these will give you instant feedback. Now they are a bit more expensive, so just keep that in mind when blowing through them"
5,really nice,These are excellent for pistol practice. No scope needed. For rifle at 100 yds binoculars are needed. I wish they included a few more dots to cover the holes.
5,Easy on the Eyes,These targets are great when I am target shooting it makes it really easy to see where you are striking the target. Glad I learned about these kind of target
5,See where you hit,"I love the Shoot-N-C targets. They make it so much easier to see where you hit the target, especially at longer distances. The self adhesive back sure beats having to bring a roll of tape or staple gun too the range."
5,"Best targets of their kind. Highly visible, patches, self adhesive.","Much more affordable to buy the bulk packs online than the small packs at stores. These show markings better than any other targets I've used, but they are also more expensive."
2,"good video, bad designed product","A guy in our band bought the 2480 to record our cd, Noiseful Joy. The manual is thicker than a family Bible and takes just about as long to read and understand. This recorder was obviously created by some really brilliant people from Roland, but I don't think the common man was considered as the end user. As a result, even with this dvd, trying to explain such a complicated machine, you still need more smarts than more than one of us who viewed the dvd and manual many times.In all fairness, we use the digital mixer section of the 2480 as a rehearsal board now and that portion is fairly straight forward."
2,way too short,"This story is way too short and not interesting enough to justify buying and shipping costs. If you can borrow it from a friend or library, it's a reasonably good way to kill an hour or so."
5,Cannot be beaten for the price.,"Exactly what I expected...A printed flag. It is hemmed all around and the printing is bright and clear. The hoist is solid with grommets. It is printed through, so the charge is mirrored on the reverse, but my intent was to hang it on the wall anyway. It certainly could be flown outside, but have know idea how it would last under inclimate conditions."
4,Still Feelin' You,"I have been a Dave Hollister fan since his days with BlackStreet. I highly anticipated the release of ""Ghetto Hymns"" while he endured pushed back release dates, and record label drama. I was not disappointed by his debut nor with his latest. This release is a wonderful sophmoric effort. He is still building from ""Ghetto Hymns"". This brotha, as always, sings from the depths of his soul and unleashes feeling and emotion like no other R&B singer out there today. With all the trash and studio-engineered artistry on the radio and in record stores today, I appreciate Dave Hollister more than words can say. Dave Hollister joins Donny Hathaway on my list of singers that make a person feel ""it"" in their gut. That list is now at two. Keep doin' it Dave...I feel you.Standout tracks: ""Doin' Wrong"", ""On The Side"", ""Destiny"", ""I Don't Want To Be A Hustler,"" ""One Woman Man""."
5,This one is better than the first,"This CD is off the HOOOOOOOOOOOOOK!!!! I didn't like it at first, but everytime i listened to it, it got better and better. Now i listen to it everyday. If you like this one, go and get Syleena Johnson, she is that real. If you aren't into deep, real music then don't get it. It's for mature listeners. Dave's CD is bangin'. It's a must have."
4,One Woman Man,"Mr Hollister you've done it again. I wouldn't say this ablum is better than his 1st. But it's still HEAVY!!! I love the tune ONE WOMAN MAN!!! I think that the best best song ont he ablum. And to all you cheater out there, y'all need to get this ablum and become a ONE WOMAN MAN!!!!!"
4,From Blackstreet To Easy Street,"Dvae you got me sold on the One Woman Man! That song and the video was enough for me to take a gamble. I didnt hear Ghetto Hymns but I heard it was the bomb. Hey the phrase will always be This reminds me of all the nights I used to beat it up Iwould do it again but I cant. Hey that says it all, looking forward to the next cd from Dave."
5,Awesome...,"If you don't have this in your collection, you DON'T have a collection. Chicago style R&B at its finest. Bought this CD when it was first released, still listen to it today (heavy rotation)!"
5,daver dave dave,"This cd takes me back, I love Dave Hollister, R&B just aint the same. This was when we still had something to sing about. I was very happy with how soon I got my cd and it was in really good condition."
3,Huh?,"I have an original copy of this book, which is of historical interest but seriously out of date in regard to actual fishing advice. My question is, Why in the devil does the cover have a picture of a field of wheat? Weird."
2,Be True To Yourself,"Christopher is teased because he is the smallest tree on Mr. Stump's lot. Still, he believes he is special and someone will see that ... even on Christmas Eve as Mr. Stump is closing the lot. And he's right. This is a story of having faith in one's self. The story has great potential as a reminder to kids to be themselves. The laminated pages make this a sturdy book. The story has a nice theme, but the illustrations don't always convey the action and are overdone. We were quite disappointed that the tape brought to life the teasing (which we were able to play down in the readings)."
4,Family Favorites-Sports,A bundle of 3 children's sports movies that we have enjoyed in the past. I was excited to see them bundled together and at a great price for the group.
3,Family favorites,I bought this trio because I read somewhere that one of the movies was filmed in my old home town. They were good family fun movies and that's about it. (I didn't really recognize my old home town...)
3,Best Intentions,"I can't say that I am a complete fan of his music. But I have to say out of all the tracks on the album ""Mary Go Round"" is the best. ""Mary go Round"" has a very straight forward melody and I love the play with words. I can play that song all day and never get tired of it. I hope to hear from him in the future with a more defined sound of his own."
1,Poor,There were no features of this product that stood out to me. The cd did not arrive in the time specified by the seller.My experience from this cd waas not good because the first three tracks were scratched which makes it not a listenable cd for the money I spent and I would not recommend this seller to others.
4,i like it alot,i have all of his cd's and i think this one is my favorite. i like every track on it.
2,This album is completly average,"This album is completely average. Musiq can't sing. He can't write good, thought provoking songs. And his choice of beats leaves me much to be desired. Forgive me if I've been spoiled by the likes of Maxwell, D'Angelo, Amel Larrieux, Eric Benet, and Jill Scott....but this kid can't hold a flame to anyone. Skip it and go buy some Automator material for your money."
3,...i'm feelin generous...,"...okay...i've delayed it long enough...maybe i'm jus' gettin old...maybe i'm already old...i dont know...but i've let this grow on me about all that it's gonna do and now: aijuswanamaekitstop!(i just want to make it stop!) a few years ago i'd pr'oly be all over this, hypin it, tellin folks about how good it was...IN HIS FAVOR, THE BROTHA GOT THE WOMEN ON LOCK! AND THE POTENTIAL IS DEFINITELY THERE...,but fa'now, i just want somebody to shoot the neo-soul category altogether. this was that straw!"
2,Another Factory Driven Product,yes he sounds just like a low-budget D'angelo&Maxwell.typical of the business to throw Clones out so fast.it use to be about at least trying to be half way Original but nowadays that has gone outof the window.Musiq is ok but nothing Ground-Breaking or different than what's out now.the cut Just Friends sounds like a Poor Man's take on D'angelo's LAdy.it's safe music but nothing that will last.there will be another Factory Product soon you haven't heard the last.it trips me out because D'angelo&Maxwell have only been out a few years?Clone City.
1,It's Really Bad,This cd is one of the worst contrived pieces of R&B. Def Jam wanted a wanted to be included in the soul music that's coming out now and put Musiq out for bait. All I can say is he better enjoy his 5 minutes while it last.
5,Musiqally talented,"This is one of the best CD's i've heard in a loooooooong time. I've only had it for 2 days and I swear I've listened to it six times. I really enjoy that this CD isn't all about sex and money it has a fresh perspective on a lot of subjects and a lot of soul. I love the song ""love"" (#7) its already on my voicemail. This CD is great its maybe one song that I really don't feel but Musiq is talented I really am feeling this CD."
5,This is definately what real MUSIQ should be about.....,"From the first time I heard ""Just Friends (Sunny)"" I anticipated Musiq's debut into the music world. I am very much impressed with and touched by his album. Not only does MUSIQ have something different to say than many of todays R&B artist, his style is very much different in a wonderful way. He also has and incredible voice that he effortless shows off on one of my favorite tracks on the album 7. Love. He has the most touching ballads and the most sincere ""game"" that I have ever heard from a male singer. Like another reviewer has already said, this album is one that can be enjoyed from beginning to end. I can go on and on describing this album but that would be too time consuming. The entire album is just perfect in an original way."
4,Musiq Lover,"The 1st of 3 very hot cds. When I first heard ""Sunny, Just friend"" I must have played it @least 4xs. I am so crazy about this man's style. This is cd is hot. Out of all the tracks I would say that I might skip over maybe 2. After listening to this cd....I am really a musiq lover."
5,Musiq,"I bought this cd yesterday at and I have to say that it might be the best RB cd that I have heard. It has the beats, the production, I am very, very impressed and highly recommend it. Even slightly better then Mama's Gun to me."
3,Some Real Good Cuts,"The CD has a nice sound to it, but lacks some originality. Much of the CD sound like D'Angelo (maybe that's why it's not such a bad CD). Nevertheless, I'm feeling Girl Next Door and 143, and I didn't waste my money."
4,Musiq Soulchild,"This album is tight!!! I got a copy off a female friend and I just popped the CD in, couldn't stop listening to it. Had to get a copy. Lyrics are tight, jazzy, soulfull, mellow. Definitely, philly inspired. No doubt, there are influences of D'Angelo and Stevie, but I believe Musiq has his own originality. Favorite track is 'Seventeen' (#10)!! Nomination for a Grammy please!!!!"
4,Pick it up...,"There are very few CDs these days that you can listen to from beginning to end. There are usually those choice couple of tunes that you start skipping once you've had the album a while.Thus far, after almost a month of having the debut album by Musiq Soulchild, I haven't yet found a tune that I don't like. If you like raw, undisguised emotion and lyrics to match, this is the album for you. Now, don't get me wrong... Although there have been numerous comparisons to D'Angelo and Maxwell(?), Musiq is not a premiere vocalist. He's solid, though, and his lyrics and head-nodding tracks paint a musical picture that's hard to resist. Some of my favorites are ""You and Me"", ""Love"" and ""You Be Alright"".So, pick this one up, and if he swings through your town, check out the brother in concert. If his album is any indication, it'll be a great show :)"
5,GET THIS NOW,"This album really is tight. WHen I heard ""Sunny, Just Friends"", on the radio I automatically assumed that Jon B. was back. But to my surprise there was someone else that help to make natural music one that's finally getting a chance to soar. Musiq is in now. With songs like ""Girl Next Door"", ""Love"", ""Mary Go Round"", Jon B. might have some competition."
1,disappointed,When I got the cd I noticed there where scratches and marks on the disk. I played it in my car and after the first couple of songs (which played fined) the disk began to skipped. This did that all the way through making it impossible to listen until finally I just ejected the cd. I'm very disappointed with the seller who would sell this product without even checking it out first to make sure that none of these issues would have came up.
2,weak lyrics,"Am I the only one who finds Musiq's name really stupid? What about the album title? Well I guess that was enough hints before I bought the CD. Musiq is not very good with words. Don't get me wrong, this brother has the voice, he definitely shines on ""Love"". But take his first single ""Just Friends"" for example, the lyrics are simply unbearably superficial. And that's what separates a true artist from the average singers. I mean, R. Kelly can talk about bump and grind as much as he wants, but he hasn't had a song like Marvin Gays's ""Sexual Healing"" or ""Let's Get It On"" yet. Musiq is no way near Jill Scott lyrically. In fact, he has a lot to learn from her. However, the production is pretty solid and consistent throughout the album. By the way, the CD booklet design is ruined by the last page where it says ""PHILADELPHIA P.A."" and has 4 pictures of Musiq. Looks like someone who has no sense of composition and typography had a little too much fun in Photoshop."
4,this is an enjoyable cd.,"Please reviewers, stop comparing Musiq to D'Angelo, because D'Angelo sucks. This cd was fun to listen to, while the D'Angelo's cd was agonizing. I think Musiq is talented and look forward to hearing more from him."
5,BUY THIS ALBUM NOW!,"This album has left me speechless, and that rarely happens! I had to write a review because everyone needs to know about Musiq Soulchild. The whole album is on constant repeat, but my favorite songs are Poparatzi, Love, Seventeen, and You and Me. But you won't have to worry about fast forwarding any song on this album. You'll most definetely get your monies worth! SO BUY IT NOW!"
5,Me thinks this Young Man be da Bomb,"This is a must have for anyone who wants to hear someone who can give physical presence to their own emotion. I am amazed at how his heart felt renderings can move me and make me want to ""get my groove on"", simultaneously. Also intersting is the way he sings about things that are relevant to him, or at least he makes you think so."
4,I LOVE THIS CD !,"I love this record! The soulfulness & expression all over this record proves to me that although the real artists are overlooked, that real soul in today's music isn't dead. Soulchild's music will definitely stand the test of time. I love the entire record, but my two favorite songs are ""SPEECHLESS"" & ""SETTLE FOR MY LOVE"". ""SETTLE FOR MY LOVE"" was written & recorded in 1979 by one of my favorite singers/musicians, PATRICE RUSHEN & Soulchild & A TOUCH OF JAZZ did a hell of a job on that track! Soulchild, keep the same formula you are using & you'll keep me as a true fan."
3,Cheap and BRIGHT,Falls apart easily and the light is almost too bright. I had to put it behind a door to block majority of the light.
1,Save your money,"If you like poor quality, poor taste and inconsistency in your drinks this is the brand for you. Alot of complaints when this mix is used"
1,Dont bother overpriced poor quality,"strong celery taste nasty smirnoff, dalys and especially major peters are much better. Guests complained about the taste of tbe drinks. Luckily had some major peters in stock and people were much happier"
3,Blah!,"Honestly, I expected something much more from such good writers. I was disappointed--so much so that I just couldn't finish it. Unfortunately, in many places, the three writing styles don't blend together leaving you wondering are they talking about the same characters here? Their mannerisms and exact ways of speaking change from author to author, which can be really frustrating. Also, the threat of the invasion of their precious city is the focus of the book--but you don't know their city, and don't give a darn what happens to it. You want to take over the city? Go ahead, for all I care! Also, I know that the authors tried to create very strong women, but I find that they are somehow...lacking. There are better characters out there--especially from Mercedes Lackey, Marion Zimmer Bradley and Andre Norton. BUT the characters in this book just are not up to their usual standards. It's too bad, really. If you are looking for a good book, then I suggest you keep looking"
2,crass,"One would have thought that three excellent writers combined are able to come up with something that is at least average! But this book is beyond that... Predictable plotlines, shallow characters and the standart ending are still the better part. Nevertheless that I can hardly stand the way how the characters are divided into two groups...good and evil...with the evil mage to pleat the case. But the book is not totally beyond help...I rather liked the idea of the story.. but the way it has worked out...if you love tastless, predictable romance... enjoy!"
2,There was just something missing...,"I just didn't GET this book...the three ladies who wrote it are, as far as I'm concerned, three of the most important female fantasy writers of all time. Yet I simply couldn't get into this book. The writing styles were just too different, and the story moved too slowly...this is a danger of multiple perspectives: the authors must backtrack to catch ""their"" character up to the others, and the reader is left slogging through a 400-page mess. I think that if this book had been a little better organized (and the characters a bit more believable) I would have enjoyed it more. As it was, it just left me with this vauge headache and the need to go back, re-read certain passages, and finall, put the book down and not come back to it."
3,An average fantasy story,"I liked this book, but I expected more from Mercedes Lackey and Marion Zimmer Bradley, probably because I loved Lackey's ""The Last Herald-Mage"" and Zimmer Bradley's ""Avalon"". I've never read anything by Andre Norton, so I wouldn't know about her writing style. Read this book, it's alright, but if you haven't read the author's individual works, read them first. My theory is that Lackey wrote most of Leopold's sections. He was the one character I liked. The women were somewhat boring. Lydana could just not keep my attention. Read it and tell me if you thought the same thing."
4,It's o. k.,"I was very disappointed by Black Trillium, so I wondered if I should try to read this at all, but I was surprised in a nice way. The story is't as intriguing as others by Marion Zimmer Bradley - and I think many people will judge this book mainly by this standard. It's written quite well, so it was fun reading, and that's already a lot.(and a whole lot more than Black Trillium"
1,This book commits the greatest crime of all: boredom.,"Two chapters in, nothing has happened yet. Six chapters in, still nothing. The characters go on and on and on about what they're going to do and what they're feeling and what they're wearing. If their feelings were more than one-dimensional, that at least would be interesting. Of all three of these women writers, not one can write a story about war. Or running a country. The way they set things up is beyond unrealistic. The reader will only suspend disbelief if they know as little about gov't as these authors do. Why does everyone do EVERYTHING in secret? They are RULERS. They have RESPONSIBILITIES. They act like immature children who can run around doing anything they want, just because they're women born of a special ""breed"". We need good, strong stories about complex female characters, including women rulers. This story is nothing but typical fantasy fare."
1,"great facts and insight, but no entertainment value","The video contains many great facts about the invention of the television, but the delivery of these facts are horrible. The description does not tell you that the video was created in 1996 and has the pacing of an old documentary. I'm sure a newer video about the television would be better, but this video is a sleeper. I could never use it in my classes at school."
2,Analytic Heidegger not Continental Heidegger,"The blurb by Pattison, himself a sensitive analytic reader of Heidegger, is misleading and cautious readers should be advised to take care. Rudd offers for his own part a ""sensitive"" analytic reading of Heidegger (and he managages to do so in the context of Wittgenstein's thought, a thinking long hijacked and somewhat deformed by insensitive analytic readings -- which may, perhaps, explain the plaintive wish Pattison expreses). But such approaches only attempt to undo the damage done by the analytic tradition and, sympathetic as this may be, it does not make them continental. This is by no means a warning against the book, which has to be judged on its own analytic terms, but it is a plea for fairness in making distinctions between the contested terms analytic and continental..."
3,Where's Shaun? Where's Neon?,"Im dissapointed in this one. I think the songs are kinda dull. The have concemtrated on becomming an awesome jamming live band, a true Jam Band. I think this one was rushed out because the fans were hungry for new material. I love Shaun and am dissapointed by the shortage of her wonderful powerful voice on this one.Anther note... In the liner notes of ""Aint Had Enough Fun"", Bill promises that a Neon Park painting would always grace the cover of Little Feat albums; this one doesnt have one, and I miss it."
4,"Feat move into a more confident, mature phase","I've followed the Feat for 30 years and seen them live over 20 times (Lowell and post-Lowell). There has never been any doubt about the musicianship of the band, but they have not consistently been good songwriters since reforming in the late 80s. Kickin It At The Barn marks a turn to a more confident, more mature (funny to say that word...these guys are no spring chickens) style. The songs on the album are strong yet subtle. Corazones Y Sombras is ambitious, but ultimately it was not what I wanted to hear. The only clunker is I Do What the Telephone Tells Me To Do. The playing is good..it's just not lyrically strong. Speaking of lyrics...or the absence of them -- I can't get enough of Stomp. It reminds me of Brothers And Sisters era Allman Bros...but it's definitely authentic Feat. Can't wait to hear it electric and live."
5,Christmas With A Light Touch,"Most holiday albums are really oversweetend by the presence of heavy orchestra, bells, chimes, vibes, choirs, etc. This album is a beautiful album of Christmas music featuring piano, guitar, sax, and one vocal performance by Michael Franks. ""Christmas Time Is Here"" featuring Michael on lead vocal, is changed from a piano solo piece to a lilting pop/jazz lounge song. It's pure escapist, and a delight. David's light touch on all the songs will have you playing this one over and over again."
3,Christmas CD,Not as good as I thought it would be and I love David Benoit. I have a lot of Christmas CD but did not have any David Benoit
4,Christmas time,"I liked this cd, but not as well as did my other David Benoit cds. I guess because it's Christmas and I only listen to it once a year. I still recommend its purchase!!!"
3,good jazz christmas piano music,"I like the music on this CD. However, it all pales in comparison to my favorite David Benoit rendition of Carol of the Bells, which is not on this CD. Now that's a CD I really want to hear."
5,Ahhh Yes!,"This is the Christmas jazz CD I have been looking for. It is not too smooth nor too ""out there,"" but in between. Highly recommended."
2,Benoit adds nothing to Christmas music,"The album is mostly a rehash of Vince Giraldi, so why not stick with the original. There are some indepent songs, but a try at uniqueness ends in just a jumble."
2,Limited usefulness,"I thought the interior of the book was over-designed and aesthetically offensive. It took me a while to learn how to ignore it. The principles and considerations delivered in the book seemed pretty solid, but I felt that the book was starting to get behind the technology curve. A 1998 book on screen display doesn't do justice to what's being successfully done in 2005.I wouldn't have bought the book if I knew exactly what it would be like, but that's in part because I just don't like the style the book is done in and espouses. Too modern, too small, too smart. . .other people like the style more than I.Arlan"
2,"Great toy, Bad construction.","We had the same issue as some of the other reviewers. The handle on the toy broke within about 4 minutes of having the toy out of the package.Our daughter got tired of trying to deal with the broken barn, so eventually she took the animals and played with them by themselves. The animals are the reason for 2 stars rather than one.Ours is also not painted well at all. Very little of the paint actually follows the line of the toy."
5,Durable (and SAFE) Toy!!!!!,I am not sure what the previous reviewer is thinking! Of course there are no nails - This company clearly knows what they are doing! They only make safe products.... I also found the barn to very durable. My son is very rough with his toys and this barn has stood up to the test!
2,Beautiful toy with a major flaw,"The barn is lovely - with great animals, BUT the hinges broke the first time it was picked up by my son. We tried to fix it, but the wood at that point is too thin. My son is very gentle on toys - this is the first he has broken - so it is definately a design fault."
5,A Must Have For Anyone In Critical Care or Invasive Areas,"This was great, I love to diagrams and the step by step procedures. The break down of Traumas and body systems are beyond compair. You will love this book if you are into TRAUMA>>>"
2,Hard to follow,This is the third book in this series. If you havent read the other two like I didnt then you will have no idea what is going on. This is all about World War One I didnt enjoy the story and couldnt follow it very well. There is about 6 different stories going on. I didnt even finish. I think this is a good series but you have to start with the first bok.
2,Interesting,Good book. Had to get it for an class. Okay read if you are interested in this field a very clear and condensed history and explaination. Easy to follow and understand
1,"Excuses, excuses","I knew after reading the overview, I would completly disagree with this book. I find it hard to belive that the author really thinks that blacks are the only race overviewed for statistics. Its not a coincidence when statistics show that a particular race may lean towards the less desiarable end on any matter. Whites, Hispanics, Asians, ect are all overviewed. It disgusts me when I hear more and more excuses for the way people can act or live. If the rape rate or murder rate for african american males is higher than with any other race, it is automatically ludacrist just because they're black, well I find THAT ludacrist. Instead of getting angry because the truth is exposed for everyone to see, mabye the right action would be to try and change what a person could, but I doubt that will ever happen."
4,I'm a penny-pincher (so sue me).,"TREMOLO is a little better then the EP GLIDER, but it still feels a little expensive at seven or eight dollars. This EP clocks in at slightly under twenty minutes, and one of the songs on this disc is an almost exact version of a track from LOVELESS (it has an extended ending, which is pretty sweet, but besides that, the tracks are identical). If you own LOVELESS, there is no real reason to buy this EP (unless you're a hardcore Valentine fan such as myself). You'll only be getting about 15 minutes of new songs, and although they (""Swallow"" and ""Honey Power"" are among the better tracks) are better then any of the songs off of the EP GLIDER, they're still below anything on LOVELESS or ISN'T ANYTHING. Don't get me wrong, this EP is excellent, it's just not worth the price."
3,Good if you have a strong math background,"This book really shouldn't be a ""C version"" for it contains very few C example codes, concentrating mostly on the maths side of CG. It also isn't a book for someone who doesn't have a strong mathematical background, it does not explan why something is that way or anything, it just puts the formulas there and a brief explanation of everything. It's not a book to be used as your only reference, and the Appendix on maths background is not very explaining unless you already know all that(making it useless)."
4,Good for Reference,It's a solid introduction to computer graphics. It might be a little dated now but it still serves as a good reference. I used it when I took my computer graphics class in college and I recently bought a used copy from Amazon so I have a fresh copy of it.
4,Needed more C code,"The 3-D concepts aren't explained well. And yes, C code's sure lacking. I will give it 4 stars, because of the good explanations that accompany the 2-D chapters.I would have given it 5 stars had it featured more sample code (and yes, well documented too), and had the 3-D sections been more lucidly explained."
3,Seems a bit outdated.,"This book is in sore need of an update! Much of the pictures and info is from the early 90's and has changed quite a bit. However, the parts describing the non-changing algorithms seem fairly well written."
1,"Works great, until it breaks","This masher worked great the few times I used it, then the handle came off while I was using it the other day. I don't think I even used it a half dozen times. I guess you get what you pay for. Not recommended."
3,Micro Fiber Towels,They work great. And Arrived quickly. My only complain is that they are pretty small. They work great as a gym towel.
5,Microfiber Towel,"We had a small microfiber towel that we used to wipe down the tile after a shower. We wanted a larger one. This towel is all that we expected.However, we had expected a somewhat darker color."
5,Does what it's supposed to!,"Took this thing camping, to the gym, around the house... does what it's supposed to. Absorb like crazy and dry really fast. I intend to get some more smaller sizes for camping!"
1,"Uncomfortable, poor absorption","This thing feels terrible against skin. My girlfriend won't use it, and I'll only use it if it's the only option. Also, I was expecting it to be super absorbent and easily wrung-out. I was wrong on both counts. It's less absorbent than the cheap cotton towels I usually take. Also, it doesn't wring-out very easily or completely. It was still extremely wet and heavy even after I exerted a high degree of torque attempting to twist the water out of the towel. The only positive point I could find was that it did dry more quickly than the cotton towels, but since I rarely need to dry a towel quickly, that's not a big gain when rubbing a plastic/rubber sheet against my skin. I am not pleased with this product and cannot recommend it. Cotton towels feel better against your skin and if they get lost or destroyed, it's no big loss since they don't cost much. This microfiber towel skips across the skin like a sheet of rubber, isn't very absorbent, and has a much higher cost."
2,not a soft towel!,these towels are not soft as a regular towel. they do absorb water and get heavy....but are not your typical towel by any length of the imagination!
2,Not sent the size advertised,"I ordered two of these towels, both through Amazon, but from different companies. One was the regular size (19 x 39) but that is a bit small for me, so I ordered this one, which SAID it was extra large 29 x 55. It is not. It just the standard smaller size. I will keep it, but am very disappointed as I wanted the bigger one. Not worth returning it."
5,Great for high traffic bathroom,"I was a little worried about buying this product after reading some of the other reviews, but I'm glad I did buy it. The towel is perfect for my high-traffic bathroom. It feels just fine when your hands are wet and dries effectively. When folded lengthwise, it is just the right width to look good on my towel bar, and the dark color will not stain if someone is a careless washer and has missed rinsing off some wet dirt. In the linen closet, it takes up little space, unlike my thick terry towels. Additionally, the terry towels I am gradually replacing were always wet, and this towel dries quickly. I plan on buying more of these towels; the animal shelter will be the recipient of my terry towels so I don't feel guilty about replacing towels in good condition."
5,The Perfect Towel,"This towel is very absorbent, it dries quickly, it holds up very well (no fabric softener needed), it feels good against your skin, and it doesn't take up much room in your linen closet. What more could you ask for in a towel? Worth the price."
3,"Great for camping, too austere for the home bathroom","Maybe I was expecting too much.But I tried this out in my bathroom and found...GOOD:- Light- Does dry my body well when rubbed against me closely.- No fluff/lint/anything residue'd on my body.NOT-SO-GOOD:- Just doesn't feel comfy- Have to carefully press it against me to get the drying benefit (unlike a towel that I can sort of flail around)If I have the opportunity to use this in situations where saving weight or quick drying is critical, I probably upgrade this to four stars. But for now, it's just underwhelming :("
2,I see a trend here,"This is the second book I've read by Dr. Petrisko (The Fatima Prophecies) and, while interesting, I have found his writing style to be a bit sensationalistic and not very well thought out. I found this book to be a disjointed attempt to create a patchwork of content collected from multiple sources into a single logical discourse on the importance of the Eucharist in our lives. I think his approach falls short of the goal. I'd say well over a third of this book is not even Dr. Petrisko's own original content, but collections of other writers and visionaries. While it is all very interesting and thought-provoking, I think Dr. Petrisko lays out just enough information on a particular topic to get the reader interested and then leaves him hanging."
3,Totally satisfied so far.,"The batteries arrived in a reasonable time, and so far they are holding charge and working very nicely."
2,If you thought teaching writing was maddening...,"..try getting through this book. While Claggett has clearly honed her ideas through her teaching career, the presentation is muddled; the order arbitrary; the design confusing; and the book structure, with a series of mini-chapters that is the equivalent of stop-and-go highway traffic, cloying. Deborah Dean's ""Strategic Writing"" is not without its flaws, but it is undoubtedly a more fully realized version of secondary writing instruction."
3,disgruntled customer,I requested a return on the above item 10 days ago - still have not been shipped the return slip. Called your 800 number and talked to a representative who was to send me a return sticker for this item. I will turn this over if I need to. Your web site is impossible to get ahold of anybody - it goes in circles.Get me the return label!!!Jeanie
4,True gift for any child,This kitchen is a blast for any child with an imagination. Our daughter loves to pretend she is cooking us breakfast on the stove. She loves to wash her hands when she hears the water. The sounds of Popcorn popping in the microwave is also a neat feature. It is a well built easy to put together toy for a boy or a girl.
4,Interactive Fun Kitchen,"We purchased this kitchen for our son for Christmas. We did hours of research and compared tons of kitchens. We really didn't want a plastic kitchen, but none of the wooden ones make any sounds. We knew our little guy would have more fun with the kitchen if it made noise. And we were right, he has been having a great time putting food on the stove and turning the knob to make it cook. He loves turning on the microwave as well. I wish that the phone made noise (I replaced it with one that does) and it would be nice if one or two other features (i.e. the coffee maker or water dispenser in the fridge) made noise also. The kitchen definitely seems durable. Our little boy is rough and the kitchen looks like its going to withstand it. : ) The colors are nice for a unisex kitchen. We are very happy with our decision overall."
5,Great fun for kids 2 and up!,"My two-year-old daughter received this for her birthday and she immediately took to it... We could not drag her away to play party games with the other kids!Big pluses for parents: It's durable and sturdy, no worries about kids hurting themselves. Also, it's easy to put together. Took me about twenty minutes.My only concern, as with any children's toy, is that there are loose parts that might get lost... These are food items, which could be easily replaced by generic kitchen-type toys. The only parts you would not want your kids to misplace are the foods (eggs/bacon, spaghetti, mac & cheese) which trigger the cooking sounds.But I'm not sure I have to worry about those loose parts. My daughter made sure all of the foods, dishes, and pans were put away in the various storage areas of the kitchen. She was very particular about this.All in all, a great play item for the kids. They can put their imagination to full use on this toy!"
5,Very Sturdy and easy to assemble!!,"This product was VERY easy to put together, took under 30 minutes and it is made to last! I went to the store to buy the Sweet Magic Kitchen but when I saw the one they had on display it was very poorly made, this one was right next to it on display and what a difference!! For the extra 10.00 this is WELL worth it! My daughter loves all the sounds it makes."
3,Wee kitchen - big job,This was a birthday present for my grandson's third birthday. He has an older sister and a father who likes cooking.It was well received and the children played with it quite a lot over the time I was there on a visit.I thought the shelf area could have been broader. It does invite playdough!The biggest problem was putting it all together. It took my daughter and granddaughter each one and a half hours to put it together. One of the attractions of this toy had been the fact that this make has always been easy to assemble.
2,A Big Disappointment,"We bought this kitchen for our daughter's second birthday and it is a huge disappointment. The oven and dishwasher open like the refrigerator and don't mimic the real version at all. My daughter loves to play with the Little Tikes MagiCook Kitchen at her grandparents house, but doesn't have near as much fun with this kitchen. We are now looking at the Step 2 Kitchens which have more life-like features and look to be more fun for her to play with.A note if you do get this product, do place clear tape over the voice box as it is very loud without it. A reviewer recommended this and it really made it much more enjoyable."
4,"My review, part I","Product was for my kids. Bought it thru Amazon because shipping was half that of Target. Overall, it was OK to put together. It was annoying that I had to dig out the drill to predrill holes for the screws.When the box arrived, I was worried that pieces were missing since part of the tape had been ripped and you could see in to the box. It's a good thing there wasn't anything breakable in the box."
4,Good kitchen but the electronic voice is obnoxious,"Overall this is a great kitchen if you don't put batteries in it. My husband and I couldn't believe it when we found this kitchen on green tag clearance at our local Toys R Us ($40) before Christmas. It was easy to assemble. However, when we tried it out we were not please with the electronic voice. It constantly directs play which limits a child's creativity. We took out the batteries for the stove and left the batteries in for the microwave. Our 20 month old daughter and her friends love playing with it. She especially loves ""talking"" on the phone while stirring a pot on the stove.ProsEasy to assembleLarge kitchen that grows with your childcomes with soem implementswe foudn the storage spaces to be adequateConsElectronic voice"
5,cheapest shipping available,I have spent days looking for this kitchen both online and in retail stores. It was not available in the stores in my area so I checked countless toy websites seeking the cheapest shipping. At www.hsn.com the shipping was only $13.99.My total cost was $117.
2,Returned after putting together,"I purchased this toy for my 2year old daughter. This kitchen was very easy to put together, took only about a half hour or so. The thing I did not like about this kitchen was the doors were extreamly hard for me to open. The microwave was also hard to open, and the space was very small. If I can't open the doors how would a 2year old do it!So, I am returning this kitchen and purchasing the lifestyle dream kitchen. It seems to get better reviews.I hope this helps."
5,Great!,"This was recommended to us by my 2 yr old son's occupational and developmental therapists, to increase his range of motion, and teach him to do purposeful things.He's 3 now and still loves to play with this kitchen, as does his 4 yr old brother. It was very easy to put together, we've had it for a year now, and not had a single problem with it. We chose this kitchen in particular because of the things it does, and that it's not a ""girly"" toy like some of the kitchens are.Ours did come with one pot, one skillet, one spatula, and one pair of tongs--so I'm a little surprised to see that someone else mentioned not getting those items with theirs. It did also come with some foods, though I wish there was a better range of them--or perhaps extra sets we could purchase for it. (if there are any, I have yet to find them on Amazon)"
2,Assembly not easy,"I found the connecting wire between the tap and the stove a struggle because the instructions sequence your actions so that the tap is screwed down first. However, the connection from tap to stove cannot be secured unless the tap is fixed into position after the stove. Even then, I had to use decorator's tape to hold the connector into the stove.A power tool is really needed to complete this job effortlessly. With it the assembly should be quick if the connection discussed above was a simple matter. Finally some of the stickers are not easily attached.Now it is assembled, I hope it stays together!!"
3,I am disappointed...,"This kitchen is okay, I guess...I agree with the other reviewer who said ""no way does this thing make 40 sounds"". Maybe if you count each syllable???There is nothing great about this kitchen. It seems fine. We got it as an upgrade to a hand me down kitchen, thinking my daughter who is 2 1/2 would be drawn to a kitchen with more features, and she really couldn't care less about this kitchen. So I guess if you are looking to spend under $[...], and just want a play kitchen, this one is fine, and it is complete, but it is nothing to rave about..."
5,Mixed Feelings,"Disclaimer: I don't read LKH sex scenes anymore. They are kind of boring. Not because I think they are poorly written, just not my cup of tea. I just check to make sure nothing interesting or plot relevant is going on and move forward.Having said that, I thought this book was good. I'm only into LKH for the blood, violence, and magical powers. This book had them by the fistful. I enjoy the side notes about the fey legends that are thrown in and the general research that comes through in the writing.It was a short read though (especially with all the skipping) and I feel none of the major events were really explored in the detail they deserved. Hopefully they will be addressed in the next book. (I have a real hankering for another well-written 500+ paged book by LKH. Ohhh, I just had a mind-gasm thinking about it.)"
4,a matter of balance,"This fifth book in the ongoing Merry Gentry series by Laurell K. Hamiliton is an improvement but more so since it has some actual character developement in it besides the as usual nice sex scenes. However this should indeed have been the back half of Book 4, not book 5. While it good, I do not think it warranted a book of its own, especially as it takes up almost literally in the next paragraph from the last one.I've always enjoyed LKH's worlds, but I find I'm getting increasingly out of patience with the continuing sex scenes and the plots wandering if at all existent. The Merry Gentry series seems to be a bit better than her Anita series, simply because there is a timeline and eventual goal to the whole series as opposed to the Anita books, which have become simply the continuing adventures and soap opera of a very interesting world.LKH is excellent at creating worlds and characters, but she really needs to get back to a goal and end focus for each book."
3,I was a little worried...,"When I first read the reviews for this, I was a little worried that this installment was going to be like ""Mica"" in the Anita Blake Series.A lot of people were upset that the story did not seem to move along. And Merry has not made it to her uncle's ball yet. I read the book yesterday and it seems to me that the time for the ball has not arrived yet. I know that time moves differently in the ""sithen"" but it seemed like not a whole lot of time had pasted in their world... maybe a day or two.I figure I'll stick it out another couple of books..."
1,Fed up and disappointed (Again!),"I can't believe I paid this much for a book with so little substance! I used to love the Merry Gentry series and thought that hopefully this series would not become as huge of a disappointment as the Anita Blake one has. I was completely wrong! It sort of had a plot from what I could discern around the sex scenes however, the book was so brief as to almost be pointless. I am done with Laurell Hamilton!"
1,Another Disappointment,"I debated whether to give this book 1 or 2 stars. At first I was going to give it 2 stars as I thought LKH did a better job with this book than she did with the ABVH book Danse Macabre. I settled on 1 star after thinking about all of the things that bothered and/or disappointed me about this book.My biggest problem were the scenes with Sholto. I hated what she did to him which I'm not going to say because I don't want to give anything away. However, to me it seemed like LKH was taking the easy way out. She took away any ""specialness"" and made it ""ordinary"". The scenes between Merry and Sholto could have been Merry and AnyGuy.There were many other disappointments for me in this book. I'm not sure if the deficiencies of Mistral's Kiss were magnified for me as I had just finished reading a number of books (the latest from Kim Harrison, JR Ward and Lynsay Sands to start) which, IMO, were head and shoulders above anything coming from LKH lately."
2,Disappointing...,"I have been a great fan of Hamilton's work but it almost seems as though Hamilton is just trying to make money with 'Mistral's Kiss' by drawing it out over a couple of hours where nothing much happens except sex and explaining information we already know. Please Hamilton, try not to spoil this series. Give your reader something with meat in which she can sink her teeth into and find some satisfaction because right now the impression you're giving is not one of an author concerned with crafting a great story and character but one who cares only about generating quick, short books with an eye just for profit."
2,Disappointment,"The book is short, and has essentially no plot development; the entire story fits into about 12 hours, enough for a little running around, a little more interior decoration through sex, and plenty of kinky sex--some rough, some tentacular. And disappoingly, the tentacles are only present in spirit.At the end, everybody is home in LA again, giving some hope that the next story may have a little less Redecoration of Faerie and a little more plot."
2,Still hungry...,"I am a terrific fan of the world that LKH created in the Merrie Gentry series, and looked forward to following Merrie's sexual encounter with the goblin brothers, the pregnancy contest with Cel, the visit to the Shining Court, the visit to the Goblin Court, the resolution of who will rule the Unseelie Sidhe, the romance of Doyle, Frost and even Galen...all of the intriguing plotlines that LKH weaves so well. But those were hardly mentioned. While Mistral's Kiss moves the ball forward with the reawakening of the sithen (but now that it's awake, what now?), the seductive Mistral (although his fate is left hanging), and the rise of King Sholto (but what does that mean to the Unseelie Court?), it ends in a rushed conclusion that leaves alot of dangling, unfinished threads.I am still an LKH fan. I hope she won't leave us hanging! I will watch for her next, hopefully much longer, much more satisfying, novel."
2,So disappointing,"I wanted to love this book as I loved the first two Merry books. I waited and pre-ordered and read Laurell's blog every day for tidbits until finally the book arrived on my doorstep. What a let-down! The series plot hardly advances at all, it felt like a rehash of the previous book, and things seem slap-dash and unfinished at the end. If this had been the quality of the first Merry book, it never would have been enough to get me hooked. And I really, really, really had been looking forward to this installment in the series."
1,Could I have gotten a kiss first.?,"You know the saying, ""A fool and his money are easily parted.""Well, let me introduce myself, ""Hello, my name is Fool."" I cannot believe I fell for the okey doke.I mean really Curious George has more movement then this book.Seasame Street has more movement then this book.Teletubbies has more movement than this book.Before I get yelled at, I'm not talking about horizontal acrobatics, I can purchase a copy of Hustler and get better written sex scenes.I've spent nearly thirty bucks, reading about Merry flouncing around the sithen, bringing things back to life, like Jenna Jameson ala Cordelia from Angel, with a bag of Miracle Grow and a bunch of long, haired Anime boys posturing and jockeying for a position in her bed.How many more books before we get to visit Unkie Taranis, was that not the entire premise of the visit to Illinois or am I the only one who remembers that."
1,I've written longer term papers,"Like so many others I love these books, I also like the Anita Blake stories. However, if one were to pay attention to the page size, extra large font size, spacing between characters and spacing between lines you'd notice that this isn't really even a 212 page book. It's far shorter. It is more like a few chapters, and not a novel. Certainly not worth the hard-cover price. I played these same games in college, I know them when I see them.This is the last time I will purchase one of these books sight unseen. Next time I'll view it in the store and see if she's playing the same games. If she is, I'll wait and get it from the library, or borrow it from a friend, or get it in paperback. I work too hard for my money to be taken advantage of like this."
3,I'm not buying the next one in hardback either,"I agree with the other reviewers - this book is flat, the sex is getting boring with no emotional content and it's moving beyond my ""ick"" threshold (though the author does a very good job of writing these scenes) and the plot is not progressing. This really is just part of a book that would be worth buying.The publishers should take notice - many of us will probably wait for the paperback or borrow this from a library rather than spending on the hardback for the next book."
3,"Fast read, but disappointing","I didn't think I'd ever say I'm disappointed in a LKH book, but this one should have been the last part of Stroke of Midnight. It's more of a tease than a novel. (actually, it's more novella length.)I was first attracted to the series because the idea of a fairy detective in LA was so unique. Now we have left that concept behind and gotten involved in the politics of Faerie. There's nothing wrong with that except that I miss Merry's interaction with her human side. She is more and more sidhe. But that isn't the root of my disappointment. More and more, I feel as if the books are erotic PWP's (Plot? What plot?) I expect more from LKH."
2,Refund,"I must say I got my copy of this book and was horrified. I have waited a year for a book that is normally about 320 or more pages long to get a novella instead!Without talking about the story I have to say this was just a joke. An author I love who at times has disgusted me with losing focus of her own series by not continuing with her own mythology gets a major release (advertising, gets full Hardcover status) for a book that is even smaller than any of her books when she was still being published in paperback. This is a joke! This book should have been released in the $6 paperbacks not as a full scale hardcover edition.I have read children's books better written and with more content than the latest Merry installment.This book should have been pushed back until a full edition was complete."
3,Stuck in a rut.,"I have read every one of Laurell's books in this series and others. If you are looking for Laurell's awe and terror inspiring blend of Magic, Murder, Mayhem and Mystery; Mistral's Kiss isn't it. Laurell seems to be stuck in a rut between her character's legs. I hope there will be more in the upcoming books besides sex. It took almost a third of Mistral's Kiss before we got out of the sex scenes. Gods, I miss the plot lines. Enough with the SEX, we get it; oh terrors, Merry has to get preggers! I don't mean to say that there isn't exciting portions of the book. After all Prince Cel presents a terrible threat to Merry."
3,My Masters Thesis Was LONGER!!!,"Don't get me wrong...I do so like the land of faerie, but at a dismal 212 pages, me thinks someone ""phoned it in"". My MA thesis on the Lithographs of Henri Matisse and their reflection of then-contemporary sexual mores was longer than the Mistral's Kiss!I like Merry's world vs. Anita's - although she does smack of Anita - she has THE attitude and many, many, many sex partners although not the commitment-phobe that Anita is. I so hope the next book is longer *sigh*. Maybe I'll trip on off to the Unseelie Court while I wait. ;)"
3,MEREDITH GENTRY FIVE,"Let me summarize MISTRAL'S KISS. One hundred pages of sex, one hundred plus pages on entering by accident the land of the sluagh and King Sholto,some trouble, more sex, meet some gods, one hundred pages for a run from slaugh wild hunt, talk to the queen and get ordered back to the west coast. Thats it. I agree with some others, this book could be chapters in another. Disappointing. At least half was erotica. Reluctantly on to book six."
3,"Shorter than I'd like, but worth the read, at any length","I've read the book a second time, and truly wish I could raise my rating to at least 4 stars, if not 5. LKH puts her heart and soul into these beautiful characters, and it's evident in this book. I now realize that, at any length, her books would be too short for me, as I'd love to just keep turning the pages, over and over, finding out what happens next. Sure, there are parts I'm not entirely sure about, but in the end, she makes everything mesh, and it all comes together to make sense. Thanks, Laurell."
1,Terrible,Another dismissal failure from an author who once had so much talent. I can't spend anymore money on this garbage. I quit.
3,Too short,This really should have been the end of the book prior to this one it ties in to it entirely too well. While I did enjoy it I wish it would have just continued in the other book so I could have saved the eight bucks. Merry finds herself unleashing even more magic with people she's not sure of and at times or send there is entirely too much sex and not enough action. However the end was very good.
5,This book is a joy to read!,"I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book. It is well written, with a fascinating storyline, interesting characters and a fast- moving plot. One is definitely left wanting more."
3,So many men...,"This series is a lot of men, with a lot of sex. I intend to finish the series,but it's not as good as the Anita Blake Vampire Hunter series"
3,It was ok,"Overall, I like the Meredith Gentry series. I don't have a problem with the numerous sex scenes as they're a large part of the on-going plot arc. I think the ever-growing number of partners gets a little silly, but again, it's fun and the plot is set. I have two major complaints that make me give the book a ""3"" rating. First is the length. I read the book at the library so I can't claim to be cheated, but having a novella published at the same price as a full novel is ridiculous. The second complaint is that plot lines are started and then seemingly dropped for lack of interest. I like loose ends, but I think the threads should be addressed from book to book."
2,slipperly slope down,I read the reviews and was so sorry to hear Ms Hamilton is producing soft porn only these days. When i first became aware of her books they had plot and sex. i like both. but if this is like Micah you will feel ripped off i did and the last Anita Blake was all sex. Her books getting shorter and shorter.I saw that her Anita Blake books are being down in graphic/comic book style. perhaps she should now stick to that format since her books are so short.regretfully.. where i once preordered i will now wait till they hit the library
3,Too Short,"This novel is too short at 224 pages. Merideth's visit to the Seelie Sithen and confrontation with King Taranis is MIA and is long overdue. Hamilton needs to be able to cover a bit more ground (like 350 pages worth). That said however, this book has some excellent elements. Firstly, the quality of the sex scenes has become very good once again as it was in the very first Merideth Gentry novel. The sex scenes in the past few Laurell K. Hamilton novels have been sub standard. Secondly, I like the magical aspects in this novel. They are quite unique. It seems that Hamilton is breaking out of restrictive molds and is becoming more creative.I have one pet peeve in this entire series. I wonder why would such powerful and deadly sidhe like Doyle, Barinthius, Rhys, and Mistral would continue to fear Queen Andais so much and still willingly take her abuse when their great ancient powers have returned.In conclusion, if it were not for the brevity of this novel, it would have gotten 4 stars."
4,can't wait for the next book,"I love reading Laurell K. Hamilton's books!! This series is excellent and I have been waiting for Mistral's Kiss to be released. I read it in one sitting and then went back and re-read the previous 4 books in the series. LOVE THEM!! Meredith Gentry is a character that catches your interest, and all her men....yummy!! Can't wait until book 6 comes out!!!"
5,A wonderfull book,This was a wonderfull book but you have to read all of the series before it to really understand. Ive read all of them at least three times. You will enjoy the story its fun and sexy. The best thing about it is that it brings the world today and mixes it with the Fay. I advise to read it. I couldnt put it down its just that good.
2,Wow.,"As most of my fellow reviewers said, this story is mostly erotica, and I think should have been combined with A Lick of Frost.some interesting things happen, but not really much but fluff, sex, and *SPOILER* Sholto, who finally returns. *ENDSPOILER* It's important to the series and plot, so if you want to know what the heck is happening in A Lick of Frost, you might want to read it.Other than that, I can't recomend it."
2,Too short!,I agree with several people here. This book lacks scope! It is simply another 36 (maybe that long) hrs of time added to the last book. It should have been added to the pevious book or sent to the readers in a paperback. I enjoy LKH's work but this book was too short for the money. It seems like the series is stalling and a book of some substance is what we are looking for. I really hope the next book covers more than the entourage's trip in the cab........
2,Is this an actual book or just a chapter? Where's the beef?,"This was only part of a book, not a book unto itself. Where is the rest?I kept waiting for something to really happen in this novelette. Something big. Yes, this answered the question of what happened to Sholto. What's with the wild hunt chasing Merry? How did this advance the plot and why were the goblins just randomly wandering around in force? What we got was the wild hunt getting turned into dogs (intriguing but pointless), more sex (ditch Mistral, been there/done that), and finally at the very end, Cel got out of jail & Andais told Merry to go back to LA. We got a few tidbits thrown in that I really appreciated (how she's feeling about Doyle, etc), but I thought this was just not worth waiting for. Sad, but true."
2,It left me wanting way more...,I was soooo excited when I learned that there was finally going to be another Merry Gentry novel and I have to say I was rather disappointed. It was to short and it didn't really progress as much as I thought it would. It really left me wanting way more and I have to wonder why I spent the money on it because it almost wasn't worth it.
2,"This was a novella, not a novel.","To short, to pricey, and to much sex. Unfortunately I had ordered the book from amazon, if I had seen it first there is no way that I would have bought it. This will be last of LKH's books I buy unseen, as another reviewer has already commented her next book will be read in the book store without buying it. Finally I am getting just a little tired of the ongoing adventures of slot-machine shiela, enough with the sex already, lets have some plot and story developement instead. I would not be nearly so p-----o---ed if this had been published like Micah as a paperback."
2,Disappointed,"I'm more a fan of Laurell's characters than her writing. However, in this book the characters are f-l-a-t. It takes place over less than 24 hours. There is zero plot - just one sex scene after another. I give the book the two stars because Laurell does come up with multiple ways to write a sex scene - something that is not easy to do. Aside from a dream sequence, I don't believe Meredith wears a stitch of clothes throughout.I am quickly losing interest in Meredith Gentry. I'll give the series one more book."
1,$10 top bid on Ebay,"Just wait till the paperback comes out or it tops out on Ebay at $10 since it's a 3 act play and there are porn magazines with more plot than the latest writing of LKH.Gosh--I wish she'd go back to writing stories instead of the collections of wet dreams that she's been churning out for the past few years. She's sitting on a gold mine of smart, funny female characters that have clearly lost their way and am sure that both Merry and Anita would love some sharp witty dialogue besides oh baby, oh baby.Catch it on sale.."
2,A novel going nowhere,I have to say that this is my least favourite of the Meredith Gentry books as it really didn't go anywhere or add anything to the story. I really wish that Laurell K Hamilton would put in a little less sex and a lot more storyline (or make the book longer and have both). This book completely fails to advance the storyline as I was expecting this book to contain at least the visit to the Seelie court. I was very disappointed.
1,"Merry, Merry, where ha' ye gone?","After reading the latest installment in the Merry Gentry series, it appears that Laurell K. Hamilton has decided to make it more like her current Anita Blake offerings. Meaning of course virtually no plot and almost continual *and rather boring* sex.Events mentioned in 'A Stroke of Midnight' promised that 'Mistral's Kiss' could be an action packed, exciting addition to the series. Alas, my hopes were not realized and except for character and location name changes 'Mistral's Kiss' could have been 'Danse Macabre' re-released.For the future I'm sticking with Carrie Vaughn, Patricia Briggs and Kim Harrison. I'm done with LKH."
2,Wrong size,"The moment I opened my package with this book I thought that there must have been made a mistake. It look far to thin and I kind of hoped that the real book still should be coming. Just barely 200 pages and I had been waiting so long for it. The writing style is perfect and draws me in right from first page, but the events don't seem to be in proportion. I rather had the revelations and explinations longer and sexscenes shorter. Next time I will wait for the cheaper paperback cause to me it wasn't worth the money."
2,ARE YOU SERIOUS???,...I waited how long for this book when it could have just been stapled to the end of the previous book. I have never written a review but after this I could remain silent! I love Merry (I love Frost) but I m sorry to say it was a let down :( one of the reasons the dark hunter series is now my favorite fix!! But you still have to read it to continue with the series I say borrow it from a friend if you can!!
2,Enough already!,"Alright, this is the last time I buy one of LKH books new, even from Amazon, from now on, used only, I'd rather spend the money buying the latest Kim Harrison hardcover. I know LKH doesn't care anymore, she's just collecting a paycheck, I encourage all others like me who are waiting for her books to get better to just buy them either in paperback or used maybe then she and her publisher will get the hint.Her books should be moved to the erotica category and not be put in with the regular books."
2,Don't buy this! Wait for the paperback,"Or better yet, get it from the library and save your money. I read it in one evening, that's right one. It consited of two very long sex scenes. Ok maybe there were three but it's hard to tell when one begins and the other one ends. Really, you can do without this one. You won't miss but a pinch of the on going plot. I was extremely dissapointed in this book. There was almost no substance. I know this stuff is light fluffy reading. To be honest I skip over most of the sex because it's starting to bore me to tears but I do like the Merry and the plot (when it exists) is quite different from other 'fairy' books I've read. But this? BIG waste of money. I only gave it two stars because I needed a book fix and it did the trick but it's like eating really cheap crappy chocolate when there's no Godiva....regret and a bad taste in your mouth"
2,why?,"Please tell me why I actually paid for this book? Like everyone else here I am invested in Merry. The first two books took me on a rollar coaster ride and I couldnt wait to get to the next book. Now i'm just wishing the end would HURRY up and get here. How about a book that goes somewhere? Better yet, how about a book at all. I think somewhere along the way LKH lost the plot and forgot why she was writing this story. I hope she finds it again. But from now on, I will wait till it goes to paperback and get it at the discount bin. I'm tired of spending 17-25 dollars of my hard earned money for this one - two scene crapola."
1,boring ridiculous soft core,"I like the first book of this series, unfortunately like her other series with Anita Blake, it's basically soft core at this point. I'm not looking for that in my trashy vampire/fairy/supernatural books. I've moved on to teen supernatural books where they still have plots instead of one scene after another with group sex as all Ms. Hamilton's books do at this point.If your reading this Ms. Hamilton, please lose the soft core porn. It bores me."
2,"I love the series, but this book dissappointed me","I love the Meredith Gentry series. I've read it several times. But I have no desire to reread Mistral's Kiss.Usually I can remember scenes vividly, but this book I can barely remember. Sholto was fascinating in the first book, but he bored me in Mistral's Kiss. Sholto's character development just didn't seem real. Even Mistral is boring in this book.I can't pin point what's wrong. But, nobody really did anything that seemed interesting to me. Big plot turns were done in 2 sentences.I'm not a big fan of sex scenes in general, but I like the supernatural parts of Laurell's sex scenes. I love the idea of metaphysical sex. So I was really surprised at my ""ho hum"" reaction to the supernatural sex scenes in Mistral's Kiss."
2,Not a real book,"this should have been called a novelette and priced accordingly, a quick two porn read"
2,We have gotton nowhere!,"To short to be marketed as a novel. Engrossing and imaginative as always but the cliched sayings are the same, the similes are the same, the sex is the same! Let's move on in the plot next time."
1,waste of trees,"Plot? What plot? This book *could* of been great. Merry had a murder to solve, and a new guard, Mistral to play with. However the 'playing' is full of LKH's famous grandstanding which only makes the sex tedious and boring. The murder was forgotten about until page 177....and still does not even come close to being solved...or even mentioned.I feel that LKH just dated raped her fans of $23.95. The book is only 212 pages and 22 chapters. Wait for your local library to have this book in stock, it is not worth your hard earned cash."
2,Does not deliver,"I enjoy the Meredith Gentry series. I looked forward to this book hitting the market.I felt it was a short story that had to be stretched to make a very short novel. It was obvious that points/scenes were belabored to make this a very short book. This book was way too much of a dissappointment it failed on numerous levels; 1)plot was thin 2) story line was thin 3)way too much sex for so little action. This should have been a part of a larger book, it does not stand well on its own."
2,Disappointing,"I was really looking forward to the continuation of this series and was disappointed to find that Mistral's Kiss did little more than fill out some of the events of the last book. The sex (although arguably sometimes too major a player) has always been imaginative and fun, but the more it drones on in the same theme, even the author seems to be finding it tedious. There is a hint of plot once the sex had been gotten out of the way, but it seemed little more than a rushed afterthought. Finally at a mere 200 pages of medium size type, it is here and gone in a few hours and you can't help but think the author has taken the money to go lay on a beach somewhere and read something far more satisfying. Faerie was a wonderful, rich world and this book does nothing to enhance it. Boo!"
1,Not for everyone,"I like erotica as well as the next person, but this is truly bad. I was given this as a gift, and wished that the person who gave it to me had saved their money. I understand that there are books that come before this one; hopefully they are of better quality. This book has no character development, and exists only to provide sex scenes. I think that the writer probably knocked this one out in 10 minutes or less. Save your time and money and skip this one."
2,A slower publishing pace please.,"This year saw the release of Micah, Danse Macabre, Strange Candy and Mistral's Kiss. Give the woman a break! Clearly the effort of writing two full books a year is too much. The plot suffers horribly. As Ms. Hamilton has a loyal fanbase that will read whatever she writes, perhaps it would help if she could be allowed off of that schedule. Maybe then feedback could be incorporated into the final drafts. Or, if something must be published, she could write a collection of short stories dealing with Anita and Merry. I hope Ms. Hamilton still enjoys writing. I'm begining to doubt it."
2,Don't waste your money.,"I was so looking forward to the next installment of this series. I enjoy LKH's writing and truly enjoy the extensive love scenes she throws in. So, I knew what to expect before buying this one. BUT, it is only 200 pages long and I would say that 160 pages were one long involved sex scene. PLEASE! You would think Merry would be chafed raw by page 100. I could overlook that but the plot does not move an inch forward. I was really disappointed and I agree with many of the other reviewers, I won't be buying any more LKH books."
2,Come On LKH,I agree this book was much too short for a hardcover. Also as previously mentioned lately there has been ZERO CLOSURE. I mean there are so many things still hanging in the air ends that need to be tied up. In the Merry and Anita books. They are no longer standalones. This Merry book does seem like an intermezzo/future plot builder. I finished it feeling unsatisfied and as if like someone mentioned earlier we have been on the same night of Merry's life for the last three books. I would have preffered more plot and less sex. I would reccommend anyone just starting the series to start from the beggining or you will be lost. The next book had better be dynamic and up to usual LKH style or I will start to become disillusioned.
1,LKH owes me a refund!,"I would have given this zero stars, but did not have that option so one will have to do. I will not spend another cent lining the pockets of an auther more interested in the bottom line than keeping her fan base. This book had no plot, the sex was a complete turn-off, and Merry has fallen into the mundane. And boys and girls you get all of this for the discount price of $23.95! Wow! Just think, I could have had a great pedicure and read something intelectually stimulating instead of wasting 2 hrs trying to find a plot. This was actually the end of book 4, but LKH and her publisher thought her fan base would be too stupid to notice. Hmmmm, Big mistake. Big!"
5,TERRIFIC,"I WAS AN ANITA BLAKE FAN, MERRY MAY BE EVEN BETTER. EACH BOOK IN THIS SERIES IS BETTER THAN THE LAST."
4,Minstral's Kiss,"I love Merrie's adventures, though the plot is thinning out with this sieres. I enjoy them even more because I treat myself to the audio versions so I can listen to them in the car. I drive alot and find that they keep me company and before I know it I'm where I need to be."
5,Enticing Read,I love Laurell Hamilton's books and this one was no disappointment. I find that with each book the character development pulls me even deeper into the story and keeps me chomping at the bit for the next book. Only complaint I can think of is that it ended too abruptly.
1,"Personally, I'd like my money back...","Yes, it's partly my fault. I did buy it despite the negative reviews, but I thought ""How bad could it really be?"" EXTREMELY BAD, as I found out. The book was a travesty - no lot to speak of. And no, rabif LKH lovers, it wasn't the sex that bothered me (though god knows someone should give this woman a few good erotica novels so she knows how sex scenes should be described, even a decent romance novel maybe), it was the complete and utter lack of a PLOT. I beg everyone, for the good of the genre, stop buying her books - perhaps then her publishers will stop having the gall to put out this shoddy work in hardcover and attempt to rip us off for $20."
2,"This time, the author gives us only half a book, and no plot advancement","I really enjoyed the first four books of this series, but book 5 annoyed me, because it's way too short (just over 200 pages), and it only covers perhaps a half day of real time in the story ... during which very little in the way of plot advancement happens.Don't get me wrong - the erotica's equally on par with all that's occured in the first four books ... but erotica is not enough. There needs to be some plot advancement !I feel like the author has deliberately slowed down the pace of her story, and has fobbed off only half a novel on her readers ... and charged them full price for it. Although enjoyable to read, I felt very cheated. I'd wait til this one comes out in used paperback ... this one isn't worth full price, much less hardcover prices."
2,Too brief in content & form,"I normally love all of LKH's work - both Merry and Anita. I don't have serious issues with the amount of sex in the series, either, but I did not like this book. It didn't feel like anything was answered here - what happened to the accusation that Rhys assaulted a Seelie woman at the end of the last book? Dropped. I was very confused about how some of the main characters acted, especially Sholto. I'll stop there because I don't want to give too much away for those who are still planning on reading the book. My bottom line is that it didn't seem like anything original happened in the book - and what did happen was brief and unexplained. It was a very erratic read. I won't be automatically buying the next book in hardcover - I'll read the first few chapters first."
1,Tired of all the sex,"I wish LKH would get back on track. I understand that Merry has to get pregnant but all the sex is getting monotonous. I will have to state that there is at least some plot this time but again the sex is getting ridiculous. She isn't even getting all of her character descriptions correct, for example: Nicca started out having purple hair and lilac skin, now it is brown and brown, Sholto started out with white hair and now it is pale yellow, ""like the sun shining on snow"". I am no longer going to waste money on purchasing the books anymore, same for the Anita books, I am going to get them from the library, when and if her books come back up to the excellence they used to aspire to then I will purchase them again. I do hope that LKH gets things together."
2,That's it?,"When I finished reading this book I was furious. I was actually yelling ""That's it? Only a couple of hours have passed in this book!"" I can't believe I paid full price for this in HARD COVER for crying out loud. I do not recommend spending your money on this book, you will find yourself cheated and dissatisfied."
1,refuse to buy this book,"I bought LKH's last book from the AB series and swore never to buy another of her books (at least nothing new, and also nothing hardbound) ever again. Even so, I'm still addicted to her two series, so I spent about 30 minutes perusing this book at the bookstore, debating whether or not to buy it and enjoy it over my winter break. Like everyone else who's reviewed this book has already said--it's super short and almost all sex. I don't know whether it's her fault or the fault of her publishers for rushing her, but these books are an insult to us, the readers. Do they assume that because we're predominantly females who like romance and fantasy, we're total idiots who are just going to keep on handing over our money as the books get worse and worse? Maybe I'll buy this when it's a paperback for sale for 90 cents. Shouldn't take long."
3,WOW that went quick.,"I am a huge fan of both the Anita Blake and Merry Gentry series, but was kind of let down with this new book. I looked forward to its arrival and finished it within a couple of hours. The book was an early Christmas present from my husband, and I feel it was not worth his efforts to get it for me so fast.I can only hope that her next 2 books have more plot and less sex, because for this fan my anticipation is beginning to wane for them to come out. Mistral's Kiss should have been a paperback novellite and not a hardbound money loss."
3,I feel like the story is bogged down,"We've been living the same night in Merry's life for what seems like the last three books. The story was good, don't get me wrong, but there hasn't been any plot development. It was too short and a bit disappointing."
3,No Conclusion,"I like Laurell's books, both series, this book was ok, but it left me confused, she didnt seem to take the time to break anything down around what was happening"
4,where's the editor,"This book is good and covers a lot of needed info, but it could have very easily been included in the previous book, especially since it was so short and picked up right where the last one left off. At least the sex she has makes sense and isn't sex for sex's sake. She is a fertility goddess after all."
1,NEED MORE,"IF ANYONE FINDS THE REST OF THIS BOOK, PLEASE LET ME KNOW. 212 PAGES, HALF OF THEM SEX, LH IS GETTING LAZY. WHAT PLOT THERE WAS, NOT BAD. SEX, GETTING BORING. PACE, NONEXISTANT. I LOVE THE PREMISE OF THE SERIES. THE FIRST TWO BOOKS WERE GREAT. WHAT HAPPENED????? PLEASE LH WRITE ONE BOOK THAT ACUALLY SAYS SOMETHING. I KNOW I SHOULD STOP READING BUT I JUST CAN'T. I FEEL SO ASHAMED."
2,check it out from the library,"I hardly ever purchase hard-cover books, but since this one came out right before Christmas I asked my husband to get it for me. I talked him into letting me open it early, and when he handed me the package I was sure he handed me the wrong one because it was so THIN. Ugh. I can't believe I fell for the holiday release date marketing ploy. I wish I'd read the reviews posted here before I asked for it because I agree with EVERY negative review. I won't repeat them because everyone else did a terrific job. I don't think the positive reviewers even read the book. (The queen is ""Andes"" and they live in the ""Silth""?)I just can't figure out why I keep reading these. But I do. I am definately going to get the next one from the library though, and I recommend that if you haven't already been suckered into buying this one, get this one from the library as well."
3,Another filler book,"LH can produce wonderfully violent works with action driven plots. But lately its just sex and more sex and some more sex in both of her series. Why can't we have sex and some plot development? Most people I know read LH for the plot not for the sex. And frankly the sex seems excessive. It's almost sex. . .100 pages. . .sex. . . 100 pages. At what point does the sex become obligatory? I know Merry's a sex diety, but really!As far as I'm concerned Stroke of Midnight and Mistral's Kiss should have been one book. One 'filler' or bridge book is ok, but two? Two is just ridiculous. So now I'm waiting for the Harliquin to come out and hoping that there's more plot development along with the sex."
2,What??,"Although I have loved other books by this author, I had to stop reading this one. A 212 page book, I had to stop reading on page 136, but i should have stopped sooner. Very boring and the sex was really bad, very ""unfulfilling"". I did not get the plot or anything else from this book, skip it. I gave it 2 stars because I do like the author and hope she does better."
3,"Love some, wish it was longer","I have been waiting for this book for ages it seems. I love the Merry storyline with Faerie, and agree with other postings that it was wayy too short. I felt like we were just getting warmed up and it ended. However, I do think they gave some vital information (more on restoring the kingdoms) and I enjoyed the Sholto stuff. I also want her to center back on Doyle and Frost. They keep having the same reactions to all of her sexcapades, come on,they used to be gods, not just men that she needs to help their self-esteem every time she sleeps with someone else. I hope the next Merry book will come out sooner than a year! I want some closure...."
4,Too short,The story does not conclude nicely in this one. Needs a few more chapters. But I know she writes that way on purpose to draw us to the next.
2,"At last, some plot!!!!","I wasn't too optimistic when I picked up this book. It seems like LKH has given up on plot and story and thinks her fans will fall overthemselves over her gleefully graphic, all encompassing, and mostly pointless sex scenes. There is a huge difference between a good book with sex scenes and a porno with some dialogue. LKH is not such a godlike figure that she can mask the difference by putting her name on a dustjacket.So anyway, low expectations. But this book <gasp> actually had plot. And fighting that was done outside the confines of the main character's brain! And even some story development! It was no where near the quality of her earlier Anita Blake books but it gives me hope that LKH has woken up, listened to the people who made her famous in the first place, and has attempted to go back to doing what she does best."
3,Great but incomplete and with error,"I'm a polyglot and enjoy learning foreign languages. This CD set is for those who want fine tuning in grammar but for those who learn with visual cues, this is not for driving but for home studying. I found a mistake in one of the CDS, also. It's also a little disappointing that very important conjugations such the conjunctive and imperative tenses are not mentioned (maybe in a separate edition?). Otherwise, a great tool. I gave it 3 stars for the reasons above all, otherwise, it would be a 5. This is not a review of the seller, just of the product."
4,Great resource,"This CD set was almost exactly what I was looking for. I got this because verbs are my biggest challenge in language. This was the only thing out there that I could find focusing on both vocabulary and specifically verbs. The only thing that would make this better is that I wish all the verbs were done as separate sound bites so that I could load them into my iPod and put them on shuffle. It is easy to remember all the conjucations in order. It is much harder to hear them separated (where you don't know which tense, which verb, etc. to expect). I am actually working on doing this myself. I do still recommend it, as it is unique in its scope, and you won't find anthing else close."
2,Pinzon Sheet Set,"Product is generally good, however the texture is not as soft as I would expect for a high thread count sheet. Also, rgardless of washer & dryer settings the sheets come out very wrinkled. Over-all I would give this product a grade of ""C."""
2,"looks nice, feels scratchy","I was excited based on the reviews to try these sheets, but as soon as I took them out of the package they were noticably scratchy. I washed and dried them once and then put them on the bed. Super scratchy. I felt like I was getting exfoliated! I sent them back."
5,Great!,"This product is just great, is not sticky and gives shine. I think the choice of styling cream/gels is very subjective, but I found this product superlative"
5,great viewing for train buffs.,The scenery was beautiful and I especially liked the extensive history of the towns and railroad stations. It was very informative for train buffs as it detailed the different types of locomotives and visited the local train museums. A worthwhile purchase for any library re:train travel.
2,Not a very good book to learn DELPHI,"USING DELPHI 3 is not a very good book to get you started learning DELPHI. It seems to just list features and functions without explaining (in a simplified format) how and why. The examples are also incomplete and a little criptic. Maybe others got some help from this book, but I found very little that I could use. Of the 12 books I have on DELPHI the best is MASTERING DELPHI 3 by Marco Cantu, followed by DELPHI UNLEASHED by Charles Calvert."
5,good read,"good info , worht a read if your looking at pallitive care as a career, good practical information. thank you"
3,Not Restaurant Quality,Product is OK but the pan is very lightweight. I was raised in the hospitality business and with heavy use I doubt the product will stand up..
2,"Not the pan I ordered, Twice",Ordered Nordic ware pro cast twice and was sent the restaurant type of pan. Had to order it from another source.
2,rann movie,"The movie and acting is good, but the volume kept changing on its own on this dvd which is very annoying.Rann- Amitabh Bachchan, Ben Kingsley (Hindi Film / Bollywood Movie / Indian Cinema DVD)"
3,Depends What You Use It For,"I use this LED for my license plate light, and it is decent for that, but wont be up to the task for interior lights or reverse lights."
1,no software,the polariod gps with dvd player has no software help the usb and sd slot are usless and polariod no longer support it.
2,DISAPPOINTING,"I just could not get into this book. No real character development. At the end of the book, I really didn't feel like I knew the characters any better than on the first page. I didn't care what happened to these people because I had no emotional investment at all. If you want to read an excellant scottish novel, try ""If You Dare"" by Kressly Cole. I finished that book just before I read this one, and it was wonderful. I didn't want it to end. Excellent character develpopment, and the secondary characters are great as well. A riveting read. I couldn't put it down!!!!"
3,Daring the Highlander,This is not my choice in reading material. It is the choice of a woman in prison that I write to. So far she has been happy with my selections. It allows her an escape from the terrible circumstances of her life.
5,Book one of the Legacy of MacLeod,A great book of ancient Scotland and the Clan MacLeod - a gripping tale of love and war - could not put this book down!
3,good light reading,"Part of a linked series of romance noves set in Scotland. Well done escape reading. Characters less than real, but that's the genre, right?"
5,Great series,This was a great beginning to the series. I enjoy series books a great deal and this one didnt let me down I enjoy anything with romance and the Highlands.
5,Held my interesr,"I read this book first, I thought it was the beginning of the series. I really enjoyed it, it held my interest and fired my imagination."
2,so-so easy to put down and pick up weeks later,"Easy to put down and pick up again weeks later. Not enough stuff about other things going on other than what the main characters do in bed, how boring!"
4,Scot Historical Novel,"The story was exciting, the characters well-drawn and interesting. I look forward to reading any subsequent books by this author about these characters."
5,Zorro lives!,"For clean, wholesome entertainment, this is it. Brought back alot of memories of childhood!"
5,Complete Zorro second season,Order came quickly. I have not yet reviewed the CD's due to it being a Christmas gift but product appears to be in perfect condition.
5,Highly recommended!!!,"I have finished watching the final episode of the second season. The story arcs are shorter, three or four episodes in the second season, but none the less entertaining. I must say have a sense of loss - trying to understand why there were only two seasons of this excellent show. I know there was some sort of squabble between Walt Disney and ABC as Walt was trying to move to NBC and color, but this was really an exceptional series and the viewer got the short end of it with the premature cancellation. A wit and a warmth to the characters, great production values, and all the swash and buckle that you could want with the sword fighting and daring do. Anyway, thanks to WD Treasury for bringing back some truly fun and exciting entertainment. I enjoyed it as a lad and just as much as a semi senior citizen. Highly recommended!!!"
1,What's happened!,"I have used these hoes since I was a child. I used them in my business for 28 years. I never had a bad one, what the he'll happened? The is the biggest piece of ---- I 've ever seen! Doesn't any one care any more? They use to be steel not cast and cleaned up! A person could be hurt by this mess? Do you want a photo! I am an American I fought for this country and I wish to be treated that way. I'm going to be 65 in three weeks, your hoe use to be light so a man could do a days work, my kids could handle one! I am not happy! Wish you were here so we could have a chat. Dale. Do you have an old one you would like to sell? Ui"
3,Farmer's Daughter,"Not exactly what I was looking for. It is well built, but it is far too wide to use for any length of time. Needless to say, I am disappointed with the hoe."
5,A must read for anyone in the churches of Christ,"First, the negatives- this books oddly falls off a cliff halfway in. The book is clicking along nicely concerning theology problems inside the church of Christ then, for no apparent reason, there are a few essays about the big bang and other seemingly non-related subjects. Then, as strangely as it began, the book returns to the subjects of tradition verses opinion verses truth in the churches of Christ.Don't let the weird warble turn you off to this book. It is an excellent collection of short articles about problems with the doctrine of the church of Christ. Wait! Members of the churches of Christ will tell you they have no doctrine except the Bible! Of course, that is where this book is excellent. It's not what the Bible says, but how it is interpreted and it takes a close look at what is actually tradition and Biblical teaching.This is a fine book and any one who is a member of the church of Christ needs to read it."
5,Must read for Church of Christ folks,"This is a challenging, enlightening book. It targets legalism, small thinking and the bondage associated with both. It offers answers to some hard questions, and raises even more. While not everyone will agree with everything in it (although I think I did), it is a stimilating and refreshing read. I wholeheartedly recommend it. You will be better for having read it."
4,Only for those within to understand,"The book deals with the progressive agenda within the churches of Christ during the turn of the century. The book highlights some concerns of the author over rigid patternism. The book is a call to unity. The major problem of the text is that the author infuses much opinion into the prose. The topics are relevant, but before one is to buy into his system, there must be more argumentation for his believes. There must be deeper investigation into these points of view. The author has drunk deeply of Leroy."
5,"A Must Have for ""Green"" Gardeners","For those of us who don't like having chemicals in and around our homes, much less our food, this book is a 'must have.' It helps with identification of what insect or disease is causing plant damage and then gives great advice about what organically combats plant diseases or how to get rid of the bad bugs without also killing the good bugs."
3,Helpful,I really wanted more natural recipes for pesticides. This has lots of info that I do not care about...
5,Good reference book,Very well done. The photos are incredibly helpful in identifying problems and whether their caused by disease or insects. Excellent solutions are offered.
3,Complex,"The book was very good from a technical standpoint but more than I wanted or needed. I was looking more for the home remedies to my garden problems. Things that I would normally have in the kitchen, such as soap, garlic, pepper, etc. It did have some of those remedies but there were many more technically more complex and commercially available fixes to my garden problems. I could have gotten this information from reading the backs of compound containers at the the garden supply store.A good and well researched book but not what I was looking because the title led me to believe it was solutions without chemicals and most of the solutions are what I consider to be chemical."
1,Not for anyone wanting to know about technique,"I ordered this book hoping several years ago hoping to learn enough technique to try encaustic...it was hopeless...I am familiar with other art mediums and have sinced learned the basics of the technique...That being said, I went back to the book to see if I could learn anything new now that I understood the techniques, and again, the technique is intentionally vague due to the artist obviously being more interested in herself than helping anyone learn. I emailed her with a simple questions and she responded that ""this book was about why...she nevers reveals anything about technique."" So...there are so many other good books out there that I would definitely pass on this one."
3,Encaustic Nowadays,"As I'm a painter and want to expand my set of materials I'm using, I bought it, it is a very good book to get into Encaustic"
5,Best book out there on encaustics,I add my wholehearted rec to those already posted. I have looked at all the how-to books out there and this is by far the best one.
2,Not worth the money.,"After reading that this was the best book ever for learning about encaustic painting I was eager to read the book. I was sorely disappointed. I've read the same information on Google. The examples were old, nothing I would want to try. I realize the book was written many years ago but it was boring. I'm sorry I spent the money on it."
5,The Art of Encaustic Painting,"This is an amazing book for anyone interested in encaustic painting. It covers the history of encaustics all the way to the present day artists using the medium. This should be considered the bible for anyone interested in using encaustics in their art. The author shows in detail the uses of encaustic medium how it is made or where to buy, tools for use etc. I recommend this book to all that are interested in trying encaustic painting to buy and read Joanne Mattera' book The Art of Encaustic Painting."
5,Fantastic book for encaustic artists,I bought this book when I started painting with encaustic. It is FABULOUS. I look forward to her next book.
3,Over rated,"There was such great hype about this book from both my instructors as well as fellow artists, that I was expecting extraordinary information. I admit it's a good book. It covers history, proper use of materials and it's limitations. What it doesn't do is inspire to explore/challenge the medium. If you are motivated to follow the status quo, then this is a great book. I feel this book emphasizes the traditional parameters of what encuastic is all about, however, it doesn't give enough exposure to current artists bending the traditional parameters of the medium . I would classify this book as a solid textbook. I look forward to future material from the author where contemporary artists are featured and material is presented in context of historical reference and limitations."
2,A Polemical Book?,"This book is polemical. The language, the words, the selection of evidence, even the title all point to the agenda that the author has. If only it really were as simple as Earl wants us to believe. His tone was a little too agressive, a bit too keen to convince for my liking - a little humility would have gone a long way, a more measured and reasonable tone would have been good. Fundamentally this is not a work of scholarship - it is a work that uses scholarship for its own end. Freethinkers beware!"
3,Questions,"I am not necessarily saying that the book is good or bad, however it seems to be mostly theories and opinions of the author, therefore I have some questions for Mr. Doherty:What happens if you're wrong?Will you even admit the possiblity that you could be wrong?"
1,Hilarious....,"...Only, it wasn't meant to be. I'm puzzled why someone would spend so much time and energy to refute something as irrefutable as the historical Jesus--and then do such an incredibly bad job of it! Mark invented Christ? Why? If that's true, while he spread the tale, what were all the people he was writing about, who were well known and still alive, saying about it? ""Um, Mark, who in the world is this Jesus guy that I supposedly purchased a tomb for?"" ""Yeah, say, Mark, I hate to be a jerk about this, but I never rowed my boat out further in the water because some guy named Jesus told me to.""Ridiculous. Absolutely ridiculous. Makes the raving asserstions of the nuts in the Jesus Seminar seem incredibly rational."
3,Good Vibes,"This CD is short and to the point at only ten songs long. But overall I'd say it's worth the cheaper price. This is all you really need if you're just a casual Roy Ayers fan or want a good overview of his best stuff for a good price.The CD has lots of funky, jazzy, R&B; from the 70s. This is defining music for that time period in terms of where jazz had headed by then. Jazz had ""souled"" out - or sold out depending on how you look at it.Also Roy's music has been sampled to death by hip-hop acts, most notably by A Tribe Called Quest.Overall, it's good grooving stuff most of the time, with a hint of 70's cheesiness thrown in every once in a while. A good cd for what it is."
3,Not the best reproduction...,"First, the doll is great. I'm not fond of the stiff bangs, but the face was done quite nicely. The squared shoulders are also not very attractive, but maybe that is how the original was made.The bad thing about this doll is the clothing. I model dolls a lot and take pictures to display at various locations. The outfit on this doll is bulky and ungiving - it was hard to get a cute close up picture with or without the jacket. The other repro's like the Made for You and the Smasheroo were much better made."
1,barbie collector,"Not a collector item. Very plain barbie, looks cheap.I got a silkstone for the same price and was dissponited to see this barbie - i am returning it."
5,Hooray For Danny Kaye!,"Any film that stars Danny Kaye is automatically worth 5 stars as far as I am concerned. I first saw him in a movie while just a kid back in the '40s & became enthralled with his comedic talent, Later I actually met him at a public swimming pool in Beverly Hills."
3,"Slapstick, But It Has It's Moments","Rather silly premise of just 2 American soldiers posted to a British unit. (The British soldiers were clearly American.) Danny Kaye's character was over-the -top. Still, there were some funny moments, like the impossibly quick costume changes as Kaye's character tried to escape from the German soldiers, none of whom seemed able to catch or shoot him. This type of slapstick comedy would have looked better in the 1920s."
2,"Wow, the version I saw must have had all the funny bits chopped out","Not the least funny comedy I've ever seen, but close. A mostly great supporting cast, other than the awful Miss Diana Dors, but including the lovely Dana Wynter who looks just like Betty Crocker, cannot save this underwritten turkey. I cannot imagine how anyone could find that interminable cabaret scene funny. It made me cringe to watch.No need to go on; this was silly, totally predictable, with all the content of a film made in a weekend by high school kids."
2,Surprise!!,"These are just shelves, so I can't get too excited or upset. I received them a couple of days ago and installed them in my garage. Not to difficult . . . find a stud, drill a hole and attach bracket. No problem so far. I came home tonight and one side of one of the shelves had come unattached from the wall. I couldn't believe my eyes, that is, until I realized that the bolt head had snapped off (the bolts ""bodies"" were still securely in the stud). I guess I had over tightened (by hand) or perhaps the hardware was just too cheap? I have to move the entire shelf now which isn't the end of the world, but now I'm waiting on the other shelf to fail. btw - for those wondering, I only had about 30 lbs of stuff on the shelf when it fell (well within the documented limits).My recommendation . . . if you buy these shelves go invest in some $2-3 hardware from the local hardware store, or you might get a similar surprise."
5,WELL I LIKE HER.,"WELL YOU CAN TELL SHE'S A MODEL RIGHT OFF BECUASE SHE IS SUPER, SUPER-SKINNY AND SHE'S WEARING NEXT TO NOTHING. ALSO SHE HAS ONE OF THOSE STRANGE-LOOKING FACIAL EXPRESSIONS. (KIND OF A STUCK-UP LOOK IF YOU ASK ME!) BUT FOR SOME REASON I LIKE HER. I THINK I MIGHT EVEN BUY HER. AFTER ALL SHE IS A COLLECTIBLE. AND FOR ONCE THE PRICE HERE IS ACTUALLY REASONABLE! 5 STARS OVERALL. THIS DOLL IS NOT TOO BAD. AND THE PRICE IS EXCELLENT!!!!"
4,A young boy becomes a superhero in this unusual book.,"One day, while enroute to deliver his newspapers, Henry has a strange encounter with a little sparrow. Like his favorite comic strip hero, Falconman, Henry is given the power to fly. As he delivers his papers from the air, he rescues neighborhood children from a bully and his mean dog and saves the sparrow who can no longer fly. When Henry realizes he has the power to restore the sparrow's flight, he returns to the spot where the encounter took place. The comic book format and spare text will be very attractive to young readers and older ""reluctant"" readers as well. Pinkney's signature scratchboard illustrations are bright and provide an unusual background for this contemporary superhero. The hopeful ending leaves the possiblility of a sequel open."
2,Waste of Time,"I read this book first because it was the only one the library had at the time. I was able to follow the plot. However, it took a long time for me to really get hooked and even after that I kept thinking about how awful the writing was. The plot should have been better developed and there are so many more authors that are more worth reading."
3,Because it's not that worth it,"I LOVE the gossip girls series. I bought the 2nd book first and loved it. So I went back, bought the 3rd one, and then the 1st one. Then when *Because I'm Worth It* came out, I got all excited and got it immediately. BUT, I must say, it's the worse one out of all the four books. It's much much less eventful, and some pages were so boring I had to skip them altogether. Hopefully the 5th book will be better..."
3,Because I'm worth it,My 14 year old Daughter read this book rather quickly. She said it was interesting but predicatible and the ending was weird.
2,Not happy,"I guess I'm number two to review this.Being an avid reader of this series, I waited and WAITED for this book to come out. I wanted to see if Blair got into Yale, the aftereffects that Nate's ""infidelity"" had on Jenny, and whether or not Serena could stay with Aaron for longer than two seconds.All but one of my questions were answered: Did Blair get in or not? Who knows?At this point, who cares? I was ready to put Blair through a wall. I find the character totally unbelievable, bitchy, and egocentric. While some may find her enjoyable, I wanted to vomit over her overflowing self-absorption.Also: If possible, all the characters are totally unlikable now. Even Dan, who was a bit neurotic, is now a rock-star poet wannabe who got rid of Vanessa because he became semi-famous. How annoying. At least Serena stayed the same.I'm not so sure if I want to read the 5th book (if there is one)Overall: Not impressed."
4,Good but more to come...,I am a die hard fan of these books. Of course i had this rushed to my house so i could read it. Like always i sat down and read the book cover to cover in one sitting. The book did give new twists and finished up some of the old twists but some how i didn't enjoy it as much. But thats ok since i read in the New York Times when they did an article on the gossip girl series that there are 5 more books coming! Yes 5 i could hardly contain myself since i thought this was the last one. Hopefully the next book will fulfill me.
2,Ugh...Didn't like this one at all.,"I love all the gossip girl books, and when I bought this I was expecting it to be just as good as all the others...unfortunately it's not. It made feel sick because what happened with Jenny and her friend. Sure, it's not that big of a deal but come on! UGH. And overall this book was NOT as interesting as the others ones. Hopefully the 5th will be good."
5,Awesome book,"I read the whole series in a less than 6 days! Thats not weird for me because i love books, but everyone in my grade loves them! including myself! they are just fun books for girls to read. They are funny and you keep wanting to know more. Always very suspenseful. If you liked the Angus Thongs and Full Frontal snoggle books, you'll LOVE these. But remember, dont try to be Gossip Girl in real life, it could do some serious damage to your socail life."
4,This book is Worth it,"I love the Gossip Girl series and can't ait for the fifth to come out, i can agree with some of the other reveiwers when they say its not that realistic sometimes but other than that i love this book. I kinda thought that the whole Mystery and Dan thing was kinda stupid, i mean, who gets turned on by yellow nails and yellow front teeth? But whatever, the end of the book was mostly about sexual stuff, Nate and Georgie in the closet, Dan and Mystery, Jennifer and Elise, but eah i thought the Blair and Owen thing was kinda cool, I totally recomend this book to whoever is mature enough to not take some things too seriously, I can't wait until what happens at Gossip Girls party, i have a feeling is going to be craazy!"
3,"Definitely ""Worth It""","BECAUSE I'M WORTH IT is the fourth book in the Gossip Girl series. The catfights, breakups and shakeups continue.This book is appropriately titled, not only because of the pop culture reference, but because we see a bit more of the characters one-on-one, without their significant others. For example, Nate attends rehab and manages to go from addict to hero. This is not the same Nate we met in book one. Blair is as love-hungry as ever, falling for an older man, while her best friend Serena dazzles every boy and man in her path. Artsy outsiders Vanessa and Dan continue their pursuits in film and poetry, respectfully, while pining for each other.As with the previous books in the series, BECAUSE I'M WORTH IT teeters between being coy to being outright racy. High school students and adults alike continue to rave about this series."
2,it's not worth it,"I really enjoyed the other books in this series, but by the end of this one, I hated all of the charaters. You can't really relate to any of them because they are all insane! Reading about Dan in this book made me want vomit"
4,"This series is SOO good, but the 4th was not the best!","I LOVE this series. I am a slow reader, and I always read these books in most two days...They are sooo good.I live in Philadelphia in ""Rhittenhouse Square"" and this is exactly what my life is like with my friends. I love when they talk about NY, b/c I have an appt. on 68th and 5th. These books are soooo good, but unfortuneately the fourth was not the best...I thought it didn't put the charcters in a good light. Don't get me wrong, I still read it in like a day! Even though, I didn't think this book was the best, I still can NOT wait for the 5th to come out...P.S--Who is gossip girl??!!!....I sooo can't wait to find out!...I read A-list, and it was pretty good, but not as good as the gossip girl series. If you like these kind of books, read ""the nanny diaries"", ""normal girl""-by molly long-fast!"
4,great case,"Some problems with this case:1. The slot for the DVD drive will have a gap around it. And tricky to install.2. The hard drive IDE cable can get tangled in putting the drive frame.Overall, it is a small and great case. It is best to use a SATA hard drive with this case (less cable mess)."
5,Captivating and Classic!,"This toy house is sure to become an heirloom in our family. Although it's listed for 3 year-olds, my 2 year-old daughter took to it immediately. I don't think she really understand the rooms particularly but it's fun for her to pretend with the ""Momma"" and ""Daddy"" dolls. This house could be very much fun to paint and decorate.My only complaint is that the labels are glued to the roof eaves and very hard to remove....why wouldn't the manufacturers use that tacky glue that comes off so easily?"
5,"Great dollhouse, even for boys","My son received this for his second birthday and has played with it every day since. The labels were not a problem to remove. The people and furniture are definitely durable enough for toddlers. As someone else mentioned, I also wish that there were more figures and furniture available for the house, although they are the same scale as the old-style Fisher Price people, furniture, and cars, plus many other toy cars fit in the garage. (It's funny to see the Fisher Price dog taking a bath or watching TV!) As my kids grow older, we will probably decorate the house with rugs, wallpaper, etc."
3,dissapointed,"While this doll house is really a wonderful toy, there are some aspects of it that greatly dissappointed me.The furniture that comes with it is made extremely poorly. When we received this house and opened it up: table was broken, chairs were separated from their legs (unglued), bed stands were broken. I am really dissapointed as I expected better quality from Melissa & Doug product. Even if this was a shipping damage (which it honestly does not seem to be), how is this product supposed to endure any child playing with it? It just looks like the wood and glue used are very low quality.Seeing that most people are happy with this product, may be we were just unlucky and received a bad house."
3,Just 'Okay',"My daughter plays with the dollhouse, but not as I expected. She ENJOYS playing with dollhouses... She walks into daycare and that is what she enjoys doing most! She asks to play with the dollhouse, but, at home, the dollhouse is almost ignored most times. Maybe it is the lack of color... I cannot say, to be truthful. I just know that daycare has several dollhouses and they are VERY colorful... people and furniture, which this one has furniture and a couple of people, also, but she just doesn't do much with it. She is 3 yrs of age."
4,"Great for a boy tooboy doll house, !","My 3 year old son had been asking for a man doll house (this is what we call it so it wouldn't be to girlie)so I searched for a dollhouse that was not pink or lavendar etc. I finally came across this one so I ordered it. He was so excited Christmas morning that Santa had brought this for him. He plays with it all the time it's now a house for his toy soldiers. You can even paint it if you like. I like all the furniture that comes with it the only problem is they don't stick to anything so once the house is closed and moved around the furniture falls all over the place. However, that's minor to deal with and well worth the money to see him happy.."
5,Good for Girls AND Boys!,"I got this dollhouse for my 3 year old daughter, but her brother's who are 4 and 1, ( and me 32 :) like to play with it even more than her. It is a great dollhouse with neutral colors so it's cool for both genders (my husband even thinks so too). It's very sturdy also."
5,One of a kind--a pioneer book. Beatifully written and informative.,This beautiful book helps in understanding the origin of Turkish Society and it is not only for children but also adults who realy want to know who are Turkish people.
1,Pieca Crap!!!,UGH!!! At first it seemed all nice and dandy..but RIGHT AFTER the warranty ended so did the dandiness... it still wont work...i dont even fell like explainin...
4,still good,"im listening to it now in november and i bought it the day it came out. i think it's some of patton's most focused work ever, even though the other member's apparently contributed as much input if not more than patton."
2,Glad they made it but I don't like it,"I understand why the guys in Tomahawk wanted to make this album. And I like what the other reviewer said about it being an album that actually benefits from the title of the band. However, I personally don't dig it that much and like many others of you I have every Fantomas, Bungle, Peepingtom, etc.... out there (not all of which are good).Unlike the other 2 Tomahawks, you really can't imagine the band touring with this one, and I don't think they have yet. Its just not accessable. You can't really ride around and listen to it in your car, and with the exception of one or two songs, you reall can't' sing along.I know there is always the exception. I'm sure someone is frowning when they read this saying they'd love to go see this live and like singing along, but I'm betting that's the minorty."
3,Not sure...,"Too electric which I thought took away from the soul of the songs. I thought the compositions of the songs were awesome, but they did have more of a Fantomas feel them. On top of that I wish Mike would have incorporated some authentic Native American instruments in a few of the songs. A few of these songs unplugged would have been a nice twist and a bit of a solute. Overall it was not a typical ""surprise around every corner and make me queasy"" cut that you would normally expect from this crew of talent."
2,FU##ING PATTON,"WHAT THE FU## WERE YOU THINKING MIKE,THIS IS WHAT I SAID TO MYSELF WHEN I PUT THIS ON.I`M A HUGE PATTON FAN,SO I KNOW PATTON RELEASES SOME STUFF THAT IS WAY GONE,BUT THIS WAS A TOMAHAWK CD,TOMAHAWK,ONE OF HIS MORE NORMAL PROJECTS,NOT ANYMORE!THIS IS TRIBAL JUNGLE BUNGLEOMAS.I DON`T MIND CAUSE I`M A FAN,BUT IF THIS IS YOUR FIRST TOMAHAWK CD,STOP,GET MIT GAS OR THEIR DEBUT CD,THEY ARE GREAT DISCS.!"
5,"a bold move by patton,but one at least a few can enjoy","I have a bit of Native American blood in me,so I feel like this Tomahawk album hit home a bit more than most albums tend to. the Native American theme could become repetitive with the chanting and drums;to those used to the more rock-oriented patton projects it could get frustrating,but I absolutely love it! it's just too bad that this kind of traditional music doesn't inspire others to draw energy for their work from it;maybe that's why Patton named it ""Anonymous""--because this style of music(as well as the culture)are relatively unknown and outcasts of society."
1,"Total time of this dvd is 0""zero""","not only that but it is blank,at least according to the ""detailed info"""
2,OK reading. Little new.,"Jerome Charyn is a good writer and also a table tennis lover. He writes about the sport with many colorful analogies and clever expressions, sometimes using French without translating it. For me, it got a bit tiring, but it could be enjoyable if you like his creative writing style.Much of the book is rehashing of the stuff in Marty Reisman's ""The Money Player"" and Tim Boggan's books. But Jerome also interviewed many people for the book and adds new perspectives to some well known figures in the sport from these interviews.I noticed an occasional mistake in the book, but not many. It is mostly well researched."
3,Reads as if it had two authors,"The author who began this book has an incisive wit and extensive medical knowledge. My imediately thought was that I wanted to read more by this author. The author who finished the book has watched too much T.V., worse he couldn't stop adding endings and epilogues. If you can stop after the first paragraph on Page 286, you'll probably enjoy it."

2,I think I received a used item,The box the music box was in was very worn and had clearly been opened and closed many times. One of the edges of the music box itself was also worn. It looks like someone used it every year at Christmas then resold it. It was advertised as new.
3,Good overall,"It's a little confusing to used at first, but once you get the hang of it, it really works pretty well. I find myself going back to the manual to use the more advanced features however. Some of the keys are non-intuitive (there's no space bar, for example; you just leave it out). The screen is difficult to read in all but the brightest light unless you turn on the backlight. All in all, I'm pretty impressed with, especially for what I paid."
5,Excelente para estudiantes,"estoy estudiando ingles en Sydney y me ha ayudado mucho a entender las palabras con ejemplos y todos los usos. Tambien tiene una opcion de Geografia, donde puedes ver informacion de los paises y ciudades de tus companheros de todas partes del mundo.Recomendado 100%. Muy conveniente por el precio.Rodrigo.-"
2,Somewhat large,"I bought it because the price after rebate was pretty low. I guess that you get what you pay for.However, this is somewhat larger than needed. It probably could be done in 2/3 to 1/2 the dimensions. It does not fit in a shirt pocket or front pocket. It does fit into a hip pocket; but I am not sure that is a good thing to do.It has a lot of functions that are not needed if you are looking for a Spanish/English translator, as I was."
5,This is a quick and convenient look-up tool,It's worth every penny of the after rebate price!It is very straightforward to use and the keyboard is large enough to ensure that you only hit one key most of the time. I like dictionaries and own several in book form. Oxford has long been my favorite. This portable little gadget makes a nice addition to my arsenal and is great for quick look-ups.I've been playing with the Geographic Dictionary and it contains more information than I expected.
5,Sharp PW-E250 pocket dictionary,My daughter is crazy about this gadget! Thanks to all the Spanish teachers who recommended it!
2,Very confusing,Insert a word and it comes up with many selections to choose from. If you don't know the word... how can you select one?
4,"Nice, sturdy, but no conjugations","I have had pretty good luck with this translator... the thesaurus and spell-check and -fill options are quite nice, as are the entries for individual words; any given word will have at least two entries for definitions and possible English-Spanish translations. However, this does not have conjugations, which seems like a rather trivial thing to implement, given the complexity of the rest of the translators' software. I suppose this will force me to remember all these conjugation tables."
4,Good Information,Legends is a fine reference that is packed with information about guitarists from every area of rock. The book will be especially helpful to those looking for information on the major guitar players and also for those looking to find unknown guitarists that are worth a listen.
5,The best inside look at the game between the lines.,"Baseball is often called a thinking man's game, and Okrent's book testifies to the truth of that statement. Dissecting a game inning-by-inning, Okrent explores the hundreds of options, possibilities and actions that accompany each pitch and each signal. Read it, and you'll never watch a baseball game in the same way again"
3,Great Idea; Mixed Results,"It is a great concept for a book, and many aspects are fascinating, but it is sometimes challenging to plow through Okrent's writing style. He is a very bright man but I wish the writing was more conversational. Overall a good book. I've read 10 better baseball books but have also read 10 worse baseball books."
2,Tedious,"I read this book when it was new and I was beginning to follow baseball, and recently re-read it. Both times I found the book tedious and overblown.The concept of the book is a nice idea, but the actual segues and jumping-off points always seemed ham-fisted to me.The ideas are all there, but the execution is poor. Many, more recent, books have done a much more successful decontruction of the elements of a baseball game."
3,dated,I just read this book recently (2011). It has some interesting tidbits of information about baseball and a few recognizable player names come up. But really the book is of almost no value today. way too old and dated.
2,Too verbose and too one-sided,"I had heard about this book so I was interested in getting it. When I saw it at a bookstore I quickly snatched it up. Once I started reading, I became annoyed as seemingly every sixth word had me scrambling for the dictionary. Don't get me wrong I have a good vocabulary, but when was the last time you used the word ""hemidemisemiquaver""? That's what I thought.Along with trying way too hard to sound smart, Okrent spends far too much time talking about the Brewers. Hey Dan, two teams played this game not one. By the end of the book I knew almost everything there was to know about the Brewers' players, but little about the Orioles' players. Had Okrent spent more time discussing the O's players too, I would have found this book more enjoyable. I wouldn't bother with this one unless you are a Brewers fan."
4,Utterly Fascinating,"As a young boy, I read Okrent's Ultimate Baseball book. As a much older man, I watched Okrent on Ken Burns' Baseball and enjoyed his witty thoughts. Finally, I came to 9 Innings. It is a terrific read. What a great idea to look at the world of baseball through the lens of one game. It was a fascinating look at the game and the Brewers in the their brief glory days. Everything from the grounds crew to the ownership books was noted. The game, between the AL Champion '82 Brewers and the soon to be World Champion '83 Orioles, was entertaining. But, the picture of life in a small market and behind the scenes stuff is the best. The updates at the end strangely gloss over a Brewers team that came within one win of the World Championship and ignore the Orioles championships (and Hall of Famers Murray and Ripken) entirely. That is ok. A brillant book by a real traditionalist. Not dated if you are a true fan."
3,A Filmmakers Dream Project,"In 1885, the Lumiere Brothers perfected a hand-cranked movie camera that moved the world. This 100th year anniversary takes forty filmmakers to task with the same camera to produce a film less than a minute. It's not as interesting in its results as one might have hoped. It was a huge challenge and few really completed something of interest. Of those, David Lynch, Patrice Leconte and Alaine Corneau are the most intriguing, while well known directors like Spike Lee and Liv Ullmann are less so. However, this is subjective. Many of the directors are asked simple questions with the hopes of profound answers. ""Why do you film"" and ""Is cinema immortal"" get answers as mundane as `climbing a mountain because it is there'. Film students will, however, be fascinated with this project and historians will marvel that an invention so old can still be of artistic use. For the average viewer, this 88 minute documentary might seem boring, but at the very least, it is historic."
3,Lumiere and Company,"Possibly the greatest disappointment in cinema history, 39 of the 'greatest' directors display a dazzling lack of imagination as they waste the great opportunity to make a unique film. Lynch's film makes the tape worth buying, and is amazing & inventive. buy the tape, and wind through to this film only."
4,one of the few great comics ever,"I absolutely love those plots. It's filled with real intelligence and a lot useful tricks, unlike most other comics. And full of surprises, you never can guess what happens in the next moment. I'm a fan of Modesty Blaise since I was a kid. A must for her fans. I felt the pictures could have been drawn a little better."
3,Elvis Favorites ~Merle Haggard & Conway Twitty-Review,"The songs were all familiar to any Elvis fan, however Merle Haggard should stick to classic country. He just can't quite bring you that happy, jumpy feeling of early rock and roll. I was also a bit dissappointed that neither Merle or Conway sang anything that Elvis did in his later years. The man died in '77 NOT '57. Conway Twitty was as close to equal with Elvis any performer ever came. His Rendition of some of the King's early hits seemed as tho Elvis himself had possessed his body and vocal chords. Part of that similarity between Conway Twitty and Elvis Presley was that they were both born in Mississippi, and both started out at the legendary Sun studios in Memphis. While I wasnt too thrilled with the whole CD, it's definatly worth it for Conway Twitty's contribution."
4,All as expected.,"All interface components (posts, switch, dial) seem sturdy and relatively easy to manipulate. The dial is a little hard to grip because it's a little flat, but it's easy to turn and sticks nicely in place at each position.The power posts are a little crowded. It's actually a little inconvenient to get a wire on them as it is. It would be even worse to get some crimped terminals onto them. They would very likely obstruct (or even trigger) the power switch or the voltage selector dial.Voltages seem fine. Some settings are measuring 0.3 to 0.5 volts high on my cheap $3 meter (take that for what it is). This has been fine for me because most circuits I power with it would drop it that much anyway. I have not yet tested this unit under heavy load.I wish there was a 5V setting. I might look into adding one.I don't have an oscilloscope and can't say how clean the power really is."
5,"Great CF Card, but the CABLE is WORTH IT!","We have this exact Lexar card and just love it. The best thing is the Jumpshoot cable which hooks to any computer with a USB port (hot-swappable). Instead of hooking your camera up to your computer, you can simply take the card out of your camera and insert it in the Jumpshot Cable's slot. Then, the CF card shows up on you computer as if it were a hard drive. You simply copy them to you own hard drive. In the meantime your camera can be in use or simply saving power. (Note: The Jumpshot Cable does come with some software so it will work on your computer-PC or Mac.)In addition, Lexar is know among pro photographers as one of the better quality manufacturer's. Great Quality and a Great Product."
5,A welcome DVD release,"Yes, I have not yet rewatched all the episodes. In fact, I plan to take my time, to savor each one. (But, rest assured, should some production problem arise, I will modify this review and lower the stars.) And, in this season, Don Diego's father does not know and the annoying Eagle is eventually introduced. Here are the first thirty-nine episodes + bonus one hour episodes in their original clearly focussed glorious black and white splendor. This is great fun, a six DVD set in a nifty tin presentation box with a bonus crossed swords pin(?)for costume parties, I guess. It is easy to skip over the introduction and go straight to the show. A great selection for those of us who remember the first presentation and, hopefully, a good choice for the younger set."
4,Limited Edition??,"Would like to know from the informed or Disney themselves, if this is going to be a limited release? As with their ""Scarecrow"" release it was gobbled up by sellers on this site and others, where now you have to pay thru the nose for a copy of ""Scarecrow."" Same has happened to ""Secret Agent Man"" and the ""Prisoner"" sets.Dr. Syn: The Scarecrow of Romney Marsh (Walt Disney Treasures)Secret Agent (aka Danger Man) - The Complete Collection Megaset 2007The Prisoner - Complete Series Megaset (40th Anniversary Edition)All these sets are overpriced, especially in todays hard financial economy. If any one knows please a provide your response as I would like to pay a fair price for these items without having to pre-order before the item comes out. I like to read the reviews after the items come out to see if my hard earned dollars should be spent. Nuff said!"
5,zorro walt disney season 1,"this is a great addition to my zorro collection, it's wroth the money to get it and don't forget season 2. this is done in english language."
2,disappointing presentation,I have been a Guy Williams / Zorro fan since I remember its debut when I was 7. Great stuff - but not here. The picture quality - for having the original negative - is grainy and fuzzy enough to have been taped off TV. Nothing sharp and clear to be found.Leonard Maltin is hardly a ball of fire and has as much screen presence as a sponge. What Disney sees is him is beyond me.Very poor but they're probably too busy counting their profits to care.
1,It isn't released yet...,"If this product isn't released yet, and won't be available till November 2009, how can it already have 3 excellent reviews? Does Amazon have psychic buyers?Age of Propaganda: The Everyday Use and Abuse of Persuasion"
5,Thank You Walt Disney,"I have just finished watching both sets of this classic series and I can't say enough how thrilled I am to finally have all the episodes in their original black and white format.For me, this is a vast improvement over the colorized version first made available in France and then through the Disney Movie Club. I was always irritated by the color bleeding into areas it shouldn't have, especially in the trees. These transfers are amazing. I am hoping that these sell out so that once again Disney gets a clear message that thee is still really a market for this material and I'm am desperately hoping to see a Treasures set of the Peoples and Places series!!!"
2,I Want This but it's an Outrageous Price!,What a disgusting price ($205 on 7 July 2012) to pay for just one season of Zorro (even though it is a Disney treasure) - I recently purchased Season 2 at about half the price they are asking for Season 1 here on Amazon and hence there is absolutely no possibility that I will buy Season 1 until/if the price goes very much lower!I have started watching Season 2 and love it - the restored/remastered quality is very good and I suspect the same will apply to Season 1 - but due to the outrageous price for Season 1 there is no way I can give it more than 2 stars at this time!
1,"WHAT????????? Zero stars, for availability","Holy Mackrel there, Zorro! This was released on 3 Nov 09, and within three months is out of print??? No wonder bootleg DVD's of shows like this are proliferating. I can understand outfits like Disney wanting to make limited releases of DVD's to either make them exclusive, or create an aura of urgency to make a quick return on investment through rush purchases, but isn't three months just a bit short? I can't wait until the Third Season is released...for two weeks only. Zero stars, 'cause I never got to see the darned thing. (And, NO, I'm not paying the inflated prices of third party gougers.)"
4,"mostly fun, with caveats","Zorro 1st Season is appealing to a broad range of ages, i.e., lots of fun for families. Caution parents: while Zorro himself never kills anyone, there are lots of deaths, some grisly, that are inappropriate viewing for small children."
5,A Blast from the past,"I remeber watching this when I would get home from school. It is the first Zorro that I remember watching, and I have been Zorro fan ever since. So I am glad to have the opportunity to watch it again. It is a good quality. It has 5 disks and 8 episodes per disk. It would be a nice addition to any Zorro fan's collection"
4,"GREAT series, but.....$165.00?????","This isn't a review, it is only an observation. That's why only four stars instead of five.I too loved and remembered this series when I was a little kid. It, along with Davy Crockett were phenomenons of their time. I agree with all the reviews as to it's quality. Everything Uncle Walt oversaw was darn good to great.But... the price is really out of line. I mean, $164.95 for a six disc set???? I ask you, is this not highway robbery? I would expect this from Sgt. Garcia and his men, and especially from the alcalde, but certainly not from Disney! Where's Zorro when you really need him?a nostalgic viewer who will wait."
4,Simple enough for anyone to use,"This is a wonderful book for anyone who wants to learn to braid hair in a wide variety of styles. It includes information on the basics of working with long hair as well as 20 different braids.Though geared toward those in the hairstyling industry, it is simple enough for anyone to use. My husband who has never done any hairstyling was even able to do the simpler ones in just a few trys.The braids are arranged in order from easier to hardest. Written directions along with step-by-step illustrations showing hand positions are included. Each braid section is also shown in different shaded patterns.Some braid & ponytail styles include fishtail, rope, Dutch, knotting, twisting, bowtie, overlap updo and many French styles."
3,"""Made Easy""? wellll...","I purchased this book with high hopes for finding new styles that would be easy to do. It now sits on my dusty bookshelf, where it has been abandoned. The hairstyles are certainly lovely, but the effort involved for one person to do their own hair seems excessive. It's probably a great book if you are a stylist, but for the ""do-it-yourselfer"", it's daunting and disappointing. I'm searching for another title - one that will better suit my needs."
1,Overpriced,I think that this book is way overpriced for what it is. I returned it. It was more braids than updos and barely any colored pictures.
2,Very Basic Styles - Not Enough Formal Styles,"I expected more formal braid and updo styles, especially for the price."
4,Good quality and lots of fun,My 4 year old daughter asked for a stable for Christmas. She absolutely loves this toy and plays with it frequently with her barbies and horses. Very nice quality and will last for years.
4,The Folding Horse Stable,The folding horse stable is very cozy for your model horses and it is very easy to carry in each stall it can fit two horses on is a small stall the other is as big as a Foaling Barn stall(Foaling barn is a stall where female horses have there babies). The only problem is that the wooden stall doors get rusty and are hard to open sometimes and you have to use all your force to open.
5,"Very, very nice.",Ordered this Stable for my granddaughter for Christmas and was very impressed. The quality is very good and the price was great!
4,Excellent prooduct,"We purchased this barn for our daughter after we had looked at several other barns, and she was thrilled when she opended it Christmas morning. The quality is excellent and all of the parts described work very well."
4,Melissa & Doug Folding Horse Stable,It is well built and my granddaughter loves it. She loves horses so this is a great way for her to learn about the stables and barns. I would recommend it for families with children that love horses.
4,three concerns otherwise great barn,"My 8 year old horse crazy daughter got this barn from Santa for Christmas. Unfortunately, it arrived from the ""North Pole"" in a huge box on my front porch clearly labelled in large letters on all sides as to the contents and she is a good reader. Also the glue from the labels is impossible to remove and the barn has a habit of flying open when you try to carry it spilling horses and gates out everywhere because there is no latch to keep it folded. Despite these concerns, my daughter LOVES it and I've barely seen her since Christmas because she's had her head stuck in the barn caring for all her horses in her own happy little world."
5,Cooleo!,"THis si so cool! Although I did not get it from amazon, I got it from Santa, but still! Its so cool! It has a bunch of doors, some that slide,and fit breyer perfecttly! That's what I use mine for! It comes with a nic fence that works for breyer!"
5,Heirloom-quality stable,"Bought this for Christmas for my pre-teen, horse-crazed daughter.It's generously sized and when unfolded, creates enough room for both my girls (the other is 5) to play comfortably together. Well-made of solid wood. All the operational doors and hole from the loft make this versatile and fun. It's endured frequent play, being sat upon, sisterly squabbles and even our toddler's less-than-gentle investigations. Folded up, it holds A LOT, nice and neat. We have several Breyer Classic-sized horses in it, a couple dolls, all their accessories, the fence, and stable-cleaning tools, with plenty of room to spare. Breyer Traditional horses are probably more to scale, given window height, but it'll hold fewer of those than we can fit of the Classics.The price is half that of comparable models - and those models don't have the fold-up storage option, which I LOVE. This is one toy that will be saved for grandkids someday."
4,Really a nice barn.,"I bought this for my eight year old daughter, and she seems to love it! The detail and craftmanship is great, and I love that all the doors work smoothly! It is made pretty sturdy, but a playmate has broken the wooden hinge on one of the lower doors, and there's no way for me to fix it so that it will also function. I would also warn that if you are thinking of buying it to paint, there is a coating over the wood that does not take paint too readily! She has fun and it fits her Breyer horses well."
5,Senior Citizen,"This CD is terrific. This is my first David Benoit and I play it constantly and never tire of it. No one piece is superior over the others, they are all super. Wow! Easy listening."
5,GRRRRRREAT!!!,"Musicians~David Benoit, keyboards, sequencing, strings, programming; Rick Braun, trumpet, programming; Pat Kelly, Tony Maiden, Ross Bolton, guitars; Cliff Hugo, Jim johnson, Neil Stubenhaus, bass; Dave Palmer, Vinnie Colaiuta, drums; Brad Dutz, percussion; John Ferraro, drums, cymbals, percussion; Andy Suzuki, sax; Marc Antoine, guest guitarist; string orchestra conducted by David Benoit Enjoy!!"
4,Another musical success by David Benoit,"I enjoy Benoit's jazz a lot. Tracks like ""Something you said"" or ""Dad's Room"" really help you become better, more tolerant towards everything that surrounds you and gives you an insentive to perceive the beauty better. As a lover of classical music, I appreciate Benoit's introduction of orchestral elements into his compositions."
5,WoW,"I heard ""Miles After Dark a couple of times and decided I had to have the CD, I shoked to see ""Rejoyce"" was on this CD. I'm now trying to determine what will be the next track played on smooth jazz radio stations!"
3,"Not what I expected, but interesting.","I was hoping that this was a documentary I saw on PBS back in the 1990's, but it turned out to be a monologue by a British cat expert as he walks around his country home. He has cats all around him doing what cats do. He explains it all for us. Most interesting is his explanation of where purring comes from. All in all it was an interesting seminar on cats and their behavior. It's not as good as that documentary I'd seen, but I enjoyed it never-the-less."
3,Good Account,"I am in the unusual position of having been both a Duke and a Carolina fan, so I was interested in what Featherston proposed to add to the tale of this storied rivalry, as well as the intense competition with NCSU and Wake Forest.Featherston's writing was clean and enjoyable, but the book did not include anything that I had not already read in other titles or had already heard from other sources. It would serve more appropriately for someone wanting an introductory lesson on major ACC rivalries. For something more in-depth, other fans might want to turn to Art Chansky's ""Blue Blood : Duke-Carolina: Inside the Most Storied Rivalry in College Hoops.""That being said, don't let me stop you from reading it. It's not a bad book at all. Just not the cornucopia of knowledge I was hoping for at the time."
1,content outdated,Book is just to outdated. Web site examples used are outdated. I just can't recommend this book. If your looking for a number of internet terms it may still have some relevance .
5,It's worth you time and money.,The first chapter alone is worth the price of the book. Great ideas on writing for either traditional or web viewers. Easy to read and insightful.
2,First 30 pages are all you really need.,"I'm a huge fan of McGovern, but this book isn't worth the money. You can actually read the first section of the book - the part I really loved - at his web site for free: www.gerrymcgovern.com. The ""sample web style guide"" at the end of the book is woefully underwritten. Buy CONTENT CRITICAL instead."
1,Almost Criminal,This book is next to useless as a web style guide. Of the 224 pages only the first 35 pages are devoted to the topic of style. The rest of the book is a glossary of terms with little practical use. Most of the material presented in this book is available on the web for free and in greater detail.My first glance through the book was a disappointment. Two days later I gave it a second chance but it confirmed my first impression so I sent it back.
1,Same poor print quality on the original and replacement books I ordered!,"Can't comment on the content because both the first and second copies I received were not legible. What happened at the printer's? No quality control check, apparently, before these books were shipped for sale."
5,Intelligent and informative. A superb reference.,"If you're looking for a cybertized version of the Chicago Manual of Style, this isn't it. But if you need to migrate your writing and editing skills to the Web, there's no better place to start than the Web Content Style Guide. I frequently lecture on content development, usability, and information architecture. This book is always on my list of recommended reading.In addition to great writing guidelines and advice, there's also valuable information about the related issues of usability, navigation, and design. This is particularly important since many writers ignore these subjects thinking they are too technical or outside their area of responsibility (think again!). Keep the WCSG close at hand and your work can't help but improve."
2,Never used product,"I'm sure this item would have received a 5 star rating if I had used it; I have found Samsung products to be very good. I did not use this item because of the additional charge it would have added to my XM Satellite Radio Subscription. I already am paying costs for two radios. I purchased this item to have more portable capabilities, but I did not want to incur an additional charge on my XM account. Consequently, I returned the product without using it."
4,Much better than a MyFi...,"We used to have a MyFi and a friend purchased a Helix and neither unit is ready to be called ""portable"". If I have to hold the unit up in the air to get a signal - it's a waste. Since these units don't allow you to wear them and play them (unless you live in NY City), we opted to the Nexus. It's smaller and we don't have to ""position"" it in a attempt to get a signal. With 50 hours of music, we have lots of content for exercising, hanging at the beach and working."
2,I Wouldn't Recommend,"I decided to get a portable XM that could record. I love to listen to Coast to Coast AM, but I can not stay up and hear it at 1am. I decided on the Inno for myself and went to get it. Last minute at the store my husband wanted an XM, but was hesitant to spend the extra money for the Inno. That was about a month ago. Last night he went ahead and bought an Inno for himself.The NeXus, while cheaper, did not function as well. He had a hard time finding his recordings and they did not seem to play in order. Overall he felt that instead of an upgrade from an old Roady, this was a step back. It did not work well, he had lots of problems with playing music he loaded onto the unit. The screen was not in color. It would lock up a lot. It was a pain to carry the passport everywhere with the NeXus.I would recommend getting the Inno. In the long run you will be much happier."
2,Only so-so,"So going from the Delphi Skyfi to a Nexus here are my thoughts.I don't mind the passport idea, I like it. I used to have two accounts, one for the car and one for the house. Now I only have one and take the passport and unit with me. The ability to record XM is great, I setup a session to record Air81 on BPM. Worked great, small drop out in volume after each 1-hour set but I can live with it.Did not try loading mp3's, I don't really have any mp3's as I like XM to much.Now the problems. 7 days into using it, the unit died. All static if any output. I bought a 2nd unit, tested and found that the Passport chip is okay, but the Nexus unit itself went bad. I'm also finding that the passport chip gets VERY hot... almost unsure if it should be this warm but can't find anything online about it.I'd say, all in all. If you can find the new INNO on sale. Go for it instead."
4,Dilbert - A Treasury of Sunday Strips: Version 00 by S.Adams,"#16 of a series of Dilbert Books; this 224 page paperback book contains all the Sunday comics strips from 1995 to 1999. All the comics in this book are in color. If you want all the Dilbert Sunday comics in one book, this is it. Nice compilation."
4,About par for Dilbert.,"These are funny strips, as is usual for Scott Adams and ""Dilbert"". I dock it a star because some of these strips have appeared in previous books, but many have not."
4,Excellent,"This book is grand for people who hate working for a boss, or have in the past experienced the joy of leaving at 5 pm every day not because you have the mentality of an 'employee' but because you hate your job BECAUSE you can't stand your boss (and the boss is the problem, not you). That was a run-on sentence, and this book captures some of the running issues people face in the ""real world."" Highly recommended for your collection."
2,You blinked!,"I read gay mysteries because I like action and adventure with my romance--and because there is no such thing as a gay romance novel (unless we're talking pirates or slave princes--yeech)! So relationships mean a lot to me in a book like EYE CONTACT. I find the relationship between Mark Manning and Neil Waite tantalyzing but unsatisfying. They always talk AROUND the point of whatever it is they are jabbering on about. I did think Manning's ""temptation"" was realistic and well-handled, but as usual the reader is left out of the juicy reconciliation. Come on! And enough with Manning in jeopardy. We know he is not going to be killed off. Let's have more of Neil, and more of Neil at risk. We already know Manning's in for the long haul."
2,Interesting read,Decent story and book - buy used and save money. Or read about Dax online and gather even more info.
2,Not as pretty as the picture,"i was in search of a nice serpent ring, i found this on amazon and it looks like just what i wanted. however, this picture is very deceiving (no pun intended - haha!): the gem at the base of the serpents ""head"" on the actual ring is very dull and it sticks up too much, the ""head"" of the serpent DOES NOT look like a serpent head at all, it is just a bunch of swirly shapes in the form of an oval, and the color of the silver is NOT as bright and shiny as it looks in this picture - it looks more like lead than silver in my opinion.Also, the quality of the ring is VERY cheap, i could have paid $5 if i was bargaining for this ring. a very disappointing purchase overall."
4,nice for the price!,this ring is very nice (for the price) it is a bit thin. but fits very nice once adjusted. and looks very nice once on.these guys do good work (keepin costs very low)remember SILVER IS EXPENSIVEkeep that in mind when you see the prices.they will give you the best quality they can for the price.yepsean
4,Silver Snake Garnet Ring,"My fiance' loves it, and it came to me in less than a week after placing the order. That was a very pleasant surprise!"
1,NO Creditability,"This scale was not accurate, also the box had opened before, the wrapping plastic was tore also there were finger prints all over on the surface. I called in- focus they didn't admit the scale was used. They said they don't sale used items. I asked for exchanging they gave me a RMA number then had me reorder another one. Several days after the money back to my credit card, they charged me 20% stocking fee. I called them again, they said the wrapping packing was tore, that's exactly what I got. They didn't admit that's the item they sold was used, which means I tore down the wrapping plastic . However, The new item D7001 I reordered took almost 20 days to deliver. They sucks."
1,"Bad scale, bad service, rip-off, do not buy","I ordered an ""Ultraship"" scale in hope that it weighs accurately so I don't have to deal with the airport's hassles of opening up all the luggages to take the stuffs out.It weighed a box at 45 pounds while the health scale and the scale at the airport both showed 50 pounds. Luckly I did not stuff some more in the box before going to the airport to find out your scale was way wrong.I sent the above message to the seller and no response. Amazon is no help either. I threw the scale in the trash can, where this ""made-in-China"" piece of scr*p deserves, instead of hassling more with this bad seller.Lesson learned...don't make my mistake."
4,Ultraship 75lb Electronic Scale,"The Ultraship 75lb Electronic Digital Shipping scale is a replacement from our Pelouze scale. Our former model stopped measuring ounces after a few short weeks (could have been manufacturing defectiveness or model failure?). We like having an all purpose scale for culinary measurements, postage, or luggage weighing prior to flights.Although this seems to have all the same features as the Pelouze model, we will update this review in a year to determine how well the product performs."
4,I like it,"Overall, this scale works great! It has revolutionized the way I sell on eBay. I only have one complaint (hence the four stars). You can only read the display from a very specific angle. Otherwise, it looks like it's blank. This shouldn't be much of a problem if the scale is sitting on a counter or table. However, we tend to use it on the floor, so we often have to bend way down to get a visible reading. Not a big deal, just an inconvenience."
5,A great scale for my ebay business!,"I'll keep this short and sweet: I bought the scale in early January 2010 for the purposes of getting the appropriate weight on items for my Ebay business. This scale has not disappointed. It is almost always accurate down to the 10th of an ounce. Are there negative reviews for this item? Sure there are. It's an electronic device, and you'll always have some that are defective, no matter what the product. I think it's clear that the vast majority of people that have purchased this scale have been extremely happy just like I have which is a great indicator that this scale will likely work for you too!"
3,scale works great with batteries,I did not get the AC adapter yet as pictured. I'm still waiting for he AC adapter and its been 30 days now.
4,No Parts Available,"I did not receive the adapter with my scale. I like the scale and did not want to return it. I just wanted the adapter also as advertised. I lost the flat top plate and wanted to buy another one. It was a no go on both counts. First, I wrote the co. with copies of my receipt and registration but no response. Then I called and had to leave a message with the promise they would call back. No response. Finally, I went online with my complaint and finally got this response: ""Parts are not available"". I guess this is just another case of planned obsolescence. I like the scale but wish I didn't have to use my plastic cutting board in lieu of the top plate in order to weigh items."
3,Not the best out there.,Can be hard to zero. It has gotten a bit finicky when I try to zero the scale. Since I purchased I have seen many others that I would have chosen. I guess I basically got what I paid for.
2,Warning - Optional AC Plug means it does not actually come with it!!,"I have yet to use this item because despite the photo, it did not come with the power plug. ""optional"" means that it is not included in the package. i thought it meant that you could use either corded power or batteries (which is true, you just need to have a spare AC adaptor that has the type of connector needed to use with this item). note the instructions that come with the item do not actually clarify what type of ac adaptor to purchase, just that you should use the correct AC adaptor."
1,What a hassle!,"I have no idea how this works as a scale; the directions are so obtuse I have never finished ""assembling"" it. I'm not usually one to give up in frustration, and don't have more than the usual problems following directions, but the ones to get this assembled and working are just ridiculous. I gave up."
2,Not what I expected...,"Scale didn't come with A/C adapter(though in the picture and don't say ""not included"", the term ""optional"" is very deceiving). Also, it doesn't have the backlight on the screen or it doesn't work! I'm rather disappointed, but it will suffice for what I need it for and it's not worth my time to return it and find one with those options."
1,DECEPTIVE does not come with AC adapter,"DECEPTIVE , Ultraship 75 Digital Scale was pictured with a very obvious AC adapter but did not come with AC adapter, when I found the adapter didn't come with the scale I found you have to scroll down to read the AC adapter was optional, TRICKY. Also the headline says that it's a 75 lb scale yet the description below says it is a 55 lb scale, CONFUSING.Scale works very good and shipping was quick. Sold by DAB Nutrition and fulfilled by Amazon."
1,Died in less than a year with light use,"Button to change units was problematic from the beginning. Electronics completely went out in less than a year, and I used it maybe 12 times."
5,Accurate Scale,"I've used this for about a month now. I ship packages almost every day and it's important to get an accurate reading anywhere from a 50 lb FedEx box to a 5 oz bubble mailer. This scale does it easily, quickly, and accurately. When I weigh a package it's been accurate every time...matching the post office perfectly and at most is off by .1 oz from the FedEx scale ( but the FedEx scale may be off who knows? ).Highly recommended."
5,A triumph.,"The Butchers Theatre. A magnificent novel from Kellerman.I have not been thrilled to bits by his Alex Delaware series, as that character always strikes me as a smug rich kid with far too much time and money on his hands.However Kellerman has excelled himself here.A psychotic pseudo-Nazi killer,a team of rookie detectives trying to catch him in the holy land...Genuinely chilling stuff,especially the killers background in LA. Everything from 1980s Israel is here-from customs to retellings of legends.The book is almost like an elaborate conversation and is superb and gripping stuff.The only disappointment was the ending.Its rather predictable and a bit of a letdown.However this is an excellent book and to any Kellerman fan a must-read."
1,Not the typical Jonathan Kellerman book,"Jonathan Kellerman is one of my favorite authors, so when I started reading The Butcher's Theater I was pretty surprised. This book is not written in typical Jonathan Kellerman style--a quick and easy read that you have trouble putting down. The fact this book was set in Jerusalem was very distracting for me. The author had to spend a lot of copy explaining the cultural nuances, unfamiliar words and terms, the political environment and tensions, the ranks is the Israeli police force, etc. As a result, the storyline itself unfolded way too slowly. I put The Butcher's Theater down and read two other books before going back to it thinking maybe I just wasn't in the right frame of mind the first time. Still, on the second try, I could not get engaged. I don't think ever before in my life I've not finished a book that I started...but, I just can't bring myself to finish this one."
3,"Somewhat disappointing, but spellbinding at points.....","Many facets of Jerusalem's past & population were covered, it was sometimes too much and would detract from my interest in the plot itself. The ending read like a screenplay - too much like a tv movie. The plot seemed drawn out and the ""ends"" weren't tied together quite well enough. Good, but not a great mystery. I don't agree with the jacket reviews that the ending rivals Ken Follet's EYE OF THE NEEDLE. I'll try another of Jonathan Kellerman's books, but this one didn't thrill me"
1,Cheap Edition - Impossible to read,This book was so cheap the print went right into the binding. I ended up leaving the book in a coin laundry.
1,Tedious,I am a fan of Jonathan Kellerman - have read all of his books and enjoyed most of them. This was the last one I read. It was too long - so many diversions that did not advance the story. It seemed that JK was caught between writing a mystery/crime novel and writing a history of the conflict between the Palestinians and Israels. This books was about 300 pages too long and very boring in many places. This was JK fourth novel and I am glad that he got his sights back on target.
4,All Jonathan Kellerman's books are good,"This is another great book of Jonathan Kellerman's. It doesn't star his usual detective, Alex Delaware, but in one of the books written later, the star of this book meets Alex Delaware. Anyway, you can't go wrong with a book by Jonathan Kellerman. (But his wife Faye is too gory for my taste.)"
4,The book was very entertaining,"The detective was very smart and throughout the book, I came to like him. I would recommend it to anyone who likes to read about crazy psychopathic killers. The author's authenticy about Isreali lifestyle was very accurate. I am half Isreali and this made me want to go back to Isreal again. But back to the book.... you might forget it in a month or two, but it was very entertaining while you read it."
3,Disapointment! Too slow.,"I was very disappointed in ""Butcher's Theater,"" having read all of The Alex Delaware novels with the exception of ""Survival of the Fittest."" I felt the author took too long to bring everything to a head and solve the crime. I do look forward to meeting the Israeli policeman, Daniel Sharavi, when he arrives in Los Angles to work with the LAPD in ""Survival."""
1,Critique of the book as racist,"I read The Butcher's Theatre some years ago, and recently read the reviews featured here. I am surprised that no one commented on the books most striking feature - its racist portrayal of the Arabs, and a corresponding idealisation of Israeli society. The frequent excursions into political history were very baised, and did not advance the plot. Given the authors standpoint, one knew from early on that the killer could not be Jewish, and this detracted from the suspense. The author is a psychologist, yet he shows very little understanding of his own prejudices. The virulent passage in which he accuses Arab men in the Israeli prison camp ""Al-Ansar"" of homosexuality (of all things - the least of their probelms in that hell hole) was very revealing of Kellerman's own mind. He might like to read some European anti-Semitic fictions from the early 20th century, where Jews are routinely accussed of corruption, murder, lust and homosexuality."
2,Anti-muslim seems to be OK,"Having enjoyed Kellerman's Delaware stories,I happened on this one and was stunned by his cultural/racial bias. It is astounding how often the Arabs, Turks, Bedouins, Muslims are described as ""sweat stained,"" ""filthy,"" ""lazy"" and ""shiftless."" The idiot Arab boy and the dishonest shop keepers are typical. The Israelis are always industrious, clean, eager to do the job. The ""good"" Arab detective, Mahoud, isn't even Muslim--he's Christian! The description of the 1947 and 1967 wars are difficult to consume, knowing the complexity of the issues then. This was an old (1988) book, and one hopes that Kellerman will stick to his detective/psychologist stories."
3,"Enjoyable, but not a page-turner","I've enjoyed Kellerman as a new find this year; I've read every one of his books since April, THE BUTCHER'S THEATER being the last. Normally, I can't wait to finish his work, staying up later than my wife would like and taking longer lunch breaks than my boss would like. I usually finish his novels in 2-3 days. This one, however, didn't grab me like the others. Perhaps it was the unfamiliar locale that distracted me, but it took me 2 weeks to finish it, and frankly, it didn't bother me if I didn't get a chance to read it. The characterizations were good, as Kellerman's usually are, but I found the psychopath and his ""political"" leanings a little trite. I never felt like he was as scary as he was made out to be. This book also suffers from Kellerman's biggest weakness: endings. The ""big confrontation"" that is telegraphed from about half-way through the book is not entirely satisfactory."
3,"Rather slow, but it grows on you...","I enjoy the Alex Delaware series, and I also liked the two books featuring Petra Connors, so I thought I would try this, after encountering Sharavi in ""Survival of the fittest"".This book is different from the ones taking place in LA, and it IS slow, sometime to the point of boredom. But after about a hundred pages, you want to go on reading it, despite the fact that it continues being slow. The characters are reasonably well developed, especially Sharavi. The book is atmospheric but, never having been to Israel, I cannot tell how accurately it depicted Jerusalem at the time. And the book is quite old, so probably things have changed dramatically since.The parts featuring the killer are disturbing and seem somewhat extreme but, for all I know about serial killers, the description might even be plausible.I did not find it as absorbing as I usually find thrillers but if one reads it more as a novel that happens to have homicides in it, it is good."
3,Too explicit,"The Butcher's Theater- Way to gruesome for me. I liked the characters, and the story line, but I had to skip some of the parts because they were upsetting and gory."
2,One more pulp read,Jonathan Kellerman can do much better. Has he run out of ideas? I found his earlier books better written and better plots.
1,Extremely racist book,"Having lived and worked in Jerusalem for four years, I was looking forward to reading this novel set in that intriguing and complex city. It was a huge disappointment--incredibly racist. I expect Kellerman thinks he gets away with it, because the two main characters, a Jewish American and an African American detective, are well-developed and sympathetically drawn. Unfortunately his Arab characters are very superficial, distorted and stereotypical: a knife loving Arab, exploitive of women, duplicitous, Nazi-allied, a horrifically sadistic serial killer. If similar characters had been written about any other ethnic group, a publisher wouldn't have touched it. Really disgustingly racist."
3,Ho-Hum,"I have to agree with the majority of views, here. This novel was an odd embarkment from the Alex Delaware series, and didn't really have the flowing plot that you come to expect from a Kellerman read."
4,Johnny's Most Complete Collection,"This 2-disc collection contains just about all his American and British-charted hits, plus a few others of his very best vocal performances. In my opinion, it's his best collection (with great quality sound, too) and best package for your money. Although I personally didn't care for a couple of the tracks on this collection, it has all the classic tracks that make him stand out as one of the greatest, most successful, and most distinctive-sounding male vocalists of the 20th century. I greatly recommend this!"
4,Good music,Great compilation. Really brought me back to my youth when I used to listen this music in the clubs and on the radio.
5,Capone,This was one of the best movies I've seen in a while. The director completely captured the idea of mobsters which is Capone. This movie changed my outlook on life.
5,Should be required Photography reading!,"This book introduced me to many documentary photographers that were ignored by my art school. I am glad to have discovered it and have shared it with friends. The author, Ken Light, is also a photographer and has completed many excellent documentary projects, most notably Texas Death Row. Very inspiring!"
4,Enjoyed,"Well written and engaging story. Some words seemed too modern for the time period, but the plot was good and kept my interest."
4,Kindleread,I had just finished reading another Susan King book that referred to this Title. I enjoyed the book so much that I did a search for this one. I was not disappointed it held my interest all the way through. I am currently reading a third book by this author. Thanks Amazon for having such a wide variety.
4,"Unusual premise, fascinating characters, excellent story.","Susan King's characters shine in this story. Lady Isobel, the 'fey' Scotswoman whose visions foretell the future, and James Lindsay, the outlaw who believes her visions destroyed his life and reputation are pawns of fate, and of men willing to sacrifice them to achieve their own ends. Vengence and innocence war to a satisfying conclusion in this well-written story of love and destiny."
2,A disappointment,"Laird of the Wind had all the elements of a wonderful romance but it was a disappointment. The dialog between the two main characters was at times so unbelievable that I found myself snickering!Too much of the book is dedicated to a falcon and it's training, then it drops off. One would think that the falcon must have some important part in the story for the author to go on and on about it but it didn't.James is being hunted by both the English and the Scots, kidnaps Isobel, and is trying to save his cousin Margaret. But, he finds the time to tame a wild falcon which includes sleepless nights and patience. Come on!This is the first review I have ever written. I'm not happy that it is a negative one but I read all the reviews before I purchase a book (which were positive) only to be disappointed after reading the book so I thought another opinion should be included."
3,More history than romance,"While I enjoy authenticity in historical fiction, there is a fine line between 'history book/lesson' and compelling story. The emphasis on the falconry elements overwhelmed the story and had it teetering on the brink of abject boredom. What should have been a sizzling romance was tepid at best and the final reveal far less noteworthy than we were led to expect. It pushed suspension of disbelief to the edge in compelling us to wade through endless goshawk lesson sessions that did little or nothing to move the plot along. In fact all it did was define the characters as being 'patient to a fault', casting them a one-dimensional framework at best. I didn't give up but I found it to be less than satisfying."
2,history minus the romance,"I've ordered many books from Amazon but have never taken the time to review one before now. I like Scottish history and the story concept sounded interesting, so I had high hopes for this book when I ordered it. It is obvious that Ms. King put a great deal of research into this book and the historical content is excellent. However, the 2nd word in the historical romance genre is ""romance"" which was, unfortunately, seriously lacking in this story. In many places throughout the book the dialogue seems to be specifically designed to impart some historical fact or another to the reader, rather than flowing as a natural conversation between characters. In short, this story reads more like an history lesson than it does a romance and I can now say I know more than I ever cared to about goshawks."
2,Disappointed again,"This is the second book I have read by this author and it was as disappointing as the first. This book lacks the action, the humor and the building of the romantic connection that I have found in books from Garwood and Quick.I found the historical content to be intriguing and the way she wove the William Wallace legend into the book. Beyond this it was hard to stick with the book. I found myself running through the boring sections to get to the more interesting section and then discovered that all of the interesting sections are at the end of the book.I probably should have just started reading at page 200."
3,Ladies of the Wind,Interesting read but not enough vavavoom. The characters were dynamic with plenty of angst. The idea behind the story is well crafted. I felt that the story became lost in the details and I longed for more heat between the main characters.
5,Listed of the wind,I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I love historical fiction. The characters in this book really brought the story to life. I can't wait to read the next book in this series!
3,Laird no mystery novel,Laird of the Wind started out with interest but i found it repeated itself too much for my liking. I prefer a little more mystery.
