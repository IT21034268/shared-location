2,This review is left as an exercise...,"It seemed to me while using the book that every example I would have liked to see was left as an exercise. I have read reviews saying that there are many examples but that is the opposite of what I have observed. Additionally, several times the answer in the back of the book was incorrect and the class would bring this to the attention of the instructor."
3,Flawed but worth watching,"I'm a big Burton fan but I can only give Villain a 3 star recommendation. On the plus side Villains theme, location, action and dialogue are a signpost to later T.V icon series 'The Sweeney' and the modern Brit gangster genre. I also tip my hat to the convincing cast, writers and director. Nevertheless for me Vic Dakin the main gangster character required a younger Burton in his Mark Anthony prime to affect a more menacing physicality; much like Oliver Reed achieves in a similar role in `Sitting Target'. Coincidently Ian McShane alternatively plays with aplomb the main mans shag and side kick in both movies. That the Sweeney series in particular is the improved step child of Villain in terms of direction and development is fame enough. Yet Villain in itself remains a disjointed work in progress, rather than the finished article. Flawed but worth watching."
4,Pleasantly Surprised,"I bought the first book in this collection on a whim and have been delighted with the entire series. Usually, with serials, the second part is not as strong as the first and third parts because the second part is merely there to transition from the beginning to the end but in this case the author has managed to continue the dramatic tension throughout the series brilliantly. There is truly something for everyone--adventure, romance, history, fantasy--and because of the brevity the books are so easily read that you almost feel cheated because you want more. But there is more! And that's what a good serial ought to do--leave the reader wanting more!"
4,A delightful read,"The Little Nobody by Violet Winspear~ Harlequin Presents #15 ~ July 1973I have always adored Violet Winspear's stories. While this one was published in 1973, I find it holds the test of time. Our heroine is of course quite young, as was common in the early Presents. The hero is bitter and trying to find his way in a brand new life as his life as a composer and symphony conductor was robbed from him in a brutal accident. And as in all the early Presents we don't see the heroes POV until the end of the book when he declares his love, but that doesn't keep this book from being a delightful read."
4,Orson Scott Card: Beyond Ender's Game,"All three of these books put together in one collection was a great idea. I had trouble finding these books seperatley at a resonable price. As other reviews have said, these books are much slower paced than Ender's Game and the parrallel series that follows mainly Bean and Petra. But, their content is great with very thoughtful story lines. For those people that just want the fast paced and high intensity action books, stick with Ender's Shadow, Shadow of the Hegemon and Shadow Puppets. But if you want to find yourself actually thinking during a book, get this set."
2,Not worth the purchase,"By the end of Ender's Game, the Ender story feels complete. Author Card may have agreed, as the following stories take Ender and his tale in an entirely new direction. If you just stick to Ender's Game, you won't feel at a loss. These stories feel extraneous and the characters are too certain of their own righteousness to be believable."
5,Awesome books and in great condition!,The books were brand new and weren't damaged at all. Fast shipping!
5,Beyond Ender,"Contrary to what people say. This set of book has much to do with Ender's Game. Not only does Ender's Game give insight into Ender for the next books but it also shows the way humanity reacted to a threat to their race. The whole saga is about the evolution of humanity. In Ender's Game the human race reacts violently against the aliens even without a perfect understanding of them but what had to be done was done. The next 3 books show how people after the bugger wars react to a similar situation. Ender is more like the role model of humanity's goal. All humans despise Ender for what he did in the Bugger wars but then a threat of a similar nature comes around and history starts to repeat itself. All in all, The Ender Saga is a look into the human mind and a look at humanity's evolution over the course of 3000 years. It was very well written and always interesting and exciting. Probably the best books i've ever read or will read."
1,Cost,"This gets one star because of the cost, over $100 increase!!! How does this go from so reasonably priced to an untouchable cost??"
1,Realities by Liz Claiborne,This item does not smell right. I have purchased this before and was finishing up my last bit in the last bottle. Opened up this bottle just recently and there is no comparison in fragrance. It almost smells like pure alcohol. I would not recommend it. Although I guess something could have happened during shipping. I guess I cannot return it because of the time frame. I sure wish I would have opened it when I first received it.
3,"big bottle, light smell","people can only smell it when they are up under you otherwise, no sign of wearing anything .. it's light and fresh and big ..."
2,perfume smell not quite right and color is orange instead of pink,beware! the color is way off( orange perfume instead of pink) smell is ok- a bit off but is acceptable.
5,A Must-read for study groups!,"Dr. Fred Scarbrough reveals why serving God provides you with dramatically improved personal relationships. ""It's Not About You"" carries the reader through Scarbrough's journey of climbing the ladder of worldly success, only to find out that, once there, the view didn't look so good. The author's story is one of personal transformation along with practical applications, and is an excellent study guide (complete with questions at the end of each chapter) for groups. Dr. Scarbrough is the founder and Lay Pastor of The Shepherd's Way, a homeless ministry in Ft. Lauderdale, Florida."
2,okay,it was okay. if you are not used to lecture type literature it could be hard to follow. but hey it was free so worth tthe read wouldnt spend any money on it though
3,too detailed n 'dry' for a person new to yoga.,The text is a little to 'dry' to a person new to yoga. It will not keep one's interest. Its more for someone who already some background knowledge of yoga to apprehend Kate this book.
1,Too simple,"A very basic overview of yoga. I was looking for something more thorough. But it was free, so why complain..."
2,Not what I expected,Its a tad bit difficult to read on the Kindle Fire. Has good info as long as you already know something about yoga. If your a newbie....find a different book. =/
2,Way too technical,I found this book to be way to indepth and too technical for a beginner. This is more for an advanced yoga participant. I couldnt' get through the first 2 pages without yawning.
3,Not enough,"I need more pictures and less words. In Yoga, I need to see the pose not just read the name and automatically know which one it is."
5,INFO...,"The higher class man's version of GIRLS GONE WILD, CONFESSIONS OF A PARTY GIRL captures the decadent ways of the world's most hedonistic, lascivious ladies. Shockingly candid and sinfully sexy, these gals expose the deepest details of their partying ways."
1,My dog won't take this,"Will have no idea how good this product is because my dog refuses to take it no matter what we do to disguise it. The pill is HUGE - SERIOUSLY GIGANTIC even for my 60 pound hunting dog. Tried pulverizing it and adding it to her food. Plus, it stinks. Anyone want 179 dog vitamins, cheap???"
3,Good Vitamins Bad Seller,"I purchased these vitamins from entirely pets but I had used them previously from a local feed store. The vitamins are excellent but when I received this bottle the box, bottle and contents smelled highly of pesticides (just like roach spray). My dog wouldn't touch the vitamins in this bottle and she normally eats them with no problem. I won't purchase anything from entirely pets again. Find this Vitamin from another seller."
2,Neither dog will eat it.,I even tried to hide their pills in canned food but they usually eat around it. I'm sure it's good...just not good for my dogs.
3,NO FRILLS Collection of Flute STUDIES (For Grade 3) - 5 star material & pricing SANS the gloss,"[NOTE MY BOOK 2 HAS A DIFFERENT COVER - edited by Robert Cavally - it has a LEMON YELLOW BACKGROUND WITH BROWN WRITINGS BUT WITHOUT THE HARPIST]Melodious and Progressive Studies Book 2 edited by Robert Cavally.For flute. Woodwind Solos & Ensembles - Flute Studies.Studies from Andersen, Gariboldi, Koehler and Terschak.64 pages.Instructional and Studies. Grade 3 Collection - BUT LOOKS MUCH HARDER than today's books eg Paul Harris'76 Graded Studies Book 1 (Grades 1-5)!Great value. For the already self motivated flute lovers who love their daily practical drills - invaluable!Not in keeping with today's glossy trends with accompanying discussion notes - nevertheless - a classic std."
5,I am blessed,"This music is very easy to play and listen to not matter what the situation. It is uplifting to my spirit; spirit food, I could say."
5,Great Ratcheting Feature!,"This wrench has a great ratcheting action! It is a great wrench in every way, and I would highly recommend it to anyone!"
3,doesn't keep time,"It's a beautiful clock and compliments the Royal Doulton China. However, after changing batteries several times and tightening the screws, it still does not keep the right time."
2,Not worth your time,"Sounds like a good story but it is very badly written. While there may be lots of info about scotland in the 1200s the story is poorly told, the writing cumbersome. IF you were in a cell and had only this book for entertainment, it might be worth reading. If you had two books, read the other one."
4,Crown in Darkness,"I am reading the Hugh Corbett series and find them to be very good. The history is understandable. The subject is interesting. The daily lives and settings are revealing. Normally we receive a cleaned up view of the past when, in fact, life was anything but clean. And, the people who were less than well-to-do were often considered worth less than a good cow. Finally I can understand that slice of English history."
5,By Far the Best Craft Book I have EVER seen!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I just got the book the otherday and I have alreadly flagged about 30 items I want to do ASAP... It's amazing...and I saw the other book same publisher ""365 simply handmade easy projects for every occaision...."" I want to get that book too, its almost as incredible as this book! page after page is crammed with the easiest most inspiring elegant ideas.... never seen a book so awesome... I'll be the envy of the neighborhood.... YOU'VE GOTTA BUY THIS BOOK, its probably the only craft book you'll ever need... SERIOUS!!!! (I really really like the beaded candle idea) and about 30 other simple yet elegant items!!! (one thing, I just wish they had some ""St. Patrick's Day Crafts)...."
3,PACKED WITH CLEVER IDEAS!,"If you are exhausted by what to get for whom not only at Christmas time but through out the year, here are some clever ideas to refresh your creativity and ""stretch"" your pocket book, money-wise, as well. Serving trays, festive package trims, gilded ornaments, gift bags, candy holders. Don't wrack your brain, anymore. Relax, read the book, follow the suggestions and delight your friends and family with the personal touch of handcrafted gifts."
4,"Beautiful, but still hard for a novice","I love this book--it has wonderful tips and ideas. Many beautiful gifts and decorations can be made from such simple things! But, as a crafts novice, I have struggled to find some of the materials. Although I live in a major metropolitan area, and have been to 4 craft and fabric stores, some critical elements are just not available. Unfortunately, I'm not knowledgeable enough yet to know what to substitute. I'm not ready to give up, but this is taking a lot more time than I expected!"
5,Mind Filling!,"This one is a delight to just sit and look through, as well as a great mix of craft ideas and decorating tips that will leave your holiday guests wondering how you pulled it all off! It has kid crafts and some that you would think only a serious crafter would do, but the directions make it all easy! Very Nicely Done!"
5,outshines most crafting books,I checked this book out from the library and have made two things from it already. This is a great book for the whole family. Easy instructions and supplies are more normal than most craft books. Loved it so much had to buy it!
4,Crafting through the year,"This hard cover (200+ page) book covers gifts and decorations for Spring, Summer, Fall, & Winter seasons.Slick, full-color illustrations of the various projects range from very quick to somewhat more involved crafting. Not a lot of step-by-step directions or patterns; but more reliant on clear pictures and text instructions that cover the many projects.A nice reference book for the seasoned crafter - but not too intimidating for the beginning crafter.I purchased a used book which arrived promptly and in very nice condition."
3,Not Impressed,"I was so excited to get this book because I start crafting and making Christmas gifts this time of year. There were literally a handful of items I would be interested in making. Most of the projects in this book are junky items or for very beginners or children. I wanted a more elegant choice of gifts to pick from and was left with very little. Honestly, I would not give away any of the items featured in this book. If you have even a minimal amount of crafting experience I think this book would be too elementary for you. I would send it back but not worth the shipping costs."
3,Not for advanced crafters,"This craft book is not a book for experienced crafters. The projects in the book are very simple but nice. I only found one project I would actually create. This book is definately for beginner crafters or younger crafters, I myself am 21 and even I could not see myself creating any of this cheap crafts. For me, the crafts were too simple and did not look like anything I would ever make as gifts or decorate my home with. Luckally, one of my younger cousins fell in love with some of the projects to make for her friends on her small budget."
3,Too Much Repetition,"Good information for anybody in sales, and probably worth the price of the book, but I found it to be very repetitive. ""Vendors sell like this, but Consultative Sellers sell like that."" Then I skipped a few chapters ahead - same thing. I'm an independent consultant who has recently added a couple of product lines, so I'm new to product sales. I personally like Alan Weiss's books, especially Million Dollar Consulting or The Ultimate Consultant, which explains the same philosophy - sell results to the client, not your product - but has more details about how to do it. Save yourself some time and read one of Weiss's books and apply it to your sales."
3,Decent concept,"I got this book thinking it would deal with how to sell idea's. It's focus relates is moving from a price based purchaser interface sales model to a function based user sales model.I like it for the general philosophy, but is was geared more for the sales individual. It also focused too much on other stuff you could get from the author."
1,SANTA FORGOT BATTERY,"I totally agree with a former complaint about needing this battery for the TERRAIN TWISTER ($50 toy). In tiny writing, it says this flex-pack is not included. Why would a toy that costs this much come without the battery? Why couldn't they have put on the box in BIG letters - purchase TMH flex-pack. I still would have gotten the Terrain Twister - my son wanted it for Christmas. Well, the Terrain Twister still sits here - no battery. It really sucks - I hate Tyco. Angry Mom!"
1,The Worst Experience Ever!!!!,"I ordered online the Tyco RC Terrain Twister. Never once did it offer to sale me the TMH Flexpak. My son was dissapointed on Christmas day as well as the other children in the earlier reviews.I called every toy store in my area, and none of them have this batter pack in store. So I have to order it and wait for delivery. Now, after calling the support # on the ""Contents/Features"" booklet, all I got was a recorded message.Tyco can do much better by their customers. On a products like these, the batteries should be included or at least offered at the time of purchase. And I agree with an earlier comment above, that they should sale the batteries seperately and not make you buy a charger each time. If the batteries run about $10 why do I have to spend an extra $20 on the charger each time. Tyco is going to stay rich, while continuing to take us to the bank. They should be exposed."
1,TMH Flex Pac,I am happy to know that I am not the only parent who bought their child a Terrain Twister for Christmas and did not realize until Christmas morning that I needed a TMH Plex Pac to run it. No problem- go to Toys R Us and pick one up. That was three weeks ago and we have been to Toys R Us 8 times. They don't have the Flex Pac and don't know when and if they will get it. Shame on Tyco for selling such a product without the proper battery and for not being able to fill the demand. I might as well have given my son a broken stick for Christmas. That would probably be more useful than a Terrain Twister which has been sitting in a corner for three weeks.
3,...,"BEWARE!!!! When the vehicle is purchased, be forwarned that a special, hard to find battery pack, sold only by Tyco, and separtely from the toy, is as much as the toy itself. In addition, you cannot buy just the battery, the charger is always included, so spare batteries are out of the question."
1,What a rip-off!,"Our grandson specifically asked for this toy for Christmas, and we ordered it online from Toys 'r Us. It amazes me that the website description wasn't specific enough to make shoppers aware that the toy wouldn't operate without this VERY EXPENSIVE battery pack. Giving us the option of making a fully informed decision (bundling the toy with the battery pack, for example, and noting that one won't work without the other)would have been greatly appreciated, because this grandson was the only one of 5 to receive something he really wanted that was completely useless on Christmas day!We will not purchase any other TYCO toys, because we prefer to deal with ethical companies. Toys 'r Us might consider being more thorough in their descriptions as well - we're not likely to return something a grandchild had his heart set on, but we will be more careful in the future when we shop online at Toys 'r Us."
2,Not charging in UK ???,"Hello,I brought this product recently, description is good, product got delivered to me on time in US. i brought this to UK when my son lives and from the time i opened the battery product it doesnt seem to be charging at all. not sure whether we need to change or use an different adaptor while in UK. at the moment its of no use for him and i am very disappointed.i dont find the adaptor or battery heating up even after a full night charge when i use it in the toy it doesnt move at all. so my 4 yr son still waits for his toy to work.not sure whether there is a solution if not then probably i will return this as soon as possible."
1,tyco is ok but they RIP YOU OFF!!!,my mom bot me shell shocker for x mas but on the box it did say you needed the $30.00 battery pack but on the back in small ryting so my mom asked the store cleark if you neended anymore parts she said no of course (tyco probly turned her into a servent)but luckuly we went to superstore today and they just got the chargers in so i bot one but in the end shell shocker is really fun
1,Dead Battery - Dead Toy - Dead Customer Service,"Fortunately, my wife did discover that you needed the $35 flexpak battery when she bought the Terrain Twister before Christmas. She wasn't happy, but she bought it. Unfortunately, the battery pack never worked, and neither has the toy. It's worthless. My wife has been trying to return it through customer service, but was refused - and harrassed - by Tyco who accused her of ""burning up the battery by plugging it into the charger wrong or leaving it plugged in longer than 5 hours"". First of all, it's possible that we plugged the battery in backwards into the charger, since it will fit both ways. As a degreed technical manager in an electronics field, I'll say ""bad design"". Second, since when has there been a battery charger that you can only leave in for exactly the amount of time and no more? No more Tyco for our household and for our disappointed son."
1,incorrect battery pack for Shell Shocker,"I purchased a Shell Shocker ($59.00)for my son's birthday and this item is shown in the TOYSRUS page on AMAZON to be the battery pack for it. So I purchased this item also(additional $30.00). I got it home and charged it overnight. My son inserted it into the Shell Shocker and .... NOTHING.. I called TYCO and they said ""you have to use the battery pack specified on the box"" ...COOL MOVE TOYS R US...merchandising the wrong battery...."
1,Huge disappointment!!!,I'm another mom returning Terrain Twister by Tyco after a huge disappoinment on Christmas day. I'm not spending more than $30 in a battery pack that was expected to come with the $70 toy. The information provided is incomplete and misleading.
4,Battery Pack Is A RIP OFF!!!!,"Santa got the tyco REWINDER for my son for X-Mas 2003.It was the first present he wanted to use.We put the batteries into the controller and proceeded to operate the vehicle.Needless to say, it did not work!!!!My husband and I read the box 3 times and it made it seem like the TMH flex pac came in the box. Found out you have to purchase it for 30 extra $$$$$."
1,Hancuffed Consumer vs. Customer Service,"I have 2 kids and together they have about 8 various vehicles that take the flexpack ""flash charge"" battery. My kids LOVE their Speed Wrenches and their Jack Knife(s). The Motocross Bikes are awesome too. Anyway, I was told by the company about 1.5 years ago that they were going to sell the batteries seperately. Well, to my knowledge, they never have. I would love to be able to buy the battery separately. I cannot afford to but the charger every time I purchase a battery. I am very disappointed about this ""handcuffing"" of me the consumer. They have the monopoly on the flexpack and are using it to force you to buy the charger since the bateries are not sold separately. I was told that they would be about 9.99 alone. I would buy about 8 more for extras. What ever happened to customer service? Please start selling the batteries seperately."
1,No Battery No Fun,It's kind of hard to recommend this product when there isn't a battery to be found for miles. Especially when the battery costs more than the RC car itself. It will go back to the store. T R Us
1,Rip Off,"My son received this toy as a gift. I made sure I had the 9 voltz battery so he could play with it with his friends. I had never heard of that kind of battery pack before or even that battery packs existed. Most toys take AA's. When I saw the marking on the front of the box I thought it was a name for something the toy did not a battery it needed...and $36.00 for batteries!!! I won't by tis brand again either. Great toy but rip off with the batteries! Needless to say, my son couldn't play with his toy on his birthday. We even went out to buy them but it seems the only place that had them was Toys R Us so far. Not again."
1,Same as everyone else!!,"It is now January 13th and my son has yet to play with the only real TOY he got from Santa. Every day he asks when we're going to get the battery and every day I check a couple places and again I find nothing! I am shocked (probably shouldn't be) that a toy company would be so deceitful and blatantly greedy in regards to the kids. I am now stuck with a toy that he can't play with and we can't return because we no longer have the box. I feel Tyco and Mattel Toys owes us a recall and a full refund on this toy. Merry Christmas to you Mr. Mattel, I bet your kid had a battery for his Terrain Twister on Christmas morning, tell us was it as much fun as the commercial said? You know the commercial that had our kids foaming at the mouth for over 3 months only to be left holding their motionless toys in their hands."
1,consumer fraud,"We bought our son the Tyco Terrain Twister for Christmas. It did not come with a battery or charger. I did not notice this notice on the package. Two weeks after Christmas I was able to order the battery and charger on line (additional $44.00 tax and shipping & handling)because we could not find it in stores around us. After charging as the directions said, the toy worked for less than a minute before it quit working. I am surprised and apalled that such a large toy company doesn't recall all these toys and refund money. The advertising is fraud as far as our experience goes.This will be returned to the toy store and a not exchanged. Tyco is going to receive a letter from us!"
1,sad little boy,I would have to echo the review from two disappointed children! I was also sucked in by the toys r us marketing that suggested the 9.6 volt battery. We live in the Northeast and had a great snow storm last night and were all set to use the terrain twister for our son while we shoveled today and low and behold the battery isn't the right one. It wasn't cheap for the 9.6 volt and now we have to purchase (first find) the flex pack battery. I don't know if it was Tyco or Toys R Us that thought up this marketing scheme but it was a good one! The reason my review is all 1 star is because we haven't been able to try it out!!!!!!!!!!!
1,TMH Flexpak Battery,"The rating should read minus 10! As if the world needs more disposable over priced garbage, this rechargeable battery pack is hazardous waste, yet the manufacturer Tyco/Mattel refuses to disclose the type of battery contained in the Flexpak, which means, as a consumer, you are stuck with this thing, it is irresponsible and possibly illegal in your community to dispose of rechargeable batteries in the trash, many are highly toxic. Great toy Huh?"
1,Why would Toys R Us put up with this from Tyco?,"I'd like to chime in to the other reviews -- my 9 year old can't even play with his biggest toy under the tree. I can't get a hold of a battery pack, can't even put one on hold (they laughed at me at the store!) and will have to pay $ more for the privlege. This item is a dud and will go back to ToysRUs ASAP. I'm quite upset with both ToysRUs and Tyco. I suggest a boycott of both."
1,What a rip off,"We purchased Tycos Terrain Twister for my 9 year old son at Christmas. [...] On Christmas morning my son was SO excited to open this and could not wait to try it out. However, the $19.99 battery pack we purchased along with the Twister was NOT compatable with the Twister and we are stuck with a $20 battery that is useless. On top of the wasted money on the battery pack we scoured the local stores for the FlexPak and NO ONE had them available. It is now Jan. 7th and the Terrain Twister is still sitting in his room - unused. I found the flexpack today and ordered it- but NEVER would have purchased the Twister had I known I'd be paying $35 - PLUS SHIPPING for a BATTERY. Amazon needs to CLEARLY state what battery needs to be purchased for the Twister and that you have to purchase the battery seperately to even use the car. I'll never order another Tyco RC product again."
1,What a[n upset],"I can't believe that this toy did not include the batteries. I was stupid enough to buy 2 of them and of course the boxes were destroyed on Christmas Day so the thought of returning them is out of the question. Too bad I have [$$] worth of plastic that the kids didn't give a second look at since they didn't ""work""."
1,Rip off by Tyco,"I bought the Air Rebound R/C car for my nephew for Christmas, only to hear him sob upon opening the box and finding out that it didn't contain this battery pack. No where on the Air Rebound box does it say Battery Pack sold separately, and there is a picture of it on the box. Even the instructions show a picture of it. This is a case of a forced extra sale that costs almost as much as the toy itself. Most parents, aunts and uncles like me are forced to buy it once their little tyke has the toy in his or her hands and wants to play with it. Needless to say, I am boycotting Tyco. ..."
2,FALSE ADVERTISEMENT,"I bought my son the TYCO Rewinder toy 2 years ago for Christmas. I put it up and am just now buying batteries for it. I too feel very deceived by TYCO for not advertising up front regarding the need for the special battery. Now when I get the battery in the mail, I realized I need TWO batteries for the rewinder to work. I will not buy another TYCO Product. I feel something needs to be done about FALSE ADVERTISING!"
1,Thank You,Thank you to all the people that took time to write a review about Terrain Twister that Santa was about to purchase.Because of you Santa has become wiser and has decided against Terrain Twister and the battery pack that Santa wouldn't have even known to purchase. Santa will now purchase another brand of remote control car. Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!
4,Not A TRU issue,"In response to an earlier review I have to say the price hike (TRU SCHEMESS LOL ) is NOT TRU. My understanding is that the name ""Toys R Us"" for Toysrus.com is LICENSED to AMAZON. TRU really has no say in what Amazon does with it's pricing. This is also why prices are different between here and in the stores. I bought one for my son when the stores had a month long promo for a FREE TMH flexpack with purchase of the Terrain Twister. One hellof a deal IMHO. Usually only the VERY cheap quality RC cars come with a battery, and it is VERY clear in the bottom left corner of all the packages I've seen that the TMH is required and in fact sold seperately. Doesn't seem misleading at all to me. Is it a way to make the cars seem less expensive than they really are? You betcha, Many people (Myself included) would have looked elsewhere for a gift if my son wanted an RC car that was pushing $90, but for a $55 with a free battery that I can use in future cars it ain't bad :)"
2,Battery review,"I bought the Tyco Nitro Dozer for my son at Christmas about 3 or 4 years ago. I was very annoyed when I discovered that it did not include the battery, and I refused to buy one subsequently. We now have a renewed interest in RC vehicles, and I'm reconsidering. However, [$$$] does seem like a lot, particularly since only one of our vehicles can use it."
1,Angry at Tyco's battery pack sales tactic,I am just another one of the many unhappy customers who have purchased a Tyco R/C vehicle that needs a TMH Flexpak battery and charger. Then found out when my son opened it on Christmas Day that they are not included. Then again to discover that no store in the greater Seattle area has one to buy. I have searched many stores the past week only to end up buying one on line. Tyco should change their sales tactic and include the battery and charger with the vehicle.
1,Wheres the batteries?,I finally purchased two of the terrain twisters after two years of trying to have my kids disappointed because they did not come with batteries. I am 100 miles from the closest toys are us so it will be a few days before my kids can enjoy their gifts. In the past when I have bought remote control toys I have only had to purchase a 9volt battery for the remote because the specialized battery was enclosed. Big disappointment from tyco for my two sons.
1,RIP-OFF!!!,I certainly agree with the previous review. I purchased two Tyco RC's as Christmas gifts for my children to the tune of $120.00 !! Imagine my surprise and my childrens disappointment when we realized that we needed a battery pack costing almost as much as the toy itself! Both toys will be returned and I'll not purchase from Tyco again!! Toys R Us should seriously consider banning Tyco from its stores.
1,"Unhappy Mother, Son and Grandpa","Along with the other reviewers, I am a disappointed mother. My father bought the Terrain Twister for my son for Chirstmas, not realizing of course, that the TMH Flexpak was not included. We have been searching since then without success for the extra battery. So, not only do I have a disappointed son, but my father also feels bad for not knowing that the battery wasn't inlcluded. Way to go Tyco."
1,No batteries available,"Santa got my son the Tyco Vertigo for Christmas. I have searched all over town for the flexpak, but everywhere is sold out. You can say all you want about how people should read the packages, but the fact is the stores are not even stocking enough batteries to be used with the toys that are sold. Shouldn't they at least have as many batteries as they do toys that take these batteries. I think that it is irresponsible for a company to allow companies such as Wal-mart, Toys R Us, Kmart, Target, and Meijers to request a large number of their toys without re-enfoircing the fact that they will need special battery packs for these toys to operate. I think there should also be a sign on the shelf stating this fact."
1,TMH battery has limited availability,Finding this TMH battery pack is a hassel. I bought the TycoTerrain Twister for my grandson which was quite a bit more thanwhat I budget per grand child. I bought what was listed on thepackage which was a 9.6v plus 6 AA batteries for the remote. Itwas very disappointing that the TMH battery pack was not available at purchase. Two weeks after Christmas I am stillsearching for this pack and my gradson is upset since it was oneof his major gifts that he asked Santa for. It should have beenmore clear that the toy would not run without a TMH. And it should have been clearly displayed with the twister.
3,I FEEL SLIGHTED,"Ok, a review for a BATTERY PACK?Im annoyed because I needed another battery, and I HAD to buy the charger again too.I feel cheated how many chargers do I need? Why wont they sell the battery sans charger?"
1,Rip Off!,"This toy and it's stupid battery ""pak"" are going back to Toys R Us. It's crazy that the ""pak"" and the toy are the same price (If you can find the ""pak""). NEVER buying Tyco ever again!!"
1,Price and Availability,"I bought the Tyco Rewinder Toy as a Christmas present for my grandson. Much to my dismay, the toy could not be used because I was unaware the rediculously priced battery pack was not available anywhere. Needless to say, the Tyco brand will not be considered in the future. There are hundeds of other customers in the Little Rock area that got sucked by this misleading sale and can probably be marked off as future customers of Tyco and Toys R Us. It turned out to be a Christmas bust.Ivan Gibbons"
1,Isaiah GBA Champ,SpongeBob Is Awful!! SpongeBob Is Worst Nicktoon Ever!! So You May Wanna Think Twice!!! About Getting this Game!!!!
2,"c'mon, spongebob...","i was really looking foward to playing this game, since the first three were great, but when i played it, it really SUCKED!first of all, the music was the same for every level, and you don't need to collect anything to beat the levels like in the 3rd one and 2nd. second, you just charge up, and dash through the enimes and the level! the bosses are easy, because you just have to jump on their heads three times. i suggest you go buy the first or second or third."
2,Street Atlas USA 2008,This software gets more difficult to use with the latest revision. I now find that tyhe triptickit on AAA is preferred.
2,GSP for my PDA,"I bought this software hoping that it would replate the outdated GPS software on my PDA. However, the product is weak and cannot really be used as a PDA gps system. Mapping on the PDA is weak. I have not used the software on my PC yet."
2,Not quite there,"The main reason I bought the Street Atlas in addition the Topo product was for trip planning and I the feature falls short. My main gripe is with the planning end of day stops.Street Atlas allows you to estimate your end of day point by hours or miles. But once you decide where to stop for the day, Street Atlas does not adjust the remainder of the trip, it stays with the original end of day points. Even for a trip of only a few days, the end of day points chosen by Street Atlas quickly become useless.Update 2/24/2008I'm taking away one point. I'm planning a trip down to the Florida Keys. I camp a lot and while the their topo software shows the campgrounds down there, this one doesn't. How bad can a trip planning product be when the non-trip planning product beats it in trip planning.I will not be buying anymore Delorme products."
1,Doesn't stay upright,"My 1 year old got this toy for his birthday in May and he would probably play with it if the toy wasn't so frustrating! The train will not stay upright for more than a few steps - carpet or floor it doesn't matter - the train will fall over on its side. Also, for the parents the sound can get VERY annoying in a short period of time. Even if your child loves Thomas, save your money and buy something else."
4,It has an on/off switch for the sound!,It has an on/off switch to shut off the sound. My son just loved pulling it all over.
1,Cute toy but it does tip over too easily,"I bought this toy for my nephew now almost 9 when he was almost 2. He liked it for awhile but it kept tipping over when pulled. It's a cute toy for a kid but it just that when you pull it, Annie and Clarabelle tend to tip easily and it's frustrating. I love the train noises it makes but the only problem is that it takes batteries. If I had my choice to buy a Thomas toy for a small child, the push and go Thomas is a better option. I bought that one for my nephew and he loved it. This toy, Save Your money and buy the PUSH and GO instead."
2,String isn't long enough and it tips over too easily,"This toy frustrates my two year old. He can't keep it properly balanced when he tries to pull it, and it often tips over. The string isn't very long (he can't stand and walk and pull). That just become frustrating when it is constantly tipping over. All the cars are connected, but loosely, so standing up the front car doesn't stand them all - you have to do each one which is too much for a toddler."
2,Tips over when turning,"My 2 and 1 yr. old love to play with this but they get frustrated. My kids don't always turn in a perfectly wide arc which is what this toy is designed for. Sometimes they'll make a sharp turn in the opposite direction. After turning around, the toy tips over. They fix it but when they turn again it tips again. I've had to teach my daughter to just expect the thing to tip and have a good attitude about it instead of getting frustrated and crying about it."
1,not pleased,Don't buy this toy unless you want to see you child very frustrated. It is not well ballanced and instead of taking this train for a chug around the house your little one will drag it (On it's side) behind them crying the hole time.
2,"A good idea, but...","This toy seemed like such a great idea. A train that my 16 month old son could really enjoy. However, I am tempted to hide it away in the closet. One problem is the noise. Everytime the cord is pulled, tugged, or moved, the train whistle goes off. Also, the cars are top-heavy and tip over easily when rounding corners. It is very frustrating for my son because the train persistently topples over. They could easily improve the toy by having the whistle go off when the wheels move (not when the pull string moves) and fix the cars so that they don't tip over."
4,This toy is one of the family favorites for many reasons.,"My 20 month old son loves to run aound the house pulling Thomas, Annie, & Clarabel. He enjoys banging the toy and himself in to furniture and walls and they are both going strong. He chooses to take it along for trips and even plays with it in his car seat. It is easy to pack and keep track of because it is all one piece. My husband and I thought the sound would drive us crazy, but our son gets such a kick out of it...it makes us laugh. Plus, it does have an on/off. My favorite part about this toy was my sons reaction when he first opened it. He could't believe his eyes and started yelling ""Oh Tommy, oh Tommy"". This toy keeps him busy and I like that."
3,Loves It,"This was the very first Thomas toy that we bought for my 2 year old. He now has several Thomas items and he still plays with it all the time (he even sleeps with it). The only bad part about it is that it is loud and annoying, but it does have an off switch to turn it off.Overall, I think it was a great investment."
4,"Fun toy, but loud","My 1 and 3 year old boys love Thomas and pull him everywhere. However, the ""chugging"" noise he makes becomes quite annoying, for adults, but can turn it on and off. If you can stand the noise, my boys love it."
4,slasher slasher,I actually saw this movie at a film festival in new york...It's set up as a regular b movie with the scares and the chills but there's a real twist that kept me guessing. I can't wait to see this movie in the comfort of my own home.... with the lights off.
2,I had to laugh!,"I guess the best part of this movie was getting to mock it through-out the entire thing! Wasn't the worst horror flick ever seen, but pretty close to it. Bored from the beginning. I must admit that I am glad I watched it just for the experience!"
2,"Cute sweater, but cheaply made","I bought four of these sweaters for my dogs; two red and two blue. They are dachshunds one is 8lbs (size small) and one is 14lbs (size medium.) The sizing is more for the length of the sweater than the circumference of their chest/belly.Pros+cute+rich color with contrasting arms and neck edge+has an opening on the back for a harnessCons-Poorly constructed (my medium sized dog's sweater ripped in the arm after the first use and no activity - she has a heart condition, physical activity is not even possible)-back leg straps - this may be a positive for some, but I prefer not to have the back straps, they always seem to get tangled in them-does not wash up nicely - material pilled even after being washed gently with WooliteI had two other of these sweaters on back-order, but I immediatly cancelled them as it was a waste of money. I would not recommend these sweaters."
3,Cute sweater,"Since this sweater is a knit, unfortunately it didn't last very long going in and out of the pet door. Got a snag that turned into a hole in just a few days. The fit was perfect and it's really soft, but doesn't hold up if your dog is very active."
1,"Nice Sweater, but terrible description",It would have been a great purchase if it actually fit. I measured my dog and ordered the appropriate size. This would fit a dog about 6 inches smaller than my dog.
4,Incredible,"After installing windows2000 on my sony vaio (against the manufacturer's suggestion), none of the capture software from sony would work. Not only that, sony would not support my computer even though they support a line of win2k programs. I began to search for an alternative capture solution, but no software supported sony's proprietary i.Link connection. Then i found MotoDV! Not only did it recognize my IEEE-1394 ports, it had all the drivers i needed for support in win2k, support that the original manufacturers wouldn't give! Very fast and stable, and provided excellent control of my camera during capture. Highly recommended for any video editor."
2,OK,"Sizes run way small the X large was like a small, bought as a gag gift and then I couldn't use it!"
1,WATCH OUT NOT a DVD-R product,"Be careful, I ordered this, and it came via Tiger Direct. It wasn't until I put it in that I realized it's /DVD+R/ so my laptop couldn't read it."
5,Breathtaking! The determination of a people once again!,"True life story - One the most faithful portrayals of Operation Thunderbolt, the celebrated rescue of Israeli citizens on an Air France Flight hijacked by PLO and German terrorist to Uganda, and the daring rescue by the Israeli armed forces."
4,"Victory at Entebbe, finally on DVD !","As a fan of oscar winner, Helen Hayes (Airport) and nominee LInda Blair (The Exorcist), I was thrilled when this all-star television movie from 1976 was finally released ! This story is based on a real life incident on July 4, 1976 when an Israeli commando force rescued 256 airline passengers held hostage by Arab and German terrorists at Entebbe Airport, Uganda. Originally shot on videotape in 1976 at Warner Bros. Studios, the transfer to DVD is clear and crisp with surprisingly vibrant color and great picture quality for a movie that is, now, 35 years old ! Great acting by Anthony Hopkins and Burt Lancaster as Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and Defense Minister Shimon Peres. This new DVD release is the original 3 hour version that was aired on ABC TV back in 1976 and not the 2 hour version that was released on videotape in 1995. I highly recommend this new version !"
3,Dueling Israelis,"There were two movies regarding the Entebbe raid. The first, ""Raid on Entebbe"" was a made-for-TV movie starring Charles Bronson. I knew there was another movie and found ""Victory at Entebbe"" starring Burt Lancaster and an all-star cast including Elizabeth Taylor! ""Victory"" was not as good as ""Raid."" In fact, it was pretty ""sappy."" The tecnical aspects weren't too bad, but the acting left a lot to be desired. If you can find either, I would go for ""Raid."""
2,"Very bad , like a cheap B movie!","Fortunately, I was able to view this video from the local library. I am glad I didn't buy it. I would rate it a 1 star but I didn't hate it, I just must say that it is a cheap movie. No documentation,very poor acting. I collect and look at Israel- Arab conflict material and this is not worth viewing. Don't be fooled by the list of actors. Try Assault On Entebbe."
4,long sleeve tees,these are really good buys.they fit really close to your everyday shopping buy.you dont have to size up or down when ordering.
3,Calificar,"Excelente producto, lo enviaron rápido y llego en muy bues estado. Es un producto de buena calidad, recomiendo al vendedor."
4,Just like Dame Edna,"The wig was perfect for the costume and the glasses just topped it off. There was some working on the wig and fluffing it up to get it to look just right, but when it did it was perfect!"
1,Disgusting!,"I remember growing up with my mom having this fragrance, everytime she wore it she made me want to gag. It's horridly strong and gives headaches and just flat out stinks! Sense of smell is a very different and particular thing, I know people who love this perfume, Though I hate it some who like ""kickers"" will love it."
1,"Must be a defect,very lite scent.",This was a gift for my mother at Christmas. She has been wearing this scent for over 20 years. We all smelled it after my mother said something was wrong. It's scent is so lite when my Mom puts it on it wears off right away. Soooo allot of money spent for nothing. I think they may be selling fakes or this could be a defect from EA the parent company
4,Red Door,"Red Door by Elizabeth Arden is my wife's favoraite perfume. She has used it for over twenty years and people are constantly complimenting her on its fragrance. Price is excellent compared to what I have found locally especially for the largest size. Will continue to purchase through Amazon until it prices itself out, hopefully that will not happen. I recommend you try the product."
5,Red Door eau de toilette,I ordered as a Christmas gift - delivery was fast - price was good - recipient was happy!
2,I closed the Red Door!,"Red Door puts Poison & Giorgio to shame. One spray will do or it will announce your arrival before you.It opens with honey-drenched white florals. Morphs into a rose, just a bit soapy, eventually a bit powdery. Takes a long time to dry down. Pleasant & wearable for me ... in about 2 hours.If you like extravagant florals, this one might be for you. I'm glad I opened the red door but I doubt that I'll do it again. I'm gonna keep this red door closed. However, I love this version:Red Door Velvet By Elizabeth Arden For Women, Eau De Parfum Spray, 3.3-Ounce Bottle"
2,NOT THE (OLD) RED DOOR!,"ARRIVED VERY QUICKLY AND IN A NICE 25TH ANNIVERSARY BOX. THIS IS MY FAVORITE PERFUME, BUT IT'S NOT THE SAME. I USED TO GET LOTS OF COMPLIMENTS WHEN EVER I WOULD WEAR IT. HOWEVER, WHEN I PUT IT ON, I FIND THE FRAGRANCE DIFFUSES QUICKLY AND DOES NOT SEEM TO HAVE THE SAME FLORAL NOTES. LIKE EVERYTHING ELSE COMPANY'S SEEM TO CUT COST. SORRY TO SAY, FOR ME IT'S TIME FOR A CHANGE :("
1,Not the genuine article :),"The fragrance stayed on for a second, and it was gone. I purchased 2.7oz previously, also eau de toilette, and that scent stayed on all day, literally. I got compliments all the time, and requests for its name, so I knew almost immediately that this was not genuine Red Door. I always purchase my fragrances directly from Amazon because I wanted to ensure that the products that I purchase are genuine, but I guess this one slipped thru the cracks. Amazon was great, however, regarding issuing a credit and this ""thing"" will go straight down the toilet where it belongs.I just wanted to be clear: Red Door as a fragrance, 5 stars; this bottle of yellow-colored water I received, I wish I could have given it zero stars, and I will add a STRONG recommendation to NOT buy."
4,Love This Cologne,"I have been using this fragrance for several years now and I love it. Red Door by Elizabeth Arden and White Diamonds by Elizabeth Taylor are my two favorite colognes. I have to disagree with the negative comment on this product. I don't feel that it is strong-scented at all. But of course with colognes and perfumes ""a little goes a long way."" Any cologne that is ""applied too liberally"" will be strong and overpowering in my opinion."
5,Fantastic Fragrance,"Red Door is my absolute favorite . Every time I wear it no matter where I go or whom I am around I constantly get compliments from men & women on how great I smell and they ask what I am wearing.Red Door makes me feel sexy, sensual, and confident. I would absolutely reccomend this to anyone who wants to smell wonderful!!!"
5,red door revue,"Very happy with this product!!!Wife has been using this scent for years, but it is often hard to find at a reasonable price.I was very pleased with the price and the delivery of the product, and am sure I will be reordering."
4,Great 24v charger,I have a small party bus business and we have some buses that have 24v systems. Just plug this bad boy in and they are good to go. I would recommend this in a heartbeat!!
2,Not as good as the Name,This is the third charger I have had to get in four years. Amazon has helped out with the exchange on one occasion but for a 24 volt charger my choices are limited. Does not hold up well near salt water conditions.
5,nice,I don't enjoy writing these 16 word minimumThis is the reason a lot of people don't give reviews.1 2 3 What more can I say
4,Works fine.,"Would like some more options/controls, but for the $$ this is a great unit and it does its job satisfactorily."
1,Worked great - ONCE - then died,"I just got my new charger in the mail last week. Hooked it up (correctly) to my 12vold Deep Cycle marine battery and it worked great. Charge indicator went to max (in the red) then was down to around 2% (as the manual said it would do) in a few hours. Next time I used it, a few days later. it never webt below 10% - and has remained there ever since. I tried it on my other 2 batteries - same thing. BTW, I use the deep cycle marine batteries for my 14' boat running two 12volt trolling motors.I haven't heard back from Amazon yet about a return / refund. We'll see.Maybe think about spending a little more and getting a better unit - I sure won't get another one of these."
4,Important Info for Average People Selecting Chargers,"First of all, a high quality 24V air-cooled charger like this is approx $132+ without S&H. I have Schumacher Chargers and they all operate very well for the price. The weak point on these chargers is ""whimpie"" wiring that is usually the cause of problems or alleged failures of the unit. If you are not ""technically inclined"" and have problems, ask a friend or acquaintance who can check the unit. The most common flaw, in my experience, is the connection near the alligator clips, since this area gets the most movement. A continuity check of the wiring can usually locate the fault. Also, since this unit does not have an on/off switch, I simply plug it into a power strip equipped with an on/off switch. A simple fix can save unnecessary replacement of a good unit. In my experience, Schumacher provides a cost effective product considering the price and the service."
4,NO REAL COMPLAINTS,"I have only used this charger a couple of times but so far, so good. I like the fact that you can set it on automatic and forget about it. I would have given it 5 stars if there was an off switch. Would be nicer than having to unplug it, which in time will probably damage the cord. Also, after I purchased it, a mechanical engineer told me that my batteries would last longer and would both get an equal charge by charging them on the 12 volt mode sepeately rather than connecting the charger in series to both batteries and charging them on the 24 volt setting. If that is true, I didn't need a 24 volt charger because I couldn't find a 24 volt baffery, only 2 - 12 volt batteries connected in series. I still like the unit, thus far."
3,OK but needs work on design for safety,"The charger works fine, but the wires from the charger to the clips gets very warm from being too small. My old Scumacher charger has much heavier wire and doesn't heat up. I changed the wires from the old one to the new one and the problem was solved. You cannot run that kind of amperage thru such small wires. That is basic electicity 101. Come on people. I would never dare to run this thing the way it was while I was away from home."
4,Nice little beast,"I have to say when I got this thing today, I had expected something about 1/2 its size. This thing is great lol. Shoots the little nerf darts out to 20 to 25 feet with great velocity and good arcing. There was one area I thought was alittle incorrect. The box that it comes in says you can sneak up on unsuspecting victims. LOL I would agree with that statement providing you are in a concert hall listening to a loud band or near a herd of Amish people building a barn. LOL. Otherwise the only people you will sneak up on will be deaf people. Aside from that realy minor detail this thing is great. I think it even has alittle personality as well. lol The grapler can move empty coke cans with ease. Ill know more when I start tormenting the little critters at my house."
5,awsome toy,"I first got mine at target.the rechargeable battery is the best one i have ever seen and used.i charged mine over night so i wouldn't have to wait.if you do that you will get a good full charge on it.As for the dart gun i think it is better than a nerf gun.if you hld down the trigger it will be an automatic gun.i lost a couple of the darts so i just substituted nerf darts for the real darts.i also like how you can adjust the height of the gun without even touching the nsect.the cool part is it can go in the grass or in the dirt. if you like quiet R/Cs than don't get this one, it is pretty loud. the claw thing in the front is ok.it is sometimes a little hard to grab stuff but it fine.the 2 main things i like about it is it can go inside or outside and it has a built-in dart gun.overall i recommend this toy."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"This was the one toy my son wanted from Santa - the centerpiece of his Christmas morning - and it doesn't work properly. The ""wings"" don't open fully to allow the missle launcher out, and the missles won't fire at all. A complete waste of money and huge disappointment to my son."
3,Defectife firing mechanism,"Same as others I purchased this NSECT over the holidays. Firing mechanism stop working shortly after my kid started to play with it.Instead of sending an advanced replacement Mattel had me waste my time dissasembling parts of the defective toy, sent them the parts AT MY OWN EXPENSE, and refused to send me the new toy until they received the defective one. Had to get mad and request to talk to a manager for them to finally agree to ship me the replacement when they were able to verify the defective was on the mail.For a fairly expensive toy very bad customer support. Very dissapointed kid over the holidays took like 10 days for Mattel to finally get the toy to my kid. Will never buy a complex toy from Mattel again.Eduardo"
2,Broke,"this toy was costly, and broke shortly after my child began to play with it. would not suggest you purchase this. look for something a little more sturdy. Boys!!"
2,Not that great,This toy will be played with maybe once or twice then sit in the back of the closet for the remainder. Not worth the money.
3,Not as cool as we expected.,This toy was not near as thrilling as we expected. Especially for the money we spent. My son has probably played with it 3 times since he got it 8 months ago. It already has trouble with the reverse motion on it.
4,Fun for the whole family!,"We bought this for our son (7), but the whole family (ages 5 to 80) have really had fun with it. It's movements are very ""life like"" for a robot, and the darts fly clear across the room. We have found a few glitches where it stops working exactly as it's suppose to, but turning it off and on has fixed those so far. Overall we'd recommend it - lots of fun."
3,frustrated mom,"Well, out of three, only one works. I had bought both of my boys each one for Christmas. The first two were from target. the blue one works well. It's really cool and no issues. The green one wouldn't fire the bullets so I returned it and ordered a new one from Amazon. The new green one came in and it doesn't work at all. Power goes to both the bug and remote but the remote will not work the bug. My poor son is begging for me to fix it. Meanwhile the two are fighting over the blue one, not to mention, now I have to figure out how to return it to amazon without it costing me any more money. Basically it's cool if it works but mattel may be shipping defective bugs just to meet the demand at Christmas time."
5,Stole the Show for Christmas,"This toy had my 10 year old amazed. It still does. He loves to have it run around the house and chase the dog, pick up things, and fire its missles. What a great toy. He can't wait for summer to take it outside and attempt to shoot it's nerf missles at the wildlife."
1,The Holy Spirit by Torrey,"Pretty hard to review a book when I have not recevied it as of this date, nor has anyone contacted me as to why? They were paid for but not received."
3,Widescreen?,"One of my favorites all time 50s horror movies. However a bit disapponted that it is presented in widescreen. The original movie was in full screen format. By giving us widescreen, a lot of the movie at the top and bottom of screen has been cropped off. Shame on Sony.."
3,Technically good; misses the spirit.; doesn't get Cuban beat,"I heard Pogoraro earlier this year at an all Lecuona recital at the U.N. in New York, as well as this recording. As a Cuban, I very much appreciate her championing the music of Lecuona, who is terribly underappreciated in ""serious"" music circles. BUT, unfortunately my Cuban friends and I feel she doesn't have a good grasp of the nuances of Cuban dance rhythms.When you have Lecuona himself available on recordings, why bother with anyone else. The Tirino series on the BIS label is worth getting for its comprehensiveness."
4,historical romance with focus on romance,"Louisa Elliott was a good historical romance with more of a focus on romance than history. The story focus is on the romance of an illegitimate woman, Louisa Elliott with a Royal Dragoon captain, Robert Duncannon. Louisa's cousin (also illegitimate) is secretly in love with Louisa as well.I enjoyed the characters, but I thought that Robert was the most richly drawn character. I thought that Louisa's cousin Edward wasn't very believable as a real person--seemed very flat. Louisa's choices through out the novel are not believable at times. Charlotte wasn't a very believable character, either. I also had a problem with the first cousins in love.I would have enjoyed more background information on the Royal Dragoons, and some of the military conflicts going on in the background becoming more of a focus of the story.I would recommend this to someone who enjoys historical romances, not historical fiction with a bit of romance."
3,Thanks Reviewers,"I like the songs that are on here, but I have to agree with the other reviewers. Why was 9 crimes left off? I heard it in the movie and LOVED it,so I got the soundtrack looking for it, but it wasn't there! Then I read the reviews and looked up 9 crimes, and it was the song I had heard and loved. Thanks fellow reviewers!"
3,Quick question about a song,I was just wondering if someone could help me identify the name of a song. What song intro is played (in harmonica) when right before Shrek and Artie's heart to heart chat by the campfire? It's the one merlin queues with his nightlight when he tries to set the mood. I think it's from the seventies. It plays at about 47:04. I would REALLY appreciate it if someone could get back to me. Thanks so muchSam
2,A disaster of Soundtrack... For such a funny and entertaining movie!,"How can you mix in one album, a new ""Barracuda"" version by Fergie, with Led Zeppelin's ""The Immigrant Song"" and McCartney+Wings superhit ""Live And Let Die""... In addition, with a weird version of Sly and The Family Stone's megahit ""Thank You (Falletin Be Mice Elf Agin)"", this time sung (?) by Eddie Murphy and Antonio Banderas???...Whew, this people in DreamWorks are great in making this animated series of movies about Shrek, an ogre that makes a continuous effort on being unpleasant to everyone, but with a certainly funny attitude... But in making soundtracks, DreamWorks music producers certainly made an OGRE one with this CD...!!!!"
1,For retro rockers.... only.,"These tracks may have worked as snippets in the movie, but in their entirety bereft of images, they're a bit tedious, unless of course you're Wayne;-)"
4,Not really a review...,"This isn't so much a new review as a correction of Amazon's Editorial Review. I just didn't know where else to put it.The original Shrek soundtrack did feature the song ""Hallelujah"", but it was not by Rufus Wainwright, rather the song was originally written by Leonard Cohen and the version on the soundtrack was a cover by John Cale (The Velvet Underground).As for this soundtrack, it's very good and the music was used quite well in the film."
1,No 9 Crimes?,"How could they publish this soundtrack without the most definitive song from the movie - ""9 Crimes"" from Damien Rice? Anyone who has seen the movie knows what I'm referring. Quite a shame - I wouldn't waste the money on this CD."
3,Good but a bit disappointed,"This is good overall. But, where is 9 crime as other people asking the same thing? It is not included!! I am a bit disappointed in that."
2,Shoulda used original Barracuda,"Soundtrack is okay, but I was disappointed they didn't just use the original version of Barracuda by Heart. Why a cover & why Fergie? Sorry, but she's not in the same league as Ann & Nancy Wilson."
2,Thanks to other reviewers,"This is not so much a review, but a message to the folks who compiled this soundtrack. After seeing the movie, the song I most wanted was the Damien Rice song 9 Crimes. Why on earth was it left off of the CD? I wouldn't have even known what the song was if it weren't for other reviewers, whom I would like to thank for the information about the song and for saving me the money. I will purchase the Damien Rice CD, but I will not purchase this soundtrack, at least not at full price. I'll wait until I find it in the cheap bin at the local record shop."
5,Really good album!,This is a wonderful album. I just cant stop listening to it. Defintely one of the years best and a must have.
3,too much of the same thing,"a few very strong tunes but all too similar in feel, tempo, and oftentimes in chord structure and melodic devices. strongest song is ""everything's changing""."
3,I found the album lacking,"I heard the single ""Everbody's changing"" and loved it. However, I guess I expected too much of the rest of the album. It is strange. The music is great. The lead singer has a beautiful voice, but the way that he uses it is terrible. I find myself waiting for a note at the end of a verse that never comes. The lyrics are just as bad. They are weak and not insightful. And sometimes the words just don't fit the tone of the song or the music. If I were you I would just record the single and save your time and money. Maybe this is just their immature freshman album, because it does seem like they have the potential to be good. I would just get a new lyricist."
5,"No Hope No Fear, 11 great songs.","Couple of songs are visited by the ghost of Brian Wilson...scary and stunningly beautiful..(Everybody's Changing , Sunshine )Saddest song ever written..(We Might As Well Be Strangers)This album is a dream. Only first grade songs. A candy store. Step inside. Now."
4,The Best Bargain CD To Close Out 2004,"I first heard ""Somewhere only we know"" on the radio and was wondering if Jeff Lynne of ELO had made a comeback. The DJ said the rest of the cd was equally good. I Listening to the rest of the cd, I found myelf comparing it to Ben Folds Five arrangements and AHA vocal ranges on ""This is the last time"". ""We might as well be strangers"" is a haunting song which echoed some feelings I once had. Overall a very relaxing cd and if you like Stephen Bishop you will be pleased..."
5,Love it!,"This CD has so many great songs, not your typical one or two hits. It's so worth it -- I'm looking forward to purchasing their other CDs!"
4,A Nice Change,"I hate comparing bands, but when I first heard Keane on the radio I considered them Coldplay's ""little brothers."" Now that I've listened to this disc a few times I have to admit their music has a softer, gentler quality, which is a nice change. That's the best I can do to describe it."
5,A Soaring Epic,"I bought ""Hopes and Fears"" almost a year ago after a friend recommended the album. He played ""Somewhere Only We Know"" and I was immediately hooked, and after listening to the whole album, I bought it the next day. I have to say that I still listen to the album over and over. While the piano composition is amazing, Tom Chaplin's vocals set Keane apart from other bands. Whether singing a quiet falsetto or belting his full tenor voice, I haven't heard a lead that can reach the high end of the register so clearly and effortlessly like Keane's frontman. And if great vocals aren't enough for you, Keane's soaring piano lines and epic melodies perfectly complement Chaplin's vocals. Highly recommended."
3,"Keane ""Hopes And Fears""","""Somewhere Only We Know"" 5/5""This Is The Last Time"" 4/5""Bend And Break"" 4/5""We Might As Well Be Strangers"" 3/5""Everybody's Changing"" 3/5""Your Eyes Open"" 3/5""She Has No Time"" 2/5""Can't Stop Now"" 4/5""Sunshine"" 3/5""Untitled 1"" 2/5""Bedshaped"" 3/5Keane's Brit-rock is similar to peers Radiohead and Coldplay but seems to rock a little bit more. There are, however, strong hints of melancholy elements here. Standout tracks include ""Somewhere Only We Know"" and ""Can't Stop Now.""Overall rating: Three stars."
2,In the Shadows of Giants,"Keane's new album is only trying to mimic those who have preceded them (Coldplay, Travis). They do not, as Rolling Stone puts it, ""[reconfigure] the high-romantic aesthetic introduced by Radiohead and mainstreamed by Coldplay as the launchpad for a serious hookfest."" Despite the two opening tracks, they fail to do anything that their predecessors do. They lack the depth and intrigue of these superior acts. Their tracks are all alike in their mediocrity and inane routineness. They fail to evoke the feeling and emotion that is necessary to fuel this genre of slow, reflective Britpop. This is why hopefully, following their undeserved hype, they will fade to obscurity...God willing."
1,Taco Bell Music,"People have said that you don't even notice that the guitar is gone and think that is a good thing. I just see it as another example of how mediocre this music truly is. If they had a guitar you would not notice if it was there. They play nothing interesting w/ their piano. Are they forever stuck w/ the same five keys? Their drumming is the saddest thing you could pull out of a drum machine. The singing and lyrics sound like the mutterings of the most bored nihilist I've ever heard. Ultimately, all the songs just run together with that same dry bored british whining, the repitive piano, and sorry drumming making me actually wish for the noisy and alteast distinct american whining of Nirvana."
2,"""Crazy; crazy for feeling so lonely""","Let's all chant together folks, ""Rip-off! Rip-off! Rip-off! Rip-off!""First of all, the cd is overpriced for an EP. This should've been about 3 or 4 dollars cheaper (or had more material on it to justify the price!).But the real injustice? These guys have recyled the work of the Zombies, and are trying to pass it off as ""ground-breaking,"" ""hip,"" and ""totally 21st Century"" - all phrases used directly by Mr. Chaplin to describe his band's music.I'm tired of these '60s-inspired bands - like Jet, the Hives, the White Stripes, and now Keane - essentially repackaging older (did someone say, ahem, better??) music and acting like today's kids are too dumb to notice. The smart ones aren't."
4,Beautiful music from the heart,"Hopes and fears is a solid album debut, bringing powerful and touching melodies with inspired lyrics that will transport you far, far away...The use of a piano instead of a guitar is a great choice, it helps a lot to rund the general concept of the music and it's a perfect match to Tom Chaplin's voice.Keane's music creates a rich atmospheric sensation that is present in every track of the album. My favorite pieces here are the emotive ""Somewhere only we know"" and the the haunting ""Sunshine"" (believe me, it can make you cry)Truly, a great album."
5,you need this CD,"After buying Keane's CD a week ago, I was so impressed I immediately began scrounging around for a ticket to their sold out concert at the Hammerstein Ballroom. Luckily I found one because the concert blew me away: Tom's voice filled the venue and hit every note perfectly while Tim pounded away energetically on the piano with even his legs getting into it. The show had so much energy and good vibes. I didn't want it to end. They also seemed genuinely appreciative of their fans. Everyone from young kids to adults in their 50s were enjoying the music - they definitely have cross-generational appeal. This is money well spent and a great band to support. Try to see Keane live but buy the CD first because you'll want to sing along to all of their songs!"
4,Really like it,"I got this CD mainly for ""Somewhere Only We Know"" after hearing Blake Lewis sing it. But I like other songs on this cd too. Band is different than anything here in the US, and I like their way of singing and playing music. I have to say, I like the cd that they made after this one, even better."
4,Awesome,"It seems everyone is a critic when it comes to music, but this is an awesome CD...and a great band. You would think the cd was $12000 instead of $12, based on the critiques. Like most people, I have hundreds of cd's, and this is a great addition to my collection."
3,I Changed My Review to 4 Stars!,"I originally gave this Cd only 3 stars but I would now like to add one more star. This Cd grew on me. One night while driving to my boyfriend's house I developed a killer headache. I popped in Keane as it was the only Cd within reach that could be somewhat soothing to my aching head. From that point on, I grew to really like the Cd. Great to sing along to in the car on long trips. Very beautiful music, very soothing and I like the inclusion of the electronic blips on some of the songs. I still feel that some of the songs sound a bit too ""inspirational"" or ""power ballady"" so if I am stopped in traffic with the windows down I tend to lower the volume on these few songs. I would say give this Cd a chance and it may grow on you as it did me. 9 out of 10 headache sufferers agree!"
3,Queen meets Coldplay meets Five for Fighting,It really grows on you after a while. A very good freshman effort!
1,Hopes and Fears: A Beautiful and Original Masterpiece,"Just kidding, you tools. While everyone currently sucking at the teat of the record industry fights over whether Coldplay or Keane is more beautiful and emotional, music fans with more discriminating tastes are standing to the side, laughing. If you enjoy pretentious music with affected emotion, please $upport Keane, Coldplay, etc.Suggested alternatives to this drivel: The Band, The Beatles, Bob Dylan, (Early) David Bowie, Guided By Voices, maybe even Radiohead."
1,Uninspired rubbish!,Between Keane and Nickelback I'd take Keane.No doubt about it.My only advice to people who claim it's one of the best blablabla ever - listen to more records.And some more records.Then there's hope for all of us.
2,the most sensetive and stupid band on earth,"Keane is stupid.Indi stars should care about their appearance, not just how well they play. And can you believe it? Keane doesn't have a guitar!!!! I think Keane is the grossest, most stupid and sensetive band on the planet."
5,Buy this for the long road trip,"This collection is from Tim Rice, excellent and authentic!!<br />Very calming and creative fun! This is music with a message! If you are stressed, pop this in and relax, you'll be singing along with this one...I first heard this in England summer of '04...yes, they've been out for awhile but are trying to break the USA...I believe they have it put altogether!! Worth every cent...Also,you'll want to try Robbie Williams Greatest Hits and Ronan Keating 10 years of hits, both from the UK..both worth listening..This music is not to be missed!! BUY THEM!!!"
1,Not so great,"I am disappointed in this CD. I had seen a couple of Keane videos, and they were ok, but the CD isn't so great."
4,Good Stuff- Cheers,This is a really great album thats a pleasure to listen to. I can't really fault any of the songs but the only thing I have a gripe about is that there isn't much variety in the song styles. The main theme is piano through most of the tracks. The vocals are very well done as well. All in all just go buy it... after you listen to a few of the songs. If you like what you hear go for it if not please don't insult everyone else that does in your review of it. Your opinion isn't the ultimate truth of reality just because it comes from you. Anyways I enjoyed it and I hope you do too. If not go find music to your taste.Cheers
5,Hopes and Fears,"An amazingly beautiful album. The vocals, the piano work, eveything makes the album very warm and beutiful. Great for just sitting back and relaxing, whether it's because if a hard day, or just ending a great night with song.Truly a band to keep an ear out for. Only problem is, it just seems not enough. I am very anxious in hearing more from them. Something everyone should have."
5,Amazing.,"The first time I heard of Keane, their new album Perfect Symmetry was featured on NPR. I picked up that album and I love it - rated it a 5 here on Amazon. However, P.S. is rated relatively poorly and at first I couldn't really understand why, since it's fun, poppy, energetic, and very enjoyable. After getting Hopes and Fears and listening through this, I get it. If people had gotten to know Keane as a band that put out music of this depth, beauty, and complexity, Perfect Symmetry would be a let down.Every few days a new track surfaces as my current favorite... I know I'm just throwing my voice to the chorus of praises here, but this album is brilliant."
3,it's ok,"this album is good for reading, doing taxes, laundry, driving with a full load of people in the car at low volume, and taking a bath.honestly, anyone could but an album like this together. there isn't anything new or special. however, i do love melodic stuff. if you like melodic stuff, then this is a good album for you. but do yourself a favor and listen to Oasis first."
2,"Fine but boring, not quite Coldplay...","I love Coldplay (and lots of British pop) with a passion - and followed friends' advice to check out this album. However, I was disappointed with it. Not one song really stuck out or spoke to me, and the lead singer's voice doesn't hold a candle to the warm, clear, rousing quality of Chris Martin's voice. The album has some nice melodies and moments, but *yawn* I think I'll eventually give this CD away to someone else."
2,"Eh, it's ok.","""Somewhere only we know"" is the best song by far and the only one worth buying. It a great song and sounds just like Travis. I thought it was Travis when I heard it. And I had seen Keane on SNL previously. They werne't too good on there. Voice cracking and all. I don't get the comparisons to Coldplay. They sound nothing alike aside from the use of a piano. I wouldn't recommend buying the whole album. Just buy the one song off iTunes. The rest of the album is really cheesy. Don't waste your money."
4,Good debut but a debut it is....,"Good debut! I like this cd much more than I expected. Definitely very compatible with COLDPLAY and RADIOHEAD style. I am especially taken by the later tracks - ""Untitled 1"" and ""Bedshaped"" - which emulate experienced fellow-UK band MARILLION (in fact, I strongly recommend MARILLION cd's ""Marbles"" or ""Afraid of Sunlight""). I look to be impressed by KEANE along these lines of greater maturity and depth in sound and style in their future material. This is a good start and they certainly have my attention."
4,Keane delivers an EPIC debut!,"I'm a 19-year-old Black guy listening to Keane. Unlikely, by most people's standards, however, that alone should encourage anyone to give ""Hopes and Fears"" a listen. It's one of the most amazing debuts in Pop music within that last 10 years! Please pick up this CD, because you will play it constantly and it's great mood music. Cloudy day? Put on Keane. Rainy day? Put on Keane. Making love? You get the idea. By no means, however, get the idea that this is the only thing this CD is good for. It's simply great melodic pop music.Favorite tracks: 'Somewhere Only We Know' 'We Might As Well Be Starngers' 'Everybody's Changing'"
1,Where are the extra tracks?,Keane is my most favorite band. I bought this CD thinking that there were extra tracks on it but there aren't any. It's exactly the same as the US release version. This was a disappointment to say the least.
4,Laid back flow,"You can argue all day about who Keane sounds like, but at the end of the day it's easiest to just listen to their songs and judge for yourself. I first heard Keane by watching a broadcast of their performance at this year's Glastonbury Festival on BBC 1. I was impressed by the strong, clear vocals over smooth yet upbeat melodies and quickly picked up their cd. My personal favorites are 'This Is The Last Time' and 'Everybody's Changing'. Overall, it's a good cd, but it's not out to change the world."
4,Soothing cd,"This album is soothing and has a certain chill out factor one needs from time to time. Apparently, they are a part of a Britpop rebirth. However, the version of Britpop is up for debate. I think it is close to Coldplay, Flannelmouth and Radiohead. I can certainly recommend this album if it is the chill out factor you are looking for. Listen to the clips and you will know what I mean."
5,Very Promising,"This band just might survive the new wave of Brit-rock-pop-alt that has emerged recently. I don't think comparing them to their compatriots like Coldplay, Travis and the like does them any justice. Their songs and sound stand alone as one of the best bands of the last year, hands down."
5,Can't get it out of my CD player....,"This is my first ever recommendation on Amazon so that should say something that I am going out of my way to recommend Keane's ""Hopes and Fears"". Sure they are being compared to Coldplay but I think that is mostly because they both use the piano as a main instrument. In my opinion, Keane's songs and melodies are better than Coldplay and I really enjoy Coldplay. Tom Chaplin's vocals are reminiscent (at times) of Freddie Mercury. I also hear an influence of ABBA but don't let that scare you away if you don't like ABBA. In any case, as I stated in the title, I have tried to get this CD out of my car but somehow, it continues to ""stay in the rotation"" while other CD's head back in the house."
3,Nice...(3.5 stars),"If you need an album to mellow out to, something to just kick back and flow with, this is the one. Although I usually prefer music with Electric Guitars and harder melody, Keane captivated me with their lyrical delivery and killer vocals. Get it today..."
5,A real winner,"While the stripped down approach (voice, piano, bass, drums) may not capture everyone's taste, this is a superb CD. The production is first rate.The eleven tracks really lack any filler stuff. My favorite is definitely ""This is the Last Time"". I really enjoy the slower tracks, ""She has No Time"" and ""We Might As Well Be Strangers"". Of course, ""Somewhere Only We Know"" and ""Everybody's Changing"" and ""Can't Stop Now"" are top notch.I have to admit I was a little skeptical of the Keane mystique when I read about them in Q magazine, but I'm really glad I bought this CD. I find myself listening to it all the time."
3,A BAND WITH NO GUITARS? IS THAT POSSIBLE?,"woah, when I first heard of Keane I thought it was impossible. But I checked them out and I bought their CD and they were playing with velvet revolver. Well they are pretty good, they're not horrible. but, it gets pretty boring after awhile. And I hand't picked up and listened to their CD in forever, and the only time I listen to their CDs is when I'm trying to sleep and want to fall asleep really fast but all the other times I keep it safe in its case. Because no matter how good they are they're still not as good as any other band with guitars but I support the whole idea of being different."
2,SAVE YOUR MONEY,"IF YOU THINK THAT YOU ARE GOING TO GET SOMETHING OUT OF THE ORDINARY WITH THIS DISK YOU ARE SADLY MISTAKEN, THERE ARE A FEW NICE DUNKS, HARDLY ANY HANDLE THAT IS WORTH SEEING, AND ON TOP OF ALL THAT ALL THE DISK SEEMS TO DO IS TO GET IN TO THE HEADS OF THE ALLSTARS IF THAT IS WHAT THEY ARE, THE HIGHLIGHTS ARE SHORT AND NOT UP TO MUCH, ALLSTAR DISK , DONT EXPECT ALLSTAR ENTERTAINMENT, PUT THE POPCORN AWAY AND GET YOUR PILLOW OUT, THIS ONE WILL PUT YOU TO SLEEP, MY ADVICE BUY BALL ABOVE ALL ATLEAST THAT HAS SOME ACTION IN IT FAILING THAT THE MJ ULTIMATE IS THE BASKETBALLERS BEST FRIEND.DO NOT BE FOOLED BY THE WRITE UP ON THE BACK OF THE COVER, FOR CRYING OUT LOUD, ITS A CRIME TO BE THIS MUCH MISLEAD AND ROBBED AT THE PRICE, A GUTTED CUSTOMER"
2,Not much use,I bought this as a gift. They never used it. It may be a great product but it didn't go over very well as a gift.
3,"Kelly James-Enger, Energetic Lady w/ Funny Perspective","This book reminded me of living in Downtown Chicago, after college, mid. 20 and struggling with men, career and family identity. Kelly James-Enger's characters helped me come to a resolution and closer, regarding a longtime friendship that has come to an end."
2,"Works great BUT,","This fan worked great after I got it installed properly But, it is a little louder than the original and I had to drill and tap the housing to install the condensation drain in it because it was turned wrong for the drain they provided."
5,The Very Entertaining Dame Edna !,Hilarity ensues when Edna has a show. Particular favorite was Dusty Springfield and the repartee between the two Divas. Fans will love this. If you need a laugh this is the DVD for you.
1,Unhappy customer,The DVD we received was in such bad condition we could not watch it.Can not find the address to return it to and Mich2Miles will not respondto my emails asking for the return address. Will not buy from themagain. Enjoyed what we could see of Dame Edna.
3,Into The Woods...where's all the music???,I can't believe The Last Midnight and Moment in the Woods aren't in this book...the two biggest female solos in the show!!!
3,Lesser Sondheim Makes an Interesting Vocal Selection.,"This is definetly not my favorite Sondheim show. It tends to repeat it self too much, and the music becomes long in the tooth after a while. However, for the vocal selection, they picked some wonderful highlights.Titles include: INTO THE WOODS, AGONY, IT TAKES TWO, STAY WITH ME, ANY MOMENT, NO MORE, and NO ONE IS ALONE. The reductions make it simpler to play. In fact, I find it the easiest of Sondheim's scores to play. Not to say that a beginner could pick it up and play it, but an intermediate player probaly would find it enjoyable.Some people bemoan the fact that ""Children Will Listen"", and ""Giants in the sky"" are not included here. ""Children will Listen"" is published seperately, and ""Giants..."" is included in ""All Sondheim Vol. 4"". That is if you absolutely want to have those two songs, otherwise it becomes a tad bit costly.If you enjoy this musical, the vocal selection seems a good place to start to understand this popular score."
5,An essential guide to developing emotional intelligence,"There are many books on emotional intelligence. What makes this book distinct is that it contains a model for developing emotional intelligence.As much as I have already read on the topic, Adele's self-coaching model has helped me develop a much greater awareness of myself and ways in which I can improve in the development of the competencies associated with emotional intelligence.This book is absolutely essential reading for people engaged in consulting and management development. I have made this required reading in my work as an executive coach. Her work has had such an impact on me personally that I do not hesitate to ask my clients to read it."
5,The EQ Difference,"The EQ Difference is pragmatic and full of real-life examples that help the reader understand the importance of EI for our success as leaders in every field. As an educational leader with 27 years experience, I highly recommend this book to all those who aspire to be great leaders and those who are invovled in developing future leaders in education. If you want your values and intentions to align with what you do each day, read and use this book! If you want to know if your EQ is as important as your IQ read this book!"
5,Professional Review from a Beginning Leader,"This is an excellent book for young professionals who are interested in becoming strong leaders. The material gave me very good insights in how to mentally handle situations that dealt with difficult interactions within the workplace. There were very good examples. It was very easy reading. All good leaders must be open to input in order to grow. The material discussed in this book, will help you grow as leaders, and can easily be applied in the work place. It is a ""must have"" book in your personal refernece libraries."
5,A life changing book,"Everyone should read this book. You'll be astounded at how ""on autopilot"" we live our lives. I'd recommend this book to anyone that is wanting to break out of the ""robotic shell"" and want to truly start living life."
4,Acoustic Rcok,"This is a great Sig licks DVD for acoustic rock riffing...walks you through the riffs, bringing some of the best to the DVD."
1,Won't ever be buying a Memorex product again.,"After many attempts trying to burn or try to format the blu-ray RE it would not burn and repeated gave me failed messages. Called customer service, they told me my drivers were probably not updated. Checked and they were. Called them back and they want me to send it back first on my own dime for their defective product. Not happy with that as it is more trouble and money than it was worth. Really unhappy with the defective product and the time & money wasting hoop jumping that I have to go through to get my money back. Terrible customer experience. Our household will not be purchasing Memorex products again. Reminds me of the days when I'd buy a pack of blank Memorex CD's and 40% of them would end up in the trash because they don't burn properly. Cheap product, cheap customer service policy. Buyers beware, don't look for any help if you get a defective product from them."
1,BD-RE does not work,"Recently purchased this media for an LG Blu-Ray burner. Disk does not burn, erase, or anything. Sounds exactly like the same sort of problem as the other reviewer described. Bought a Panasonic disk and it works perfectly. Tried to access the Memorex website for warranty service as the packaging instructs and there is no warranty service link; only a support section that attempts to answer questions. I'd advise you to stay away from this media."
4,Mommy of a Toddler,"My son absolutely loves his new comforter/sheet set. He's all about trains right now and for the first week of trying to get him to sleep was a little difficult because he kept saying ""choo-choo."" The only negative part about the entire set is that the fitted sheet does not stay on too well. It doesn't seem to hug the mattress tight enough. Other than that, he loves it."
5,My son loves it,This is an excellent high quality bed set for my son. He was so excited to get his new bed and he loves this bedspread! I have washed the sheets and the bedspread multiple times and they are holding up beautifully. One of the things that I really like about this set is the colors are so bright and it really brightens up his room. I also got the wallpaper cutouts and am pasting them on a stool that I bought at Target so he can easily get up on the bed by himself. For his birthday I am getting him one of those road rugs that will go perfectly with the theme. I highly recommend this bed set.
1,Fabric has changed- too rough,"I bought 2 sets of these sheets for my son about 7 years ago and they were nice and soft and have held up good. They washed and dried nicely, not wrinkled. I decided to buy one extra set since his have become stained after 7 years. The material must have changed. The material is now very rough and scratchy. It comes out of the dryer very wrinkled. I am very disappointed in this new set. I need to buy another new set of sheets for his bed. It will probably not be from Olive Kids if this is the type of material they are not using."
2,OK,"Ordered these after reading the reviews. Nice colors, but the tops of the flat sheet and pillow cases need to be ironed. If not, they look like they've spent a week balled up in a suitcase."
1,SAND PAPER SHEETS,"I would give these sheets zero stars if I could. They are TERRIBLE. They didnt feel so bad when I took them out of the package but when I took them out of the dryer after washing them, I was immediatly put off. They were a WRINKLED MESS. I had to put them on my son's bed as we had just gotten his bed that day and I had no other twin size sheets. I layed in them and they gave me the chills. These are the most uncomfortable, sand paper like sheets I have ever felt in my life. Don't buy these unless you really dont care about your child's comfort. They have some set charging $40 for these sheets! I just bought him 400 thread count sheets at Bed Bath and Beyond for $30!! Save your money."
2,Poor quality and rough,"These sheets are adorable, but I am returning them for the following reasons: the stitching around the edges is already coming loose after 3 washes and they are very rough. I washed these sheets 3 times using fabric softener and a dryer sheet and they are still very rough for my 19 month old's skin. I was hesitant to buy these based on other reviews with similar opinions, but I loved the pattern and hoped for the best. Off to find new sheets I guess! Won't be buying anything else from Olive Kids, hoping to find a cute fun pattern, but we may have to settle for a more adult sheet if we want the softness like the ones that we have on our bed."
3,"cute, but not high quality","The pattern was very cute and exactly what I was looking for, but for the price, I wasn't at all impressed by the quality. They wrinkle easily and are not very soft. The elastic is only at the top & bottom of the fitted sheet, rather than all the way around, which would have made for a much better fit.I'm mildly bothered by the upside-down pattern on the top sheet, and the designers could've easily fixed that by alternating the direction of the pattern."
3,Cute but not the best quality...,"My son is obsessed with trains! I wanted to get him some fun sheets for his new ""big-boy bed"" but I wasn't really into the giant Thomas face on the Tank Engine bedding sets. I found this set and thought it was super-cute so we put it on his wishlist and it was gifted to us. It certainly is cute, just like in the pictures, but for the price of the Olive Kids brand I expected better quality and find myself to be pretty disappointed. The sheets are just not real soft; pretty stiff and rough actually (even after laundering). Thicker than the generic Target or Wal-Mart brands, but not a line of bedding I would ever consider purchasing for my self. -Especially considering that high price tag. I think I'll have to hold out for the sales at The Pottery Barn from now on. Now those are awesome sheets!"
3,Falling apart in less than a year,"Our son likes his sheet set and matching comforter (fits the mattress well and I don't have to wrestle with it to get it on), but unfortunately after about 7-8 months of use and washing (washing every other week or so) it's starting to come apart at the seams. Pillow case, flat sheet and comforter are the ones coming apart so far. It's only going to unravel more the more we wash it). So for the price we paid I'd say not good enough quality. Also, it isn't that soft but our son didn't complain that it was scratchy."
1,Not as pictured,"I purchased this item to match the exisiting sheets of my older son as my two boys will be sharing a room. My young son just went into big boy bed so i washed the sheets. To my dismay, the sheets do not have the blue checked trim on pillow case and top sheet. Colors are also duller. I missed the return window. So disappointed. Wish i would have checked before washing, but had no reason to think it would be different than pictured. As a frequent amazon buyer, i will now be much more cautiopus purchasing from them."
5,Conversation,"I bought this so my husband and I could have more conversations and get to know eachother better. My husband feels its brings good topics that arent talked about on a daily basis.... he feels it takes the stress about talking about serious topics out of it by making it fun. I love that it asks questions I would like to know but haven't asked because sometimes it's easier to answer a third party question then a direct question so no one takes everything so personal that they end up arguing. We haven't been through the whole stack but we both feel like it's helping our relationship. As long as one goes through the questions with an open mind and is willing to be serious about their answers and be REAL with their partner, it's great. The topics actually roll in to other conversations which I feel is worth the money. I'm glad I bought it."
5,So Much Fun!,"My husband and I LOVE these cards! We have a toddler and don't get out for fun very often, but we had a better time sitting on the couch and reading these questions and discussing our answers than we could have leaving the house. We're planning to get the family set to include our teenagers and twenty-somethings, too!"
3,Not What I'd Hoped For,"I bought Table Topics because some friends brought it to a girls' retreat last year, and I loved the discussions it jumpstarted, so I purchased one for couples, as well. I was disappointed by many of the questions, as they didn't pertain to typical couples I know. I would like more creative questions that would intrigue and spark imagination. But I was able to use some of them. If I have a party, I'll probably write my own questions."
4,Conversation Starter,"Fun cards that start conversation. However, some topics are dead end starters only requiring single responses to complete the answer."
3,A Bit Confrontational,"I got these cards because my husband had mentioned in passing that it would be great if they made cards suggesting topics to discuss while at dinner. As a married couple with two young kids, we thought it would be a great thing to keep us from constantly talking about the kids or blankly staring at each other across the table. Unfortunately, too many of the ""conversation starters"" turned out to be WAY too uncomfortable. For example, ""Have you ever cheated on a lover?"" and ""What's the worst mistake you ever made in a relationship?"" or ""Which sexual activity would you like to try if there were no negative consequences?""... these cards often bring up PAST relationships, or, like the last question, pose a question that touts no consequences, when in reality, the answer itself is likely charged with consequences. The cards are a great idea, but the questions should be more interesting, rather than biting."
4,not for newly dating couples,"this is designed for serious couples that are in well-established relationships or are married. i thought this would be a fun way to get to know my NEW boyfriend better. i sorted through the cards and would only be comfortable using about 1/3 of the cards in such a new relationship...otherwise, i just might scare him off asking questions about marriage and children. :)"
5,Great for parties or everyday,This is a great product to help keep the lines of communication open between couples. It is also great for when you are entertaining friends to spark conversations.
2,"Men, stay away!!","Don't let your spouse/girlfriend convenience you this is a healthy and fun game to build your relationship. It will only spur topics that lead into heated discussions. I have never finished a one-on-one Q: and A: that has left me feeling I have bonded in some way with the other. You would be better off spending $200 on a marriage counselor, that way you will have a referee in this game you will otherwise LOSS at!"
5,couples table topics,"I got two sets of this game, one for me and my husband and one as a bridal shower gift. The cards are packaged really nice in a clear acrylic box and are printed up really nice. Me and my husband have been having fun asking each other the questions. Some are light and easy and some really make you think. It is a great way to get to know your partner even better."
5,We love this!!!,"This product is amazing!!!! My boyfriend and I talk to each other ALL THE TIME, and these cards got us talking about things we never talked about before! It is so much fun and we really enjoy it!! Although I can see how some of the cards would start heated arguments, so maybe just pre-read them if you're worried??? All in all this was a GREAT product. Thank you!!"
4,Great for any couple!,"Great cards to use if you would like to communicate more with your significant other. The questions are all appropriate, and do not cross the line. It created some great sharing moments."
5,bushwacker fender flares,"excellent product, they took paint & installed very nice & easy with all factory holes. Need to protect front edge of rear flare from rock chips from front tires is the only problem with this wide of a flare,have not found a mud flap that looks good on these flares"
4,Not as bad as a root canal,"I'm not a finance person nor do I plan to be one in the future. Will working in sales for the past 10 years I have become more aware of what I don't know and finance is surely one of those areas. This book covers the basic's of the financial world without putting you into a comma. The homework at the end of each chapter gets to be a bit of a pain since I was looking for the ""concept"" not trying to become an accountant. The best part of the book is it starts basic and builds off of that throughout the book which helped me understand some of the more complex financial terms. Good book for someone trying to get up to speed quick."
4,A good start,"Very helpful for the student thinking of pursuing a degree in finance. If you have no finance or business experience, this is a good place to start."
5,Good practical book,The best of this book is how accounting and management are described. Very practical and useful.The author send you the certificate as promised.
3,Oliver - 'Good Morning Starshine:The Best Of Oliver' (Taragon) 3 1/2 stars,"I barely remember much about this 'vocal pop' artist. Born as William Oliver Swafford, 1945-2000. He passed on from cancer at the age of 54. This is a twelve track collection of his better material. Looks like he had three albums put out. What I do recall is his 1970 hit ""Good Morning,Starshine"". Other tunes on this CD worth mentioning are ""Sunday Morning"", ""I Can Remember"", his Gordon Lightfoot song ""Early Morning Rain"" and Dylan's cover of ""Walkin' Down The Line"". A nice easy listening pick."
4,GOOD MORNING STAR SHINE,I have always loved that song and another on here called JEAN JEAN. It is old but I like it so much. I looked for it for so long and finally found it.
3,Can't compare to his album titled Good Morning Starshine,"I first discovered Oliver in early 1970 with the album Good Morning Starshine. It included Jean and Good Morning Starshine, but also other wonderfsul songs, inlcuding Both Sides Now, In my Life, Who will Buy, Where is Love and Ruby Tuesday. Now that is the album that should have been made into a CD. Until it does I will be just have to be happy with my old 33 1/# album."
1,Mine lasted 18 months!,"This tv was great until it broke. Recently, the tv would occasionally not get a picture when I would turn it on. Sometimes it worked, sometimes it didn't (sound was fine). Well tonight in the middle of watching it, we lost the picture and started to get a loud high pitched screech. I had to unplug it to get it to stop. I tried plugging it back in a couple of times, and the high pitch sound (and black screen) is still there.This is the last RCA I will ever buy."
1,Who made this excrement?,I'm going to keep this review short:1. Horrible acting2. Stupid script3. Subpar photography4. Unoriginal plot5. Waste of timeConclusion: Don't rent or buy this insult to the horror genre.
2,amazon purchse for kindle,I was looking for a different author also by the name of Joel Rosenberg. This is not a book I will read.
4,"A new and interesting take on that fantasy ""otherworld""","Rosenberg does an excellent job wafting us right into his interesting ""otherworld"" where fertility godesses live in their retirement and Odin runs a ferry. He identifies a little too much with Ian, I think, and spends just a little too much time on small details, but then again the details add to the richness of the setting, so long as they don't bog you down. All in all, an excellent read, and I'm looking forward to the rest of the books in the series. I hope he can keep up the freshness of the ideas and vitality of the characters better in this series than he did in Guardians of the Flame."
5,This is a fun book!,"Being of fan of Rosenberg for some time, I was impressed bythis latests offering. It is a well crafted book that takes the oldcliche of real world people being thrusted into a fantasy world and adds a lot of surprises! The characters felt real and three-dimensional. I have to agree with the eariler comment about Ian Silverstein because he was a really well developed, interesting character. Looking forward to the second book The Silver Stone."
1,Amarjay,"I bought this book by mistake thinking the author was Joel ""C"" Rosenberg. However, I did attempt to read it and was not impressed. The idea of wolf/men coming out of the ground and they could not be killed with bullets was just too bizzare for me. Since I did not finish the book, I can't tell you much more about it."
3,The Fire Duke Joel Rosenburg,Brought this series because of the book that was writtin with Raymond feist ( Riftwar . Murder IN LAMUT )I have found it takes quite a while for the story to build not quite what I enjoy but still is good reading ( I guess being a Feist Fan it take a little to get used to other writesThe Fire Duke (Keepers of the Hidden Ways)The Fire Duke: Keepers of the Hidden Ways Book One.).
4,Very exciting,"I have really enjoyed this book -- however, I have been surprised at the language. Actually, disappointed! It will not keep me from reading the other two books in the series but I won't be able to recommend them."
3,Put me deep into trance but didn't help me lose,"I have really mixed feelings about this set. It puts me very deep into hypnosis, I love the stories, in fact I love everything about this set except for one thing, and this is crucial: It didn't seem to have any effect on my ability to lose weight and I listened 2 to 3 times a day for more than a month"
3,A message with which I agree wrought tedious,"The book is a series of articles, apparently selected by Bork, inveighing against the imperial judiciary. A position with which I am in complete agreement. But, like working the candy store, after a few delicious treats, all the sweets start to taste the same. After reading a few of the pieces I concluded that there were none to the contrary, so there was little need to read further.The blight of judicial overreach is not a uniquely American phenomenon--it is pandemic. But it can also be a blessing, as the Rule of Law is applied to a government otherwise unconstrained. I saw no evidence of this in the few pieces I read.So, like the new hire in the candy store, I have had my fill of stuff that I liked, and am now looking for something a bit tarter--something that will make me think."
4,Girly Girl Rock,"What can I say, it is very girlie and somewhat young. I previewed these songs before making the purchase. I liked the vocals, but for some reason the quality of sound seems different then my other purchased CD's; kind of on the tinty side. There are a few rock ballads (which is what I enjoy), but this is not all rock n roll. I ignored one review saying that they purchased this for a young teen girl. Yep, it certainly seems suitable for a young teen girl or pre-teen. I like it, but maybe I would have purchased something different. I also purchased this for a friend (before checking out); she said she is enjoying it. Dare I state our ages...nope...okay...no...more than any teen doubled. :-)"
4,Another Journal Entry,"It is kind of girlee, that's why I chose it for my niece, who is a teen, but I bought one for myself as well, because there are some cool tracks in it, such as the acoustic version of ""I need you to love me."" It is quite fresh and innovative, while at the same time being kind of sophomoric. It is good as far as its spiritual content."
5,Barlow Girl on top of their game!,"The female trio sister group called ""Barlow Girl"" has done it again with another fantastic album that will probably appeal to most teenage girls, but may also appeal to the boys (they are beautiful, after all). The lyrics are clean, but deep; and the music style is very modern and will capture the attention of its listeners. Great job by Barlow Girl and I recommend adding this one to your collection!!!"
4,"Great Sound, Great Lyrics","Another Journal Entry is another quality CD by BarlowGirl. It combines good rock and roll with solid, positive lyrics. The lead singer has a very beautiful voice.There are several very good songs on here. Some of my favorites are as follows: Grey, Let Go, I Need You To Love Me, and Never Alone.This group combines some very good attributes: positive, inspirational lyrics that parents will appreciate with energetic rock that will appeal to teenagers. Actually, their appeal is far broader than just teens. This is good stuff for anyone.If you are looking for something to buy for a teenage girl especially, I highly recommend BarlowGirl."
4,"They Are Women, Hear Them Rock","Casual fans of Barlow Girl may be familiar with their powerful and loving ballads such as ""Enough"" and ""I Need You To Love Me,"" but purchasing this album will let you in on a big secret: These ladies know how to rock. With the opening cut, ""Grey,"" new fans will realize that the solid lyric and music stylings of the Girls' CCM light hits transitions perfectly into their rock songs. This carries on into songs like ""Let Go"" and and even pop rockers like ""5 Minutes Of Fame.""If you like Christian bands like Superchic(k) or music along the lines of Kelly Clarkson's album ""Breakaway"" (but more moving and definitely more rockin'), check out Barlow Girl's ""Another Journal Entry). They have a couple of other albums out as well, and they are also worth a look.Highly recommended."
5,BarlowGirl- Another Journal Entry,"I love this cd, I listen to it everyday when Im in my car driving down the road. There are a few songs that I don't like all that well but for the most part its great. And I dont really like any of the bonus songs either. So I would have been happier with the cd that didnt have the bonus tracks."
1,"Great Olympics, poor NBC coverage","Aside from this being full screen SD and only 2 discs, NBC's coverage was awful. Not paying to hear the same awful, inaccurate commentary and see the same edits. BBC have one out in October with 3 discs on amazon uk. Not sure of the region, but if I have to buy a new region free blu ray player to watch it, I will."
1,NBC not including all of ceremonies,"I went to the NBC site and here is what it says:This commemorative 2012 Olympic Highlights Blu-ray features Team USA best achievements, as well as the most exciting moments of the 2012 London Olympic Games, and it includes:*Highlights of London's 2012 Opening Ceremony directed by Oscar-winning Director Danny Boyle*London Opening Ceremony Parade of Nations & the Lighting of the Olympic Torch*Team USA athletes go for the gold in Gymnastics, Swimming, Diving, Track & Field and much more*Coverage of final heats of competition and Gold Medal Finals*Memorable segments from the Closing CeremonyHighlights and Memorable Segments. I can not even express my rage at NBC adequately."
1,Wait for The BBC Blu Ray.,If you want to see how The Olympics should be be done wait for the 9 hour+ BBC Blu Ray.
1,Insulting That This Will Only Include Highlights,"It absolutely shocks me how bad NBC screwed up coverage of the London Olympics and now this. It makes absolutely NO SENSE that the FULL opening and closing ceremonies will not be included on this blu ray...but this is NBC, I really shouldn't be that shocked. Nice job dropping the ball once again..."
2,BBC versus NBC,One reviewer points that the BBC are releasing a blu-ray and DVD (in September 2012). Amazon.co.uk lists them at 22.99 and 19.99 pounds sterling. The extra disc may be worth the extra money.
1,Very Poor,It is disgraceful that this release does not offer the complete Opening and Closing Ceremonies. Without a doubt the BBC will do a much better job. I only hope it will be a region free offering. Save your money on this very poor product.
1,"just bits and pieces, not full version",the whole opening and closing was not on it. Just a few minutes of both of them. the same with the events.not all of it. It's a waste of money. I have never been so disappointed. What was the point in using blu ray. there wasn't that much.
1,"Bad review of this disc set, much prefer the BBC version (5 disc)","Viewed a friends copy of the NBC 2 disc set, and having myself purchase the the BBC version 5 disc set, I would rate the NBC version 1 star and the BBC version 5 star. Overall the NBC version seems incomplete compared to the BBC version. For about the same purchase price it's a no brainer to buy the BBC version (from Amazon.UK). One word of caution, the BBC version is all region, however you need a player to convert from 1080i/50hz to 1080p/60hz, this leaves owners of Panasonic and Sony at a disadvantage. I watched the BBC version on my computer and also a Sharp BD player."
1,BAD BAD BAD BAD and BAD,"I am outraged by the garbage presented here by NBC. I pre-ordered this and will never do so again. I was hoping to see the opening and closing ceremony as they ruined them when shown live. All you get is a couple of minutes of each - but hey you do get all of the beach volleyball final!!!!!! I mean who really gives a hoot about beach volleyball? This is the worst thing I have ever bought from Amazon, NBC need to hang their collective heads in shame.As I am a British ex-pat living in the US I do own a multi-region DVD player so I guess I have to go and buy the BBC version.Please don't waste your money on this junk, NBC don't deserve to make any money out of this.BAD BAD BAD BAD BAD BAD BAD"
1,Poor customer services too!,"Please do not buy this DVD/Blu-Ray unless if the highlights of the Olympics Games are good enough for you. If you are looking for a full version of the Opening and Closing ceremony, you will be disappointed.I wrote a complaint email to NBC store online and received rude and blunt responses from their snarky customer services representative:""Subject---------------------------------------------------------------London 2012 Closing and Opening CeremonyDiscussion Thread---------------------------------------------------------------Response Via Email(Temica W.) - 08/24/2012 10:30 AMDear xxxx,Thank you for your email. Thank you for taking the time to send us your comments. We regret that due to the volume of email we receive, we are not able to respond to all messages, but your feedback is always greatly appreciated.Sincerely,TemicaCustomer Care Center"""
1,"Don't waste your money, really.","One word review: FAIL.If you're looking to watch Olympic highlights, get the BBC disc set. NBC fails to do justice to both the Games and Team USA.You know its bad when they just take ""highlights"" from Gabby Douglas' 2 minute floor routine in the individual all around. Yes, they edited it down - who knows why. Any other event you might have been hoping to watch again has been given the same treatment. Oddly, it makes me wish NBC has just released the coverage they aired during the actual Games."
1,Why SD format on Bluray ?,"This pre-order says it's Bluray, 2 discs, but 1.33:1 which is SD format, not HD format. Why? These were broadcast in 1.78:1 format....."
5,Our Provider Revealed,"God's Provision by Charles Swindoll tackles the huge subject of the biblical affirmation of God's provision in a very small, well-illustrated book.Our human frailties of stress, worry, temptation, fear and the like are exposed, softened by many of Swindoll's penetrating expressions like, "" We think of love as something that is giving, but sometimes love involves taking away something that would not be best."" Most of the expressions are noted with biblical verse for reference and assurance.A must on an ""encourager's"" bookshelf, a perfect gift for those who need to be reminded that God is our provider through all our personal trials."
3,For the JFK enthusiast,"Dictating from purgatory, JFK sheds light on his life and all that has been written about him since his death. JFK talks about his mob connections, his friendship with Frank Sinatra, his feelings about Nixon, Jackie, LBJ, and Martin Luther King, his hatred for J. Edgar Hoover, and his affairs with Marilyn Monroe and Judith Campbell.LBJ, Adlai Stevenson, J. Edgar Hoover, and Martin Luther King chime in as well.With Kennedy wit and charm, Mayer brings Kennedy to life. Irreverent, wry, and suspenseful, it's hard to distinguish between fact and fiction.Finally, the book also offers some illumination regarding Kennedy's assassination and death."
4,Wow,If you have a chance to purchase this machine. Just do it! You will not be dissapointed. Just wait for the sale to be offered to make it even more of a bargain.Follow up 8/16/12 -- One review listed why in the world would CSW stop making these. Does anybody know the answer?If you were not lucky enough to purchase these when they still made them....I really feel bad for you! If you were lucky enough to have read the reviews and purchased 1!!!!!! I really feel bad for you too! I am one of those. There arent any used ones even being offered currently with the sites that I have looked.
4,Driftwood sculpture,I found the book very interesting and informative. Patricia found the nack for holding your interest and movitating your inner self.I wish she would have lead me to more resources dealing with the finishing and the location of show/events. Instead of where the buy tools. I need to know where the LuRon competitions are held and the how to contact them for there rules in order to finish my wood. This is totally new to my area and the web has not been much help. But the information contained in the book is exactly what I needed at the time.I have to say she left me thirsty for more.
5,Utterly reliable - It's like an international Joy of Cooking,"I love this cookbook. Every recipe in it is delicious and completely reliable. Over time, it's become one of the first places I look when exploring cuisine from a different country. All too often, I'd spend hours on the internet or in other cookbooks only to realize that all along the best version was in this book. For example, when I became obsessed with making Ethiopian food, I tried lots of recipes for Ethiopian spiced butter, including Marcus Samuelson's, and ultimately decided that I like the one in this cookbook the best. This is one of the top three most consistently good cookbooks in my collection (the others are Rick Bayless's first book, and Baking with Julia). Even though I'm not vegetarian, it will always have a place on the ""best cookbooks"" shelf in the kitchen."
4,Sundays at Moosewood Restaurant,This is a classic and as appropriate for today's cooks as when it was written. I wanted to learn how to make foods with an international flair and this has it---Plus commentary.
5,The one cookbook I keep going back to...,"I first got this cookbook when I was in college back in the early 90's in Rochester, NY. I made several recipes for my roommates and they loved them! I have never made anything from this book that turned out less than delicious. I seldom post reviews on anything, but I think this cookbook warrants my review. My favorites are the Cape Verde Vegetable Soup, Groundnut Stew, Moroccan Stew and the Rusks (with a cup of chocolate chips thrown in). I have a whole legion of rusk followers now who have asked for the recipe : ). I just called one of my old roommates and she told me that she wanted to make a batch of choc. chip rusks so bad last year and she lost the xerox, that she went to her public library and found the book in the stacks and made a new xerox! That's love : )"
5,Consistently delicious recipes,"With 18 cultural/geographical groups of recipes, this cookbook offers a wonderful array of tastes to choose from. Browsing through it is guranteed to give you meal ideas. Alternatively, its comprehensive list of ingredients helps point you in the direction of specifica recipes using, for example, pumpkins or lentils or shiitake mushrooms. We've tried many of its entries and have yet to find a miss."
2,NOT a vegetarian cookbook!,"While the vegetarian recipes in ""Sundays at Moosewood"" are outstanding, it loses points for being misleading. This is NOT a vegetarian cookbook: there are recipes containing fish, shrimp, and shellfish, all of which by definition are animals. Mislabeling like this only makes things harder for those of us who really are vegetarian or vegan. Bottom line: if you want some great ethnic food with an overall vegetarian emphasis--because most of the recipes are vegetarian--it's a great cookbook. But vegetarians (whether ovo-lacto or vegan) don't eat fish, shrimp, oysters, clams, or other aquatic animals, so don't be misled into thinking that this is a truly vegetarian cookbook."
3,the truth about this book,"It explains very well the color principle and some design techniques. It is a good book for beginning graphic artists with no formal art background (those who never studied art/GD in school). There are 5 parts to this book. Part one establishes desing principles, part 2 examines common color principles related to the use of color pigments, part 3 helps the beginner develop systematic color thinking with the aid of excercises, part 4 introduces priciples and techniques for generating colors on the computer and part 5 presents color sets and guides for attaining color harmony.Note, however, that this book is a bit outdated. It showed when trying to explain certain design techniques using old version Photoshop tool bar."
2,OUTdated,"This is not the best book out there. The first section of the 5 section book goes into form and shape theory, which although useful in design, is just filler to give the book more pages. The color theory sections are fairly basic. I think there are better books out there, especially for the price."
4,very nice.,"These pegs are a nice alternative to buying a tailpiece with built-in fine tuners. They will slip if you leave them ""loose"". Gear tension can be adjusted by gently pushing in to tighten or pulling out to loosen, much like friction pegs. I love how smooth they are. They make tuning a breeze! (make sure to get them professionally installed)."
2,Not non-slip,"I'm not sure why these get such good reviews. I spent $125 on these and they do not hold their tune. It says ""non-slip"", but they do slip. Also I feel like I can't tune as precisely with these as I could with fine tuners. I'm planning to remove them and get a tailpiece with built-in tuners."
4,A worthwhile quick read,"Not earth-shattering or impressive, still this collection of stories written by President Ronald Reagan is a worthwhile glimpse into the thinking of our former president. Each story is brief, a format that lends itself well to a person whose habit is to read a book little bits at a time due to a busy schedule. I found the stories insightful and well done, further demonstrating to me the depth and integrity of someone I've admired for many years."
1,Trashing America,this is the same tired anti-american screed the left has been peddling for the last 100 years. Lapham gloats over the humbling of america and calls on the nation to admit that it is to blame for Sept. 11 and just about everything else that is wrong with the world. yawn.
2,Elegant hyperbole,"It's rare to read a political book as elegantly phrased and as easy to read as this one. Unfortunately it is not a serious contribution to an understanding of the Bush years. One is tempted to be overwhelmed by the relief at finding a substantial criticism of the Bush/Cheney/Rumsfeld axis that one fails to notice that the hyperbole, exaggeration and downright untruths undermine Lewis's almost poetic prose."
1,Be warned. This book is NOT what the publisher says it is.,"The book is such esoteric theory as to make it useless. It is not, as the publisher writes, ""an introductory book on data and databases"". The book just rambles from detailed database theory to disconnected everyday description, and back again. If you want to learn about how databases work, this isn't the book for you."
4,She liked it and I didn't,"Girlfriend wanted me to get a thinner condom. I bought this and Magnum Thin. Though I doubt that she really knows the difference she said that she liked this one best and I like Magnum Thin. Personally, I thought it was too tight and suffocating. At the end of the day it's what makes her happy. So I bought a few of these and a bunch of the other. If I have too, I will buy the product again."
4,a good option for those with arthritis,I have severe Rheumatoid Arthritis and find most traditional type fitness videos hard to follow. Because this video series has more basic guidelines of fluid motion I find I am able to follow along without hurting myself. The motions can be interpreted differently every time you participate which helps to keep me interested and motivated.
2,Doesn't discuss iPod's biggest issue,"This book completely ducked the most controversial aspect of owning an iPod: the limited number of recharges (and ultimate battery replacement) that each and every iPod owner faces. Instead, Mr. Breen choses to talk about how to prolong a single battery charge (turn off backlighting), and not how to extend the limited life of the Apple-provided battery. For example, is it good or bad for an iPod to be left plugged into its dock, after it has fully recharged? Also missing was advice on replacing the battery with internet available kits, use of non-Apple replacement battery services, the value of Apple's own AppleCare warranty, etc. Overall, the book had a few useful tips (available for free on many web sites), seemed very out of date for Windows versions and on any 2003 iPod releases, and generally felt like a poor value. I also felt that Amazon.com's advertising made it sound current, when in fact it is not. I am sorry that I purchased it from Amazon."
3,Very simple,The book does not reveal many real secrets. The few interesting curiosities in it can be found also in any users forum into the Internet.
2,Good but not great,"I recently purchased a 40GB iPod and am using it with iTunes on a PC. This book is helpful but it was published before the 40GB unit (not a big deal) but also before iTunes was ported to the PC. Most the information in here is easily learned through the basic user manual, some experimentation and a visit to some of the iPod sites that exist. In reading this you need to make that adjustment.All that said it was not a waste of money, I learned quite a few useful things but it took a lot of reading through things I already knew.Technology moves quickly and it is not unusual for books on breaking technology like the iPod to be out of date nearly as soon as they hit the stores."
5,shocking!,"Did you know that there's a New Testament verse etched into the inside casing of every iPod? Or that the original name was ePod, but they didn't want it to be ""doPe"" spelled backwards? Or that the original concept of the iPod came about through Apple's failed attempt to create the iVibrator?Learn these and other shocking yet true secrets behind the sordid and scandalous history of the iPod in this well-written and well-illustrated guide. Mr. Breen is certainy back in form after a much-hyped, but frankly under-delivering, ""Mac 911"""
2,Gift for my Husband,This was a Christmas gift for my husband but he didn't really like them that well. He gave them away to our son.
5,Excellent,"This is a warm, comforting book with gently taught lessons on how to manage with a rare cancer. The importance of finding expert doctors is gently but unforgettably remarked upon. The man has a generosity of character and spirit that makes reading this book a calming as well as an educating experience. He demonstrates by example an exemplary way of dealing with cancer, its many setbacks, and its many frustrations. WELL WORTH READING. Beg, borrow or steal a copy."
4,"Hooyah, platoons!","In this film about an Ivy Leaguer who ends up in the Peace Corps in Thailand by mistake, communists, the CIA, and organized crime are thwarted by a disinterested aristocrat who takes them on soley for the purpose of supporting what Burke called his little ""platoon."" Volunteers spoofs Bridge on the River Kwai, Indiana Jones, Casablanca, Lawrence of Arabia, Apocalypse Now, and probably other films. Although apparently reformed by True Love, we see him at the end with capitalist designs for his little Thai paradise. Although missing great performances or production values, this movie is great fun."
5,Great Movie for the Cougs,"Any movie which contains the fight song of the greatest university on the face of the Earth, no doubt, is worth five stars if not more. Besides that, it is just a great movie. Go Cougs!!!!!"
1,A Movie Tom Hanks would like to forget,"I'd actually like to give this 0 stars.This lame film set in Southeast Asia is a complete waste of time.I love John Candy and miss him very much, but would not watch this film again even if it was the only way to see John. And Tom Hanks has become one of greatest livingg actors.That being said this film stinks. It is a poorly written about some peace corps types dealing with some way over done CIA types.Rent or by Plains, Trains or Automobiles, you'll be a lot happier."
4,Excellent player for the money,"I seriously wonder if the person that wrote the other review in this area had the (E)xtended (S)kip (P)rotection (ESP) turned on when he tried this player. I stood in one spot and did jumping jacks, while playing a 128 kbps mp3 cd, for 117 seconds before it skipped. It was comparable (about 25 seconds) with a regular CD. I loved the rich bass and sound quality. A few things to consider are, 1. Buy a higher quality pair of headphones, you won't regret it. 2. Use 'better quality' cds when you burn your music and use the highest bit rate encode that will allow you to fit the amount of music you want on the cd. 3. High capacity nimh batteries (2400 mah) will give you longer play times and can be recharged hundreds of times. Remember! The antenna for the radio is the headphone wire so your position affects reception greatly.Overall I rate this player as excellent for the price. ENJOY!"
2,Not great.,"Not the best production of Romeo and Juliet. Mercutio is too perverse at times. Yes, he is supposed to be perverse - but it is supposed to be subtle - the hand and tongue gestures are a bit too much. And Romeo reminds me of the UPS guy from MadTV. He cannot stand still to deliver a line. Very distracting. Juliet is tepid."
5,Great tape from FastCap!,"All of the FastCap tape measures are fanstastic. I've got two of the green, a yellow, and this one. the pencile sharpener is highly useful, love the writting pad, and the story pole lets you make a story stick out of a tape measure. great feature!"
1,Budge's Hierogliphic Dictionary,This book is entirely outdated and really should not remain in print. For a good Egyptian Dictionary use R. Faulkner's Concise Dictionary of Middle Egyptian.
5,Got it at last!!!,"And well worth it!From the mind of the philosopher Hakim Bey, this brilliant work. On the surface, a collection of essays on heresies of Islam, rebellious subcultures, from the Black Muslims to Sufism with a good bit of history from afar and near not commonly in history books. Under the surface...a jihad for a more powerful yet subtle Islam to reach the ""West"" but at the same time crack the foundations of the fanatics who are used to give it a bad name.I'm paraphrasing a popular comedian as much as Hakim Bey. We make a sh-tty ""Christian Nation"" but we just might make a halfway decent ""Liberal Muslim"" nation.Though just a collection of amusing reads speckled with interesting composite art and Rumic poetry, this book is ten times as subversive as ""Steal this book!"". I hope more people get it and that there is a second, updated printing..."
2,unreliable at best,"an earlier review compared Dilger's story to a college term paper. Atleast a college term paper sites sources when making the kind of claims she asserts. She reports"" facts"" on a wide range of subjects from the political strife of the country to child malnutititon and death statistics without ever siting a source, listing a works cited or even trying to show the reader that this is a document to lay any trust in. If I wanted to engage in reading a story of fiction I would have chosen a more engaging writer. I looked on the publishers website to find author contact information to no avail. Dilger should be admonished or provide some explinnation for this very basic lack of substantiated reseach into her subject. It seems to me that any gossip or rumor that fell on her ears became fact just from her having heard it and these claims are then served to us as the flipping gospel. A college term paper would have been many steps above Dilger's work in my humble opinion."
4,Decent quick meals,"I bought this cookbook for my daughter. She loves it. She likes the simplicity and being able to put a good meal on the table quickly. For the culinary snobs, unwilling to use canned (gasp!) packaged (arrgh!) or prefab (?) food--get out your Martha Stewart cookbook and spend 6 hours making dinner!This is a great cookbook for beginners and those pressed for time."
3,Ok... not really that different.,This book was ok. It didn't have a lot of great new ideas for quick meals. And the things really do take longer than what the time says in the book.
4,"Great for ""new"" cooks!","I purchased this item as a gift for my sister, who has not cooked much before. She loves it. She made the recipe for the picture on the cover - skillet lasagne - and her boyfriend said it tasted like a meal from a restaurant. She is now excited to cook at home and trying more recipes."
3,Understanding Jihad,"This book is very good at describing the martial aspect of jihad. The author articulates the historical literature about the subject very well. However, I do not feel that the conclusions he draws are accurate. He is rather dismissive of the connotation that the term has come to have in the last couple of centuries. Overall, the scholarship and writing are very well done. However, it should be read along with other books to get a complete view about what constitutes jihad. Anyone who says that it is objective, though, is terribly misled."
2,A flawed mix of magic and mystery,"I was eager to read this mystery set in the southwest. However, on the first page there is a reference to our heroine in a small plane crossing the Utah-New Mexico border. The only place where Utah and New Mexico even touch is at Four Corners. Hardly a border. I was ready to overlook that goof and went on with the mystery. It was only mildly exciting, relying too much on this author's concept of magic realism. I was also disappointed in the many errors when Spanish words were used. I don't know if this is the fault of the author or poor editing, but the errors could easily have been checked in a dictionary. Let's hope the next book by Norma Lehr shows a bit more care with details and drama."
2,Not quite as advertised,"Shoes were advertised as narrow, but actually are a C width with a very wide front toe box. As a person with a narrow foot, they are not very comfortable. But since the price was so low, I kept them (and just use thick inserts"
4,"simple, comfort shoes","I think the shoes is quite comfortable, look nice and solid. With 30$ for purchase, no expectation more. good for office daily use."
4,200 Piece Poker Set,"200 Standard size chips but their weight is on the light and gives them a cheap feel. Quality of chips is lacking, printing and molding is inconsistent. The surface of the chips are not shiny plastic but more like the better ""clay"" chips.The aluminum case came slightly dented but nothing horrible. Had to add foam to the case to keep everything from shifting around while carrying.Overall quality is mediocre. Still, for the price it is a good set."
4,Not bad,"It arrived with only one set of cards inside, which is not how it was advertised (the seller said it would have two decks of cards). The wording on the box itself says it comes with only one set of cards, so this is an error on the seller's part. I read the other reviews before buying it, so wasn't surprised. I bought this for a teenager who loves to play cards, and he was very happy with it. It's a good starter set, in my opinion."
4,OK Product,"The chips are sturdy (though not really what I expected) and the case is durable and solid, but the second pack of cards in the description was not included at all. There was just an empty space where it was supposed to be. Everything was sealed though, so I feel like the product was mislabeled in the factor."
3,Not as expected,I received this product today. I am little disappointed especially with chips. Chips are pretty low quality. I have seen better chips even for lower price but only the case is not present. Case also came with little damage. It's just fine to use for fun but as expected quality.
5,Very nice for the price,"The chips are thin but strong enough to not be just snapped in half or anything. I have nor problems with it and am happy I purchased, was a good deal"
3,Missing parts,"Much like other reviews I see, it arrived with a missing decks of cards.Other than that, it's a good deal, but the sloppiness of delivery warrants only 3 stars. The case is decent enough quality, chips are fine, was delivered promptly; all in all, worth the price, except for receiving an incomplete set."
4,great poker kit,"This poker kit is especially great b/c I've had others before that did not include the aluminum case so all the chips fell out everywhere. The case is great, the whole thing is excellent!"
4,Case made cheaply,The case is made very cheaply. Not worth the money. You can buy better and more poker chips (300) with a case too at Target for $20. vs. 16.99 for 200 very cheaply made set.
2,Caution! Items missing,"This Poker set is nice, though box for cards unstucked very quickly. But the most disappointing was that the second deck was missing. Package was sealed so I think that the deck was missed at factory."
2,Decline in Quality by Cardinal.,"I had a really nice set from Cardinal five years ago, but the chips in this set are inconsistent, flimsy, and the painting on the chips is just plain awful."
4,ucc cofee reveiw,"ucc cofee is probably one of the best cofee drinks I have had recently. it has a nearly perfect blend of coffee and milk, in my opinion it ranks well against many other cofee drinks. I highly recomend this product"
4,Secrets of the North Table,"Alan Hafer has truly captured the western Nebraaka landscape and the soul of those hearty pioneers who first settled on the praries. As a former Nebraskan, a state that still has my heart, I was moved by this story of the people. Hafer did not sugar-coat it. The good, strong-hearted ranchers and settlers, juxtaposed against those who joined the Klan and those who alwalys wanted the plains to be a frontier.I heartily recommend, Secrets of the North Table, for anyone who wants to read a great story.Gary Welch"
2,toy medics kit,cute little toy kit with general tools fo the medical profession represented in kids size format. ok for the under 6 set.
1,Political hack defends his pals,"Should be titled ""I am a Facist and Westmoreland was a great general"". His other book on the Vietnam war was quite interesting. This one is not worth reading. Among other police state fantasies he wants censorship of the press. Rather than accept that the pentagon and Dept. of defense (and LBJ) conducted the war poorly, he claims we were stabbed in the back by the Liberals and media. If you believe thats why we failed to win and you think Westmoreland was a great general who conducted the war well, you will love this book.If you are interested in little known facts about the war look elsewhere."
2,Outdated Map Data,"Upon installation I view the map for my own city, Bend, Oregon. The major highway, completed 7 years ago, is not shown! Numerous other missing and mislabeled roads make the map so unreliable as to be almost useless. Other paper and electronic maps, even those 5 years old, have the major roads shown correctly."
1,Extremely Outdated,"I have a GPS in my car, and Microsoft Streets and Trips 2005. I saw this product today at Office Depot, and it looked like it might be easier to use to import data points, so I thought that I'd give it a try. It was the newest version in the store. It was more than twice as expensive as the new version of Microsoft Streets and Trips.I was searching for about 20 points this evening for a business presentation. Almost none of them were found by this software. The maps are very outdated. In fact, Microsoft S&T; 2005 was much more up to date. The DeLorme product had missing addresses for major buildings that had been in place since 2002. Fully one half of one city (Frisco, Texas) was missing (including it's professional soccer team and stadium) that has a population today of 100,000.Buy an outdated used copy of Microsoft Streets and Trips. Better functionality, newer maps, and probably almost free these days."
1,Waste of Money,"This Map Program is so incomplete it is not even funny. My house has been built for over 5 years, and my street still does not even show up on the map. And I do not live in a rural area. My office has been there for over 10 years and this map cannot locate it either. How can I depend on this map to get me to new places I need to go if I can't even trust it to get me around my home town."
2,Disappointed,"I was disappointed in this product because of the outdated map data. Now, I'm not talking about a new street in town that wasn't on the map; I'm referring to a well-known, main street in town that has been there for years that wasn't on the map.I bought the product for a countywide project on which I was working. For the most part, it was acceptable, but there were entire areas of subdivisions that had not been updated.I wouldn't buy it again unless I was assured of more accuracy. Delorme should put out some updates to get this right. There's quite a bit more they could do to the product to make it better. I'd even be willing to pay a little more if I was assured of a better product."
2,Who chose the music???,"I have the first of Christina's yoga dvds and I really enjoy it. But on this one, you have no music choice and the music is just awful. The practice is slow and controlled, but the music is very irritating. I've felt this way about the music on other yoga dvds, so it may just be me, but I think it ruins the practice which is very much like the first dvd anyway. So stick with that one if you have it."
3,"If you are interesting in playing, this is not for you","It's not a very indepth book. If you just want some goaltending highlights go for it, but if you are serious about learning more choose something else."
1,Not so good:(,"I recently bought the sega pc mega pack at gamestop, but for some reason, almost none of the games work on my pc, especially the sonic games. I have a windows xp home edition operating system with directx9, a gforce2 integrated cpu, and an amd athlon 1800+ processor. I have no idea what the problem is, except that maybe my computer is actually too NEW. It really sucks because I was looking foward to playing the sonic games, since im a big sonic fan. Outrun is another one of my favorites in the mega pack. If any of you guys have solutions for this problem i'd like to hear them. The reason i gave this game a 1 star is NOT the games themselves, but rather the compatibility of them."
5,One of Sci-Fi's best!!!!,"Smith's imagination knew no bounds. He could present the best, most detailed history of the universe in a language that all readers could understand. He brought back the action in sci-fi."
4,Very Entertaining.,"""Galactic Patrol"" is the third book in the Lensman series, but it is a collection of the first Lensman stories ever written. This material was published in ""Astounding Science Fiction"" from September of 1937 through February 1938 before being published in book form in 1950. This series was nominated for the Hugo for best all-time series in 1966.It is the story of Kimball Kinnison, from his graduation into the Galactic Patrol, through his first mission which was more likely to end in death then success, on to his promotion to a Gray Lensman, and his location and destruction of the Boskone command base in our galaxy.The science in this story is this book's greatest weakness, but that is made up for by the fast pace, interesting characters, and engaging situations. If you are looking for something light and very entertaining to read, this is a great place to start. Sit back and enjoy."
2,My 18month old just isn't drawn to this book,"I don't know what she don't like about it, but if I even open it up she wants to close it right away and this is not her normal self when it comes to books!"
4,Love it/Hate it,"Usually my problem with Let's Go is there's so few changes from year to year. This time, they've totally revamped the format, but the result is unorganized and less informative. It just seems like there's less *stuff* in it. Some lame pictures, arranged largely by topic instead of neighborhood (boo!), some walking maps that don't indicate mileage. That said, it's still the best choice if you're looking to travel cheap or if you're younger, or both. A major improvement is more extensive coverage of the boroughs outside of Manhattan. It's still worth its small price, but I'd get another, more traditional guide book as well."
5,Helped a country bumpkin get around the Big Apple,"I am untravelled, unexperienced with city life, and un-financially blessed. Let's Go was my bible in NYC last winter and I had a grand ol' time. Between my pals and I we had like 800 guide books, and Let's Go had by far the most readable, most helpful maps. The fact that its written by poor students (with wit and style) helps too. A good mix of traditional tourist activities with ""undiscovered"" budget happenings."
1,My son's big wish this Christmas = big disappointment,"Reading other reviews on this game, I'm amazed that Amazon is still selling this piece of junk. The game resets the score at random, and that takes so much of the fun out of it. My son played with it for about 5 minutes before he got bored with it, since you can't really try to ""top"" your high score. I came on Amazon to order him another one, thinking maybe we just had a bad one, but other reviewers had the exact same problem. We ended up tossing his big wish for Christmas into the trash because he hasn't touched it but that one time."
3,100 Pt score doesn't work,"This is a really fun game to play, but upon opening the game the 100 pt scorer doesn't register when a ball goes through it and one of teh lights on teh left side doesn't work. Kind of a bummer."
5,fun,I think the adults have been playing this more than the kids since x-mas. better than expected. haven't had any problems yet with the electronics like I read about and hopefully won't cuz we like it.
2,"So, So....best I can say","I bought this for my son for Christmas and the best I can say is it's OK. I imagine it would be more fun if it actually worked as intended on a consistent basis. The score board as other reviewers have noted works pretty much when it feels like it. Sometimes it does the two player mode, sometimes not. The score stops tallying after a while sometimes too or it doesn't keep score at all. My bigger problem is where the two sections connect. Ours does not fit together properly leaving a slight bump in the pathway of the ball. This results in a projectile effect sending it flying over the clear plastic ""cage"" meant to prevent the ball from flying across the room. I've held on to the box and it may very well go back. My advice: buy something else."
4,Fun but Faulty,"My 6 year old son loves this game, as does his 67 year old Grandad! Unfortunately I too had trouble with the scoreboard. The first set of batteries peeled and popped open. The second set lasted a few games before they stopped working. The third set is hit or miss. It's so much fun when it works, just frustrating when it doesn't. I agree with another reviewer that a plug-in version would have been better, it seems the batteries just keep short circuiting."
4,Great fun for kids and adults!,"My five-year old loves to play skee-ball at the local arcade. I bought this for a Christmas present for him and our entire family loves to play. Everyone can compete. The lights and sounds make it very exciting. Sometimes the scoring mechanism fails to register the points scored. But it really isn't a big deal, since it's all in fun. My husband has become quite competitive with my son. I'm not really sure who enjoys this game more!"
4,arcade speedball,"This is a nice toy for younger kids, maybe up to 10 years. A little to small for adults. It was fun."
4,"Fun, but too many losable parts.","A nice toy, but there's too many parts to lose or get scattered. The toy also comes apaart into two pieces, which I soon glued together. I'd buy it for a 5 or 6 year old, but not younger."
1,Product was sold as new and is clearly used,"I bought this product as new. It was a gift for my son. I took it out to wrap tonight and noticed a sound coming from the box as if parts were loose. That is when I noticed that the box was opened. When I took the game out, it looks old and the pieces looked scratched, rusty, and dusty. It has clearly been used and is not worth the $28.53 that I paid for it. Not sure if it even works. I am VERY disappointed in this product and now my son is minus a Christmas gift."
2,Scoring DOES NOT WORK (tried twice),"We had the same experience as some of the other reviewers with the scoring not working. We bought this for my 7 year old son for Christmas. He was so excited, but then we quickly realized the points would register only about 20% of the time and the unit would just shut off after a couple of balls. He still liked it because he can add it all up in his head really well...but I thought I'd try to return it and see if I just got a dud. Well, we just received the second one. The first 5 balls worked and I was getting excited...THEN IT TURNED OFF...UGH!!! We're going to keep it and use our brains for the math (probably a good thing!) But if you want the electronic scoring to work, pass this toy up."
3,NOT good enough,"I was so excited when I started to build it for the kids. We played it for about 30 mins, and it got boring after that. In addition, the clear plastic that prevents the ball from jumping out is bent so its pretty much useless. A word of advice to buyers: the track is divided into two, so when you flick the ball, it wont follow the line that you want the ball to go to, it will roll first then when it gets to the divided section, it will chose its own line and go from there..."
1,scoring board a bust,"This toy did not work from the moment we opened it. Any ball that hits just under the 100pt or to the side of the 50pt shuts the game OFF!If you are thinking about getting this game, don't count on the scoring mechanism working - just read the other reviews first. I had read them ad thought ""oh MINE will work fine!""NO FUNElectronic Arcade SpeedballIdeal Table Top Games Electronic Arcade Speedball"
1,Do Not Buy - Problem with Scoreboard and Ball return,"I bought this toy for my 2 sons because it looked like fun. When it arrived, the score board did not work out of the box. But the toy seeemed to be reasonably well built otherwise. So because of the Christmas rush, I ordered a 2nd one in the hope that the scoreboard would work better. The second one arrived and it seemed to work OK so we gave it to me 2 sons on Christmas morning. After about 10 minutes of play, the scoreboard on the new set went on the blink. Another reviewer had the same exact experience (twice). This seems to by a systemic problem with the manufacture of this toy. And to make matters worse, the ball return stopped working. Fun game concept, but poor manufacturing. Do not buy unless you want to be disappointed."
5,Ultra Fast Speed from a Fantastic product.,"As the title says. Need I say more?! Ok. This product ""is"" the fastest hard drive for the price and could well be faster than products costing more! Order 4, and place them in a raid array, and I swear you have never seen speed like this!"
5,GoGo Crate,"This crate is light weight but very sturdy. It took 15 seconds to unfold and set up. It has two convenient doors and a handle on top which makes it easy to move. It also came with a divider. It is strong enough for permanent use yet light enough for travel also. Amazing low price, this crate is a great deal."
4,Informative and practical,"The books contains excellent information on some stones and metals. Very practical also. It's not ""The Complete Guide to Stone Power"" due to it's limited amount of listed stones. But with the ones that are being explained the author did a great job. Great for beginners, or the very busy business person interested."
5,great book to get started with gemstones,"I just started to learn about gemstones for use with the chakras, and healing, etc. This book was recommended to me and I'm glad it was."
5,Sobering,"Globalistan provides a picture of present conditions and the likely future in India, China, Russia and the ""stans"" as well as Africa and the mid-east.The book contains names of people and places I was unfamiliar with. Far from confusing -- Mr. Escobar always gets his points across -- these essays made me realize how much is missed in the main stream or popular media.Whether by design or incompetence we Americans are kept ignorant of the extent to which the planet is affected by the greed and corruption of those who consider themselves citizens of the world, and thus indifferent to any suffering of the place-bound rest of us.This book helps dispel some of the ignorance and is therefore sobering. Be forewarned that reading it may permanently affect how you view even those sources you consider reliably informed."
2,On Globalistan,"Pepe Escobar's Globalistan is, in the author's words, ""a warped geopolitical travel book"" that aims to transform and politicize the reader's understanding of the interrelated processes which facilitate and perpetuate ""globalization, energy wars and the Pentagon's Long War."" The text, as much a work of abstract political theory as it is reportage, is a brief but overly complicated polemic that ultimately fails to present a practical alternative to the world views and socio-economic practices which the author clearly set out to challenge. The literary and theoretical references and allusions which riddle the text are sure to interest some (myself included), but Escobar's awkward phraseology and penchant for abstraction-for-the-sake-of-abstraction can at times be distracting. Ultimately, the book may be of value to students of sociology, political science and heterodox economics, but it is almost certain to tire and/or bore the average and relatively apolitical reader."
1,Only for the Committed Leftest,"If you are committed to leftest views and want to reinforce your perspective, Mr. Escobar is for you. This book is written in the spirit of Noam Chompsky and Howard Zin - agenda driven, emotionally charged and very unbalanced. There is nothing really wrong with that, however you need to know what you are getting into. I was hoping to expand my understanding of the impact of Globalization and did not get that here - unfortunatley I chose this book on impulse. To be fair, I didn't finish it as it was the same leftest position rehashed yet again. Pepe is also a very poor writer so I found the book difficult to read.If, on the other hand, you are looking to expand your mind and truly gain new insight on Globalization - stay clear of this book and please let me know if you find something more insightful."
1,Trash from a two-bit anti-American,Yet another worthless rag from the blame-America crowd. I can only hope that Mr. Escobar lives to see Chinese overlords call the shots. Then he and his bunk-buddies will have time to repent at leisure. Pepe is part of that vast flotilla of human detritus floating upon a sea of irrational anti-American fear mongering and conspiracy stories. He makes a living at it. The mentally ill will love this book.
3,Overpriced,"This was what I wanted and it does the job it was designed to do, but 6 filters (glorified coffee filters) for $20...give me a break. WAY overpriced."
3,Different from the original filter!,"These filters are, in my opinion, inferior to the filters that come with the Eastman pump. The bottom edges of the filers are square as opposed to the round edges of the original filters. The square shape doesn't fit as well on the round-shaped end of the pump, and it seems that this poor fit affects the speed at which the oil flows up through the pump."
1,NOT a standard 2.5 uses a 3.5 to 2.5 adapter,"The sound is good but there kind of cheep. There not a solid piece, they are an in ear headphone with over the ear plastic part that fits in them. The ear buds seem to want to go sidewise as a result. Also there oddly lopsided with the mic and answer device being very short. Finlay they are not 2.5 standard which is what I really wanted there 3.5 with a 2.5 adapter, every adapter I tired fits loose for me. They are also to short, they keep pulling out when in my pocket."
3,"Really like them, but may not be reliable.","I am not an audiophile, but I think these earphones sound quite good. I use with my Ipod touch, and haven't had any problems until recently. I have only owned them for just under three months, and now only the right earbud is working, while the left is working sporadically. It isn't the Ipod or the jack (I tested the original Ipod earbuds, and they work fine) It may be the adapter or the mic. I like the cord, but if it rubs on your coat zipper it can transfer the noise to your ears, and it is NOT tangle resistant. I am going to try to get these replaced on warranty, and BE CAREFUL with the adapter, because it does give some leverage that may damage the jack. If they are replaced and I just got a lemon then these deserve 5 stars!"
3,"Close, but lacking","I was excited for a quality set of headphones, but these just didn't meet the mark. The complaints are true: the cord is short, and the music quality is lacking (maybe it's just my mp3 player phone?). Also, after about 10 minutes running, at least one ear bud gets slippery enough and starts to come out. I haven't had any complaints on the microphone quality, but if the thing doesn't work well enough to use, what's the point?"
4,Good BUT NOT Great!,The only thing I have against this producut is the EASY removable or interchangable clear ear insert covers. I have already lost 2. Otherwise it works good as headphones and cellphone earpiece.
3,Only for one player,"My kid loves this game, but the bad part is that only allows one player and it's not really fun for him because he can't play and enjoy when his friends are around. The other thing is that Game Cube games scratch easily. How do you keep a Four old from doing that?"
1,Won't load on Win98,"This might be a great game, but my son will never know. After taking forever to load, it won't run on Win98. Gives the very descriptive error message ""this program has performed an illegal operation and is closing"". The CD case says it will work with Win98, and two other Spongebob games he has work just fine. At least this was a gift so I wasn't the one who forked over $40 for a frisbee."
1,Horrible!!!!!,"A horrible mario wanaa be, what a disgrace krabbie patties are 1ups instead of green mushrooms, kelp mustashes give turn you into a men instead of super mushrooms that turn you into giant. Spongebob is ugly and a horrid character american animations for kids are horrible. Japanese animated characters look better. Every american animated charecters have square heads bodies polygonic characters very easy to draw. Overall spongebob is pathetic, the movie is bad too my smaller brother made me wach it and I hate it. ""Join mega man x instead he's more powerful than nickelodeon's pitiful characters Mega man x is better"""
5,it was great!!!,this game is good not too hard and not too confusing but i think you have to work at it to beat it and sometimes you have to time everything
4,GOOFY GOOBER GREATNESS!!!,"My 6 yr. old son is a diehard Spongebob fan. This game is ABSOLUTELY great! I got it for him shortly after watching the movie last year when he was 5 and he couldn't put it down to stop playing with it. The graphics are great; the music is GOOBERSPECTACULAR!!! It didn't take him long to beat the game but he will often come back to play with it because it is so much fun. So whether you want to play as Spongebob or Patrick, his starfish friend, young & old will enjoy yet another KRUSTY KRAB adventure."
4,"GREAT, but....","once you get pretty far in this game it gets VERY DIFFICULT. I hope this review isn't deceiving. If you enjoy Spongebob and have seen the movie, you will really like this game as I do, as hard as it tends to become. Perhaps it's because getting near the end of the game is the toughest challenge. Then the levels will seem almost impossible to beat. You'll see what I mean if you're planning on getting this game. Anyway, it's pretty good. You get the idea that it follows the exact same story, though. The game has realistic graphics and it could get involved if you let it. 4 and half stars overall."
5,great game,"i think that spongebob the movie may be the most funny, charming, addictive, and kid friendly game of the year. i am also having alot of fun with it, and i am 9. this game is very entertaining, and has levels that younger kids will love playing over again. however, there can be some frustirating levels that even i have difficulty with. overall, i think that this is a great game for kids young and old."
2,Too Frustrating.,The brutal difficulty level on the final boss battle in this game just ruined it for me. Who in the world do they think is playing a game like this? Hardcore Halo fans? If you don't care about finishing a game I guess it doesn't matter. Otherwise expect your little one to be in tears over this.
1,Condescending patronising spiritual nonsense,"I fear that one man has decided his expereinces in life give him the right to ""share"" and directly influence others in an unhealthy and manipulativce way. Mixing spiritual and psychological babble, does not help anyone who is struggling with important decisions. Some people are pyschologically, emotionally and spiritually damaged and do unusual and ""unnatural things"" according to their true identity. To assume that all homosexuals are maladjusted and fit this LDS perception of sexual misorientation is naive and condescending."
5,Required Reading For Aspiring Writers,"It puzzles me beyond belief that ""Writers on Writing"" is out of print. This book is a grand, well-chosen collection of quotes on such apects of writing--from getting published, to starting out, to writer's block. Jon Winokur is a quote-collecting master. When I first became serious about writing, I found this book at my local library, and found it hard to put down, and extremely helpful and insightful. I was being taught by the likes of such literary greats as Truman Capote, Lewis Carroll, Ralph Waldo Emerson, and F. Scott Fitzgerald. This is an educational journey all the way through, using down to earth quotes from those who know, rather than a drawn out step-by-step instructional book. It cured my writer's block, and improved my amateur work. Required reading for aspiring writers."
3,Good with some issues,"Think I've been spoiled by Rabbit Air... I got two of these, and the one in my room whistles. Like baby birds. It annoys me, so it's going to end up in my office and another Minus A2 will go in my room. It does noticeably clean the air, especially on its medium (very whistle-y) setting, but the lack of indicators bugs me, too. I don't want to call it crap, because it's not, but I do think it's a little overpriced for the very basic function it provides. About 250- 300$ would be more appropriate."
5,"Victor, 07052","Perfect look, low maintenance, (almost) no more dust at home. Very pity that I have the other brand in my bedroom, which needs to be cleaned periodically, otherwise I would buy one more such item."
2,"If you're a fan, well, o.k. then.",Pretty bad. Very bad. I'm a big fan so thought I'd buy this for some holiday cheer. Should've stuck with the egg nog and listen to Christmas CD's! Not a happy Edna!!
2,I didnt get it,I dont understand the purpose of this book.. I thought is would be a cute read - but I found myself wondering what the heck this was all about. Divas dont fake is terribly written - instead of a plot - thought it would be cute to swear. Princess in Training.. dragged and dragged.. I think this was just a way to try to impress us with all the traveling to exotic places and all the name brand clothes.. Who cares!! DONT WASTE your money - This Diva in training would rather be a door mat than follow these examples of what a woman should strive to be. These two getting a book deal makes me wonder what is wrong with the publishing world to publish this junk. I guess all of us should be thankful - there is a book to be published in all of us regardless how good it is.. someone will publish it...
3,"Fun, but don't expect a literary masterpiece....","I am fan of the Red Dress Ink line, and rate most of them at least 4 stars. However, this book just wasn't as good as the others. I bought it because I liked the fact that it was two books in one. It reminded me of those ""He said, She books"" I used to read as a preteen. But these are two totally different books, and I think that's the problem. Becase of the two book format, the stories were short. The characters felt undeveloped. Too much drama in a small book just seems a little overwhelming. I felt as if I need more information and reasoning to why the two female characters acted the way they did.I loved Erica Orloff's Spanish Disco (also Red Dress Ink) and this book just didn't measure up."
3,Good Book,My seven year old really likes this book. We have read it to her several times and she just renewed it from the library.
1,DONT BUY THIS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Dont buy this!!!..unless you are under the age of 10!!!!!!..this pack is very,very small..not at all as it is described!..worse yet the seller gives you nembers to call and one number is out of order..they other does not answer!!!!!..so I am stuck with a pack I cannot use and I am out the purchase price!!!!!!!"
4,Great Sandals,These are great sandals that will allow me to use my custom made orthodics. I have not used them yet because the insoles that it comes with work so well.
5,The fellow's bible,"Great book. Many of the ""unpublished"" statements raise the concern as to the veracity and clinical relevance of these data. The old Friedman and Schamroth text though are very good and complement this text. I still prefer this text over the old Marriot's although I haven't read the new Marriot."
2,"I Wouldn't Call this ""Gourmet""!","I don't know how the Eastman Company can claim that this injector is ""gourmet""! They are just plain wrong. There is nothing ""gourmet"" about it. I bought one and maybe it could be called semi-epicurean but definitely NOT ""gourmet"". If you want something truly ""gourmet"" then I suggest getting the Basting Gun with Injector by Gourmac (Division of Hutzler Mfg. Co., Inc.. ). Now that's ""gourmet""!PS. Just in case you think I'm wrong, I asked my friend who is a chef at Macaroni Grill about this product and he said, ""malfouka, you're absolutely right. This is not 'gourmet'!"""
3,Garmin case,"A bit of a struggle to insert the GPS unit inside, but it does provide an extra level of protection for the unit, which is reassuring. Plastic does reduce the visibility slightly, but it is still easy to use and much easier to carry."
4,Gilsson GPS Carrying Case,"I'll reiterate comments from several other reviewers.It is a pretty nice case, but has some minor flaws. First, it is a very tight fit for my 76CSx. Somewhat of a struggle to get the GPS in the case. It does provide a clear view of the buttons and display. Second, I too worry about the seam where the window is sewn onto the fabric. Due to the tight fit, there is a lot of tension on the seam and one has to be extremely careful when trying to get the case to slide over the GPS. Third, a storage pouch for spare data cards would be great.With some minor tweaks this could be an excellent case. Will have to see how it holds up in use.LB"
5,Great cover even for smartphones,I use this case for over 3 years now and just recently purchased another one for a friend.We both use it on our MTB in hard off-road tracks.I have a HTC ONE S while he has the Samsung S2 and we both see it as compatible for the hard task.
3,Could have lasted longer,"Bought this cover for my 76csx in 3/2009. The carry loop broke in the first year but that was ok because I switched to using the caribiner plastic loop. Now, after 3+ years the stitching holding the carbiner loop has come undone.Re: Other commentsThe cover has always fit well during the 3+ years of use. In particular the stitching around the transparent part of the cover has never been a problem.I agree the caribiner loop is on the wrong end."
3,minor zombie novel,"This is as much a political novel about the attempt to overthrow the dictatorship of a Caribbean country as it is a novel about zombies and voodoo. An American writer visiting the country of San Marlo becomes caught up in a revolutionary movement to overthrown the repressive government, which carries out killings and kidnappings with the help of a zombie army. While it is a decent read, there really aren't enough details about politics or voodoo to make this novel special. Recommended for those who don't like their horror novels with gallons of gore."
4,"Solid Up To Date Information, tho not too much new info here","A good overview for new agents, full of forms, prospecting ideas, organizational tips, marketing ideas, as well as computer and technology tips. It gives simple basics for dialogues, ads, listings, tools of the trade, closings, farming, mailers, and prospecting. My only complaint is that is simplifies some processes .... for example FSBO's. ""Every Sunday, FSBO's wait to be called by agents"". Yeah right! But overall, there is a good bit of information on almost every subject here, most are covered very well, though from a pretty basic standpoint. Recommended for new agents, or agents in a lull. The forms are excellent, better than the Carla Cross books (tho they are great in other ways!). This one book does cover subjects you might have to buy 5 or 6 others in the field to get. Very helpful resource. Try also Carla Cross, Dirk Zeller, Bob Boog, or Danielle Kennedy. Recommended by NAR."
3,Not bad.....,"As one VERY interested in Welsh lore I was more than excited to read this book. There were a few times when I found myself disputing versions of tales, but all in all this wasn't a bad read at all. My main complaint was with the book's binding - I always had the feeling if I'd opened the book another 1/2 inch I'd break the binding completely! I'd still be interested in reading more - I suppose that'd be my last complaint...that it was too darn short!"
4,Great Cooking gloves,"Great Product and are certainly classified in the heavy duty category. I run a large smoker up to 12 times a year and these have not dissapointed. I like these, but some users might think they are a bit too long."
4,"Can't agree with all of it, but well written and witty","Conor Cunningham is FAR easier to read that Milbank and other folks involved in Radical Orthodoxy. Often times, their (RO) interpretation of the history of philosophy is kind of confusing... it usually in different books and essays. This book, however, makes sense of all of it. Radical Orthodoxy and participation makes more sense after book than anything else I've read.I believe, however, his historiography is off at moments. The conclusions of a thinker in the future do not equate to the negativity of said thinker... once can't say Plato or Aristotle is a cleaner philosophical construct than others. I think this is a bit inconsistent. Not to say that Cunningham doesn't have an answer, I just dont recall seeing it here.either way, great read. Hard, but worth it... Cunningham writes with wit and teeth. There are moments where it's similar to poetry."
1,Marc Newson design,"Yes the barrel does fit in the hand nicely-but it is necessary to turn the curling iron""easily"" when using it. It seems to be obvious, that Marc has never used a curling iron. This is the worst design I have ever seen, and do not recommend it."
2,"No plot, just philosophy","I got halfway through the book before giving up on it. If you want to read different philosophies of scientific direction and human behavior, this is the book for you. If you want to actually read a story that might entertain, look elsewhere. Boring."
1,Tough to read...,"Ok, I'm not actually done with the book, but even as an avid reader, I found it hard to get started with this book. The most annoying thing is his style of writing everything in the present tense. (example: She SAYS, "" How are you doing?"", instead of She SAID, ""How are you doing""? He WALKS to the curb, instead of He WALKED to the curb.) A fine point, to be sure, but YOU try reading like that for hundreds of pages. If it doesn't grab me in the next fifty, I'm done.UPDATE: I actually did finish, but wish I'd given up like I said I would. The pacing stinks, the charaters are launched around from location to location seemingly at random intervals, and that lousy use of tenses continued to bug me. Unless you are a hardcore fan of this writer and his style, I would avoid it like grim death."
2,"Interesting science, terrible characters","Having read - and thoroughly enjoyed - the Confluence trilogy, I picked up Secret of Life without even scanning it. Had I peeked,I would have realized that it's the type of sci-fi I have particular trouble with - where the science and technology are the real protagonists, not the human characters (or alien/ artificial intelligences).The characters are 2-dimensional and largely unpleasant. As a woman, I found the main character Mariella particularly unpalatable (the book reviewer above must have been a man) - a generally unpleasant arrogant individual who's a man's vision of a 'liberated' woman (she mechanically has sex with anyone she meets in a bar, in every other chapter). Ugh.To enjoy a book, a reader must identify with someone in it. The science is interesting - but I find I just can't finish this one."
2,Lost In Space,"A real plodder. Too much ""2d human values"" vs spirited Joan of Arc stuff. Not enough wow/insight/future-shock/smart-tech. I actually disliked the heroine and felt empathy with the ultra-rad-greens. If only they'd wiped out humanity before this book was written.Suffers acute plot failure, the whole section on return to Earth was too improbable.Read Fairyland if nothing else, some of whom's characters appear later in this dreary book."
5,Great structure,"I bought the Walthers Glacier Gravel Co to add to my HO scale gravel operation. The model assembles easily and looks good on the layout. The open interior made it easy to add interior lighting as well. As a note, if adding interior lights then the light will show thru the walls so it is best to paint the interior and exterior of the structure to block the light from showing thru the walls."
4,HO modeler,Very good model. Instructions clear and helpful.Desired some painting and fit my 4x8 ho layout fine.Only problem was the cost.Price was raised too much.Over priced.
5,a nice addition to the collection,"I like Bear Grylls so this was a nice addition to my collection. If you enjoyed the tv show, you should get the DVDs. They come with a few extras that are worth getting."
3,dissapointed,"i luv this guy and his show, however, there was only 4 episodes in the first disc. the second disc had all episodes that ive seen b4, on the other seasons discs. i felt bad after that :("
5,Great movies!,"I won't review the movies, other than to say they are fantastic. The blu-ray's have excellent picture and sound, so that makes them that much more enjoyable."
3,Great movies! Not such a great set...,"I got this because it was a great price, considering Ultimatum had just been released and it was only a little bit more for the set than I expected(rather than just buying ultimatum). I already had the first two films and was looking forward to the bonus disc. It was pretty dissapointing and not worth it. The cover box is nice but dents and scratches easily. The bonus disc is just 3 interview type shorts. I would have rather gone with the bestbuy exclusive edition which is supposed to have a metal case and bonus features that sound more interesting. This is a good set if you don't already have the movies, but the bonus disc is just a bonus disc and nothing special or something to look forward to. I don't know if its just me, but weren't these interviews already on the movies special features anyway? hmm maybe its an extention of the interview. Pretty boring either way."
3,BEWARE!,"I bought the Bourne trilogy on DVD for my roomates birthday. Unbeknownst to me they were HD DVD's that don't work on a regular DVD player. IT SHOULD SAY SOMETHING ABOUT THIS FACT ON THE PRODUCT LISTING. Now we have this nice DVD set that we can't watch. Not only that but when he put the HD DVD into the Xbox 360 to watch it, IT BROKE THE XBOX! So in summary I have 3 movies I can't watch and $500 video game system that is broken. Thanks Amazon."
5,Good gets better.,Had these on DVD and loved them. Good gets better on Blue Ray. Matt in Blue Ray!! Enough said.
3,sean,"Jason Bourne rocks, however this HD-DVD format was dead so I have this Trilogy for nothing, can't watch now."
5,Bourne Collection,"Bought this as a gift, but I own the DVDs individually. I don't watch many movies, but my husband got me hooked on these DVDs. This is a great series for anyone wanting suspense & action."
4,Only because it took so long...,"I mean no offense to the movies or the franchise for that matter. But, it took Universal Studios way too long to get there stuff together and finally get this put out on Blu-ray. While I do understand the whole HDDVD vs Blu-ray war was a tough pill for many studios to swallow, once the dust settled and Blu-ray was it going forward, I still do not get why they did not get this out on Blu-ray in time for the holidays at the end of 2008??? Obviously the diehard Bourne fans and action addicts will come out in droves to pick this up, but I am really disappointed from a consumer standpoint that it was hard for them to see why getting this out there was a priority.The 4 stars is only for frustration with a mega-company taking too long to put out something the fans and the consumers alike love. Great movies, clean transfer to Blu-ray and enough extras to keep us interested in Bourne for years to come."
5,Bourne takes on Bond,Bourne takes on Bond and in some ways wins Great action movies that will make any movie lover very happy to add to his collection the new bond for the 21st cantury
1,Be careful,Mine came through as defective. The final had a problem and would not play the last scene. I did order the HD edition.Bummer Amazon has promised me a replacement but dang it to get to the end and not know what happened. Give me a break :)Now have to hope Amazon stands behind it and does send me a return lable and also replaces the product.
3,Eh...,It must be just me but Ive tried to get into these movies and they just dont do it for me. I know people love them but to me they just arent that good.
3,Shaky Cam Killed the Action Scenes,"I would give the Trilogy five stars if not for the nauseating shaky cam during the fight and car chase scenes. It absolutely ruins the choreography. The shaking in the first movie is tolerable but in the last two it was chaotic. You don't know who's hitting or chasing who. You don't need to shake the camera so much or change scenes so fast to make the action more exciting. The car chase scene in ""The French Connection"" was a classic but it didn't use a shaky cam."
2,The Jason Bourne Collection DVD box set,I had to return it because Ultimatum was damaged. The last third of the movie was not playing properly. I returned the DVD box set on 01-04-08 and now news from Amazon yet...
3,"High-res, but grainy","Great movies, but not the highest-quality blu-ray. The film is fairly grainy, especially in low-light scenes. From a moderate distance it isn't too noticeable though."
2,Bourne Trilogy,"As each movie came out in theatres, I made sure to go see them ASAP, and they all rocked! But when I deployed to Iraq my best friend sent me the books. I could not put them down, in any free time I could find my nose was buried in the pages. After the books were complete I got the movies to watch again and wow. My perspective totally changed...for the worse. The movies were not based on the books at all Except the main characters name was Jason Bourne. The movies had incredibly weak plots compared to what the author Robert Ludlum wrote. Even other critical characters were completely left out of the films! If you liked the movies BUY THE BOOKS! If you read the series, do not even rent the DVD's."
3,1st movie freezes my BD player up,"I really like the movies, and the sound track. The audio codec's are great but Bourne Identity does not play on my Sony BDP-590. The Bourne Identity freezes up the machine to the point that I have to unplug it and wait for a few seconds and then plug it back in to get the player unfrozen. The other movies play great, but with this issue I'm going to research and see if there is another release. I don't say if other BD players are having the same issue, but after two sets I'm done for now.Over all I was really dissapointed that the Bourne Identity stopped at the same place in both box sets, and had to return them both, but I'm giving the set three stars because of the way Amazon handled the issue by issuing a full refund with paid UPS pick up."
4,Good Trilogy,"This is a must have Trilogy set for Bourne fans. All three movies are entertaining with non-stop action. Story line is very good and links all three movies together nicely.The image quality of the movies are good, but not great for Blu-Ray. Sound is excellent! There are tons of extras and control features with these BD discs. The box set design is very nice also. Overall, it's worth to have in your collection."
4,pay attention,This product is what I ordered. Delivered promptly and in good condition. The only thing is now with sooo many choices of formats and screen sizes you must take care in ordering to get what you really want. I actually bought this with the intention of watching it on the airplane but shows only in 16:9 format.
5,The Bourne Trilogy,"Personally I believe HD DVD's are absolutely the best way to see a movie at home. This series ""The Bourne Trilogy"" is fantastic. Hopefully in the future many new HD DVD's will be available."
4,Action and Fun,The Bourne movies are so much better watched in sequence. This collection comes in a stylish box and has a lot of interesting bonus features for not a lot of money. One has a psychologist explaining the science behind Bourne's memory loss.
5,Jason and I,"I was delighted that Jason and I were reunited. This provider gave me excellent service. Quick, no nonsense. Delivered as promised in excellent condition. Would certainly use again."
5,Great movies,We absolutely loved the movies. They came very quickly and in great shape. We were able to watch all of them in succession and ejoyed 3 nights of great movies.
3,The Ultimate Bourne,"I liked Matt Damon better... I think it should have been placed somewhere else. It,s okay but I still like Matt Damon"
4,"The Bourne Trilogy, a ""Keeper""","My husband and I saw one of the Bourne movies on TV and we both liked it enough to want to see the entire trilogy. Buying ""used but good condition"" DVD's makes it possible to have a larger collection of movies without hurting our budget. The movies are edge of the seat exciting. The acting is great and the chases and twists and turns in the story keep you hoping that good will win out over bad."
5,great movies look great too,I have been a fan of this series since they started rolling out in theaters and bought this set to replace my DVDs. The trillogy looks great and it was well worth the money for the upgrade.
4,matt damon's last hurrah,"these are some great movies; matt damon hadn't gone all hugo chavez on us yet. however i found the sound quality to be lacking, sadly. 4.5 stars if i could."
5,MUST OWN TRILOGY,"This is perhaps the second best trilogy in all of movie land. Jason Bourne (Born homonym) is an assassin who has developed amnesia. He attempts to find out who he is while fighting off people trying to kill him. Eventually he will discover he doesn't like who he is. While he has forgotten who he is, he does remember how to stunt drive a car, shoot all kinds of weapons and knows a heap about technology and is perhaps the only fictional non-super hero who could whoop Uma Thurman in Kill Bill. He is Rambo with an IQ. And like all fictional heroes he is the only person in the world who can kill with one shot, while no one else can shoot straight.What is nice about the trilogy is that the movies mesh very well and get better as they go along. Like LOTR it has one climax scene after another. This is a thinking man's action-drama."
4,The Bourne Trilogy,I have seen these movies in the movie house.The movies were very exciting and theme was acceptable for most teens and adults. I have not reviewed the videos since I bought them as a Christmas present for someone
2,Can't play on regular dvd player,"I was excited to get the trilogy for my son, but when he opened it Christmas morning, he couldn't play it on his dvd player. Until we get an hd dvd player, we will not be able to watch them..."
2,If your read the books...,"...and liked them, the movies are a real tour de farce. There is almost nothing in common. I guess Mr. Ludlum fell victim to the smell of money and making anything remotely connected to the book would have required a different type imagination on the part of the producers and directors."
3,HD DVD doesn't work with Blu Ray,"Unfortunately, I didn't know that the Blu Ray HD - DVD compatability issue was similar the VHS - Betamax competition years ago, so I bought this trilogy in the wrong format for my finance and it doesn't work as hoped in our Playstation3. Bummer."
2,The Bourne Trilogy DVD,"We received our order of the Bourne Trilogy just in time for Christmas. We were very dismayed, however, when we tried to watch our new DVD's and couldn't because we weren't aware that you can only watch an HD DVD on an HD DVD player. When we ordered the Bourne Trilogy, we didn't realize that we were purchasing them as HD's. Perhaps you should be more specific in your descriptions of the items, as we weren't able to watch the first two movies. We were able to watch The Bourne Ultimatum because it was a regular DVD on one side and HD on the other. We spent $50 on this set so it was a big expense for one movie."
2,"Misleading Package ""set""","I wanted to buy this set for my husband for Christmas. It was not clear that the first two discs in the set were a different format from the third in the series, especially if you're not into all the high-tech geek stuff. The first two discs require an entirely separate DVD Player. All three discs should have been the same format if it comes in a set. As a result, we are only able to play the 3rd disc, Bourne Ultimatum, unless of course we want to spend another small fortune on a new player."
5,Three great movies!,"For those that loved any of the Bourne movies, this is a must have if you don't own any. The bonus disc is great!"
2,The Bourne Identity was poor,"The First film ""The Bourne Identity"" was 3 seconds behind the lip movement. The other two were excellent. Dave Barry"
4,Xmas gift,"This was cheaper than the shops, even with postage. And it was exactly as its described. Also, the code matched my DVD player"
4,bourne trilogy,"Cool. They look great in HD. I actually preordered the trilogy before I had an HDDVD player (I now have the Xbox 360 add-on) Since Ultimatum was in HD and standard DVD I was worth the upgrade to get them all.They look amazing on my 42"" 1008p LCD. Shipping was a little late, but I guess you can expect that from a preorder. (3 or 4 days after the ""expected"" ship date)"
1,THESE DVD'S DO NOT WORK...,"I ordered this boxed set of Blueray dvd's in November of 2011 as a Christmas present for my husband. Unfortunately, we never opened them to play until March 1, 2013. When we tried to play them, we got an ""unavailable"" screen on our dvd player. At first, we thought we weren't loading them correctly, or there was an issue with the dvd player, but other dvd's are working fine. I'm very disappointed that we didn't try them as soon as we got them, so they could have been returned. I guess we will use them as a paperweight..."
5,Recommend,"Excellent movies for those who like drama, suspense, and intrigue. Awesome that all three came together. Highly recommend. Great gift."
5,MATTTT DAAAAAAAMONNNN,"Love these movies. I especially like watching them in reverse order so it's a movie about a guy who knows who he is, but slowly forgets......"
1,Bourne Trilogy,"Very worse Movie of the three, was the last......B/Ulimatum--- a collection of non-associated garbage---------First 2 where great----John S."
5,Bought too soon,"Now that HD-DVD will no longer be available, I bought this collection too soon. Wait for the HD-DVD fire sales to begin."
3,Bourne American region :(,Love the movies but very annoying to re-code and burn to enable play on Australian DVD Player :(Had to use DVD Fab as DVD Shrink 3.2 did not compress disc 2 or 3If selling internationally please either sell as Region free or in the Region your are posting to.Or make it very obvious that they are Region 1 discs.
3,Great stories,"The story of each are amazing, quality of the first 2 movies were not the best though. Some scenes were a little blurry and some scenes seemed like it was in fast-forward when it was not. Maybe they were rushed onto this blu-ray package or the films did not transfer well onto it."
4,Nice box - Great movies!,"Overall I'm happy with my purchase. I told myself as soon as they released the Bourne box set I was going to buy it...and preorder it I did. It would have been nice if the bonus CD was more robust but still, the movies are awesome, the collector box is cool and I have what I believe to be one of the best, most consistent film trilogies available, in my collection."
5,Good Blu Ray combo!,"Its a great trilogy and a great box set. What else do you need? Blu rays work well, decent menu options/animations, got a good deal."
4,Great series,"My family has really enjoyed this series. Well written and acted, you hit the ground running from the moment it starts."
5,One of the best action trilogy!,"You cannot go wrong buying this set. The set comes with 3 thin DVD jackets, no booklets but you have the bonus features you would find if you bought each individual DVD. Always a pleasure to watch and rewatch"
4,"Good series, ...","This series is a fantastic story of the life (and pre-life) of our antagonist, Jason Bourne. While the action is top notch, and the acting superb, i would have liked to see LESS camera jitter. It's simply all over the place. The series on HD definetely looks good, though would have been crisper if it wasn't shot like it was. I understand it was done that way to, you know, intesify thing. it's just my personal opinion that the actual picture quality does suffer for that. I digress....the actual movies are awesome. buy them if you like action, and suspense and james bond-esque themed movies.online content suffers as well, as you must create an account for the third installment's features, which takes exessive time. i had to give up after half an hour, and just watch the movie again. still, totally worth it."
4,Bourne Trilogy,"Bought this as a used set and have found no problems with it at all. No skips, scratches or bumps. Having a Bourne Trilogy get together at my house next weekend!"
5,Bourne is simply the best,The sound and picture quality of this blu-ray set is superb. Its a must buy to anyone who wishes to get the best out of their home theater system.
5,Bourne Trilogy,"After spending a considerable amount of time trying to view all three of these masterpieces, it is wonderful being able to watch them in sequence. We look forward to the next addition to the series.blu-ray"
4,LOVE THE TRILOGY!!,"Chock full of extras, the Bourne trilogy is the collection to own if you like action or Matt Damon. Smartly written with nonstop suspense, these are three of my top ten favorite action films of all time. The Blu-ray collection is packed with the usual commentaries and deleted scenes and also contains interview and clips on what the actors went through training for this movie such as driving and an in depth look into the fight scenes. If you've been holding out on purchasing the trilogy, this is the set you've been waiting for."
2,The Bourne Triligy,"I am certain that almost 50% of all three segments were violent car chases/collisions....it just goes on and on. Matt Damon deserved a better base for his outstanding talent. This was a big disappointment I was, of course, familiar with the plot and expected a really fine production. Viewing this trilogy again will take a really cold day!"
1,Bait and switch,"We love the Bourne series. However we are not quite current with our DVD technology, so Standard format is all we can view. The main title for this trilogy is dual format, but the older titles are HD-DVD only, which makes them unwatchable for us."
5,sonic redelivery of dvd vhs player,sonic via amazon resent me a new magnovox vhs/dvd player. i am 100% happy. pete glasheen
5,Get it as soon as you can,"This along with Die Hard and Lethal Weapon are the only Trilogy's that I would buy again in Blue Ray. All Three movies have it all. Action, suspense, bad guys who need punishing and a love story. Damon is a very good actor that delievers in spades. I will not belabour this but again all three movies are excellent."
4,Borne movies,"These movies are like the James Bond movies...action packed, with lots of running car chases, fighting and the good guy wins and get the girl!"
5,Very happy,The item arrived in two days. The packaging was in pristine condition and was very unique which surprised and delighted me. The item was in excellent condition and exactly what I was expecting and more. I would most definitely purchase from this seller again and would strongly recommend them to other people
2,Bourne Trilogy boxed set isn't the best value,"I just received my Bourne Trilogy Blu-ray boxed set from Amazon - it too exactly 2 weeks to reach Singapore by surface mail which isn't too bad. I should have looked closer at the invoice upon checking out the item as it is currently going for $65.99 so it works out to $21.99 per title. However, if you buy all three Bourne movies separately on Blu-ray, Amazon will make you a deal for $47.97. What's the point in buying the boxed set?"
2,Blu-ray?,"Don't buy the Blu-ray copy of these movies! They were not originally filmed in digital so the blu-ray copies look the same as the normal dvd copies. Sad to say, these blu-rays look worse than alot of my normal dvds. Great movies though. Get the dvds for sure!"
1,WATCH OUT,"This is for HIGH DEF DVD players only. If you are not up on the latest technology like me, then you may not realize till you try to use these that they will not work in your ""Old fashion"" DVD player.It seems that not all DVD's work in all DVD players any more. Wasted the price of these till I break down and buy a new player and TV.WHAT A RIP OFF FROM THE ELECTRONICS WORLD."
1,Movie #1 missing for some reason....,"I love the Bourne movies, and when I finally bought the trilogy I was excited to get them in this particular packaging, which is small and kind of cool-looking.The reason for one star and the disappointment? ==>MOVIE #1 WAS MISSING. Ultimatum and Supremacy were there in their pretty packages, but Identity was gone. Packaging looked intact, and everything normal otherwise. Then, no way on the Amazon site to notify someone of this. The only option I found? Trying to return the product for a refund and ordering again. Too much hassle."
4,Good Product,"I put 4 stars because I don`t like the package of the product, the box is weak and I think that Bournes Trilogy deserves a better envelope. About the quality of movies, is excellent, widescreen format, and have English, Spanish and French subtitles and languages."
1,Not so good,There were 3 of these and only one worked...very upset...sent them back and got a refund with no problem...
3,No Blu-Ray,"the movies are great but you need to have this item available in Blu-ray dvd. hd-dvd is incompatible with my system. i should have known this obviously but when i went to look for it in blu-ray, it was not for sale."
1,epileptic cameraman,these movies wouldn't be bad if they weren't filmed by a cameraman having an epileptic seizure every time there was suppose to be action. I guess they do that because the actor can't do action scenes competently.
4,Bourne Trilogy,"Blah, blah, blah... although I will say that the first one is the best, the second one pretty good, and the final installment just ok. Yada, yada, yada.The Complete Glock Reference Guide - 3rd Edition 4th RevisionCrimson Trace Corporation CTC LASERGRIP Glock 17/"
4,Not too much to be Bourne,"3 great action flicks in a series for $20 in DVD format, with extras -what's not to like???????????? Buy them!!!"
3,BluRay snafu,"Disc 2 & 3 played very good. My only problem was disc #1 ""Bourne Identity"" which kept freezing up and had to unplug/plug back in BluRay player in order to eject disc. It is my favorite of the 3, so asked Amazon if they could replace that one disc with one that hopefully works as well as all the other BluRay DVDs I've purchased from them. Just a heads up to those interested in this excellent trilogy."
5,the trilogy that i was waiting for,this item is a must have...the bourne trilogy....awesome movies...unbelievable action....just got my trilogy pack yesterday and spent the entire night watching all three again...
3,The same movie over and over....,"The Bourne series is extremely well produced with Hollywood's elite level of craftsman no doubt and Matt Damon is solid in the role as Jason Bourne. But I have watched all three movies back to back twice now trying to figure out what all the hype was about and why these films were so hugely successful....and I guess it's the simple excuse for action through some of Europe's most beautiful cities and of course it's always fun to see some hero completely destroy a seemingly invincible system...but my gosh people....IT'S THE SAME MOVIE OVER AND OVER AGAIN!!!! I FEEL LIKE I'M TAKING CRAZY PILLS!!!! Yes if you have seen the first movie you have seen them all!!!! A show down with fists and kicks, a couple of shoot outs and a car chase....and yep some smug suit gets taken down for some reason...I don't know. Great action series done over and over and over again and from what I here this is going to be repeated in a fourth...."
4,still too expensive,"A very good movie in any format, anyway the blu ray price is just not encouraging"
1,Movies are THE BEST...don't be fooled by packaging...,"Seriously, don't be fooled. You get this ""Super Cool"" silver box and when you open it...all it is, is the 3 movies as if you bought them off the used rack shelf for $5 each. Seriously, it's a waste of time. Just buy them separately. This is so much to the point that each individually wrapped movie has tape on them where the security tag would usually go.The movies are THE BEST...but don't be fooled by this packaging. And the bonus material is a COMPLETE let down. There is so much they could have done...instead we get a documentary of the writer. It's interesting but still, I would have loved to see more on the stunts, Damon's acting, etc."
5,Great collection,Bought this collection for my husband as a surprise gift. We both love the Bourne movies. A must for movie lovers!
5,Excellent box set.,I agree with the other reviewer that said opening the box was a challenge. They should put a sticker on the front of the box.Quality was excellent. Picture was a bit better than the regular DVDs however the sound was much better.All three movies are extremely entertaining. Can't wait for Bourne #4.
4,love the series and the extras,"I bought this for my husband for Christmas, we love the series and it was a NEW experience watching it on Blu Ray. There are a lot of great extras. This was a GREAT VALUE! Thanks to Amazon"
4,$24.99 and oddly perfect,"The Old Country Roses pattern reminds me of Italian grandmas but somehow these napkin rings got me right in the gut. I can't explain it. Normally, the combination of that shade of pink with that shade of yellow would just make me crazy but somehow these overblown almosttchotchke yet COOL ceramics are just what my demure table needs. I got the bunny shakers as well. But that's enough. Amazon keeps including pieces from the collection in my Gold Box. Do they read our reviews, I wonder.These ceramic roses strongly resemble Chinese exports of the 1980s but the 1980s versions are much finer yet just as affordable. It's interesting how this skill transforms into something different as part of an English tableware collection. If the ""Royal Albert"" or Doulton labels were not attached but a Chinese label were on it, it wouldn't be considered in the same way.Made in China."
3,out of date and out of touch,"I took this book with me on my vacation to the southwest and I found it disappointing. The restaurants it suggested in Flagstaff were all quirky or trendy. Lake Havasu City is completely different from what they describe, as the major tourist section went bankrupt TWO YEARS AGO. It describes Las Vegas, but none of the natural and historic wonders so close to it like Valley of Fire State Park, which is filled with ancient petroglyphs, incredible scenery, and wildlife. It was somewhat useful, but I'd recommend getting it from the library just to get some ideas of places to go. Don't rely on it for comprehensive, up-to-date information."
4,A good overall guide,"This book is very nice, has lots of information about the entire Southwest area. However, I'm finding that if you're looking for lots of information on a specific area, this may not be the book. I think that being that it covers such a large area, there is less information on each place. I'm wishing now that I would've just purchased the Santa Fe, Taos, and Albuquerque book rather than the entire Southwest"
1,doesn't cut it,"Didn't work as well as expected, overgrowth was bad and still growing after application of brush-b-gon, so I went with a non selective agricultural herbicide instead and that did the trick."
3,A disappointing Ondine,"Although a competent dancer, Yoshida has none of the poetry of Margot Fonteyn's interpretation in the 1959 Czinner film version of this ballet. Yoshida is particularly disappointing in the Shadow Dance in the first act. Watson's performance as Palemon is more romantic than that of Michael Soames. However, the domineering, spiteful character of Berta is much more developed in the 1959 version. The music in this new version has been rearranged to substitue timpani for bongo drums, and the overall tempo is slower than in the 1959 version. To see this ballet as Frederick Ashton intended it, you should try to get ahold of a copy of the 1959 Czinner version."
5,UNDERSTANDING MOM,"I am buying children's books on autism so that my [...] son can read them. I want him to learn as much about autism as he can. He does not have autism but I do. ""the Autism Acceptance Book"" explains how this condition affects the way some people, with autism, brains work. I want him to learn how I think and why I act somewhat differently from other mothers. This book can explain in a younger version of how autism works. There are many children out there that have autism and my son I know has met a few of these kids but he probably doesn't know that they have autism all he knows is that they are different. This book and others like it will help children that don't have autism to better understand those who do have autism. My son has a mom and a friend with autism and that person is me."
5,Truly a Godsend!,"This is the kind of book I want to see more of for all ages. I wish I'd had this book when I was a child. It sensitively and intelligently describes autism. Children, neurotypical (NT) and on the autism spectrum alike will get a lot out of it. It is the voice of reason and acceptance. If you get no other book for young people about autism, be sure to get this one. It is truly a shining gem! I love it!"
5,Great for group and individual,I really like this book. I appreciate that it encourages the reader to find commonalities with a friend who has autism. It shows that people can be friends with those who have autism. I am an educator in my church and I plan to use this is children's small groups.
5,Good One,"I was holding off on purchasing this book as I was skeptic about it being worth it. Well, I am pleased with this book and believe any parent or guardian of children living with Autism should own this book and give it to any potential friend."
2,Not good...not good at all...,"I won't take much of your time here with a lengthy review that the book does not need. Two things. First, the story is amateurish and ill conceived/presented. Second, the editing is completely abysmal. Either English isn't the editors first language or they understood how bad the book was and said why bother. Either way, the spelling and grammar errors are outrageous."
5,Taft is back!,Dirgo does it again with another John Taft adventure. Will appeal to fans of Cussler and Clancy.
3,Kindle price way out of line,"The Kindle price for this book is $7.99. The large print hardbound is $4.99. The paperback is $0.73 from the publisher through Amazon. The paperback is also available from other sellers for $3.41. I'd pay $2.99 for a Kindle edition, but not $7.99. For that I could get the hardbound and paperback.... I like Dirgo's work and might look for a copy at the local library."
2,Started Off Good But Plummetted,"This lousy book started off with a decent premise, based quite accurately on research performed by electricity genius Nikola Tesla. But then, it got silly real fast. I abhor thrillers that are detached from reality. In this one, the protagonist, an agent for an American intelligence agency, pursues the mysterious drainage of electric power from the European grid. But then the book deteriorates. It reads like a comic book or a bad B movie. Things get preposterous. This is one of those books where the superspy is superman and everything just happens to be in place for him to save the world. In other words, a bunch of nonsense. The book has little depth and falls into the category of junk."
3,No Clive Cussler,"This is no Clive Cussler. The writing seemed amateurish and the plot implausible. Yes it was fast paced and exciting at times. But I have to say that teen readers, whom this should be targeted at, would probably love it. Needed work on the editing also."
3,Worried about safety,"I have two children-4 and 20 months. My concern with this product is that when they are playing inside the hideout and wrestling around one of them would fall against the wall of the hideout and end up tangled in the whole thing. Twice I had to ""rescue"" my toddler who was panicking before I finally took the whole thing down. I would not recommend setting this up if you have children under the age of 3 unless you can definitely keep them away from it."
5,Mind Boggling,A Fantastic Story!!! When I finished the book the characters dominated my thoughts for many days. I recommend it to anyone willing to laugh and cry. You won't put it down.
2,Christ's death and resurrection by natural causes.,"Kirk Kimball attempts to explain the events of Jesus' life, death and resurrection as natural, not supernatural. He relies on the gospel writers for most details but assumes that some of their reports are exaggerated.Jesus' death, for example, is a coma from which he recovers. Religious believers will find this book offensive because Kimball denies divine intervention. Skeptics like myself might find that he uses too much imagination to explain what might be fictional or metaphorical stories."
2,Worse than I expected,"I thought this book wad terrible at explaining programming. Its poorly formatted and unorganized and worst of all, it is boring. Plus it tells nothing about running Python on Mac through a pre-composed text document. I only give this book and extra star because it explained some useful vocabulary. I reccoment Mark Lutz's ""Learning Python."" Hope I helped."
3,Not really for the novice,"As a slightly experienced C programmer and a somewhat experienced Python programmer, I found this book useful. It described Python's features and at the same time put them in the larger context of what modern computer languages do. Like several other reviewers, however, I think the level of this book would be far too intimidating for someone learning to program for the first time. Also, for me the final section of the book (""Case Studies"") delved too deeply into object-oriented and GUI issues not directly relevant to my work, and I put the book aside at that point. Bottom line: a nice recap but not really for the novice."
4,Great book for the beginner!,"I really like this book. What a great book for a person with no programming and or scripting experience. I bought it for a friend, and he was able to pick up Python very quickly.The only cons are that the book lacks excercises. For a beginning programmer excercises are crucial. I would still use the book for a beginning programming and or scripting class though."
5,"Everything you always wanted to know, but were afraid to ask","So, I got a ton out of this book, as the last real programming I did was back in about 1992, in Pascal. Lots and lots have changed, and Python's a real easy transition to a modern language.One thing that could be improved about the book would be to make it IDE-specific, and teach how to use Eclipse or X-Code to develop a complete application, instead of focusing on the scripting.But that's minor - the book is a great (re-)introduction to getting a computer to do what you want it to do."
3,"Pretty good, but you'd better get the errata sheets","I've only made it through the first six chapters (out of 23), so I'm not ready to comment on the effectiveness of this book.One thing I can say is that it is rife with typos & errors from start to finish (many trivial, others serious)...."
3,"fills a niche, but not the ideal beginner's book","In some ways this book seems like it's in search of an identity. It's obviously intended for the novice, and its short chapters and general topics reflect that, but many things are left unexplained or explained poorly, such as the chapter on object-oriented programming. This book definitely fills a niche for introductory python books for an audience with no programming experience, and my frequent frustration has not necessarily outweighed the value of the short chapters on diverse topics. Part of the problem may be that Amazon sold me a copy of the 1st edition rather than the 2nd. I'm going to finish the book soon and print out the Python tutorial to see if that can answer some unanswered questions."
5,Great product,Works well with three kids. We also have a three person flat tube but littler kids really like this one since it really does help hold the on cover seems really nice and strong. I also like the strength of the front connection. You should purchase a quick connect for the front.
2,50% failure rate,"I used the dough recipe on the box, and half of the cookies swelled so much that the slots were too small for the cookies to go together."
2,3D cookie cutters,"These cookie cutters are sturdy and well-made; however, the dough could not be easily removed from the cutter. Maybe, I just need more practice."
2,3D cookie cutters - Good idea - BAD in performance,These sounded nice. The problem with these cutters is that they do not release the dough very well. This causes the cookie dough to break or warp. I followed all directions and I am a season baked of 40 years. I loved the idea of 3D cookies but these fall far short of useable. I have seen other cutter that use a plunger and if Nordic were to do this then I think they would have a winner.
3,"Still pretty good, but v-e-e-e-r-y slow","After reaching the midpoint of the book I was wondering just what had happened. When I added it all up, it didn't come to very much. Sure Ian is attracted to Torrie's mom, but do you have to tell me over and over and over again? And do we really need *all* those 4-letter expletives which don't add much to either the dialogue or the mood? I'll buy and read the 3rd in the series, but I certainly hope that Rosenberg picks up the pace a little, and that we don't have a repeat of the downhill spiral we saw in his Guardians of the Flame series."
3,Preparing the way for the really exciting stuff.,"The book focuses on secret agendasand emotional manipulation to achievethem. Tory's mother, Ian's father, Odin andvarious other characters.We learn more about Ian's background anddetails about his relationship with his fatherand his difficulties after leaving home, which isinteresting. The action is very limitedcompared to The Fire Duke, things move slowlyand few conclusions are reached. The wholebook feels like it is setting the stage forthe next book. It feels like Joel is trying towrite a much deeper more psychological bookthan his usual style, but it also feels like he'spacking all of it in early so he can get it out of the way.I think he should have spread it out more and related itmore closely to the progression in the plot. The plotwould have proceeded much more quickly that way.Not a bad book. I'm sure I'll buy next one,but I was hoping for more.gary hayenga"
5,Like a mini-MBA,"Another winner from Brian Tracy. Each chapter looks at a different aspect of running a business (see the table of contents and you'll understand what I mean), giving solid advice and intelligent answers. A good read for any entrepreneur, or in fact anyone involved in enhancing the success of a business."
4,Brian Tracy is solid again,Brian Tracy is a guy who has a way of simplifying complex issues and in this small business guide he does it again. It is an easy read and one packed with some simple yet powerful ideas. If youre looking for business ideas to take your business to the next level then this is a good start. Worth the read and then some
3,"Fun, but wish it had more phosphorescent sheets","This is pretty cool, but I wish there was a little more to it.Yes, it does need to be very dark - but then, the kids think it is cool to sit in the closet... that actually might be its biggest allure.The kids ask to do it all the time, but there are only 2 phosphorescent sheets. So, it takes them all of 3 minutes per sheet to draw a picture, and then you need to wait for the glow to disappear before you can draw more... so, it is a short lived thing."
3,"Quick review, pre-interview","Didn't find a lot of new info here, but do findBoost Your Interview IQa useful quick read the night before an interview."
5,Read this before your behavioral interview,"This book was superb. It specifically addresses traditional interviews and then behavioral interviews. It clearly gives you 50 questions to expect and the great, so-so and poor responses. The ROI on this book for the interviewee has to be very high."
3,"Nice, but pricey","Really nice product, but a little pricey (I thought it would last in the bottle longer than regular polish). It does last well on your nails - about 7-10 days. I'm replacing it with drugstore brand for comparison."
5,What ever I feel like i wanna take photos of. Gosh.,"I used this book as a text book during a digital photography class at Rice University. It guides you from very basic information about both photography and digital photography, through very advanced techniques for getting the most out of your camera and images. I highly recommend it for anyone who wants begin, or improve their digital photography and photoshop skills. afterall, everyone know that girls only like guys with skills.photoshop skills, photography skills...."
5,Real World Digital Photography (2nd Edition),Great for beginning photographers! It even talks about budget considerations. It gives all the basics you need to know. Easy to read and understand.
1,bad product,"The product is very bad. From the first game did, the material began to emerge from the palm of your hand .... to this date, I have 6 games and are already in very bad conditions ... were $ 35 down the drain ... no buy it ..."
4,"Things that make you go, ""hmmm...""","Lightman's novel is eerily thought provoking. Throughout this day to day perspective of the different contexts of time, Lightman creates multiple worlds, each more different than the previous. It is difficult, upon completion of the novel, to not pick a favorite and least favorite scenario. However, each new picture that Lightman paints is beautiful in its own unique way.What this book lacks in quantity, as the old adage goes, it makes up for in quality. A quick read to be sure, Lightman's novel is perfect for someone who doesn't mind spending a little time reflecting on what they have just read."
5,Suppose Time is a Circle....,"This is a gem of a little book! I read it for my philosophy of physics course and I really enjoyed it. It depicts thirty or so of Einstein's ""dreams"" about what the nature of time might really be. Each dream is only a couple of pages long and it is beautifully and lyrically written. Don't be put off by the subject matter - this is not a physics book and there is nothing technical about it; no history or knowledge of science or mathematics is required. If fact, there is very little mention of Einstein at all. Mostly it just describes what life in Bern would be like if time was a circle, or if the concept of future didn't exist, or if the length of time varied from town to town. The novel the perfect length: long enough for Lightman to make his point, but short enough that it is not boring or repetitive. This is not to be missed. You can finish it in an hour and you won't be disappointed."
3,"Very good, but not great","Lightman's book is an enjoyable read, but not the most inspired or enlightening. It makes for an enjoyable bed-time story, but seems to lack a certain edge (partially due to the author's style of writing, and partially to content). Often you know exactly where the story will lead from the beginning, and the path there is not that exciting in and of itself. A great concept, unfortunately not done justice."
3,MIND EXPANDING,"This thought provoking book is exercise for the intellect and imagination. Various theories arise on the aspect of time and you are coaxed with lovely writing to ponder those theories. I found myself smiling at some, relating deeply to others, and finding my sense of time among the pages. Various chapters reminded me of movies I had seen; ""Groundhog Day"" and Peggy Sue Got Married,"" and ""Sliding Doors."" Alan Lightman must not be the first to ponder the thoughts of Einstein's dreams.Though it was unique and beautifully written, I cannot say, ""Everyone buy this; you must."" The prose is striking; the thoughts presented interesting; I just didn't happen to find it a great use of my reading time, and that is time I value above all!!"
5,all went smoothly,"I sent this to my brother in law for Xmas, and he said he enjoyed it. It was awkward establishing the address for the gift, since the billing was set up for everything to come to my address from Amazon. This could be improved in my opinion."
5,enchanting!,"I absolutely love this book. It is beautifully written, poetic prose. His descriptions are gentle and so compelling, he takes me into the worlds he's desribing, with tastes, textures, sights, sounds, emotion. Unlike a lot of people it took me a while to read the book. I kept it in my bathroom and read one chapter at a time. This gave me a chance to wrap my mind around what he was talking about. My own thoughts and concept of the universe have expanded and opened for new thought on the subject. Amazing."
5,Amazing,"The title alone intrigued me, and the content of this amazing novel is a piece of work. It starts out with a fictional account of a day in the life of Albert Einstein and the successive chapters give light to dreams he has, with a chapter here and there pulling the reader back into the ""real time"" of the same day. Lightman must have done some extensive research into Einstein and his theories because I found that most of the chapters (dreams) featured a different kind of world in which time acted differently, representing the vast array of Einstein's thoughts regarding the properties of time. I finished the book in one night and recommend it to anyone who finds the concept of time interesting."
4,Incredibly Intelligent,"I can't believe that I liked a book that is made up of a measly 30 little thoughts, but I did. Alan Lightman re-creates the dreams that inspired Einstein's theory of relativity. Each little section touches on one of his special theories, and each one of them with their own odd psychology. An easy read, that discuss things in a light hearted way. This book pushes the mind to think beyond the boundaries....A must read!"
5,An unforgettable journey through reality and beyond,"Just what is Time? What is reality? Through the dreams of Lightman's recreation of Einstein, we are shown scores of philosophical possibilities, that are not quite reality, but not quite fantasy either.Every chapter portrays a new world, a new reality, a new definition of time and space as dreamed up by the young pattent clerk on the verge of the major discovery of the Theory of Relativity. Each journey into Einstein's imagination show the reader just how similar these fantasies can be to what we perceive as reality.It is impossible to read this book without imagining yourself as a character in each of these different realities, feeling as they feel, thinking as they think. Einstein's Dreams is a very quick read, but it leaves a lasting impression in your very soul. It goes to prove that big things still come in small packages."
3,Pulling... but the conclusion...,"This book is a good readind and way to explain science with simple but strong words, I would have like a Dialog between Einstein and ""The Great One"" but this never happen. I enjoyed more ""Dance for Two"" this one although fascinating, left me with a sense of ""incomplete"", non defining. Maybe like a dream, then It was probably what he intended... to leave the door open..."
2,"Interesting concepts of time, and how to waste it.","Once I got the idea of the book, a collection of 4 page episodes describing the effect of different time continuums on human behavior, I lost interest. Unfortunatly, these behavioral questions are not given a depth of description that allows one to be interested in a plot or a character. Perhaps instead of many short overviews, a couple of longer chapters would have given a more rich and real view of the relationship between human behavior and the element of time. Nothing new on alternate time theories for a science fiction fan. I would recommend reading a couple of randomly selected chapters, but more than that sees just repetitions with slight twists (not very interesting twists, at that). Perfect book for a waiting room table. Definately not poetry, either."
3,Wanted to Like the Book More,"As I understand it, Lightman, a physics professor at MIT, is trying to examine one of Einstein's achievements -- his ideas about time -- in human terms. To do so, he presents little vignettes that represent what life would be like if there were no time, time stood still, there were two simultaneous measures of time, time was fixed by an obsession with the past, and so on. I think his idea is intriguing but the execution is not satisfying, largely because the vignettes are static and abstract -- at least to my taste -- and eventually become irritating to read. This is a small book, not much more than a pamphlet really, but its parade of images finally felt endless. It's like Walt Whitman writing carefully, conscientiously, but without emotional connection to humankind."
4,"Very entertaining, easy read","This is a great little collection of quick vignettes on the nature of time in alternate realities, as seen in the ""dreams"" of a young Einstein who is trying to see the world in ways never before seen.It's a quick read, but entertaining and generally engaging. No physics knowledge (or even interest, really) necessary."
4,A Focused Collection of Fictional Essays,"Very stimulating book that illuminates the mysteries of time and our attempts to make sense of it. It is written in a style that is accessible and entertaining. Not quite a novel, not quite a collection of short stories, perhaps it could best be summarized as a focused collection of fictional essays. In any event, it is a book well worth reading."
5,Amazing read,"What an amazing read...time, something in day-to-day life we never think about, influences every aspect of our lives, our psychology, our relationships. In this book, during each chapter time functions differently (each is a dream of Einstein's), and so people are almost alien. They suffer and love in their worlds in ways to which we can relate, however, all the same.It's written in prose, but it leaves one with the feeling of poetry - a somber, but thoughtful heightened awareness of what's truly magical about our existence, but often hidden in plain sight.Highly recommended. Read it in a cafe while drinking espresso or having bread and cheese, the European feel/imagery will truly come alive!"
5,How do you take yours?,"Heavy themes for a relatively petite-looking piece of literature. Small joys captured in the big scheme of things. See why time has the possibility of flight or slow eternity.Even if not choosing to take the ethereal view of temporal sands, chunks and flows, still to be admired is the perspective of Einstein. In Lightman's capture, dare to wonder how such a brain begins to ponder the place and meaning of each person on Earth. The simple bones of a story, an outlined but ordinary existence, stand in contrast to the airy physics forced into imagination.Any way you wish it, from whatever place it pulls you to read Einstein's Dreams, prepare to be thoroughly impressed, if not feeling as though politely poked back into awareness of time and space."
2,wholly unimpressed,"if it werent for the interlude on page 51, i would have put the book down and stopped there. inspired to read this book by the subject and further influenced by the fantastic reviews. i was expecting a wonderful adventure of the mind. instead, i lost 8.99 that would have been better spent at the movies. while certainly fine if on an airplane, train, or bus, i wouldnt reprioritize to fit this in. over praised and under developed, this book is one that is better left on the shelf."
3,Not exactly what I expected,"Don't read my rating wrong, I think this book was well written, but it wasn't what I though it would be. This books is a series of short stories that each take a different perspective on time.During one of my (sometimes too brief) peaks of interest I became interested in Physics. I learned all the basics about how time is not the same at all places because it is effected by speed. For instance a few interesting examples are air planes that have to compensate their computers for the slight changes in time because they are traveling with or against the rotation of the Earth.There are a lot of strange stories about time moving very differently from Earth, but some didn't really make sense to me. Not because they were different than the way I think about time, but because they literally didn't make and sense.There are some diamonds in the rough, but read the real science instead of these stories. It's much more compelling."
2,Disappointed,...The dreams are based on different views of how time might vary from one place to another and the implications of such variations. Some are within the bounds of my imagination but many seem to me to be quite far fetched and unhelpful in understanding the effects of such variations and it seems unlikely that Einstein's brain would have entertained such views even when he was asleep.
1,Concepts too simple and not developed,"The concepts of time and reality in this book are much too simple and Lightman failed to develop any of the multiple scenarios to any interesting level. So much potential existed within the alternate realities, but by only spending 3 pages on each, I could not get interested. Once I understood what a particular chapter's concept was, I knew that once I turned the page it would be over and Lightman would be onto something new. This was distracting to say the least. SO many interesting things could have occured within each chapter, and he failed to explore any of the possibilities."
2,Lightman's dreams not necessarily Einstein's,Imaginative but also silly and annoying at times.The title is designed to cash in on the famous Einstein name.The best parts were when Einstein was ''directly'' alluded to.
4,Light reflections on Time.....,"Einstein, whose phenomenal brain has been grappling with the metaphysics of time, dozes and dreams himself into scenarios in which time takes on unexpected qualities. Time, of course, governs memory and all sorts of other human faculties. The dreams include related concepts like cause and effect, destiny, etc. It might sound super-technical, but Lightman's real concern is how people relate to and are influenced by their notions of time. His foray into what Einstein might have dreamed is enchanting and very human.If you've ever marvelled at how time seems to go at different speeds depending on how much fun you're having, you'll love this book. Time goes backwards, turns somersaults, goes in concentric circles...and people follow it. Lightman's prose is perfect for these fleeting dreamlike visions. Some pieces are much better than others, so the texture is a little inconsistent, but it's a lovely book to have on hand. Keep it by your bed!"
4,"Know what you are, before you sell yourself","A soft beauty & lightness of touch. Works; is good, but done before. Does for time what Calvino does for cities. But lyrics often fail as novels. Only momentum is pages in the hand. Know what you are, before you sell yourself."
5,"Wonderful, poetic novel...","It's called a novel, but it reads like an epic prose poem.What a great journey of the imagination.Some reviewers gave this one star? They should know Einstein himself once warned of a mind with too much knowledge in it and not enough imagination.I read this and loved it when it first came out, and decided recently to assign it to my senior level poetry class (B period). They loved it."
1,Wish I could go back in time and not read it.,"Lots of praise and an interesting concept led me to finally read this book, only to be disappointed. The mini-stories are undeveloped, and don't really engage you. Lots of repetition also, hard to believe he teaches writing at MIT."
2,scattered apart novel,"I can't believe it can be publish as a novel,save you money for other good book"
1,Claptrap! Psychobabble.,"Sadly, we learn nothing of Einstein's dreams from the point of view of a physicist trained and teacher of writing (the author), and if one is to be informed by this book, read only the Prologue for information about the young Einstein's work day at the patent office. Otherwise, this book has lots of Freudian physique - sex and slithering - but neither physics nor metaphysics. This book drools, and is a sad testament to uninspired writing and starry-eyed sentiment. Pity the author can't take it back."
2,Boring,Good writing but it doesn't seem to go anywhere. Its one of those kind of books that people think most be real deep because they can't figure out what it is trying to say. What it says to me is... BORING.
2,Bland and shallow,"Disappointing and far from groundbreaking. A few of the stories repeat very similar ideas, which was filler in an already (thankfully) short book. It seemed to me as though the author had a few thoughts about the concept of time, thought that they were terribly deep and original, and laid down a few chapters of limp pseudo intellectual prose.It also seemed tacky to assume the identity of Einstein and delve into his supposedly wildest dreams. I would have preferred an oblique reference or homage-- it would have been more meaningful.If you have never wondered what it would be like if time moved backwards, then this is the book for you. Otherwise, skip it and read something that delves deeper."
5,Captivating,"This ""novel"" as they put it is absolutley captivating.It really gets your brain twisted in knots with ideas and possibilities!"
4,Good stuff!,"A grim story of myth and black magic in the slums of Scotland. Cool story, awesome cinematography, and intriguing concepts in a bleak world of modern fantasy. The monster was a bit underwhelming though."
1,Slow motion horror flick...needs subtitles.,"This was yet another ""slow"" moving horror flick from the ""Bloody Disgusting Selects"" series. I almost turned it off, but the ending held my interest. Nothing new here...no creativity...just another mainstream flick that would probably feed the pallets of novice horror film fans. I dozed off during the first 30 minutes. Tried to stay awake. A very boring film (like I said) until the ending. Furthermore, the Australian lingo (I believe it was Australian) was difficult to understand. They speak like most people write on Facebook...totally out of synch with reality. I had to turn on the subtitles to translate what they were saying...very annoying. Good luck! It only gets a ""1"" with me."
2,Predictable with bad special effects,"This movie sounded really good in the description. It's a film from Ireland so I thought they would know about all things mystical and creepy. The story is creepy and different. It just wasn't very well done. The actors were pretty good and the dialog was well written. The plot and ending were predictable and lame. Sorry, I really wanted to like this movie."
3,"Could of Been Great, But Slow Pacing Bogged Down This Intelligent Film in the Mud","3 1/2 Stars = Very GoodThis slow paced, but intelligent horror film is more of a character study of it's principals, than a full fledged horror film. That is not to say it's not a horror film, & a pretty damn good one in both plot, script, direction, & acting. It just suffers from a slow pace, which usually does not bother me, but maybe it was my mood? Even so, this film leaves you wondering what is going on during it's running time (a good thing), & for people who love occult films, this will most likely light your candle.""Outcast"" 2010"
3,Not a bad movie. Certainly worth a rental,"I found myself somewhat entertained by this movie. It has it's moments of suspense though I found little in the way of real horror.The movie is well shot and well acted. I would NOT spend the money for a purchase. One would probably be satisfied in viewing it once via rental. All in all I enjoyed it and it was well worth the price of a rental. It was quite apparent that true professional filmakers were involved in making this movie and there was certainly no shortage of good actors.Rent it, please don't waste the money purchasing the movie though, you will regret it."
2,Not very good,"It's not the worst horror flick I've ever seen, but it's not very good. And the part where the teen boy turns into a monster after sex might resonate with a few members of the female audience, but it's awful silly."
1,Forgetable,I didn't make it past the beginning. It's so bad I don't even remember why I turned it off that quick.
1,aweful,"Slow, boring, sound was quiet, playback was good. The movie sucked in my opinion. Not Amazon's fault just the movie itself"
4,The best I have tried so far. . .,"I have crazy thick, curly hair and have tried many products in order to tame it. This product is by the far the best. Instead of having to use multiple products to keep my hair under control, I can use Redken 07 by itself. It leaves my hair feeling weightless instead of glued to my head. Unfortunately, there is a little bit of a crunch but less than the other products I have been using. This is also the product that my hair salon uses when I go in. I would recommend this product for anyone with curly hair who wants to tame it in one easy step (and who doesn't want that)."
1,Depends on your hair texture,"I see that a few people like this product, but I tried it as a free sample. And, I didn't see any improvement or control of my VERY thick curly hair. I am mixed ethnic background. I have a lot of hair, and it is ringlet curly. I was looking for something that defines the rings more..but, this didn't do anything. My quest continues..."
5,Enhance your wave pattern,"After having a relaxer for years, my hair is now natural, no chemicals. Washed and used this product after being recommended by someone else. It enhanced my wave pattern and use a little, twist around your finger and voila, ringlets!"
3,"Good DVD, But....","I have other instructional DVDs by Greg Koch and as noted by others, yes, he is a very talented player and yes, he can be very annoying. Although the songs are well explained, this would be a much better DVD if they had a backing track to play along with and more importantly, if they supplied tablature for the parts they teach. I understand the need to cut costs, so rather than supplying Tab on paper in each DVD case, how about putting it on the DVD in a separate section, or having it online at their website where after inputting your DVD code, you could download it."
3,greg koch is a great player but...,"I purchased this dvd because I thought that the entire song was covered and instead it is just the signature licks of the songs and koch playing along with his band. Koch is an excellent guitar player as evidenced here and on his other dvd I have guitar gristle but his demeanor, jokes may be funny at first but after a while it tends to wear on your nerves and the time he spends talking about nothing and joking could be spent teaching material. That said he does cover some good stuff but if I saw it before I bought it I would not have purchased it."
1,very basic trot through Himes' life,"I bought this on spec hoping it might be interesting. It isn't. It's about 40 minutes long, and is a couple of talking heads running through an outline of Chester Himes' life. The odd photo is shown but no interviews with Himes himself - or with anyone who knew him - or with incisive scholars or analysts. It feels like some ultra-cheap educational leftover, and I can't imagine anyone who knew enough about Himes to find it on Amazon learning anything useful or interesting from it. Oh well."
5,Thank You Jonetta,"I would like to say what a joy and a healing it has been for me reading ""Whatever Happened to Daddy's Little Girl"" (The Impact of Fatherlessness on Black Women) by Jonetta Rose Barras. I have read it but constantly go back to it since I finished it. This book has literally captured my insecurities, made me admit to them, look deep into myself about where they came from, and encouraged me to know that can come from it all and be a complete woman. I would encourage anyone to read it, even if you grew up with your father, because we need to know how to edify our sisters and provide that understanding for that siter that may not have had it as well as you have. I'm already thinking about starting a group in my church for women my age, who may be going through these situations and suffering silently because they feel no one understands. Anyway, I could go on and on, but I think i have said enough. GOD BLESS"
4,Necessary dialogue that has been ignored for too long,"Jonetta Rose Barras identifies the fatherless syndrome of feeling unloved, unlovable and unable to love in a healthy man and woman relationship. The effects of growing up without a father are pointed out page after page. The healing process is somewhat less visible, but the author makes it clear that identifying the syndrome is half the battle."
5,Healing is needed,"I am so pleased to write this review. I read this book several years ago, but continued to deny that this girl couldn't possibly be me. Well it is a cold day when you look in the mirror and see your reflection clearly. I am so thankful for the honest account provided by Jonetta Barras. Ladies please realize you have to heal to move on. When you continue to cover hurt and pain the situation only gets worse. Choose healing, forgiveness, and love. Soon you will realize that uncovering the layers of pain truly does reveal the real you. As black women we have so many burdens to bear, and father loss and absence is real and it impacts us in many ways. Let's finally stand up united take the hand of another sister so that we may all heal together.Be Blessed........"
5,This is where its at,"Is it just me or does Matador kinda remind you of that big amorphous blob that merges with everything at the end of Akira. What's with them snatching up all of my favorite bands. They have enough talent, leave everyone else alone. Lookout did a much better job with this disc then Matador did with the follow up. I've had this CD for almost a year and I'm just getting around to the review now. This album is like a 26 minute adreniline rush with 1 minute break to cool down in the middle. I love the way ideas fly at you from every direction and by the time you latch on to something, theyve already thrown it out and are on to the next thing. Theres more hooks in this half hour of music than the rest of my music collection combined. I can't even begin to tell you how blown away I still am from this album."
4,Finally I'm not alone!,"Yeah, I hate my ""friends"" too. This is punk for ""people with nothing in their eyes"" or destructively nihilistic tendencies. It honestly sounds like Exene Cervenka fronting At the Drive-In. Or something. Anyway, ""Speakers Push the Air"" is up there with my favorite songs this year. ""Sad Girls Por Vida,"" ""The Get Away,"" ""Ghosts in the Radio,"" and, my personal second-place favorite, ""By the Throat"" all carry similar potential. The album as a whole could have been more powerful, farther out, the lyrics need just a little work, and it's only 27 minutes! That's not enough, even for a punk debut. Especially when the music is this good. Top 20 of 2002.Any band with a name from Jack Kerouac's ""The Dharma Bums"" has to be worth it."
4,i sorta see the big deal,"it really deserves 3 1/2 stars, but i rounded up. these guys don't really have much going on. in many ways they kind of remind me of and you will know us by the trail of dead, which isn't so bad. it might take many more listenings, but i could see myself being confident in a solid 4 star rating some day."
3,"Not that original...buy ""at the drive-in"" instead","I don't mind this cd, but i have to give it a 3 because i hate listening to bands that sound like other bands. True there is a female vocalist, but the music is just too at the drive-in. I cannot enjoy it...unless i saw ced, jim, omar, and company rocking out to these beats. It's cool i guess, but don't be deceived...save ur money and buy ATDI. If u want something sweet and original buy the mars volta or minus the bear."
3,three and a half star album,"If the scale would allow me to I would give this album three and a half stars, but it doesn't so I just wrote it in the title of the review. I hope no one minds. Anyway enough sillyness. This CD is pretty solid, there is nothing ground breaking here but pretty much every song is good. Pretty Girls Make Graves(what a horrible name) sounds like your basic girl fronted pop punk band with At the Drive In and Faraquet style riffs mixed in. The lead singer kind of sounds like the lead singer of Discount. Definitely recommended, but don't expect to be blown away."
2,At the Drive In with a girl singer......you decide,"I have to admit, the songs on here are pretty catchy, but they sound like At the Drive In so much that it bothers me. The way she sings her vocals, & the guy sing-shouting backup....jeez.ATDI broke up because Cedric & Omar were sick of playing the type of music that they were playing (screamo? melodic post-punk?) so it seems kind of lame to me, being a huge ATDI fan, that another band would try to capitalize on that sound when the band that made that sound famous are way over that musical style themselves. I couldn't even listen to the whole album. But hey, if you've never heard ATDI, you'd probably think this stuff was mindblowing."
1,.,"yay,this is one great album,not. i bought this cause they were comin to town with the alkie trio and i wanted to check em out cause shows are always more fun when you know what you're listenin to,you know?.anyways, this cd has god awful lyrics,(""the girl with the ice cream cone"")and it doesn't have the length or amount of tracks to feel like you gave yourself a really worthy purchase.not only do i not like this album though,i hate this band in general.when they played at the show they played TWO songs from this album. their entire 45 minute set was made up of new songs from their then-unreleased new romance cd.isn't it great when not even your fans know what they're listening to? at least they played the best two songs though, more sweet soul and speakers push the air.this album made me feel utterly unsatisfied with my purchase and i wouldn't reccomend buying it.they also named their band after a smiths song too. i really can't stand that."
1,dog sweater,I measured my dog as instructed and it was still way too small and I was not able to use it...almost broke my dogs leg trying to get the sweater on him
1,very thin material,This looks like it is a cable knit. It's not. It is very thin and doesn't keep my doggie warm. It does look cute on her though.
2,Wrong Sizing,"This sweater did not fit our 40 pound border collie mix, it was much too tight. The product itself is great, but they need to do more work on the proper sizing charts. Just be aware of this when ordering-consider ordering one size larger."
1,Wouldn't purchase again,"As soon as I put this sweater on my dog, he started walking like there was something wrong (my dog is used to the kind of sweater that doesn't wrap around his back legs). It seemed to fit well and didn't seem to pull anywhere but even after a day, he wasn't used to it. By the third day he wore it, the neck had stretched out to the point that it sat below his shoulders, like a scoop neck. I don't know if everyone would have the same problem, but this did not fit my dog correctly and made him very uncomfortable. I took it off and reverted back to the style he's more used to. Unfortunately, he will probably never wear this one again."
1,THIN USELESS SWEATER,Not only is this sweater too thin to keep my dog warm but the straps that wrap under her hind legs to keep the sweater on never stay on.
2,Not for Mini Dachshunds,The sweater is nice and warm for my miniature dachshund but his legs are too short so the sweater falls off very easily.
1,poor quality,This luggage ripped after only a few trips with the bag. After a few more uses the pull out handlebecame stuck and is not usable. Like Luggage promised to take care of it but after many calls and emails there was no response. My daughter loved the bag but felt ripped off after it fell apart so quickly.
3,Tales of a Good Guy,"Jaye E. Seay's book, THE LIFE AND LOVES OF A NOT SO AVERAGE JOE, tells the story of Hill Taylor, a young man who is coming of age and discovering himself. Hill is a college educated young man who is trying to make a difference by teaching. He does not fit the usual stereotypes that one often sees in the media, depicting Black men in a negative light. Instead, despite what the title suggests, Hill is an average guy. The book follows Hill as he experiences true love and heartache while all the time trying to define himself and what he wants to achieve in life.Seay has written a novel that shows men in a positive light and debunks the old myth that ""nice guys finish last."" He gives a realistic portrayal of the life of a positive, young Black man.Reviewed by Latoya Carter-Qawiyyof The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers"
5,Honest,Get this book! A honest book about what life/love is like through the eyes of the new generation. Way to go Jay =).Jeryl C.
4,Great Book,I needed it for a college course. It definitely provokes a lot of thought. Very interesting stories. These people are amazing.
2,Nice But Durable?,"The table is extremely light weight and portable. With a little practice it sets up quickly and nothing else compares in weight and compact size.My only issues are design durability. I have owned the table a couple of years and used it about 10 times on desert camping trips to hold camp stoves and other gear. The plastic clips that hold the parts together are now breaking with no replacement parts available from Eastman Outdoors. Because of this, I would not recommend the product."
1,Do not buy,"The item I received must have been another unsatisfied customer's return. I purchased new and received a dirty, dented and broken table. The plastic hinges were cracked on three legs. The box claims to permit assembly in 10 seconds and I estimate 4-5 minutes to be more accurate. Fortunately my item's condition did not allow me to test this theory. I highly recommend you pass on this table immediately.The smaller version of this table is nicer. I've been using it for a week and it seems adequately sturdy for the light use that I need it for."
4,Great toddler snack,"My 3yo daughter loves the cherry flavored ones at our local grocery. Obviously the price point was better here, except no cherry flavor. She still will eat them, but not as well as the cherry. They are super easy to grab and go for snacks while we are out."
5,YUMMY!!,Bought these for my 15 month old and I will NEVER go back to the Gerber cereal bars.These have more nutritional value and cost less.The only down side is it's hard to get him to eat just one. It finishes so quickly he begs for more. I wish they made a slightly bigger size for bigger kidsGreat product!
2,not organic but tasty,"It should not be advertised as organic, since it doesn't have the USDA organic seal and only the flour and the cane sugar is organic. Still it is tasty and partially organic snack."
4,"Great taste, a bit mushy and messy though","As a mom I love these but more importantly my 3 year old LOVES these! They taste yummy (yes I've had them), are a good size for my daughter to hold and aren't loaded with sugar in my opinion. The only downside is that they're sorta soft and mushy and fall apart easily. If you throw them in your bag for on the go be prepared for mushy, messy snacks. Overall I like them but they're not as solid as the adult variety."
4,Even mom and dad find it yummy,"I like the way each bar is packed individually. Hubby gave 2 bars to my 2.5 year old son today, served in a wide and shallow plastic bowl just in case the crumbs fell everywhere. The snack bar fits in his tiny hand perfectly. It's not too thick, so biting it is almost effortless. He absolutely loves it. He was too busy to answer my question ""is it good?"" by showing me thumbs up while his mouth was busy chewing, LOL. Hubby and I love its taste as well. It's slightly sweet and sour, pretty appetizing. Surprisingly, my son left very little crumbs in his bowl at the end of his snack time. The reason I rate it 4-star because I was hoping it's crunchy outside and soft inside. Well, it's probably messier if it's crunchy. I will definitely recommend this product to my friends."
1,Organic does not equal healthy,"We received two of the Earth's Best Bars in a holiday gift bag for our toddler. In an 18 gram bar, there were about 6 grams of sugar--a full third of the bar is sugar. No wonder there are rave reviews about how much the toddlers are enjoying them!"
2,These are not organic,"While Earth's Best produces great organic products for kids, these use some but not all organic ingredients. All Earth's Best products that are organic will have that word below their logo, this does not. We were disappointed to see these marketed as organic on this website but then noticed the legal disclaimer that Amazon will not be held responsible if the information on the site does not accurately describe the product. If you are looking for good, healthy cereal bars for kids, these are an excellent choice. But if you want a 100% organic cereal bar, keep shopping."
2,Bleh,"I keep reading the Lucy Stone mysteries, hoping they'll get better. Unfortunately, they seem to have hit a new low. Anthrax? A secret chemical lab on an abandoned island? Evil scientists? I felt like I was watching an episode of ""Scooby Doo"" instead of reading a quality mystery novel.I think Lucy needs to take a rest from her sleuthing."
3,Yawn in the Big Apple,"This was a snooze. It took forever for the murder to take place on Lucy and Elizabeth's trip to the Big Apple. This was probably so that the characters and plot could be developed.I was skimming in the last few chapters but who actually won the makeover contest and the $10,000? Amazing how things turn out so well in the end.I missed the Tinker's Cove setting, but I am sure the author is thinking that Tinker's Cove must have the highest murder rate in the nation.The story line was far fetched but I guess anything is possible in New York. I know this author can do better and already has. I will buy the next installment and I don't regret reading this one."
2,Disappointing,"I had purchased and read Mistletoe Murder, which I enjoyed a lot. This book was not a good follow-up. It just dragged. I am an avid reader, and it seemed to take me ""forever"" to get through this one. The storyline and the details just did not seen believable. I am not sure if I will take a chance on reading any of the others she has written. I was very disappointed."
1,Ever hear of a period?,"This could have been a great book had the author not insisted in writing in an overly dense style that did more to hide her main points than illuminate them. If you like reading convoluted ten clause sentences then you'll love this book. Again, the issue here isn't so much the theory or arguments contained within the book, the problem is with how this information is presented."
5,A Horn Player's Dream,"The French Horn is counted by many to be the king of classical instruments and with recordings such as this who would balme people for thinking so. This recording is a true credit to the soloist and orchestra who invested time into making this. It has captured the true excitment and passion of the Franz and Richard Strauss Horn Concerto's and has then improved on them. It widely renowned amongst the classical world of the difficulty of the Strauss Horn Concerto's , yet Ifor James has shown true virtuosity to the point of fooling the listener into thinking that these pieces are quite simple. Antoni Wit and the Katowice Polish Radio/TV Symphony Orchestra are also stunning, bringing the music to life and giving it true Strauss character. This recording would have to be a must for any Horn Player across the world and for any respector of fine classical music. A solid listening investment."
5,extreamly seductive and raunchy,"If you want real sexual situations just as they happen and with the lovers thoughts just as you would like your love life to be than read everything Eve Locke composes, you'll love it just like I do it's my bible"
5,I'm a Lesbian and this is just for me,"I don't know if Eve Locke is a lesbian or not but she does have the knack of opening my heart, her way of describing our way of life is as close as anyone could describe, and her sexual scenes are so real and intimidating I get excited with every turn of the page. Hooray for Eve Locke she's an angel and I hope she's a lesbian"
1,Just plain bad.,"I couldn't even get more than a few chapters in. This has to be one of the worst books of any genre I've read - but definitely the worst lesbian erotica ever. I bought it based on the high reviews, but going back through them, it's apparent they are written by the same few people."
4,Looks like fun,Our dog goes to this toy when the other toys are not available. I am not sure why she doesn't love it.
5,geat toy,My terrier loves this toy! We use it as an outdoor toy only. Very high pitched squeak which the dog loves!It is durable - no rips or holes at all! I did not buy on amazon but after 6 months I would highly recommend. I have seen reviews about feet being chewed off. Always supervise dogs like they are a toddler. My dog like the feet to carry the ball.
5,The best dog toys,The company that makes these dog toys is the best. The shapes encourage the dogs to play. In this case this ball has feet that the dogs use to carry it when they chase each other. The ears also keep my younger dog busy for hours as he tries to chew them off. The material is soft enough that the dogs can make the squeak but durable enough that I've never had one destroyed. I wish you could choose the colors at purchase.
5,My Black Labs Favorite Toy!!!,"My dog absolutely loves these toys! We have bought so many toys for him in the past 10 years and he chews up every one of them. I do admit he does not like the feet on these, but I beleive you can find them in more of a ball shape without the feet. He chews the horns off too. He is careful about it, and spits out the pieces in a neat pile on the floor, so i dont worry about him choking. But once they are removed, he absolutely loves to carry these things around the house and play. Also great throwing them in the leaves in the fall, and in the snow in the winter!"
2,BE CAREFUL!,"I personally know 5 people who had to have surgery on their dogs because of this toy. Yes, it's fun(and the medium size fits it a large chuck-it) but those FEET. I've known dogs who chewed and swallowed the feet in a matter of seconds.. some passed them within 48 hours but five unlucky ones got obstructions and had to have surgery(one cost over $2,500. Some people are smart and simply cut the feet off while I simply buy the ""Other cuz"" which has posts instead of feet which I highly recommend."
4,Great toy but squeaker breaks,"My dog loves this toy and the squeak it makes. He runs around with it and chews it as well as chases it and plays fetch. The one problem I have with this toy is that I'm about to by my third one because the squeaker breaks. I now have two Cuz toys (all smooth round, one yellow and one green) with broken squeakers and one Dino Cuz that seems to be more durable. Yes, the rubber stays in tact but the squeaker helps me leash train my puppy and get his attention so I really rely on it."
3,My Westie loves the Cuz but beware...,"My three and a half yr. old Westie loves the Cuz but they should be checked from time to time. My dog is not a chewer-he loves to chase the Cuz when I throw it. I noticed a few months ago the feet were missing and I found one but never found the other one but did not think too much about it. About 1 month ago Riley got sick and ended up at the vets for emergency surgery for a bowel obstruction caused by the Cuz foot. I stronly recommend that if you have/get one, periodically check the feet and make sure the rubber has not cracked or that the feet are not loose. He has another one and I have cut the feet off of it."
4,Holy crap - these things are huge!,"My dogs always love the good/bad cuz squeaker toys, they go nuts for the high-pitch squeal. I found them here on Amazon and couldn't believe how much cheaper they are, so I ordered 3 of the Large size. I'm familiar with this product, so I didn't bother reading the description, so just an FYI the ""large"" size is really and EXTRA large size- they're freaking huge!! Also, the squeaker in this size is not the normal eardrum busting, want to stab myself in the face, high-pitch squeal.. it's much lower, and requires more pressure to squeeze, so that's actually kind of nice. Not sure if the dogs will feel the same way, though.I have large dogs - a boxer, cattle dog, and newly fostering an American Bulldog mix.. so I'm sure they will still love them just as much, if not more. Just a buyer beware in case you don't want a bad cuz the size of mars for your dog."
2,Too small,"This toy is hardly larger than a golf ball, if that. I would not recommend it for anything but a very small dog. I ordered one for my Scottie, but I am returning it to get a larger one. I also ordered a medium Bad Other Cuz which is a perfect size for him and he loves it."
5,Bad Cuz,"I have a pit who chews up everything. He broke the squeaker quickly but is still playing with the ball and not chewing it up!!! Although the feet were the first thing to go. Amazing! I ordered 3 more, one for my friends pit."
5,Great for big chewer,My large dog lives with this by his side. He did break the squeaky part pretty quick. After a year of use I am looking to buy him a fresh one.The feet make it easy to get from him. The feet also add some 'action' to the bounce when thrown.He has liked the large KONGS in the past but this toy holds up just as well and is cute.Stan Horstman
1,DO NOT BUY!!!!,"These toys are super cute and they squeak for awhile BUT the feet fall off and are VERY DANGEROUS!!!!! I worried my dog would swallow them but luckily he didn't. Please keep in mind that the squeaker will break, little pieces will come off and the feet will come off. Total CHOKING HAZARD!!!! Buyer beware!!!!!!!! I only wish I could give this 0 stars. My dog, a 3 year old Pembroke Welsh Corgi, loves this little ball with the horns but it is very dangerous because of the choking hazards (the feet and the broken squeaker)!!!!"
4,favorite toy,My dog loves this toy. I have to de-squeak it as soon as we get one but other than that it lasts a long time and the dog loves it.
3,Not as tough as advertized,"I try to find tough AND fun toys for my lovable destructor of all things plush and squeaky, but most of the time, the tough ones aren't FUN. I bought this off of a recommendation that it was for dogs that loved to chew and was tough enough to last. She LOVED the squeak - it is loud and obnoxious - perfect. But within five minutes she had the feet and horns chewed off. Luckily, my dog does NOT swallow pieces that she tears off, she just spits and keeps destroying. But if you have a dog that swallows bits and pieces, WATCH THEM CAREFULLY.For me, this wasn't worth the money, even though she loved it - it only lasted about 15 minutes before the squeaker was chewed out. So, even the ones without the feet don't hold up, unfortunately. Sigh... the search continues!"
4,"Smaller than expected, but dog still loves it","The small toy is a lot smaller than expected, in fact its basically tiny. I had to laugh when I got it since it was so tiny, but none the less my dog loves it. I have a Westie and the moment I gave it to her she played with it for an hour straight. I think next time I'll order the medium size toy for her. The toy is well made, hard rubber but soft enough for my dog to make it squeek. It bounces around, so she can throw it in the air and it'll bounce away from her. I do recommend this toy for your dog. It's durable and obviously dogs love it."
5,My dog's favorite,"My Golden Retriever loves balls, and this is his favorite. He loves the squeak when he bites it (although the squeak usually disappears after a month), and seems to enjoy being able to grab it directly, or by the feet. It's particularly useful when you have to throw a ball in a crowded or hilly area, because the legs and ball's softness prevent it from going far. But if you're in a flat area and want long throws, this is the wrong ball."
3,Bad Cuz not for my dog,"Bad Cuz became ""Ball"" Cuz within a matter of minutes. My dog immediately chewed off the horns and feet in one go, so now we jut have a big squeaky ball. I don't recommend this for an agressive chewer."
1,I ordered two balls but really only got one - what gives Amazon?,My dog loves these Cuz toys. The only reason I rated this as a one is because I ordered two Bad Cuz Toys and got only ONE bad cuz ball in the mail. They did send me another toy but it was something entirely different. It had a huge hole in it - so basically I got ripped off for one ball.
3,"OK, but not good for 'real' chewers","My labs chewed the squeaker out in 36 hours. The feet went even faster, but the body seems pretty durable and the squeaker can be reinstalled pretty easy."
3,Was great while it had feet...,"This ball was great for about a week. The problem is, the little feet are just too easy for a normal size dog to chew off. Luckily he didn't swallow them, but I could easily see that happen with other dogs.I will say, he absolutely loved this ball even after the feet were gone. He also hasn't been able to rip it apart any further, or put any holes in it. Bottom line, it's a nice toy, but you have to be careful - you must keep an eye on your dog with this toy, especially if he/she is a chewer."
3,Average Squeaky Ball,"Our dog had one of the medium Cuz dog toys, and we lost it in the woods before she had a chance to kill the squeaker. I bought the second toy because it was $3. She had it for a week and has already killed the squeaker with puncture holes. I knew the ball was not very durable, but for $3 our dog had fun with it. I automatically snipped the legs and horns off of the toy or else our dog would have eaten them whole.On a another note, I purchased the x-large Cuz toy and it's still alive without puncture holes. She cannot fit her jaws around the larger toy so it has actually lasted longer than one month (this is a record for a squeaky toy for her). The larger ball is fun to throw around, but can also break fragile objects. The JW toys just can't stand up to our dog's persistent chewing (accept the x-large toy)."
1,lasted about 5 mins,My 70lb mixed breed dog tore off the feet and ears in the first few minutes she had the toy. Afraid she might swallow the pieces...I grew up with a Vet in our household and I learned early on that toys that fall apart may lead to emergency GI surgery. So I quickly remove toys that are pulled apart
1,Looks good but squeaker broke instantly,"I've purchased other JW Pet toys and they have lasted at least a week. This one lasted less than an hour before the squeaker fell out of the toy. If you want a long lasting squeaker, then look elsewhere."
3,better than other dog toys but still disappointed,"I have a 14 month Saint Bernard. She got her first Bad Cuz when she was 8 and it took her 3-4 months to destroy it. I decided to buy her a new one. Unfortunatelly, now it took her only 3 days to destroy it. The most vulnerable parts are the valve (she pushed it in)and the legs. Nevertheless, a Bad Cuz is still more resistant than any other dog toy we bought."
3,Do NOT like change in Design,"I started ordering these for my dogs because Amazon had them cheaper and I could buy several at a time. I had a hard time finding these locally. The toy itself is pretty durable. What I don't like is a recent change in the toy's design. It is supposed to be a squeaker ball, but they have added a hole above the squeaker so that the squeaker really doesn't ""squeak"" unless you cover that hole. One of my dogs will only play with a squeaker ball, so once he has worn out the squeaker, it's time for a new one. The new design makes it almost pointless (for me) to buy this model any longer. Why put a squeaker into a dog toy only to offset the squeaker with another hole that cancels the ""squeak""?"
4,Sooo small!,"I got two small ones for my Shih Tzu and Pom and I giggled when I opened the box--they are SO tiny! The small size is about 2"" in dia., 6"" in cir., and 2.5"" tall. Other people said their dogs ate the feet off of them, which makes me a little nervous (my pom -10 mo- has been chewing through everything), so I think I'm going to keep them for fetch time only. Other than that they are really adorable, are made of really thick rubber, and are super bouncy! I just might have to try the medium size, too."
3,SQUEAKS..,"Cute as can be but if I knew it squeeked, I wouldn't have bought it. Could have been I didn't look close enough but thought I'd let you know."
1,jw bad cuz dog toy squeaker did not work,When the JW pet company bad cuz dog toy arrived the squeaker did not work. Why would they ship an item that doesn't work? Too much trouble to return so I kept it but my dog was not interested at all. That kind of quality control is poor. I won't order from them again.
4,The feeeet,"My 80 pound pit bull mix puppy LOVED this toy. It was amazing because even after a ton of playing he did not manage to tear it to shreds every other toy I tried. He did chew off the feet right away though so those really are useless, they make a mess, and even though they are cute they only last a few mites before being torn off. I ended up buying two of them total because he loved them so much and kept losing them under the couch (two game me time to look for them while he was entertained), but the rubber everywhere was seriously a pain."
3,Not as I hoped.,"I received this item, unpacked it, gave it to my 7 month old puppy and within 20-30 minutes he had chewed the feet off. He also swallowed some of the bits he chewed off. It is now a ball. The toy was not as durable as I had hoped."
3,Meh,"This dog toy is awesome, it is made of durable non-toxic rubber, and when gets in contact with my dog slobber becomes very slippery. Only problem is that the squeaker is a separate plastic piece. I was able to dislodge it with-in minutes, but luckily it fell into the toy so I could not choke on it. Also, I am dog so woof bark lick scoot fart."
4,My dog is obsessed....,"After my dog stole this ball off another pooch at the dog park, I had to get one--plus the surface is smooth, so it doesn't absorb as much slobber...among other things. The squeaker broke within days of receiving it, but honestly, it was driving me crazy anyway. This is my dog's favorite toy--hands down."
2,Super cute - BUT sooo rough!,Hello - I think this set is soooo cute and my son really likes it however I have 2 major issues:1 - The elastic on the fitted sheet are so small and weak - they don't fit well around the mattress (we have a sealy perfect night mattress) and thus it comes off the mattress very easily!2 - The material is so rough - i even washed it with downy and still - the material is very rough - my son sometimes wakes up with red marks on his cheeks - he does have sensitive skin.Not sure the desriptions of kids sheets show thread counts - but next time I'll want to try before I buy!Caroline
2,"Scratchy/rough sheet set, even toddler complains about roughness","I've made the mistake of buying ""100% soft cotton percale"" (210 thread count says OK site) sheets, including two sets from Olive Kids. My son loved the patterns, but despite my washing them with fabric softener and dryer softener sheets, he still complains ""these sheets are scrtachy and hurt me"". Maybe its the printing. They've been washed about 5 times now and I've taken to using a white jersey pillowcase to protect his face. I hope OK upgrades their thread count, but from now on, I'm NEVER buying percale. My son is three and doesn't normally complain about fabric."
3,Very Cute But Not Well Made,"These sheets are adorable. We have decorated our son's room in this theme with the matching border, 5 large wall decals, sheets and decorative pillow. I LOVE his room as much as he does! However, these sheets were not well made. The top sheet's print is upside down. The blue trim at the top is so wrinkled that over time the blue is faded in the permanent wrinkles. Also, the pillowcase wasn't sewn straight so it doesn't lay nicely. The print has held up well though, after a year it hasn't faded."
4,Travel and Adventure Journal,A wonderful journal for children with photo and text collages of adventure heros past and present. Something for everyone.
2,Nice idea for a tape but not well made,"I think the idea of a story pole tape is great but this product is not very durable. It slipped off my belt and fell less than 2 feet landing on a wood stair breaking the rewind mechanism, which released the entire length of the tape. I've had the tape less than a month and have only used it a few times. My 15 year old Stanley Powerlock has dropped from greater heights and is still working. I'm not likely to purchase another FastCap product."
3,Not my go to tape,I like the design and love the ability to use a story pole but having never used one before its going to take some getting use to. The biggest drawback is not having the measurement lines on both sides of the tape. Maybe I should have just got the story pole with no measurements to eliminate the frustration. You will use a regular tape much more and this on occassion. It is well made for around the shop/garage.
3,Fantastic,"This is the best workout video I have ever owned. It is easy learn and do, and I get a very intense but relaxing workout. I have recommeded it to everyone I know. Everyone from my kids to me dad love it and have lots of fun doing it. My legs are stronger, my balance is better and I hve lost hard to lose weight. I recommend it to anyone serious about getting fit with something brand new on the market. There is nothing else like it anywhere!"
5,An absolute must for any one interested in jukeboxes!,"What a great resource! This book is fulled with pictures, history and information; all designed to give the novice and the expert a true and futher appreciation of jukeboxes. Mike Baute has done an exceptional job of combining technical and informative context in one comprehensive guide. However, Amazon buyers beware!!! The price guide was not included in my shipment...however I called Mike, and he graciously sent me a price guide, a free copy of his newsletter and a nice note. His generosity and prompt attention to my request has made me even more enthusiastic about this book and the world of jukeboxes. If you have the opportunity, subscribe to the Always Jukin' newsletter...trust me, you won't be sorry! Buy this book, subscribe to Mike's newsletter and support a great resource. Once you buy the book...watch out! You will become a collector in no time!!!"
1,i live in portadown,"and believe me i knew sands and walter mitty doesnt even begin to describe him. a book based on his word can only be described as a disney story. when it became known that he was the source for the book it was the laughing stock of mid ulster. had the committee really existed a lot more people would have died , simple as that."
5,"Convincing Account of N.Ireland's ""Police"" Death Squads","At considerable risk to himself and his family, the author pursues the truth behind Police-sanctioned murder in Northern Ireland. The book arose out of a Channel 4 TV documentary produced by the author which detailed allegations of collusion by the RUC (N. Irelands ""Police"" force) and Protestant death squads. The allegations are well supported and corroborated. The British response at the time was to set up an ""inquiry"" in which the RUC was directed to investigate itself!I couldn't put this book down. A must for anyone who thinks the IRA are the problem."
5,THE COMMITTEE,My review is soely on the quality of service from XYZ books. i ordered this book through them as it is banned in ireland. the book was ordered on August 20th and i was very much surprised to receive it yesterday 30th August. i would totally recommend them for the service they have provided.
5,Many questions raised. Answers few.,"Having read the book with an open mind, I have to say that the questions raised and dearth of answers is symptomatic of the point in history from which this story arises.It is unfortunate that the author chooses not place the events described in Northern Ireland in a fuller context as it can only lead to a charge of bias being placed against him.What cannot be denied though is that there have been dark forces at work in Northern Ireland on all sides. To take a step into this polluted morass requires both courage and scepticism in equal measure. To be fair to the author he has shown enough of both to make this book a worthy opening for a wider debate.You don't have to agree with him but surely in this modern, technologically global age the act of censorship is the bluntest and dullest of instruments with which to seek to silence him.A book which raises many questions but for which there are no adequate answers at this moment in time.Highly recommended."
1,Republican Propoaganda,"Another well constructed piece of Republican Propaganda. You have to hold up your hands up to the way in which he uses the situation in Northern Ireland to promote a one sided Republican view. It is a pity no one has done this from a loyalist perspective, highlighting the collusion that has existed between the IRA the Garda (Irish Police) and the Irish Government. Makes you think!"
2,"A Little Committee, A Lot of Court","This book was more about the court battle and the RUC/Loyalist/British(dis)information campaign than about the Committee, the Inner Circle or the Inner Force. I was disappointed. If you want to know the details of terrorism, only 20 or so pages are insightful. The rest is for those pursuing law degrees."
3,Average,The book is quite good in the story it tells.In this book as with all books it gives only one side ofthe story and does have some if not a lot of poetic lisence in it.
1,Cynical manipulation of genuine fears for easy money,I am open minded so I read this book. It is obviously intended for a non-Irish market because it is short on facts and evidence and long on suggestion and fantasy. I found it an interesting work of fiction though I suppose that's not the author's intention. It's a cynical rip-off using the fears of a sustantial part of the Irish population to generate a few dollars. The author has hit upon a tried and tested formula---don't let the facts get in the way of a good story. This book should receive a prize for fiction.
3,A Review of the Book - For a Change,"Most of the ""reviews"" above belong in a discussion forum and not here! I was not fortunate enough to see the CH 4 broadcast and bought the book due to the outcry I heard and expected a much more indebt look at the allegations, dirty tricks etc. The book is a bit disappointing if that is what the reader expects, as this content is limited and the bulk of the book is about the repercussions of the CH 4 broadcast. As a reader of law related books at least I am not too disappointed - I always find it interesting to see political interference in legal matters. I feel I was misled a bit - but still got a fairly decent read.Regarding the content, an examination of human nature would support the basic allegations made, but I remain unconvinced of the dept and degree - mine enemy's enemy and all that. I bought the book expecting to be provided with specific content supporting the allegations"
2,fantasy,"As one who knows the contributers to this book.I decided to read it,even after viewing the television programme on which the book is based. This book is long on fantasy and short on fact. The author states that ""the committee""consists of a large cross section of the protestant community,....strange he could not find more members of ""the committee""to add credability to his assertions. As a work of fiction I give the book two stars. p.s. Strangely enough this book seems to be aimed at the Irish American population who would have only scant knowledge of the subject matter.This book was not published in either the U.K. or Ireland."
1,Why rely on facts?,"An interesting book which was moulded by the dreams of twisted logic. With the $$millions that the writer has been libelled for on both sides of the Atlantic due to his unfounded accusations and the retraction by his ""source"", it is clear to see this was the work of a fantasist.No wonder this so-called journalists career was in tatters if he can't base an article on facts. Then again, why let the facts get in the way of a good story.About as realistic as Star Trek, without the glimpses of reality..."
4,Sinister by Far,"I am not a person to believe in conspiracy theories, however, as a citizen of Britain I have had a long suspicion that a collusion between the RUC and loyalist terrorist organisations has existed. I have had to put up with the threat of bombs being blown up around me all my life, even my home city of Manchester was destroyed three years ago, and frankly, anything suspicious about Northern Ireland, I believe. Mr. McPhilemy does give a very interesting account of how senior Ulster figures collude with filthy murderers, in order to kill innocents. I do believe this as his evidence is startling and convincing and the fact that the British Government has banned his book makes me even more convinced that it is true. Do by this book as it is very interesting and revealing. It is easy to get in England as I have found out. I would like to add that I am neither a republican nor a loyalist, I just believe that killing innocent people is not right."
1,Conspiracy Theorist Heaven.,"I read McPhilemy's book having read all the hype surrounding it here in Ulster, in light of the legal action being taken against it. To say it is the stuff of fantasy is an understatement. For so many people to have been involved, without being uncovered, beggars belief. His ""luck"" in finding a second source to support the fantasist Sands was truly amazing. It is just the sort of thing that happens every day in Ulster. There you are driving down the road, when a hitch hiker enters your car and admits to having been involved in a campaign of sectarian murder. I don't think so. This book has obviously been published for those sufficiently distant enough to not know the truth, or for those biased enough to want their suspicions confirmed. As a work of fiction 10/10, as a serious piece of investigative journalism 0/10."
2,"Misleading review, priced too high.","This CD consists of photographs taken from a Cessina (the wing tip appears at top of some pictures). There are brief, professional descriptions under the photos. CD includes maps & diagrams from a USGS phamplet & the magazine, ""Geology"". An analogy of ""nice project"" kept coming to mind. Photos and scans were 3-1/2"" by 2-1/2"". In order to see the detail, Zoom was required: however, a lot of detail was lost through enlargement. I would suggest a check of geologic sites on the Internet before investing in this CD. Nice try but very much overpriced."
4,Good White-Boy Funk,"As the title says, it's a bunch of white boys doing a credible version of rock-funk. It's not what I was expecting, but it is very enjoyable. NOT for hard-core P-Funk fans."
1,"Good idea, poorly executed","This is the type of case Garmin should have made for their units, and if they did I suspect it would be well made. Unfortunately the Gilsson case is quite poorly made. After 5 months of moderate use the stitching holding the screen window started to come apart. Gilsson said this was normal wear and tear and would not honor their warranty (and didn't bother to send the case back to me). Also the hole around the click stick was starting to tear and the velcro loop was starting to get warn."
2,not happy with this one,"My garmin does not line up well in the case. It is always off center. since I often use the USB cable, it is a chore to take it the GPS out of the case all the time. The front side thumb button doesn't like coming out of that hole. I will probably end up getting a different case in the near future."
1,Poor design.,"I tried getting this cover on my unit Vista HCx three times...it took that many attempts to get the buttons and windows even close to lining up. The lowest button on the left side doesn't even show up in the window. When trying to get the unit out of the cover, I noticed the stick was being pulled way out of its socket, certainly leading to a button failure in the near future. I won't put this thing on my unit again. I won't even try it in the field."
3,Protects casing but stitching doesn't last,"The soft spongy material used is pretty good for protecting the casing as well as the screen. But if you're using the metal D-ring (like with a carabiner), the stitching will not last. It took me 3 day hikes through the Malaysian rainforest before it half-tore.Now, I just use the casing for protection and put my carabiner through the velcro catch (which isn't designed very friendly, but the stitching there looks a fair bit tougher)."
3,"Works, but not always in the case right",This does the job it is desgned for but the GPS seems to work its way around in the case so the controls are never in the right spot.
5,Great Travel Table,"I have used this table for tailgating and as a stand for a small gas grill on my porch. It is really sturdy and stores very nicely. The top rolls up easily and fits in a bag about the size of a camping chair. This has been very handy, and a great purchase."
2,table isn't very strong,"This Serbian arm wrestling table isn't very strong at all, having watched two Serbs wrestle, I came to the conclusion that the table would break and it did, split right in half like a Russian bread loaf. First of all, Svendak and Kepak, who have beards and smelly breath, are big men, and their arms weigh a lot. The material in this table isn't that strong and it bends easily. I would suggest one use it for absolutely nothing or for storing feathers on top."
3,Definitely inspiring,"The first thing you notice about this book is the beautiful photographs. Unfortunately, I found the layout of the jewelry was more artistic than informative. Yes, they are creative jewelry, but you don't always get to see the whole piece. This is good for a beginner who wants to find inspiration. The directions are easy to understand. I came away with some great ideas that are not hard to make."
2,Did not gratify me,"If you are looking for a beautiful coffee table book, then this is the craft book for you. I enjoyed looking at the pictures. However, the instructions left a lot to be desired. There is one big picture of the end product on one page, and a lot of empty space on the opposite page. There are no step-by-step instructions. Therefore, I think this book was probably intended for someone that has experience making jewelry and can just look at the picture and make a project. I find that the whole ""instant gratification"" series is like this. I wouldn't recommend this book for new crafters, but it might appeal to others who can fill in the blanks with their own knowledge."
4,Eye Candy,"Full of beautiful pictures and very inspirational. Though the directions to the projects are lacking in technical clarity, they do give new thoughts and techniques to creating jewelry. Not a book for a beginer since the directions are much to brief and quite vague. I was disappointed that the resources were limited, only half were web based, and many did not have a comprehensive catalog on their website. In other words, the resources were not very 'user friendly'. I checked the book out at the library. All said, I find it necessary to buy the book for reference and ideas, partially due to the fantastic photos."
1,Lovely Photos.....not much else,This book has beatiful photographs - that's about it. The directions are poor and you cannot see the entire finished jewelry piece. This should have been a coffee table book.
1,You can definately do much better,"If you are a beginner, this book will not give you a good foundation to build upon. The instructions are poor, and not structured for the beginner. The photography is terrible. Most of the image is out of focus and will leave those with no prior experience with more questions than answers. I am glad I had the chance to page through this book before making the decision to purchase it. There are many more books out there with better instructions for beginners. Because of the poor photography, there isn't much to inspire those with any significant jewelry experience."
1,Disappointing,"I am an experienced beader always looking for new ideas. Initially I found the book appealing due to the photography. After closer examination, I found it to be lacking in technical detail. This is definetely not a book for beginners or someone looking for those quick, ""instant"" projects. Since detailed instructions are missing, good clear photography is necessary to get a good look at the projects. The ""artsy"" quality of these photos, some parts in focus, some out of focus, doesn't allow the beader a good look at the projects. This book is disappointing"
2,Out-of-Focus Photos Don't Equal Beauty,"There are some interesting ideas in this book, though none are particularly original. Unfortunately, almost every single photo has a large portion of the image out of focus. While this may be OK for artsy photography (though I would argue it isn't), it is terrible for jewelry instruction. In most cases, you cannot see what the item you are making is supposed to look like. Combine that with sometimes sparse directions and you end up with a book that is not very useful and not very inspirational. I am sorely disappointed!"
2,Not worth the money,"This is an 8 year old book and I know styles change. It may have been worth the money in 2000, but the jewelry is so very kindergarten-basic and styles are quite ancient. Most look like something a young girl would make in her Girl Scout group. I tossed the book an hour after I opened the package."
1,Didn't get the right toy...,"So I actually didn't order the toy that I ended up getting, I wanted the Doc Ock Set and got the Carnage set instead so I took My Biss. elsewhere. On the other hand, the Cos. service of the people that I had bought it from were wonderful and completely understood what happened and I am very happy about that, even tho it was a mistake they still were very nice about it.Lance"
4,DMC3 rocks,"The story for DMC3 has more depth than previous games in the series. It explains about the relationship about Dante and Vergil and more about the amulets that they both carry. There is also a larger variety of Devil Arms for the player to use as they progress through the game. The player is also able to play as Vergil, but it's the same missions as for Dante, except Vergil's don't have cutscenes. The special edition version also allows the player to go through boss battles with Jester during the game."
4,Great Renditions of Stories Ahead of Their Time,"Anthony Trollope was remarkable, a man who understood feminist issues before there was a name for them. His female characters are often strong and sympathetic, and his insight into social issues made his novels more than ordinary potboilers. I do prefer the novels, where Trollope's wit and sometimes snide observations give depth to every scene. But every one of these elegantly filmed stories offers a long, luxurious look into a world long gone, and is perfect for a long lounge before the fire on a dismal day."
4,Great Collection of BBC Drama,"Loved this collection though not quite Dickensonian in flavor. My personal favorite is 'The Barchester Chronicles'. Characters have depth and nuances that keep you watching for hours on end. least favorite? 'He Knew He Was Right'. More somber and dark than I like. 'The Way We Live Now' at least had some comic relief, and was superbly acted. Great story lines."
2,The Anthony Trollope Collection (The Barchester Chronicles / He Knew He Was Right / The Way We Live Now),"I was not as impressed with this trio as I was with the ""Elizabeth Gaskell Collection"".""The Barchester Chronicles"" was a much older and poorer production. The characters were way to stereotypical and cardboard as to be unbelievable, the virtuous and the vile. ""The Way We Live Now"" was the best of the three. ""He Knew He Was Right"" is a discourse in frustration to anyone who has an ounce of ability for conflict resolution, but that must be blamed on the writer, not the actors and producers.More than anything I came away with the impression that Trollope was an idiot."
1,Extremely Disappointing,"I ordered this collection based on the good reviews on this site and I was very, very disappointed in the product. I watched The Way We Live Now from beginning to end and it was awful. The acting was terrible (especially the main character who had all the money and his daughter) and the storylines were disjointed and just plain weird. Three times I have tried to watch He Knew He Was Right, but it was so bad that I stopped the DVD about 15 minutes into the program. I've tried to watch The Barchester Chronicles and fell asleep within 5 minutes. This collection is not worth the money I spent on it."
3,The Way We Live Now,The Anthony Trollope Collection (The Barchester Chronicles / He Knew He Was Right / The Way We Live Now)I was very disappointed in the movie The Way We Live Now. The story line was not that interesting. The DVD quality was outstanding though. Just the movie itself was boring. My daughter watched the 3 part series with me and she didn't really like it.I really enjoyed He Knew He Was Right. This was an excellent movie and story line. It was not predictable. My daughter also watched this one with me and we would watch it again. Very enjoyable.
4,miss this show,"This is one of my all time favorite shows. I got to thinking about it lately and was thrilled that Amamzon has some videos. (Would be helpful if a synopsis of the video was included on the order page.)Maurice is at his egotistical self-important best here as he throws the party to end all parties, or as Ruth Ann says, ""an homage to himself."" We also see the return of Adam and Eve--a priceless couple. Seeing them was well worth the price of the video.I would love to see a video of the episode where Maggie has yet another boyfriend die on her. This guy was killed by a fallen satellite and the casket had all sorts of satellite things spoking out from it. One of the funniest things I've ever seen on TV. Think it was from the first season, don't know name of episode and I don't get the reruns here. Also would like to see the one where Adam and Eve are introduced and Joel is stranded with them, I think."
4,She is pretty and well worth the money.,"I love her dress,it is exquisite and I have never seen anything like it.I love the design,designs are something I look at when purchasing a Barbie."
3,From Back Cover,"DO YOU HAVE A SECRET FANTASY?Drew Townsend does. And in his secret fantasy Laura Nolan returnss. Three years ago, she ran away, leaving her engagement ring and a useless little note. Laura had told him to get on with his life, meet other women and forget her. And he had... except fo the last part.Then one day Laura does come back, but not to him. She comes back to find out what secrets lay buried in her past - a past she can't really remember.Maybe once she remembers, she can get on with her life. And maybe, just maybe, that life can include Drew.[1st in the Secret Fantasies series]"
2,Disappointed,"I usually love drop bottom duffle bags. I had one from Eddie Bauer that lasted 12 yrs and many trips. I had this 2 yrs but only used the bag for 4 trips in the US. The wheels collapsed on my 2nd trip and I can't really roll the bag well. Probably due to airline handling, but still is disappointing that it didn't hold up."
1,Don't buy,This luggage only made one trip then the wheel broke and created a hole in the plastic. The suitcase is not designed right it can't handle any weight without the wheels braking.
2,Where's the beef!,"The runtime of this video is fify-five minutes. Thirty-five of those cover Gerry Brown's bio and music played onsite at a Mars Music superstore. The twenty minutes of instruction are targetted towards accomplished drummers looking for some insight into the Motown beat. The patterns he demonstrates are heavily influenced by Stevie Wonder compositions. Even if this is what you're looking for, your money would be better spent with the purchase of Motown CDs. This tape I found to be a great disappointment because of the cost versus instruction time."
5,This is one good product,"I've been using Formby's for 20 years an find it to be consistently one of the best. I like the low gloss because I can control the degree of ""glossiness"" as each additional coat adds to the ""depth"" of the gloss."
2,National Geographic Antarctic Wildlife Adventure,"Beautiful shots of Antarctic scenery don't save this information-free documentary -- after all, tons of films on Antarctica show beautiful scenes.The film is basically about a family, complete with three children, who sail around the Antarctic peninsula to survey birds and perform other studies. Viewers learn almost nothing about the wildlife or the ecology being studied. As an example, most of the birds and sea mammals appearing on the screen are never identified by the narrator, and at one point cormorants are implicitly misidentified as penguins. The existence of this naturalist family is treated as a gimmick, apparently being supposed to engage interest on its own. For me, anyway, it doesn't."
1,Not what I expected.,"I purchased this book due to an interest I have in the Special Air Service. The book was not what I expected, I thought it would show some moves used by the elite troops of the SAS, it doesn't. The book is more focused on everyday life, situations that might arise etc (gang fighting for example).Of the self-defense tactics shown in the book I found none of them to be new to me. Its mostly common sense actions put into a book, Cleary by using the SAS label they thought they would sell more books.1 Star, go join a self defense class, its good exercise and far more educational then any book on the subject."
3,A new approach to Beethoven,"This is for sure a new and interesting approach to Beethoven's symphonies,in new critical editions, but this fact doesn't make them necessarily betteror more enjoyable. Zinman's just proposes another valid , but NOT definitiveapproach to these works. Perhaps the weakest point in this cycle is aproblematic seventh that doesn't fit very well."
4,r,This was a hard book to understand. Some I had no trouble but I am so glad I got it. I would still recomend to everyone.
4,Not radical enough,"I'm reviewing this one that I read several years ago - in prep for a Monday night discussion with a couple of friends. It is indeed, as others have said, the right direction. How can we ever come together, if it is not around the scripture. The only thing I have against this one is that at the end of the book LaGard seems to pull back from his recommendations.Check this out:A Call to Arms! Out of the Pews and Into the Streets"
3,"Very pretty, but poor construction","The case is made of gorgeous soft leather. It's both beautiful and classy-looking. The magnetic fastener is neat.Unfortunately, the swivels feel (and are) flimsy. They came apart the first day. I had to rebuild them using a liquid nut-lock to keep them from coming loose. The head of the screw that holds the two parts of the swivel together is just a tad wider than the hole that keeps it from slipping through. I'm expecting the screw to work its way through the hole any day.The strap is very thin and doesn't look like it will hold up for long.If you plan to suspend this case from your belt, you may be disappointed. If you have more elegant plans for it, you might be satisfied."
4,beautiful,"I love it. Phone fits nice, the magnetic clasp makes it easy to answer in a hurry. It would be nice to have a belt clip also. I can put it on my belt loop but it flops around when I walk. But it looks nice and is covenient when hooked on my purse."
1,Just plain awful,"I bought this game looking for a fun alternative to intensive flight simulators AND simple arcade style games... I thought it would be a good compromise. Unfortunately, It's not good in either respect. Do yourself a favor, don't spend anything on it. Soooo boring, it's tedious and the graphics are terrible.And as far as multiplayer benefits, (free access, etc.) once I played the game I understood why. Nobody would pay for this garbage."
3,"Good introductory history, but suffers from poor editing.","Good introductory history, with the 'fact windows' of particular interest. However, the overall quality of the book is diminished by too many factual errors and poor editing. For example, Ross refers to King John Balliol's reign beginning in 1292 after ""ten kingless years"" (p. 78) when it had been only six years since King Alexander III had died, though this was probably confused with the ten kingless years after Balliol was deposed in 1296. There are other mistakes like this, in addition to sentence fragments, that better editing would have corrected."
5,Great Little known movie!!,This is a great little known football movie about a football quarterback's drug and alcohol problems and his father's efforts to get him on the right track.It's a must see!!
4,"Helpful for beginning, I hope","This was my first Perl book. At the time I was first using it, I barely knew what programming was(not that I do now). The examples helped me solve many problems, but they were solved the way the author would have solved them. The other reviewers are right, there are errors in the examples, but despite that, the book gave me what I hope to be a good first look at how problems can be solved. I have since moved on to Programming Perl, and Advanced Perl Programming(both O'Reilly). If it wasn't for the examples in Quigley's book, I wouldn't have the background for the kinds of problems I solve today. I recommend the book."
4,Well designed book,"I read this on itlibrary.com, so I can't say anything about the cd but I can say it was a good book. The use of examples put the things learned to use instead of letting people ask ""So what? "". However, I think more attention should've been spent on sockets, and nothing on named pipes was mentioned. Overall this is a good reference and is great for someone just starting to learn perl, or a unix guy wanting to know more functions and how to use them."
2,"Great at first glance, but actually not","Perl by Example seems to be great at first glance, but actually it's not, when you read carefully into it.The author tried to use examples to illustrate her ideas. However, due to the enormous amount of errors in the examples, I can hardly trust them. I'm wondering whether the author has tried her code on a real machine. Or maybe the code worked at a certain point, but got changed during the author's revision or printing. Thanks to my background in C/C++, I can identify some errors easily. Yet there may be more errors that I didn't realize. Here are some of the examples in the book that either don't work at all, or don't give the output as described: Ex4.49, Ex5.12, Ex 6.21, Ex6.32, Ex7.5, Ex7.9, Ex7.18.Overall, I don't recommend the book to anyone taking Perl as the first programming language. If you have some background in other programming language, and would like to think about how to fix code in the textbook and play around, it's the book for you."
1,Kindle Version,"I got the Kindle version. It did not come with the CD-ROM data nor was one able to download the CD-ROM data from the web-site. Additionally, one cannot cut and paste data from the Kindle web reader. That means that all the sample code has to be typed by hand. For simple data files to be used as examples to manipulate, this is very tedious. I would not waste my time on the kindle version of this book. (The book is excellent so far.) Get the hard copy that comes with the CD-ROM."
3,"OK, but not the best book on Perl","I bought this book hoping to get a broader view on Perl from that given in ""The Perl CD Bookshelf"". Although it somehow does, I seldom find my self searching items in this book. As a recommendation, I would suggest that you do not buy this book if you have doubts about it. Do not get me wrong, it is OK, but I prefer the one mentioned above."
4,Good book for Perl beginners,"As an experienced programmer, I first tried to learn Perl by reading the Camel book (1st edition), but found it tough going. This book practically 'holds your hand' by guiding you through the fundumentals with simple examples and explanations. As a beginners book I'm sure its as good as any other on the market. I still use it as a reference. The turorial on the included CD Rom didn't add much value though - poor sound quality and pretty boring."
2,Tutorial? maybe. Reference? no.,"If you are going to buy many books on Perl this might be one to buy early. It plods through some simple examples.If you only plan to buy one Perl book, keep looking. This is not a good reference. You only get glimpses of topics, and information is hard to find.If you only want to learn enough perl to solve a particular problem, keep looking, unless of course your problem happens to be like one of the examples."
2,Examples from Perl by Example,"The blurb on the cover of the 3rd edition said: ""Full cross-platform coverage... including Windows and Macintosh."" If you think you will not need Unix knowledge, take a look at this example from page 52:The $_ Scalar Variable: ""... When used as a pattern space for searches, it behaves like sed. When used to hold the current line, it is like the $0 variable in awk.""If this is clear to you, buy the book."
5,Perl by Example,"Clealy written, and in terms I believe are easily understood by programmers.Also, wonderful price! (under $2.00)"
5,Perl script examples,"If you are looking for a book that provides Perl script examples, then this is the book for you. Provides numerous examples of perl scripts in each section, plus then the author breaks down line by line what the script does. I use this book in conjunction with O'Reilly's Learning Perl."
3,Nothing to get excited about,"As a programmer experienced with Java and C, I needed to learn PERL for a new project. I started out with this book and I'm finding it acceptable, but not great. It certainly has enough examples, but the actual presentation of the language was lacking. It relies far too heavily on examples for me, and reading through hundreds of examples has turned out to be a frustrating and difficult way to learn. I think I'm going to try a different book and hope for something better."
2,Useless -- don't waste your money or time,"Learing to code requires that you be able to practice what you've just read. This book offers no excersies thus the reader is left to stumble along on their own. The examples are limited and simplistic, and, considering that the book is designed for beginners, it lacks teaching of proper programming fundementals. I don't recommend this book either for begginer's or as a perl referenece manual"
3,"An okay book. Not to be confused with ""Perl 5 By Example.""","After picking up a copy of this book after having read glowing reviews of ""Perl 5 By Example,"" I realized I'd purchased a completely different volume. After my initial anger at my carelessness that two books would share such similar titles, I started reading and found it's actually not so terrible. The biggest problem for Perl initiates will be the occasional referencing of features that aren't explained until later chapters. The author seems to assume User knowledge of UNIX commands, though that wasn't much of a hinderance. Overall, I think my good feelings about the experience are more related to Perl than about the book. Just be aware if someone recommends ""Perl by Example"" that they may be talking about ""Perl 5 by Example."" One of the publishers needs to change this in the next release."
2,Can do better,The examples in the book are tedious and not real-world. Some of the code doesn't work. There are some helpful things but get the O'Reilly books instead.
2,Lacking worthwhile content,"I have recently picked up photography, and I have bought a few books along the way. One of them is a 35mm photography book by Kodak (the name slips my mind). It's not a bad first book, and should be considered is you are a novice.Then I bought this book. It was recommended to me by my photography college. While the book has a sprinkling of nice photos, the text that goes along with it has nothing much going for it. For most areas, it tends to glance over the topic without any really useful tips. I suggest that all potential buyers have a flick through it first before purchasing, as it may not be all it's cracked up to be.The book that all novice/amateur photographers should be reading is ""National Geographic Photography Field Guide: Secrets to Making Great Pictures"". This book by far is most useful for all photographers. That's definitely a five star book."
5,Was required for my photography class,"Currently taking a Intro to Photography class and my instructor insisted that we get this book. Though it is a bit old 1998, and does not refer to digital cameras a great read. To make up for no digital reference we are also reading a book by Scott Kelby, the Digital photographer. Buy the book used, I spent $3.10 and it looks as good as new."
1,"Just many pictures. Nice to sell, actually nothing to read","Well, I've bought the book because of descriptioin that promised to cover almost every field in photography. Actually, each of those 65 ""projects"" is exactly one page, filled with 4 or 5 author's photographs and 1-2 paragaphs of text.The author did not actually write a book - he just browsed his heap of older photos, selected some and dropped some words to each page.Good ""chapter"" names cover all major topics of interest, but there are no chapters themselves - just some words that tell you nothing but something very generic.Author's ego is something really tremendous. Each photo commented ""why this is good"", and there is no single photo of other photographer and no single photo that the author would not treat as good."
3,"Ok, but......","Ok book, but I expected much more. The ""assignments"" don't really explain what is expected! I'm looking for a better book to help me grow."
2,not for kids who like history,"My daughters love biographies, especially those done by Diane Stanley. This is not really a biography. It has some historical information in it, but really it is just some facts strung together in an annoying rhyme. My oldest (7) thought the illustrations were absurd. The figures look like they are being viewed in a carnival mirror, wide and short with very large heads. Sir Francis Drake is an interesting and controversial character in history and deserves a better telling of his story."
1,Overly simplified - don't use,"Be careful using this. It really is just a light skimming of basic code, usually not drawn out into enough detail to keep you out of trouble. It is more like someone's handwritten notes of common questions, not at all at 'authoratative' level that a 'code check' type of title might lead you to believe. You could maybe catch basic violations of someone else's work, but do not use it to convince yourself that someone else did their work correctly, and do not use it as a guide in your own work."
2,Out of Date,"The ad did not specify that this guide is over 15 years old. Codes have changed dramatically, so this does not serve me well. It was priced so low, that I can't afford to return it."
4,"Nice set, but check the weight of the chips","This is a very nice set, much better than those plastic chips that are basically junk. However, the weight of the chips is only 7.5g, not the more standard 11.5g or casino weight 14g. If I had known that in advance, I may have passed. That being said, this is a very nice set. Dealer and Blind buttons, dice, cards, and the heavy duty case are well worth what I paid for it (fifteen plus free S&H!), but the chips themselves are just a little on the light side. If you don't mix them with heavier chips, you may never notice the difference, but I noticed it right away."
4,"crispy clean but light fragrance,","I got this fragrance for my friend ,she liked it ,its light and crispy clean fragrance is a perfect all time wear and is good for all ages."
5,Love it!,Very Nice... Very nice... Very nice!! Very nice.... Very nice! Very Nice. Very Nice. Nice scent. Light and lucious. Can wear everyday.
4,It's nice,"I recommend it to those who love floral perfumes, it reminds me of one very floral scent from givenchy -an old one... don't remember the name. Yes, certainly good choice, but not for me - for my mom, as she loved the fresh smell of givenchy's Fleur D'interdit (searched for the name for you :) ) I hope this review helps u to make the right choice.Thanks amazon"
1,Wastage of money,"This is not good perfume at all. It's fragrance goes off immediately soon after you put it. It's utter wastage of money, really disappointed with it."
5,A sympathetically written work,This is a sympathetically written account of the major Diasporas the Jewish people have known in their four- thousand year history. Comay nicely concludes with a book with a chapter on 'the ingathering' in the modern state of Israel.
3,shampoo review,"Works okay, I guess. For a serious problem I recommend using essential oils. They might get you better results. This is all ."
4,Fix the flaws to perfect,"This game is very good. The graphics are very good, and you have complete power. The one problem is, when your being a skier you can't go on lifts. I think it would be better if you could. Also all ski school instructors do is teach people the ""sideways walk""(a way to climb up on skis). The trails also are easy. Fix those flaws though, and you have a perfect game."
2,Should Barack Obama Be President?,Disappointing. Information wasn't very current and didn't provide a better perspective than the media during the campaign.
3,Simply Strength,I have been working out with Kathy Smith around 20 years. This particular DVD is simply strength training; broken down into 4 15-minute sessions that include a brief yet sufficient warm up. (This time does not include the stretching cool-down. Allow more time for that.) I was disappointed in this DVD because (based on other reviews) I was anticipating the inclusion of cardio as well as strength training which would make it a complete workout. Because it does NOT have cardio involved in the workout I cannot use this DVD alone for my daily exercise routine. If you're looking for strength training alone this is most definitely a functional workout.
1,"Both DVD's received were faulty, one having a big scratch on the back!","Very disappointed that I cannot purchase a copy of this DVD that actually plays ~ and yes, I have tried it on two different dvd players that both have no problem with any other dvds - is it possible I just was unlucky enough to have received the only two faulty dvd's? I guess it is possible, but pretty unlikely I would think! Where are these being made is my question?"
3,Ageless?,"I bought this DVD believing it would be challenging, but not more difficult than I could handle. While I could do most of the exercises, the video didn't seem to flow really well and I would not recommend it, especially for anyone over 55 who needs to modify their workout."
5,very nice,"This one is a great dvd. I especially love the legs, butt, and arms segments. I do not enjoy ab segment on this one cause it's too monotonous and tough on my neck. Her Tummy Trimmers dvd provides better ab workouts. But overall, it is a great workout."
4,Good Exercise Video,"I have only used this exercise video a couple of times, because I got so sore each time. I think if you aren't in bad shape it would be a good one to use. I eventually hope to be in good enough shape to use this video without my body aching the next day. I have been a fan of Kathy Smith for a long time. She is in great shape. So I would recommend this video for people that have already been doing a little exercise. I wouldn't recommend it for a very out of shape beginner, though."
3,"Kathy Smith Looks Great, but I'm too klutzy for the moves","Kathy Smith is a fitness icon, and she has stayed in superb shape. Given her age, (fifties) I anticipated her moves might be more gentle, but this DVD shows she's as agile as a thirty year old. Not me. I had a hard time following some of the moves, so the three star rating reflects this DVDs usefulness to me. If you're in good shape, go for it. If you're a klutz, or on the soift side of fifty try Leslie Sansone or Jane Fonda."
2,Why change a good thing.,When i first heard the 2000 release i was hooked. This second 2005 release is nothing like the first. WAAAAY more like Dido. I myself favor the 2000 release. The 2000 release is a 5 out of 5. This is only a 2 out of 5. The two albums don't even sound alike.
4,Strategic lesson: how to start with leverage and move anything,"Leverage is a useful way of thinking about how to gain the advantage in a negotiation, but the concept is essentially a crystallization of what good negotiators have been doing for centuries. Author Roger Volkema does an especially fine job in two areas: useful examples and methodical explanation of your options. He classifies common power plays into types that you can identify, practice and counter. He provides examples of each type drawn from real experience and the popular media. The result is easy to read, understand and apply. The book would have been even stronger if he had added more that was new, if he had grappled more directly with situations where the parties lack leverage and if he had gone further on such matters as ethical negotiation. Yet, as noted, we praise his examples and strategies, and recommend this book to people who want to improve their negotiating skills."
2,Colors not accurate,"This paper is fairly heavy, good quality wrapping paper, but in person the colors are not as vivid as shown in the picture. Like others have said, the gift tags are nice and bright, but because of the difference in color, they don't match the actual paper. The paper is rather drab. It's definitely not worth $4.95 for 4 sheets."
4,What about Jean?,"1930s Steppin Out Barbie, with her long clinging gown chiffon wrap looks quite like 1930s star Jean Harlow. Harlow made the short platinum look popular and Barbie pulls it off just as well."
5,Awesome!!,951 questions and answers!! This book was essential to my passing the NCBTMB the first time. I learned a great deal from this book and well as from Volumes 2 and 3. I was surprised at the number of test questions about Traditional Chinese Medicine. This book provides a great deal of information on that topic.
5,Wonderful Tool,I only ordered volume 1 of this set of 3. I felt that this area is where I needed to review the most. The book is a little less than 1000 questions and answers. I felt that it was extremely helpful and I would recommend it to anyone taking this exam. I passed on the high end of 4 out of the 6 sections of the exam! I wasn't sure at first about purchasing because of the amount but I took a chance and now feel that it was well worth it.
2,A Typical Romance Novel,"I was disappointed in this book. I thought I'd be reading a deep, book about female burdens in the Middle East. Instead, I get a Danielle Steel type novel. The perfect marriage turns sour when the husband starts coming in late, telling lies, etc. If you like that type of story, you'll like this one but I'm not a romance novel fan."
4,A Must read for Iranian-American people,"I read Foreigner and Married to a Stranger a few years ago. I borrowed them from the public library (for people who can't find these books to buy, they are available at the public library) and I am planning to re-read them again. I wish there were more books such as Nahid's available in the market. The Iranian Americans are newer immigrants and we do need to read and write and self discover ourselves in the new land in order to be able to understand our complexities and adjust to our new situations. This market without a doubt will be much richer in the future."
4,A New Perspective,"Larry Cebula offers a thoughtful, insightful look on the Plateau Indians of Northwest U.S. and Canada. Instead of a mere recitation of facts, this history focuses on the spiritual life of the Indians of that period, and how their spirituality drove their relationship with the whites moving into the area. A must-read for anyone interested in American history."
1,Save your money,This is a very poor indication of the American Indian's quest for spiritual power. I was expecting something a little more based on hard factual information. I found the book disappointing. I expected some more colorful examples to support it's thesis. Save your money. A book like The spiritual Legacy of The American Indian might be a better choice.The Spiritual Legacy of the American Indian: Commemorative Edition with Letters while Living with Black Elk (The Perennial Philosophy Series)
4,Works pretty well on aphids,"Been using it on some broccoli and cabbage plants infested with aphids, Works pretty well but I keep having to reapply. Controls the population."
2,Killed my Plants!,I've never used chemicals for my plants so I was very careful with this product. I like to keep my small garden 100% organic. I had problem with spider mites and my traditional methods didn't work well so I decide to buy something for organic gardening.This spray killed 3 of my plants!! Leaves turned black and dry after few hours I sprayed them!!!I don't know if it's my bad luck ... but I don't believe that this spray is safe. Not recommended!At least shipping was fast - that's why 2 stars ...
4,works on mealy bugs,I didnt get a chance to try it for mites...but it works on mealy bugs ...without burning your plants. I had some delicate succulents and tomatoe plants that got INFESTED with mealy bugs.....you have to use ALOT and make sure to get it on them.....but it doesnt seem to effect the plant.....seems like a natural insecticide.
2,results don't last,"I hosed my plants down with this, as instucted, but didn't see much change. It may have worked for a few days, but the same bugs came right back. With this costing as much as it does, it needs to work for way longer than a few days per application. The bottle isn't very big either, considering you have to saturate the plants completely with this stuff. I may have been able to get 4 applications out of the one bottle."
1,Insect-killing Soap,"I'm disappointed in this product. I ordered it because tiny gnats entered my home through my screened windows this summer. They set up house in my potted plants. Not liking strong chemicals for many reasons, I first tried a solution of Dawn and water in a spray bottle with little success. When I found this product on Amazon, I was pleased. The gnats by that time were noticeably larger and more abundant. I was unable to allow any fruit to ripen outside of the refrigerator. Using this product, I observed two things: the flying bugs weren't dying and the solution was staining my light-colored walls. I've been unable to remove the running stains by gentle care so I have to try something stronger. Because the walls have been painted with flat paint, I haven't wanted to use anything strong.I hope you have better results if you order this product. Perhaps my mistake was in using it indoors instead of outdoors. After all, the gnats (very tiny flying insects) came from outdoors!"
4,careful with this,I used this to kill aphids on my indoor mint plant. Although its soap and some mild insecticide it killed parts of the leaves on some of the plants. I saw that this was happening in areas where the liquid collected on the dripping side of leaves. If it sits long enough it will kill that part of the leafs. I suggest spraying letting it sit for ten minutes and then brushing the plant with a paper towel to remove the excess drips.Also this worked really well in getting rid of 95% of the aphids. It makes pests manageable. I'm sure if I applied this once a week like it asks then it should get rid of it all. I try not to use it unless the aphids get out of control due to the spray damaging leaves if its left it gathers and left too long and wet.
1,Damaged My Plants Also,I followed the directions and applied lightly to a couple of my plants the other night. I woke up in the morning and the leaves and flowers were dead. Another thing is the product smells toxic and made me choke. I searched a long time for a product I was led to believe was effective and safe. This product is neither safe or effective . I should have just purchased some regular name brand bug killer and not gambled with this too good to be true junk.
4,good but inconsistent,"The product worked well, I could get rid of red mites on my roses. Mites are difficult to get rid of, but after several treatments the roses were fine.Unfortunately, after a month mites came back, but by that time the product was already over. I used another soap, and finally the plants look good."
1,Wish I could have given it a 0 start rating,"Bottom line is that it just does not work. It does not mask your IP on any site other than the one that they have conviently setup to test the display of your IP. They have a 100% 90 day money back guarantee, but no phone number to request such. So far, no luck getting a response back from their site for money back.DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY !!!"
1,Review,"This woman is a local here. She has THE MOST AMAZING VOICE EVER. I first saw her at a local bar that was having a charity event for tornado victims. SHE ROCKED THE HOUSE DOWN. She open fir BB King at the BB King Blues Festival and deserved that spot tenfold! Very deep bluesy gospel. This CD does her NO JUSTICE whatsoever! Poor quality sound, not her standard gig of music....I was incredible disappointed in this. It doesnt even deserve the one star rating, but I had to give it something to publish."
5,A huge Step forward for the Street Dogs,"This cd is absolutely amazing. The dogs have created a cd where every song on the album is brilliant. Every song is written and played with heart and soul. The standouts would be sell your lies, final transmission and fading american dream. If you love smart punk, get this cd!"
3,"decent music, bad message","The music itself isn't too bad. I bought the album becuase I was looking for ""Not Without A Purpose"" and for some reason, you cannot buy the mp3 off of Amazon or iTunes, and I am not one to pirate music. So I bought the CD just for that song. That song is awesome and is a good way to get pumped up; however, as expected, the rest of the album (with a few exceptions) is strongly neo-liberal. I am not surprised by this becasue of the aptly named album and the album cover. I do chose to not listen to those songs, but the 2 or 3 that I do enjoy make the product a worth while purchase. So all in all, i found the song I was looking for, so I am pleased with that at least."
1,not the book,"I was trying to order the book ""Brenner & Theodore, Eds. (2002). Spaces of neoliberalism"" and found this digital download on Amazon. Same authors, same pub date, same title... I figured it was the book and ordered it. Was I surprised when my e-doc turned out to be a one page synopsis of the book written in Spanish? WTF? Now I can't find anywhere on the Amazon site to complain or ask for a refund. I suppose I should have read all the details about the e-doc, but since looked exactly like the book I ordered it."
1,A Poor Survey,"This book is a very uneven and poorly executed survey of standard cosmology based on Big Bang and Inflation theories. My background is theoretical physics and I am conversant with General Relativity, Fluid Mechanics etc. Nevertheless, I found this book at times incomprehensible and impenetrable.The book covers some areas in great detail such as the early chapters on cosmological models but some other topics, such as the rate equations, are so poorly written that they could perhaps make sense only to an expert (And if so, why would an expert want to read this book?)The observational treatment is cursory and the book's physical insights are obscured in the text.I cannot recommend this book, I suggest Steven Weinberg's ""Cosmology"" book instead."
1,Inferior to the VX 900-2,"I have been using the VX900-2 for over a year. It was excellent. Recently I replaced it with a VX910, assuming that the newer monitor would be as good as or better than the earlier one. I was wrong. The overall picture quality of the VX910 is a real disappointment, especially the colors. The VX910 has too much of a blueish overcast, making flesh tones look pallid and washed out. None of the colors look natural, rich, or vibrant. They look harsh and faded. The VX900 colors do not have this problem. Also, the VX910 pixels are visibly obtrusive, which they are not on the VX900. I tried to configure the VX910 in every possible way, but I was unable to make any satisfactory adjustment. After using the VX910 for two days, I returned it to the store and replaced it with a new VX900. It is excellent. I strongly urge any buyer to compare the VX900 to the VX910 before buying the latter."
4,"Decent 19"" LCD for a decent price","I bought this monitor to replace 7 year old CRT and so farI am happy with my decision.Pros:* This is a decent 19"" LCD monitor for a decent price.* I mainly use PC at home to surf web and watch movies. This monitor is good enough for that.* It is made by viewsonic and did not have any dead pixels.Cons:* only 1 year warranty.* cable for digital input not provided."
5,Absolutely Hilarious,"The problem with having both in the house at the same time is that, once you start watching, you'll just spend the whole day parked in front of the screen. This is the most amazingly entertaining TV that, perhaps, has ever been created. Season One, Episode One needs about half the show to hit its stride, and after than that it's all just awesome.Just to keep it irrelevant, Germaine Greer is the best gladioli thrower of them all. Grab it by the stem, bottom in the front and flower in the back, and she looked like Atalanta tossing javelins at the Olympic Games. In year two, Dolph Lundgren used the same technique. These DVDs are, as you may have guessed, five-star and ""keeper"" and all my other superlatives."
4,blast fron the past,"I remember watching Dame Edna specials many years ago - I just hadn't remembered how long ago it really was. Still, the humor comes through without feeling very dated. My 15-year old son sat down to watch a couple episodes of The Dame Edna Experience (talk show) with my wife and me and enjoyed it, even though he didn't know who most of the guests were (heck, I didn't even know some of them).Technically, the video quality was quite good - they must have remastered the recordings. A definite thumbs up!"
3,A lot of money for a few laughs,"Sheesh! This is an overpriced box collection for some old television shows from the 80's! Dame Edna can be very entertaining - at times - but some of these interviews just go on forever and are quite tedious. Jokes are repeated; some of the ""celebrity"" guests are unknown on this side of the Atlantic (Cynthia Payne?? Apparently a brothel keeper in London? There was also another woman here who ran a small morals crusade in Thatcher UK in the 80's but who I never heard of and I doubt that any other American has heard of). Awful moments include: Jeri Hall (attache' of Mick Jagger) in a gold lame' cowboy outfit croaking her way through, ""Stand by your man."" Dame Edna singing - anything. Rent this one on Netflix. It isn't worth the 55$."
1,Save Your Money!,"This movie was bad and never got any better. The acting is bad, the editing was bad, even the colors were bad! Save your money and rent something else!"
3,"For the money, it's OK","I bought this case while I wait for the release of one of higher quality. Yes, it works--it provides adequade protection for my 2G Nano. However, it may require some slight modification. For example, I had to trim the access hole on the top so I could more easily turn the lock on and off. Also, I had to trim the bottom slot so the headphone jack would fully seat. I ordered the XtremeMac Microshield from Amazon, and when I ships, I'll probably junk this case. For the cost, and with a few tweeks, it's a good case."
5,great for stuff [good case for the price],it's a nice well made case and it will protect the ipod very well. it helps people solve probelms with out this life saving tool i would be died`~`BUY IT- If you buy this you'll get thiscase+$$$=happy
2,Sad to see him go - even sadder to hear him sing,"OK - let me preface my comments by justifying the 2-star rating...It's Rodney Dangerfield - he was a class act. As for the CD: If you're looking for a few songs by a comedian accompanied by someone's cheesy clavinova, then this CD is for you. I bought this because of the last track, ""Rappin' Rodney"", and boy was I disappointed. It sounds like it was recorded from an old worn out cassette. Do yourself a favor - get all of Rodney's DVD's with his standup material and remember him for what he was - a comedy legend."
2,Rodney Respectfully Croons Some Tunes,"Rodney Dangerfield has sung songs in some of his movies, most notably the animated ""Rover Dangerfield"" and ""The 4th Tenor."" Except for the last bonus track, all of the songs on this album were recorded from 2000 to 2004, when Rodney was old and in failing health. His version of ""Strangers In The Night"" does not compare favorably to Frank Sinatra's version, while the remix version of that tune is even worse. Rodney's song selection is somewhat strange, covering the religious hymns ""I Believe"" and ""He."" He's more enjoyable to listen to when he's singing the upbeat ""I Spent My Birthday In Las Vegas"" and ""Rappin' Rodney,"" the title song taken from his 1983 comedy album. Rodney's even more enjoyable to listen to when he's telling jokes!"
2,very poor recording quality,"Unfortunately, the swinging arrangements and singing are defeated by the extremely poor recording quality. The bass sounds like a dull thud, hardly distinguisable from the bass drum. By far the worst recorded cd I've every purchased. What a shameful representation of such talented jazz artists. Momad is a label I will avoid in the future."
1,Stick With BH and the OPT,"First off, this CD is inexcusably short, if I remember correctly something like 22 minutes in length. (I can't remember because I hardly ever play it anymore, and no CD buy-back store will even touch it!) Henderson is hoarse and oftentimes out of breath during the songs. The only bright spot is ""Who Can I Turn To?"" Otherwise, avoid this CD. Stick with Bill Henderson and the Oscar Peterson Trio (one of my favorites).But, hey, don't avoid the Monad label altogether. Granted, this one is poor, but their CD of ""Joe Williams Live In Vegas"" sounds great, swings like mad and is an absolute joy to listen to."
2,CD lacks umph! and swing,"This CD shows none of Henderson's umph and swing. Blah! Henderson cut a lot of records, and this collects his blandest ballads"
2,Consider this a good quality Disposable unit,"I am already on my second unit. I managed to get three uses out of the first one. I should have ordered the second when I saw the first one start smoking halfway through draining the turkey fryer. (No, the oil was not hot, it was at room temp.!) THe only reason I gave a second star is that it did work well, once. I really wish Eastman would re-design this to make it durable. I've given up and use PVC tubing from Home depot and a funnel with cheesecloth to get the residuals out. Good luck to anyone who wants to use this a second time!"
2,Works with reservation,"This pump is a step backwards from the previous two battery version (this one has three batteries). The additional battery make it too heavy on the top so it doesn't sit well in the pot. It has a tendency to tip over, or at least shift from the position you set it at.I would agree with some of the other reviews that it seems to loose power after the first use. The thicker the oil, the harder a time it has. If you heat the oil before filtering, it works much better. Note that you don't want to get the oil too hot - perhaps nothing hotter than 100 degrees. I cracked the clear tube in my old two-battery one by running boiling water through it (requiring the purchase of this model).If you can find the older version, I highly recommend it, but the three battery version is definately a step backwards."
3,A sort of mystery,"I'm not sure how this book could have been helped. Though it's description hinted at mystical overtones none were found. It is a pleasant read but lacked punch. The odd restauranteur detracted from the story, the Psychic added little to the plot she was merely there, & though the main character took pictures it didn't really drive the plot. Great promise in the description but little pay off in the read."
5,A paranormal page-turner,"Portrait photographer Kate McGuire touched a headband and slammed into another place, a place where she was being choked to death. An experiment gone awry in a parapsychology class puts Kate in a killer's crosshairs. Kate hadn't paid much attention to her psychometry ability before, but she's suddenly thrust to center stage of a murder investigation. Reporter John Gerrard and the police become very interested in her visions as they provide leads to the missing coed's killer."
4,Story is catching,I read thru this one relatively quickly 'cos it is a good story. The plot is good and catches my attention.
4,Summer is coming,"This book is just in time for vacation. Good entertainment especially if you are a bit interested in those who have special senses. Kate, the main character, ""sees"" things happen to people she doesn't know. Mix up a bit of murder, mystery and romance and you have a good read!"
1,Listed Incorrectly,"The item is called ""9.6v"" but the Power supply I received states 11.2V DC on it! Of course the plug size is not compatible with my device. The seller refunded my money and explained it was listed incorrectly and they do not sell a 9.6V charger."
3,OK,It's a blue actinic light for a t5 fixture. What else can I say??? It didn't arrive broken so that's a plus.
4,Nice,"Nice little item. Purchasers might want to consider the battery powered starting stand, since it can take a while to get this up to speed otherwise. String starting method is okay, but after a couple uses the string broke."
4,Use wisely,"I liked it a lot.In the beggining, it took me some time to realize how to start and hold it, but afterwards i just kept using it over and over.I was once upset with the difficulty to start it and all the noises that it made, so decided to put in some wd-40 to soften its roll... bad idea, it went too loose. So i've openned it (it's easy to) and dryed it all. Now it works better, but doesn't get all the rpms it used to.And after using it so hardly i have hurt my wrist. Now can only use it with my left arm, until the right one gets healthy again.Well, i recommend its use, but wisely ;-)"
1,disappointed,I really really want to get this product to work but no matter what I do I can't seem to manage it. I even bought the docking station seperately to help get it started and just can't get it going. I wouldn't waste your money on this unless you already know someone who has one that seems to work. I'm wondering if mine's defective.
4,"Great Live Album, possible manufacture issues.","I picked this album up after a quick search at Best Buy. I was expecting it to be a little cheaper, 'Duality' was only 8 bucks when I got that, but anyways...If you're a fan or Ra, you know what to expect. A solid album, with a great mix of tracks from both 'From One' and 'Duality.' The album has a great sound considering it's a live album. Sahaj's vocals are excellent, much better quality then I have heard on bootleg live albums from them.I kicked a star off for the simple fact that the cd didn't play in the car when I bought it."
1,Betula Nubuck Sandal,"Very disappointed - have worn sandal perhaps 10 times and the main strap has torn from the sole - until repaired, the sandals are unwearable. These sandals were not worn in rough terrain, they were not buckled too tightly, they were not abused.I am unlikely to purchase any Betula product again."
2,Received Knock-Off Sandal,"I ordered this sandal because I thought I would be getting the Betula Licensed by Birkenstock Thong Sandal. Instead, I received a sandal that states it has the Birkenstock foot bed but I'm not sure it is since the sandal has the brand NEWALK on it. I've never even heard of this brand before. I am not happy with this sandal and I don't think this company should be able to advertise and picture one product but ship something completely different! BUYER BEWARE."
2,Cool but not so useable for hands-free phone action,"It was pretty cool to talk on the phone in sterio, however the person I was speaking to couldn't hear/understand me."
1,earbuds,earbuds are WAY TOO LARGE FOR MY EARS; (72 years old) and are not adjustable or interchangeable...
1,Truly terrible - I'd rather watch the movie MYSTERY MEN,"And this awful spin-off which Clancy has the audacity to put his name to makes the above movie worthy of Oscars. Don't get me wrong, Tom Clancy, when he actually writes his proper novels is capable of producing a real modern classic(RED STORM RISING). How he can be involved with such garbage such as these NET FORCE spin offs means one thing - alimony! Never mind. Kids buy this junk, Clancy makes money by using his name on the cover. At least POLITIKA had soem good ideas . . .If I was a publisher this would go in the slush pile/rejection bin. Childish, pedantic narrative, a daft plot right out of an episode of STAR TREK, too many references to TV, actors and so on to enhance a character study or action scene. Terrible. How does this get into print? T.C., how can you! I'm holding on for THE BEAR AND THE DRAGON."
2,A very uneasy to read book,After reading this book I didn't get even one thing out of it. there are much better books out there try the others.
4,Great Book - It Grows On You!,"I've almost always enjoyed Ms. Shinns books. The reason that I ordered this book is because I have the same name as the ""wizard-in-training"" who is the main character of the book. To be perfectly honest, I wasn't impressed with the book the first time that I read it. However, when I read it again at a later time (which I often do with my books) I dicovered the story was much better than what I originally thought - I actually liked the book. Later, after reading it a third time - I became kinda captivated with Ms. Shinn's story (go figure!) So, ultimately - I do recommend this book. However, if you don't get into the story during the first reading - give it another read at a later time - I feel you'll like this story better each time that you read it."
2,Just ok,"Compared to just about all of her other works, this book was rather disappointing. Rather a darker story than expected."
5,The Shape-Changer's Wife -- Short but Fantastic,"This is truthfully how fantasy writing was meant to be. ""The Shape-Changer's Wife"" is a beatiful, short tale with all the elements of the genre and wonderfully written. Most fantasy books try too hard to have complicated plots, and yet don't focus on the characters and the story itself. In this book, the tale is simple, but enriched and perfectly written.I would definetly recommend this to all Fantasy readers. Sharon Shinn is a master at storytelling."
3,"Not as good as the Archangel series, but a good read.","The Archangel Trilogy and more were such fun and interesting books to read, I really loved them. So, I thought I would try this one, it had good reviews. It was a good book. I just love the Archangel books more."
4,Simple and Lovely,"This was a very simple, lovely tale and a quick read as well. The author Sharon Shinn, has an elegant way with her prose, but I do have some complaints to make. First off, this is obviously a first work, the characters are not very well fleshed out and the love story makes no sense at first. Its just as if BOOM! the protagonist falls in love, with no real explanation as to how or why. Secondly, I could see the climax coming from a mile away, in fact I could see all the main reveals in the tale. Perhaps that is because I have read too much fantasy fiction over the years, my mind starts working like a fantasy fan.However, all that aside, I really did like this book, it was a quick read and did not bog me down in mundane, tiring details. I look forward to reading some of Shinns' other novels."
5,Lovely Story,"Sharon Shinn has written a lovely tale about love and magic. I really enjoyed this book, it is a wonderful fast read that stays with you long after you've read it."
4,nice item,"despite the bad reviews, this headset is a great one. i use it to play cs and it works just fine. sure it breaks easily but not unless you don't take good care of it. i take good care of my stuff and my headset has been with me for 6 months and it still works fine to this day. don't buy it if u are going to break it tho. its not for breaking :)"
3,"good mic and sound, not comfortable to wear for long time","Mic and sound is good for the price. Got them at local store for $14.99. However, the headset doesn't open wide enough for my big head. (never thought my head was big until wearing this headset) Appearantly, it's designed for narrow/small head person. Can't wear it prolong period of time. My ear hurts. Too bad....Have to return to the store."
4,Fairly Good,"The quality of the sound is fairly good for the price tag, and the microphone is quite responsive. However, the headphones become somewhat uncomfortable when worn for extended periods of time. All in all, a good buy."
1,Headset covers disintegrating,"Well, it looks like these aren't sold by anyone anymore, but I thought I'd write this for posterity. I had these in a drawer for a few years. I just pulled them out and used them for a half hour call. When I was done, my wife asked me what was on my face. The speaker covers are literally disintegrating into sticky black dust.Otherwise, they're great!"
2,does not work well for voice recognition.,This headset is not very comfortable it tends to fall off easily and if you need to use it for voice recognition it will not work very well. The stereo sound quality is good. The on off switch on the cord does not work all the time. If your looking for quality these are not the item!
3,"Nothing new at all, which is the only problem.","This is by far my LEAST favorite Montroll book. It is basically a collection of animals that he has either previously or since done much better! I own almost all of his books, and I would not recommend this one to any other person that has most of his books. However, the 3 star rating may be unfair, because I am comparing this book to the rest of Montrolls. I think, compared to most other origami animal books, this one would still rank near the top, but not after people discover Montroll's better books (North American Animals, African Animals, etc.)"
4,Great practice- not a good indicator of score.,"The CD is a must-have for any GMAT test-taker. If you can handle the practice tests on this CD you will sail through the GMAT. The scores, however, are way too low and can be discouraging. My personal experience on the Kaplan tests...690, 610, 640, 690. PowerPrep tests from ETS (available at ETS's web site) are a good indicator of score on actual GMAT tests. 760 and 770 on those. 770 on the real test. I know a ton of people who have taken Kaplan tests and the GMAT and the score differential is similar. So hang in there, and don't worry about your Kaplan score or timing."
5,Good start for GMAT studying...,"I took the GMAT three times and my score improved from 620 to 710. I believe that the GMAT is a matter of skill and practice. This is a good book to start studying. It covers the basic concepts and the explanations are clear.The CD Rom is quite good, but one of the practice tests is the same as the one offered through the website (for free...Good luck!"
4,Good... if used in tandem with other resources,"Its with great big smile on my face that I write this review. I studied for about a month and took the test yesterday with minimal expectations. I squeeked out a 640, which I consider pretty decent for the amount of work I put in. The books I used were the Kaplan text and the GMAC guide (print version). I also did some tests in the powerprep software. Kaplan is good, and its strategies on how the attack a problem are useful to use. Their grammer review ..., but the math review is pretty decent. The one piece of advice I can give is to take the Kaplan book for what it is: one opinion on how to do well. Absolutely check out the Powerprep software and I would review other study guides as well if you have time. I agree with the other reader reviews that mention the confusing and overly difficult questions on the Kaplan tests. I too noticed a significant increase in score when I jumped over to the powerprep software."
3,"Book is less than stellar, the CD is very good","The book is rather short and doesn't have too many questions. You could go through the entire book in under a day. The CD is however, worth the money with 4 full-length practice tests and numerous specific section tests."
3,worse hopper included but.....,the worst thing about this package is the hopper!!! broke right away! second the 9oz tank!!too small!! but you can buy those extras for under 25bucks!!other than that the marker is good!!!
2,Some useful information but...,"This book starts out very well, but after finishing the first half you realize one thing. This book could be half the size or less and still give you the same amou of information. The authors hash and re-hash the same point 5 times. While this can be very useful, when nothing is added the 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th times it begins to wear on the reader. I was actually able to guess what was coming up in some paragraphs and to me, this is a bad thing. Like I said, read the first half and don't bother with the rest."
4,Good way to keep highschool students engaged,The talk sheets are a good way to keep your students involved. You can have these sheets be a study in themselves or a way to add to something you are talking about. My only complaint is that the high school addition still seems like its for jr high students as far as questions go. Also look at the table of contents and see if you want to talk about those issues. I would look into getting the psalms and proverbs book. This book has some issues like war and suicide that I feel are not that relevant to my students.
2,Poor production and mixing,I've been waiting in anticipation for this album for ages. I have some of the songs on mp3 from the band's website and they have much much much more energy than this album. All you can here is drums vocals and rhythm guitars. The lead guitars and backing vocals are completely lost and it has ruined what promised to be a classic album. The band have been completely let down by the production and mixing!!!
4,Cool New Glam Metal,If you are a fan of 80s Glam Metal you should like this album. These young guys have picked up the torch nicely.
2,not worth it,sorry - I was dissappointed...weak material. one or 2 strong songs but sloppy playing and not inventive riffs detract.
3,"Not Gloria at her best, but intrigiuing charcter development","Though I love Naylor's writing style and her beautiful imagery, I ended this book feeling incompelte. All the characters were so well developed and engaging I wanted to know what become of them. Each character could have been its own book. I wanted to know more about the owner of the cafe and I defintely was fascinated with his love for his wife. However, their stories were not given much depth.My favorite, however, was definately the beautiful light skinned woman whose beauty became its own beast. I would love to see this developed into a short movie with Halle Berry or Thandie Newton as the lead. Unfortunately, it still seems to follow the tragic mulatto stereotype.I would still read this book if you are a Naylor fan because her writing is superior and her ability to create intriguing personalties never ceases to amaze me."
2,couldn't get into it,"I remember watching ""The Women of Brewster Place"" in high school, and being drawn into that world. That is what I expected from Gloria Naylor when reading ""Bailey's Cafe."" Bailey's Cafe is about a black couple, who owns a ""magical"" cafe. I was expecting to be swept away. Instead, I find myself bored to tears. Naylor spends pages upon pages describing such mundane details as war, the black experience, and baseball. Where she could use some help is in painting a picture. Each character is given the opportunity to explain who they are, but do we really care? I didn't, because the author spends pages upon pages describing details without taking the story anywhere. Take a risk. Although I didn't agree with everything in ""The Women of Brewster Place,"" that world stayed in my head long after I was finished. ""Bailey's Cafe"" is forgottable. I'm giving her two stars for effort, but I cannot recommend this boring, preachy novel."
2,Long and drawn out,"I have read both of the ""Brewster Place"" books and thought I may enjoy this one as well but some of the characters descriptions went on forever and toward the end I found myself skipping ahead just to get through the book. I am still a fan and look forward to reading some of her other books but this one didn't do it for me. I would not recommend it."
4,A Complex & Challenging Book,"This book's definitely not one that I'd put in the ""easy-to-read"" category. There were times when I was flat out lost as to what Gloria Naylor was trying to tell me when she was describing some of the things going on in some of the characters' lives. But, usually, by the end of the chapter, I figured out what it was that she was trying to tell me. If there were half-star ratings, I probably would have given this 3 and 1/2 stars instead of 4 but, since there isn't a half star to give, I went ahead and gave it 4 stars. This was a book that just kind of stayed ""gloomy"" and ""sad"" and it just never seemed to get out of that rut. I am not saying that every book has to be ""happy"", but, it would have been nice for ONE of the characters to have had a nicer story to tell. Nevertheless, fans of Gloria Naylor or people wanting to be mentally challenged ought to give this book a try."
2,Sexual details are very explicit and grotesque,"I found this novel to be extremely explicit in the description of the sexual experiences which each women partook in. Personally, I thought that ""Bailey's Cafe"" was going to be a good ol' down home kind of book, but I was greatly surprised. Literature nowadays is depressing, and often filthy."
3,I own it.,"You get what you pay for and while these tools are not real high quality they will do and are not what I would call ultra cheap quality either. The case they come in is fairly nice and does a very good job at keeping the tools organized.If you already know what you are doing then, for the money this is a good buy and you most likely will be pleased with the product. If you do not already know how to use the tools you will NOT be able to tell from what LOOKS like insturctions on the lid of the box. In this case you will either have a nice little tool kit that you can not use or you will possibly damage a nice watch braclet trying to figure it out. I was lucky and had a jewler friend the showed me how to use them.Overall I rated this product with 3 stars. If they had included some insturctions that would help the novice I would have rated it with 4 stars and due to price may would have even gone to 5."
4,"GET THE NEW ""2ND"" EDITION, NOT THIS ONE!","Dr. Howenstine a fine author and authority but this first edition should be removed because it's outdated. You'll find the newer edition here on Amazon, twice the length, updated and expanded. Don't buy this one by mistake."
4,Physician's Guide Review,"I found the book ""A Physician's Guide to Natural Health Products That Work"" to be benefiacal because Dr. Howenstine is a medical doctor, but he gives natural products to address a host of illnesses. And the information has been very helpful to me."
1,Not good,"I guess it was exactly what I ordered, but NOT what I thought I ordered. I mean, a movie has been made of this, ""Whiteout"". I didn't know I was ordering a 'comic-book'. I thought I was getting 'book'."
4,"Wonderful, but delicate!","I LOVED my Easyshare C633! The Auto focus was great and took better pics (on automatic focus mode) than friends' cameras which were more expensive. The only huge problem I had with it was that the LCD screen is so fragile. I returned my first (due to broken LCD screen) and had to trash the 2nd (for the same reason). Other than that, I'd say it's a great beginner camera, very user-friendly and easy to operate.It sucks up batteries, though seems to work best with AA Energizer lithium. Rechargeable Duracell batteries are always good to have, since you'll rotate through them a lot.By the way...I hope you never have to contact Kodak for help with any product, because the support people at Kodak are not very helpful and you have to jump through hoops to speak to an actual person on the phone."
3,Neutral,I purchased this item as a gift and have not had any complaints. I believe the recipient of this gift is satisfied and I know he has used it frequently.
1,Kodak Easy Share C633 6.1 MP Digital Camera,"This camera is not worth what it sells for. I got it for a Christmas gift with the docking station only 2 years ago, and it's shot. The first thing that I noticed with the camera is the shutter got stuck, 1/4 to 1/2 way open, not good. Had to pry it open manually. Next, the camera sucked batteries like there was no tomorrow, sort of like the big oil execs. sucked our money when gas was nearly $5.00 a gallon. The 3rd, and final thing that happened to the camera is the screen went out. How can you take pictures if you don't have any screen? Junk, Junk, Junk, probably made in China with lead too...."
2,I hate this camera,"This is the worst camera I ever used. I am so disappointed with it. The pictures are not that great. Never take a closeup with this camera, unless you like blurry pictures (even when you use the setting for close pictures) The lighting conditions have to be perfect to get a good picture off this camera - i.e. a bright sunny day.. otherwise expect to be disappointed. And indoor photos...forget it... and buy LOTS of batteries... this thing eats them like crazy!"
4,Calming long improvisations,"""Gnu High"" is made up of three songs, but you get the sense the song breaks are somewhat arbitrary. Kenny Wheeler has a top-notch group of Keith Jarrett (in his last sideman appearance), Dave Holland, and Jack DeJohnette. The 22-minute ""Heyoke"" starts with trumpet, then eventually Jarrett takes a long solo. Though you think the song is over before it really is, it all comes together very well. The playing is creative and calm. Since they don't go for the cheap thrill, it takes a listen or two to dig into this CD, but it's well worth the effort."
4,"It arrived after couple weeks, but i'm pleased with cd.","The actual cd was what I wanted, but I've received items much quicker from other vendors. It is somewhat of an obscure item. I would order a cd from them again."
2,Not what I'd hoped,"I used to own Gnu High when it was available on vinyl. Yeah, it was that long ago. I remembered it vaguely so after listening to the clips I purchased it. Not exactly a mistake, but not a treasure find either. Only the 2nd of 3 cuts is worth a listen. Cuts one and three are over-extended solos, with one having a really long bass solo. Not my cup of tea. When Keith Jarrett solos, it just doesn't really work, as happens for him. And after a while you'll realize a homogeneity between the thematic melodies, as nice as they are. Overall, its OK background music but you can't take it seriously despite the caliber of the musicians."
4,Sea Scary Monkeys,"Don't let the illustration on the box full you! These things are ugly, and they are quite hardy. I purchased sea monkeys to show my boyfriend what wonderfully weird toys us american children grew up with, and he now he is afraid of them. We are both afraid of them, actually. But we continue to feed them (mostly out of fear). They are fascinating to watch- kind of like some primordial creatures. And they will not die. It has been over a month and they are still alive."
3,Sea Monkeys Scared My Boyfriend,"I purchased the sea monkeys for my boyfriend as a surprise because I remembered when my older sister & brother had sea monkeys when we were kids, and felt nostalgic. He is not american and has never heard of sea monkeys, so I wanted to show him what they looked like. When they first hatched, they were tiny, cute little specs. Now they are these ugly, prehistoric-looking creatures that continually gross out both me and my boyfriend. They are fascinating, though, and have lived longer than any goldfish I ever bought from a pet store. As a matter of fact, both he & I wish that they would die of natural causes since we cannot bring ourselves to starve or kill them."
1,Eggs don't hatch,I bought two of these for Christmas and the eggs from neither pack hached. I think this is a rip-off. BEWARE!!!
3,I flushed them!,"They basically do nothing fun. They are like fish, but really small. My friends thought they were ugly, my nephews could not get the spirit, for the Sea Monkeys seems to be invisible to young kids (ages 4 and 3 at that time). Anyways, I still have one set of them and two bowls. I hope I find it more fun next time. By the way, I am 29 years old, and first had my Sea Monkeys two years ago."
1,BEWARE! BEWARE! BEWARE!,"I just received this as a birthday gift- so excited to watch them grow, I filled it with water & placed it upon my computer monitor at work. Being a web designer for a major advertising agency, I had big plans of making a very cool sea-monkey growth charting web site so that i could share my fun with the world. Well, within 10 minutes of filling the container with water, my computer screen began to shake & the smell of smoke was apparent. Now I have to deal with explaining why my monitor is ruined & possibly pay to replace it. This adorable little toy has ruined my day!"
1,A great teaching aid that shows the cruel mortality of death,"The Sea Monkey(r) Magic Castle by Exploratoy is a wonderful illustration to younger audiences of the harsh, disastrous, and benign existence of all life.To watch your sea-monkeys(r) hatch right before your eyes is an amazing sight, but only for a fleeting moment as we come to realize the shadow of death hang's over them, as it does for all people, plants, solar system, etc.To feed your sea-monkeys and watch them hatch young is a great oppourtunity to teach your child about the grim spectacle of trying to continue ones genetic material, but that doesn't matter anyways because we are all going to die.Small, compact system with good quality plastic containers, and includes all you need to realise ones own mortality. 6 and up."
2,"love sea monkeys, but our packets were defective...","I'm not here to say this is a bad product. However, we bought BOTH the magic castle and the life on mars sets and BOTH came with egg packets that appeared to have gotten wet, or something. THey were supposed to be a powder that you pour into the pre-treated water, but when we opened the egg packets, they were sticky and clumpy. Needless to say, no sea monkeys were born, despite our following directions perfectly. There's no recourse and now I find myself having to order more packets, which makes my products MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE than they should be. Thought you should know."
5,Sea-Monkey's are Great!,WE are in our 3rd week with the sea monkeys and there are a bunch of large ones swimming around. The castle kit is great and comes with the plazma....which seems to work better than the kit that does not. Those died within a week.
4,R. Berthoud,"A true story about a Italian NYC police officer battleing organized crimein early 1900 new York city. Low budjet but stillgood. The sceen where a youngster is hurt simply becauseher father hasen't paid his protection money is ruff to see, even for today's standards.The third party responsable for delivery had problems. Beside that all was well."
5,PAY OR DIE-REVISITED,"""PAY OR DIE"" IS ABOUT THE REAL LIFE SAGA OF NYC POLICE LIEUTENANT JOSEPH PETROSINO. HIS EARLY ATTEMPTS TO BRING DOWN THE MAFIA BAND KNOWN AS THE BLACK HAND COST HIM HIS LIFE AFTER HE FOUND OUT THE NEW YORK HEAD OF THE GROUP,AND TO HIS DEMISE, THE CAPO MAFIA HEAD. ERNEST BORGNINE PORTRAYS PETROSINO AS A TOUGH AND GENTLE LAWMAN OUT TO PROTECT THE INNOCENT CITIZENS OF LOWER NYC DURING THE EARLY 1900'S. ""PAY OR DIE"" IS A REALISTIC FILM ABOUT THE EARLY DAYS OF THE MAFIA HOLD KNOWN AS THE BLACK HAND."
5,"A great movie,definitely worth buying","This is a very good movie and definitely worth the money.This movie was on my most wanted list for 20 years or so.When the movie became available, I bought it.Ernie as usual does a fine acting job. The movie is based on actual occurences,perpetrated by the Black Hand.In my opinion this movie deserves a 5 star rating.,definitely worth buying......Shelby"
4,MORE THAN I EXPECTED!,"This book is fabulous! Although some of the crafts are a little tricky, it is very fun! There are so many possibilities! It gives you something to do with all those knick knacks!! HIGHLY recomended."
1,Only 2 good projects in the whole darn book!,"I thought that this book would have some good ideas to turn my room into a '60s themed room but all the ideas in this book are [junk]. The only good ideas are the pattern for the Holly Golightly's Dream Bag since it is very simple (wouldn't use the woven ribbon idea though) and the Mystery Date End Table (I would use the old-school Candy Land or other fun game from my childhood to bring back memories). If you have a lot of old stuff that you want to make look like ""new"", then this is a good book. If you are looking to create a '60s themed room, don't get this book."
5,"Fun Projects, Great Ideas","I love this book. It is a great source of ideas and inspiration for creating with ""found objects."" For years I've collected weird little things: fortune cards from coin ""fortune tellers,"" casino dice, beads, etc, etc. This book shows you how to create knick knacks, furniture, purses, jewelry, and more by integrating these ""collections"" into creative projects. Very funky and very fun."
5,The best book out there!,This book it great! It has unique and fun craft projects for those of us who don't like the run-of-the-mill cute snowman dolls that are frequent in todays craft world. I've done many of the projects and they have been fun to do and even better to look at afterwards. This book is a must-have for anyone interested in folk art crafts!
5,Symbolism,"It didn't take much for me to realize the dangers of masonic symbolism. One hour in a book store with an occult book showed me all I needed to know to stay away from freemasonry. I was enticed by how much good they do for children, too bad the healthcare system can't do it. However, they don't do much for salvation, actually they do a great deal for damnation. Sorcery at it's most subtle. And to think it all started with research into the masonic symbolism within the Great Seal of The United States. Magick is magick and it's opposite Christ. Pray, in Jesus' name, that more people's eyes will be opened through the Holy Spirit, and that He will fill our country's leadership."
2,"This CD is 100% free from mistakes, but quickly becomes forgettable.","This CD is subtle and accomplished, but it's overcautious and there's too much guardedness & fear of getting out of line. It's like they're playing defensively in front of a hanging judge."
3,almost great,My purchase was not as great as I thought jt would be. The tower will not rotate without sticking. I can live withit.
1,"ricketty plastic, CHEAP","Oh lord, I just got this damn cd spinner today, thinking i'd gotten something nice to display my cd cases in. But I WAS WRONG. It's cheap plastic and really hard to put the cds in. You have to pry them in...and for almost 15 buckss?? For those thinking it's the only cd collection holder that has more than 30 cds, GO TO A STORE. I've searched amazon for so long, but this was the only one that seemed to work for me, BUT IT ISN'T GOOD. For this amount of money, just go to a store. You'd find something MUCH better than this ricketty piece of junk."
2,Hard to use,"I bought this for my 8 year old daughter's CD collection, but it is very difficult to slide the CDs in straight. It's fine storage if you don't plan on removing the CDs very often, but in our house this ended up being unused and finally donated."
4,A great forgotten movie,"Worth finding and checking out.Powell is excellents, as is MenjouWatch out for aquick appearance by a young Barbara Billingsley"
2,They've shortened the story!,"Like you may assume, this is a retelling of the classic fairy tale in English and Spanish. The translations are pretty accurate, so if that's your concern, you can go ahead and get this book.What I didn't like was that the story was much more condensed from how I remembered it. I realize that everyone's entitled to tweak the story a little bit, but a lot of critical parts in the story are missing. While Jack does get some magical beans and climbs the stalk, not much activity occurs between the time he spots the giant and escapes with the money. It doesn't seem like an adequate story since the adventure at the top of the beanstalk has been reduced to a mere couple of sentences. It's true that very young children might not notice that a big detail in the story is gone, but I'm sure there are better versions of the story out there. Unfortunately most of those other versions aren't presented in both English and Spanish."
4,Short and Sweet,"A condensed Jack and Beanstalk story in English and Spanish. Great for a quick bedtime story for little ones, for young readers who speak both languages, or are learning one or the other. But the best memory I have of this book is that it introduced me to Arnal Ballester, the illustrator. Here he's limited to a few characters (still great), but seek him out and you'll find a body of work that will leave your mind glowing."
1,Better than Ambien,"This movie is unbelievably soporific. Apart from the Paris scenery - it lacks any merit - I'm sure that the piece from which Proust is touted to have inspired this boring, self indulgent piece of cinema had redeeming context. This has none. What a waste!"
4,Jarrett Superb in Rough Territory,"I don't know exactly how many pianists there are in the world - probably several million? Of these, only a tiny number could have pulled this recording off, and none better than Keith Jarrett, one of the finest pianists we have working in any genre or idiom. This isn't jazz at all, but rather piano transcriptions of one man's memories of central Asian Christian music. The transcriptions are not artful, but this doesn't stop them from shining like uncut gems. If you can connect with these minor melodies, then you'll find this recording exceptionally beautiful, as I do."
3,I like to read Gurdjieff but...,Not that I'm trying to ruin the great idea of SACRED HYMNS. I just think Gurdjieff is as good in composing music as Freud or Nietzsche... Jarrett's playing is impeccable as always but music is rather boring. My modest opinion-3 stars
2,Jarrett - Sacred Hymns,"Checked this one out a bunch of times and in different moods. Really wanted to give it a chance after hearing some good things about it, but found it to be extremly dull and uninteresting each time. Oh well. Am still a Jarrett fan."
4,Correction,"I just want to correct the previous reviewer. The language of most of these hymns is actually Syriac/Western Aramaic which is our true liturgical language. Arabic is used in some of the hymns and in our liturgy since most Maronites today speak Arabic as their first language, but it is certainly not our ""liturgical language."""
3,Worth a listen,"I picked this CD up randomly in a store one day five or so years ago, and I still listen to it. It is three ladies singing traditional music from various regions around Bulgaria. They manage some pretty amazing harmonies, and are at their strongest on the tracks like ""oh Matse"" and ""White Rada"" where they sing without instrumentation. The songs with instruments are still good, but the instruments can overwhelm the vocals at times. The only part I didn't like was track 6 (""Fog Has Fallen"") where they brought in a piano, which didn't quite fit in with the rest of the music (different scale?). The liner notes are almost unintelligible (looks like a bad translation), but other than that I like the CD. It's worth a listen."
3,"The good, the bad and the ugly","I love Law and Order CI and the regular series. This is a disappointment. It is half Chris Noth/Nicholson and half Vincent D'Onofrio/Erbe. Sadly, the demise of Vincent is clear in the first episodes and it does not get better. The episodes with his mother are almost pathetic. Horrible acting. Only the Noth/Nicholson episodes are great, as usual. Eric Bogosian is fantastic; a breath of much-needed fresh air revitalizing the squad room."
5,Great Cast!,Loved the show and the interaction between all of the characters. Couldn't ask for a better show. Kept me on my toes!
1,Aspect ratio messed up for this episode.,"The plot is intriguing, but the aspect ratio is messed up on this episode making it very distracting to watch."
3,Ho hummmmm,"Out of print Caroll & Graf Victian Erotica ... atributed to Anonymous ... but it should have James Jennings moniker ...OK there are 3 stories in this book the main entry being 'The Devils Advocate' at 237 pages. I have read this book in another volume and it's OK but notng to write home to mother about... deals with a young Rita hiring the perverse detective Jack Barnett to find her sister that had been kidnapped by a sex cult.The 'Power of Mesmerism' is a 5 star story that is also available in many other volumes. This book deals with the Ethridge kids and their parents as they youngsters have learned how to hypnotize everyone around them .... and... well you can guess the rest ... its a fabulously erotic story ..Finally we have 'Flossie' which, should not be confused with the popural and well known book 'Flossie: A Venus at Age Eighteen' ...... this Flossie has all the skills of the classice but none and I mean none of the 'finesse' ....."
5,columbo the great,"I have loved this series of the bumblng but brilliant trip you up detective, it brings back fond memories and brings about a lot of talk for all who also have great memories of this classic and unforgetable show."
4,No frills; just good preservation of these shows,"I'm not awfully hard to please. There isn't a lot of extra special add-on type features with this DVD set. If you just want no-frills digital copies of these good shows, this is for you.The scene selection is rather limited. In other words, in a full-length show, you might have only five or six scenes to select if you want to use scene selection. But that's not a big deal.Peter Falk is one of a kind. I was a small kid when these came out. I didn't appreciate the talent of Peter Falk then. Watch him carefully in these shows, and you might find him understatedly hysterical. I don't know how they shot some of that stuff with straight faces. Falk is a gem. Get these, and you'll see what I mean!"
5,columbo great as always,I have the whole Columbo series. They are just as I remember them 38 yrs ago!
4,Great show,"Unlike some others, Season 4 isn't my favorite, but it's still first run Columbo, so that while not the best of Columbo, it's still good, worth watching and worth buying.An Exercise in Fatality - As someone who grew up on Baa Baa Black Sheep and the Wild West, seeing Robert Conrad as such an unlikable murderer is fantastic. Suspect he really enjoyed the role.Negative Reaction - Dick Van Dyke as a killer is also interesting. One of my problems is I don't think that I've ever seen a killer with such a blank look before when he commits the crime.By Dawn's Early Light - good, but just not my favorite McGoohan episode. Columbo staying in the barracks is worth the price of admission.Troubled Waters is fun. Columbo, while seasick, just takes the killer apart.I always find Playback to be forgettable. Just don't care for the killer."
3,columbo slipping,"although i'm a huge fan of columbo i found that 6 episode is nowhere near enough to be considered a season or a box set. the episodes in this season are an exercise in fatality, negative reaction (one of my personal favourite episodes with dick van dyke), by dawns early light, troubled waters, playback, and a deadly state of mine. this set like season 3 also has an episodde of mrs columbo a riddle for puppets."
5,COLUMBO SHOULD GET 10 STARS!!!,"This is my favorite show of all time! Almost every episode is like watching a high quality movie. What's great about the Columbo plot is that you KNOW THE KILLER FROM THE START. We all have murder in our heart, to some degree. When we watch the killer plan and execute the crime, we vicariously become the killer. The 4th season is great. Yes, BY DAWNS EARLY LIGHT is the best, great ending. Hint, The title is a clue! Also, I checked the clock in NEGATIVE REACTION. There are no hours on the face. I thought they might have slipped up. I am a Columbo style writer. If you are interested: POKE60099@YAHOO.COM."
3,Ok,I bought this for my husband for Christmas who is an ultimate fan of Columbo and I was very dissappointed that this particular season contained episodes that he didn't like much. I would say to make sure you or the person you are gifting to like the shows contained in this collection. I had to send it back.
4,Colombo fans will love this collection!!,"The episodes all look and sound very good. The only thing that I don't like about these seasons is that they show short clips of the episode as a preview before the actual episode. You cannot just skip past these episode previews, you have to fast forward, or you will miss the beginning of the actual episode. They should have put a chapter marker before the actual episode begins. Other than that, a great collection for Colombo fans!"
1,"Excellent Shows, But 1st DVD Was BLANK!","Let me just say that I have 5 seasons of Columbo. The show is excellent and the only flaws are in the packaging by Universal Studios Home Entertainment. Season 3 had many points where the show locked up. But they outdid themselves in Season 4 by sending a blank disk, so I only have 4 episodes, not 6.This in no way reflects negatively on Amazon, rather it is the fault of poor dvd production and quality control by Universal.So if you order this excellent series, check out your disks right away."
5,Columbo Fourth Season,Just like the past three seasons. The season of Columbo is great. I love them all not a bad movie in them. Came in good time.
1,Not good at all....,"I recieved this charger and it did not work. I called and asked if I can have another one sent to me. Yes, they sent it to me, but this one also did not work. I just gave up after that. Very bad products. Would never order from here again."
3,The taller the better,This item is a good product fits tall dogs very well but doesn't fit short dogs very well. The sleeves get caught and tangle the dogs up on the shorter dogs.
5,Looking East,"I first heard Dusan Bogdanovic on the radio program, Hearts of Space. Specifically, show #280, ""Looking East"", which featured ""Winter Tale"" from this CD. It was a long, long, time ago, and around 1999 I gave up looking for all the artists featured on that program. Shame on me for waiting so long to seek it on Amazon! Of COURSE it's here! and the rest of the tracks on this CD are just as mysterious and dreamy as the one I'd fallen in love with.""Levantine"" (I'd heard it many times, but had to look up the meaning) refers to the part of the Middle East furthest from the west, including such varied cultures asTurkish, Israeli, and Syrian. This music will take you there as if you are floating on a magic carpet, beholding the mountains, the white minerets, the ancient walls of forgotten cities. It is great ambient music, but will also catch your ear with interesting melodies and rythms."
2,Early Views on Kent State Shootings,"How Murder Went Unpushished by Stone, is just that... an early paperback that attempts to draw attention to the unjust nature of the shootings. As an historical review relatively shortly after the event, it contains a very accessable reprinting of the FBI investigation. This book is recommended if only for that reason... but, given so many other books that also look at the trials, settlements, and new information that has surfaced since the time of publication, this book will appear dated by comparison. --A must have for Kent State Riot completists, but should be viewed as an EARLY historical reference."
1,HAIER Raising experience,"JUNK! JUNK! JUNK!Noisy machine runs all day.Within 30 days the cold water section stopped working (though it still produces somewhat hot water, which is quite useless for lemonade)I have seen other reviewers claim that you should not leave it running all the time - who will do that???? Isnt a water dispenser supposed to be plugged in and ready?AVOID THIS MANUFACTURER, the tv I got also sucks"
1,Disappointed,"The other bad reviews are correct. Mine did taste like chemicals for the first 4-5 gallons of water. After that it was regular tasting.The water isn't very cold and the water output is small stream, about 1/8 inch. Takes forever to fill a cup.It does run all day and isn't very efficient. The water should be colder for the amount of time spent cooling.I just went on vacation for one week, so I unplugged the unit to save energy. I returned, plugged it in and all it did was get REALLY hot, the unit, and the water was hot coming from the cool spigit.I have only had the unit less than 4 months. I looked at the warranty and the nearest repair shop is 4 hours away in my case. It isn't worth the time, effort and money to get it fixed since I paid 50 bucks for the unit.What a piece of crap."
1,Junk!,"Haier WDQT165W Desktop Water DispenserThis item is a problem in many ways.1st of all when I received the machine, the well was already wet, which tells me that this item was used and it was sold to me.2nd, the taste of the water that passes through this water cooler tastes like chemicals, I a water cooler that my provider lent me and the water tasted perfect, but with this machine I purchased from amazon it tastes like chemicals.3rd of all the machine does not really make the water cold, and the machine runs all day long (not very effective in connserving energy) I believe that I received an already defective item and it was resold to me.I WOULD STEAR CLEAR OF THIS PRODUCT!"
5,A tour de force,I will never think of a glass of water in the same way again. This book caused me to truly rethink my place in the cosmos.
2,Sluggish,"I am a popular science junkie, but this book really put me to sleep. The material is covered well in a number of other books; the novelty, I presume, is the use of an oxygen atom to tell the story. But this has also been done before and, to tell you the truth, I found this approach soporific. It did not add to the book, either as a pedagogical tool or as a dramatic device. I did learn a few things, and for that I must give Prof. Krauss his due. But this is not the way to convey the wonder and excitement of science to the general reader."
2,Boring and wordy...,"If you like science fiction you may enjoy this book. But if you are looking for a good nonfiction book about science/physics, I recommend you look elsewhere. This book is too wordy and too long for what it is attempting to explain. Krauss' other works are much better."
4,Great Projector,"This projector is the perfect tool for my teaching presentations. The colors are bright, it has a great resolution image and the menu is easy to handle and understand. Although it is very light I wish it were a little bit smaller."
5,Best Projector,This is the best projector I have bought and used. The price was excellant for the superior quality and ease of use. I highly recommend it.
4,Very academic,"Wonderful pictures that help you identify the weeds, but the descriptions are not for the amateur gardener. i enjoy leafing through the pages, wish the descriptions were more accessible for the non-scientific mind."
5,Weeds of the Northeast,"I help identify weeds in Texas and this is one of my most used books to check an ID after Keying out a plant or for taking a quick look through a recognized family. Very few books concentrate on weeds so this type of book is much needed. Excellent photography and good information. This is so well done, I wish the authors would do it again with 175 different weeds. Thanks for a truely great book."
5,Really needed,A very useful book for those of us in the northeast seeking to identify weeds and wildflowers. Certainly a one-of-a-kind publication.
3,weeds over my head,"Personally I found this book on weed Identification more technical then helpful, I would have found it more helpful if there was less technical language and more photos showing the weeds in mature stages with simpler language describing the species. also it would have been nice to see suggestions on how to control these species on those pages. Pictures in many cases were to small to show a good example of the weed species for proper identification. I would not recommend this book for novices."
5,Everything You Ever Wanted to Know About Weeds.....,"This is the BEST book on the subject......and coming from the experts at Cornell, it is to be expected. Fine photography, making identification a breeze. A great addition to the home library!"
4,fantastic beginner book,"This is a fantastic book for the beginner botanist and gardener. Though it doesn't mention every weedy plant you may run into (and if it did, the book would likely be two inches thick), it does include most weeds that you will run into. What I really love about this book is that for each species mentioned, there are usually two or three accompanying photos, making a quick ID unusually easy. Like most identification guides, this book works best when accompanied by a more comprehensive guide for those species that a quick reference guide can't provide."
5,Excellent Resource,"I have numerous books for identifying local flora (specific to trees, wildflowers, prairie plants, tall grasses, etc.) but had been looking for one which identifies the weeds. This is it! The photographs are extremely helpful -- most of which include a photo of the mature plant as well as the seedling -- and the line drawings are equally informative. Although I live in Central Illinois, this book is an excellent reference for my local weeds. FYI: I also have the book, Common Weeds of Kansas, which is also very good -- but not as useful as this one for weed identification."
3,Acrobatic ambiance,"3 1/2Though too flimsy to register masterwork status, these four consuming tracks of lingering jazz atmospherics achieves a cumulative transportive effect."
4,Watched it twice in one weekend,"I thought this movie was going to border on pornography at first, but I was surprised to find how sweet, clever and interesting it was. This is not your average chick-flick love story. I watched it alone the first time and loved it so much I had to watch it again with my husband who also enjoyed it. It's got some hilarious one-liners and some very poignant moments as well. The acting isn't bad either."
3,Just Okay,"I rented this based on the high reviews I read. Was it all that? I didn't think so, but it wasn't terrible either. It had some deeper undertones that I could appreciate and some that were just too out there, and on the surface it was dry. The storyline, albeit weak, could've shined a lot more with a different ending. At first I thought they were going to do it right, to include the one guy staying in LA, and getting his own place...then wha bammm, sure enough I was left with a blase ending. Too buy? Definitely not! Too rent? Well, only if there are a bunch of 1 to 2 star movies playing."
1,Unrealistic and objectifying to male and female and give hope to the hopeless men,"This can be a 5 stars for some hopeless guys want to watch this movie to be more hopeful for their fantasies. Two unemployed construction workers were hired to have sex with two rich beautiful and great women and living in their luxury villa and the women feed them with their cookings. A girl objective is to make her man happy in bed. Another girl wants sex a lot and inspires her ""man"" to be a writer. Suddenly, one of the men is called be a model the next morning in Milan and the other ex-construction worker knows how to write and finish a book/story with a computer.It is a unrealistic movie and the plot is kinda cliche and fantasy to please male audiences. It is condescending to male and female alike such as treating relationships as pure objects and skipping out many details and struggles about how two types of people from different worlds can come together at the first place."
4,"funny, good writing","the plot sounds kind of ridiiculous when you read it but once you get into it, its pretty funny and sort of believable. this is a cleverly written script and a cute cast. the blond guy in it is really hot. it was entertaining and kept you guessing. me and my husband enjoyed it."
4,Surprisingly good.,"As suggested above, unexpected good film. Superb character development, story line flows well, good use of relationship theme for a touching film. Good actors !"
4,Great overall CD,"This is a great album overall. There are a few tracks I don't care for as much, which I can't remember off the top of my head. I think track 5 is one of them. But it's just a personal preference. Others here may really enjoy them. If you like this piano-driven style, I would recommend checking out Josh Kramer (especially ""Only Memories"" and ""Lonely Waltz for Two"") or Max Richter (""When She Went Away"", and ""On the Nature of Daylight""). Also, Olafur Arnalds is another recent gem that most haven't heard of yet."
1,Very little of substance,"Promises a LOT more than it delivers; very basic information, padded with lots of ""chatty"" verbiage. It's particularly annoying that the author spills lots of ink telling you how he won't waste your time. Contains a few useful hints, which could have made a reasonable newspaper article, but not much more."
3,"more of a guide on how to sell on ebay, no great insight on how to make a business out of it","If you're looking for a guide that explains the basics of selling items around the house on ebay, this will do fine for you. However, if you're interested in starting a profitable ebay business, you won't find any great information in this guide. The market price for many items on ebay is extremely low, so in order to turn any sort of a profit you'd need a way to purchase items far below retail, and even below some wholesale prices. In order to make much money on ebay, you'll need to find some pretty good supplier connections - and this book gives you no insightful information on how to do so. The title of the book would be more appropriate if they left off the ""and make a fortune"" part."
5,"If you are interested in e-bay, this book mis a must have!",I read this book cover to cover in 3 days. I picked it up and could not put it down.It takes you through the ins and outs of a very complex website.We are going to start selling Jewelry and Gems on the web site. When we tried yo make our way through the site by ourselves before we read the book we were lost and did not know what to do to present our goods in the best way possible to increase our chances of selling them for a fair price.The book will take you through the sign up process to how many pixels you need for the best pictures for the site. I highly recommend it. You will not regret buyig this book if you are serious about multiple items on e-bay.We also bought The Dummies Book for E-bay. While I read one book my husband read the other. After we finished the book we were reading we switched and read each others book. By doing this the two books support each other and we feel very well prepared to start showing our items on e-bay.
2,If You Know Your Way Around a Computer...,"This is not the book for you...or at least, that is how i felt.I agree with the rating that said it was very drawn out...because it is. All i kept thinking was YAWN...when are we gonna get to the good stuff.When I did arrive at the ""good stuff""...for example how to title your listings, it was short, to the point and nothing enlightened me to something new.Regret the purchase and hope that in the future the publisher will add that this is a very basic book for the beginner."
5,Nice. Very Nice.,I wasn't expecting much. Sorry Elenco but I never really considered Elenco to be top of the line stuff. This breadboard exceeded my expectations. The boards are mounted well and the holes seem like they will stand up well to constant use.When putting on the banana jacks notice they are keyed both top and bottom. Line upt the flat ends in the hold when you tighten and they will stay in place.I'll buy again and won't turn my nose up at Elenco products without trying them.
4,Nice kit,"It's a nice kit, and it's a good price, but the banana plug terminals at the top are pretty cheesy, and easily fall apart. The different lengths of wire are nice, but not every possible connection length is covered, requiring some creativity to get everything connected."
5,Breadboard Set quite useful,I bought this breadboard for my intro to electrical engineering. Its a great set since it comes with a kit of jumper wires. This case alone is 10 dollars. So it is totally worth your money.
5,Breadboard review,"I was looking for an affordable but decent quality breadboard for doing experiments with. There is a wide range of quality and pricing, so it took some time finding what I was looking for. Anyway, I am very pleased in what I got. It is well put together in that it is built to last and not just thrown together with cheap quality materials to get a sale. This breadboard will probably outlast me. Thanks!"
4,Spy Kids: All The Time in The World,"My grandchildren enjoyed watching this. They have other movies and also DSI games, therefore, haven't watched this much after viewing it once of twice."
3,It was Okay. The first two were the best.,"The first two were the best, Three was okay, this one wasn't the same without mom & dad. Seeing the original two children as grown ups was okay, and Jessica Alba is better looking in Fantastic Four 1 and 2."
5,My daughters loved it!,After watching the movie (my daughters have watched all from this sequel) they told me that this one was the best of all. Now they are convinced that they want to be spies :/
1,Awful,"This movie has a woman 9 months pregnant, who's still fighting like a ninja and as agile as a gymnast. Her husband is clueless and useless.This is pure anti-male social engineering."
1,Spy Kids 4: All The Time In The World,"As with plenty of franchises before it, the Spy Kids movies may be running low on creative juice, but that doesn't mean they know when to pack it in. Spy Kids: All the Time in the World in 4D, the latest entry in Robert Rodriguez's venerable kiddie adventure series, wasn't exactly greeted fondly by me, mainly because I haven't enjoyed a Spy Kids movie since Spy Kids 2: The Island of Lost Dreams. Jessica Alba stars as a retired spy who's lured back into action when a maniacal supervillain threatens the free world. She's joined in her mission by some newly recruited spy kids. The movie will probably appeal to the little ones, and there are moments of visual inventiveness, but for the most part adults may be less than charmed this time out. For all you Spy-hards out there, the new Blu-ray has plenty of cool extras, including an interview with Rodriguez by an intrepid kid reporter, behind-the-scenes footage, and deleted scenes."
3,On the fence,"I am on the fence about this since I did grow up with the original Spy Kids. Robert Rodreguiez does great action movies & his first, second, and third children's action flick was better. This needed a lot of improvement compared to those movies, & in his old age Robert seems like a dumb pervert and that puts me off when it comes to any of his directing abilities new & old."
2,mediocre kids show,It's another sequel that didn't get any better by adding new characters. It lacked the cool gadgets that the other Spy Kid films had. The pace went too fast and didn't allow you to get to like any of the characters.I missed the original characters/actors who were much better; if you're going to do a series of film the same actors should be used. Disturbs the continuity. Another example of a waste of money and time.
4,Spy Kids ~ great for kids,"If your kids are into super heroes and love to be sneaky, this is one of the movies they will love. My daughter is into all the Spy Kids movies and loves to watch story unfold. Although not as good as the 1st (are they ever really?) It was fun to watch my daughters reaction to some of the stunts and equipment the kids used in the movie."
2,Disappointing,"Disappointing. Rodriguez can make really good movies but this one is pretty routine pandering to an undemanding child audience. A good movie for kids doesn't pander and thus succeeds better at entertaining kids and adults. The cast is wasted on this movie.Jessica Alba in her black spy outfit looks great, though, and I kind of wish she had been cast as either Natasha Romanov or Selina Kyle in the Avengers or Batman movies respectively. She doesn't embarrass herself in this sub-par film and I've been impressed with her growth as an actress the last few years. I think she could have pulled off either role and looked amazing doing it."
2,Disappointing for me and my kids,"Not even Jessica Alba could save this outing from being a boring and very sub-standard offering from Robert Rodriguez, who also made the previous 3 Spy Kids movies. This 4th movie in the Spy Kids series pales by comparison and left my younger kids - who enjoyed the previous three movies - disappointed. Perhaps its because Rodriguez has previously covered all he can in this franchise and there is nothing new or novel to be offered here. Time to call it a day with this franchise Robbie, and move on to newer pastures."
2,disappointed,"This movie I expected to be a lot better. I watched the trailer and I was like, This looks great! I thought it would be more funny, more exciting, more realistic, and a whole lot more entertaining. I sort of liked this movie, but it just really disappointed me. I think that people who think that this movie will be really good because they watched the trailer should be warned: this movie is not at all what it looks like in the trailer."
1,purile nonsense.,"i watched about ten minutes of this laboured unfunny movie and just couldnt stand it,the kids were awful,josh whatever was even more irritating than on tv,and the 3d effect was minimal.. the only saving grace was jessica alba,but why did she do it?the humor was weak and unoriginal and was clearly designed for non judgmental kids.If you are over 10 stay well clear of this bomb..ps the aroma scope feature clearly indicates the level at which this film is targeted....the whole film stinks!!!"
4,Different !,"A great recording of the ""Master of Truth"".And indeed, it is a different recording!Not like the typical Bohemian style.It is an outstanding performance, almost chamber likeand very symphonic.A different approach to the Dances, without the usualbeauty: more serious.For me this is The Number One recording of the Dances(and I know at least ten of them !)."
5,Great Stuff,"This disc is a joy. First of all, the Chamber Orchestra of Europe play magnificently, capturing the elative spirit of the music wonderfully. While the interpretation isn't completely conventional, Harnoncourt displays almost none of his normal eccentricities here, just letting the listener get caught up in the joy of the music. The recorded sound is wonderful, and the Teldec presentation is, as always, extremely elegant. Don't hesitate to buy this disc."
5,This is Fabulous,"I have 4 or 5 of the Intelligent Plant Lights, and one at work so I can grow my Orchids and African Violets. You set it for the season of the year and stick the water sensor in the plant and it has a flashing light when you need to water. My plants are beautiful because of this product. I did have to replace the grow light bulb recently but it lasted 3-4 years and I ordered it through Amazon too. If you want beautiful plants, order this light."
5,It really works well!,"When I got moved from an office with windows to one without, I was a little sad when I had to give up my plants. But with this, my plants are thriving! I even brought in one of my very picky Nepenthes pitcher plants and it seems be be doing better then when I had it in my greenhouse at home!I love this light, and I am planning on buying a few more."
1,I hated it,"I bought this plant light and I got very disappointed. If I had not thrown away the packaging, I would have returned it. This is NOT suitable for indoor plants because the lamp is like any other ordinary fluorescent lamp. Fluorescent lamps are not good for plants. In order to have best results from indoor plants, using artificial light, it must be a gro-lux wide spectrum fluorescent type of lamp. Gro-lux lamps have the wide spectrum of lights that looks very close to the sun ray lights. Fluorescent lamps DO NOT have this!"
5,Every church library needs this.,"A recent survey found that the death of a pet is one of the times when children most want to talk to clergy---rivalled only by divorce. This book asks some difficult questions (what is the church? how do we deal with death?) and offers, in return, God's love. Churches which celebrate the Feast of St. Francis could have someone read it out loud after the service and lead a discussion. This lovely story will appeal to all ages."
5,A great book for animal lovers,"This book is wonderful for anyone who's ever had and loved a cat. It does deal with death, and is very sad at the end. A great way to help a child deal with the death of a pet."
3,Impossible,"After watching the Nickelodeon cartoon i was intersted in the games. After beating the original, I started Tak 2. It was fun, and challenging. THeo nly problem is, theres no instruction on how to close these ""rifts"" that Tlaloc caused. Ive thrown magic at them and destroyed all the monsters spit out from them. Everything. So it was fun untill you have to beat the game."
2,I HATE it!,"Just to let you know, I am not a kid under the age of 13. [...]This game is totally not enjoyable. I mean who would enjoy a boy with no shirt on running around in his nightmares. On christmas day I was truly dissapointed to see this game under my tree and under some tacky wrapping paper. I was expecting the DS(not in that box) or at least Donkey Kong Country 2. I am not a fan of tak games I am not into magic and all that crazy crap. As I played the game, it was okay, not good but okay, but it got a little fustrating for me and I started to hate it. It is expecially fustrating when you run out of power and it makes an annoying sound when you try to doing an action using your staff. After that one day I stopped playing it. I let my godbrother borrow it (he is into that stuff) and he kept it instead, but I didn't care, it's not like I wanted it back. Overall this game has okay gameplay, corny graphics, and overall, to me it is between horrible and alright"
5,Review of Catherine Marchese's Bassoon Recital,"Catherine Marchese moves her listeners with her incredible tone and phrasing. Her ability to make the bassoon sing is unbelievable. I not only own and enjoy her recital disk, but am inspired by transcriptions for bassoon and piano of Satie's work performed my Ms. Marchese and Mr. Emile Naoumoff."
2,Little New Here.,"Q: If you are writing a biography of a famous author, using recycled material, what can you add to make it sell anyway? A: Claim that the author was gay! (Some people say that you could add insight, but Mr. Hoffman disagrees). Hoffman bases his assumption of homosexuality on the following ""evidence"": 1. Mark Twain had very close male friends. 2. Mark Twain lived with his male friends. 3. Mark Twain went on road trips with his male friends. (Fraternity brothers beware, Hoffman is coming after you next!) This is just another example of people who don't want to do their research. I'm sure Hoffman looked a lot at the life of Samuel Clemens, but it seems he didn't do his background material. Many, many people from this era are assumed gay because of the extremely affectionate letters they wrote to their same-sex friends. Guess what? That's just the way they wrote. There are better biographies out there, and they're not too hard to find."
4,Great introduction to the life of America's greatest writer.,"Hoffman offers an excellent, readable life of America's greatest writer. In its pages, Hoffman reveals the tragedy of Clemens' life; the family problems, the death of his brother, and the loss of his children. With this Hoffman shows a man living a life of great pain and sadness, one who faced a seemingly neverending series of personal crises.Yet this is also the life of a great humorist, and Hoffman shows the reader the man who created Mark Twain, both Clemens' great savior and his unending curse. Hoffman does a great job of showing the links between Clemens' life and the works of Twain, how the pain and tragedy could produce some of the greatest literature in the English language. Though suffering somewhat from scholastic voguishness (his suggestion of Clemens' possible homosexual relationship in Nevada is rather strained), this is definitely a book that people should read to understand both a great American writer and a great American."
5,Return to the Church and beat depression and medication,"Excellent book by a nun who was bipolar. She gives a three step approach to combating depression:1.) Return to the Church: At least continual Mass, Confession, and Eucharist, see a priest, and proper prayer - this will strengthen your soul;2.) Go to regular therapy3.) Medication, if still necessary.I have followed her guidelines and have made the most improvement in many years compared to solely medicine regimes.Short, easy to read, and enlightening. If you consider yourself a Catholic/Christian and have been away from the Church, not practicing your religion, and have had problems with depression/bipolar - this book will give you a whole new prospective and approach to combating this horrible condition they call depression."
5,"Quick, painless, and effective","I only even heard of Neti pots in the last year. I have had multiple sinus infections and antibiotic prescriptions -- usually twice a year for several years now -- and wanted to learn if there were any natural way to avoid the chronic sinus infections. I have tried several Neti pot types, but this is my favorite because it's the right size, unbreakable, and comes with a measuring spoon that assures just the right amount of salt so the warm water doesn't burn. I have not had a sinus infection (or even a cold) for nearly a year now. Neti is the way to go."
5,One of the greatest inventions of all time!,"I've always had sinus problems. I dreaded allergy season and being around pets of any kind and I would constantly go through boxes and boxes of tissue. An acupuncturist friend of mine recommended getting a neti pot, and having tried almost everything under the sun, I did and it has been one of the best purchases I've ever made. My nose isn't nearly as runny as it used to be, and I can actually breathe freely and clearly now. I can also be around pets for longer periods of time than I used to. I would HIGHLY recommend this to anyone who has sinus issues. In fact, I'm buying one for my friend for Christmas."
3,Crammed facsimile cheapens the content,"I'll defer to others on the value of the content of Buck. But the paperback edition from Chicago is to be avoided unless absolutely necessary. They've shrunk the pages such that four pages of Buck fit on each printed page (8.5 x 11) of this facsimile reprint. The margins are altogether too crowded, and reading in columns is strange. Some italic print is almost too small to be legible. Do your best to locate an older used copy of Buck (even if it is more expensive) before settling for this edition."
4,Solid all around,"I believe this is Freescha's best, to this date. Church music is, by far, my favorite Freescha song. If you get any of their CD's, this should be the one."
5,Superb for Southpaws!,"I bought this for a left-handed co-worker to use after having one too many botched orders. She's smart as a whip, so I wondered if her being a lefty was a factor in her measuring abilities. Turned out it was! Anyway, she loved this thing, and I can see why. You can read it upside down, right side up, from the left or the right, it's easy to read the fractions...etc etc. It's a solid tape, well built, a little bulky, but you know it's going to hold up to some abuse that way.I have no clue what it must be like to be a lefty in a right-handed world, but this tape makes life easier for everyone. I've had this for 3 years and it's held up to all sorts of abuse. Love it!!"
5,I go trough about a tape every two months,"As a finish carpenter and cabinetmaker i go through a lot of tapes. U ised to try and by for durability, but the Fat Max tapes are not durable or as cheap as this tape. I will NEVER buy another fat max tape. Not only is this an easy to read tape, but the price is very fair compared to its durability.only cons is:1 its hard to read inches from a distance, if you have to fold the tape and read the height if a wall stick to a regular tape. The labeling is GREAT for cabinets, hard to read on walls."
2,Lefty tape measure,I made a hugh mistake and missed that it was a left/right tape measure. I just wanted left. The numbering is too small because it accommodates left or right use. I'm disappointed in the product but I guess it's my fault for not reading the description correctly.
3,Nice feel but not good for inside measures,"Since the clip on the end does not slide, you end up about a 16"" off when you measure between to objects. The numbers are large and easy to read. You don't get any symbols blocking the tick marks."
1,Worth as much as a 3 dollar bill,"I used this tape for 15 minutes, then the blade broke in half. The description that claims the blade is thicker than usual, but in actuality, blade is thinner than most.It was a shame as this tape had so many good things going for it."
5,Happy somebody bringin new talent 2 the stage,"Wanna say congrats to my man John Legend for putting out a song that is crazy. Y'know what I'm sayin. He just trying to bring it up w/o putting much hate in2 the song. The song just kinda reminds me we needed sum more talent people that can sing, rap, play or whatever who can bring a positive message to the community of Hip-Hop and R&B. Anyway luv the song. But the beat 2 it reminds of Talib Kweli's song ""Get By"" which was put out in '02 maybe similar to the 1 that is played 2day. Look forward of buying the new album from him and may God bless. Thanks John Legend for all your success."
5,"Solid, insightful look below the covers of B2B marketplaces","While it appears that the stock market has lost faith with B2B pure-plays, this book highlights the power of new B2B business models. It's clear that there's more to come in B2B... even if Dot-coms don't capture all of the ultimate value.I particulary enjoyed the section by Tempkin at Forrester Research. It provided a powerful look at how the Internet would ultimately impact businesses. While I'm not totaly convinced that the Internet will completely change how big, established businesses operate, his chapter was extremely thought provoking and should probably be read by any business executive thinking about what eBusiness will mean to them."
3,Entertaining,"I've enjoyed this game to an extent,have had better,but then,have had worse.It's cute,all in all,haven't finished it yet,but I'll get there!The seller was awesome,did as they said & the product was in great condition."
1,Tak 1 was better.,This game was kinda boring because this game was very easy and I can beat it like 1 day.Tak 1 have more levels than this game.I cant wait for tak 3.
2,This game was TERRIBLE!!!!!,"This game was terrible. At first I was excited because I liked the first Tak, but as soon as I started playing it I was bored. They make the first part with getting this candy hard, and by the time you figure that out your already bored. I put that away for about 6 months and then I played it again to give it another chance, but I was just as bored. All around, a really stupid game. I would not recommend this game for anyone. This was a waste of money, and a waste of time. Do not buy it!"
3,Awesome!,This game looks so cool I saw it on tv and it was awesome! I have Tak and the power of juju and he looks youngerin that one.you could have hours of fun with this game although I do get frustrated at hard parts but overall I so reccomend this game it's awesome!
5,tak2 even better!,Tak 2 is suppost to be better than the first one! i cant wait for it to come out. you are supost to be able to go in tak's dreams and word is there is a lot more action!
1,The Dumbest Game In The Universe,Tak 2 has to be the worst game ever!!! It should be for kids under 1 month old. TTTTTaaaaakkkk iiiissssss ssssstttttttuuuuuuppppiiiiidddddd! Warning: May cause lack of brains. I hate this game. I rate this game negative one hundred thousand!
4,It Rocks!!!!,"This game is hard but I love it. It is so much better than Power of Juju. That game is pretty cool too. This one isn't as boring as some people say. Granted, it can get a tiny bit boring but overall this game rocks."
4,great rockin'sound that kicks!!!,"this cd by queens to eden has a 70's+80's rock feel to it. but has a lot or todays rock sound to it two. not like ""grunge"".thank goodness!!! PLAIN+SIMPLE IT ROCKS!!!! can't wait to see them live!!!"
3,OK,"I saw them open up for Creed in concert. The CD is OK, but does not show much by way of variety. Almost every song sounds the same. I was looking for more range."
4,Must Have,"I took a chance on this CD, having never heard them before, And man was I blown away, this CD has been in my CD Changer since the day I received it, and still is. if you like steroside you will enjoy Queens to Eden"
5,Albums that can not miss,"All I can say about this album is wow. I play this album at least once a day. There is not a bad song on the album. Current single of 151 is very good. The song If U R ( My Antidote ) should be their next single, very catchy chorus. The ballad ""Comin' Home ( A Stranger )"" dedicated to the men and women of the armed forces is a sure winner. Saw them open up for Tesla on their current tour. Phenomonal energy, they played for approximately 45 minutes and got the crowd totally amped. The second act for the concert was another new band, Poets and Pornstars equally impressive and energetic. Their album will be released 21 August 2007. Highly recommend buying both albums."
5,Amazing !,"This is one of the most innovative and well crafted recordings I have heard this year. A group of five young Argentine musicians and the experienced and well known Pedro Aznar get together in a monastery and record a dozen ""new-tango"" gems. The percussion is simply fantastic, among the best you'll hear anywhere. The recording is of uusual purity (96 Khz, single point) and meticulously presented. The instrumentation deserves six stars ! Aznar's voice is good, but perhaps if anything the weakest link here, although that is a matter of personal taste. If you are into acoustic Jazz and want to hear something new do not miss this !"
5,Crackpots unite!,"So British! A delight for the likes of me. The only time he seems to have been caught out in this entire series of crackpot letter writing was by the Oxford University Admissions Tutor who hit the nail right on the head, realising that Root is a fraud!Neverhteless, this is the kind of treatise that keeps spirits high and makes one wish one had thought of it first. Well done, Root's alright!"
4,An interesting comedy in letters,"This book makes a good read when you only have a brief time for reading; the book is composed of photocopies of Root's letters. He writes to various important British persons, sharing his ideas and political opinions with them. The letters from Mr. Root are funny in their sarcasm and wit, but it's the responses he receives that really make the book hilarious. I especially liked the occasional bribe that Root would include to elicit a response. My only word of warning- if you're not into British humor, then you might find this book to be a dry read."
3,Mixed Review,"I just first off want to say I like Acid Baths other recordings besides this one. This one is demos, so of course there is going to be alot of diffrences between the two recordings and this one. I dont want to personally give it a bad review, but in all honesty, I didnt like it. It was basically a diffrent version of the songs. I am not a big demos fan personally though, I am more of a collector. Would I reccomend it if your a collector, or you enjoy demo recordings? Yes. Would I reccomend it as an introduction to Acid Bath? No, Personally if you want a good introduction to the band I would say Paegan Terrorism Tactics would be the best introduction to Acid Bath. I would say for a die hard fan of Acid Bath, you will love it. Id say its just mediocre, I find myself skipping songs but Acid Bath is not my all time favorite band. They are one of my top ten though."
4,eye opener sensational,this book is about someone who cares about our youth.now she is a politician im happy to see this.as a police officer in camden city i know there is hope for the younger generation.my name is bob chew #1152 . mary previte tells a good story and the funny thing is it's true
1,don't buy this,"I am a big fan of Leiji Matsumoto - his Harlock (or shall I say, Albator?) series are among my favorite anime. So, I bought this set last sunday at Fry's. However, I was very disappointed by it.In fact, worse than that, I was offended, in particular by episode 2 on the first disc. That single episode manages at once to discriminate against gays, and vilify native americans and French - all of whom are part of my family. Maybe it's fashionable to do so in Japan, but it sure didn't go over well at my home !Unfortunately, this title has no offsetting redeeming qualities. The animation was nothing special, the music very uninspiring to non-existent. The plot obviously tried to parody western movies, but the humor was repetitive, and hardly funny the first time.I watched 3 episodes, and I don't think I can stand watching the rest."
3,Mediocre Book,"Greg Cihlar's Fabulous Military Diorama's is a suprisingly average publication. What you get with the book is bright, fancy color pictures, but very little substance. There is little detail on the planning of the diorama's and the actual steps involved in making the diorama's.In a nutshell, the book is a advertisement for Verlinden Products."
4,loved these videos,we see these episodes on TV sometimes but they don't show the whole thing so when I seen this on Amazon I had to get it.
3,"it is not clear the size, it is important to ad the age range","In the diferents ages, the supplier has the same numbers for the shoes, it creates some confusion, in my last purchase I receive the shoes for a boy around 2 years, but muy boy has 9 years old. I think it is important to add more information, to do not have this kind of mistakes. I live out of the states, and now it is almost imposible to change the product.Thank you"
2,Test before buying...,You have to be a fan of the Green Tea smell to appreciate this scent. For me personally I do not like this scent and it sets off my allergies. I would recommend you go and get a sample at your closest Arden counter and then try it out. As it also changes dramatically from the bottle to your skin.
3,Extremely Helpful,I needed a book like this to assist me as I read my Bible. I found it very helpful.
2,good price but not reliable,"It's a good deal considering that Verizon wants about $50 for the same thing ... but mine only worked for about 6 months. What the heck, I bought another one. It's worth the price, but a little bit annoying."
2,falls apart,"I managed to polish my car with it, barely. It fell apart over the period of an hour and a half. I had hoped to wash and reuse which was out of the question."
2,Warning: Not for Small Children!,"I was very surprised at some of the graphic pictures in this ""kiddie"" book. The afterbirth underneath Mary at Jesus' birth, the beheaded children with horrific expressions when King Herod ordered the 1st born killed, the knife held to the naked baby at the ""circumcision"", and a veiled insinuation that the holy ghost had a ""relation"" with Mary resulting in her impregnation. I thought it was just me so I showed it to a few others to see if it bothered them (parents/adults) and they picked out most of the same things. I would not give this to children. It just has some poor judgement calls in the items he chose to illustrate with. What could have been really cute became unsettling."
3,Interesting oddity but a little raw humor,This was a neat book to give as a holiday gift to a lego buff adult friend of mine. The text is the straight traditional Christmas story but the pictures poke fun in an edgy way. There is a huge knife in the circumcision page and broken lego babies where king Herod kills the babies looking for Jesus. The angel Gabriel has a 5 o'clock shadow all the time for some reason. There is a red lego block standing in for blood below Mary at the birth of Jesus. Personally I would have loved to have only cute feel good images all the way which is why I rate this book only three stars. If you like the naughty humor you might rate this a five star.
2,Not a childrens' portrayal of the Christmas story ...,"Do not assume, just because Legos are involved, that this is a book to share with young children. The Holy Ghost is a frightening character, circumcision is accomplished with a knife the size of the infant Jesus, and the illustration of Herod's order to slaughter all male infants less than two years of age is complete with decapitated infants in the background! Both frightening and disappointing!"
5,sewing marking white pencil,It's a sewing white marking pencil. It works good.What more can I say. Buy it - it works good.I have no complaints about it. I use it.
4,written by a true lover of the Bible,AfterLife: A Glimpse of Eternity Beyond Death's DoorA great read & right in line with the Scriptures
2,Disappointing theology,"I wanted to read After Life because I really enjoyed Smith's thoughts in a previous work on the role of youth groups in the church today, and because it's true--we don't talk about hell as other than a place to go. However, I found it difficult to get past the first chapter! Eventually I did, but the twisted theology Smith employs in the first few pages is a with Bible verses and a good commentary will out the truth. I am sorely disappointed and expect better from an author I'd like to admire again."
1,Boring,"Bought for My Grandson, because he like the sponge bob war.When asked how he liked it he said it was boring."
5,does this game work for xbox360 orignal one?,"My son wants this game for xbox 360 original one,will it work? Any help would be nice before I do buy it and it don't work...thanx"
5,"Great game, great buy.","I ordered this game for my 7 yr (this is our 2nd copy, he wore the first one out) as it is one of his favorite games. Disc was in good condition as stated and the shipping was phenominally fast. Great buy!"
4,A company can control its succession fate or a competitor will do it -,"The two most important roles that a corporate Board of Directors (BOD) plays are its governance responsibility and CEO succession planning. However, within this passing decade it has become critically important for the succession planning process to be pushed beyond the BOD, much deeper into the organization. In ""Growing Your Company's Leaders"" the authors expertly address the ever-changing rules in the game of attracting top talent, stressing the need for competitive companies to have a strong handle on the succession process - or face the consequences. Soundview recommends this book because it's ultimately people who run organizations and it's up to the leaders to inspire a vision among employees. Given the dynamism of the talent market, companies need to decide their own succession fate or their competitors might do it for them."
3,A pretty-good book,"Recently, My reading class had to read the novel ""Let The Circle Be Unbroken"" by Mildred Taylor. I thought this book was very historical since it was in Mississippi, in the 1930's. They tell of all the conflicts that happened in the story, such as racial conflicts between blacks and whites. My opinion is that the racial issues in this story, make the book a lot less good. Otherwise, this book would be wonderful."
3,An O.K. sort of book!,"Recently the book,""Let The Circle Be Unbroken,"" by Mildred Taylor was read. In my opinion it was a wonderful novel.The reason I like this story so much is because, the was all of the details and words fall right into place and describe things in just the right order. If it were me I would only recommend this book to only children that are nine years and older because they would learn how things worked in the 1930's, also how people suffered slavery and emotional problems:"
3,Let the Circle Be Unbroken,"Let the Circle Be Unbroken by Mildred D. Taylor Is the sequel to Roll of Thunder Hear My Cry. This Book Is About Mississippi in the 1930s. In it, it has T.J.'s trial, Suzella tries to be white. Her neighbor, Mrs. Lee Annie trie to register to vote. I give this book 3 out of 5 stars."
3,Let The Circle Be Unbroken,The title of this book is Let The Circle Be Unbroken. The auther of this book is Mildred Taylor and this book takes place in the 1930's. It is about a family named the logans and all their troubles like getting arrested and gets trown off their land. What I liked about this book is that they are seriouse about almost everything and don't want anyone to be hurt. I think this book would be perfect for kids to read.
3,Not as Good as Roll of Thunder...,"This story continues the Logan family saga from where Roll of thunder ended. However, this book has none of the charm that Roll of Thunder displays so beautifully. In this book the Logan family deals with more issues that threaten either their surrvival or their integrity and predictably rise above it all.For L.A. Teachers: The book is longer then Roll of Thunder. And while it answers some questions that Roll of Thunder Left unanswered; it isn't worth the time. When it's so hard to get kids to read any book, a book that makes you fight to finish it is the last thing teachers need to push in the classroom. Let them read Roll of Thunder, it's a great book. That can be the class wide book, then if anyone wants to explore further they can read this book on their own."
2,Takes a surprisingly bitter tone...,"In ""Roll of Thunder, Hear My Cry"", Mrs. Taylor wrote matter-of-factly, without bitterness, and left the story 'innocent' yet revealing. Now, in this sequel, bitterness is evident in many chapters. It isn't about hating whites, but it does harangue the reader about the past, as if somehow they are responsible and as if it were still being done. The point of the story is made rather ineffectively, then, and the reader is left reading without emotion....signed, a 17 y\o without an account"
1,World`s Stupidest Book!!!!!,"Let the Circle be Unbroken is a novel by Mildred D. Taylor, and I believe it is worse than its predecessor, Roll of Thunder, Hear my Cry. If you like books with things like missing people,trials,and things like that I highly recomend this book. But if you like books based on a cartoon series, movies, or a normal T.V. series, I do NOT recomend this book AT ALL!It takes place in the 1930`s when there was still segregation and the Jim Crow Laws. As you may know, this takes place 30 years before Martin Luther King Jr. was even born.I extremely HATE this book!!!!Do NOT buy this!!!"
1,Crappy,Nothing more to say than that. This was a really bad book. It had a crooked storyline: Black people who don't like whites do stuff to stand up for themselves. Then they gret killed.
3,Let the circle be unbroken review,"This book,let the circle be unbroken,is a very good book. Though it is serious, it teaches how hard it was for African Americans to live during this period of time, in the south. This book has hard things happening all the time but the logan family always sticks together to get through all of their problems. I liked this book, because it wasn't boring, something was always happening and it made you want to keep reading. Some of the scenes refer back to the other scenes so it makes the scene cool relizing why something happened. If you are thinking about reading this book I would rekamend reading the first one first to make the seconded book make more sense. The other book is called Roll of thunder hear my cry. I think it is easier to get into the book Let the circle be unbroken."
4,Cassie and Stacey are much older here and so is their town,"Let the circle be unbroken starts where Roll of Thunder, Hear My Cry broke off, but it is a much maturer book and deals with the issues very directly. This reflects how much the characters have changed and matured. Stacey runs off to the cane fields when money gets short, and Cassie has started to have adolescent feelings which cannot be ignored. I definitely recommmend this book to anyone who has read Roll of Thunder, but if you haven't then start with that to get to know the essence of the characters before they start to change. This book was sad but more hopeful near the end that Roll of Thunder."
5,A tear jerker,"This book is a continuation of Roll of Thunder, Hear My Cry. In this book, Stacey's friend T.J. is brought to an all-white trial and charged with murdering. I usually never cry by books, but I cried and cried by this one. It is so moving and so lifelike. Mildred D. Taylor writes in passive and heart-wrenching tones that make this book a real page-turner. I recommend it highly to anyone, and also be sure to read the prequel, Roll of Thunder, Hear My Cry, and the third book, The Road To Memphis."
4,A book that can teach.,"The book that I have just finished reading is Let The Circle Be Unbroken. The book was written by Mildred Taylor. The book is very exciting. Then it can be very sad. The things I like about this book is there was a trial. The trial was very interestig. It made not want to put the book down.The things I didn't like about the book is there was alot of racism going on. I found out about stuff I never even knew. Like how bad black people were treated,they were treated much then they said they were. I recomend this book if you really wantlearn about stuff that happened back then in Mississippi. I do not recomend this book if you can not stand the way black people were treated back then. Basicly I want some people to read this book so everyone will be glad on how they treated. I give this book four stars."
4,Well done,"I read ""Roll of Thunder, Hear my Cry"" as a child growing up in 70's suburbia. I loved the book and grew fond of the Logan family. It was only last year when I realized there were sequels.As a homeschooling parent I opted to read ""Roll of Thunder, Hear my Cry"" to my 10 year old son this year. I purchased ""Let the Circle be Unbroken"" with the possibility of reading it to my son this year as well. This book is equally well-written, however the themes in this books are more mature than the previous one. Therefore, I would not just hand this book to a younger child. There is a difference in the level of innocence, but I believe that it added value and reality to the story. The author allows Cassie to grow up. I believe this book would be an invaluable resource for any high school level student. There are many talking points about injustice that can be taken from this book. I do plan to read this with my son, but we will wait a few years."
5,MrFKIA,This product is great for tires and I go out of my way to find it. I was glad to find the gallon size. It's more economical to buy the bulk size and refill the sprayers.
2,1 of 3,1 of 3 seed types even sprouted. The one that did sprout grew very healthy and I eventually put it in all 3 buckets and had it get very healthy. That still doesn't fix the fact that I should have three different herb types.
2,Doesn't grow anything,This is not a good product if you really want to grow herbs. There's not enough room for them to root. They died and I ended up putting fake stems in them.
4,Very Small,"Pots are extremely attractive, but much smaller than I was imagining they would be...but for an inside herb garden, I guess that could be a plus. I have not planted the seeds that come with it, I bought these to plant cat grass and cat nip for my kitties. Aside from wishing they were a smidge bigger, I am pleased with this cute little set."
2,no grow,"after 2 months, i have sprouts, but not likely any useful ones for months, if ever.. the chives never came up. it may be direct sunlight is needed.."
4,"Very nice, a bit pricey","Bought this as a gift, and it will make a very nice one. Attractively designed, and it came in a sturdy box which helped it travel without damage. Seemed a little pricey for what you get, especially when you include the shipping charge."
5,Jaded colored Ceramic Herb Garden,Wonderful to receive such a beautiful herb garden in the middle of winter for a person I was gifting to. I didn't expect it to be so nice. Nothing was broken and received it in plenty of time for Christmas. Exactly what I was looking for. Thank you!
4,Very good book,very instructive and good for newly married couples and people that are planning to get married. Very detailed and it is a very good guide for both men and women.
1,Move along nothing to see here. Seeds are useless,We received this as a gift and although the planter is cute the seeds are worthless. Followed instructions to the letter and nothing sprouted after ten days. Seeing what is being charged for the item it's embarrassing at best. For the price you could get three very nice starter pots and plants from your local home or garden center.
3,Ok,The planter is nice and looks great in my home but the herbs never grew. I followed the instructions with no results.
3,"Pretty, but very small","I got this herb garden about a month ago, and even though I planted some seeds on the first day, I still haven't had any usable herbs. This partially because this thing is SO small. It takes a long time to grow anything and a lot of things don't grow in it.I recommend NOT using the blow-up soil they give you but instead getting some real soil from a gardening supply store, and mix up some fertilizer in there for great results.I'm ordering another one now, not because I think i'll get more herbs, but just because it looks so pretty at my window."
3,Nice containers; seeds didn't grow,"I hope to re-plant with different seeds and soil soon, as this didn't grow and I thought I did everything correctly."
3,Not Complete,"I thought this was ready to go, but now I've got to get some soil to begin. This is a very small unit, so I don't see the herbs lasting long without transplanting. But it's cute in the window.I didn't like having to contact the seller to request they ship it. It was nearly 5 days after ordering it that it shipped!"
3,Don't Order From This Company!,"I purchased this at the end of July, in anticipation of moving from NYC to NC. Last week, I finally got to the box that contained this set. Much to my chagrin, it was missing one out of three herb packs. I do not know which one is missing, as they are not labelled. Additionally, I received no soil, and no growing instructions. The trio itself is cute, and looks nice on my kitchen windowsill. I contacted the company, twice and never received a response from them. I finally had to contact Amazon, who did an A-Z guarantee. All I wanted was a pack of herbs, but the company couldn't be bothered to respond to me. If you really like this, look around and purchase it elsewhere."
1,The pots are good and thats about it,"The pots are the only good thing about this product. The soil will not grow the seeds enclosed, the seeds would not grow in different soil. Just plan on buying new seeds and soil if you decide to go with this product. I followed the instructions, I had nothing grow. The second time i tried it i had about 10 little chive plants grow and that was it. I even changed the soil i used to grow the same seeds. I have since reused the pots with different herb garden products purchased and they seem to be working. Thats the only thing that is though!"
2,More of a toy than a window garden,"I bought this to try out indoor herb gardening and am overall disappointed.The ceramic set is nice, but very small - while it will fit on a window sill, it won't produce anything that suffices past just a decoration (not much too eat). The soil that came with it was convenient, but I'd rather purchase potting soil separately since it was a mess to make and didn't seem to yield good results. The seeds sprouted, but maybe only 30% of what was planted.It has been a month (I've attached a photo), but I wouldn't recommend this to anyone. Instead I will be trying: [...]"
2,SCS collectibles was not honest,"This arrived without any soil when the description states ""Includes organic soil."" Soil is cheap but it creates some hassle when one doesn't have any usable soil on hand. Would be 5 stars otherwise."
2,Can't Grow Herbs With No Seeds!!!!!,"How disappointing! I ordered this product as a gift for my herb-loving father for Christmas, only to find AFTER he got it and opened it that it did not contain any seeds! Of course, finding gardening seeds in the dead of winter is no simple feat, and for the almost $40 (with shipping) that I paid for this item, I would not expect to have to deal with trying to find them anyhow. And trying to find a number or email address to contact the seller is impossible! I wasted 2 days looking, and finally decided to just post my disappointment as a review, and make sure not to buy from this seller again."
4,Quick Summer Read,"I've really enjoyed this series, but I felt this book in the series was by far the lamest.The plot was very predictable and obvious. Though I didn't know exactly who the murderer was until the end, I felt that was more because I didn't try too hard to figure it out. Other aspects of the story were blatantly being set up for other purposes and I found myself trying to figure out what those were instead...and on those items, I was never wrong.Still a very nice, easy summer read that only took me a few hours."
2,"FOOD AND HEALING, Colbin","350 pages: lots of words for little information. And some very strange theories.I've offered this for swap, will continue to use other books in my library for solid, less verbose, info.I don't recommend this book; you can do better."
3,Cleavage Problem,"The queen's revealing outfit was embarrassing, and detracted from what would have been a fun, although low-budget, movie."
3,"Beware, this is not a greeting card","My definition of a greeting card is a card that is folded. These are post cards. They are single 4x6 sheets with matte coating on each side. The stock is very lightweight, so the envelopes are necessary for mailing."
1,Bland and Boring,"I have nothing but the utmost respect for the Moosewood and their pioneering role in moving vegetarian fare into the mainstream. As an institution, though, it seems like something of a sacred cow, with vegetarians all over touting it.But this vegetarian doesn't get it. This is the third Moosewood cookbook I've tried. I keep thinking that I've just picked up the wrong cookbook, that somewhere in one of their books I will find food that has me dreaming of the next time I get to eat it. But it never happens. It isn't that the recipes are bad - you do end up with an edible and vaguely satisfying meal in the end. But the meal tends to be a bit bland and, I'm sorry, boring. There are much better vegetarian and vegan cookbooks out there."
5,If you like food...,"...you'll like this book. I would even venture to say, you'll love this book! It's not just for vegetarians or crunchy types either. Perfect for your meat-and-potatoes loving housemate, this book proves that vegetarian cooking can be flavorful, quick, healthful, and cheap! Combining a variety of flavors and cuisines, I often find myself looking for an excuse to cook dinner using this book. Complete with menu suggestions and clear type not found in the old seventies Moosewood cookbooks, this book is almost too easy to use. You'll never spend more than 40 minutes cooking dinner ever again. And for those of you who don't have a dishwasher, that is key!"
3,"not bad, not great","I had high hopes for this book, but I never actually made anything from it. It did have some interesting recipes, just nothing that really appealed to me. I was hoping for a few more tofu dishes, but there were only one or two. The fish section was almost completely fish-in-a-packet recipes, which looked quick and easy, but just didn't seem all that interesting. i really don't make salads or soups, so those sections were out. Not much into lentils and beans, so again, that chapter and recipes were out. However, nothing seemed too complex, none of the ingredients too expensive or hard to find, and most of the recipes did seem good for everyday meals. If you're a proper vegetarian or vegan and don't mind skipping over some fish recipes, this book probably has some interesting dishes for you. However, pescetarians might be a little underwhelmed with the fish options. I actually ended up giving the book to a vegetarian friend, hopefully he'll get more use out of it."
4,Yummy and not too difficult!,This was a gift for my mother and she loved it. At 84 she is trying to cook healthier foods.
5,One of my favorite cookbooks!,"I own nearly all of the Moosewood Collective cookbooks, and this is by far my favorite. I use it 2-3 times a week. Most of the recipes use inexpensive ingredients and they are all fast and easy to prepare. A few were too bland for my taste, but on the whole the recipes are a big hit in my home. My two very favorite recipes are ""Cajun skillet beans"" and ""Tortellini Tomato Soup""."
2,NOT WORTH PRICE,Sent the book back when I saw how small it was. It would have been better if it had been $12.95. Book was definitely not worth $30.
4,Life or Death,"Could you imagine losing over one-forth of the U.S. population and evacuating many states because of one disease, the Strain 7? People everywhere not knowing what to do with themselves, because many jobs are now worthless. Quit imagining. A small group of people who can't stand the outer world form a town letting people join only to make them stronger.One of the many things I liked about this book were the different lives all seven people were leading to have all ended up at the same place. Another thing I liked was the drama that happened to each person because there was never a dull moment. One of my dislikes would have to be the ending because it wasn't how I had expected it to end.I think that if you have ever read The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants then this would be a great life drama story for you to try."
2,a good read for one interested in the blind and deaf,"The book was great for learning how someone who is both deaf and blind views the world. Sadly, I felt exhausted after finishing it because this man's life went by so slowly, like it would never end or bring lasting happiness."
5,This book is cool,This book contains 7 full books (complete and unabridged) by Paul Gallico. The books are:1. Mrs. 'arris Goes to Paris2. Mrs. 'arris Goes to New York3. Mrs. 'arris Goes to Parliament4. The Snow Goose5. The Small Miracle6. Ludmila7. Coronation
1,"Ebay Motors, the smart way","""eBay Motors, the smart way"". Obviously written by a ghost writer, who relates the information second hand. A poorly written book. Lots of useless, impractical dictionay style information. The two ""crafty"" authors make a feeble attempt at providing actual applicable selling and buying methods, however they fail miserably. On a positive note, a real catchy cover. Numerous blank pages inside, lots of white pages of air space. An obvious attempt at stretching this book out to 290 pages. Frankly, after purchasing and reading, it was a total waste of time and money. This book is a real ""dud"". Peter Vrouhas, Boynton Beach, FL"
2,Very limited...,"I couldn't find a lot of real information for buying and selling on e-bay with this book. The book seems to have more on common sense than on laws and regulations. I admit that I bought the book to learn more about buying and selling as a hobby and I find it more directed at first time buyers or buyers only interested in buying or selling once. He gives no references to state laws or regulations. I found that in order to make the book work I had to find majority of the important information online.This book is good for people that are looking for an overview of what to look for in cars on e-bay motors. It's an easy read with large print (much how the Dummies books are written). If you're looking for e-bay ""know how"" experience, it's not here, so if you are new to e-bay, you should buy a separate book.Overall, I think the book could have been better. It seemed to be a fill in the blanks kind of book when I was looking for answers."
5,Skype conference box,"compact design skype conference box that has all the features and buttons. this unit does require driver but it is easy to install. There is also a handset comes with the unit if you would rather use the unit like a regular telephone. The sound quality is O.K., not the BOSE quality, but you can turn it loud and the sound is acceptable. the microphone can pick up the sound around 10-15 feet away. It can be used when traveling or office conference. I use the unit daily and find it convenience and it is USB interface. It also has a plug in for headset. It is not a stereo speaker so you can't play music in stereo. Good pricing and fast shipping from DSI."
4,kneedit knee support,This product workshop very well. It really supported. My knees and made it possible to get though the work day
