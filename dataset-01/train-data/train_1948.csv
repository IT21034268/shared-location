5,The results speak for themselves,"My neighbor bought this workout and got great results. I tried it out, I did every workout for 90 days and stuck to the diet 99%, two days I ate like I wasn't supposed to.I have wrist, elbow, knee and back problems, years of basketball. At the end of the 90 days I had virtually no joint pain. I did not do the full range of motion early on, I worked my way into it.End result, I lost 32 pounds and looked good enough that I put my before and after pictures on facebook. It is a difficult series to make it through and my wife can't stick to the diet. She does the workouts 3 to 5 times a week and looks much better now than she did before she started.Very good workout to get you looking good and feeling good."
5,THIS WILL WORK....BUT YOU GET WHAT YOU GIVE!,"Although I have just started the P90x full 90 day program I did the exercises 2-3 times a week for 3 weeks in an attempt to get ready. Let me just say that these workouts are hard, but very possible. Tony has set it up for almost any level to do what you can, and keep doing more reps or more weight as you need to. I did the chest and back exercise first and could hardly raise my arms to dry off after my shower, LOVED IT! I used to always work out in high school but 4 years of college and I've definitely slipped, but P90X gives you that desire/hunger again to be healthier! I highly recommend P90X to anyone who is serious about weightloss or toning!? You can go spend money on books, miracle pills or electrical gimics but NONE OF THEM WORK LIKE GOOD OLD FASHION WORK! Buy P90X and get ready to BRING IT!"
2,P90X,"Bought the set - 13 DVD's, one DVD will not play in my laptop, another one bounces around. The laptop is a new hp.The program is great, love the workouts.Just not satisfied that only 11 of the 13 DVD's work properly."
5,"Works well, you will sweat buckets.",I thought I was already in so-so shape before I got these discs. The program quickly lets you know that you are not as fit as you thought you were.I have never sweat so much in my life. I recommend this package if you want to get in shape at home instead of hitting the gym.
4,Great workout,"This workout is very motivating and tough. I've really felt great doing these workouts. I've gone to a gym for two years and was getting in a rut and not motivated at all. Now I feel very motivated doing all the dvd's and sweating after each one.The only complaint isnt with the workout but it's the books and poster. There are a ton of grammer and spelling mistakes. Doesnt anyone there have spell check? I guess it's just a peeve but maybe thats why it was so much cheaper than the one on their website.Anyhow, it is a great workout and after two weeks I've lost about 5 lbs and feel stronger. Highly recommend it."
1,"Needs more focus on workouts, less on Tony Horton","The workouts were ok a couple times through them, but Tony Horton is very annoying to me and I get sick of watching him every day. He doesn't inspire me to work hard and he doesn't explain some stuff very well and he's always saying stupid stuff that is ok the first time you hear it but gets old hearing it every week. I tried doing the workouts with the sound off but that doesn't work very well. I wish someone would tell him to shut up and do the workouts. And then the ladies, the uglier they are the more he flirts with them. It always gave me bad mental images."
2,"Good workout, bad price","I'm a grad student, and finding time to get to the gym has been getting difficult (read, impossible). I've been thinking about P90x for months, reading reviews, working out at a friends house because she's raved about it since early 2010, and have come ""this"" close to buying it numerous times. I just can't get past the price tag! Is it hype? While I've been debating, I've been losing weight, muscle, energy - which is the worst part because I intern at a psych hospital and need to be on alert. Finally, this month, I cancelled my gym membership and decided the next paycheck would go to finally ordering P90 and joining the multitudes. That's when I stumbled upon Bareweight.com, its free workout videos, meals, and advisors. In your face P90x, in your face Sarah (with love), and in your face hype beasts. I'll just put that $100-$150 dollars and put it right back into my pocket (read, Sallie Mae's pocket). Spread the word!Your next, Macbook Pro."
1,What a Workout,I absolutely love the product but one of the discs doesn't work.I've exercised all my life and this is by far the best workout I'veever had.
1,i was going to buy this till i saw the reviews,too many people state that the dvds are made cheap and that amazon nor beach body will replace the disc free if they come defective that there is a $30 fee for replacement per disc well as someone who is jobless due to the economy and living with family to survive the pit fall of the economy i decided i can't afford to buy a defective product when i rarely have money in my pocket in the first place i will be looking for a better workout dvd
1,deceived,"i did not receive the calendar or fitness guide or workout log,, also the seller has not responded to my email,"
1,DON'T BUY FROM THIS COMPANY,"Product didn't work, they would not return emails,tried to return item. Found out return address did not exist. Beware this company dose not stand by there product(if they are a real business)!!!!!!!!!"
1,Do not order through seller Alice Pipen,"Poor rating due to the shipper; not the product. Buyer beware of buying reburbished items through Alice Pippen.We ordered the set through Alice Pippen via Amazon, and the first 3 discs were completely scratched beyond repair. We contacted Alice Pippen to ask for an exchange of the first 3 or the set or a complete refund within the return policy deadline. We never received any communication back.I repurchased the item brand new via Beachbody and love the product."
1,Not so great buy.,"Paid shipping to have a bad product sent to me. The DVDs would lock up and my player would make grinding noises trying to play the DVDs. Even had trouble getting the DVDs out of the player. Paid shipping to send the bad product back. Received another set of DVDs, just to have the same thing happen. Paid shipping again to send the DVDs back to get a refund. I am out shipping three times."
5,"P90x isn't a workout, it is a philosophy.","You can tell that alot of time was spent making this a complete workout program. From diet to encouragement to recording before, during and after results [...] and Tony Horton have put together an excellent package. I had been working out hard, running and doing sports coming into the program and it is still challenging. The warm ups are great because I have a tendancy to shirk the warm up and cool down."
1,P90x DVDs don't work,"I would highly recommend that you avoid this store. We purchased a P90x workout program. Everything arrived quickly and appeared to be in good order: books, DVDs, and boxes in what appeared to be original packaging. However, only one of the DVDs will play in a normal DVD player (I've tried to play them in three different players) & some don't work in computers. Bottom line: we're incredibly disappointed. An absolutely defected item in a well-packaged box.To add insult to injury, the proprietor never responded to our email requesting either a replacement or a refund. Save yourself time and aggravation. Go elsewhere."
5,Getting me over my workout hump,I workout most days and I have for many years. I have just felt like I had hit a workout hump. I have used personal trainers and nothing has felt as much like a workout as this program. I have a love/hate relationship with it and that was exactly what I have been looking for! I love this workout and my whole body hurts after I do it... Love that!
4,Great Exercise DVDs,"With any exercise program, you get out of it what you put in. If you follow it and use the diet you will see amazing results. I followed the workout but not the diet and still saw some great results. I completed the 90 day program but I still use the DVDs to work out. I just made my own program up. The only reason I give it 4 stars is that it gets repetitive. You do the yoga once every week and 2 times a week on your ""rest"" weeks. Also, plyometrics and kenpo are used every none rest week. Wish there was more variety because you start to get bored doing a workout when it's the same thing over and over again.But overall, a great program and I would recommend to anyone."
5,Looking to get in shape quick?,"Tired of jogging, cardio machines, lack of motivation and no true weight loss plan? Then P90x is for you. Like most, I was skeptical at first but after a 34lb weight loss, I'm a believer. The program will challenge even the most hardcore gym rat and contains alternatives for the brand new beginners. Tony is both motivating and entertaining without becoming pretentious like so many other home video trainers. This is not a gimmick, you will see results, you will lose weight and you will have fun doing it. Buy it now!!"
4,Good but......,"The distributors of this product definitely get your shipment to you in a timely manner. The dvd's were brand new still wrapped and everything, however the reason I gave 4 stars is because the distributor promised a calendar, nutrition guide, workout log, and fitness guide which sadly was not included in the package. The actual product is great but the distributor somewhat rips you off."
4,I got what I paid for... :),"First of all a caveat: I bought a used package and paid half of the cost of a new purchase. So, caveat emptor, right? The package and DVD quality was good, but obviously used... so far, all the DVDs work OK, but some skipping ocassionally. The box that holds the DVDs is coming apart (poor adhesive choice by the mfgr, not due to handling by the seller)... The purchase came without the users guide(s) and diet manuals... while I should have expected an incomplete package based on the price, it would have been a nice touch to point that out in the product description.On a plus point, the order to delivery time was within a week... thanks!"
3,P 90 X,This is a great workout and anybody that says they can do this workout is totally fooling themselves.My only problem with the dvd's is that you are asked to buy so many things from weights to tring to figure out in your house to put a band a chin up bar (Tony Hortons of course) and a heart monitor watch.Other than all these neccesary additions this workout will work you over and for anybody like myself that has worked out with weights for years all these posistions and coordination type workouts are a little frustrating since the dvd's just jump into the workout as if you were a seasoned pilates or aerobic person.All in all very hard and effective workout just be prepared to buy and buy more wihen you purchase the set
3,Not bad,"This is a hell of a lot better than an regular exercise tape. The fitness program itself is pretty good. I started seeing results the first few weeks in terms of toneness. However, the calendar, nutrition guide and workout log were not includedbut they were suposed to be. Also, one of the disks is unreadable in a few spots and I have to fast-forward through several minutes of workout or else the disk freezes. I would really like to have had the schedule and nutrition guide!"
5,Beware your back,"I bought P90X as a gift for my husband but started using it with him. We are both in good shape and consider ourselves above average as athletes. Even with all that, the discs are a challenge and it seems almost impossible to get through all 90 days without interruption. I experienced low back pain as did a friend of mine that competes in triathlons. We both had to quit before the end of the course to let our backs recover. I think the discs are good to use in conjunction with another workout regime, such as swimming, yoga and pilates. Building up bulk without stretching and building your core can be dangerous. That being said, the discs have their place. I use them all but only about 30 minutes of each with the warm-up and cool down."
4,p90X,It took a little bit to arrive but overall satisfied with the product and found it to be fairly priced.
4,Good,it is very good. but at the same time this workout does take quite a while especially if you do the doubles to loose weight.
4,"brand new, slow shipping","I did not want to pay full price for P90X but was tired of using the poor quality burnt DVDs that someone gave me. I purchased this from a seller on Amazon and once I received the product, it was as described; still in the original package. However, the seller did not ship the package as quickly as they said they would and I waited over a week for the item. Shipping is the only reason this product and seller did not receive the full 5 stars. With that being said, P90X is quite the work out and time commitment! I cannot follow the program 6 out of 7 days a week because some days I am quite sore after my work out! You can still have great results by only following the program a few days a week. It is a great full body work out! I have found that you do not have to do EXACTLY what they do on the DVD, but instead do the best that you can and you will still have great results!"
5,I'm addicted,"I love this workout!!!. At first it seemed impossible to do some of the exercises. It gets easier the more you do it, yet it challenges you. I like that there are several workouts so you don't get bored. Tony's awesome!"
5,P90X :-)),"Amazing! Received product immediately and p90x rocks!!! Already lost 11 pounds, can't wait to loose the rest. Workouts are awesome... I highly recommend it!!!"
5,P90-X,Killer workout! I gave up after a few days...but am getting ready to start back up. I am cancelling ALL 3 of my gym memberships!
5,Happy with my purchase of P90X,Very happy with my purchase of P90X. Product came in time indicated and I also loved the extra Excel Worksheet program the seller included (THANKS!!).I would definitely buy from this seller again.
4,Good stuff,"I would have to say that this is a good program. I have only just begun it a few days ago, but am definitely sore already!"
3,P90X Dvd good program but one of the dvd's didn't work.,"This was a Christmas gift for my son. He is, overall, very happy with the P90X. The problem is that one of the Dvds didn't work. It is all pixilated and won't play. We tried to exchange for a new one but no exchange was available. We were refunded immediately and ordered from the Tony Horton website."
4,awesome,Bought it as a gift for my son in law...he loves the workout and the various ways in doing so. Able to follow it without any difficulties.
3,Great Workout,I am still using this workout today. I purchased it at the beginning of 2012 and I am only on my second round of using the program. One of my DVD's are already starting to skip and it does not do this with my other movie DVD's. Not sure why this is happening.
5,P90X really works,The workouts are excellent. Guidance throughout the process is definitely the best I've seen thus far. Options and demonstrations for beginners are provided for each of the advanced exercises. I am quite happy with P90X. The fact that Tony has other reent graduates of the program provides encouragement for those of us who are just getting started.
5,LOVE IT,"Bought this item as a ""used"" item. It came to me in perfect condition, no scratches, even the box looked brand new. Couldn't be happier with this purchase!"
4,Great program but damaged dvd's,"The program is wonderful but the so called ""new in box"" is questionable. Many of the dvd's are scratched and skip. This makes it very frustrating. But I guess you get what you pay for."
5,Legit,Exactly what I wanted for a good price. Have seen quick results and is really easy to use. Would recommend for sure.
5,p90x,"This is a great program, but you must devote time and effort for success. Dont overdo it at the beginning or you will want to quit. Take your time and do each exercise properly, and the results will follow."
4,We shall see,So far so good. Price is a little high and the DVD set was last updated 2004 you would think for the price it would be a 2012 DVD set at the very least. If I had a chance to do it again I would buy used!
2,beware of 3rd party sellers!,"I don't have issues with the product however I believe the product I bought was a bootleg copy....some of the disc playback ""froze"" and there was a duplicate disc. Bad for me, I should have played the discs when I first bought them. By the time I realized the problem, it was too late to return the product.Just purchased P90x from Beach Body via Amazon.com.....totally happy with the product!"
1,Order never received,This item was purchased on 3/7/10. We have still not received it and have been provided with no explanation.
1,Are you kidding?,"I purchased the P90X system to get in great physical shape. To be perfectly honest, I have no idea if it works or not. First,Tony Horton is completely obnoxious. He is SO into his own physical shape that his arrogance makes the videos virtually unwatchable. If he says ""Bring it"" one more time-I'm going to throw up. I hope he doesn't think he coined that phrase. About 19 cheerleader movies beat him to it. Second, you practically need a home gym to complete the program successfully. You have to have weights and a pull up bar. Not to mention, a gym mat and those useless resistance bands that you can get customer service on the phone to help you assemble plus there are no directions. I purchased Insanity and I LOVE it! You get toned but with your own body weight as resistance so you don't need any equipment. The cardio workout is unlike anything I've ever experienced. I'm putting my P90X system on EBAY where it belongs."
1,Awful,The problem with this workout is you have to have the house to accommodate the pull up bar..high ceilings needed. Also Tony Horton is annoying and the music is awful. The DVD holder was ripped as well.
1,A GYM Is Required For P90X,"Your suppose to be able to do this at your house but somehow P90X failed to mention the equipment required until you start. The first disc is the worst because you need different size free weights or bands and a pull up bar! you may as well be at a gym. Instead of supplying the basics for $150 they give you a lame food program of expensive foods you can buy and cant stop mentioning how you need there fitness supplements, what a joke. The disc don't work on my laptop and has problems playing on the Bose system we have. I was gonna buy insanity workout instead but realized that there by the same beach body company that has no quality in there products. So since I have already paid for there crappy made burned DVDs once I'm gonna get someone to burned copies of insanity just to get my moneys worth. This program is not worth the money because you can find lots of people trying to get rid of there P90X mistake online for cheap."
1,WARNING - P90X Logo causes burn in on plasma TV's,I rated this product low because I have burn in on my TV because of this and I've only paused the program for several minutes at a time so I've never left it on a static image for more than 5-10 minutes. The problem is the timer on the workout video is on your screen for the entire workout of an hour. I'm running a anti image retention tool now and it will not remove. This is a brand new Panasonic 60 inch Plasma that was manufactured 9/2011 so it's one of the latest generations of plasma. I aslo did proper burn in on my TV of over 100 hours. The model is a Panasonic VIERA TC-P60GT30 60-Inch 1080p 600 Hz 3D Plasma HDTV. Other than that it's definately a great workout and I noticed results fairly quickly. Just don't use it on a plasma.
3,good but missing,"Dvds came fast and in great condition. Brand new and sealed. However I never recieved the calendar, fitness guide, nutrition guide or workout log that was said to come with the dvds. If these are not to come as part of the set they should advertise dvds only."
5,P90X,"Got P90X 4 my son 4 Xmas. He's been using it 4 a wk. Has enjoy it. Very challenging. He's worked out using very heavy wts in the past & was looking 4 sumthing that wud give him gr8r flexibility. This product does that. He's been pleased with it. Also bc it's a home dvd, he doesn't need 2 run out 2 his gym 2 continue with his workouts. Recommend this 4 any1 looking 2 improve overall health, strength & flexibility while being challenged. Must also have strong self-motivation attributes.I bot this product via a vendor thru amazon.com. Product arrived w/in a wk. Tho it was labeled as ""used, like new,"" it was shrink wrapped & all of the original accompanying docs were included. I bot it @ a substantial discount. All products I've purchased thru amazon.com directly or via any of their vendors have arrived timely & in gr8 condition."
1,Not what I expected.,"I got the series but it was only a burned copy. Not the real deal. No workout book, no diet book, complete rip-off."
5,This product is legit,"Started using this product this week and am completely sore in places that haven't been sore in 15 years. The workouts are excellent and difficult but not impossible if you are in decent shape. I have been going to the gym for a long time and had been so bored with my routines. I wanted a way to increase my flexibility and strength (not just the appearence of strength). I would strongly recommend this product to anyone that has hit a plateau and needs to get off. Tony does a good job of keeping it interesting, at times I feel like I am being trained by Ace Ventura.Worth every penny."
5,Great workout but you must be committed,"As I regular jogger, I wanted to incorporate something to work on my upper body. I decided to try P90X. In some ways I got more than I bargained for, I have found that my running has dropped off quite a bit since starting the program, but I think my overall fitness level has improved. This program gives you a complete workout from head to toe. If you follow it you will get results, but you will need to commit to at least 1.5 hrs per day/ 6 days a week. The workouts have a lot of variety and are challenging so I have never felt bored. I am half way through the 90 days and I can see and feel the results. Even though the workouts are challenging, Tony Horton points out alternate techniques and advice on when to take extra breaks so that you can gradually work you way into completing the workouts. Overall a great program."
5,Excellent product,"I have never been able to lose weight by going to the gym. P90X, however, has found a great balance of workouts that make the pounds fall off! I lost several pounds in my first week, and I continue to feel better and stronger."
3,Great product other than time needed,"I bought this workout in order to stop paying for a gym membership but as i began using it i realized just how much time i would need to invest in doing this workout, as some of the exercises are well over an hour long. I'm not a hardcore lifter but i do like to workout around half an hour per day and the P90X was just more time than I could invest into a workout.On the positive note, they are awesome workouts and highly recommended if you have the time to do each workout in its entirety."
5,GREAT!,The DVDs arrived without a scratch. The booklets outlined exactly what I needed and it is a very easy workout to follow.
2,A lot of work and other program offers better results,"There's nothing magic about P90x. It's mostly just a ton of movement and volume. Working out 60-90 minutes a day six days a week is quite a commitment and while I'm sure those who have devoted the time and effort to it have seen great results, you can train your body much more efficiently through a well-designed strength training program that takes 45-60 minutes three times a week. I highly recommend Mark Rippetoe's Starting Strength over P90x. You'll build strength, reduce your body fat percentage, you'll be less exhausted and have more free time."
4,Bring It!,"I bought this for my BF, though he hasnt used it yet, I have been following the fitness plan and it works! The diet I cannot follow to the letter because I need to eat gluten free.You need hand weights, bands, a pull up bar, a polymetrics mat, a bar stool, and a chair or bench.I give it 4 stars because the sound does not work on some of the DVDs."
5,Extreme Fitness that you can bring with you,"My favorite thing about this workout is that it is portable, you only need the DVDs a couple resistance bands and the pullup bar which can easily fit into a suitcase or carry on. I visited with family this summer and did not have to stop my routine."
5,re-invent yourself,"I'm 56 and needed to prepare with Tony's ""Bring It"" workout which I loved and have recommended to friends. After 9 weeks of the book I finally jumped in. I bought P90X for my 23 year old son in the Navy and one for myself. We talk at least once a week to compare our pain and progress. I love it. In six weeks of P90X I feel much stronger and have improved dramatically. I stongly recommend it IF you're ready. Do the fit test on line before buying it and if you're not quite there get Tony Horton's book ""Bring It"" to prepare."
2,Scratched DVD's,I bought the 13 DVD package of P90X in like new condition. While watching the Intro DVD for the first time it started skipping and freezing. I then put in the next DVD to see if it had the same problems and it did. After about 30 minutes through it is start skipping and freezing..
1,vendor will not fix bad disc,"I orederd the whole kit - I had two of the same disc , finally got ""jeff"" who sent the one I was missing , but it dosent work correctly and now I cant get them to respond or fix the problem after LOTS of call and Emails ... Wish I had paid a little more at the official site and gotten it correct the first time ... BEWARE!!"
3,Too xtreme for beginners,This is not for beginners. If you are more than 10 pounds overweight and do not exercise regularly this will set you back rather than help you. You will be in xtreme physical pain. I found that I should first loose weight and get fit doing cardio in order to be able to do this workout which will probably work because it is really xtreme.
2,not so happy,I received the dvd's and more than half of them did not work and after they got replaced some of them still did not work. So I am not happy with the purchase. I was told the dvds were brand new and they were not. So now I am going to send them back for a refund and i have to buy them somewhere else. I feel like it was all a waste of time.
4,good training but annoying Tony,"This is definitely an excellent workout.But, Tony is VERY annoying. he talks too much in between sets. He models the exercises well, but once you've got the hang of each DVD, you don't want to hear him talk and make annoying comments. Also, he wastes too much time between sets with the talking and redundant instruction.It's too bad he didn't make an instruction DVD separately, then just made straight workouts with no instruction on the other DVD.s"
3,P90X Delivers!,"The workouts are great. It definitely takes a commitment but even only 5 weeks into it, I can see great improvements in strength and appearance! The downside is that the quality of the DVDs are not good. Since I didn't buy direct from the Beachbody site, I don't know if this is not an ""official"" copy-although the packaging was as described and sealed."
2,great work-out - bad DVD's,several of the DVD's in the workout were very out of balance- I had to put weight on top of my player to keep it from skipping. I tried them in my computer and got the same results. Usually with some patience i can get them to play all the way through but not always.
5,Best Workout,If you are really sick of being out of shape then P90X is the answer. This is the best at home workout that I have ever done. I have been doing P90X for the last four months and have lost almost forty pounds! I love how straight foward it is. You have to work hard and eat right and you will get in shape. I have recommended this to my friends and family. The bottom line is if you put the time and effort in you will see the results.
4,It is as good as the effort you put into it.,"P90X is a good exercise routine. However, it does require tremendous effort and assumes you are in good shape before you start."
1,P90X - New or Used?,"I chose to spend the extra money for a new version of P90X instead of a cheaper used product. I started the weekly workout routine and found myself loving P90X. During one of my workouts, the DVD stopped midway - it was pretty badly scratched and cannot be fixed. All I did was remove it from the case and put it in the player. This also happened earlier during a workout with a different DVD, but a good cleaning fixed it. It's apparent I recieved a USED product. The success of P90X is following the DVD's in sequence. Because I waited a couple weeks to start the program after receiving it in the mail, my option to return the product for a full refund expired three days ago."
4,Great Strength Training Work out,"I chose this fitness program due to all the hype about it and a desire for the kind of results I had seen some people have. It works, but it is not magic, much sweat and my times of wanting to quit will occur before changes are made. This program taught me that I don't really like slow paced, long strength training work outs, but really love fast paced cardio and Plyo workouts. Since discovering this, I have moved on to Turbo-Fire, but what I learned from P90X helped me to jump right into Turbo-Fire fairly easily. I am still proud of some of the exercises I am able to accomplish now due to P90X. My body results from P90X also helped me see that exercising is not just about looking good (though that is part of it), but also about being able to MOVE! I make can keep up with my elementary and middle school students and can even pass some of them in physical ability. That would never have been said before this program."
2,dvds defective,"several dvds in the package were defective, and i haven't received the replacement as promised."
4,"Excelent, but...","I only have a couple of the CD's, and I am enjoying those. My two main negative issues are that they are long and that I would have liked to have had it explained exactly what muscles each exercise is affecting. My main compliments are that on the CD's I have various ways to do an excercise is shown and that a woman is included in all workouts."
5,Completly satified,"This purchase was great. Fast delivery, mint condition - everything it promises. Couldn't have asked for anything better."
5,Best product ever,"If you are serious about working out and loosing weight, or bulk up or tone up. This one is for you, just do it!"
5,Great Product,This is a great product and exactly what I was looking for. Product arrived quickly and was just as described. My husband and I love it!
2,not happy,"The P90X that I purchased did not come with a fitness guide, nutrition guide and etc, as stated it would have 13 DVDs only came with 12 I did not getwhat I was promised. Based on what I have seen thus far I will not be purchasing anything from Amazon.com/jaci store in future. I have sent an e-mail trying to return and have yet to get a response."
4,Good Workout,I bought this for my son (at his request). He is a football player (lineman) and finds the videos challenging. He also plays college rugby. He likes the variety of exercises in the videos. So far he has lost 10 lbs in 2 weeks. He really enjoys the series.
4,"best workout, average material quality","VERY GOOD WORKOUT! been at it over 90 days then bought the workout for myself. only wish at this price the quality of the books was better. the menus and workout book spine will crack soon, and then the pages will fall out. but great workout, you will see results."
5,Life-Changing,"I got the product amazingly quick, firstly. My boyfriend and I have been at it for a month and we're both seeing DRAMATIC results!! Amazing seller, amazing product. AMAZING!P90X Extreme Home Fitness Workout Program - 13 DVDs, Nutrition Guide, Exercise Planner"
3,p90x,the dvd's are great but it did not come with the exercise planner or nutrition guide. fairly disappointed that it didnt come with those.
3,Used P90X DVDs,"I purchased used P90X DVDs from the seller Valgur. I had previously borrowed these workout videos and enjoyed the workouts, so I decided to buy them from myself. The used DVDs were advertised as all playable. However, when I received the 10 DVD set, one of the DVDs was missing and had been replaced with a duplicate of another. Also, one of the DVDs, which is a 15 minute abdominal workout, stopped 8 times while it was playing. I contacted the seller Valgur, and the missing DVD was replaced along with the non-functional DVD. However, the replacement DVD for the one that stopped 8 times during the playing of it, was not any better and stopped 5 times during the playing of it."
3,"Too advanced, too time consuming for me.","The program appears to work with time, however in my particular situation, i cannot give it the time it needs."
2,"Tricked, and never responded to...","The only reason this seller is getting 2 stars is for fast shippment, The CDS barely play (they were sent scrateched) and there was not any guides for the program as listed in the title!"
2,"Effective, but too extreme to stick to","I got this for post-pregnancy shape up. I had stayed active thru my pregnancy, working out several times a week. I tried this program to get back to pre-pregnancy shape & within 4 days had hurt my shoulder. (it does say at the beginning of the program if you have any shoulder issues NOT to use this) It is very heavy into the upper body work with the push-ups, pull-ups, etc. I can no longer do the workouts and am stuck with this expensive program now. Besides that problem, 90 minutes a day is just too much for anyone with a family or house to take care of.I hear Insanity is a much more do-able program."
2,P90X,"Did not receive the calendar, workout log, fitness guide, or nutrition guide. A little disappointing considering you have to follow those guides with the workout."
5,Amazing!!,This product is amazing! I'm already big into fitness and weight training and I thought this would be a great way to keep pushing myself. After the first workout I was so sore I had to take a day off! This video course will beat you into shape!
3,"Awesome workout, horrible product.","I actually bought the DVDs from a seller on ebay. Completely legit, buy it now, brand new in the packaging. The workout itself is fantastic. I feel great, my muscles ache in a good way, and my clothes are starting to fit better. I have only had the series for a week. The whole program is a great program. However, the quality of the physical DVD and the video is garbage. With the exception of the first DVD, all of my other DVDs skip, pause, black out, wobble, etc. Before buying the series, I read other reviews with similar complaints, hence why I chose to buy it for 80.00 off of ebay. The only thing that is saving it, is so far all the technical difficulties have not messed up the actual workout enough to really make a negative difference. That being said, this workout is worth the money. I have exercised before and this makes me sweat quicker then any workout I have ever done."
2,Half-baked,"The product is good, the person(s) I purchased this from, not so good, came with nothing pictured, just cd's. Big disappointment."
2,Not for a Newby,"Very difficult not for people just starting out. Not for people with joint or back issues, lots of floor work. Not very fun boot camp militaristic style workout. I'm sure its effective if you can suffer through the boredom. Not for me at all and not worth the money. Way to much hype ... I will stick with The Firm and Yoga!"
5,Amazing workout,"I was originally turned off of the P90X with it being advertised via infomercials, but I'm glad I took a chance on it. Workouts are tough and unless you're all ready in decent shape you'll not likely make it all the way through them at first, but it's ok. Pause and pace yourself and over time you'll develop strength and stamina.Convenient to do at home on your own schedule. Highly recommended."
5,Bring It Everyday!,"P90X is phenomenal. I absolutely love it, and a big thanks to Amazon.com for having it in their arsenal. I've lost 11 lbs. in two weeks so far, and I ""Bring It"" everyday. The package came with everything you need, minus a pull-up bar, but you can easily pick that up at any local sports-shop. P90X has a great community behind it and it's not some 5-minute-a-day scam, it's completely real. I love it, love it, love it!!! I recommend going to [...] f you are new to P90X, it will help pressing play everyday be much easier.Thanks again, Amazon!BigDave"
4,Pretty Fun!,"I had to take a break from gymnastics and I wanted to keep in shape,so if I had extra time I would do one of the DVD workouts. I think that overall they are pretty fun. They aren't super challenging but I think if your someone who isn't fit that they would be. We would do 200 to 300 of everything in gymnastics and I thought that this workout was very easy. After I hadn't worked out or done gymnastics for about 1.5 years I found this workout to become medium ""challenge-ness"", but still not very hard.But i do enoy them!"
3,P90 X,"This product was o.k. but I wonder if these P90X videos are the original or copies. It was advertised that the sets come with a Calender, Fitness Guide, Nutrition Guide, and workout log, but only the videos arrived. Then the seller later on e-mailed me the other information as if I really wanted to print out tons of papers. I was not 100% pleased, so I settled for just the videos."
2,p90x,"I was really excepting something great. ""Bring It"" is what he says a the beginning of every video. I brought it and thought it was not enough. I've been doing Jillian Michaels dvds since January and thought that I wanted to get a harder workout. Well I think Jillian has p90x beat. I'm going to do the whole 90 days maybe I will change my mind after the outcome. I just feel like I need more cardio. I think p90x does not have enough cardio to shed fat. I paid the money for it so I hope it pays off!"
1,Unless you're an Olympic athlete - save your money,"If you are able to do multiple 10-pull-up sets, kick box professionally and act as a yoga master, then this is the workout for you. If not, save your money. The physically fit won't be able to do most of it - even after several months. Very little time is spent demonstrating a move before launching into a 15 or 30 rep set (in double time). You'll spend most of your time (at least an hour for each workout) staring at the TV trying to figure out what they are doing. I've never hated a workout more."
5,Amazing Workout!,"I am well-known as a gym rat! However, in the winter, I do enjoy a CHALLENGING workout at home. These 13 workouts (plus two bonus workouts) keep things fresh and new even to me, one who gets bored easily! The program has three levels, so I can work within this set for 9 months, and plan to! I am a fan of Tony Horton, and this p90x does not disappoint!"
5,Great Product,"I received the product within 4 days! Once I got it and started using it, I have started seeing results after 2 weeks. Thats way faster than all the months of running I had done in the past! Great sell!"
5,The X Factor,"P90X is the first workout series I've purchased on DVD, and I'll never need another. IT IS INTENSE. The equipment requirements are minimal - A pull-up bar and dumbells or bands - so it is easy to travel with or do on the run. Be ready to dedicate at least 1 hour to each workout. The weight lifting aspects are awesome and not repetitive, the cardio and stretching DVDs are fun yet challenging, and anyone who thinks yoga is for wimps has not done YOGA X, the most demanding disc in the set. Highly recommended for those who are athletes but aren't getting the results they are hoping for... if you stick with this, YOU WILL SEE RESULTS."
3,P90X Extreme Home Fitness Workout,The product was received within a few days of the order and the shipment was complete. UI have not attempted to use the program yet. BB
2,Not what I expected,"At the beginning of the summer I made a commitment: I would work my way through the P90X DVD set that so many people have praised.Now that I'm finished, overall, I have to say that I found it a disappointment: the plot was repetitive, the dialogue was unconvincing, I never got a sense of any kind of character arc, and they needed a ton of ""padding"" to stretch this story to 12 DVDs -- they easily could have told it in 2 hours (1 disc). With a name like P90X, I expected a taut, futuristic, military techno-thriller; instead, it centered around a guy in a room encouraging people to dance like him -- not very interesting.Furthermore, the setting never changed: if you're going to confine the action to one set, next time consider doing it as a *play* instead of a TV mini series."
1,Disappointed in Amazon P90X,"I am disappointed. I ordered this product for my daughter for her birthday. The first time she tried using it, several of the CDs were scratched and unusable. It looked like the package was a used one. Now she will have to hassle with what to do, whether to return, and if she does return, will she just get another one of the same?"
2,fake,i watched 2 unboxings on you tube and they had all the booklets and nutrition plans and when i got my package it only had the dvds and none of the guides.
3,I lost 20 lbs doing this and can now do pullups.,"It's a good training program if you want to look lean but if you want to bulk up like me look elsewhere. On the plus side, it made me strong enough to do pullups and I learned I'm stronger than the average person because of this but still want to bench 250 one day.Anywho great program. I started working out in 2010. I was 230 and knew I wouldn't be able to live with myself as a fatass. I started lifting, running and working out 6 times a week. Ate healthy, drank tons of water and in 3 months was down to 195. After P90X I was down to 175 and need to bulk up now. Great program none the less just get lots of protein when doing it."
5,'LIKE NEW' = NEW!!,O.K so I haven't played the DVD's yet but just wanted to share that I took a RISK bought a USED set from builderfrog for cheaper and it is NEW!Go for the USED ones peeps!
5,Used to spend 3 hours at the gym....not anymore!!,"I have been going to the gym for 15 years. I read all of the fitness magazines, so I stayed pretty up to date with the latest and greatest. I am knowledgeable when it comes to working out and eating right. Somehow I always managed to stay around the same weight. Until I did P90X. I didn't even follow the food plan and I still lost 20 pounds. I am looking forward to P90X2 that comes out soon!"
5,P90X Kicks Major Tail!!!!,All I need to say is that P90x can work wonders for you. I just started it and can actually see slight changes in my body and increased energy. Not easy but if you want to make gains you have to follow it and try as hard as you can! Tony Horton rocks!
5,"Kicks your butt, but works really fast!","Length:: 2:58 MinsIf this guy can see noticeable results in just 5 weeks, then so can you."
3,P90X,"This is a decent fitness program, but only if you want to exercise 60 to 90 minutes every single day."
1,Poor Quality DVD's,"The only reason why I still have this product is because of Amazon's incredible customer service. I would rather review that than these cheap a--s DVD's Beach Body sells you. I am not sure why Amazon still sells them, they must create a huge headache for them. In any event, I could not give this item a better review, because some of this discs did not even work right out of the packaging. Many of the DVD's would not work after a few uses. I have tried everything to make them work, but no luck. Getting ready to send second set back to Amazon."
3,Great workout however very time consuming,I feel like this is a great workout a great system it really keeps you on track however each workout is very lengthy please make sure you look at the time commitment of each DVD before you purchase this product.
4,Would start out at 1/2 hour,"The workouts kick my butt, I started out with a 1/2 hour for the first couple of weeks so I would be able to move at work the next day. I was able to do the whole thing pretty quickly. Not sure if I will really look like them unless I really cut a lot of calories from my diet, but I guess that's the reality of getting in shape. It's harder in the winter, I like to work out more, but you can only eat so much salad in the winter. The only thing is there seems to be a lot of standing around in between segments, I'm used to old school videos that don't stop for the whole hour, so don't know if I'm losing anything there. Anyway, this is worth it for someone who doesn't want to or can't get to the gym."
4,"Good, but not perfect","Everything was in really good shape, except for one disc that stops before the end of the workout. Otherwise I was happy with the product."
3,Good workout-scratched disks,"The workouts themselves are great, and very challenging. As a former rower I really appreciate the ""bring it"" attitude of the videos. However, I would urge you not to buy them used. I bought some that were supposed to have been never used, and half of them are scratched and skip like crazy. Some of the disks cut out before they are even halfway over. This is frustrating, considering how much money I spent on them."
4,My P90X Review,My P90X Experience So far have been A Good One. However I Should Let you guys Know that So far I haven't Lost Much Weight Doing P90x but I have seen Seen an Increase of muscle mass. My Body has more tone and more well defined than it ever been so far am only into my 4th week... Hope that by the end of the Program I See Full Results.
4,P90x,Was advertised as a complete set but the ab ripper disc was missing. Other than that it is a nice set with all the bells and whistles.
5,Loved it!,I have used this workout regime as have many of my friends and we have all received spectacular results! It grows with you and is very encouraging when you think you cannot do any more. I keeps you going and interested. Definitely worth the money!
2,Great workout,"I love the workout but had some issues with the package. It turns out I received booklets which were printed by a substandard printing company which P90X dropped and liquidated the merchandise which my seller bought. After explaining the problem of terribly misspelled words and grammar errors, the seller sent me new booklets which were great;however some of the DVD's were scratched when I opened them and freeze during play. Probably should have bought directly from the company; however I haven't contacted the seller about this problem."
5,Kick-Ass program 8-),"I bought this workout program because I wanted to get back in shape but didn't want to have to go to the gym or wait in line to use the gym equipment, as you do when you go to any gym most of the time.At first I was a little skeptical about it as to if it was really gona do anything that will be really challenging like they show in the commercial on TV, but after my 1st workout, I was really surprised and happy that I bought it.You do need to buy the pull up bar and some weight (or resistance band) to be able to do the program but that's an investment for life, I bought it 2 years ago and the program is still going strong, still challenges you.If there's one workout program you should buy, go for this one and you won't regret it, it's gona be tuf to keep up but ""No Pain No Gain"" and you'll feel so much better that you did."
2,Trouble getting replacement product,"One of the discs included in this package, the Kenpo X, is not a readable file and will not play. I contacted Beachbody to request a replacement disc, however they claim they are unable to handle this issue suggesting contact the seller that you purchased the package from. Which according to my Amazon receipt this product was ""sold by Beachbody"".Very frustrating, indeed."
3,too many extras,Too many adjuvants required. I didnt realise the system needed so many extras and the workouts are a bit long for me
3,Is this a real version?,"The P90X dvd's and booklets are ok for the most part. There are spelling mistakes in the booklets though, which makes me think this is not a real version of P90X. One dvd skips and has some minor scratches on it. We can use the dvd, but it is obviously not new. Billed as a new product...I'm not sure the seller is on the up & up. Delivery was fine though, cannot make any unkind comments in that area."
3,Quick Way To Burn Out!!!,"I started exercising and eating better two months ago and the first of February I thought I was ready for this, that was absolutely not true. My sister, who is in fantastic shape warned me to proceed at my own comfortable pace or else I would get burnt out and unmotivated. Truer words have never been spoken and this product killed me. I have this back on the shelf for a while until I work up past working out three days a week for 30 minutes. I have lost 17 pounds since Christmas and I am doing very well but I was 215 pounds and did absolutely no exercise. Now I am working out three days a week and this thing wants me to work out everyday for an hour, YA RIGHT. I am sure it is a great system, but do not try to get ahead of yourself. I will update in a few months when I try this again."
3,NOT WORTH THE MONEY,If you are already on a decent exercise program don't waste your money haven't lost that much weight and the guy is very freaking annoying!!!!
3,Scrathed discs received,Ordered P90x and started doing the workouts. Workouts are tough but I am continuing on and seeing improvements. I have lost a few pounds and slowly increasing strength. Overall I feel the exercise program is good and if it is followed you will see results.The problem I have with P90X is the poor quality of the disks. I have 2 disks that are scratched significantly enough that the DVDs skip. One of the discs skips so badly that it completely cuts out some segments. I contacted Beachbody about getting a replacement disc. Beachbody refused to send me a replacement disc because I purchased from Amazon. Amazon cannot send out a single replacement disc. Amazon will allow me to return the whole workout program. I do not want to send back the whole program because I would have to stop the work outs. The most severely scratched disc in not used in the program until week 5. Beachbodys customer service is poor.
5,p90x extreme home fitness from the fox's den,The item I ordered arrived in perfect condition as specified by the description. The Fox's Den kept me up to date with my order by letting me know when it was packaged and shipped as well as including a tracking number. The process was made extremely simple and convenient and I couldn't be happier with my product. I would definitely recommend ordering from the Fox's Den as I plan to in the future.
5,Awesome,It was shipped and received in the time I was told. The product itself is great and was in excellent condition when received.
5,FANTASTIC,"Great seller, item was sent quick. even gave updates on products location, when its being sent and everything. great service. would definately recommend"
5,Fat is just melting off,"I'm 38, and have tried many ways to get in shape over the years.Having started P90x three weeks ago, I now know what a proper workout is *supposed* to feel like. And it hurts. In fact I haven't been able to complete a single workout yet, but as the review title indicates, the fat is already falling off of me. In fact at 2.5 lbs of weight-loss per week, I'm concerned that I may be losing too fast, so I'm adding some calories back to my daily diet to compensate.How many fat-loss programs have you tried where you said ""I think I'm losing weight too fast""? Amazing."
3,Halfway awesome,"I got this program expecting it to be amazing based on feedback from other users. What I didn't realize is that it's not something that is doable for most people. First of all, keep in mind that all the workouts take at least 1 hour and 20 minutes to complete as recommended (most are longer). This is incredibly difficult to accomplish 6 days per week for working people. Second, the weight/strength workouts are excellent and do produce results. It's the cardio/plyometrics/yoga workouts that could use some help. They are very repetitive, which, when translated into an hour and a half of workout, becomes boring fast.For me, it was worth the purchase if only for the strength training workouts. I will have to schedule carefully to make sure I have the time to complete entire routines. The others will collect dust."
5,Amazon P90X : Excellent!,"I was impressed with how quickly my package arrived. It was in mint condition. I have begun the work out routines and I am extremely satisfied. The whole work out package is intense, extreme, and quite manageable!"
4,P90X,"Although none of the product description said it DID NOT come with guides, I was disappointed that the product pictures show that it comes with all the guides."
5,Worth all the Hype,"I'm just starting the 2nd phase of this program and so far it has more than lived up to the hype. This isn't for sissies and the key is consistency - so if you start something only to lose interest, this isn't for you. I'm thrilled with the workouts and the changes I'm seeing in my physique. I don't really follow the nutrition plan as I already had a good diet, but I can see where it could be helpful to those who need more guidance. All in all, I'm a happy participant and can't wait to see how things continue to develop over the next 60 days."
4,Great gift!,I bought this for my husband as a Christmas gift. He has been faithfully following it for the past three weeks and has lost a few pounds and seen visible changes in his physique. The nutrition guide and fitness videos are a great combination. My only warning to those who are interested in buying this product would be to prepare to spend even more money on vitamins/supplements as well as the food necessary to keep up with the calories needed to support the vigorous exercise program.
2,Be Careful - Damaged DVD's,"The package that holds the DVD discs is not suitable for storing the optical media. It is made out of papers and causes scratches on the discs, and the discs will become unreadable after some use.I purchased mine from Beachbody fulfilled by Amazon.com. Out of 13 DVD's that I received, one disc was failing from the beginning. Another disc soon became the same after using a couple of times in and out of the designated DVD holder.If you are going to purchase this product, first thing you will need to do is to check all DVD's are readable. And next thing you need to do is getting a safe CD binder and storing the DVD's there.Please take a look at other 1-star or 2-star reviews, and see what their complaints are about - Damaged DVD's!!!The workout itself looks great, but it requires extra equipments such as pull-up bar and workout bands. If you have them already it's great. Otherwise, you will need to spend just little more money."
5,P90X Great Program with a partner,"My wife and I are on Week 4 of the program now and working out together has kept us on track. The benefits of this program are the variety of exercises that they throw at you and the constant reminders of proper form and motivation to do what you can. I have heard lots of people say that they gave up after starting this program. It is a lot of time to invest, but instead of watching TV shows, we are watching/and following these workouts and enjoying the results. I recommend for anyone that is at a moderate/high level of fitness."
4,Awesome,"The workout is intense, I was so sore the first week. It gets better and the results come quick, which for me is a great motivator."
4,p90x,"Good product, intense workouts , difficult diet. Results come fast to those who work hard and are dedicated. If you lack time or motivation though, this is not for you."
4,Great home workout!,"I bought this for my husband for Christmas. His New Years resolution is to get more fit, and this is the best thing out there to help him reach his goals. It's much more convenient than going to the gym or trying to run outside in the cold. We haven't used it much so far, so we like what we see!"
5,just as stated,"I received just what I orded, like new, still in plastic, with all books and discs. Received with in a few days, at a great price, very pleased with the order."
3,You need extra equipment - NOT JUST THE DVD's :-/,"Was very excited to get this. But, it is misleading on the commercials that you do not have to have weights, etc. to do the program. You DO need weights, pull-up bar, etc. to do a good majority of this program. I thought the whole idea of P90X was to stay in shape just using YOU. Oh well, I guess their marketers got one over on yet another customer."
2,Frustrating lack of technical instruction,"As someone who lacks coordination (I can't dance and am not good at sports), I found the lack of technical instruction in the videos to be quite frustrating.Prior to starting P90x, I exercised by running and lifting free weights (about 30 to 40 minutes a day). Each day of P90x is around an hour (some days are more) and I found myself having to constantly pause the DVD and rewind to try to understand how to do the moves.If you're coordinated and catch on quickly, I don't think it will be problem for you. However, for those of us that are clumsy and have difficulty coordinating movement, P90x may be quite frustrating.I ended up returning the set. I'm sure the workouts are great, but it was just taking too long to figure out how to do the movements."
3,almost perfect,"The fitness program itself is excellent. I started seeing results the first week. However, the calendar, nutrition guide and workout log were not included (as advertised). Also, My Kenpo disk is unreadable in one spot and I have to fast-forward through six minutes of workout or else the disk stops functioning altogether. I would really like to have had the nutrition guide!"
2,Not the complete set as advertised.,"There was no calender, fitness guide, nutrition guide, or workout log as advertised. All videos included though."
3,Good workout and Nutrition Guide but the presentation is over the top,"First the workout routines and nutrition guide make this worth the money. However the presentation of the material constant pushing of other products, poor commands from Tony, poor form from Tony, and Tony constantly referring the viewer as kids and peeps is nearly intolerable. Perhaps the most ridiculous thing is the constant X X X. If you need that type of brainwashing or motivation you will not stay with the program in the first place.Most of the workout cds give you the option to only receive cues but that is even poorly done. I found the only way I can use this product is to turn off the volume all together and listen to music. Personally I don't care about Tony or Dreya (a face only a mother could love), I don't care about their story, I want a good workout.I am on my 3rd 90 day program and have good results but again the presentation of the material is absurd!"
2,DVD 01 does not work,Wife got me this for Christmas. Very good program but disk 01 does not work. Called beachbody but since bought through Amazon they will not take care of it. Amazon will take a complete return but will not ship a replacement disk. I think you would be better off buying directly from beachbody.
2,Not convinced.,"I am pretty sure that the DVDs are copied because they only play in my PS3. All three of my other DVD players will not play them. The workouts are awesome, and the program is as advertised."
2,did not appear to be new,"When I received the item, the gromets that hold the DVD book together were loose and so the all of the sleeves were seperated. It was not packed very well and appeared to be used."
5,painfully wonderful,This program arrived and I got started on it right away... gosh am I sore. But in a really good way! The guy in the videos really keeps you motivated and keeps you feeling positive. Everyday is a different workout so the soreness moves around... LOL! I've lost weight already and am very pleased with this product.
5,Great investment,"This product is a great investment. The workouts are fun and challenging while offering a variety (for those like me that get bored easy, that's a great thing!). Best at home fitness video series."
4,55 year old male,A difficult program but one you can work up to.I find the cardio to be very exhausting and not a lot of fun.The strength programs are great and you will notice the transformation of your body to be rapid.After a month I am beginning to look damn good in the mirror.I probably go after it with 60% of total effort.My goal is to not get an injury.History of bad shoulders and don't want any flareups.I am pleased with the product as it will never get out dated.
5,AMAZING,"I have always enjoyed to be out doing things. Although I was fit I began to gain wieght. My push ups and sit ups werent doing anything. Enough I decided I need somthing that will work. After seeing an infomertial at a friends house I got it for my birthday. When I got this program it came in a neat organized case with every thing included. The workouts in this program are hard and difficult, and if your prone to injury this isnt your program. The p90x program also is very flexible dependening on your fittness level. Although, I didnt follow the diet program competly the program works non the less. If you buy this program and you bring it you will see results."
4,Late 50's and still working out!,"My wife and I are in our late 50's and in so-so shape. We started on P90X about 3 weeks ago and can tell a difference already. To be honest, there are some exercises on the DVD's we just can't do, but we're trying to do our own modified version of them to keep the flow of the workout going. We did not purchase this product with the intention of ""getting ripped"" but we really can see some definition in the short amount of time we've used it. What we read on a couple of other reviews was exactly right: you get out of it what you put into it. That's true of any fitness program. This is a great presentation overall with easy to understand instruction on the different exercises and great nutritional info included as well."
3,"Great product, not-so-great quality DVDs.","The P90X workout is awesome. I am just completing Block 1 (first 4 weeks) and I am following the program to the letter. Unfortunately, one of the DVDs in the set called Yoga X and I haven't been able to do it because the DVD would not play. I contacted customer service and after a delay, they sent me a Yoga DVD from some other exercise program NOT P90X. I have been substituting the Yoga day with another Yoga DVD I already had and I supposedly have one on the way but the program is pretty expensive and I would think they would do quality checks on their DVDs to ensure they play. In any event, my clothes are falling off me (only 20 more lbs to go) and I continue to wait for my P90X Yoga X DVD in the mail. Hopefully this time they sent the right one."
5,P90X is amazing!,"I've seen the infomercials for a couple of years now and it was time to give this product a try. I have tried Tae Bo, Pilates, Yoga, lifting, and running marathons and this is the fastest way I have been able to lose fat and get as defined muscle as I want. I love this product and I think everyone should get it!"
5,P90X,"I wanted to try P90X and had never really engaged in any sort of work-out routines. Personally, I was not looking to lose much weight, but just be more fit. The workouts are fun, but challenging. I couldn't do 1 pull up or more than a couple push ups when I started, so I was pretty out of shape even though I wasn't overweight. the workouts ARE doable, but you will be sore! I highly recommend it if you are serious about a new committment...it is about 1.5 hours 6 days/week. Even though it seems like a lot, I liked the fact that there was an 'end' to this workout program. You can then continue another round or maintain what you've done afterwards instead of starting to exercise and thinking ""I just have to do this forever now"". I highly recommend the program. P.S. we did the diet plan (as best we could) along with it (protein shakes, bars, recovery drink... the whole bit) and I would recommend that as well."
3,Do not buy if you have joint problems,"Great intense workout and it DOES work. However, I have knee issues and can not do any aerobic or leg workouts. My husband, who is in good shape, tore a wrist ligament doing this program and just had surgery to repair it. Additionally, a friend at work now has a shoulder injury for about a month from doing the program and she is good shape too. We are all in our late 30's to early 40's and not overwieght. The diet is tasty but is mainly a high protien/ low carb diet. And sorry Tony, you're cheese ball at times!If you have any joint issue do not spend the money. It is not easy to modify. Otherwise it is a fantastic workout. And get your own bar. The one P90 sells is not ergonomic to grasp... maybe thats what happened to my hubby."
5,Apparently you are never too old for this program,"I bought this program for my husband for his 65th birthday. He had just retired and I did not want him to end up sitting watching TV all day like his father did. He LOVES IT. We modify it and work out together every day. The first week we had to buy a large tube of Ben Gay and we head for the hot tub after our morning work out, but now as we finish week 5, we are doing so much better. We have increased the amount of weight we work with so there has to be muscle increase and we have lost pounds.My husband sets the alarm so we get up early. He never lets us miss our workout. Although I think Christmas Day will be an exception. The grandkids are not that patient. But then back to business. We LOVE Tony Horton. I have talked about P90X on Facebook and now our neighbors have bought it."
3,Beware,"I bought this DVD in February-GREAT WORKOUT. No complaints about content. HOWEVER, one of the DVDs did not work. Beachbody will NOT cover this product if purchased from AMAZON. They only offer customer support if purchased from them. I have been trying for 5 months to get a new DVD and Have been told multiple times that I should have bought it from them. They will not help you or even report the problem if you purchase it from AMAZOn."
4,"It works, but it can get boring","I've completed the routine and was very pleased with the results. Going through it again, however, became very boring. It sometimes becomes hard to stay focused with the routine. Dreya tends to get on my nerves, too. Plus, you have to consider that 4X/week you will need to set aside about 1.5 hours. As many have said, the yoga routine gets very boring. You wind up constantly looking at the clock. While I hate the yoga routine, I still do it because I noticed there are many moves that help you with the other routines. The abs routine is a killer, but as Tony says, ""I hate it, but I love it."" You notice yourself doing more and more each time until you can get through the entire routine without stopping. The Core routine is a killer, but you really feel a sense of accomplishment when you're done. You should be in some sort of shape, but I love how Tony just encourages you to do your best and forget the rest."
2,"Great Marketing, Not So Great Program","if you are looking for advanced workouts that can be done efficiently, this program in NOT for you.what I DISLIKE about:1. They waste alot of time, warminng up almost 15 ~ 20 min? each workout can be designed to 35 min easy. Too many breaks between workouts, I really dont' have time for all these.2. They are not doing anything special. All the routine are something you are familar with if you have done several type of workout routines to DVD or Exercise TV. ""Muscle confusion?"" My muscle has NOT been confused at all.3. The intensity of workout is not challeging enough unelss you add much more weight to your dumbells than you are used to, then again, with the added weight, any workout can be challening.Overall, it is pretty dissapointing."
2,Eventually Plateaued,"I have to update my review b/c another user didn't understand my previous one. So here goes...I bought this in 2009 and did some rounds from then to now. Although P90X aided (very little) in losing weight with a healthy diet, I eventually plateaued and couldn't lose any more weight.What really made me lose weight was just diet alone (portion control and healthier meals) and not P90X. What bothered me the most was how P90X didn't give me any muscle definition. After watching the infomercial numerous times, I was looking forward to looking toned and ripped. :( (which it didn't do)I spent so much money on the dvd set, (which skips and gives me problems) the pull up bar and countless dumbbells."
3,THE QUEEREST THING I HAVE EVER SEEN,"In the Ab Ripper X workout, there's a point in the workout where Tony Horton struts to the camera somewhat slowly and says, ""Ab... Ripper...X"" In a really creepy, unnerving voice.It is absolutely the queerest, most bone-chillingly obnoxious and weird moment I have ever seen in a workout video. It will give you the chills."
2,Not that great too fast paced,I tried this for a few days and its way too fast paced... then i tried jillian michaels and it was much easier. I am a little overweight and p90x is very hard. Dont waste your money....find another product btw you also dont have to buy there equipment u can get it at walmart. I personally dont like the YOGA on here I am not bendie. its LONG too about 60 minutes. I would say pass on it if u can. I also want to say i have a shin spint and lower back problems this would not be the DVD for you if you have any problems like that
4,P90X,"Shipped in a timely manner and upon receipt of the item, everything was in the condition it was promised to be. Very satisfied."
3,P90Extreeme Home Fitness,"Or\\\Program seemts to be what is advertised, but it was too extreme for my grandson. He is unable to keep up with the physcal gait. Perhaps a more basic program would be in order.Don Horton"
3,okay,"this isnt the greatest workout system for someone like me. i am young in shape and just need something to give me the extra umph to be the best soccer player i can be. for someone young and in shape and into sports i do not reccomend this. the only really good workout is plyometrics!! it is amazing!! and i cant say enough good things about it! but as a program in whole it is decent. for someone llooking to lose weight i would reccomend running, this isnt going to do it for you!"
4,p90x delivery,"The product is in great condition. The only issue is that the shipping took nearly a month because USPS ground was the selected method of transport. I was unaware of this because it wasn't clear while I was ordering, so I was a little perturbed that it took so long to arrive."
3,Solid program,I recently purchased the program and reviewed the DVDs. The simple truth is there is nothing new or innovative with the program. The goal is muscle fatigue or muscle failure. There are a number of less expensive products on the market which achieve the same results. The inference in the title and during the video demonstration is the program is designed for in home use which is misleading. The user will need a large room void of any furniture other than a TV and DVD player. If you need motivational support and/or encouragement I recommend the program. If you can push yourself then read a less expensive fitness book and exercise until muscle failure.
4,P90X arrived today,"I read the reviews covering bad product delivery. I received mine today. I had all materials listed as per the description. Sorry for the one's that stated their disks didn't work and they didn't get all of the manuals. I started off with day one workout today. Only did half way, as I am in a partial gout flareup. So stressing my knee isn't great for me right now. But I see where I can use some of this workout now, while I can and I can do the rest when I am not in flareup. For me, P90X might be more of a way to keep motivation in working out, in between attempting to get my gout under control. I know, it's stated that if you have any chronic issues, don't use it. I understand this and will never blame a product for pushing me into injury. You just must know your own limitations."
5,good program,"first month done, now into month 2. muscle confusion works, im sore as heck, and i lost weight and gained some musles already. also theres a diet you have to follow to.this program requires commitment on your part. keep pressing play....."
5,Wow!! Results!,"P90x is the real deal! The workouts are tough, but if you keep up with them, you WILL have the results you want!"
4,During the Craze,"I bought this product at the height of the P90X craze. I was happy with my purchase at the time; however, I was unable to do some of the CDs becuase I did not know you had to purchase equipment. I like Insanity better becuase you can do all the workouts without purchasing any additional equipment."
2,"Dangerous workouts, unrealistic recipes","I followed the P90x workouts for about two months before I injured my neck and had to stop. Several of my coworkers had similar experiences where they had shoulder injuries that caused them to stop. It is problematic to do weight training alone with only a video. It is easy to have poor form that makes you prone to injury.Also the recipe book that comes with the program is next to useless. Even if you are super commited, it is very difficult to follow. Many of the recipes are very involved. For instance, there is a whole section on making your own sauces.I'm not a big foodie, and I don't particularly like cooking. I would have been willing to follow simple recipes, but the book didn't fit my needs."
4,awesome workouts,"Yes, this kicks your butt. And that's the point. THe only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is becuz the workouts are abit too long for me."
2,Not what I was looking for,"The best thing about this book is the eval copy of Exchange 2003. The rest is architecture and concepts and not much on examples, real world senarios. Seems to me there's a lot of ""Exchange can do this and can do that ..."" but not much of ... ""here's how u do this in Exchange"". Not my cup of tea. Good reading for the geek that wants to understand how this all works ... and in time I will want to know that .. but not so good for those that want to get a good solution up and running. I'm bring it back and gonna buy MCSA/MCSE Self-Paced Training Kit (Exam 70-284): Implementing and Managing Microsoft Exchange Server 2003 ..."
2,There are better to be found,"I thought this book was pretty average. I know its not an exam prep book, and it certainly wasn't, but I didn't think it was much of an administrators guide either.I found myself getting contually frustrated with the theory, and not enough practice. Buy Unleashed, or go to winstructor.com and get their videos, both are much, much better than this."
5,An Epic Tragedy. One of the Best Books I Have Ever Read.,"The premise of the book has become so cliched that its fundamental truth has almost become obscured. Cocker uncovers in painstaking detail the results of European colonialism in four areas of the world. Without ever romanticizing the societies (the bloody nature of the Aztecs is particularly stressed) that are conquered, he paints a tragic picture that moved me to the point of tears more than once. A valuable antidote to apologists for European/Western Imperialism."
4,"Excellent,","The book shows in vivid detail how many groups who have developed a superiority of power/technology etc frequently use it in a most base and grasping manner, warping their own morality to justify it. Rather than the simplistic European/American(bad) vs nobel savage (good) conflict that some other reviewers took from it,it demonstrated the all universal human trait of brutality and genocide in the pursuit of plunder and greed. The readyness to which societies on the one hand professed education,morality etc descended to levels of cruelty that begars belief in clear and systematic and recurring patterns used to self justify it makes for an absorbing book."
1,PC BS,"Go elsewhere for a balanced scholarly account, this book is just an attempt to cash in on a false politically-correct warping of history. Not much good for anything."
2,Fit was wrong,"The concept for the product is good, but I think the sizing is off kilter. I wear Saucony Pro Grid Ride 2, size 7.5. According to the size chart, I need a size XS. When I got these, there was no way the STABILicers were going to fit over the shoe. Plus, it felt a little heavy. I decided to return them."
1,Not great,"These did not really work for me as my kiking boots seemed too wide to accomodate the cleats, and then they kept popping off while trekking."
3,Work great on sneakers and ice but nothing else,These are awesome on my running shoes and cross trainers. They work best on icy surfaces. I also tried them in my snow boots though and they don't work and they are not very helpful in thick snow.
1,These possibly could be a good quality product... but I won't even find out. The sizing is too messed up.,"I ordered a small of these. Supposedly they would fit size 7.5-9.5 womens shoe. Tried them on my size 8.5 women's running shoes. I can't get them on, they seem way too narrow and definitely too short. I tried them on some narrower sketcher shoes, still can't get them on. I tried to put them on my son's size 4 youth shoes. Still can't get them on, and they are still too short. Tried them on my son's size 12 toddler shoes. I still can't get the toes to even to all the way in. The rubber is too tight, and the sizing of the toes too small.I'm not going to bother with trying the next size up."
4,With there were an XL size,"These are great. I strap them on my shoes and have no fear of slip-sliding on ice. I also like the way the cleats are replaceable. I give it only four stars because the photos are deceiving. It shows the product on a high-top shoe boot. I wear size 10 and it was near impossible to get them on my boots. I managed, but if I were an 11, no way."
5,"""LABOR DAY"" READS LIKE A NOVEL!","Being a father and grandfather of ""the old school"" (who had no greatest fear than not getting his wife in time to the hospital ""when the time came""!), I didn't think that I would derive a great deal of pleasure reading that book upon which I stumbled quite fortuitously. To my pleasant surprise, though, nothing could have been further from the truth! Indeed, I thoroughly enjoyed ""LABOR DAY"". I sincerely think that Ann-Marie Giglio did a super job collecting and editing those stories that read like novels. Incidentally, this is also the opinion of my daughter and daughter-in-law (both mothers themselves) to whom I gave copies of the book."
5,"Wonderful, Inspiring..","I loved this book. As someone who is trying to get pregnant, and will hopefully soon be going throught the labor process, I can not read enough ""birth stories"" This book has a collection of 35 stories, most of them written from the laboring mothers point of view, but some are written from the husbands point of view. I plan to buy this book for every baby shower I'm invited to for the rest of my life. Any woman who is expecting will love this book. And for only [price], it's a great deal."
1,Terrible!,Lots of little stories from lots of different people. Nothing of value in the medical sense. No useful information for your experiences. This is a terrible book and not worth the money at all!
5,Lincoln's Commando,"Little has been written about U S Navy action during the Civil War. Lincoln's Commando addresses this very nicely. The exploits of Cdr Cushing deserve the recognition of history. Few, if any mention of Cushings service, can be found in any of our history books. A USN destroyer was named after him rightfully so."
3,Cables are great but case was not what expected,"The retractable cables are great. The case is not what I expected at all. I was looking for a case to keep my Ipod, cables, etc all together whether at home or on the go. This is not the case for that. It has molded foam in it to hold the cables in place. Otherwise, it is a good product."
2,"Wasted space, can't add other items","This case does not allow for carrying anything additional. The carved foam just about fills it, causing a real waste of space within the case. I bought it for air travel, hoping I could put everything for my ipod, including the ipod itself in it, but you can't add more than a maybe a CD in the single pocket opposite the cables.I'm not returning it since the cables are nice and compact and I needed the AC adapter. They will be convienent in whatever case I do end up using."
3,Good concept. Helps some.,Great concept and helped eliminate some of the sheet washing. Wish it were a little bigger. Our 5.5 year old moves around so much that sometimes he leaks beyond the pad. We've actually gone back to pull-ups for a while but still use the pad to prevent any leaks.
1,Where's the romance?,"If you want a how to on how to skip all romance and jump straight into the sack then this book is for you. It's also for you if you want to read about a weak willed ninny who doesn't even like her ex, says ""no"", but still is willing to romp at every opportunity. I always believed ""NO"" meant just that, but if you buy into this story it proves ""no"" means ""yes"" just because he wants it to. The characters jumped around from aggrivating to confused and never really developed an identity of their own. I enjoyed Rafe, it's sad this turned out to be such a loser."
5,An absolute must read for anyone in the financial services industry,"Mr Dellinger has done an absolutely spectacular job of explaining a complicated topic that has been throughly misunderstood by thousands of financial planners and consumers for years. He makes an extremely valid and well thought out case for why a variable immediate annuity should have a place in an individuals portfolio, especially if they are concerned about outliving their assets in retirement. This book should be the retirement income dictionary for planner community."
2,Cute not sturdy...,"After less than a month carrying this bag for school the seam by the handle (on top) has come undone. I don't think it's made to handle the load of a college student, although I only have one class right now! If you have more than 5lbs of books get something a little more sturdy.On the positive side, it's very cute and has a fair amount of room!"
5,solid tape measurer with great feature,"I've been installing laminate flooring in my basement and this tape measurer has gotten a lot of use. The markings are both sides of the tape are a cool feature, but more than that it's just a solid, sturdy, well made tape measurer. I have a few other tape measurers, but this is the one I always use. The tape is thick so it doesn't bend or fold easily when measuring long distances, it retracts like a mother, and the quick lock works well. If you're measuring things above your head, it's especially helpful, but even if you need to solid tape measurer that will last, pick one up."
4,What a great idea!,I've had this tape measure for a few years and it's been more then handy. The numbers on the underside prove useful in all sorts of circumstances and it's hard to remember using a tape without them. It has held up well to abuse and is still as solid as it was on day 1.
3,No fractions printed on the tape measure,"I just received these. I bought 4 for gifts and personal use. But now I am disappointed. The product pictures show that the fractions are printed on the tape measure. But none of the 4 tape measures that I received by ordering from this merchant actually have the fractions printed on them (on either side of the tape). The fractions are very helpful, especially for people who come from countries where the metric system is used. I wouldn't have bought these if I had known that there are no fractions printed on them. However, they do a very good job of overhead measurement. I sat on my sofa and was able to touch the 8' ceiling with the end of the tape without standing."
2,not durable,Not durable; mine rusted within months. It is true that I got wet one time but did not think that would have rusted it.
5,Reliable tape measure for the professional,"I have gotten so frustrated with split blades, broken springs, numbers rubbing off and ackward lock systems. This tape measure works !! Easy to read (no metric), very sturdy and reliable lock system, so versatile to be read at any side or edge, and so far the printed surface is durable while the spring has been consistant. I bought two (shop and truck) and will probably order more (I pitched 3 old ones after using these)."
3,overpriced and overrated,"There's not much in the book that isn't common sense, especially if you've ever donated to a nonprofit yourself.The price of the book is utterly ridiculous. I definitely wouldn't recommend paying for a new copy. See if you can find a used copy, and don't pay more than $35 for it. Better yet, borrow a copy--the owner is unlikely to miss it while it's away."
1,Not recommended,"Starring: Chloe, Dee, Jezebelle Bond, Danny Pape, Angela Davies, and Tony Tedeschi. 9 soft core scenes. 92 mininutes long. A rock band manager hires a nurse to keep a health condition of rock star in the band, then the story begins. Most of the time, the movie just shows off the softcore scenes, and the story doesn't advance much. Purchase not recommended."
4,shiloh sign,I love the sign but wish it were metal so I could put it outside. I'm sure all my friends who own Shilohs will want one too.
2,Disapointing,"I had to read this book for a class assignment. If you don't need to read it, I wouldn't recommend it. There were a lot of run-on sentences and a lot of stream of consciousness spots as well. Plus then ending was very weak. But, there are some spots where it is an interesting book to read. All in all I wouldn't recommend it to anyone."
1,A Literary Stain,"I don't know what Roth was trying to get at in this long and pointless novel, but it's obvious that whatever it was, he missed it by a country mile. Perhaps this novel is a sign of Roth's slowly encroaching senility. That would be the only valid excuse for a book as mediocre as this one."
3,Ripped off from Law & Order? Maybe a little.,"The core element of this story and even some of the conversations in it were done in an episode of Law and Order called Blood (11/19/97).However, it wasn't what I'd call a rip off really. Perhaps Herr Roth was inspired by the idea and wanted to see what else would come from a life of lies like this.Here's a discription of Blood (Caution: May spoil part of Book)The paternity of a black baby given up for adoption by a white mother might provide a clue to her murderer, but it also unearths some long, buried family secrets that the baby's father was desperately trying to hide."
1,Do Not Read This Book,"I am the easiest critic in the world. I like almost any book I read, but this is a rare exception. This book dragged on and on with no real point. The big ""secret"" is revealed at the beginning of the book and the story dies after that. Save yourself the money and find a better book to read."
3,"Flawed, but still a great read.","As I write this, there are over 180 reviews of this book on Amazon. As I read through them I am struck by the detailed descriptions of how poorly written it is, and am subsequently surprised that I generally agree with many of the critics and their accusations. Yet I enjoyed reading it. Roth is supremely talented in his use of the language, and keenly aware of the limits of human passion. His outrage frightens, his contempt stings, his story captivates. One thing that stays with me is his ability to portray convincingly the inner workings and motivations of characters with disparate attitudes. OK, so he needs a better editor... still, I laughed and sweated through much of the book. If you are new to Roth's works I recommend you start with something else- perhaps American Pastoral. But if you have enjoyed several of Roth's books I think you will enjoy this one as well despite its flaws."
3,Can an old white guy really understand women?,"While I don't dispute that this is an interesting (if not particularly original) book, it's astounding to me that after so many years as an author Roth is still unable to write well about women. The dreaded Professor Roux is awfully one-dimensional and contrived - she seemed to be based upon someone in Roth's own past with whom he is still angry. And the real reason that Roux is so mean and miserable? She's lonely and just needs a good older man like Phillip Roth (oops, I mean Coleman Silk). Others have argued that the characterization of Faunia Farley is thoughtful and deep: yet this ""depth"" stems more from the fact that Roth rarely allows her to say anything than from any empathetic writing on his part. Roth's use of strong words to describe sexual situations - is he trying to shock us? To startle us? is a distraction. This book would have benefitted from a good editor (preferably a woman)."
1,More schtick from Roth,"Philip Roth is the Woody Allen of American literature. He's found his public's hot buttons & pushes them incessantly with tiresome adolescent obsessiveness:...men recounting their erections, lusty bad-mouthed (usually angry) women, topical commentary (Clinton & Lewinsky here) & off-the-press contextuality (campus & race politics in this case). His characters seem totally manufactured to meet the ends of the book & his style is a thick brocade of almost total impenetrability. On the other hand, this is America & if your product sells, hey, you're a success!"
2,Creaky plot,"A Human Stain is about racially sensitivity taken to absurds never seen in real life mixed up with a book about passing as white, spiced up with geriatric sex, Viagra, Monica Lewinsky, a crazy Vietnam vet, and two dead kids, mixed thoroughly with a heavy theme of the sacrifices caused by living a lie/trying to escape your past (not really the same thing, but maybe if you take a screwy look). I think Roth took every idea he had and threw them up against the wall, and lord amercy they all stuck. Good thing he writes a lot. We can go read his good stuff and try to forget this mess."
5,Excellent,The words flow like a stream catching you up in the flow. Wonderfully descriptive. I ate it like a good meal. Shades of Thomas!
4,Characters to remember,"The two main characters are people you'll remember. Fiction rarely manages to present people who are as real as these characters are, but still interesting, flawed of course, but that much more memorable because of it. Plot is weaved into characterization very well, and the settings work too. This is a rich novel that makes you think and sticks with you afterwards."
3,A Student on Stain,"There is no reason to hate this book, but there is no reason to love it either. Forget the occational sex scene (and you most likely will) and all that's left is Roth's characteristic judgement-at-a-distance writing style. Human Stain is relevant, although not poignant."
3,racial identity placed under the microscope...,"'The Human Stain' is a somewhat difficult book to review. It attempts to dig into the American pysche on race identification and discrimination by presenting a somewhat hard to believe story of a professor scandalized by (allegedly) racial remarks made in class. The author has seemingly taken on too broad of a subject, then attempts to tie it together with some very over-cooked prose ... at times it gets very pretentious. Yet Philip Roth succeeds with characterizations which are most memorable; the book does have its moments.I suppose my biggest disappointment with 'The Human Stain' is when it is compared to vastly superior works by the likes of James Baldwin. The author doesn't quite get the sense of ... (despair? frustration?) of being an African-American in post-war America. He throws in convoluted sentences, has his characters shrieking in angst, and it all just gets out of control.Bottom line: a complex yet unsatisfying book. Not recommended."
2,"Good ingredients, bad result","Sounds like a great mix, based on a novel by Philip Roth. Mixed race ex-boxer prof (Hopkins) marries out into white community. Pretends he is Jewish. In later life meets screwed up younger white woman (Kidman) with whom he vainly tries to expunge his past. It takes more than eggs to make an omelette, however, and Robert Benton's dreary direction ruins any prospect of a good film. Worst part, Nathan Zuckerman - what on earth was the point of this character - (Gary Sinise). The scene in which Hopkins and Sinise try to dance the slow foxtrot together is one of the daftest and most pointless I have seen in any movie. Best character Ed Harris (Lester Farley) though badly underwritten - why had his relationship with Kidman broken down ? Because he was nuts or she had driven him nuts. She would have me."
1,Not the book for me!,"Some people may like this book, but I couldn't get into it.The reviews were great, but I didn't get past the first 50 pages!"
2,A beater defends a cheater.,"After the second reference to the Clint-on s-e-x scandal, I put the book down. I have better things to do than be subjected to a real life wife beater defending the philandering behavior of a wife cheater. Hey that rhymes. Now I can be a rapper."
2,Put it down after the first couple pages of whining,"I bought this book b/c it made the NYT Book Review list of top novels, but the author began the novel whining - that's the only way to describe it, whining - that slick willie was treated oh so unfairly by we churchgoing middle-America do-gooders (I am a Southern moderate atheist who despises the Clintons for what they are - common trash) But it isn't the politics, per se, that that turned me away from the novel, I just find it hard to believe that such temporal political commentary can be a prelude to a work of any depth, or even a mark of a serious novelist, for that matter. And so I don't want to waste my time with it. If he wants to sermonize he should get the NYT or someone else to publish a column and not insult me by injecting his whining into what can only dubiously be termed 'a novel'."
3,Not the best but powerful moments,"Hi, this book is not among Roth's best. It could be at least 100 pages shorter. The antistablishment lethany goes on and on in certain parts (mostly related to some character inner thoughts) even long after the reder has gotten the point. The french lady, Coleman's former colleague, is unnecesary. Maybe it was just some kind of payback from Roth to some aquaintance(?). Having said that the high peaks in this book, certain scenes, dialogues, inner thoughts are among Roth's finest and of an unsurpassed intensity. Is worth reading, but be prepared for some long boring verborreic sections."
5,A thought-provoking work of fiction and nothing else!,"Most of the other reviews pretty much nailed this extraordinary novel because the reviewers understand that this is a work of fiction, so I don't have anything else to add about The Human Stain itself. Less than useful is the disjointed screed of one individual who seems to have an ax to grind about racial definitions, not only here, but in other reviews on Amazon. I urge those who might be put off by this reviewer to read his or her other ""editorials"" before you decide not to read The Human Stain. I think you'll get what I'm talking about."
4,The Chronicler,"Philip Roth is certainly one of the greatest, if not the greatest, living American literary figure.In The Human Stain, Roth relates a story that touches on many themes: accepting your past (and coming to grips with it), relationships (both filial and erotic), race relations, and many others that contribute to a great work of fiction.Roth's characters are fully developed and realistic, and his imagination obviously knows no bounds. He runs the gamut of players in the novel, from an educated, discraced professor, to a disgruntled Vietman veteran, to an illiterate young janitor.Why not the fifth star? First, though the plot is well concieved, some may find it poorly executed. The setting of the novel often shifts from present to past, which makes for difficult reading. Also, Roth writes quite often in a stream-of-consciousness manner, and subsequently digresses quite often. This, especially, can make for lulls in the book, and is the reason many people I know have not enjoyed it."
1,A Big Disapointment,"I was really looking forward to this book, based on the polt description and word of mouth about the author. I couldn't even finish it! After the first 30 pages, I grew tired of plodding through dialog that no real person would ever utter, spoken by characters with whom I wouldn't want to spend five minutes! At times it seemed like the book was just a vehicle for the author to spew his extreme political views, and I did not appreciate the lecturing!"
5,A full meal of a novel,I was in the hands of a true master throughout this great book. Insightful and rewarding.
1,Ugh,Loved early Roth (Goodbye Columbus etc.) but he has been going straight downhill for several years. This misshapen thing is terrible -- not least because of the cardboard cutout cliche Vietnam veteran character. A beginning writer would cringe at stooping so low; from one of America's previously better novelists it is appalling. Not many groups left to pick on and be PC -- Nam vets and rednecks are the only two that come to mind -- but this think is fatally flawed and ugly.
2,eternal conflicts presented as poor literature,"I keep hoping that Roth would write a better novel. His characters are potentially interesting people and his themes are universal. We don't get a developed picture of the protaginist Coleman, a retired university professor, with an interesting past and many conflicts. He is typically a Roth Characer whose ego has problems dealing with his libido and conscience. He is always angry not able to find any internal integration. This is also true of the other characters who are very two dinensional and always predictible. They incluse his lover, his lawyer, his frustrated female detractor and others. I'm sorry about this as I can remember laughing with Portnoy many years ago. For me Roth is prolific, tells complicated stories but is a middle of the road author."
4,Deeply relevant,"In short, but expansive descriptions, Roth takes us inside the psyche of his characters and reveals in the process much about our American selves.Read it if you dare."
4,Fascinating and well-written,"On a par with ""American Pastoral"" and others of Roth's previous works, ""The Human Stain"" is a fascinating and absorbing look at the perils and paranoias of political correctness. The characters are expertly drawn and eminently human, and the story is as timeless and it is topical. Really worth reading."
3,Strange Little Book,"I'm surprised that in none of the reviews I've read so far has there been any reference to the fundemental flaw in this book: Namely, that the author (as narrator) casts himself as a character involved in the action who then goes on to tell the reader information about other characters (personal history, private thoughts, etc.) that he (as character) is not privvy to and cannot possibly know. This is particularly jarring in the case of the French woman who lectures at the University - someone he actually never meets!And it starts off so well too. Like layers being peeled off an onion we discover the inner workings of Coleman, of Faunia, etc. An unfolding tragedy that is totally gripping until he finds it necessary to start acting as omniscient author and not the character he set himself up to be. Why didn't his publisher point this out to him? It would have been a much better book if they had."
2,A bit dry,"I had never read Roth before and was intrigued by the book's description. I was disappointed in this book from the beginning, but I didn't give up. The book did have an interesting if tragic story to tell, but I did not appreciate the stream of consciousness narrative style. I found it bit dry and rambling."
2,A Strain to finish reading The Stain,I only finished this book since it was a book group selection. I found the tone condescending to women and the almost stream-of-consciousness writing style not conducive to making his points. I would have liked it better if the author cut out about 100 pages. I did enjoy flashing back to the Clinton era and being reminded of the events that caught our attention at the time.
4,A tale of willpower,"Apparently, this book is about human stupidity. The academic world's small-mindedness and gossip; the phony moralism of the anti-Clinton crusade; the whining foolishness of those who use their race as an excuse for their personal failures.But really, this book is about willpower - about the determination of a man to become something else than was allotted by destiny. The power than emanates from Coleman Silk is immense: he is at the same time an example of the richness of life and of the tradegies that result from denying and overcoming our roots - the ""Human Stain"" is that which society would attach to us, and that we must fight and suffer to get rid of."
5,A Real Film For People Who Love Real Films,"With no dependence on Mad Hatters or Blue Aliens jumping out at you, Easier With Practice commits to a rare element seldom seen in Cinema of late, story and humility. Easier With Practice is a film for people who love real movies made by people who love real movies and it shows. The tight-knit fascinating characters slowly unravel in such a pace that we feel their evolution at the same pace they do. Director, Kyle Patrick Alvarez and the talented cast are able to give the characters a rare humility seldom seen any more, whether in mainstream or independent film.Other reviewers have already adequately explained the story so I will not. I will only say that with a brilliant young cast; an original, warming, and often-funny story; and a hip soundtrack Easier With Practice is touching, entertaining, contemporary and simply well done. You'll laugh, you'll cry, you might even pick up the phone and call that special someone."
4,Good,"The movie is good, and the story interesting. It's well acted, and nuanced in a manner that is engaging. My only real complaint is that the main character Davy is much different than my perception of the real Davy (Rothbart, whose story this is), and I wish that wasn't so. Rothbart, in real life, is incredibly charismatic and has a positive presence. I think it'd have been interesting for the movie character Davy to reflect that, as it makes for a nice juxtaposition with the relationship with Nicole. People like Rothbart we think we know because he's so personable; the story of Nicole, and his inexperience in relationships is something we'd never expect. So why not have the character reflect that? I'd be 100 percent sold with the whole thing. And nice Rosebuds song at the end."
4,Manti Te'o: The Prequel,"The twisty plot, supposeldy based on a ""true story,"" seems a little more plausible in light of the Manti-Lennay saga."
2,For indie lovers only,"This movie is fine for indie lovers. The acting was good. However, for mainstream movie viewers, the plot will be too slow, the twist will be too far-fetched, and the lack of an ending, while ultimately predictable and believable, will still be unsatisfying."
5,new blues music,"This is a cool CD.Great vocals and harmonies,interesting lyrics,killer guitar.It`s great to hear new ""blues"" songs that are creative,as most blues artists just redo old blues classics.This is new and slightly different,but still in the genre of blues/blues rock."
5,Great Christian suspense,"I work at a christian bookstore and see many different christian movies. This movie is by far one of my favorites for the genre of christian suspense. The story and acting is believable and it has a very good message. This movie talks about the grace of God even in bad situations. I would highly recommend this movie, but there is a lot of violence so it's more of a PG 13 type movie."
3,Escape DVD,"This is a good Christian film up to the last scene. I like the realism because life does happen to Christians as well as everyone else. It dispells the notion that Christians are some type of heavenly race far removed from the problems of real life. I do object to the final scene on the beach where the man confronts God. He accuses God of giving him a child and taking her away, of giving him a friend and taking him. And then he says ""I give in."" Th overall implication is that God punishes people and abuses them until they submit Him. By Scripture and by pesonal experience I know this is not true. People do blame God for every bad thing that happens in their life, but that's because they don't understand God or the corrupt world in which we live."
2,Full of typos,"I bought this hoping for an introduction to WAS. Instead, I found this full of typos and a badly made CD."
2,so-so reference book,"I found this book unwieldy in it's size (1154 pages including the index and appendices) and not very helpful for the beginning admin, which is all of us, including IBM!! There are hundreds, if not thousands, of screenshots, but very little in the way of explanation. I need a book that addesses the tasks I most need to do as a WebSphere Admin, with explanations as to why and how to do them. I have found that IBM's online Infocenter for WebSphere is the best resource for this. Bottom line: As a WAS admin you should have this book, but Infocenter may be more helpful."
3,Medicore,I found this book very handy and useful when working with Websphere Application server. Mostly used feature are documented but rarely used features are not documented at all.
1,Electrical Inspection Notes,"McGraw Hill has really dropped the ball on this one. Though they are normally reputable textbook publishers, the code checklist uses information from the 1999 National Electrical Code, which is two full code cycles out-of-date. This book's references do not apply to current construction, and are practically useless."
4,An outstanding source of poetry.,"I really enjoyed this book. I never read start to finish, but I copied many of the poems for my own use. This book has so many wonderful poems, and it's very easy to find a poem you're looking for. All you have to do is look in the back of the book and find the first verse in alphabetical order. This is definately a great book to own for all poetry lovers."
1,Not Worth The Money,"I was looking at the reviews on this and thinking are these people crazy; then I saw the reviews are written by the people in the dvd and understand why the ratings are high, it's called self promotion. Being a Yoga Teacher I can say with authority that the yoga section is terrible and shouldn't even be called yoga and the weight training is minimal. If you have never touched a weight or worked out before this might be suitable but I wouldn't even recommend it then. Save your money there are many good dvd's out there; this one isn't one of them."
2,Widescreen.....NOT!,"This movie is not too bad for one of Donnie Yen's first directorial efforts. The biggest problem is that it's not really a widescreen transfer. It's not even letterboxed. Unless you consider the eighteenth of an inch at the top and bottom of the picture a widescreen/letterboxed edition. The poor transfer really makes some of the decent fight scenes difficult to watch. It's ashame that Amazon doesn't review the titles before releasing the information.If you enjoy martial arts/action movies, this one is worth giving a try. It's not Donnie's best, but it's not his worse either."
3,great hand fight,The over all fight scenes are not bad in this movie. For the most part in the movie the camera is so closed that it spoils the fights. If you watch the fight scens with some extra attention - the hand fights are very fast and beuatiful. The filming and the way the story is presented is not that good. It has lots of annoying flash backs which get you nowhere in the story. I wish they made a second part for this movie where Donnie Yen is old yet a strong and expeirenced martial artist.
2,Disappointing,"Poor subtitling and odd camera work made this movie much less enjoyable that I had anticipated. The story was very intriguing but was not developed well. It was also a very dark movie and hard to follow because of it (subtitles and characters). Donnie Yen is a great martial arts actor, but this wasn't the best to see as an example of that."
1,Arrogant,"These people seem to really hate the customers that make it possible for them to get a paycheck. They have the attitude that anyone who doesn't know as much as they do is worthless. I wonder how they would feel if they were treated this way by their plumber, electrician, or doctor."
5,Alternative to split saddles,"HiI looked around at split-saddles owing to the current vogue for scrotum-sparing bike seats. They were all either pricey or badly-designed. Then I thought I would check out BMX saddles designed for jumpers, and found this well-designed model. When it arrived I found it to be a very robust construction (as one would expect for a jump saddle) and well shaped for a forward tilt. For me, this saddle 1) achieves everything that the split-saddle would have, 2) rides comfortably in a forward tilt, 3) keeps the nose for it's control properties and 4) is inexpensive. As a bonus, the drop-nose gently scoops your butt into place when the lights turn green, catching no fabric in the doing.My new favorite."
3,Good BUT,"Well I agree that the postcards included and the program itself are nice, but there are not enough postcards in this set for you to do the program. You still have to buy more and mount them. This is not clear in the description. I thought I was buying everything I would need. That's my only ""beef.""NOTE: for some reason this is showing up under a Montessori handbook by the same author, as well as the Child-sized Masterpieces book (which is what I am actually reviewing here)"
2,Ridiculous punctuation/editing errors,"Did anyone notice how the things reccommended repeat constantly, have the same activity 4 times in the same section, and the fact that the nuumbers are totally out of order?For example: 1. Plan an activity, 2. discuss feelings, 3.brainstorm supportive people, 2. Discuss feelings, 7.Administer an inventory, 3. Brainstorm with supportive people, 1.Discuss feelings, 19.Go over sheet with student, 7. Administer an inventory.Everything is out of order and repeated several times. It was so obvious that it made me wonder if anyone edited this book and question the entire book's integrity.The writers should try and clear up such discrepancies, ecspecially in a 45$ book."
2,Not what I expected,"I purchased this book for my daugher who is a High School Guidance counseler. The feedback that she provided was that she felt the book was far too clinical for what the average counseler deals with. She felt that some if not the majority of case studies included in the book would have been referred to an outside specialist. Of course, school systems may vary in what they expect of their counselors, but this was her professional opinion."
3,Tiger Woods PGA Tour 2000,"If you've played TW 1999, and liked it, you'll probably be disappionted with the relative lack of improvements to the new version. The graphics are slightly better, however the game play is slower. TW 2000 also lacks: Tiger's aggressive swing, crowd participation, Tiger Tips and jammin' music. In addition there also appears to be a glitch in the software, when you hit a bad shot (ie. shot is hit to the left) Tiger exclaims ""Hook!"" which would make the shot even worse. This is just one example of the ""glitches"" I noticed. To summarize: TW 1999 is more exciting and does a much better job of capturing the spirit and enthusiasm that Tiger brings to the game of golf."
2,Don't Buy It!,"The worst EA follow-up since Madden '94. This game does little to nothing on improving the '99 version. The game play is slow, putting is a joke and the crazy sounds and views are out of place. This one only allows one player Tourney play too. I enjoyed the old Genesis version that allowed you and a friend to play a 4 round tourney using all of the courses. Boooooo!"
5,nectasweet is sweet,this is the second purchase i have made and once again i am extremely happy with the price and the quick service. will definitely be ordering again! http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000K8ESB4/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_title
1,Don't waste your money on this one,"I don't know who this author thinks he's kidding when he said this book was ""for both the beginner and the skilled solver"". I've been doing these for years and had trouble with some of these puzzles. If you add in a few wrong clue letters, only one puzzle per page and mispelled words, you're in for a frustrating time. And don't even get me started on the stupid jokes and pidgin English that's used! Some of the solutions are worded like the old politically-incorrect Chinese ""washee-washee"" man attempting to speak English~~~unbelievably ridiculous. This one isn't for beginners OR proficients."
3,I'm inquiring,"I am tutoring a 5th grade girl on the American Revolution and pretty much all other subjects. Her mom wants me to help her get better grades (which is understandable) but I feel like I'm failing. I think perhaps I need a better resource than just my own interpretation and creative thought. I'm still trying to figure out if she is an aesthetic, visual, auditory, etc. learner. It was an interesting process trying to figure it out yesterday when she was over. If anyone has any idea of some resource that would be helpful for my situation, perhaps a fun textbook or practice booklet on all the various subjects, I would very much appreciate hearing about it. Also, if this would be a good resource for such a predicament, please let me know. Then I will decide if I like the product or not.Thanks, PeacefulVictory"
5,Great Main History text,"This was by far the best resource for helping my older kids (late elementray through middle school) understand how the war escalated from discontentment to full blown rebellion. The descriptions of the battles were short enough to hold their attention but ""meaty"" enough to help the boys distinguish between them. We loved the integration of quotes. I appreciated the highlights about many of the founding fathers who are usually glossed. The activites were enjoyable but not show stopping. The book's value is definately in the presentation of information. I am anxiously awaiting the arrival of other books in the series. I hope they are as well written as this!"
2,Not as many activities as I had hoped,"It has more information, like a textbook than activities. As a teacher, I have plenty of information. I was looking for more activities for my students rather than info."
5,Excellant,My 6 year old niece really likes it and so does her parents and grandparents. Love the projects. She wants to have more in this series.
1,wrong DVD,"I wanted the DVD The Way starring Charlie Sheen, I got some random film with the same title! Not very happy, it wasn't even a good movie."
2,Poor sound; Broke Immediately!,"Sound quality is poor (poor low frequencies, indistinct high frequencies). CD function died after one day, had to return. Cheap but you don't get what you pay for!"
4,A place to start,"Not bad. A good beginning primer on the body of work, though not the in depth analysis a true fan may be looking for."
4,The very nice boot,"This Dereon boot is avery nice boot. Get a pair of Dereon logo jeans,top it off with a dereon puffer jacket and you're good to go.All that's lagging is the Dereon jewelry."
4,Overflowing with Information,Make sure to take time to really appreciate this book. Stocked full of useful information you can implement right away.
2,an ok book,"This one seemed a bit cheesey to me, as though it were slapped together in a hurry with a lot of information in a clearing house style much like those you see on finding money. My impression was the author was more about making money than writing a useful book. All that said, I give it a two star rating because it is so packed with topics pertaining to working at home that it may be worth it just as a quick reference tool."
5,Jennifer Can Do No Wrong!,"I think this is great. Jennifer is really talented. I have her album and I think this is brilliant. She uses her voice really well. To me, it is better than ""Crush"" and I think the stuff she is releasing now, like ""Sober"" and this one are some of her best. I hope she releases the song ""Somewhere Someday"". It's also a beautiful song. Buy this, but if you like Jennifer, buy her album instead. You won't be disappointed. I just can't understand why these songs aren't as successful as ""Crush"". They are better."
4,very nice,I am enjoying this book--it surely is a keeper-would make nice gift for a woman- good to wake up to each day! by using her experience and lifes situations that happen to so many of us- Barbara has turned out a really nice book!
5,A Definitive Work,"This book remains the definitive critical study of Stevenson's work. The fact it was republished 25 years after its first release and is still oft-cited speaks volumes as to its worth. Dr. Maixner's work is scholarly, yet exceptionally readable."
3,Painting on finished porcelain/china and glass...,"This book is good for those looking for projects on finished porcelain and glass. Great for the novice, and the craft industry has a huge selection of paint which can be used for Atkins' projects. Her projects are simple for the beginner who is looking for a starting place in artistic porcelain and glass painting. A beginning artist may adapt Atkins' ideas into unique designs and have a finished product in very little time.These projects do not include ""true"" porcelain or china painting on bisque. For those looking to learn painting on china (as in Limoges, Royal Doulton or Staffordshire China, etc.), ""The China Decorator"" magazine offers wonderful advice in learning this art as well as including several other excellent resources."
1,shipping charges ripoff,The item was fine the company Best in Home (Amazon Division)charged $12 shipping/handling for this $12 light weight item. A total ripoff.
5,"Polly Island, Here we come!","I like this toy because I had gotten home from San Francisco acouple of weeks before I got it. The plane was similar to theone I had ridden on, and I liked to pretend that my Pollys weremoving to a wonderful place called Polly Island. I also likedthe wheeled suitcase and the clothes it came with."
4,fun,I am twelve years old and my little brother bought me this for my birthday[how sweet is that?:)] Polly's outfits are cute but her hair is ver annoying if you get it wet. It is nearly impossible to buckle the seatbelts so don't even try. I love the little island. Be careful because Polly's pink shoes always fall off. The only thinh I don't like is the food tray. The cardboard dinner trays are very lame and not very fun. Great toy if your child likes dolls or wants to be a piolet some day.:)
2,what was mattel thinkig???,my mom got me this toy and i do NOT care for it. polly is really cute and i like her hair and dress but ..... first of all the seats fall off and sometimes the bed on top comes undone. also the door allways falls off and when you put polly's in the seats you cant get the seatbelts on but when you finally get them on the polly's slip out!! talk about frustrating!!!! the island is really cute but someties it falls out. the only things that won't break is the polly and her dog but when i put on her dress it broke!! i really don't think you should buy this.p.s i collect polly pockets [i have a huge box of them!!!]and this is not 1 of my favorites. [ sorry mattel but i like all the other polly pocket sets i have!! i'm really dissapointed because i LOVE polly pockets!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
4,The right length for the footage involved,"It is very haunting to see the only moving pictures of the Titanic. The interview with the survivor, however, was not very interesting, mainly because the audio makes it sound like she is mumbling, and the words are difficult to understand. Also, the viewer needs to be aware that not all of the footage from the period is about the Titanic, or is exclusive to this video, even though it is interesting. That said, the scenes of the Titanic are an important piece of history, and I'm glad I saw it."
2,Waste of time,"I'm fascinated with all aspects of the Titanic which is why I rented this video. There was no new information on this film that I didn't already know. The film is 30 minutes long and to summarize it, an old English lady finds a film canister in her shed that contained live pictures of the Titanic. That's all. No passenger stories, no interesting tidbits, nuttin'.Pass on this."
2,Not Much Here -,"The film lacks original audio, and of course the video is of poor quality. Doesn't bring out any new information, and it was hard to understand much of the later audio that had been added."
2,Not with glasses or goggles,"If you wear this in cold weather with a pair of glasses, sunglasses, or ski goggles, I can guarantee you they will fog up. Because your warm/moist breath is not allowed to leave your face as quickly, it will go up the spaces on either side of your nose and get on your eyewear.Also, the neck on this product is far too short; I constantly feel a breeze on my neck when I am outside. The way to fix this is to either wear a scarf or a coat with a tall collar, but frankly, why should I have to if this product is supposed to do the trick?"
2,One size does not fit me...,"It is simply too small.Although my head is on the larger side, the hood is too small and puts a lot of pressure on mouth and head.It is difficult to breath through the face mask because the pressure holds your mouth closed very firmly.Lowering the mask below the nose really helps, but defeats the purpose of a balaclava.Also, It does not cover the neck area as much as the pictures might lead you to believe.The bottom does not reach the neck line of my shirt.Sure it looks good, but lacks function.2 points for style.I also get a mild headache when I wear it for too long."
2,Do NOT buy this for running...,This mask obstructs breathing too much. I wore it for the first time on an 8 miler today and I had to keep pulling it down to breathe. Is is especially bad on tough parts of the run like hills where you are breathing hard. Disappointing purchase if to be used for running.
4,"Works, but....","Works as advertised, yet I find it hard to breathe thru the material when I'm sprinting. OR I can just pull the face cover down below my nose. Granted, during non-vigorous workouts breathing is fairly uneventful and easy. My head is kinda big, but I manage to squeeze thru the neck hole, if the neck stitching and seam were elastic it would have been better for everyone. That said, it keeps my face, throat and ears warm regardless of weather, just what I need. Winter, step aside."
5,Under Armour Cold Gear,Have used it everyday since cold weather started. Usually by itself in the 30's under my hardhat. With ear muffs when windchill or temp in 20's. Used it under a thicker hood below 20's. Love it and will buy another next season.
3,Quality is FAIR,"This item is excellent for all cold weather environments. Works very well in windy conditions. The only let down is the thread/stitching quality. Only one week after purchasing this item it began to unravel at the seems. The fabric remained intact, but the seems separated."
3,It's not the best but it's not the worst,I was excited to get this item because it was rearing to be a cold winter and I figured this would help me during my outside activities. It's a good hood but the only problem I have with it is it's a one size fits all type of deal. I have a decent sized head (wear large size fitted hats) and this i product is rather large on me. I'd rather it be a little tighter but I guess that's all a matter of preference. Good Item otherwise.
5,Workout ninja mask,"Keeps the face nice and warm when I'm out running...not to mention, it makes me look like a ninja! Have fun with it!"
4,Pretty Solid Buy,"I bought this item for the intent of using it while running in the winter. I've used it a few times when the weather warrants its and I am happy to say it does what exactly it should do. Its lightweight and form fitting, so I didn't feel like I had this scarf wrappred around my face.My only complaint is that with the mouth covering up, it doesn't breath as well as I had hoped. I'm sure this assists in keeping the heat in, but when I run with it, it does make breathing more difficult than without. I'm not saying you can't run, far from it, its just a slight annoyance. I'd still recommend this item to friends and family, as it def is worth it."
1,A poorly executed product,"I was looking for something for cold weather biking and for use in skiiing that would cover my nose and neck. This product just doesn't work well in the conditions you want to use it in. The hood has a very short neck so if you you pull it up over your nose you need another neck warmer to cover your neck. Most troublesome, the weave is very tight so it's hard to breath through and warm air is forced up along the sides of your nose and fogs up your glasses up. Moisture also condenses in the fabric and it quickly becomes a soggy mess. There are other better products on the market. Buy something else."
5,Very Practical and Well Made!,I bought this for my husband and he loves it! The hood can be used 4 different ways and is very warm! This is a very good buy for people having to be out in the cold! A++++ to Under Armour!
1,bad service,"the product itself is decent. I bought it to prevent windburn while skiing but its extremely difficult to breathe out of. They sent me the wrong color too. I ordered black, they sent me dark blue."
3,"Under Armour Men's Coldgear Hood, Black","Not exactly warm or breathable up here in Alaska, frosts up real fast, but I can see it working great down states, or in warmer temps, but it is -20 f, here pretty often, I guess I was expecting a lined hood instead of stretchy type, no wonder it has no holes to breathe through, but almost wish there was,"
3,Not bad.,The only problem I have with this product is that it isn't quite long enough. It should come down lower on the neck. Great for windy or humid times. Good coverage but should be longer.
1,Not my favorite,It is hard to breathe with it on and it gets wet if I breathe through the mouth as others suggest
5,I love it,It's very warm for a product that's lightweight. I love how the face part can be lowered so that I don't have to keep taking off the entire face mask when I need to. Underarmor puts out a good quality product. I think I'm going to purchase another one because I like it so much.
3,good cover of nokia business opportunities,"It is a good read on nokia series 40. After reading the books, I continue to build a set of mobile application for Nokia and Samsung phones at http://www.doitech.com/default_files/super.htm The books provides many useful tips, that has shorten my development time. The application allows user to view their ODBC data at their Nokia and Samsung phone, and sync over GSM/CDMA network. Please visit http://www.doitech.com, if you can find the link. Thank you very much."
1,Cookbook??,If I knew I was getting a small pamphlet that came with the crock-pot I'd have saved my money.
5,Blish Banishes Boredom!,"Sucks you right in. You can see it clear as if it were on the big screen -- which it will be if Gollywood is still up for the terrorist twist now that Uncle's saved the world from WMD. Blish knows human nature and the establishment -- the good, the bad and the ugly. You could learn something here. Characters are animated in tense, clever moves with keen sensitivity and 3-D clarity as the stakes ratchet upward. Clancy with feeling."
5,A New Tom Clancy,"The author is a new Tom Clancy. His knowledge of the government,the navy and especially submarines is vast. I really stayed up all night to read this book. I hope he has more in the pipeline....the book is fun and informative and a great read"
4,"No ""Fib"" about this","Fib Finder is a great toy for anyone. I got this toy 2 years ago, and I lovedit right away. It may not always tell the truth, but of course, it's just for fun!"
5,This toy seems great!!!,"This toy seems great I hope I get one,but I don't know whether to diside.The barbie music video maker karaoke machine or fib finder. Hm(...). I think I am gtoing to go with FIB FINDER!(...)"
1,Junk,"I thought this grill screen would be molded to the shape of the grill. It isn't, just a flat piece of plastic with fasteners to attach it to the grill. It looked and fit awful. Back into the box it went and I got a full refund."
5,Staying put...,"I wet them just a bit and they've stayed right where I stuck them. I didn't put anything heavy on them though, just a lightweight curtain."
2,Doesn't work on tiles,"Of the 3 cups in a set, one would just not stick to the tile for longer than few min. Other two are better but still come off every once in a while. The 3 are supposed to hold a little triangular net hammock with baby bath toys (no more than 1 lbs wet, distributed among 3 hooks). I made sure the tiles are very clean and free of any soap/hard water deposits etc. Giving 2 stars assuming the product works at least on glass."
2,Not that great,"Only one out of the three hooks stay stuck on the tile in my shower, and i finally got it to work by wetting it underneath. The other ones fall of in about 10min without any added weight"
4,Works great!!!!,"Works pretty good for me. I did not have any problem synchronizing from one devise to another. I tried it from my camera to a micro drive , to another micro drive and to a SD Card. It was going pretty fast."
1,mislead,"not what you think buy something else ,really ilrrelavent movies you can do better watching something else unless you just want to say you have alot of zombie merchandise."
1,Don't be ripped off TWD fans!!,"I like many came across this by being a fan of The Walking Dead T.V. show..Don't be fooled by the horrible title..this is just some crappy zombie movies thrown together under the moniker of ""Walking Dead Origins"" to try and make a buck.. I am waiting for TWD Webisodes to get a DVD release date.. if zombie movies,(no matter how bad they are) are your thing.. then pick up this set..If you are looking for more Rick Grimes and the Dixon Bros. then PASS!!"
5,great tea great price,"this is really tasty tea! it has some green, some black, and then the standard chai flavor/spice. yeah, you have to buy 6 boxes, but oftentimes i'll split them with a friend. and more often than not, i'll drink it all myself!"
2,Visual difference from using SKII,[[ASIN:B000ALFT14 Natura Bisse Inhibit Dermafil. ]Been using this product for about a month now. My sister swears by it; but I see no visual difference either way. In my opinion Natura Bisse Inhibit Dermafill works within days and improves skin within a week. Going back to Natura Bisse when this product is extinguished.
4,Great Tool,The FORSTNER bit I bought was exactly as described. I have been restoring furniture and needed a quality bit for repairing legs on chairs. The workmanship and precision of this tool was perfect for my requirements.Amazon Verified Purchase
5,Should be required viewing for social workers,"Mare Winningham, one of most versatile and gifted actresses in the business today, is memorable in this telefilm from the late 80's. As other reviewers have stated, this is a real tearjerker for it reveals the trials and tribulations of a single parent trying to cope in a society that is filled with bureaucracy red tape that ultimately works against her.Grace Johnston is also a triumph as Winningham's young daughter, Hillary. It is hard to imagine that she is an actress playing a part; so realistic is her portrayal. Dorian Harewood makes a small but pivotal appearance as the social worker assigned Winningham's case.The film ends on a less-than-cheerful note that only reinforces the desperation of Winningham's situation.A truly powerful film is ""God Bless the Child."""
4,VERY GOOD MOVIE,"God Bless the Child is a good movie. It's about a single mother trying to raise her daughter but cant afford to keep her. They live in dumpy places with rats and stuff, then her daughter gets sick and goes into the hospital and thats when her mother decides to give her up so someone else can raise her better. She loves her daughter so much that its touching to have to see her give her up. It's about life on the streets and alot of people can relate to that. Very touching!!"
3,Annoying little kid,"Great mix with a lot of great songs. The only reason it didn't get a higher rating is that throughout the CD there is a little kid saying 'this is DJ Andy Smiths Freestyle mix' Way too many times. Some guy also gets on and says the same thing. It's ridiculous. I know it's a freestyle mix, that's why I purchased it."
5,Worked as expected!,It did exactly what I bought for! No problems so far with the toner! I would recommend it to any one!
3,NOT an OEM,"This is an ""Oki compatible"" toner. I think it has been misrepresented as OEM. The manufacturer is not even listed on the box. It appears to work in my OKI printer, but I dislike the apparent deception. Hence, the 3 stars."
2,Fallkniven DC4 diamond-ceramic whetstone,I have used many types of stones the DC4 by Fallkniven is by far the worst one I have ever used. You would be better off by far to get a DMT stone.It was out of flatness by .096 of a inch.I checked this on a Starrett surface plate. The ceramic had a very rough edge. More like a burr. For 30+ dollars I would recommend not getting this. Fallkniven makes a great knife but not a good stone.
5,Creme Soda Heaven,It's the only true Creme Soda I have ever tasted. Why isn't it carried in more stores in the Greater Boston Area? Most carry the Diet variety only. What's up with that? It was worth ordering through Amazon for this sweet treat.
4,Carrots Love Tomatoes,"The book has some great information in it, the thing I like most about the book is how it tells you what the different companions benefit are and why to avoid planting some plants together, This is the information that most of my other books don't have. Some of the content is just enough to wet your appetite and leaves you wanting more information. All in all I am happy to have this book in my library. it is an easy read, and has garden plans to look at and implement. The one thing I wish that this book had, had is a ""Companion Planting Chart"" for quick reference instead of having to read the whole section over again."
3,Book Not Likely to use much,The book is okay but the lay out is not easy to use and it is very basic. I was hoping for detailed charts or similar information to be able to easily identify what plants go well together in the garden. This is written in a more narrative style so you have to sift through the information and make your own lists.
5,Every Gardner Should Have THis,"An easy read, this book really helps educate the reader in companion planting and yielding the best crops you can in your own personal gardens. I have used these techniques for years."
4,Carrots Love Tomatoes,This is good information for a vegetable gardener to help make the garden more productive. It will be helpful in dealing with pests and encouraging good growth in my plants.
5,Must have for gardening,So much insightful information packed into this one reasonably priced book. I am definitely buying Roses Love Garlic next. I think our gardens at home will be happy this year.
2,Not impressed,"The title of this book is somewhat misleading. There is not much help or organized content for companion gardening in this book. Whatever useful info there is it is randomly scattered through the book. For example, if you like to know what goes well with tomatoes you have to go to six different pages from the index and hope to glean something.There is a whole lot of content about the history and use of some vegetables and herbs. Though might interesting info it is not why I bought this book.In short, the book is nor organized well and any material content is thin. I've also purchased ""The Vegetable Gardener's Bible (10th Anniversary Edition)"" and found that to be a tremendous help for companion planting because there is rich content that is organized and easy to find. So my recommendation is for you to skip this and buy the Vegetable Gardener's Bible instead."
2,"This is folklore, not fact","I was looking for a book that would tell me what kinds of plants went well together (i.e. acid loving, alkaline loving, etc.). I bought this book but sadly, this was totally not what I was looking for. It's essentially folklore in that there is little to no fact presented - no sources, no references, no science, no hows and whys. This is pretty much the same kind of thing you'd find in an old ""Foxfire"" book, right next to the ""Planting By Phases Of The Moon"" chapter."
3,There are better books out there,"I really didn't find this book to be super informative. I've read Great Garden Companions by Sally Cummingham, but wanted to see if Carrots Love Tomatoes had anything else to offer. It didn't. It had less. I recommend the Great Garden Companions book. She tells you why you are planting what you're planting, and has everything in list form, which is great for a beginner."
3,A Guide to Companion Planting,"Certainly an interesting gardening book, and one that seems to be quite popular, but Carrots Love Tomatoes seems to be nothing more than a rehashing of what others have written. Much of the book is an alphabetical listing of plants, insects, and other substances and how they can be utilized in companion planting. There are also brief chapters on Pollination of Fruits and Nuts, Nuts Tress, Fruit Tree Culture, and Poisonous Plants."
2,Notthing special,"I was disappointed that this book offered no scientific evidence for companion planting, and offered little more information than you could easily find for free on the internet. I read this book, took a few notes and then sold it immediately. Not one for the shelf."
3,"Thorough, but technical","Interesting, but I liked the one by Cunningham much better. More on an academic level than practical and I was/am interested in the direct companion plantings. However, I will read it completely when I have more time. Sorry. Wish I had read it before buying it, then I wouldn't have."
3,Carrots love tomatoes,"while this book has many great ideas. It didn't seem to work for our market garden. I do trellis vining crops now, and plant lettuce beneath the plants. I realise weather and soil make the difference in growing methods. still had lots of bugs. I will keep refering back to this book, but not plant the whole garden as it says."
3,useful reference book,"I was hoping for a book that would be an interesting read. This one is more like reference book. It is comprehensive, but kind of like reading a dictionary. I would recommend it because it has useful knowledge, but if you want a gardening book that you can read and relax with, this one probably won't do it."
5,Carrots love tomatoes,I love this book! This is my second copy because I wore the first one out! Very informative!! Herbs and other plants to combine for gardening success!
5,carrots love tomatoes,this book deals in depth with which plants do well together and which plants should never be planted close to each other. a glossary is included so you can find your plants quickly.i followed her advice (tomatoes and parsley) with excellent outcomes.
3,Not very impressed,"I hate to say it, but I'm not very impressed. It's an okay book, though I almost gave it two stars. I don't think I found much useful information in there, and my tomatoes and carrots, don't seem to do well together, actually, I hardly got any carrots. I don't think there is anything in this book that an experienced gardener doesn't already know. But if you're a novice, then yes, this book could possibly help you."
5,Great information,This is well worth purchasing and reading. It gave me so much information that will be soooo useful this spring that I can't hardly wait to start planning my garden.
3,Disappointing,"I bought both of Louise Riotte's books, only to be disappointed by the fact that companion gardening is a small portion of the book. There are several other chapters on various interesting topics, but I wouldn't bill either one as a guide to companion planting.The book is very interesting, but don't buy it if you are trying to get started in companion planting/gardening. Buy Great Garden Companions by Sally Jean Cunningham instead. You'll get much more out of it."
2,"Wow, a book that can kill you.","I was absolutely horrified after reading the Fungi section in this book. Most of the information is blatantly incorrect (mushrooms are not plants, the destroying angel does not cause death in six hours, etc). Do NOT follow her belief that morels are a ""safe and easy"" mushroom to collect. They have several poisonous look-alikes that the beginner can easily mistake for a morel. The false morel can kill you if eaten raw or undercooked. Worse, the very inaccurate drawings in the book look much more like a false morel or elfin saddle than a true morel. As so many of the ""facts"" listed in the fungi section are wrong, I looked for more errors in the book and found them. It made me very suspicious of the rest of the information it contains. If you are looking for a good book on companion gardening get ""Great Garden Companions, a Companion-Planting System for a Beautiful, Chemical-Free Vegetable Garden"" by Sally Jean Cunningham."
2,most of the book is not on companion planting,"I expected the book to be mostly about companion planting, and it wasn't. I would have been better off getting the book from the library and just copying the few pages that I was interested in. Most to the information in the book was information I already had elsewhere. For an experienced gardener, I thought this was a waste of money."
5,Fun Book!,This book is so cute. Tons of very good companion planting info. It covers tons of plants and not just veggys. I will use it often in the future. Well worth it!
4,Lots of Information,"Overall, this was a good reference book on companion plantings and had a lot of useful gardening information. As an experienced cook and someone with some gardening background, I found some of the information pretty simplistic. However, there was plenty of detailed information on companion plantings and other gardening topics to make this a book that is well worth reading."
5,Excellent Book!! >>> Carrots Love Tomatoes,"Carrots Love Tomatoes is worth reading! You'll learn so many things about gardening and plants that you never knew existed! Learn why dandelions, pigweeds, and other ""weeds"" can actually benefit your garden and lawn!I am not one who sets down and reads a book cover to cover. When I received the box from Amazon, I opened it and read it... cover to cover, and was surprised to find out this book has been in print for many, many years. Yet the knowledge in this book is almost, kept secret.A MUST HAVE REFERENCE BOOK FOR EVERY GARDENER!"
3,Very low actual proof,"This book is similar to a summary on every creationism book ever written. There is no new information, and no new statistics. In Fact very little importance is placed on the statistics. I recommend to the very simpletons in Christianity."
1,the color is hideous,my brother bought me this as a gift. the color is hideous and the reception stinks
1,Complicated. Lost instructions now I'm lost. HELP!,"When I had the instructions, I was not able to figure out all the features. I, unfortunately, lost the instructions and haven't the slightest idea how to set the radio as the instructions are not something you could put to memory. This item was a gift. If anyone, including SONY, could e-mail or U.S. mail me instructions, great."
4,Gotta go faster,"Recieved in about 6 business days, I swore I marked 3 business days... but anyways yeah I received, and am very happy with it. Well worth the money, especially I was buying the Best of sets. Its well worth price for 20 episodes and bonus music disc."
3,Not bad...but not great,"The underground series, is something that I think younger kids will love. The songs are cute, but can get a little annoying. Sonic's ""Attitude"" gets a little annoying and at times it sounds like almost the same person doing the voices for all 3 characters. The sister sounds like the voice of Steve Urkle. Which I found really annoying. It is fun at times. Get it if you have kids say around..3-6yrs of age. They will find it entertaining. Kids above those ages...Sonic X is the way to go. Even for adults, because it's so true to the characters and the story. Sonic Underground...not bad. But not great."
4,Sonic Underground: The Series,i used to watch this cartoon on tv . it was good. i am happy i got this dvd series
3,nick on stage,"At first I hated Nick Cannon. I thought he was one of those ""Hey look at me, I'm hilarious"" types when he first opened up for America's Got Talent several years ago, but I've grown to really admire the man and find him to be an insanely likeable personality on TV. I admit I was wrong with my first impression and will freely admit it right here. However this particular comedy routine leaves a lot to be desired. He's better than this and he knows it, and I believe everyone else knows it too. Stooping to mentioning his love for Mariah Carey and basically bragging about it, and frequently making jokes intended for edginess and cheap laughs get old after a while. That's the main problem I have with this performance."
1,The Cheapskate Ripoff,I bought this book on the pretense that there were a lot of tips on how to save money and time at WDW. However it is filled with no information on either. I already know to ask if there are any special deals on rooms when I call to make reservations. No big blockbuster hidden info there. I found the book to be totally useless and a waste of my money. As a cheapskate I feel totally cheated out of $12.95 + tax. I would not recommend this book to anyone.
1,First money-saving tip - don't buy this book,"While the first two chapters have some moderately useful information about saving money on a trip to WDW, the rest of the book is much like any of the other Disney World guidebooks available. The authors describe each ride or show, but don't necessarily tell how to save money.Since some of the information is now outdated, if you are looking for a guidebook, you would be much better off getting one of the ""unofficial"" guides (The Unofficial Guide to Walt Disney World 2007 (Unofficial Guides)) or the Passporter guide (PassPorter Walt Disney World 2007: The Unique Travel Guide, Planner, Organizer, Journal, and Keepsake! (Passporter Walt Disney World)).For much better money saving tips, I would recommendDisney on a Dime: Money-Saving Secrets for Your Walt Disney World Vacation."
2,The info in here is CHEAP (a rip off),"I was excited about buying the guide but learned that most of it was just information about the parks, i could read that in a tour book. Although the helpful website were informative but the rest of the book wasn't."
5,The Cheapskates Guide To WDW,"This book is the best guide to Walt Disney World!! The Authors are veteran Disney World fans. They have done it all and can give you the inside veiw on how to plan a trip to WDW. Michel Lewis and Debbi Lacey may be cheapskates,but they don't scrimp on comfort and Disney Magic!! They develage all the best secerts of the ""world"". From the best road to take from the airport to WDW, to the best cheap eats in the parks,to where to ""hang your hat"" for the night,to shoe hints and much more. This guide has it all!! From one Disney World Fan to another, 5 stars!!!"
3,Steve Jolliffe - 'Deep Down Far' (Horizon Music),"One time member of Tangerine Dream.Steve Jolliffe has released several solo titles.'Deep Down Far' has too much piano playing for me,but it's okay.Main two tracks I enjoyed the most were ""Exordir"" and the 24-minute untitled cut,but it appears to be with a symbol,I believe it means 'infinity'.Jolliffe also plays synth,sax,flute,keyboards and clarinet.If you're a fan of ambient instrumental works,you might get something good from this effort."
1,Caveat Emptor - Buyer Beware,"Mr Losik is not an expert on TangSooDo by his own admission:Hi everyone, and thanks for your interest in my books. Beware as this is this author's attitude regarding credibility.In response to requests to share my sources for information:Today, I am an author and a book seller. My objective is to sell books. If I inform the martial arts community of my sources I use for any of the information I publish, then there will be far fewer of my books sold. That is the reason I do not give out my sources, it's bad for business.I have never claimed to be an expert. In each of my books I put a disclaimer that I am not an expert just someone sharing his experience in research and his training.If other people believe that they can be academic about Korean martial arts then they should persue their belief, I do not share in that belief at this time.Best Regards,__________________Best RegardsLen Losik"
1,WARNING WARNING WARNING,"Santo and B.D. vs. the Monsters is HILARIOUS good fun, but we saw it in color on a big screen at a university showing; imdb says it's in color; AMAZON says it's in color.IT'S IN BLACK AND WHITE on this disc. That's just wrong. It sucketh in black and white. It's not supposed to be in black and white. Amazon, change your specs on this DVD!"
4,Definite improvement on VOL. 1,"PEBBLES VOL. 2, a direct port from the vinyl edition with 6 bonus tracks, is a notch above its predecessor; all the songs are great little gems of garage rock 60s-style, even though several of them have appeared in better-sounding form on the NUGGETS boxed set (The Lyrics' ""So What"", Zakary Thaks' ""Bad Girl"", The Dovers' ""What Am I Gonna Do"", The Choir's ""It's Cold Outside"").Highlights include: The Satans' ""Makin' Deals"", The Moving Sidewalks' ""99th Floor"", The Buddhas' ""Lost Innocence"", Randy Alvey and the Green Fuzz' ""Green Fuzz"" (this sounds like it was pumped out in an actual garage, very grungy!), The Dovers' ""She's Gone"", Bobby Fuller's ""Wine Wine Wine"", The Choir's ""I'm Going Home"", and The Avengers' ""Be a Caveman"".It's not as great as future volumes of the PEBBLES series would be, but it's still a fine collection of garage classics worth purchasing for the completist."
1,Do not buy.,"It is a rip-off. It is a 4:3 ratio program put on a DVD to deceive buyers. The quality is VHS at best. Whatever the recording source is, the DVD encoding program distorted the resulting video image. It should be rate a zero star, if one is available."
2,unprofessional production for the price,"buyer beware: it is a copy of a home recording. the quality is poor and it is not worth $22! It is not a professional product. However, if you are chinese and are looking for something in cantonese and dont care about the non-sharp image of the product then go for it. I was disappointed that I had to pay for such an unprofessional product at such a ripe off price."
1,Even a star is too much,"Very very disappointed DVD, image quality is the worst i ever saw; they were so bad the two dics that i throw them directly to the garbage, 22 dollars for nothing. Never buy this product.Jean Pierre"
1,Do not buy this product.,It is a 4:3 ratio VHS quality program put on a DVD disc. I should have read the other reviews. It is not even worth a one star. It did the ceremony injustice.
3,Great for cantonese speaking audience,The product works well for my cantanese speaking mother in law. I recommend this product for all cantonese speaking viewers that want to see the ceremony from the perspective of Hong Kong TVB. The commentary and explanations were more accurate and detailed than the US NBC version. The DVD's are not in high definition as couple other buyers commented. The product was shipped and delivered quickly.
4,A great game for any baseball fan.,Triple play 2000 is a great game for you wether you are a die hard fan or just got interested in it. It has exeptional graphics good gameplay and for the first time ever inerleague play. But thier are a few miner problems like easy homeruns and you cannot sign players. And thats why I gave it a four.
3,FUN BUT EASY,"This is a very good baseball game, but it is easy to hit homers, there is little competition (once u play it for a while) and it is kind of annoying having to tap the button to steal and try to hit at the same time. thats why it only gets 3 stars from me. It is still a very good baseball game."
2,This is Not Baseball,Yeah the title is right. This is Power Baseball. I nearly see 2 HRs a game at least. I like playing games that are real. Baseball is a lot different than this game. It is no fun at all. I wish I can see a game that actually has realistic baseball. You know the one that you don't score all of your runs off of homeruns. In this game there hardly is a Pitching rotation. Your Pitcher can basicaly pitch every 2 games. So do not buy this game.
1,CRAPTACULAR,"This arrived half destroyed, the packaging was all folded up and it is heavily wrinkled. Very disappointing."
5,no calorie coffee flavoring,"I have been using these little chocolate tablets for years, enjoying ""cafe mocha"" without the calories. Then my grocery stopped carrying them. With a search, I found them at Amazon. The chocolate is an excellant coffee flavoring--haven't tried the others."
5,Keeps my hubby happy,We tried this when it first came out and hubby loved putting it in his coffee. Stores discontinued and I was delighted that we could buy it on line.
4,Nice treat,While traveling I happened upon a local coffee joint that offereda coffee with chocolate flavor that I loved.I found this product and now I can have a treat for my first cup every morning.I don't know how they concentrated the flavor but this tiny package also travels well for that occasional cup-o-joe that has been sitting on a hot plate too long. This will fix them right up!
5,Always one in my purse,"This is a great product that helps keep me from overindulging in expensive coffee house mochas! It is easy to carry in pocket or purse, and makes ""plain"" coffee taste special. I highly recommend this flavor along with others by Flavour Creations."
1,AWFUL,"Do not waste your money on this. I waited anxiously for the mail to deliver. Made a fresh 12 oz cup of coffee, dropped in two tablets. Nothing. I dropped in two more. Changed the flavor of the black coffee, but not for the better. I had wanted this so I didn't have to use cream for flavor with all the calories. Not even a hint of CHOCOLATE flavor."
2,Not much flavor,"I have another brand of chocolate flavor combined with aspartame that I was hoping to replace with just chocolate flavor. But this takes 3 tablets for one 8 oz cup of coffee, and even then isn't that good. I wouldn't buy again."
2,Bad As They Were,"Unlike most of the reviewers here, I got to meet some of the guys here either in concert, from the 'hood etc. All left a bad impression on me, so to see them so marvelously pictured here is confusing."
2,Looks like it would be a cool rockabilly cd...,"Looks can be decieving...The cover of this cd shows Conway with an awesome pompadour haircut, and a guitar, looking more like Ricky Nelson, then the afro big haired singer we are used to seeing him as. However don't let that fool you, this cd does have several exellent rockabilyl cuts that he did, but just 3 and the rest is boring doo-wop and country ballad pop tunes, that sound very dated. Although conway did cut some mighty fine rockabilly sides only a few are here. In fact he cut some of the best rockabilly ever recorded,but you are better off with Bear records, one cd rockabilly set called Conway Rocks, which has his best rockabilly sides. This cd is only highlighted by Mona Lisa, Dannyboy and Double Talk, and the rest is filler."
1,BSOD on boot from CD,"Software installed fine. Looks like it ran backups. I went to test a full image restore out, plop in the cd and watch it boot to a blue screen of death, machine_check_exception stop error. Been looking on the web and seems like it doesn't support sata drives. I can't actually confirm this as two e-mails to support (about 5 days has elapsed since initial e-mail, 3 days for second now) resulted in no response. Also waited in their online support queue for 5 hours (2-3 hours being at ""you are next"") and got no response."
2,Have to do your homework on this package. Not a piece of cake.,"One of the great gotchas of shrink-wrapped software is what the manufacturer doesn't tell you but you really need to know way, way before you scan their website to figure out why the bloody thing didn't work as it should.Norton Ghost is a good case in point.It's so disappointing to see a company listing bugs on their website that have been around for years... yet they fail to provide downloadable bug fixes for.What the buyer gets instead ? Technotes and workarounds that are not always clear (yeah, I know, what else is new) or that fail to give key bits of info due emphasis ( like telling users that Copy Drive requires source and destination drives to be the same size BEFORE they try it).So you really need to do your homework on this package before buying it, let alone using it."
1,It crashes and you can't delete the program.,"GHOST when it works is great but it's like living with a tiger: there's no telling when it will turn on you. The program has tied up my email entirely. It has repeately crashed my computer. I sought help from Symantec--I get nothing of value. I ask how to uninstall program (the Control panel refuses to do it). No response. I try to reinstall GHOST. Tells me a file's missing and goes no further. I've been on this for a week, my work is disruupted, and I don't know which way to turn. Oh, I get offers of help for $100 a crack, but I've tried that and the geeks are even more lost than I am. BEWARE OF THIS PROGRAM."
2,Not that reliable,"I got Norton Ghost with my new Dell PC, so I thought I would use it for backups to an external USB drive. After about 6 months of 'trying' to use it, I finally gave up and uninstalled it. Reason, most of the backups somehow get corrupted and the software seems to have trouble working with it. Twice I removed all the partial backups and started from scratch, but again after a few weeks the backup agent would hang while doing an incremental backup.Now, the software is good for making a complete clone of the hard disk or restoring system from an image, but it does not seem to work well with incremental backups."
3,Ghost 10 OK - Symantec support is awful,Creating a backup to external hard drive is easy. However I cannot archive this backup to DVD per instructions in User Guide even though my DVD drive is listed as supported.I have contacted Symantec via email and chat 13 times and problem still persists. Very frustrating!Hopefully it won't be an issue if I need to recover my drive.
1,sysetm crash,"I tried to install this software, but all I got was a major system crash and a blue screen of death,,,I could not even boot XP in 'safe mode', in the end I formatted my hard drive and reinstalled XP, Ghost is on its way back to Symantec...terrible product, do not buy!!!"
1,Norton Ghost 10.0 Thumbs Down,"Recovery CD would not boot - would only give ""Blue-screen of death"". Symantec tech-support useless. Three days between each email volley. They gave me an FTP username and password for downloading a patch - three times. None of them worked. I gave up and will use Acronis Trueimage 9.0. The reviews on it are excellent while the reviews I have read (after purchasing)Ghost10.0 mostly indicate the same problems I have been having. ""Two thumbs down"" for Norton Ghost 10.0. :-("
1,Junk---Get Acronis TrueImage instead,"I should have listened to the other reviewers... I wanted to replace my C: drive with a faster one, and Ghost 10.0 says it can do it, but don't be fooled. Even if you follow the extra steps from their support site (which are not in the documentation), you will end up with an unusable copy that will boot up but then fail with assorted catastrophic errors.It will also give you occasional error messages that are neither in the documentation nor on their support site.A friend recommended Acronis TrueImage which I ended using instead. It's much easier to use, copies about 2x faster than Ghost, and best of all it works. I cloned and replaced C drives from two laptops in a couple of hours with no problems."
2,Ghost 2003 was better/different,"Ghost 10 is a very different product than the old version of Ghost and should be called by a different name. Symantec is so paranoid of pirates that they have taken away basic functionality of the product. The ability of booting off a CD and making a backup of your drive is gone. You need to install the software in windows, and register the product, to backup a drive. Installing means another thing in your system tray taking up memory. If you want to back up the system drive you need to boot to windows, run ghost, reboot and continue. Lots of extra steps.I bought this product because the old Ghost doesn't support SATA drives. I wound up replacing my SATA drives with IDE drives so I could use the 2003 version.It has added some sort of ability to do periodic backups of your system. I wasn't interested in this feature and can't tell you much about it."
3,Install Problems,I just wanted to confirm that there are indeed install problems. I'm on my second attempt and it's hung again. The last time I was forced to use the power button to shut down - no other shutdown method worked.I'm running XP Pro on a brand new HP Pavilion laptop. I wouldn't expect problems like this from Symantec.
2,Does not do what it said it could do.,"I bought this product to assist in recovery, but I tried to recover a program and it would not work. Does real well on a complete recovery but do not expect a partial. Works well on recovery of My stuff."
2,Difficult,A very user unfriendly software. You should be very very experienced with software to attempt this stuff.
3,Norton Ghost 10 a step backward from 9.0,"I have one major gripe about Norton 10. If you are someone who travels back and forth to work and home with a portable hard disk, and plan on relying on Norton 10 to backup the portable hard disk, forget it. You can setup a backup schedule for an external hard drive, however as soon as you unhook it, the schedule is disabled. When returning in the evening from work and hooking up my firelite hard drive, I was dismayed to see that the backup schedule was disabled. I would have to enable the schedule everytime I hooked my portable hard disk back up. Sorry, Norton 9.0 did not care if my portable hard disk was connected or not - come rain or shine at 3 in the morning it Norton 9.0 performed a backup. Back to Norton 9.0 till they fix this foolish behaviour of Norton 10."
1,Does not work,"This software simply does not work. It supposedly provides two basic functions: (1) being able to back up a hard drive to a file which can later be restored if the drive fails; and (2) being able to copy the entire contents of a drive to another drive. I can't back up my drive with it; it gives me an error which I gave to Symantec tech support, and they explained that the problem is that my computer has an Athlon 64 3000+ processor in it - they say they have not tested (and do not support) Symantec products with 64-bit AMD or Intel processors, even if they're running the standard 32-bit version of Windows XP. And when I copy my entire drive to another, the copy of the drive only boots partway and then hangs."
1,Warning - Buy Ghost 2003 not 10.0,"Running XP Home and installation and removal was a living hell.I upgraded from Ghost 2003 which must be removed prior to installing 10.0, but removal was incomplete and 10.0 took three trys to install. It slows down your entire system and had numerous lockups. Finally was able to remove 10.0 and reinstall 2003. No more freezes, lockups or errors. Stay away from this product. ( With the Amazon rebates I hope to only be out only $10.00 and 5 hrs of install/reinstall. Not recommended -Bad Product. E. Caldwell"
1,Bad experience,"I am in computer field for 15 years and learned hard way that you can not rely on backup software until you actually do restore procedure. I got version of Symantec Ghost 10 and have to do a simple task : clone one Hard drive 40GB to another 120GB drive. Ghost has an option to clone hard drives. I run this option and got error when process was almost 99% complete.Then I tried to restore backup image into new hard drive - the same result. I called tech support - they did not have any suggestion except move my backup from networked drive to local. I did - the same result. Well, next day I installed Acronis True Image - cometitor of Ghost - and accomplish my task in 30 min.I used before Powerquest Drive Image - it was excellent product before Symantec purchased the company.To be short - if you want to have a reliable backup of entire hard drive - Ghost should be NOT in your shopping list."
1,stay away,"It's a piece of junk, so save your money and some headaches. Even Dell technicians can't fix it. My new Dell computer had Norton Ghost pre-installed with a back-up hard drive just for cloning. It sounded like a perfect setup except my Norton Ghost wouldn't work. Contacted Dell three times and they supposedly coordinated with Norton to no avail. Now I'm stuck with saturated backup hard drive that is useless to me."
4,No more lost data,I bought this software because I toasted a motherboard and hard drive. I now have an external drive and bought Ghost. It was simple to use and works well. I read through other reviews and was wary because there were reports of different issues. I found none of the issues reported and hope I never actually need to recover data! I would recommend this product.
1,I can't get it to work at all,"There is nothing wrong with my existing hard drive. I am just trying to upgrade to a larger one. Everytime I try to use this program for anything, whether it is for making a disc image or just using some of the utilities, it freezes up right when it starts. The freeze is so deep that mjy whole computer locks up completely and I have to shut it down and restart it again. I have never had any other program make my computer freeze up like that. I'm talking such a deep freeze the mouse pointer freeezes. So deep you can't even CTRL-ALT-DEL to restart. I haven't dealt with stuff like that in about 7 years since I had a much older computer. This product, at least for me, is 100% worthless."
4,Ghost 10.0 Back Up,This product is a must if you want to automatically back up your documents as well as save important files. It also saves your computer configuration and you can return back to a point before you experienced a major problem.
2,Works for me,"I've installed and tested this for several clients. Whether backing up to a local HD or over the network, the system has worked; I install and come back a week later to do a test verify and restore, and it's always worked. I did have trouble once; Windows froze up. This was probably due to poor programming combined with insufficient RAM; it worked the second time.I don't get why a product with mostly single star ratings like this still gets 2.5 stars. Annoying Amazon 'feature'!Since 60% of Windows PCs are malware-infected, I'm figuring most Windows PC support issues are malware-induced."
1,P.O.S.,"This software is a P.O.S. It will not create a ""recovery point"" and takes forever just to crash. Don't waste your time."
1,Just need backup,"As background; I'm somewhat technical. Engineering background and product manager. All I want is to backup my stupid Windows machine. (Thank god I have a Mac for work that really counts). Anyway, I purchased this Norton Ghost and what a hassle. constant complaints that it ""can't create recovery point"". How difficult could it be to copy a bunch of files to a hard drive? Anyway, I've tried network drives and USB drives. The Network drive was a disaster. The USB drive is 50% better, but I don't feel like I can count on it. My thoughts; Norton: Get a life!"
1,Norton Sucks !!!,"Norton has given up on being a software company - their only goal now is to take as much money as possible from comsumers, as soon as the public takes notice they will change their name or sell out.After 2000 or so they moved their cust svc and other functions to India and EVERYTHING went to hell in a hand basket. People spend countless hours with software that totally sucks with support staff that has no idea and no experience. Their only trick is to keep escalating issues around the room until they wear you out and you give up."
1,Semantec does not have customer service,"Semantec (Norton Ghost) has no customer service. Avoid this product or get stuck in the black hole of no support. Their 800# is a endless cycle of music and then cuts you off,only so you have to call back to revisit the same nightmare."
2,don't work with vista,"if you have xp ok, but if you have vista mite look for something that well work with it"
1,Norton Ghost 10 us a waste of your time,"I have burned so much time on this software since buying it 1 year ago. I have never felt securely backed up at any time during that period. Backups fail without warning and e-mail notifiation does not work so you dont know when it has failed. When a backup does fail, the hyperlinks in the dialogs stop working. I have tried restarting services, re-installing, upgrading my network to gigabit speed, all to no avail. Live chat technical support was another waste of an hour while I waited for the guy to respond to me each time I typed something. The so-called knowledgebase is useless too. The only knowledge you need about this product is that you should not waste your time or money on it."
5,Far Better Than the Picture,"I wasn't so sure about this item at first because the picture makes it look a little cheap, but after it arrived I was really impressed. It's large, and very high quality. It's a beautiful piece. I bought it for a friend, and strung it on some jewellers string with marble beads and it looks fantastic! Definitely worth it. I'd reccomed this to anyone interested in beautiful celtic jewelry."
5,Fantastic finishing product,I used this product as a pore sealer when building an acoustic guitar. Worked really well and didn't give me any trouble at all!
2,Mortising Set,This set has a 3/4 inch shoulder on the square bit and does not fit the Delta Mortising Attachments.The 1/4 inch bit was slightly bent and it is fragile enough already so I sent the whole set back.I am going to order the Delta Set. Might not be any better quality but they will fit.
1,the worst product i've ever bought on amazon.com,"i've bought hundreds of items on amazon over the years, and have never been compelled to write a review -- until this morning, during my umpteenth fight with this appliance. i HATE this smoothie maker. it's just about impossible to situate in the base. once you do manage to do that, it's just about impossible to get the lid on correctly, to allow you to turn it on. when you do turn it on, it makes a burning smell, and doesn't do a good job of blending. when you're fighting to get it situated in the base, the otherwise useless pouring mechanism leaks, and as another reviewer observes, it's big. cumbersome, ridiculous.in short, this is some mickey mouse smoothie maker they're selling!"
3,not sure about this brand,This brand seems to break prematurely than others i have used before. Otherwise its just OK. I dont think i will be buying this again.
2,Spare me the psychobabble,"There is a quite a bit of recycled stuff here, but the real annoyances are the mindless crap from people like Henry Rollins, Perry Farrell and others. I really don't care what those people think about Jim or the Doors, I want to see how the album was made. There is too much filler related to the turbulent times and all of that. Anyone with a brain understands the historical context of these albums."
4,When Two Strong Personalities Go Head to Head,"I've learned after reading many books that sometimes I like a story because even though there are number of factors, when you combine all of the reasons, it makes the romance interesting. MOONLIGHT AND MISCHIEF is one of those fictions that has plucky main characters, the tension is good and the plot gets better the more you read.The downside to reading too many Regencies is there can be only so many dukes/earls/viscounts that are handsome and witty. Realistically every heroine can't be beautiful and charming. Not all can be true matches but with MOONLIGHT AND MISCHIEF you want this to be the case. Enjoy Lord Haverstone and Mariah Thorncroft butting heads. It is simple reading at its best."
5,very encouraging!!,"I can't get enough of james! he's my favorite author and what he wrote, he used scripture in its context. excellent reading!!"
3,For $75+ dollars you'd expect a bit more...,"The unit itself is rather flimsy plastic, the control buttons have a cheap feel to them, and my biggest complaint is that there is an audible high-pitched hum that is heard whenever the backlight is on. Not sure I'll keep it for that last reason alone. The interface for changing settings is really old-school; by that I mean almost so archane that you don't even want to bother changing any settings. Here's a quote from the manual ""press and hold the SET button for 3 seconds...press and release the SET button 11 times"". 11 times? La Crosse, there's got to be a better way! Having said all that, it seems to monitor the indoor and outdoor weather OK... which is why it gets 3 stars."
3,A decent deal for what it does,"Though as others have commented, it has a ""flimsy"" feel to it, it has worked for me so far. The process of using the buttons for resetting the max and min measurements is cumbersome enough to discourage you from doing it every day, unfortunately. (I'd love it if it could reset every day so you could automatically see the highs and lows of the previous 24 hours, but none in this class with these options seem to be able to do it.) The setup worked as advertised for me, and the temperature seems accurate enough for amateur use compared with the other measurements I've taken. I like that it has the head index for outdoors and humidity for indoors AND outdoors. It is readable and innocuous enough to have sitting wherever I need it in the house. I think it's worth the pretty low price for the information it provides, especially since it comes with the remote you need for the outdoor measurements."
2,Steve Jolliffe - 'Beyond The Dream' (Horizon Music) 2 1/2 stars,"Originally put out in 1984,as this was the former Tangerine Dream member's fifth effort.Never knew that Jolliffe had SO many releases out,as it looks like he's got twenty albums under his belt.Ten tracks here,but the musical direction seems to shift all too often.From experimental to electronic space rock to new age.Might be worth it to you,IF you're seeking out a bargain priced CD.Check out the used price for this title.Pretty much for the completist,I'd say."
4,Mint / Breath Assure,"When I couldn't find this in stores anymore I Googled! This stuff works very well when enough is taken. I usually take 4 - 5 at once and that's usually enough. If not, take 3-4- more in 2 hours. It really works!"
5,I Love This Product!,I have been using this product for years way back when it was called Breathasure. These pills are the same as Breathasure they just have an added benefit of a coated minty taste. Take two of these after your meals or when you just want reassurance that your breath is fresh this product is for you. I love that MintAsure works on the mouth but more importantly your stomach. I think really bad breath comes from your stomach and this is what MintAsure attacks.
1,Did not like Mint Assure.,"I was looking for a long lasting mint. This mint has a gel bubble consistency, which is fine.After about two minutes, when the outside starts to breakdown, the mint tastes horrible. I also gave them to several otherpeople and everyone threw them away after a few minutes. I ended up throwing all ofthem away. What a dissapointment."
4,Works,These are great since I'm a heavy coffee drinker. Just be careful not to take too many. They will cause indigestion and other unpleasant (but parsley scented) moments.
5,Excellent,"Received product on time and it works as always. If you have a problem with eating onions, garlic, etc. this product will help."
5,Great Little System,"This peace of equipment is great for those of us without a component system with minidiscs the whole system is great, sound and everything."
4,"""Luke Skywalker - Darth Vader"" 1st round","The title says it all... if you ever wondered how did the dark Lord of the Sith ever find out about Luke being his son, this is the book you've got to read..."
2,Artwork is just plain odd,"This TPB is one you will love or hate. The pencil work at times is chillingly awesome. At other times it will make your face crunch up in a grimace!. The tipoff is the truly odd drawing of Luke on the cover. The inking, binding and other production features are excellent. I have seen Dark horse try this cartoon quality art style and I don&#65533;t care for it. Some of the middle pages had washed out colors. Bottom line is that I enjoyed the story and some of the art work enough that it overcomes the bizarre pages so I give this 2 stars."
3,"Not bad, but I've seen and read better","'Vader's Quest,' fills an intersting story niche for the die-hard Star Wars fan. The story is set in-between Episdoes IV and V and chronicles Vader as he goes about hunting down the gunman responsible for the destruction of the Death Star - Luke Skywalker. There is very little in the way of new character revelation or backstory to draw much interest but the plot itself manages to be serviceable just enough to keep readers chugging through all 80 pages or so."
2,not quite right...,"Any of the guys that said that this comic was ""great"" or that ""it gives you a glimpse of vader and luke's first encounter"" is just wrong. Anyone with at least basic star wars knowledge knows that their first encounter was on ""Star Wars Splinter of the Mind's Eye"", which was the first Star Wars story ever written by someone other than George Lucas, even before George Lucas even thought of starting to write ""The Empire Strikes Back"", and from which Lucas himself later acknowledged he gathered some of his inspiration for the rest of the trilogy. I recommend reading that book instead of this comic book..."
5,Exploding Surprises!!!!!Charm Offensive,"23 years after the debut of Translator's Hearbeats & Triggers, Steve Barton has emerged with a release of tunes that equal the intensity of the forementioned group's album. Translator was definitely ahead of it's time and Columbia didn't quite know what to do with the band. It's amazing to see Steve's creativity intact. Steve displays he is a power house with strength of young punk while he's entering his 5th decade. I can't single out any of the songs because every track is superb. The 30 second cuts don't do these songs justice. It rocks harder than Translator mainly because Robert Darlington isn't part of the mix. Can't wait to see his band live and hopeful it will get listened to and bought. Steve Barton deserves success with talent like this. Buy It."
3,Socket Holder,"Holds quite a few sockets, but the slots are all presized. So if you have more larger sockets than larger slots they won't fit in the smaller slots."
3,"Fun, but a tad simple.","Sword is a turn-based 2D fleet combat game. Unlike most 4X titles, Sword's economics require very little micro-managing, and the tech tree, while extensive, is simple. That said, the controls are a tad ... subtle - you have to double-click techs to see what they do, for example - and the game lacks a lot of depth. If you're just looking for a title that will let you build a battle fleet and go smash enemy ships, with no bothering about economics, rebellions, diplomacy, spies, and the like, this is your game."
1,Sword of the Restart,"Bad programming execution. Game requires a patches to play, but I could never get it to work on my desktop. (Could never see graphics of ships.) It's not a good sign when there are three patches released within a year of release.After installing on my laptop and patching to the latest version. I got the game to work until about turn 100+. Then the graphics lockup in the ship build screen and require a complete restart to get graphics back. Basically, in the end-game, you can only play 1 - 3 turns between restarts.In general, this game is Reach for the Stars with bad graphics. Imperium Galactica II was much more enjoyable."
2,bad clock,"This product has every timer you need and is small and discrete. That is where the good ends. It is difficult to program and use. With only 4 buttons and a small screen you must scroll through various timers to get the one you want then you scroll through each part of the time to set. Once the time runs out it resets to zero.I bought it for my wife when she was performing and it was to complicated for her to learn and I had to read the instructions whenever I programed it. Oh yes, the instructions are just as complicated as the clock.Unless you need lots of variety in your timer I would not buy this one."
1,Does not work,"This product would have been perfect for my needs, except it does not work. The first time I used it, it lost power quickly. The second time, it would not even turn on. I would have returned it, but I had forgotten to keep the original packaging."
2,"Display hard to see, buttons unresponsive","The concept of this clock is good and it has some good features: small size, ability to use an AAA battery. However, I'm quite unsatisfied with its overall quality. The display is hard to see (background is too dark) and the buttons are unresponsive. When you set the settings, the digit to be set flashes too fast and is thus almost impossible to see. The buttons often have to be pressed several times until the clock finally registers the press. Also, the clock is not very accurate. Programming the clock is also non-trivial, and requires reading the manual every time you want to do something. So, overall, I think it is a poor product. It is also kinda obsolete as it is almost ten years old now. If you have a smartphone, you will be much better off using an application for that. At least you get a readable display then."
3,Invisible Clock II Reminder,Product is easy to program and does what it the literature said it should.The only shortcoming is that the red button sticks on occasion causing the alarms not to sound.
4,Great features,"I really like the features available on this clock. It is a bit smaller than I anticipated. With small size comes small parts. The buttons are fine, if a little close together. The hardest part to work is the little switch on the side. When you think you have it in place, it actually isn't. The off setting is in the middle, so if you don't have it set just right, it will beep or vibrate at you. I keep in my desk drawer at work, so it sometimes goes off and startles me."
1,"Lori, Angry Activist, Rhoda, Imprisoned Mother","This is a very strange memoir of a mother obsessed with her daughter's imprisonment in a faraway land for alleged terrorist activities. I don't know whether she committed these acts but the photograph of Lori on the cover of the book makes me wonder: Who is Lori? In any event, she looks like a sadist, not a human rights activist. Rhoda spends the entire book complaining about injustices, with a capital I--and her plane trips to Peru."
3,Well written but biased account of a mother's nightmare,"I read the book and unlike many of the impassioned reviewers below, was not at all that convinced by Rhoda Berenson's defense of her daughter. For one thing, the book is mostly a broad indictment of the Peruvian criminal justice system (which clearly isn't very just) and the Berenson's (unsuccessful) efforts to bring their daughter home. Although told in chronological format, the book is a highly selective account that avoids hard, controversial questions, or at best, answers them superficially.. The reader learns more about Rhoda than about Lori, who is sketched as a sort of a modern-day humanitarian saint on a mission of peace and goodwill. Others might call her foolhardy.This book does not challenge that assertion, but it does argue persuasively that Lori has suffered enough and should be released."
1,Biased,"Lori went to Peru to join a terrorist group, planned a plot to assault the congress of Peru. In her new trial, a due process and lead by a civil prosecutor, the Peruvian Supreme Court probed that she participated actively in the design of the frustrated Congress' assault.Moreover, Lori lived togheter with the top leaders of the terrorist group for more than a year. In fact, MRTA was a terrorist group that claimed the USA as an imperialist and evil power.Although Lori decided to walk a path that did not recognized democratic values and human rights, supporting an armed and communist revolution in Peru, when she was indicted she decided to claim that her human rights were not respected.The book is fully biased, aimed to attack the Peruvian Judicial System and, at the same time, to avoid the most important, what is the facts about Lori's plans in Peru. Obviously, a book wrotte by a mother."
4,"A Touching and Inspiring Book...If a little one sided,","I read this book my freshman year in high school and was moved beyond belief. Lori Berenson and her family have been put through so much it is unbelievable!! Everyone should be outraged that the goverment, OUR goverment has yet to do anything about it. My only complaint is that Lori's mother (The author)wrote in such a way that it seemed as if she was saying, ""Lori is innocent, because she is my daughter and I know she could not have done it."" However, even if she is guilty of the crimes charged aginst her, she does not deserve to live in the awful conditions of the Peruvian prisons. This book makes you feel the need to get up and say something. Something along the lines of, ""FREE LORI BERENSON!"""
1,basura in english or spanish it is garbage,"Lori is a terrorist, this book is PURE garbage, and given what Lori was involved in she is lucky that she was not killed. The MRTA was a terrorist group, they took over the embassy of Japan among other things, which in of itself is an affront to all who are civilized, and she knew this and has admitted it. The insurgency wars in Peru killed between 70,000 and 80,000 and to this day it is still gong on in Peru. Her mother should be sued by the families of the victims for any and all profits that are ""earned"" by this book. In the United States you are not allowed to commit a crime and then write a book about it and make money off it, that is federal law, it needs to be applied."
3,Not for Everyone,"The author uses visualization throughout the book, which only works if you are able to tap into this technique (e.g. ""imagine two winking eyes on your collarbones......"". I tried, I really did, but I just couldn't get my mind to cooperate, and finally gave up in frustration. However, if you are able to visualize, then you might find this book very useful."
3,more than a little disjointed,"Due to the fact that Eric Franklin is Swiss, and he didn't have much of an editor, both this book and the Pelvic Power book lack consistency, clear descriptions of exercises, and has typos. He's a genius, but these books sell him short. I've gleaned some information from both, but my critical nature gets caught up in the errors and inconsistencies (captions with the wrong pictures, pictures showing other exercises that are on later pages, mis-spellings, etc.). Wish he would have had a better editor!"
2,not for the layman,"I have found this book to be quite frustrating with all the medical names for parts of the shoulders and neck, which one would need to have had training in physiology to locate,let alone be able to visualize images. The pictures were confusing. Might be useful for a trained practitioner to teach a client and to point out or demonstrate the technique, but I GIVE UP..!"
2,not excellent...,"The original movie songs such as ""Don't Forget The Rules"" cannot be found in this That's why I don't like it much. First film's ost album was really great because I could listen all excellent songs that is used in film as real soundtrack such as ""Hello Zepp (track 13 from 1st ost)""So not a wonderful album. only ""good.."""
4,An Awesome Soundtrack!!!,"This is a really good CD! I received this as a Christmas present three years ago. My favorite songs are ""Forget to Remember"", ""September"", ""Three Fingers"", and ""Don't Forget the Rules"". I highly recommend SAW II SOUNDTRACK!!!"
1,29 pounds of junk,Noisy and way too expensive. Replaced it with a portable air conditioning unit. The good news is the old fan works great as an anchor for my yacht.
2,too many flaws,"After only a few days the mats started to curl up. We kept using them for awhile anyway, but it wasn't long before we had to pitch them. No mats = no game. I guess I could try to make my own to replace them.The command voice is way too quiet. He's also much too quick to jump to the next command, which makes playing nearly impossibly for littler kids, and it will be too boring/easy for most older kids. It doesn't give them enough time to process the command before it's off to the next thing. If they don't know it pat, they miss out on that command.I did find that it got repetitive awfully quickly. Every once in awhile I'd hear an unusual command that we hadn't heard before (like ""spin to a vegetable"") which mixed it up a little and made it more fun, but not often. Overall not worth a purchase."
2,"the most boring version of ""simon says""...","Honestly, my kids (2.5 and 6.5 years) loved this the first two times they played it. After that, the thrill was gone. My daughter kept asking ""what else can we do?"" because it's the same directions over and over. And, even with just two kids, the voice isn't loud enough that we could hear it. I can't imagine tryin gto hear it over a group of children. This game is SO not worth $25. A game of ""simon says"" is free and a whole lot more fun and creative. The educational value of this game is pretty low. I don't think a parent needs to pay $25 for a child to learn basic shapes and colors and to recognize a handful of animals, instruments, and food. For the life of me, I can't see why this game got so many great reviews. I will say that the construction of the game is decent and the marketig/packaging are top notch. The game itself, however, is quite dull even to a toddler. Simon says:""Save your money!"""
3,"""Winners""also means there are ""losers""!","I bought this for my two 4 1/2 year-old grandchildren. They really liked it at first until one child ""won"" several times in a row and the other hadn't ""won"" at all. The idea is basically very good, but I don't like the ""winners-losers"" aspect at all. It's totally inappropriate for this age, and even for older children, there is nothing they can do to ""win""- it's all random. In addition, I would have liked it to be a little slower paced for pre-schoolers (more time to ""skip to the square"" or do a dance between games, etc.). I wouldn't buy another one or advise others to do so."
5,Family fun,This Christmas gift kept my 10 year old and 5 year old grandkids busy for an hour. It is challenging enough for the older ones yet simple enough for the younger children.It requires no adult supervision after they understand the rules (about 2 rounds)and there are not a lot of pieces to bother with and it stores easily in the box.
4,Great Game,"This game is great for following directions and learning categories. It is one of the few games that a 10 year old, 7 year old and 3 year old can play together and have a blast. I just wish the sound quality was a little better as it is sometimes hard to hear the next set of directions when the kids are laughing."
3,Do NOT buy from 4Sale!!! Takes your money!,"Well I am having to file a claim to get my money back or my package shipped, as the seller does not respond to any messages. Whatever you do, DO NOT buy this from the seller ""4Sale"". I do not think they are legitimate! Save yourself a lot of trouble. Hope this helps someone else to not get ripped off like I did."
2,Boring game!,"Our family found this game to be very boring. I was excited to give it to my almost 4 year old son based on the reviews but was very upset with how bored my son and the rest of our family were after a few rounds of playing. I thought this would be a great game for all of us to have some silly fun, but it was just simply not that great. On top of that there was no challenge so I can't imagine how a child over my sons age would like it. The announcers voice was also quiet and hard to hear. I returned our copy and two others that I had bought as gifts."
5,Grandkids loved this game,"I bought this game based on someone else's recommendation, and our grandkids loved it. They played it every day while they were here, after opening it for Christmas. It was good for the youngest, and the older ones enjoyed it too."
3,Kids bored of it,"This toy is OK but not worth $25 and not worth the ""toy of the year"" seal it has on the box. I have three kids 7, 5, 3 and was constantly ""shushing"" them to be able to hear the volume on the loudest level. My 3 year old is too young to follow the instructions sensically. My 7 year old asked to be done after 2 rounds because she was bored. My 5 year old loved it.The games are extremely repetitive and I don't understand the purple Hullabaloo pads as they serve no function other than a starting point. I guess I thought the game would have more of a mix of twister and charades and music, etc. But it just plays a couple of songs and tells you to do one of 3-4 commands over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over.Not a terrible toy but fairly lame and hardly a value at $25. I hoped it would take up about 30 minutes of ""family fun night"" but realistically, it holds their attention for about 10 minutes which is 4-5 rounds of the game."
4,Great game for three-year-olds!,"My three-year-old really enjoys this game when she's playing it with a small group of her friends (three or four max). It's simple, portable, and they get to be silly. I also like that it's not too competitive (winner gets to take a bow or do a little dance)."
3,Fun for the kids,"I got this a couple of weeks ago for Christmas. My 2YO really liked it but can't really play... just jumps around. My 4YO had an OK time playing, but hasn't asked to play it since. From a parents view, I was actually expecting a little more from Cranium. The categories they start on have nothing to do with the game. And it is hard to hear the announcer over the music and a couple kids. It is also VERY repetitive, and I can't determine any difference between the beginner & advanced levels. The fun is having the kids bounce around, as it is kind of ""twister-like"". So not all good or all bad, but I guess I was just expecting more from the positive reviews."
5,Fun for All!,"Got this for my nephew and then added another for my 3 yr. old daughter. She plays by herself or with her brother or friends. It's great entertainment and helps teach them to listen better -- and that can only help!Plus as an Aggie, I couldn't resist the 'Hullabaloo' name of the game!"
4,Very cute & fun game,"I love Cranium games for adults and kids. Caboodle is my favorite for kids, but this one, Hulabaloo is a hit with my 4 yr old too.He can play it alone or with friends or parents, and it teaches him colors, shapes & listening skills."
4,Great Birthday gift.....,"My four year old got this game for his birthday. He and his2 1/2 year brother play with this game all the time. They bring it out when they have playdates as well. Its reminds me a lot of twister, but its more fun. Ok ,Ok I play too I admit it. It has now become my offical birthday present to kids in this age group. Its fun educational and both genders will like it."
4,Popular by proxy!,"All my relatives live in other countries so I had Hullabaloo sent to my nephews in Italy, the next I heard was that my nieces from America were visiting the Italians and that they were all (ages ranging from 1 - 8)having a whale of a time with Hullabaloo and then the next I heard was a parental request from the Americans, please could they have it for the next birthday too! So I've never ever seen this toy and already bought it twice, which I expect won't be the last!"
4,Children probably need to be at least five years old,"I was so excited to get this toy after reading all of the awards that it had won. We have a 4, soon to be 5, little girl and a just turned 2 girl as well. I thought that at least the 4 year old could really enjoy it with her sister just ""acting"" like she was playing along. These girls are both very bright, but I believe that it will take another 6 months for them to be able to really play this together. I may have to sit down with them and just reveiw all of the different shapes and colors and drawings that are on the pads that the game is centered around. I had their Dad sit down with them because I was busy cooking breakfast......I think that someone with a little more patience has to be prepared to sit down with the young ones and maybe review the items with them.......other than that, I can't wait until I get the chance to do it with them.....it seems like a lot of fun for them and my kind of toy....educational."
4,Fun,"I can see where children would become a little bored with this, but it's really fun the first few times."
5,"Long-lasting, energetic FUN!","I bought this game for a family gathering, and the six kids (ages 2.5 through 6.5) could not get enough of it. They all were stomping and twirling and laughing in another room (by themselves!) for hours. No grownups required - but we couldn't help ourselves. The kids were having so much fun, we occasionally joined in also.Each round lasts only a minute or so, and every time there is a potential ""winner"". Everyone has equal chance to win each round, though, and I found that the kids were rooting for each other to win rather than trying to win every time themselves. The game then starts again, and changes every time to stay interesting. The game turns itself off if the kids stop playing - but that just won't happen for quite a while.Big fun, exercise, good sportsmanship, a variety of ages cooperating, and a neglected TV - what more could you want from a game?"
2,Boring!,"Although I can see where some kids (very young kids) would like this game, mine did not. I have three kids aged 2,4 &6 and they found it very boring and tired of it in about 3 minutes. There really is no point to it other than following directions and although the voice prompt is clear, it is not loud enough to hear over a a few kids so we couldn't even make out what the prompt was saying. I ended up returning it. You could easily make your own version of this at home with some colored paper and save $25!"
3,smelly,As soon as I opened the box I could smell the plastic from the floor mats. It really smells toxic. My 4 year old didn't understand the game and my 5 year old was bored after 5 minutes. It seems like it would be a good game for a party - I think it would be more fun if there were more children involved. I really wish it didn't smell so badly though. I can smell it across the room.
5,Cranium Hullabaloo,"Kids really do go crazy for this toy. My 4-5 year old niece and nephew couldn't stop playing, and it does offer some great opportunities to shoot funny videos. I recommend it."
4,WE LOVE THIS GAME!,This is such a great following directions game. It teaches listening skills and is great for my 3-year old daughter. She has a great time playing it and I have a great time watching her learn.
3,Kids like it but..,"My 3, 4 , and 6 year old like the game. it is a bit annoying as it keeps going but it keeps them involved. We received this as a gift and have to contact the manufacturer about a new piece that rolled up and will not flatten out despite all we have tried. But my children have played it almost every day since christmas, and they love the positive reinforcement. They all want to be the winner. It gets them up and jumping around while we are stuck inside when the weather is bad."
4,Fun and Excercise too!,"My twins love this game. It's a great way for them to learn shapes, colors and listening skills. Also, it's fun to get excercise when we can't go outdoors."
4,Fun learning game!,"I bought this toy from Firefly Buys. After a month and a half the volume on the game got a short and would not work properly. Firefly Buys replaced the sound console at no charge and past the warranty date. They are the best company I have dealt with in a long time, if ever!!! Fantastic customer service! We love this game. On rainy or cold days, we set up the mats in the living room and my 4 year old and I have fun finding the colors, shapes and objects named in the game. I highly recommend this!!"
3,Better for younger kids,"Based on the description, I was expecting something fast-paced, zany, and a lot of fun. It seemed pretty slow and a little dull after a few games. My four-year-old played it a few times when she first got it but it has been collecting dust ever since. It is recommended for kids aged 4-10, but I think it is best for kids aged 2-4."
5,Sounds amazing!,needed a replacement on my Jeep SRT8. The stocker is much more confining to the engine and too quiet. The magnaflow opened her up and she sounds amazing now. I get no resonance in the cab either. Awesome product.
3,"Same authors, different pen names.","Imagine you are Ron Louis and David Copeland. You have written the book ""How to Succeed With Women."" Now you want to make more money. So you write a contracted version of the first book and publish it under another name.In this book (The Rules FGL), the authors provide an email address for questions--they promise personal answers. I wrote them. I got an answer from RonL at howtosucceedwithwomen.com!What a scam.I also got automatically added to their mailing list, and got no personal answer!The book is okay, but contains almost the same information as ""How To Succeed With Women,"" but lots less detail."
1,"Gee guys, thanks for the tips...","I've looked at a few different books hoping to boost my own confidence in dealing with the singles scene, and the advice here is truly unique and authoritative. Who could argue with such sage advice as ""Treat women like they are special,"" ""Don't Fart,"" ""Don't Rape Women (because you could go to jail),"" ""Never Hit a Woman."" These are very wise words, things I'd never considered. ""Don't Rape Women"" (...how insightful). ""Don't Fart"" (...has that been the problem??!!)? With this kind of stellar guidance it's a wonder every man who reads it isn't swamped in good-smelling, legal sex.Further, it is obvious that the authors were incredibly dedicated to their studies judging from the fact that they didn't waste any of their research funds on little things like copy-editors or proofers. What's a little typo here and there when a man can expand his mind so fully.Gee guys, thanks for the tips. They were really, really helpful, really."
3,good book...if you dont like to read very much,"While the advice in this book is not bad advice it still is not a massive amount of useful information. While reading this book I couldnt help but wonder if these guys had just finished reading ""How to Succeed With Women"" by Ron Louis and David Copeland and decided to write a book. Nearly all of their vague stories were exactly the same as what is found in ""How to Succeed With Women"" and if you purchase ""The Rules for Getting Laid"" you will find that the two books contain the exact same, even word for word information in most cases. My advice is to buy ""How to Succeed With Women"" instead because it is longer, contains more information, and explains everything. Only buy this book if you want to review the main points of ""How to Succeed With Women""."
4,A helpful guide,"This is a very readable book. I find it helpful at times when my dating life is not up the high standards I have set. The authors make you feel as it they are talking directly to you, which is a big plus. Probably the biggest lesson I got out of the book is to expect flakiness from women, and not take it too personally or seriously. Of course there comes a time when you have to move on if a woman is not giving some reasonably positive vibes, but The Rules teaches a bit more patience than is natural for a lot of guys (such as when you don't get return phone calls)."
2,"Great title, disappointing book","This is a thin book with large print. After reading it, Isuspect the authors are weedy, passive, unattractive males who read acouple of books and compared experiences with their similar friends, and compiled the best tips they could come up with into this book, and along the way they may have lifted their success rate with women from abysmal up into the lower end of normal. Nevertheless it could still be a worthwhile reference for many men, particularly if they fit that mould. My biggest gripe is the authors try to misrepresent themselves as experts in these matters, and grandstand over men who are even lower down the social scale than themselves. How do I know they're not experts? Because they have left out certain basic pieces of advice, they fail to explain why certain important techniques work, there is some dubious and misleading advice, there are no advanced techniques in the book, and their real life examples are generally pathetic."
1,There is a much better book.,"This book was a COMPLETE waste. It is a rip-off of ""How to Succeed with Women. That is a much better book. There is no information anyone can really apply in ""the Rules for Getting Laid"". It just has some basic priciples.This book is arranged like a list of Rules. For example, Rule one: Be confident with women - then a short anecdote about why confidence is good follows. This book is honesly and truely a complely plagerized summary of ""How to Succeed with Women"". That book is very good. I learned a great deal from that book and improved my successes with women tremendously. There is no additional information in ""Rules for getting Laid"". Zero. In fact, there are direct quotes from the ""How to Succeed with Women"" book all over. The ""Rules for Getting Laid"" book is a rip-off. If you want examples, practical applications, and thoroughness, buy How to Succeed with Women."
5,Great book.,Honest experience on what it takes to be successful. You can tell these guys have a lot of successful experiences.
1,Spare me---Por Favor.,"Any man that has to pick-up a book on how to get laid, is equally as pathetic as a woman at a ""Rules"" book-party-signing. You want to know how to get laid, here are some tips: 1)Be a honest and emotional available 2)Stop viewing women as sexual objectified ..., but as potential friends and partners 3)Relax and be yourself. There, I just saved a bunch of the male population a couple of bucks! Gentlemen, the mystery is unveiled."
2,Waste of money,This book is a complete waste of money. I trashed my copy after reading it in a couple of hours.I did not learn a single thing from this book. Every point made is either common sense or just plain garbage.It might be helpful to a guy who has never been exposed to women before.
3,OK book,"This book is almost identical to, but not as complete as, How to Succeed with Women. Thus, I'd recommend the latter. Also not as good as the old standby, Make Every Girl Want You: How To Have Sex With Hot Girls Without Even Dating Them."
4,[good],"I like this CD because I like dudes flavor. I like the lyrical foundness. I dont really dig Cali beats but the words put with the music brings it out. I recommend 110 Bandits alot more thugness he manifested greatly but anticipate ""THE GREAT ONE"" soon! MUCH LOVE FOR MY CALI NI**A, Beautiful."
5,"old, dated and wonderful","What we loved sbout the Soprano's is painted here in detail.We see into the morality, of Clay, a hit man, it's just business.This business can turn on one without warning.One of Donald Westlakes earliest novels.Add this one to your collection."
4,A Good Expansion to the Diomin setting,"I originally bought this because R. Hyrum Savage himself told me it might be useful to my player who was playing a Hearthom character in an online game. This is the first RPG book I've read that has actually made me hate a ""villain"" species, but I actually did come to hate the Gadianti while reading that section. It was also useful to learn the Gadianti names for classes and class groups. The reason this doesn't get a 5th star: not a lick of information about being a Hearthom Trader (one of the spoilers on the back cover)."
1,Not worth the money,"It has nice features and everything works fine except the sound quality. Many people complain that they can't hear me, so I usually ended up shouting on the phone. I had a good memory of Panasonic phones, but not this one."
2,You get what you pay for,"These are the economy Chicago Metallic pans. The better quality Chicago Metallic pans cost $20+ each, instead of $20 for a set of three. These pans rust, even though the label reads dishwasher-safe. After using them, I realize its much better to spring for the better pans, or better yet get reasonably priced professional quality aluminum pans, and use parchment or silpats."
3,Arrived scratched,"Very nice Pans, but not packaged to prevent scratching: the 3 pans are stacked without any material between them so they can scratch each other in shipment as was the case with my order"
3,arrived scratched,"I bought this set for my aunt as a Christmas gift. I would give a higher rating, but the largest pan arrived scratched. Like the other reviewer said, Amazon didn't put anything between the pans to prevent them from moving against each other during shipping."
4,Inventing Cuisine: Le Solfege Du Legume,"This DVD, featuring Alain Passard, is very interesting. It is the only DVD in the serious that does not have subtitles. For the most part, the interviews and time spent in Passard's kitchen is in English. I still recommend this DVD, for the professional in the restaurant business. I do feel, however, that this documentary may be the weakest in the series. That doesn't mean it shouldn't be purchased and viewed repeatedly. It's just that the DVDs of Barbot and Passedat allowed you a better portrait of the chef at work."
3,Just a Regular Brush,I bought this brush because I wanted a special upholstery brush to use a dry cleaning powder on my sofa. It isn't any different then a brush you can buy at any Target.
5,A valuable resource for the Corgi collector,"This is a wonderful guide for anyone who is into collecting Corgi toys. I especially enjoyed the value guide in the back even though this book was published 10 years ago.My only disappointment was that the author didn't put more information about the ""Character"" cars which I am so fond of collecting."
3,Corgi Toys Book,"Good book to start collecting infos and pictures on Corgi Toys, I wish I could see more on Circus Theme and Movie Cars.Thank you"
5,A rational and balanced perspective.,"In a sea of misinformation and emotional ""politically correct"" but factually erroneous material, this book stands out as an example of no compromise on Spiritual, Behavioral, and Biological facts."
2,"Excellent underappreciated film noir, poor Release","I grew up watching this film, so when WB finally decided to release it on DVD I was very thankful. This is an excellent, underappreciated film noir error flynn classic. The reason I give this release 2 stars is for the fast that WB took no attempt in remastering this classic. There are several parts throughout the film where the film becomes faded on half the screen, particles throughout, and in a few places major film scratches. Maybe I'm too use to buying Criterion films for this price, knowing they'll do their damndest to clean up the film before they transfer it. I was also very disappointed that there were no special features. WB has done a decent job with several other Errol Flynn films, this is the first one I've had an issue with. I'd still recommend buying it, just in case it never is rereleased."
2,Waste of money!,"I LOVE Barbara Stanwyck, and Errol Flynn is great, but this movie was a real stinker! Improbable plot, lousy cheap sets and a waste of two great actors. Don't waste the $24 bucks! Get Double Indemnity, The Lady Eve, or better yet, The Strange Love of Martha Ivers (and you get to see one of the all-time great B-movie dames, Lisbeth Scott)! Christmas in Connecticut is great fun for the Holidays (and you get to see the singularly great character actor, Sidney Greenstreet)."
2,Don't Bother.....,"This movie was nothing like I remembered it or I never would have purchased the DVD. I remembered it being one of the good ol classics, but this time around I found it to be boring and didn't hold my interest! Sorry, I can't recommend it......"
4,Good Seat,"The picture of this saddle is a little misleading since the only colors it comes in is red with black. But it is a good seat and far more comfortable. There is a lot more padding than my old saddle, but I was expecting a little more from the description. Also, this saddle isn't all that comfortable after about three or four miles. Of course, this is designed for offroad riding, not distance, so that shouldn't worry anyone that uses it as such. Overall, I think it is a good quality saddle that is proving very durable. I would recommend it to anyone who wishes to upgrade their unicycle."
1,Terrible design makes this a disappointment,"I'm about to send my second one back and go with a different brand, probably Rain Bird.Timer #1, I had to insert the wires into a hole and then manually tighten a screw to make the contact. This only functioned properly on 2 of the 8 wires I had to connect, including the AC... wires simply would not stay in place because their screw mechanism was just terrible. Returned.Timer #2 actually came as a slightly different model. The AC was not a screw-based connection, rather a plug, so that was good, but the station timers were setup the same way and even when I had it all working, I find that every now and then a station does not turn on and I have to mess with the wire connection. Just not worth it- should be set it and forget it, but that is not the case at all.Fooled me twice, shame on me."
1,NON-EXISTENT SUPPORT,They have never-ever-answered the phone when I needed help with a problem.If a company does not stand behind its products-what good are they?Don't buy an Orbit Timer!
1,"Cheap, will not last I just replaced one.",Don't do it!!!! I replaced my broken unit yesterday. and purchased a replacement which I installed yesterday. This model is sitting on the coffee table here next to me. I took it apart yesterday and found the round plastic selector dial broken at 2 of the 3 points. which if you jiggled the know you could eventually get it to operate but I have been dealing with that problem for a looong time.I was determined to get my moneys worth out of it so I put up with it. I think it operated for a little over a year and then it didn't function correctly
1,Orbit Sprinkler Timer,"Returned - Can not be used on sprinkler system with an irrigation pump and a relay switch, to turn the pump on with set time on timer"
5,upgrade,"It perfectly duplicated my prior timer ,which was of the same manufacterer. It was easy to install and works perfectly. A good upgrade."
3,"Works good, simple. Only one complaint","Tested out, felt the interface was simple to use; I prefer the timer functions on this model. However, did not work for me because it does not include ability to activate a pump."
3,Won't start a pump,I had to return this timer because after I received it I found that it is not capable of turning on a pump.
5,just perfect,i got a colt 45 as an anniversary gift and it fits perfect in this bag. love the pink-ness of it.
2,Not as much fun...,"Thought this would be a huge hit... not so much fun as they make it sound. Kids find it a bit dry, easy and boring --- and parents will dread this game. Save yourself now -- don't buy it."
4,if you're tired of board games-,"Cranium Conga is fast paced, fun, and different enough to attract people who think they don't like games. It is a blast to play! Players take turns guessing what is written on the electronic timer's hidden screen. You might be asked to guess what player A has written in answer to ""What is the job you'd like least?"" or you might have to figure out that player B has sculpted a hotdog out of playdough. This is fun for all ages, as long as the players can read the cards."
3,This is not Cranium!,"For those of you who have previously purchased the original Cranium (or Cranium Primo addition, as I have), this is a completely different game.First of all, this game is for individual players, not couples. It incorporates more of the guessing aspect of the original Cranium. This game uses opinions rather than facts. The worst part of it was the electronic device included. It seems simple, but ended up confusing many of the players I played with (no, we were not under the influence). In addition, this game incorporates the use of small, cardboard ""conga points"", which could easily be lost by adults as well as children. On a positive note, I feel it is suitable for all ages.I expected something more similar yet different from the original Cranium game and was therefore not impressed."
5,Conga Craze!,This game is great fun for family and friends. It gives kids a chance to expand their minds but it's more fun than educational.
2,A little boring...,"Not much challenge to this game. Maybe it would be fun for kids, but too simple for adults. We played twice then donated it to charity."
4,"It's great, but cheatable","I played this game before, and it was FUN! The only problem is, when you get a ""Creative Cat Card"", you have to write your answer on the pad.Then you have to get someone to close it to start working right away, they're most likely to be another player and cheat."
5,fabulous!!!,"Stephanie's recipes are everything they can possibly be: fresh, inovative, and oh so comforting. I dare you to find a better and more readable cookbook!"
5,The comprehensive Companion,"This is a superb book. It should be in the kitchen of all who love to cook. If you want to find the most useful book to have in the kitchen, this is it."
3,disappointed,"I bought this book with high expectations after reading the reviews. I was disappointed because there is not much variety - i.e for just about every fruit she has an icecream or sorbet recipe - boring, why not just one or 2 of these recipes, and a list of the flavours/variations on these - I don't have an icecream maker (and will never buy one) so already a recipe on most ingredients is useless.In the berry section she gushes about how you should cultivate a friendship with anyone who has a mulberry tree - yet fails to include any recipes for mulberries - except to note that the recipe for raspberry sauce can also be used for mulberries.There are a few good tips in this book, but don't buy it expecting it to be your kitchen bible - it most definitely is not."
4,The other side of a fascinating story,"First of all, this book makes a lot more sense if you also read Mircea Eliade's ""Maitreyi""...""It does not die"" reveals not only a Bengali woman's views on love, marriage and life, but also the relationship between a writer and its subject. For the sensual, tragic Maitreyi from Eliade's novel reveals herself as a woman with her feet down to earth and a lot of common sense. I was charmed by her serenity and tenacity.We don't get to hear ""the other side of a story"" too often. This is one of the rare instances where we can meet both the literary heroine (from Eliade's novel) and the real woman, with her personality so different from what we might have expected. I could go on talking about inspiration and influences, about social norms and the ideas of ""exotic beauty"", but I will let you enjoy the book :)"
4,Full of information,"This series of books, to me, is still the 'gold standard"" for Bible commentaries. One can skim or go as deeply into facts and theories about the Scriptures as one chooses. The only thing that could be better is to have the series as originally written rather than the edited and re-written one such as this."
3,Not done trying,I used on some carvings but haven't done enough to comment. Does have ruff cuts when used but sanding will fix.
1,what can one say?,"these files are not worse than you imagine, they are worse than you can imagine. there are grinder scratches on the handles, the rasps' teeth ( when present densely) are in symmetrical columns and rows meaning that they leave furrow-like scratches which must be removed by back-forth filing and then filing several more times at various degree angles, some file surfaces lack full-coverage by teeth, etc. my wife's comment says it all: i wouldn't be seen using them. i wanted nicholson; i got nickel."
4,Good enough,This set is pretty much what I expected. They look to be hand made so there is some variation from file to file but good enough for what I wanted them for. I ordered both a medium and a fine set I would not suggest doing this as the difference between the medium and fine is very small. I had a hard time telling the difference. All in all worth the price.
2,Not what I needed due to inadequate description.,"I am a woodcarver and I can not think of any use for these files, they are far too coarse."
5,Domino Bucket,"We received this bucket of dominos as a gift. My 7 yo son spends hours playing with them. He enjoys lining them up and making them tumble. He likes them so much, in fact, that I purchasing another 2 buckets from Amazon. They are light weight and durable. The square shape makes them easy to store. The handle makes it fun/easy to carry. We like them much better than the heavy, traditional dominoes."
1,Don't say that I didn't warn ya' !,"I'm absolutely convinced that Delbert McClinton had no controlover the release of this CD. I rated it 1 star simplybecause there is no 0 star rating ! In actuality , I am not certain that the vocalist on this recording IS Delbert McClinton. Only on the Mr. Pitiful track is there any similarity at all to Delbert's voice. This is the perfect CD for someone with money to burn who would like to have a recording of a 1960's garage band recorded in a garage and who should be working in a garage ! Delbert fans...run fast and run far away from this ! END"
2,garage music,"Yes, this is the early works of Delbert when he was making records with Bruce Channel and others. In fact, Bruce sings lead vocal on some of these tunes before the days of ""Hey Baby"". This is raw work recorded in the basement of Major Bill's home. This or the ""Crazy Cajun Recordings"" is a must for die-hard Delbert fans who appreciate how much he has musically developed over a long career."
2,For hard-core fans only...,"McClinton had been around a long time before ""Giving It Up For Your Love"" and this is a collection of those early songs. He was part of several minor hits by artists like The Ron-Dels and Bruce Channel. It's mostly 60's pop, garage rock and a little country. About half of it is covers such as Twist & Shout, This Boy and These Boots Are Made for Walkin'. I wouldn't recommend this, half the songs are sung by someone else but I did learn that Sonny Boy Williamson taught Delbert how to play the harp and in turn, Del taught John Lennon how to play. For hard-core fans only."
2,The shrew and the idiot,"This book seriously sucked. The heroine was modern and shrewish. I like strong and fiesty heroines but this one was simply out of time. The hero was an idiot. The story dragged along. I read Bride's Portion as a teenager and loved the story. I thought this book, written by S. Paul, would be just as good. Boy, was I wrong."
1,Victorinox = made in China?,"I ordered this set as gift, believing I would receive a nicely packaged set of knives with Victorinox SOMEWHERE on the box. The knives arrived cheaply packaged, with a large ""Made in China"" Stainless Steel Steak Knives as the only labeling. They are being returned tomorrow."
2,Alex's Grandpa,"Worst steak knives I have ever used. They are too large to be useful. They are excellent, however, for cutting through dirt and roots when dividing or repotting plants. We are using them for that purpose in our family greenhouse."
3,steak knives,Steak knives are OK. Nothing to brag about. The shank does not go all the way through the handle and the knife is not very sharp. For the money they are OK.
1,Victorinox?! I don't think so...,"If these knives are Victorinox there certainly isn't any mention of that on the pathetic packaging they came in. Made in China written all over the box... I know many things are made in China, but the least they could do is put the word Victorinox ANYWHERE on the packaging. It's not even on the knives themselves... False advertising Amazon :("
2,Victorinox?,These knives are definitely NOT Victorinox... I purchased them during the black friday deal before christmas and they were advertised as Victoinox. I was sure disappointed when the package came... Says made in China all over it and the Vicotinox brand is nowhere to be seen... For the first time I am sad to say that I got screwed by amazon. BEWARE
1,Victorinox Knock-Off Knives,"Totally bogus product. Clearly labeled on box in plain font, not on knives as ""Victorinox"". Also, purchased on Black Friday for 50% off, but was charged full price. Not much else could go wrong with this order! Returned for refund."
1,Bait & Switch,Just opened the Victorinox knife set and had to go back on Amazon and see what was ordered. I did not realize I was ordering low quality cheap crap from China. Will be skeptical on future Amazon purchases. Sending them back.
1,The worst packaging ever,"I cannot give a review of the actual knives because I am sending them back before I even open them. I bought these as a gift for a true carnivore. I cannot give these as a gift because them are in a paper box, wrapped in plastic! Why would any company package a product this way? I feel like they should be on a shelf in Big Lots with a price tag of $1.99.I am disapointed that I will never know if the knives are quality or not."
2,perhaps a good example on how to get a job you're not qualified for,"I checked two books out of the library on how to search for a job, and this was definitely the poorer book. I recommend you getThe Unwritten Rules of the Highly Effective Job Search: The Proven Program Used by the Worlds Leading Career Services Companyinstead. It is a much better book and really helped me get my job search rolling."
4,THIS IS A GOOD ALBUM FOR ANY CD COLLECTION,this album contains some great dance floor fillersif you like good dance tunes this is for you.well worth buying. great to have for your cd collectionget it now. D.J MARCO MIDDLESBROUGH U.K
1,BLATANT FALSE ADVERTISING in the store!,"I picked this up at a Toys-R-Us store. There was no size indicated on the box, other than a picture of a boy sitting on a very LARGE ball. The age was for 3 and up.I opened the box on my son's birthday and much to my dismay saw that this ball is 15"" max! I have an average size 4 year old, and this ball is WAY TOO SMALL for him!The picture on the box is so blatantly FAKE AND MISLEADING!!! I am VERY angry! No child is small enough for this ""toy"""
5,sponge bob hop a roo ball,"We purhcased this item,it is still unused as we have lost the plug, stopper. Does anyone know where to find a replacement?ThanksJudy"
4,Insightful!,"In exhaustive detail William J. Rothwell shows you the hows and whys of succession planning and management in this second edition of his landmark book. Given the general corporate predilection for systems and bureaucracies, top executives and managers of both large and small businesses will revel in the way Rothwell lays out his well-researched plan. His ample how-to lists and charts can be adapted to fit almost any industry. Despite the author's scholarly credentials and depth of information, his writing is not academic. We from getAbstract recommend this book to executives and managers, particularly if your company doesn't already have a succession plan."
5,Like a lot of other things---it's only as good as you apply it,"The need for succession planning is reaching crisis proportions, yet few organizations are willing to face the crisis and do something about it.There's nothing magic here---just a realistic, comprehensvie, flexible approach to get the job done. The strenghts in this book:- Finding the right devleopmental activity for the right level of management- Design, gain support, and implement, and maintain your succession process.- Lots of extras, including assessments and a plan to devleop a mentoring program.A great value."
5,A bear to beat.,"Purchased these blades to replace a 1/4"" generic big box store brand and it has been love at first cut! The blades are a perfect fit to my Grizzly saw, the cut is smooth and true and i've been using the first of two 1/2"" blade for four months now -- i know, it's not too long, but i really give my blades a work-out. I cut substrates, all kinds of wood and some stuff that i really should not, plus i really don't de-tension my blades as i should. but my bottom line is the job -- and that, this blade does in spades."
2,Poor picture quality,"Looking at the cover and the few pages online, this looked like a good book, but when I got it, I was disappointed to see how poorly the photos are printed. The few board books I had bought previously had photos of various things in them and my toddler loves those books. I thought I'd add to that with this book (this one is NOT a board book, but it's supposed to have photos of real life things), but he wouldn't even look at more than a few pages of this book. The photos are just dark and muddy. As I said previously, a disappointment."
2,I know that I am in the minority with this opinion,"Many of you will disagree with me about this, but I feel that Renee Fleming's singing has become extremely self-indulgent. I first saw her sing at Tanglewood in 1990, and thought she was an extraordinary find. Through her first four recordings, I was her biggest fan. But since then, I have found that she uses the same breathy ""emotional"" attacks, swooping, and over-chested low notes way too many times to be considered either stylistic or sincere. Go back and listen to her early Schubert, Mozart, and Signatures albums and I think you'll see what I mean. I'm very disappointed in what has happened to the best soprano out on the scene - but we saw the same think happen with Kathleen Battle, didn't we? But with Kathleen Battle, it was her little cooing effects and cutie pie delivery that started to take over once she gained super-stardom. Oh well."
2,Affected singing,"Many of you will disagree with me about this, but I feel that Renee Fleming's singing has become extremely self-indulgent. I first saw her sing at Tanglewood in 1990, and thought she was an extraordinary find. Through her first four recordings, I was her biggest fan.

But with Kathleen Battle, it was her little cooing effects and cutie pie delivery that started to take over once she gained super-stardom. Oh well."
3,Overrated soprano full of vocal mannerisms,"Renée Fleming has been hyped up so that she can compete favorably with the truly great sopranos of the past. She is not in their exalted league. Yes, her voice is beautiful, but it is NOTHING compared to the voices of Renata Tebaldi, Joan Sutherland, Kirsten Flagstad, Victoria de los Angeles, Eileen Farrell, Gundula Janowitz, Antonietta Stella, and especially, Montserrat Caballé. Truly, Madame Caballé has the most beautiful soprano voice in the history of opera. Fleming is plagued with vocal mannerisms. She overinflects and adds her annoying personal touches to everything she sings. Check out her ""Bel Canto"" album to see what I mean.To hear a truly BEAUTIFUL voice, listen to any Montserrat Caballé recital. Her voice is ten times purer and more beautiful than Fleming's. She is the ultimate mistress of legato. Her phrasing beats Fleming's any day."
2,Caballé didn't have the middle notes???,"To say that Caballé, whose strongest register was her middle, didn't have the middle notes to sing Norma is ridiculous. Caballé's legati in ""Casta diva"" are seamless. Check out her ""Casta diva"" on her ""Montserrat Caballé Sings Bellini and Donizetti"" CD. Fleming could learn a thing or two! She sounds afraid of the moon goddess instead of praying to her. Her Italian has badly rolled r's."
1,"Mannered, unidiomatic singing","Fleming is light years behind her great soprano predecessors. Fleming here sings a ""Casta diva"" that far pales in comparison to those of Caballé and Sutherland. It is far too studied. Instead of sounding like she is praying to the moon goddess, she sounds like she is afraid of her. Her ""Ne andrò lontana"" is unidiomatic. Her high E-natural at the end of the ""I vespri siciliani"" bolero is a tasteless interpolation. Her ""Un bel dì"" lacks girlish charm and happiness. When Butterfly sings of seeing Pinkerton coming up the hill, she is supposed to sound happy with anticipation. Fleming makes her sound like she would want to take a machete to Pinkerton or at least give him a good beat-down. She is clumsy at rolling the r's in the Italian arias."
5,Puccini HEROINE!,"Arias we wanted to hear her sing, arias we knew she would sound marvelous singing. You could ask, ""haven't these been done before?"" Not with this passion, devotion, and style. Critics will wonder, experts will analyze, but fans will enthusiastically enjoy. This CD is a worthy successor to ""The Beautiful Voice."" Magnificent!"
4,"excellent voice,","I would say if you want to hear her voice then this cd is it. If you care about the arrangements, overall production, and hear the whole aria ewll this cd lacks the background. For example , in the background of casta diva we hardly hear the background chorus. IN any case, she sings excellent."
3,some queen anne furniture from new hampshires federal period,"the book is okay. unless you are a real antique furniture nut, as i am, it is only fair. FAIR."
5,Finntastic: Musical Souvenirs from Finland,"Finntastic: Musical Souvenirs from Finland is a 2001 BIS Records AB recording which features a variety of compositions by Finnish composers. One gets the chance to listen to Sibelius, Klami and Aho to mention a few. Truly a magnificent and tremendous compilation that showcases the greatness of Finnish music. Highly recommended. 5/5."
2,"Nice content, horrible pictures","This book is very nice in content but poor picture quality, would be nice if the new edition or next volume of this title comes with more equipment and arquitectural photos and diagrams as well."
3,"Not bad, not ultimate","I bought this book and thought it ok and interesting. It is not all ultimate aquariums though...1. Photography only average. Some are very good, some bad and some tanks you don't get a decent whole tank shot. What does tank number 1 from GARF look like - I don't know?2. Not all tanks especially good. There's no bad tanks, but ultimate? not really. The quality of aquascaping is often poor, many of the tanks have a 'fruit stall look' Some are truly excellent though... Terry Siegels is fantastic, Richard Harkers an inspiration3. Technical information not complete in my opinion. Lists not always fully revealing of setup.4. Many tanks very young. Long term stability is questionable5. All US. Minor point if all the tanks are interesting enough, but often 'here's a jolly nice SPS tank which has been running one year quite well. And it's very big'.I bought it , and enjoyed it, but there are better books. Fossa and Nilsson's photos of J Sprungs tanks are the best I've seen"
3,Great idea but rotten photography,"It's wonderful to read about other successful systems. I enjoyed reading about the set-ups, what additives were used, the salt that was used. I also liked reading about what people liked and disliked about their own tanks. But the photography is awful. I mean, this is a picture book! Some of the photos are downright out of focus. I could take better photos with a throw away camera. My driver's license has better photography. I'm shocked that a book that is a ""picture"" book has such terrible photos. A lot of time must have been spent compiling all the information about everyone's tank, but no one took the time to send a professional photographer to take pictures. I often read this book to see what someone's set up is, but I never bother to look at it for the photos, which is a real shame, because saltwater tanks are a visual feast."
3,How Are they Now?,"This is a fun book. I enjoyed reading about the different ways people have succeeded with marine aquaria. We can learn a lot from each other. I sure would love to have access to the 20,000 gallon system described in this book.I do have a couple of issues:1. This is strictly an American book. Almost all of these tanks are in the USA. More tanks from other countries would have been interesting.2. The info is rather old for a book just published in 2003. Much of the info is 3 years old or older and some of the tanks were quite young at the time. I'd love to learn how some of these tanks fared later. There was one small tank in particular that was ridiculously overstocked with fish that are not reef safe (most notably several triggers). It was only a few months old. I'll bet it has long since crashed."
3,"Not so ""Ultimate"" by today's standard.","This is an interesting picture book to compare how other aquarists keep their tank. However, most of the aquariums included in the book are pretty average in today's standard. There are numerous more matured and better looking tanks over the internet forums not to mention almost all tanks are in the USA only. Many of the pictures are also very blur. I would be very interested to buy a second book of the serie covering more ""Ultimate"" aquariums and with better picture quality."
4,The Killer's Cousin,"I thought this book was great. Although, it was slow in the beginning, it quickly started to heat up. If you are into mysteries and exciting books, this book is for you. This book is also a great page-turner. When something exciting was happening the chapter would end and you were eager to find out what happened next. If you like stories that keep you guessing and in suspense, The Killer's Cousin is a book that I recommend for you."
4,Edge of your seat-page turner,"Great for people who like suspenseful and engaging books. It was not predictable, and the novel left the reader with some interesting questions about how one would feel after killing someone (accidently). I had never really thought of the implications...not just guilt and remorse but what one of the characters said...the ""power"" you feel when one takes a life. That would be a very heavy burden to carry."
3,Pretty good,"This book was pretty good, but not one of the best i have ever read. The suspensful story of David, a seventeen year old who has been aquitted of murder, unfolds and makes it hard to put down. A must read for anyone who loves supense thrillers."
5,I loved this book,I am in 7th grade and I loved this book! It was really suspensful and if some parts were obviously going to happen there were a lot of surprises. It was also cool because you kind of had to piece together the main characters past as you went a long. The book didn't just tell you. It is a little confusing at first because of this but then you get used to it and it is really cool.
5,Eerily well written,"I really enjoyed this book. It profiled the life of a 17 year old boy who was recently acquitted of murder and sent to live with his aunt and uncle. While struggling with his own problems, the boy, David, comes in the midst of a marital problem stemming from the death of their eldest daughter many years ago. He is forced to come to terms with his own past, while helping his cousin face her fears in the future. I think that this book was very well-written and suspenseful. The author was able to, in effect, tell two stories at once; the story of David and his murder, and the story of his cousins death. I would recommend this book to anyone looking for an enjoyable yet easy read."
3,Slow Plot,"While I felt that this book was well written, the plot moved very slow and at times I felt like skipping to the end to find out what really happened. I think the character development was good but if you want a page turner, I highly recommend Please Listen by Carrie Vanlandingham. This book had me wanting to run home and check on my kids and students. I finished it in one night and still can't beleive what I read."
3,"David is a believable character, but Lily?","The hero of the story, David, is a well developed and believable character, and it was interesting to read about him. Lily, on the other hand, plays a major role in the story, and her character is not believable. Too sensational, lurid - just because a book is aimed at young adults doesn't mean it can be so hokey. The ending, likewise, is so unbelievable that I kept waiting (in the final pages) to read that it had not really happened, that it was someone's dream... no such luck. There is a bit of the ghost or spirit of Lily's sister Kathy in the attic bedroom where David lives, but this isn't a ghost story; it's a thriller, a suspense novel. I think that future books by this author will be better. Much of it was very well written, and the characters were well developed."
3,A compulsively readable melodrama,"The Killer's Cousin has a lot going for it, not the least of which is author Werlin's facility with words and with unfolding a yarn that kids will actually want to read. She's got as good a style as anyone writing young adult. But what she cooks up here in The Killer's Cousin is finally as substantive as goassamer; more suited for ABC Daytime than for serious fiction. Not that literature can't be about a boy who's been acquitted of a murder and a younger cousin who might want to kill him. Shakespeare tackled similar themes. But it's that Werlin handles them all with so little depth, on such a surface level of her characters that it all finally feels...sensational. Add in a fiery ending that beggars belief and you've got a novel that kids will find hard to put down, but which is ultimately literary cotton candy. On to the next for this author--she has tons of promise. Hopefully, it'll be fulfilled in the next novel."
2,Not a Very Good Book,"I read this book a couple of days ago and I REALLY did not like it. I don't think it was very well written at all, and the plot made no sense to me. Maybe that is because I am in 7th Grade. Much of the book was not needed, and there were many parts that should have been there. This book really needs a sequel."
4,Very suspenseful and entertaining!,"This a book about a teen ager who is accused of the accidental murder of his ex-girlfriend so he moves to his aunt and uncles' house in a different state to get away from the media and nightmares this has caused him and his family. Now his dead cousin, who supposedly committed suicide, is coming to her old apartment where she used to live and telling him things about his younger cousin, Lily. Lily is supposedly a little crazy according to him and she is not making his life any easier. This is a book that would keep someone entertained for a long time if you like suspense and mysteries. I liked it because the story line was good and it kept me thinking because it left out some major points in the biginning. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes to read and who is planning on reading a lot in one sitting."
2,The Killer's Cousin,"I don't have very much to say about this book. I think it was probably the weakest of Werlin's books that I've read so far. The story moved along slowly, annoyingly so, with more filler than necessary. The writing was choppy, in contrast to the beautiful, evocative writing Werlin was so incredibly capable of in Impossible and Extraordinary. On one hand, it almost seems like it was written by an entirely different author, but on the other hand, it truly goes to show how much an author's writing develops as time passes. The book picked up in speed and interest toward the end, and did come to a satisfying conclusion, but by that point, I was honestly sick of reading the book and didn't care.Rating: 2/5"
4,The Killers Cousin,"This is a great book, although it took a few pages to actually catch my attention, when it finally did it had me wanting to read more to find out what happens next. It has ghosts and it has parts that would make you suspicious of every one in the book. If you like a book that keeps your heart racing I would reccomend that you read this book."
4,One sitting read,"Like Werlin's other novels, The Killer's Cousin is fast paced and compelling. It's a one sitting read because you can't stop till you're finished.I enjoyed the twists and turns in this one."
1,Pretty bad game.... yet somewhat addictive,"There is one thing wrong with this game.... it takes all of about 10 seconds to win a match. The game goes by WAY too fast. And just like the guy above, the Grand Prix thing I beat about 4 times on the hardest difficulty on the first day... this game just isn't challenging. I am yet to play the UFC games (which was what I wanted in the first place), but I'm sure they have this game beat by a long shot."
5,Best Mixed Martial Arts game yet,"UFC Tapout was pretty good, but this game is superb. It lacks a career mode, which all of the game mags point out to ding it down to 8/10. A career mode would be nice but they obviously are saving that for the next Pride FC title."
3,More fun to watch than to play,"This is a good game but unfortunately there are some huge faults that you will notice right away. the first is the gameplay and plain and simple, it sucks. heres the way to win, just keep doing a submission. the striking system is also a bit faulty because you can knock someone out if you are on your back. it doesnt work that way in real life if someone is mounted on you. the create a fighter is fun but there are a lack of options for what you can wear, and practically everything that the real fighters wear, you can not. there is also no season mode, just single and grand prix. not much to it. i was pretty disappointed by it, but its amusing for parties and a ton of fun to do a grand prix with random characters so you can have the craziest matches and just watch it. at this price though, i would recomend it, or you can just wait for UFC sudden impact, which will hopefully be much better than this."
5,Perfection that is hard to achieve with electronics...,It took a total of about 20 minutes and I had a higher capacity HDD running with all of the EXACT data from my old drive. This could not have worked any better and I am 100% pleased. Fantastic!!! Also works as a great backup tool for your data.
5,Super TV,"This is a great TV. The front and rear A/V inputs are real handy. This TV also has an S-Video cable input--I am using an gold plated S-Video cable, and I get an awesome picture on my DVD! The remote is real easy to use, and you can control your VCR, DVD, Stereo, and many other stereo equipment with it. The picture quality is great, and I am using an antenna, so I can only imagine what cable/Direct TV would be like. This TV also has picture in a picture, which is real handy during football season. I am real happy with this TV, I got my money's worth and then some!"
3,Average,"This TV is a good buy, but it would definately be worth it topay a little extra for a TV with component video inputs, as thereception from S-Video is HORRENDOUS on this model. END"
4,Overall a good a T.V.,"This t.v. is pretty good the colors aren't as bright as i would like them to be (sony trinitron), but i think i can mess with the controls a little bit. The sound is good. If you want more pronounced colors get a sony."
4,Great Collection,"Warren Pereira's compilation of short films showcases his amazing work in art direction, editing, and cinematography. I absolutely love the perspective of each piece and was impressed with the soundtracks which seemed tailor made for each short. Thematically, the pieces artfully explore and question not only societal mores, but also personal, internal struggles. Modern, edgy, sexy, and fun, Pereira's collection is worth looking into."
5,"Sharp, satisyfing and intellectually stimulating, this collection is worth your time.","""The Short Films of Warren Pereira"" is a sexy, smart and entertaining collection. Who should watch it? Anyone who wants to be inspired to think and enjoys great cinematography, without having to sit through a 2 hour film to feel satisfied. The stories are sharp and witty, with just the right balance of edge, sex, satire and visual appeal to keep you thoroughly engaged throughout. Most interesting is that Warren, writer and director also acts in the films. This allows for flawless execution of each story, and intrigues you to question his own personal views on topics the films tackle such as our obsession with image and the absurdity of what we value in today's society."
1,Leaking seams after 10 days of use.,What a disappointment - we used our bounce house for a little over a week. My 2 boys are well under the weight limit and we were careful to abide by all safety precautions. The seam over the door started leaking and quickly widened to a large hole.I called Banzai Customer Service and then faxed them my receipt as per their request. No response from them. I called back 3 days later and was informed they couldn't find my fax and more importantly they could not send me a new Bounce 'n Slide because they are out of stock until the Spring! What? I am now trying to get my money back and/or will report them to the Better Business Bureau. This was not a cheap toy and the warranty is not being honored.Do not buy this bounce house - you will be disappointed.
3,useful for a little more than a year,"First, we switched cords because the one provided is a bit short. But the phone was as good as advertised until the plastic that holds the phone to the wall became brittle and broke off. Now it just hangs there from the wall by the little wire that connects to the jack, begging to be replaced."
2,Shrinks far too much,"This mostly did it's job, but after washing it a half dozen times I can barely stretch the pad to cover the mattress. You might want to hang this item dry, or it won't last more than a couple of years. I would hope that a fitted item like this would be pre shrunk."
2,"Contains PVC coating, would you want your baby inhaling it?","WEll made, durable, but potentially toxic. Parents concerned about long-term health of their children will opt for a more child-friendly form of waterproofing."
5,"Helps Baby ""Sleeps Like a Baby""","My baby loves this mattress and sleeps better on it than her old bassinet. Structurally the mattress is sturdy, supportive, and not too firm."
1,Doesn't Fit--Don't waste your money!,"We were given a Carter's mattress pad as a gift, but I wanted to buy ""the best"" so I got the Sealy. I washed/dried it and tried to put it on the mattress. It says right on the tag on the pad that the cover must wrap under the mattress at least 2"" on all sides to prevent entanglement (a suffocation hazard). Well, it didn't even cover the sides of the mattress, let alone 2"" underneath. We have a standard size crib mattress so it obviously shrank even though it says it is preshrunk. I had to use the Carter's pad which fits fine and doesn't pose a suffocation hazard. Both have the same dimensions on the package too--28 X 52."
2,didn't survive one wash,"From the reviews, I thought this pad was a winner. But after one wash, the edge of the quilted padding attached to the elastic siding ripped. This left about a one foot tear. Fluke or quality control issue? I don't know. Needless to say, I am returning it."
2,no good,Just bought this item and exactly followed the washing instruction to wash it in sensitive cycle and dry it in very very low heat (sensitive care cycle). It already has a few tears! This was only the first wash! The reason I give it 2 stars is that it still fits in the mattress. I guess it is not completely useless.
2,"""Deep"" pocket too shallow","I registered for a couple of these, and was glad to have the chance to try them out months before my twins are scheduled to arrive. We have regular Sealy crib mattresses, but the pockets on this pad were only large enough to fit down the sides of the mattress, not wrap around underneath. I was concerned that this might be a safety issue, and ended up exchanging these crib mattress pads for ones with ""extra deep"" pockets by Continental Quilting, which fit much better."
1,There's a better one available for the same price,"I accidentally bought this mattress pad, thinking it was the same as the one I already had, when I went to buy a second. It's not very good quality. Every time I go to put it on the mattress it feels like my fingers are going to poke through the cheap stretchy sides. And it only barely covers the mattress; it's pretty much holding on for dear life at the corners. I have a Sealy mattress from Babies R Us and it's not extra thick, so there's no reason this shouldn't fit. For the same price, you're much better off going with the UltraSoft Quilted Mattress Pad by Continental Quilting. I have one of those and it is *great*. It fits the mattress really well, with no chance of it popping off. I wash it all the time and it hasn't shrunk a bit."
5,Buy this!,"I am lucky in that I sometimes get to hear Eick play live. My fiance and I have become E.S. fans! This album seems to convey what he does in small venues, and is infiitely enjoyable. Buy it, get some good wine, and give it a listen with someone you love. From a talented musician (and a nice guy)comes this charming compilation."
5,Great Supplement!,This book has many great ideas for sharing student work. You can use this for both fiction and non-fiction writing. The data disks were an especially big hit with my students.
4,84 short lessons on business leadership,"84 short lessons which can be read independently. Each lesson is mainly a short advice, including some common sense. It will not make you a MBA, but it certainly gives you series of inspiring ideas and thoughts. Some live examples would have lifted this book to the top. Forget about moving cheese. Buy it, read it, act it."
5,"A book for the ""Just Do It"" crowd","Paul Lemberg lays it on the line in this book and gives the reader exercises and information needed to get moving in business and in life.If you're looking for a book on business theory, don't look here. This book is about getting things done. It's about breakthrough thinking and methods for enhancing your ability to work faster, think clearer, and accomplish more.This book is essential reading for anyone thinking about or in the process of starting an enterprise. It's also for anyone looking to create change in their life. Faster Than the Speed of Change is filled with activities (do them!--don't just read them) that really effect change.If you want to make things happen, read this book and use it as your guide to growth and breakthrough change."
1,poor quilty,"the vist had not stood up well, one of the button broke the firt time I wore it.The vest is not holding as well as I hope, not worth the money"
2,sized very small,This 4xl vest is the same size as my other 2xl vests and kinda short to. if you are a 2xl buy a 4xl if you are a 3xl don't waste your money. great quality. and the tie is nice.
2,Get less than what you pay for.,"The vest and tie are well matched and look nice. However, the size was WAY off. It was advertised as being a ""4x"" (chest 54). I wear a 52L suit and this vest was too small. I ordered it large on purpose and was disappointed with the mismatch in size. Also, the buttons are REALLY cheap plastic back. One of them broke and would not glue together (too thin of material). I had to pay a seamstress $20 to repair the vest...same price I paid for the whole thing.Next time I'll spend a little more for a better product that wound up costing me double the ""bargain"" price."
2,disappointed,"If you really like jazz, then you may like this CD. I purchased it because Dave Matthews is on it. I have to admit that I ended up selling it, as it is just not my cup of tea -- Dave does not have a big role in this CD, and in summary, I found it boring. It's not the worst thing I've ever listened to, but just not my taste."
4,Wonderful Smooth Jazz,"This is an excellent compelation by very talented muscians. I too am a Dave Matthews Band fan which is what initially attracted me to the album. The reason I bought it however was becasue I am a fan of Jazz. This album is amazingly smooth, and as a fan of Piano, I really appreciated the smooth transitions and playing of Soko. The reason I give it only four stars is that I feel only the first five tracks (which happens to be the tracks that Leroi Moore, DMB sax guy extraordinare play on) are the only ones I really enjoyed. I didn't particularly liked the last three. I also have issues with some sloppy and excessive piano parts. This isn't to say there missed notes, just very excited and ""busy"" moments where the smoothness was lost. It was brief, however, so don't worry. Whereas I wouldn't go far to call this a ""Must Have"", if you enjoy jazz and don't mind spending for quality music, I highly recommend this."
3,A Change of Pace,"When I saw this CD on Amazon, I knew I was taking a chance. But I figured, ""I like Dave Matthews. I like Jazz. What could go wrong?"" Well, the answer is nothing really. I can't say I dislike the album, but it lacks punch. It's not bad for those super-mellow days, but really nothing groundbreaking. I can think of many CD's of both Dave Matthews and Jazz that I would rather buy."
4,If You're Into Toy Cameras...,"The Olympia is like looking at a hooker through beer goggles. The massive camera body and flash make it look oh-so credible and much, much prettier than it actually is. It even comes with a trusty looking bag. Then you take it home and find out it's made of cheap-o plastic and the pictures are grainy and otherworldly and you're immediately filled with regret and shame. If you're looking for a quality SLR, this is not your camera and if I could give less than zero stars I would.HOWEVER, if you like this sort of thing (and I do), this camera is awesome. The Olympia is designed to appeal to the ""lomography"" and lo-fi aesthetic, along the lines of Holga and Diana.Here's a clue that it's not a quality SLR - it costs $19.98. Bottom line: it's a cheap piece of crap, but if that's what you're looking for and you like toy cameras I give it four stars."
1,DO NOT BUY,"this is by far the worst product i have ever bought in amazon...it simply does not work, and it is like $15, for one little plastic vover wich doesnt work..AMAZON should take it off its shelves"
3,Not bad,"Was hoping for a little better, considering the price. The kids love it. It does not look so bad on the coffee table."
4,A bittersweet tale of marriage and infidelity.,"Julie Christie can convey more emotions with a single glance, or a drag from a cigarette, than any actress in recent cinema history. Pity that we do not see more of her on the screen, and how sad it is that she lost the Academy Award to Helen Hunt in her ""made-for-TV"" performance in ""As Good As It Gets."" Fine performances by the ensemble cast."
4,"Great Acting, Great Story","I thought the movie was great overall. The story is very deep and moving, nicely woven, and even though Nick Nolte might not have had the 'sexy' look required for his part, I think he more than compensated for it with his aura. The movie engages you from start to finish and Julie Christie was amazing. Rent it, especially if you're in the mood for something romantic, yet different in its take from a lot of what is out there today."
4,A seventies movie for the new millennium,"I rented this video as I like the combination of Nick Nolte and and especially Julie Christie who we do not see much of these days. But this is a relaxing movie definitely an afterglow over a bottle of red wine. I thought the acting was good and the film had a relaxed feel about it but never boring. Overall if you wish to see a leisurely well acted film on perhaps a moonlit evening then this is for you. Julie Christie has never been this good since ""Don't look now""."
2,be prepared with a big bottle of sterilizing solution,ive done my darnedest to forget this movie i watched 3 months back. despite the presence of nick nolte and julie christie (two actors i usually like) i found this just another piece of alan rudolpf cowardly soft-core porn. i felt dirty after watching it; i feel dirty now.
2,disappointing,"I really wanted to like this movie, but, in the end, it just wouldn't let me. The pace was slow but the characters seemed to have interesting possiblilties at first. The actors, as far as I could tell, did a good job with the material they were given. The weakness was in the story. It didn't go anywhere. The characters didn't learn anything. They were no different at the end than the beginning accept one of them was pregnant. The character of Jeffrey was contradictory and hard to believe. He was one minute frigid and almost robotic, then the next sex-crazed over an older woman. He admits to himself that he loves his wife and yet goes out of his way to say something especially cutting to her simply because she wants a baby. He pretends to live on the edge, but is ultra-controlled and lifeless. The other characters were more likable but just as incapable of learning or evolving. So what was the point? Very unsatisfying."
3,Just OK,"I have to subtract 2 stars just on the basis of having cast Nolte as a womanizer. That guy isn't aging well at all and he's just plain disgusting to watch. He's a total lech. The rest of the movie is all right...nothing special, but not terrible either."
2,Afterburn,"Christie and Boyle sink their teeth into great parts but this love rectangle unfolds too slowly to be that entertaining. Rudolph's attempts at screwball comedy are ill conceived, but his direction is good. Too bad his male characters do nothing but think with, uh, you know."
4,Great Creole food!,It has some wonderful recipes that sound mouthwatering! I would really like a copy of this book! Most of the recipes are fairly easy. Even the vegetable loaf sounds good and I tend to stay away from foods that sound like meat replacement.
5,This is one cookbook that should be in everyone's kitchen.,"I have lived in New Orleans all my life and have used these recipes. I can say that they are authenic ""Dooky Chase"" cuisine. My family and I would dine there as often as we could and we were never disappointed, everything was always delicious. Using these recipes has brought back very fond memories. I lost my original copy in transit from New Orleans, so now that I am living in San Diego, Im ordering a brand new copy. ""Thanks You very much, Leah. You and your wonderful cuisine will always be remembered""."
5,New Orleans National Treasure,"As an official honorary citizen of New Orleans, I have enjoyed many a meal at Dooky Chase. Since I live in Los Angeles I was delighted to be able to get some of Mrs Chase's wonderful recipes. They are practical, easy to read, and absolutely delicious--though of course no one can duplicate her particular genius by themselves.I also loved reading her anecdotes of the restaurant and the stories behind some of the recipes. I think the ""culture"" around a cuisine is a major part of the pleasure.Leah Chase is major figure in our country's heritage. I mean it. The book is a delight."
4,"Right size, but...","My Viper alarm came with one of these 4 years ago. It finally gave out, and I needed a replacement.There were other much cheaper universal alarm sirens I could have used, but they were much bigger than this one. Since the wiring in my car was already run to a particular spot, and there was nowhere else in my engine bay with enough room to hold a siren bigger than this, I bought this one again.Only wish it was a bit louder, but for the size, it's pretty loud."
5,Quick and easy installment,"This horn is smaller than the one that I replaced. It has a light chirps, but when it goes into alarm mode IT IS LOUD. I did not cut any wires with installing it I just connected two wires, one which was the ground wire to the car chasis, and that was it."
3,About The Cross CrossPad XP Digital Notpad,"I have a CrossPad XP it has a serial port cable with two looks like connections for mouse & keyboard, the connector on the pad does not hook up to USB or it is missing the USB hookup, I see a connector deep inide it but know not what it is?Can the USB part be pulled away from another connecting part? It slides into the CrossPad too deep to connect the USB but it is not a USB connection it has little teeth, the cable has a USB then forks into two small round connectors one of them hooks fine to the Serial Port conversion,it came with it, must be missing the other connector or it hooks up to PC keyboard? Anyone know about this product? I went to the Crosspad XP website looks like the domain is up for sale?"
4,Fantastic descriptions,"Read this book for the stylistic surroundings, not for the plot. Lit is a teenager caught between this world and a world that she just learns she is a part of. She is faced with the decision of which world to stay with. While I appreciated the intricate and fantastic descriptions of the various times in history that Lit is suddenly able to see, and the dark changing house of Bolerium, I didn't really understand why all of this was happening until the the last few pages. I was minorly disappointed in the Hollywood-type ending when Lit is going through the streets of her hometown of Kamensic. Still, if this book were to end up a series, I would definitely read it. I'm rating it 4 stars because of the great descriptions, not because of the storyline."
1,Not up to Par,"I like Elizabeth Hand's writing, but to be honest, it was a chore to get through this book. It had fairly decent reviews, so I went ahead and read it. Maybe I just didn't get it, I read it pretty fast, but it just seemed so random in parts, the narrative was so abstract, and I could never get into it. I loved Waking the Moon, plot holes and all, and Winterlong was fairly good (till the end). To me, it seemed like she was continuing the themes of those two prior books, but it was nowhere near as satisfying or enjoyable. I finished it out of loyalty to her. I didn't like the characters, I didn't relate to them at all. Even the main character, I couldn't understand her motivations, what she was doing, or why she stuck around. Overall, a disapointing read. Given the choice, read Waking the Moon, a much better book, even though it does have problems of it's own."
5,Love These Strings,"These strings add such a wonderful warm tone! They set in nice and quick, and are very stable. But, as each violin has it's own sound, you may find that you prefer one type of strings over another, depending on the instrument. It is time for a new instrument and this is one of three that will be tried first."
1,Don't be fooled,This film is so amateur. The acting is atrocious. The situations totally not credible. The dialogue is silly. I bought this dvd on the basis of the reviews on amazon. I can only believe the reviews were posted by the filmmakers as these are truly bad movies. Don't buy!
1,"Very Disapointed, but great idea","I loved the idea of this bouncy house. My daughter loves to jump and climb and bounce. We bought this for her 5th birthday and used it only one weekend. By the end of the weekend, the seams were coming apart. It was loosing air in many places throughout the structure. It's really too bad I had to return it because I can't find another one I think she would enjoy as much."
5,Talent,"Talent is the word that comes to mind when listening to these guys. Go figure, but I hear influences of Van Morrison, Lou Reed, Jr Walker, and even Commander Cody-- all rockabillied together and sounding goooooood. I really, really like the title track, American Dreams, along with Plain Jane, Mr Rogers, Kiss and Tell, I-70, and that neat rendition of Devra's Delight. It's alllll goooood, and I think this album would appeal to a wide audience across the globe."
5,Great Item! I am very happy with this purchase!! Great,Great Item! I am very happy with this purchase!! Great Item! I am very happy with this purchase!! Great Item! I am very happy with this purchase!!
2,Breakdown,"I have owned this unit for about 18 months. Was great while it worked. Now the Minidisc won't record. Get a TOC W error. This requires service at a cost of about [$$], which is about what I paid for it."
5,Excellent !!!,"I am from Brazil and this travel book has been an excellent help to my future travel (on January / 06). It has a lot of maps, good tips for all budgets, great itineraries and, the most important, is too organized.Certainly, it is a very good purchase for all."
5,"Fab chillers, great deal!","I love these drink chillers. The size is perfect, they are not tragically fragile, and they are super stylish. I had been looking at this same product for $20 a set on other sites, so this purchase was quite the deal!"
2,Big let down,"I'm not surprised that no-one else has reviewed this book, as it was a great disappointment to me, even though I'm part of the intended audience - a professional photographer changing from film to digital. Unfortunately I found little new information here, and what I did find was not clearly enough explained for me to be able to apply. Perhaps the greatest disappointment, though, are the images. I never fail to be inspired by images in other Amphoto publications, but those in this book are too ordinary to warrant publication or emulation. Guess I'll go back to learning the hard way - by trial and error."
1,IT STINKS!!!!!!,"IHATE IT!!!!!! O.K., when you play the game, you pick up a card, and you say what it says and you secritly type in a ansewer, and they put in the wrong ansewer, AND IT SAYS IT IS THE RIGHT ANSWER!!!!! You also need to change the batterys A LOT. I am eight, and I do not recomnd this toy."
5,Book purchase review,The book arrived promptly and was in great shape. Why this review requires a certain number of words in order to post it is ridiculous.
1,Pure garbage...tame as hell,"First of all, I've been to some Luke shows back in the early 90's, when you actually knew that he was going to bring the baddest, nastiest freaks with him. Sadly this is no longet the case. I've got Spring Break footage tighter than this, with thighter chicks doing freakier things. Maybe if I was 14 then I would be all over this. Leave this one alone...."
4,"Great TV, except... I sent it back and bought something else","Add my name to the list of customers disappointed with Zenith for shipping products with known defects. The previous review on the Amazon site mentioned the faulty PIP, but I've had great luck with Zenith, and went ahead anyway. I've taken delivery of two of these sets, and today I called to have the second one returned and my money refunded. The PIP didn't work. It's a shame, because I love the TV otherwise. Zenith, get your act together. (see previous review for details)Lance Hall"
4,"PIP Failed, but otherwise","I ALSO had the PIP fail in my unit, in fact - it never worked out of the box. Zenith service sent someone out, they had to haul it away for a few days (couldn't fix it onsite), and I got it back. Worked fine ever since. No other problems. So, only that little annoyance, and I'll give it 4 out of 5."
1,Poor Quality,It seems Zenith has quality control problems they are not dealing with. I bought a Zenith TV which had both a tuner and power supply failure within its short 3 1/2 year life span. The repair was more than the TV was worth! The tuners are junk and the power supplies are inadequate. I also purchased a Zenith DVD player that failed to work right out of the box!
2,Inadequate,"I own several books on nature/landscape drawing, and I'd say this one is the most inadequate in almost every way. I don't mean to be critical, but there's just no way around it. Aside from a couple of sections, this book actually has almost no step-by-step instruction on how to draw something: trees, a barn in a field, for example. It just has a bunch of finished drawings. So if you're looking for actual instruction, I would look elsewhere, although this does have some good info in it. I'd get it used or check it out from the library, though."
2,Frustrating Set Up Hard for kids under 10,"I bought this game along with several other games that our whole family could play (kids ages 6-12). I was looking for games that were fun, and gave younger kids a chance to win as much as older kids/adults. The set up was frustrating. It was very hard to keep the game balanced to get all the pieces on. It took 2 adults. I could not have set this up alone (and I consider myself having good motor skills). My 6 year old had alot of trouble with this game, a hard time getting the ""fork tool"" under the pieces. After playing the game twice it was not a game that made family fun night fun. We won't keep this game in our regular rotation. I bought games like kerplunk, scavenger hunt, hungry hippos, and tumblin monkeys that work alot better for our families age range. I can see the value in the game for working with kids with fine motor skills issues."
3,Too many parts for a kid's game,"I made the mistake of getting this for one of my kids and it lasted about a week before they lost some parts and then it was useless. Looked like fun, but it was not really that much fun for the kids. Too many small parts to keep track of TBH."
4,"Fun game,",My son enjoyed this game. Easy to play. Plastic pieces are constructed well enough that it seems like it will last.
3,Not as nice as the original Tip It game from years ago.,Not as nice as the original Tip It game from years ago. Plastic parts were a little warped. Mattel needs to go back to the old style game. Why would you skimp on PLASTIC ? ? ? ? ?
2,Tip It Review,"We weren't able to use this game because there were pieces missing. When we contacted the maker, they said they were not surprised, because Amazon carries the older version of the game. They are sending us a voucher for a new version of the game available cheaper at Wal Mart. I am NOT a fan of Wal Mart, so I was disappointed with Amazon on this one. Hope the new version is much better!"
3,"Beautiful quilts, but look like paintings in this book.","I would have to agree with the reviewer who wrote that the quilts in this book look more like paintings than like quilts. What I love about the fiber arts and especially quilting is the texture and soft dimension created in the pieces. And I'm always interested in the workmanship, the stitching and piecing and all the intricacies of a quilt, how the artists put everything together. I understand that these quilts are big and you couldn't capture the very small details in a book but I've seen better quality pictures.While many of these quilts are truly beautiful and inspiring, I found myself not giving as much attention to them as I typically would, or being disappointed when I tried to closely examine those quilts that really piqued my interest.I think this book is worth puchasing to see the wonderful creativity of these artists, but if you really want to get a sense of a quilt and see the work in it you might want to make another choice."
3,"Cover was great, pillows were so-so","The service from the sender was great but the actual pillows were just ok.I'm making the cover one now, and though complicated I think it'll be beautiful."
1,Repetitive dialogue irritating!!,"I agree with the other two reviewers who found the dialogue to be very annoying. The same conversion happens over and over, causing me to skip through some of the book to avoid it. The story started off decently enough and had potentional. But then the author brings in Jane's annoying and selfish mother and sisters, and fails to move beyond Jane's denial of Colin's presence for most of the book! Not even the ending can save it. In fact I found the ending to be puzzling (bringing in a character and a story which was not even used to heighten the intrigue and mystery to possibly make the book more interesting) and a let down. This is my first Debra Dier book and I am hesitant to bore myself with another!"
2,"Stop repeating ""I know who I am!!""","This book's plot COULD be developed into an enjoyable story. However, you are 3/4 of the way through the book before the action picks up beyond the two main characters alternately arguing ""I am not a witch"" and ""I know who I am"" Enough is enough! The reader gets the idea after one or two repetitions. Avoid frustration by not reading this book."
3,Hard to believe this is a Debra Dier book.,"I could just say 'ditto' on the other reviews about the repetition of words and actions. I love Debra's time travel romances but not this one. Today I picked up this book, after trying to read it for over a week now, and said to myself ""I'm going to finish this if it kills me"". That right there should tell you that its not the best. On page 259, Jane decides that she won't waste another day denying herself this wonderful man even though he 'has an illness' and from that page to the end (page 360) the book becomes better. Do I recommend it? No."
2,Not What I Expected,"I generally love anything Debra Dier puts on paper but this novel simply amazed me by doing the impossible, I didn't like or particularly care about either of the major characters or the storyline for that matter. And me being a huge fan of time travel -- this story was one even I couldn't believe. Better luck next time."
1,Even the Angels STOP to listen,"K. Vehkavaara's does play games...he plays music that makes you want to dance. Sit down with a Sangria, close your eyes, hit ""PLAY"" and you will soon be transported to Spain. The only thing missing were the dancers."
2,good sleeves,"I think these sleeves are good because they can protect your cards from liquid and other stuff mostly mud maybe. If you don;t like the color there is some green ones but there out of stock right now on October 25, 2005"
1,deck protectors,"Well, i gave it a horrible fun factor because they just aren't fun! They aren't really educational either... But they are very durable, and thats what they are ment for (and protecting the cards!). I recommend these for protectors since they fit Yugioh cards Perfectly.P.S. I HAVE A MAGIC CYLINDERS (Secret Rare)!"
4,choose your color,"it really doesn't make a diffrence to me what color u get but this is a super product for people with younger brothers and sister if u see what mean. these protectors are the BBEESSTT for protecting your cards, and if u really want to be protected like me and buy a tin or a deck box look for my review, i have been from the best on the block to best in town[since my parents will not let me out of the county],but remember if u want to be protected by this product!!!!!!!!!"
1,Not Quite Logical,"It's not a good sign when the very first logic puzzle in a collection called CLASSIC LOGIC PUZZLES is defective! The goal of the first puzzle is to have the reader match up three family members with their respective automobiles. Try as I might, I was unable to completely narrow it down. Swallowing my pride, I then checked the solution in the back of the book. Using logic that escapes me, the author declares that the SUV must belong to the teenage son because this vehicle is brand new. What the?! None of the information provided in the puzzle leads to this conclusion. The author must live in a world where teenage sons always drive new cars! I'm afraid to look at the rest of the puzzles in this book. If any of the other solutions are as non-sensical as this one, I'd rather spare myself the frustration."
2,"Enjoying, but found an error on p. 20 of the problems (out of 174)","Doubting Thomas failed to use ALL the information in the first puzzle. The opening, un-numbered paragraph states that the SUV is new. I also failed to solve that puzzle on my own, but I accepted that I needed to raise my performance to the book's standards, including using all the details given.Faith Harvey is right. The ""Audobon Field Trip"" puzzle presentation gives you seven first names to use in filling eight boxes. This made the puzzle less enjoayble and harder to solve for me because I kept wondering if one of the names was used twice. Nonetheless, I solved the puzzle, leaving one first name blank. The eighth name is mentioned ONLY in the SOLUTION. You can take on the challenge of solving it as is, or you can read on and find the eighth name in every fifth character here: 124S3456U5678S523A7870N7456Anyone have any other errata to share after the Audubon puzzle?Anyone know how to contact any of the authors or editors?"
1,Ditto...,"We have had the same problems with the ""Dream"" Home Theater System. We have learned to mute the sound instead of turning it completely off for the night... it seems that once off, it becomes extremely finicky about turning back on and coming off of the dreaded ""standby."" We inquired about getting it fixed and were quoted approximately $135. I've done my research and will invest in another company's product instead. Don't waste your time on this one."
1,Defective product,"Wish the negative reviews had been on Amazon when our family first purchased 2 of these systems. Even when the product works, it's painfully slow to change & read discs; now both our units have the developed the same problem others have reported, namely getting stuck on ""STANDBY"" instead of turning off, refusing to read DVDs, and getting stuck playing CDs. So yes, it is NOT a fluke, this is a defective product, if you get hold of one and it isn't broken yet, it will be eventually.However, I still use it as a surround sound system, and must admit it sounds pretty good, but I have to plug a cheapo DVD player into an AV input (it only has 2..) to watch DVDs with surround... which is absurd, but I can thank Sony for making this ripoff.And for what it's worth: leaving the system off when not using it seems to improve its longevity."
1,Be Aware!,"Sony isn't what it use to be! BUY THE EXTENDED WARRANTY or PAY for repairs when the manufacture warranty is up. Sony customer service reps state that Sony entertainment systems should last longer than 1 year and 2 weeks, but (& it's a bit one), in the age of ""digital"" to be assured of the unit lasting longer than that, you should purchase the extended warranty (as an insurance policy, just like life insurance for your kids because you never know when they're going to die - really....that was actually said to me by a Sony customer service rep). Also told that Sony is superior quality over ""disposable"" systems that cost less, but what does that matter if the system doesn't work after a year.My conclusion is you might as well buy a cheaper unit and replace every year!"
1,DVD player is unstable,"I bought my unit back in March 2004. A month later, it would no longer play DVDs. I shipped the unit back to Sony at my expense, and about three weeks later I received the repaired unit back. The shipping label mentioned some IC (chip?) repairs done. The unit has played fine for over two months (we dared not attempt playing multiple DVDs). Now the unit is acting up again. This is one of the worst Sony products I have ever purchased. Please stay away from this system."
1,AVOID THIS PRODUCT!,I am on the second system after my first system was replaced. This product has caused constant problems. The system takes DVDs and CDs and does not eject them.
1,Buy this product. Then fill your Xanax prescription.,"Need another source of stress and anxiety in your life? Like the challenge of taming an uncontrollable electronic appliance? Has it been too long since you last payed astronomical late fees to Blockbuster because your DVD player refused to eject a long-overdue disc? Well, have I got a system for you!With the Sony DAV-FC7 Home Theater System, you too can experience entertainment like never before, with a DVD drive that dies a quick and asymptomatic death after only 4 weeks of moderate use, and the warm glow of an eternally blinking ""STANDBY"" display of your soon-to-be-non-responsive system. If that's not enough, you have at your disposal hours of fun with the world's most unintuitive voice response system. Just dial 1-800-222-7669, and let the fun begin.Not recommended if you're pregnant or suffering from a stress-related heart condition. Consult your doctor before purchasing."
1,It is really zero stars,"I wrote a review below, where the unit freezes up and I have to unplug it overnight to make it work. Just an update: Sony has had my unit for a month, can't fix it, and can't send me a new one back because ""We don't have any DVD players"" according to Eric."" And by the way, we can't tell you when you'll get one. I have literally had a broken unit since January, and no estimate when I'll get one. I pay Netflix $20/month for... nothing.Why would you want one of these in your home, when Sony doesn't even have any?Just look at all the reviews below, this is a piece of junk, and the service is beyond horrible. As one Sony customer support person explained to me: ""Mr. Vaughn, life is full of inconveniences"""
1,remove the davfc7 from the market,"In nov 2003 i bought this so called wet dream machine to replace my 10 year old great system. I have had nothing but trouble with this cool looking junk. It wouldnt shut off it wouldnt have the ready sign come on to put c.d or d.v.d. in it.I would always have to shut it off and put it back on. I called sony numerous times and to no avail,they new it was a manufacturers defect, and covered it up. I returned it to circuit city and before they took it, i hope everybody out there does the same as we did. Have them check the defect reports on there computer and find out its been a yugo for so sony that from nov 2003 to now there lemons the store manager told us. If you have to buy anything from circuit city please do it they were great. lets get together and take this crap off the market now."
5,"Finally, a Sony product I can rave about again","You couldn't possibly need more sound than this. ""Sound Fields"" give the options of ""hall"", ""live"" and several Pro Logic DVD surround modes for movies. Tuner, DVD/CD, AMP, a solid woofer with satellite speakers that have a great mid-range, for under 500 bucks. TEN times better than the Bose 5.1 system at a 1/3 the price. And it's all-in-one. If your in the market, look no further..I happen to love Techno, and it has never sounded better."
4,Great Quality for its price,"Many reviews have been slamming this system, but I have had this for 2 years now and not one problem. Let's be honest, this isn't a top of the line system but you're not paying for one either. For the price, the picture and sound quality is excellent. It make watching movies a great experience. For the people that have defective ones, that sucks, but for those who complain about the picture and sound quality, maybe you should get a better TV, or spend more that $400 buck if you want perfection. Don't complain if you buy a car for $500 bucks and expect it to run like a $30,000 car.Downfalls - set length on speaker wire. Slow disc ejects/changes."
2,remote control,"i just got thism system dav-fc7. set up was easy but the store didnt tell what other cables i needed. easy to use but i have one problem. i didn't investihgate or was told by the store that thee remote commaner is not universal, so it will only run the system and the tv. i also have a satellite box and a vcr so i have to use 2 remotes. i don't like that and contacting sony by email and phone were horrible if they even answerd my quesstion. i evem purcjased another sony universal remote that is supossed to work any sony component right out of the box. it din't and the original renmote will not let anyotheer remote learn from it. this is a consciprary on sony part and this syystem is going back to the store..final quote don't buy sony their customer service has a lot to be desired."
2,Its great until it stops working!,I didn't find out that this system has the same problem for everybody until it stopped working. It was great until then.
1,Don't Buy - unless gift for Ex-wife,"Sounds like a broken record about this machine - but when powered on the DVD display blinks twice and then goes blank. At this time and for some time later (maybe days or weeks) the DVD function won't work - no eject, no insert - no play!!If you want one, I will sell you mine - certified not to be working on arrival."
2,Hello....Recall please,"I can't believe that Sony has not done something about this. Our system has the same CD and power problems! I have already mounted the speakers on the walls and would love to just replace the unit with something compatible. I used to always buy Sony products but after this piece of junk, I'm looking elsewhere for dependable electronics"
1,zero star - Worst Sony Equipment I ever had,"Sony's lacks quality. This system never switches off, keeps flashing ""Standby"". I have seen this happening every shop I visited. Still these shops sell these equipments!!And more over, this is my third bad experience from Sony.1. Wega TV - Broke in two days2. Home Theater - Broke in week3. Sony DSC-P3 digital camera - Came defective(lens won't pop out).All these broke within a matter of first day or in a week.I have decided not to purchase any more Sony equipments/gadets unless really improve their quality.I sold this item and purchased Onkyo(SR502B)/Bose(AM6) combination. Wow..What a quality and sound!!"
2,Nice but too many details wrong,"Overall the system is nice: it sounds fine for a low end system and the picture quality is fine. But I hate using it as a CD player. It takes forever to switch between disks, about 30 seconds. Loading or ejecting a disk take even longer. There is no way to tell what disks are loaded in the machine, and you cannot change one disk while it is playing another. These seem like minor things, but when you walk in to the room and turn on the stereo to listen to some music they add up to a 5 minute delay before you are actually listening to anything. Bleh. If I had it to do over I would get a system like my older one that just has a big tray instead of the fancy slot loader. I guess the people at Sony put looks ahead of function on this one."
1,CR@P CR@P CR@P,"I'm sorry to say that I too have seen the 'standby' glitch but in the past I was able to unplug the system and power it back on to fix the problem. UNTIL TODAYNow when I power on the system it flashes 'DVD' for a second, then goes blank. I cannot eject or insert a DVD. No display on the TV. But the FM tuner and audio inputs still work.This system cost me $400 2.5 years ago. I was never thrilled with it - sound is ok, but no Treble/Bass or EQ adjustment is available.It also takes forever to switch between disks, maybe an acceptable sacrifice for such a sleek system.. but now it no longer functions for me.Not that anyone is going to be buying these new anymore. Just steer clear!"
5,awsome,"whats up? i'm a teen, and this video is totally awsome. The actors are incredible, especially the star, milo.... damn he if fine.... i could just eat him up!! haha, j/k, i'd rather do other things to him. Trust me, you will love this video, its very cool. i promise. enjoy!!!!!! <peaceout>"
2,Low Quality even for the price,These files are the lowest quality I have ever seen. The points are blunt the edges are fat. The working surface is coarse which is not in itself a defect but should have been disclosed.
3,Bought for 7 Year Old,"My 7 year old daughter likes this because she is such a Lizzie fan, however, I think it is suited better for preteens who can think on their feet faster."
4,good buy,Bought this book because it was recommended to me. Nothing in the book is that hard. what I enjoyed about it are the meal plans and the nutritional values of items and also that there are recipes for a range of stages than just 'baby' or 'toddler' it's got both. worth the buy.
5,Great mommy help!,This book is great! I wanted to make my son's baby food instead of buying it at the store and this book helped me out so much in the actual selection of the food and how to make it. I use it all the time.
5,Simple and Enjoyable Solution,"'Superfoods for Babies and Children' is a life-saver in my quest for quick, simple, and tasty recipes that our son would enjoy eating. Thank you, Annabel!I love to cook (and eat), but was having a hard time cooking meals that our picky 2-year-old son would enjoy. He literally, used to run the opposite direction, whenever I would offer him food; and, almost stopped eating because he was tired of plain vegetables, fruits, mac 'n cheese, hot dogs, cereal, and of course, pizza 3 days in a row.The recipes are about one paragraph only, can't get easier than that. So easy that I look forward to preparing our son's meals, knowing that he is going to eat healthy and have a variety. In time, when he is ready, and out of the picky-eating stage, I hope that this transition will help him to enjoy Mommy and Daddy's foods too.I've just ordered two more books and hope that the 'Lunchbox' and 'Family' editions are just as wonderful."
5,"""Choke"" full of info","I was pleased to find a book that gave me everything I wanted and then some... organic food cost and nutritional value vs bland, nutrient, lacking jared food; the courage to make the effort to prepare homemade food, the nutritional breakdown of foods esp. protein because of concerns of feeding meat to a child before he aquires molars to properly chew. I will use this as my bible for my 29 week premmie and his future sibilings. The one thing I found missing was information on the nutritional benefits and values of goats milk as an excellent milk alternative. Recommend to any mom. Enjoy !!!"
3,In a perfect world...,"I would have loved this book. But, I was given a very picky eater and she would not eat half of the stuff in there. So, I wasn't able to make much from it."
2,disappointed and confused,"The book has lots of recipies that aren't very practical to me. I also found some inconcisistencies with her reccomendations for not giving infants certain foods like wheat - and then having a recipie for an infant that included pasta (ie, wheat).After just looking through the book, I don't plan to use it at all."
3,overdone,"I just thought this book had less content than glossy pictures and recipes included ingredients not normally found in one's cupboard. I gave this as a gift, but would look for something more ""parent"" friendly and easier to use in the future. Also takes up much bookshelf space for the amount of use it will probably get."
4,"Good Ideas, Questionable content","First the good: It's a good starter book for ideas..It didn't occur to me to saute chicken with onions, celery and garlic then puree for my son...so this is more than just a ""puree peaches, then serve"" kind of book. There is some of that but also actual dishes I would prepare for myself. I also REALLY liked that each recipe indicated if the food was suitable for freezing--important to me for the convenience.Then the bad: Many of the recipes include foods that are HIGHLY allergenic-strawberries, peanuts/peanut butter, wheat. SHe does mention that these are allergenic but in the back AFTER the nutrition introduction and recipies, a place where it could be easily missed."
3,Redundant,"I simultaneously purchased this book and two others by Ms. Karmel. There are great recipes in all three; however, some of the same recipes are repeated in each book. Had I known that, perhaps I would only have purchased the one for infant recipes and the one for family recipes and not this one that's kind of 'in the middle' of the spectrum."
3,Nice variety,"This book provides an interesting selection of meals for your baby. I've purchased it originally to cook first purees for my newborn, and still waiting until she's old enough to eat solids. However, the book also provides recipes for toddlers and older children, and I haven't found a recipe that I could imagine my 2-year-old eat. He's very picky and simpler meal recipes would do us more good. I'd look for something else if I would purchase a cookbook for babies and children."
3,"Ok, but not for babies.",This book has a lot of good ideas for children over 18 months. The sections on first foods are full of misinformation and contradictions.
2,Frida Kahlo: An Open Life,"It's an interesting subject, but I found the book to be quite confusing. It skips around chronologically and often fails to explain fully the events that are mentioned. In addition, the translation is quite awkward in places. I would presume that the translator was attempting to preserve the flavor of the original, but she does so in a way that interferes with comprehension."
2,Just barely OK....,"I like Joseph Mazzello a lot (he's a great young actor!), but I have to say that this movie stunk! It's basically about a kid with no friends who hides his identity and finds courage in a robot-like cyber suit from another world and becomes a super hero. I mean, it's not the WORST movie I've ever seen, but definitely not the BEST or even close to it. The acting is pretty OK, but most of it is a little cheesy. Star Kid is more for our younger audiences than older audiences. I rented this video and I can say that renting it once was enough for me! I've seen all of Joseph Mazzello's movies, and I have to say that his other ones are better. If you're a Joseph Mazzello fan, skip this one and pick up The Cure, Jurassic Park, Simon Birch, or The River Wild. Watching this movie once should be enough! Very disappointed."
4,Good Family Movie,Very good for the whole family to see. Has some comedy in it as well as drama. This little boy learns a lot about himself and his family when he finds and uses this robot suit
3,I LIKE FOR SOME REASON,I NOW ALOT OF YOU GUYS HATE THIS MOVIE BUT FOR SOME REASON I LIKE IT. JOSEPH MAKES YOUU CARE ABOUT HIS CHACTER. BUT THE EFFECTS WERE PRETTY CHEESY.
2,THIS IS ONE CRAPPY MOVIE!,"I may like Joseph Mazzelo but,this movie really stunk.It has no plot and horrible special effects. If you like Sci-fi movies stay away from this one!"
1,Good and Bad...,"Joseph Mazzello is a great young actor, but this movie was WAY below par for his filmography. This movie is great if you're younger than 12 years old and like silly sci-fi, but otherwise leave it on the shelf."
5,Great Kids Action Movie,"First saw this when I was a kid and just recently found it on Amazon. Must have for Kids. Great action, cool story, good special effects for the time and just an all around wholesome and fun flick."
5,Kirby video scores again,This is another Kirby platform video game that is fun for all ages. Gradually work through the different level to gain more skills for Kirby. LOVE IT!!!!!
4,this game rocks!,this game is terrific the last time i played i thought i'd die from laughter at hw silly this was its fun
1,I was sent the wrong item and it was never corrected!!!!,Instead of the Shirley Temple CD that I ordered some foreign title came in the mail. I immediately put it back in the box and sent it back. Since then I have not heard from the company nor did I recieve the correct item or any credit for the incorrect item. I will never order from this store on Amazon again.
4,A Grandson's search for his grandfather,"Emeric Pressburger was a fascinating man. A Hungarian Jewexiled during WWII he came to England and (together withMichael Powell) made some of the most fascinating andinfluential movies of the period.This is the story of how Kevin MacDonald followed hisGrandfather's path through Europe and how and why anon-native speaker could finish up being one of thebest observers of the English.Emeric Pressburger often showed a deep understanding ofthe British that is only granted to those ""outside, lookingin"". He always prided himself on being ""more English thanthe English"". After all, some of use were just BORN English,but he CHOSE to become English."
5,Family fun!,"My son received this as a gift on his 9th birthday. Not only has he enjoyed it tremendously, but his father and I also play it a lot. Reminiscent of ""Skee-Ball"" but with electronic sounds and lights. Highly recommended."
4,"Fun, Fun, Fun!!!!","When I got this toy I played it non-stop. I love it. My only complaint is, it's too noisy and loud. Even while the volume is low, it is still very loud. Bullz-Eye-Ball is a lot of fun though! My highest score on the 30-second blitz is 94. This toy reminds me of ski-ball and I love ski-ball, so this toy is fantastic."
5,For parents too!,Buy this for your kids so that you will be able to play. My husband and I are having as much fun as they are playing this highly adictive game. You really can't stop yourself. It promotes great hand/eye coordination and your kids will have to concentrate on what they are doing. I would advise playing it while sitting on a rug. This will keep the balls from flying all over when you miss. You can order replacement balls from the company.
4,good toy,"ok,so here is the scoop,my little brother got the for his 8th b-day,he love's it,but you gotta be carefull,it's trickier than it look's,you have ten ball's,and a tramp(the yellow pad)and you have top bounce the balls onto the tramp,and into the hole's,the bottom hole is 1 point,the middle hole is 2 points,and the top is 3 points,you gotta be quick 'cause you only have 30 seconds.here is a downside,when you bounce the balls on the teamp sometimes they bounce another direction.You also have another game(i don't know what it is),and bullz eye ace,you have to get as many top targets as you can,without gettingand middle and\or bottom targets.but yet still this is a good game."
5,One of the best!!!,"This is one of the best games my children ever asked for. It is addicting! From my 7 year old to myself and my husband, we all enjoy it. We are constantly in competition for highest scores! People that complain about ""losing balls"" or ""stepping on balls"" should just be more careful. That's a really silly complaint. It's a great toy and I would highly recommend it."
1,Where are the balls?!,"The game is fun at first but gets VERY boaring VERY fast. I agree with everything M.Borous wrote about Bulls Eye Ball. One thing that I really got frustrated with is the tiny silver balls. Problem #1: when you score the balls are sopposed to roll down a slope and into this little area to hold them, but they always get stuck. Probem #2: The balls are about the size of the end of a push pin (the non-pointy end) and EASILY get lost. I only have one ball left! If I could I would give this toy -5 stars. HORRIBLE TOY!!! DON""T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!!!!!! Jacks, pool, skeeball, or ANY GAME IS MORE FUN THAN THIS!!!!!!!!"
2,Not that great,"I dont know why this toy got such good reviews. Its so boring. when I bounced the ball on the fabric it always goes to the side this game is boring if you want something like this go to Ocean City, New Jersey, get on the boardwalk, go to Jilly's Arcade, and play skeeball for 10 cents. (MUCH BETTER AND CHEAPER!!!!!)"
3,super fun but....,this toy is super fun!! i had soo much fun playing with it as soon as i got home. (my high score is 68!) but the only bad thing as that the little metal balls go EVERYWHERE!! if u make a bad shot the ball will miss the target and roll of the table! Me and my mom played it and we both loved it but it got soooo fustrating when all the balls rolled off the table. this toy is fun but unless you want the balls rolling everywhere then i wouldnt recomend it.
4,Bullz-Eye!,"Great sleeper present of the holidays. Unassuming and similar in look to Skee-Ball, but it's packed with more compulsion and mania. The three game settings compliment each other well and test players' stamina, speed and accuracy. Fun toy for all ages and genders, and it's certainly competitive and addictive, as you can see customers posting their scores even on the reviews! That's a sign of a fun game- For us, 141 was the high-score for 30-Second Blitz; 4.2 seconds was the fastest 25-Point Rush; 20 was the best score for the Bullz Eye Ace. You'll play til your fingers ache."
4,Life of the party,This was a hit as a gift to my 30 year old niece and her husband. They said it would be great for their game night parties!
3,"Good party favor for the younger, crazy croud.. most guys will like these no matter how old.","These bands make a good party favor if you are in your 20's or 30's. Some people may be really offended by the titles on these though... [...]. I think they are funny, but I decided not to give these as a gift. I like the Fred Beer bands that say ""Mine"" better. You can keep track of your beer by the color only. They are a bit hard to slip on your bottle as well. (which can be a pain if you drink fast) :)"
4,Product is GREAT!.. though not the style I ordered..,"Looking for a unique gift?.. cool party favors?.. Fred's Beerbands are it!So here's the thing.. I bought this as a birthday gift.. the item/idea is spectacular.. the durability is great too.. I wanted the ones with personality traits.. and instead I received the ones that are 10 ""Drunk"" bands and 2 ""Driver"" bands.. The gift was still a huge hit.. but I knew the personality traits would have been that much better!!"
3,"Great, until you use them!","I bought these for a friend's party and we broke them out that night. Everyone seemed to enjoy them, and they all ended up shuffled around on the several cases of beer we had around. By the end of the night, we noticed that a few of them were already worn (most likely from the condensation), and the letters were wiped either completely or partially away. It's possible we got a bad batch, however I doubt it. The ""Polluted"" band now only says ""uted"". Pretty disappointing. As these were a gift, I don't think I'll be sending them back. They're cheap enough as a one time fling, so it's your call."
1,Junk! Don't bother. Customer Service is the worst EVER,"LCD started to fade after the Winter. Only owned for 5 months and the LCD barely comes on. My first reaction was to put new batteries in, however, that did not work. So I called customer service, sigh. They told me my brand new Energizer batteries with an expiration date of 2014 was TOO OLD. They said the batteries I purchased were already too old to work properly. So apparently, if you are unable to buy batteries produced in the future, these devices will never work properly. I almost rather they just said ""wrong company"" and hung up then this lame lie."
1,poor accuracy,"My unit is installed on the outside of a north-facing well-insulated window so the sun and indoor heat are not affecting the unit. Regardless of this, the temperature always reads 7 to 10 degrees warmer than the actual. I installed a new battery but still is not accurate. This is too large a difference to accept, and like another reviewer said, returning it to the manufacturer is not pratical due to shipping cost. Also, you can't read it when it's dark outside, even if you shine a light on it from inside of house. I like to see the early morning temperature during winter when it is still dark outside. I would not recommend it and am going to try a wired unit instead."
1,"Yeah, I wasted my money. Do yourself a favor and dont' buy this.","This would only be good in the shade, on a piece of glass that's not attached to your house (or anything else that might exude heat), and with a medium lit backdrop during the day (forget about reading it when it's dark outside). The other day it was 58 degrees out and this little fellow read 89 degrees. NOT EVEN CLOSE! Buy something you can mount on a fence or wall outside the house, or one of those units with a radio link to a remote thermometer."
3,Small but OK,"I like this thermometer for its low price while recording the high and low for the 24-hour period. It is awfully SMALL, but workable. Seems to me I had to go to the La Crosse site to find out the size. It didn't occur to me in advance - the numbers are not readable when it is night and there is no outside light to act as contrast to the dark numbers. I still find it useful, but if you want to be able to read the outdoor temp AT NIGHT, this thermometer isn't the trick."
3,Time function MIA and doesn't work well over 102 F,"I live in Phoenix, and this thermometer seems to crap out in the higher temperatures. The news (and my skin) will tell me it's 113, yet my thermometer says its 102. Also, the instructions seemed to be for a different model, as the buttons are in different places than in the diagram, and also the directions indicate there is a time function that doesn't seem to exist. If you just want to know the temperature and you live in a temperate climate, then you will be more satisfied with this product than I was."
2,Disappointed,Be carful where you place it...MUST be put in a shady place or it reads crazy! Hard to read if sun is hitting it and obviously can't be seen at night.
1,Won't work in cold climates...reads too high,I put the thermometer in a north facing dual pane insulated window and just above pleated insulating shade...reads 8-10 degrees too high when temp in 40's...probably more inaccurate at lower temps. I'm going to leave it up to see if it is worth anything in summer weather.
1,Inaccurate Thermometer,"I just returned the two that arrived last week. One arrived with a dead battery. Both were very inaccurate, indicating consistent temperatures of at least 10 degrees too high. The thermometer look good but definatly not worth the trouble"
5,Pleasure and pulse,having lived in Beijing from 97-2000 and having had the pleasure of not only owning a CD and VCD of the live performance(at the time of course the band was still not allowed to play together before a large audience)I would go through the Freindship store (government owned stores) and one day someone had put the live vcd on and attracted about 5 people and for the following three days it grew to 20 when one of the employees turned it off and chewed out the other people for putting in on. So of course I bought it. We had the band play at the 4th of July cellebration and you could hear at least one of them weekly on a drop in at a great place called the CD cafe. Have not been able to get this CD but will keep trying. One of the greatest bands and Cui has fronted for the likes of Peter Gabriel and the like. Not as heave as Tang Dynasty but a great band. The Bob Dylan of China
4,I enjoyed it,"...I am not much an ""alternative"" (relative to Chinese pop) music buff, but I am very moved by Cui's lyrics. The Slacker was a very original piece of art when it first came out, at a time the nation was first open to the world and there was a huge upswing of national pyschic. The lyric cried for acceptance: a pathetic, desperate loser was suddenly accepted by pure passion. We can hear this romance of tragic in many of his other works. His other lyrics/works are just as powerful. The unsupress-able calling for cultural mutation certainly sealed his fate in China today. Sigh ..."
4,"Good ""JUKE BOX"" Style CD Player","I am happy this 100 + 1 CD Juke Box style player overall. It plays really well & I have had no mechanical problems thus far. It is somewhat cumbersome to program & I have to refer back to the manual not infrequently. But in general this a nice unit & I am glad I have it, the remote is easy to use once you understand what you are trying to accomplish from the directions."
4,Fine Cajun music,This man is my cajun squeezebox hero. If you are down just listen to this and you can not help but be cheered up.
3,"Has defect, but can be fixed.",When I first got my DVD player. I could not play any of the dual layered disk wiht out some sort of problem. But i called them and they told me send it back to have it upgraded. Since I got it back it has played relatively fine. 1 star for product quality. and 4 stars for customer service.
5,A Great Value and Easy Hookup,"This is a great buy for anyone that wants a good basic DVD player. I hooked it up in minutes without any problem. Zenith has stated why there is a problem with ""The Matrix"" so I don't see why anyone should hesitate buying this player. I am very pleased!"
3,Good....but has this problem......,"BE WARNED! ! ! Like some of the other reviews, I too knew something was wrong. I bought several new DVD's (Matrix, 13th Floor, You Got Mail,etc.) and they wouldn't work, older ones work fine, then found out it's the player. VERY ANNOYING!BUT....I do like the features, being able to change screen size & audio while movies are playing, being able mark up to 6 different spots to replay, fast forward doesn't ""skip"" through, all on the user friendly remote. These things aren't as good or friendly on my Toshiba SD-3109, that I got to repalce the Zenith. But the Toshiba plays all DVD's......so I kept both."
2,Okay - until The Abyss,"I received this DVD Player as a Christmas gift & I was so excited to use it. I watched numerous DVD's & was just so happy until...The Abyss came out on DVD. It is my one of my favorite movies & I couldn't wait to watch it on DVD. But alas, it would not play. I actually thought it was the DVD & took it back to the store. Then I tried the new DVD - same thing. I called Circuit City. They told me it would need an upgrade & that they would send it back to the manufacturer FREE OF CHARGE. Well wasn't that nice of them to offer. Seeing that it was a manufacturer defect and all. So now I have to send it back. I haven't done it yet - but will do it this week. But I really didn't want to go through the unhooking & re-hooking of my system.Avoid this product."
5,Great Price - Excellent Picture,"Just recieved this one. The picture is better than any other I have seen It has many surprise features like the resume button on the remote. I am very happy with this on. No problems with movies (The Mummy, Bad Boys). I would buy it again!"
3,It worked...,"The experience I had with the DVD2200 was a little different than the other reviews. The player played movies fine, good crisp image and sound, and no flicering like the other reviewer noticed. However, I decided not to keep it because throughout almost every movie, the player would ""freeze"" about 5 or 6 times for about a second or two. It was pretty annoying. I would recommend just forking out the extra 30 bucks and getting a better one."
2,Stay away from this one...,"The player overall doesn't measure up to any of the recent Toshiba or Panasonic players. The video quality is somewhat poor due to a massive amount of flickering throughout any movie. I don't even want to know what will happen when I put in Matrix later today. On a good note, I do like the nice green color of the text on the player, and the remote is above average for an entry level player. My advice: add the extra $70 or so and go for the Toshiba SD2109!"
1,Had to return this product,"Its hard for me to rate this unit since I was never able to watch a movie all the way through. It kept freezing up and skipping and stopping completely. Maybe I just got a Lemon, who knows? Anyway, Amazon is great and had no problem with my return."
4,ZENTIH WILL MODIFY THIS UNIT..FOR FREE!,"PLEASE SEE Addressing consumer concerns about Zenith DVD above this section. It is a proven fact that the issues with DVD's is a problem on the DISC itself. Zentih will modify the unit FREE, to allow the unit to deal with these badly recorded DVD's!By the way, this is an excellent player at an excellent price."
1,Zenith DVD-Player DVD2200 - BE WARNED!,"I purchased player 6/30/99. It's assembly date states April 1999. I now come to find out player will not play newer and some future DVD movie releases. Zenith is aware of problem but is unwilling to recall. E,G,. The Sci-Fi Movie ""MATRIX"" cannot be played in this machine. Per retailer (where purchased) other movie titles are likely to have same problem. Zenith using old LASER Tecnology and is unwilling to correct problem, even on new purchases. BE WARNED! DO NOT PURCHASE!"
1,Zenith DVD2200,"(The one star is misleading: I tried to score it with zero stars, but the system wouldn't permit it.) The DVD was defective. Save yourself some time and aggravation and give this DVD2200 a miss."
4,So Far So Good,"At first I was reluctant to purchase this product, but I have a Zenith TV which has worked without a glitch for 3 years so I took the plunge into the digital age. The value for the money is great. I have watched many movies on this unit and have had no problems so far. My unit is actually the DVC2200, which is a newer version of this product. I have a receiver that is nearly 10 years old and speakers nearly 20 years old and have noticed a great improvement in sound quality. I can't wait to upgrade these so that I can get a true ""home theater"" experience! Very pleased so far and would recommend to anyone on a budget."
5,"Great Show, Great Girls Great Music....This is Heaven!","Luke has shown us girls, bikinis and wild action and it simply gets better each time. If you think you've seen all that there is to see about wild parties, tight bodies and crazy people...think again! After watching this video you'll agree that Luke's raised the bar yet again. This IS the Best!"
1,what happened to Adam's sisters??,"With all of his sisters well married, why was Adam and his parents still poor? Would not any of his brother-in-laws help their wives family? Even today one can expect to take care of ones parents to some degree. Would not one of these men have stepped in to address the issue of Adam's career since being a vicar was not a welcome vocation? It does not make any sense. Besides, Emma is a drag. Why do regency authors think that regency misses involved in ridiculous, stupid situations and behave as though they are just plain dumb are seen as smart and spunky? I have read a few of Ms. Henrickson's books in the past, but this was a disappointing read."
4,HoMedics QRM-400 Quad Roller Massaging Cushion,"The product was delivered promptly as advertised. Its structure is solid, and seems durable. The massage rollers work well for relaxing the back muscles, but do not quite reach the top of the back. The control unit is easy to understand and use. Overall I am happy with the product."
4,"feels good, But","QRM 400 is very well made and should hold up for years. The rollers feel great I just wish they went higher up to reach between my shoulders blades (I'm only 5'5""). It is great on low & mid back. I still feel it is worth the money. I use it every day!"
2,Not what I hoped for,"It's much shorter than it should be. As a result, it really can't massage the upper back. Otherwise a good product. I would recommend for someone 5'5 or shorter."
3,Great while it worked,"I found this product very effective for relieving muscle tension. It was better for upper back than lower -- didn't really reach that low, and I am 5'6"". The product had a faulty cord and would stop / resume operation if the cord was jiggled. Now after 8 months, it has completely stopped working. I am contacting Homedics to see if they can help me as it should be under warranty. It would be great if Homedics could produce this with better quality, and quieter. The noise is enough to interfere with hearing the TV if your volume is low. If the unit was not defective and quieter, I would give it 4 stars."
4,Good massage if you can stand the pain,"This portable cushion resides on our reclining chair and is used when my husband has a sore back. It is fairly painful, but if you stick it out for over 15 minutes it does relieve back pain. My husband uses it about every other day."
5,Very happy back!,This is very nice. The Shiatsu massager works into your back much better than the plain massagers. Very happy with this purchase.
3,HoMedics QRM-400 Quad Roller Massaging Cushion,"I when I bought the unit I really had high hopes for it to relieve a lot of my back strain and sore muscles. I found the unit to be a little too rough on the back and had to sit completely upright and not put hardly any pressure against it in order to make it work better. You could never use it leaning back in a lounge chair because it would be too much pressure. Also, it did not cover the upper shoulder region and neck area like I hoped and where you usually need the most relief. To compensate you have to lean way back dropping your shoulders so they contact the rollers. It's a great concept, but will never replace the real thing."
3,Useful,"I found the QRM-400 model somewhat effective. Unlike a similar model we had purchased from Costco, it doesn't have a vibrator for the thighs...I also found this model lacking in the power dept. with regards to my neck and in producing a painfully deep massage of the back it's other prototype was able to deliver...sorry, can't remember the other model number."
2,"Skip this one, but stick w/ homedics shiatsu","I have a cheaper version of this that only has two rollers and less programing options. I bought this upgrade for my brother's birthday and was disappointed. It doesn't feel as good as my cheaper one.The extra expense is wasted partly on lighted rollers. Yes, they look neat when the thing is on and toddlers will be intrigued. However, I have to ask: Why do we need lighted rollers that we are going to be leaning back on?"
4,HoMedics QRM-400 Roller massaging Coushion/Shiatsu Massage,"I have asthma and my back (where my lungs are) is always hurting or sore....I purchased this about 3 weeks ago and I must say that I use it for 30 mins each day....As a vocolist I cannot afford any aches anywhere and BOY! am I nice and relaxed after a session with this massager....I like the fact that I'm able to focus the massaging on one area :-)...If you like a deep massage, the Shiatsu setting is the ticket :-)...I would suggest this to anyone :-)..."
2,Not what I expected ...,"Purchased the barebones 200 model from K-Mart for Christmas and was blown away by it's performance. Thought, ""this must be better - newer model and nearly twice the price"" and was WRONG! You can barely feel this one and the back and forth motion is more annoying than relaxing. Save your money and use a wooden back-scratcher."
1,not good,"This massager s definately not worth of money, i suggest you to go to bed bath and beyond and buy try this massager first.this massager is not a massager it is just a set of four rollers that rolls on your back, thats it. homedics has a vibrator massager with handle and is of 50 bucks, believe thats much more relaxing then this massager."
3,Homedics QRM-400 Quad roller.,"Got this product after reading review. It's ok I guess. It wasn't strong enough a massage.HoMedics PA-100 Therapist Select Percussion Massager, Variable Speedis better if you can get someone to help for the difficult to reach places"
3,Massage chair is ok...,"Its not what I wanted. You should just pay more and get a better model cause this one isn't all that. If its lower back pain you want to solve, get the back2life machine. Its the best thing ever and a must have for every athlete and average Joe as well. It will change your life as it changed mine. Take it from a former US MARINE."
3,SBM-300 better than QRM-400,"I bought both the SBM-300 and QRM-400. Although the QRM-400 looks better with the black vinyl and blue lights, the SBM-300 is a much better massager and is cheaper. The rollers on the QRM-400 essentially swivel back and forth and roll up and down your back. The SMB-400 rollers spin and roll up and down your back. My wife, I, and 14 year old son compared both and all three of us determined the SBM-300 did a better massage for us."
5,Great product,"I have lusted after a $3000 panasonic massage chair for years and can't afford it. This is the first unit I have tried that gave an almost identical massage, for a fraction of the price. I am an RN who does pain releif therapy and not only have one of these units myself I recommend it to my clients. Interestingly, it has dramatically helped my bone-on-bone knee pain, since when my back is in better alignment my knees don't hurt as much. I rarely get back aches but when I have ""overdone"" my bending, etc., activities, this takes the discomfort away immediately. Definitely a keeper."
2,Loved it while it lasted,"I truly loved this item until it quit 6 months after my husband bought it for me. I sent it back which cost me $42.00 only to receive a ""new"" replacemnt that lasted two weeks. Will I spend another $42.00 to send it back? NO WAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Good luck with your HoMedic Model QRM-400. Hope it last longer than mine."
3,Not as great as 300,Well the QRM 400 looks better than the last model but the 300 had more of a kick to it!
3,so-so,The stitching fell apart and ripped after only a week or two of normal use. Expected more for the price.
1,Oversized Back,"This item works well but it's back part is so large that it uses up all he space of the chair i place it on. The back is about 5"" deep, it makes me sit on the edge of the seat which is pretty uncomfortable. If you were putting it on a couch or something with more room it would be ok, but for an office chair its lousy"
3,Could use some improvements,"I'm thrilled to have this massager, but........I'm a little disappointed too. I'm only 5'5"", but the rollers don't come close to my shoulders, only as far as my shoulder blades. I have since bought a smaller item to use specifically on my neck and shoulders. (Yet something else to lug around and plug in!) And beware: the Shiatsu rollers and knobs are rough if you don't use a folded towel on it. I was really sore (felt bruised!) after using it the first time. I've not tried the other models, so I can't make a comparison."
5,An absolutely great product.,"Truly a great massager. Only thing I've ever seen to really work and keep my wife's attention.Only complaint might be to make it a little taller, but you can always slouch to massage your upper back. Considering the price it is absoultely well worth it."
4,Great Massager,"This has alleviated my upper back pain. The shiatsu mode is a little rough on you but put a towel over it and it's much better. The only improvements I would make would be to add heat, and have the blue leds turn off when the unit is off."
4,Good buy,"I read many of the reviews prior to purchase and bought this product anyway. One person expressed it clearly stating something to the fact of it has a great demo mode, but no way to combine the rolling and shaitsu any other time. That is my one criticism of the product. The size and weight are fine and the lights are not bright if you use the cover provided. I would suggest unplugging the unit after each use so the lights don't burn out."
4,Great Massage Cushion,I purchased this for my husband. He uses it often and commented that he thinks it is great for his back. He is used to getting professional massages to ease the stress and tension in his back - since using the HoMedics Cushion he has not had a need for a professional massage! So its like the Cushion has already paid for itself.I highly recommend this product.
5,Great massage,"We gave this to my daughter's family for Christmas. She's a physical therapist and had tried this out while waiting at a pharmacy and was impressed. They all loved it, were waiting impatiently to have a turn at using it. Only drawback is that they're all tall, and it doesn't go quite high enough."
3,HoMedics QRM-400 w/ heat.,"The cushion looks great, but you can't use the heat alone. The rollers don't penatrate the back as much as I would like and it is also louder than expected."
4,Liquidmetal 150,"I used Head squash racquet for more than 14 years, they manufactured a lot of great racquets with new technologies. The Liquidmetal is the new technology for 05/06 Head's racquet, I have a LM 140 (after 1 year of average usage, the racquet is cracked open at the top) before I bought this LM 150. The LM 140 is more powerful than the LM 150, but the LM 150 gets more control and feels lighter than LM 140. You can swing faster and pick up some shots that you can't before. Overall, it is a light, quick racquet.For 2006 Head has a new technology - Flexpoint come out. But 2 of my friends broke their Flexpoint 130 & 140 in 2 weeks. For 2007 they have a new design call Flexpoint Metallix. It only has one racquet for 150 gram. They say you will get power, control & everything from this racquet. Hopefully, it is an improvement from the old Flexpoint series and I have a very high expectation on this one."
2,"works, but unreliable","Had my alarm installer put one in my Viper system. Worked well for about 1 year, then, of course, with the warranty done, the siren malfunctioned (see previous reviews of people with this problem also). Thankfully it was inexpensive, so I purchased another, and will keep my fingers crossed. The horn is quite a bit louder than the stock horn that comes with the alarm itself, so I am giving it another chance... so far, not impressed with DEI electronics, as I have a window module that may be faulty as well..."
1,Malfunctioned after 1 year (Had to be destroyed to silence),Came back to car with siren blaring and could not turn off even with siren's key. The actual car alarm may not even have been triggered. Drove it home with siren screaming and killed siren with a screw driver and pliers (caused some smoke). The siren's key really needs to forcefully cut power.
4,hearing is believing,"Because the approach of this splendid CD is so straightforward, its value may best be explained by a first-person account of a user.I've been enjoying backyard birds in my home in Costa Rica and now in Indiana for many years. Yet I've only rarely felt confident about linking a bird's song to its appearance. I guess I'm a visual guy. Birdsong sounded good but taught me almost nothing.Then a helpful attendant in a Wild Birds Unlimited store steered me towards this Peterson Field Guides cd. I'm an admirer of the Peterson Field Guide books, so this was an easy sale.Since then I've listened through the guide three or four times in my car. Already, I find my ears picking up on a particular birdsong when I'm not even paying attention. Typically, I look up and - mirabile dictu - there's the bird I've learned, almost unconsciously, to identify by its song before it appears before the eye.That's good pedagogy. This is a good product.Cheep. Cheep. And so much more."
5,PAIN RELIEF,THIS PRODUCT HANDLES MY ARTHRITIS PAIN WITH EASE. ONE TABLET IN THE MORNING AND ONE WITH THE EVENING MEAL KEEPS ME GOING PAIN FREE.
5,Whec OC'd equal to GTX,"Well this really good card, OC the core to 620 and memory to 950 and runs without problem. Using ATITOOL 0.27 which is compatible with Vista and way more stable then ntune. At this speed performance are equal to GTX"
3,"Looks nice, but only marginally effective","I have mixed thoughts on my review so I'll cut right to the weakness of this Marble Wine Chiller: it doesn't stay cold for long and even then, does not keep bottles cold very well. That said, I still find it a very usable product for my reds that I pull from my wine fridge, but it only has enough thermal mass to stave off the heat for 1 hour or so. That's often long enough, but this will not bring a full bottle of red wine down to a drinkable temperature, let alone chilling any white. I drink 75% reds, and use this cooler most of the time I open a bottle. But I usually find my bottles warming up before long.So, I'd give it 4 stars for keeping a bottle of red at 55-65 degrees (since it doesn't do it for long), 2 stars if you're trying to keep a white wine cold, and 5 stars for looking good. Overall I'd still buy it again, but think 3 stars is an appropriate rating."
4,An Early Start For an Amazing Career,"If you can find this book (at an affordable price), it's well worth the read. This is not the polished storyteller Lloyd Alexander would later become. This is a young writer putting elements of his life with his young French bride to paper. As such, it has a few clumsy moments. I won't pretend this is one of his finer works.But it's honest and personal and inspired by Alexander's real wife, Janine. ""Janine is French"" is a comedy title (again, something not seen often in his later career) that follows the exploits of a soldier returning home from post World War II France with his young bride who, shortly after arriving, learns she desperately hates the States. The overall plot includes various attempts to build up money for this dream - all doomed by comedic happenstance. There's a lot of love in each chapter, though.Definitely give it a try."
2,Wrong Part,"I checked & double checked this item on the Amazon website BEFORE I placed the order. But this is the WRONG cabin filter for the 2007 Mazda Speed6. When I looked for the option to return it to Amazon, the cost of shipping it back was as much as the purchase price. So now, it is on a shelf in my garage.By the way, the correct cabin filter for the Mazda Speed6 can be purchased @ Genuine Auto Parts. I used a WIX filter # 24579."
4,"Good, but severely outdated","Excellent general guide. The information provided was accurate at time of publication, but the book has not been updated in almost twenty years. Many of the exhibits described have been updated, many zoos have added new exhibits, and a number of the exhibits described no longer exist."
3,Zoos As A Hobby,"Though some consider zoos outdated for the 21st Century, I along with other patrons, are very much aware of their necessity as breeding institutions, in the preservation of endangered animals of the world. Having owned this guide for many years now, I've used it as a reference point to other zoos, outside of my own Los Angeles Zoo. Other zoos I've had an enjoyable time visiting have been, of course, the San Diego Zoo. The San Diego Wild Animal Park. The Seattle Woodland Park Zoo. The San Francisco Zoo. And the Honolulu Zoo. Although I now feel it's well overdue for a revision, since many new exhibits have gone-up in the last few years. And since its publication, other institutions of note have opened, including Disney's Animal KIngdom in Orlando, which I had the pleasure of visiting in 2001. Take me to a major city, and one of my ""must see"" destinations is its zoo. But for what's out there, this guide would still be somewhat helpful."
1,Misguided information and ratings of Zoo exhibits.......,"It is unfortunate that Mr. Nyhuis has focused on some old fashioned ideas of what a good Zoo is. ie: He has rated Tropic World at the Brookfield Zoo in Chicago, as one of the top exhibits in the Zoo world. I have just visited the Zoo and was thoroughly disapointed and often horrified at the lack of realism and any real sense of theTropics. It is this complete difference of opinion that makes me question Mr. Nyhuis criteria of what a good exhibit is. He must base his opinion on size and grandeur. Tropic World is surely immense! However, it's size is it's biggest problem because of it's lack of quality on such a grand scale. Jungle World at NY's Bronx Zoo so far surpasses Tropic World in every way that it is an abomination to even compare the two. This is just one example of Mr. Nyhuis flawed reviews of Zoo's and thier exhibits."
2,Mindless watching,"Pretty much brainless and easy movie, no educational value whatsoever. Just for a kid crazy about beyblades, that's all. Gets boring after first 10 mins."
5,Very Informative,This book is chocked full of very helpful information and easy to read and understand. I recommend it to anyone interested in improving their health.
2,First Cleanse Sucks!,"Must use this product on an empty stomach!Not very effective, use other cleansers if you are serious regarding cleansing your body!"
4,Review of Delegation of Nursing Care,"Delegation of Nursing Care was a requirement for my Nursing Curriculum. It is precise and to the point, and easily explains what we think to be ""common sense"", but need to review before starting our career. I enjoyed the explanations given for each delegation discussed because they explained each process so thouroughly."
3,Good...could be much better.,"The gameplay is great, but the menus are extremely hard to manuever and the data of saved seasons and settings is hard to manage. It takes a long time to enter player names and the games doesn't save all of your settings. For example, I have to change the Camera view for every game. It has online play, but it is a joke. I have played 4 games with a cable modem. The game crashed 3 times and the fourth my competitor quit because we could not agree on a camera angle we both liked. Whe would you have to have the same camera angle even though you are playing on two different systems. They need to learn from EA Spots how to put a game online. If you like NBA2K3, you will like this, but it was an incomplete effort in all."
3,"Great Game, could be much better","Don't get me wrong, this is a wonderful game. However there are many errors that could make the game frustrating. 1. Passing is terrible. You have to use the analog for passing and it is confusing. 2. On offense you are always forced into long passes. The offense will just stand there after you pick up the dribble and the passes will always lead to turnovers. 3. There are fake teams on the game. Like Bridgeport Tech, and State University of Virginia. I dont know why they put those in the game. However, graphics are good and it's real college basketball. You are probably better off renting this one first."
3,Great looking but...,the game play is no good. No icon passing and horrible shooting players make this game one to pass on.
1,BOOK IS MORE THAN 10 YEARS OLD!,"OK, so it's my fault. I purchased this book to help my brother in his search for grad schools. He started to notice that the programs' websites didn't match up with what was written in the book. Finally, we saw that the book was published in 1998! In terms of graduate programs, that can be a lifetime. Many programs listed in this book no longer exist, whereas there are many newer programs that are not included. I believe there are now NINE editions of this book. Do not waste your time buying the fifth edition!"
4,"Man, that is so deep...","2000 o.d. is the only cd from Space Tribe that i listened to. I thought it was a risky buy at first (especially when i saw the cover which, in my opinion, is really ugly)but after 20 seconds my mind was blown away by the cool trance beats that this cd is filled with. The tracks are very fast-paced and energetic. There's always something interesting going on. The 3 last tracks are what keeps this cd from perfection but they still rock in their own way. I can't really compare this to other Space Tribe offerings that were made before so I can't say if it's better than any other of their cds ,but regardless of the past this is really a high quality title that fans of fast, trippy trance will really enjoy, period."
5,Top quality in a smaller screen,"Opting for a slightly smaller television with top notch quality was perfect for my small living space and desire to still have a ""home theater.""When compared picture for picture next to a Sony or a Mitsubishi of the same size, the Panasonic SuperFlat is very similar. It has bright, vivid color and crisp definition. The Panasonic has the edge in cost against a similar Sony Trinitron and Mitsubishi models of any stripe.The Panasonic CT27SF26 model is the smallest of the SuperFlat product line and lacks the DigitalReady features of the bigger models.The real beauty of this product shows when incorporated with a DVD player. With 700 lines of resolution, the picture is impeccable over just any other run of the mill 27""-36"" television including Panasonic's value conscious Panablack series."
2,Galco Speed Paddle Holster for Ruger SP101 2 1/4-Inch,"Galco does some of the best leather and stitching work that I've ever seen and I've purchased their products in the past with very few issues. However, the design on this item is very poor. The problem is the way that the paddle is attached to the holster. Since a revolver is a lot thicker in the front than in the rear, attaching the paddle to the holster with a flat piece of leather (rather that a wedge piece) causes the front of the revolver to point outward and the grip to jam into your side. The combination of this problem and an excessive forward cant (tilt) makes drawing the gun difficult at best."
4,Tough yet comfortable,"While this holster type and gun combo is too bulky (for me) to carry concealed, I like it when I'm working in the woods. It has held up well, keeps my revolver secure, and it comfortable all day."
4,For Michael Pare fans.,"I have been a fan of Michael Pare since Eddie and the Cruisers 1 and especially Eddie and the Cruisers 2. I liked the TV show Houston Knights 1987-88 because of him. This had a good story line and was well acted by Pare. I don't know why he hasn't had a TV series since his last one as his acting is as good as many on TV today and he is certainly as goodlooking today in middle age, as he was in his youth."
5,Excellent Resource,I found this to be an excellent resource on Mormonism. It is well structured and covers a lot of ground in an easy to carry format. Highly recommended.
4,It answered all of my questions! I'm now a Christian. Thanx,"I read this book with great interest after a friend encouraged me to get it. I was taking LDS missionary lessons, but after reading this book, I found that there was much more that the LDS did not tell me than what they had told me. This book told me the rest of the untold story. I am now a Christian and I am thankful that I did not get caught up in the tangled web of LDS theology that goes far beyond what God gave us in the Bible. Thanks, Zondervan, for this series. Bob D."
1,Bigotry is alive and well,"It is sad to see that religious bigotry is alive and well. Van Gorden claims to know Mormonism, and yet he gets so much basic information about it wrong. A serious waste of time and money."
5,True Freestyle,"This album is true freestyle at its best! It has latin house on it also. I was happy to see an album released after the single "" FEEL MY LOVE "" If you like dance music, this is one you will want to check out."
4,Projection Alarm Clock,"I really enjoy my projection alarm clock. Having the time and outside temperature projected onto my ceiling is very handy. It will also do well on walls, too. The forecast feature is not as useful as I thought it might be. I ran into one problem with the clock which I don't think was related to the manufacturer. The clock did not work on a.c. mode. Just battery. So, I sent it to the manufacturer who promtly fixed it and returned it. The clock I received from Amazon appeared at the time I opened the box to be a return. Probably because the a.c. wouldn't work. Would I buy a La Crosse Projection Clock again? Absolutely, and have recommended them to friends."
3,missing manual,"Overall the clock was good, the only drawback was the lack of manual in the box or on their website. I could tincker around to figure how to set it, but I'm not able to figure out all the features. I still don't know how to turn it off when the alarm goes off...."
1,Small Image & Hard to See,"The projected image is almost impossible to see even in total darkness. The time display on the unit is very small which makes it hard to see also. We thought we would like it, but sent it back the next day. We are very happy with Amazon's return process and policy."
3,Dissappointing,The clock shining on the ceiling is excellent.The outside temperature just doesn't work even though the sensor is 20' away with just a glass door between it and the unit. Bring the sensor inside and it works fine.We had a total of 68mm of rain and throughtout this the little man didn't have his umbrella out. We then had a week of real good weather hot sunny days and the little man had his umbrella out. He's unreliable to say the least.
2,Inaccurate outdoor temperature readout.,"Since I live in MN, I took the extra effort of obtaining the more expensive lithium batteries that work better at lower temperatures, as suggested in the product information. Outdoor temperature read consistently 6.5 degrees higher than actual temperature. I called La Crosse and they had changed their recommendation to standard alkaline AA batteries for the transmitter. Transmitted temperatures are now only 3 - 3.5 degrees higher than actual. Still not very accurate. On the positive side, the projected readout is sharp and entirely bright enough."
2,Looks cheesy,"Wasn't a big fan of this click. Its not really a good alarm click, the buttons are hard to use. The little guy getting dressed is cool for about a day, then you'll cease to ever pay attention or even notice that he's there. The only thing I enjoyed about this clock was its ability to display the time on the ceiling. Many projection clocks are available so that feature isn't quite uinque.The thermometer sensor for outside must have gotten wet or something as it no longer communicates with the main unit. It lasted about 8 months. I've tried new batteries, setup according to the instructions, etc.More importantly, this thing is ugly. My wife didn't appreciate it sitting in the bedroom as it looks chincy. Serves no purpose hidden in my office as I don't need the time projected on the ceiling."
4,Pretty Cool,"Neat clock, everything as described. Like the fact it doesn't glow in the dark unless you tap the snooze bar. Ceiling display could be brighter for dusk and dawn but it works otherwise. I like it!"
3,"Not bad, not great",After the first few songs the cd does lose spirit and like another review said toward the end you really feel the filler factor. Had a chance to see them with Film School at the Mercury in NY but after I got the CD I passed.
4,Interpol redux?,"This is great melodic music, jangling guitars, lots of space in the sound; however I am surprised no one has noticed the direct Interpol sound of these tracks: Interpol, another great-great NY band that paved the way for the rebirth of the ""Joy Division meets The Chameleons"" sound you will hear on this CD."
1,May not be such a good deal.,"The price ($4.99) was great. The service and shipping was great. I felt good about the purchase until I received the battery and discovered it was defective. It was completely dead and would not accept a charge. For what it cost, it wasn't worth paying the shipping to return."
5,Great item worth the price.,Like the item. The s\h fee is too high for this item. Postage shows under a dollar.Good value inspite of the s\h fee.
2,Motorola OEM v710 replacement upgrade battery,"This battery (Motorola SNN5760A) offers an excellent quality, durable, longer full-charge-service-life, battery upgrade. It is advertised as an 'extended-life,' improved performance battery that is compatible with existing standard covers. It does provide significantly longer, full-charge, standby and talk time than the original equipment (SNN5695A) battery. Unfortunately, the new battery does not properly fit in the original v710 case and cover. It nearly fits but the cover edges, left and right, do not completely seal leaving a one to two millimeter gap for dust to enter the compartment. The manufacturer should recommend the larger (deeper), extended-life battery cover to maintain sealing integrity. However, if one were to go to the larger cover then an even larger capacity (1600 + mah) extended battery is possible. An extended battery cover would also require a larger carrying case negating the objective of slim, compactness that some users desire ..."
2,MotOvation,"I received my battery about a month ago and it fit just fine in my E-815 phone but noticed that it couldn't hold a charge long enough compared to the original battery that came with my phone. At that point, I realized that the battery is probably old and found that it's manufacture date is""2005"" so I'm not sure whether the battery has a long shelf life or if they currently manufacture them. One other reviewer commented that they had the same problem regarding the charge. Either way, I'm still waiting to see whether the replacement will come any day now, so I can test it."
1,"old battery, poor capacity","I ordered 2 of these (they are cheap). Neither one will hold a charge more than about 16 hours, with less than 30 min of talk time. They were unopened, thus are sold as 'new' but probably have been on the shelf for too long."
5,Excellent book about educational technology,"This is a great book for anyone interested in educational technology. The author provides a historical look at how computers have been used in schools. Although, the book was written for administrators, it is a good read and valuable resource for researchers, teachers, parents and students. Unfortunately, the book is outdated as it was published in 1994. It is also out of print."
1,"NOT a 5-pack! Deceptive, well, actually a lie.","Like the title says. I purchased this ""5-pack"" and got one bulb. This is not cool, and is either deceptive advertising or, at best, negligence!"
1,False Advertising!,"I ordered this product because it was advertised as a 5-pack of light bulbs. When received, it was a single bulb. The company was not very helpful in resolving their mistake. After several phone calls, I finally got to talk to someone that was able to help me fix this problem. Don't order from this company, toolboxsupply.com"
2,phones,not very happy with the phone. its not very clear and picks up back round noise...however this phone was not new. the baby montitor works great alone with the paging system but thats about it.
5,THE solution for networking printing with Canon inkjets,"Most network print servers don't work well with Canon inkjet printers as they don't support the bi-directional status monitor. For something like my i9100, this is important. The Pricom does the job perfectly."
1,Requires a WIRED connection to router,"I bought this product thinking that, like most any wireless print server, I could use this print server to wirelessly connect my printer to a network. It turns out, this print server requires a wired connection to the LAN, so it was useless for me, because I wanted to use it to connect a downstairs printer to the network, but my router is upstairs. I only gave it 1 star because it was useless to me and now I have to deal with the hassle of mailing it back."
2,Problems,I paid $100 for this phone a year ago and it worked great until now. I'm surprised at Sony but the numbers 1 and 3 no longer work.
2,Barely a 2,Same problem with buttons after ~1yr. Has a great appetite for batteries. Radio Junk batteries seem the worst-approx. 30 da.
2,Worked well for about 2 years,"Bought this product 4 years ago and it worked fine for about two years. First problem: no longer could control the volume, second problem: a ""sticky"" talk button which slowly changed into the third problem: a ""stuck"" talk button. Couldn't use the phone after that."
5,Most awesome Barbie game ever,"ok... so I still play this game and I am 13. (I know that sounds wierd but.... yes, I do)It is the best Barbie game I have ever had and I have had them all. For an older kid like me I solved it quickly when I first got it (which was when I was 9) but kids younger will still have fun.The game changes so it will never be the same ""culprit"" or you will never have all the same clues.I would highly suggest this game because it is pure fun and I just play it because I can explore new areas every time that I do play this game."
3,Works in Vista,FYI: I was able to get this to work in windows vista. At first after installing it I got an error and the computer restarted. But then when I tried again in plays fine.
1,do not waste your money,"Grizzly makes some darn good woodworking machinery. Unfortunately, the bandsaw blades are horrible. They cut so badly that overheating is what they do best. They will burn your wood and go dull after just a couple of cuts.Buy a wood slicer. Much better blade for the money."
2,Already came knocking heads,- Slow- There are more noise that my old Hitachi.- From time to time I hear a Clink. It is the factory default.
5,Passage Through Time,"If you enjoy very smooth and relaxing hip-hop, pick this one up. It's a mix of beats like Prince Paul (DeLaSoul) & Hi-Tek (BlackStar). The flow is tight along with their rhymes. If you have a booming system in your ride and a girl you wanna impress, this album had such variety it can make the mood for both."
5,Great album,"If you are a beathead like me, then you will love this album. If you like Jay Dee or Pete Rock, then you will love this album. If you like underground hip hop, then you will love this album. Enough with the embellishments, this is a great album with beats that sound like a mixture of Pete Rock and Dilla. It's a shame these guys didn't get much play, but in any case this is a solid owner which you will never regret (especially since it's kinda rare)."
4,great,I bought theses sunglasses over a year ago and I wear them all the time. They are really scratch resistant and the lens are clear. These light weight sunglasses are perfect for everyday wear. I would recommend them to anyone.
5,Excellent reception,"This is the first cordless phone that has worked all over our house, including the basement. It has excellent range and reception."
4,pretty solid for softcore fans,"this is not rated X, dont be fooled, that ""X"" just means its not edited down R versions here....its pretty explicit stuff....and if you like Monique Alexander like I do, knowing its hard to find her in softcore, there are 3 scenes with her, the best being with the guy at the photoshoot."
1,Misleading,"**WARNING**This movie is not the 1971 version starring Rene Bond and Sandi Carey. This is a softcore movie made in the 2000's shown on the Playboy Channel. If you are looking for Rene Bond, you will be very disappointed. IMBD also shows this same cover for the 1971 version - there is an error in both listings."
5,"It's rated ""X"" WOW WEE!!!","This follows the very erotic tale of three sexual private investigators--men and women whose job is to surreptitiously follow objects of desire, find out their secrets, and relay them to those who covet their affection. Armed with the knowledge of their crush's job, interest, and life, these clients now possess powerful tools of seduction."
4,More fun than you would expect!,"Groove-it is a hand held game that plays music and calls out hand movements, that become, in turn more complex. My 9 year old and 5/12 year old boys love to play, and ""groove"" along to the music as they do. It is a great toy for long drives, and has lead to lots of laughter and fun interaction for our family. They howled when my husband showed them his cool moves! I would so much rather my boys take turns with Groove-it, root each other on to reach their individual best, than stare blankly at a gameboy."
1,rotten toy,I bought this for my eight year old girl's birthday. It was a complete waste of money. The product is very hard to understand. When you try to do the right moves; it still counts you out. The on/off switch is just a button amoung buttons that are not labeled. It just lays in the toy box; waiting to be taken to Goodwill.
3,Revised,"I'm glad that they are finally reproducing the fabulous books of James Flora. I knew this was an updated edition, but be warned...both the text and the artwork have been completely redone from the 1955 version, with portions snipped out. It will not be the book you remember, but it's a nice book."
4,A real workhorse,"I have been using the 6-Disc DX-C540 for about ten years. Once a CD got stuck inside. My brother and I took the unit apart, extracted the stuck CD, and put it back together. Other than that, no problems. This CD changer has a somewhat warm, almost analog-like sound, in a good way. I have used it with various amps receivers, and speakers, and only now with my NAD C372 int. amp does the Onkyo sound not quite as great as I thought it used to. Still, the NAD brings out the best in it. I have just bought a Sony CDP-CA70ES 5-Disc changer on Ebay. When I get it, I'll pull the Onkyo to compare the two units. Should be interesting. I believe the DX-C540 has been superseded by the Onkyo DX-C380. The 540 has more front-panel versatility and most likely, the 380 is more current internally...DAC, MP3, and such. Anyway, the 540 has served me well for quite a few years and reliably so."
4,Onkyo DX-C540 6-CD Changer,No problems with this item. The big plus is the ability to add up to 5 CDs while it is playing.
2,pretty lame,"Sound is ok, but it has absolutely no ability to absorb even tiny bumps, depsite giving it a lot of extra cushioning, so it skips way too much. It can even make itself skip when the music volume is turned up. Also has a hard time with moderately damaged CDs."
4,The best critical book in English on Cassavetes,"The shocking intolerance and hysteria of ""idiephile""'s review demands a response. Comparing the writing of Ray Carney to ice cream and the writing of Kouvaros to ground glass is cheap-shot sloganeering and advertising, not criticism of any kind. In fact, the prose of Kouvaros is lucid and pleasurable, and what he has to say about Cassavetes is thoughtful and unpredictable. What a strident anti-intellectual like Cassavetes might have thought about any book written about him, especially an academic one, is irrelevant."
1,Spanish in the kitchen,It dosnt give you enough words from things in the kitchen. It has activities fro you to do with your child and it skips to each activity. It dosnt cover enough vocabulary in my opinion. I found in order to learn enough vocabulary i had to go through about 5 lessons and them i felt bad for not doing all the acitvites.
5,"Got the pair, Jo and Meg together!","I was original interested in purchasing the 6"" figures, but then found out Jo version which is standing next to my computer... Nice details, so I decided to purchase the pair, Meg this figure is the pair of Jo the 1/8 version, which make a GREAT and AWESOME artistic couple... I will say this only once, if you intend to purchase this figures, both at the same time, rather do it! Cause you wont regret it, never they are top class art on this models. Believe me!"
2,Razorback crewneck,"I returned this sweatshirt because of the color. It was so bright red that my son would not wear it. I'm not sure anyone would. We love Razorback red, but to us, this was not it."
5,It is very good,"It is fantastic. As we know it almost impossible to translate a classical Chinese novel into English without a 100% understanding of the Chinese culture and history. I have read the Chinese edition of this novel twice and I have been looking for an English translation of the novel, this one satisfies me quite well."
2,A Limp Noodle of a Sequel,"I love AZUMI 1 and was looking forward to this, but during and after the viewing I was left underwhelmed and disappointed. It lacked the charm and draw that the first film had. The lead actress seemed to lack the charisma that she had in the first Azumi and it just seemed every character was just doing their part and phoning in their performances rather then drawing your attention to the screen. If you are a fan of the first, I recommend you check it out, but lower expectations and don't expect to find it as enjoyable as the first Azumi."
3,it is ok....,"I do think they cut off the budget and used a lot of computer generated images. The gang's plot was just stupid. They could not even fight. Everyone got killed so easily. The spy girl's plot was good. The movie is very short. When the main story(not sidetrack) started, it already passed 3/5 of the movie. The spider fighting was great, but it was too much computer generated imaged. How can that guy push his face back up after getting sliced by fiber???!"
3,The fighting scenes and the plot are not interesting as part 1 but it's still worth watching.,The fighting scenes and the plot are not interesting as part 1 but it's still worth watching. I like it because it brings closure to this series.
3,"This was good, The FIRST was BETTER","Let's put it this way, when I watched the first AZUMI, I fell in love with it and watched it again a few days later. Then watched it a 3rd time in another few days.I love Aya Ueto, the lead actress playing Azumi. I love all the other actors/actresses as well. (Even my home girl, veteran actress Reiko Takashima) but AZUMI 2 was a little bit of a let down. Don't get me wrong, it is in fact an entertaining movie. But it lost the ""spark"" of the first film. I recommend AZUMI 2 to fans of Asian cinema, Action films and Movie Buffs.Can you live with out seeing Azumi 2? Yes, you can. But if you like the actors and actresses, and these types of films then it is at least worth checking out."
5,The Best Candy In The World,"Bring it back, please!! This candy is delicious. It's tart, bracing and completely mouthwatering. I've loved it since I was in 4th grade (this was several decades ago)."
5,"Great sound, I'm very satisfied","I decided to retire my DJ needle for a hi-fi, as I listen to record more than beat-match these days. My budget was $100, and with Grado's reputation for great sounding headphones (I love my SR-80i) I decided to go for a Green1. I'm very satisfied! My old cartridge was an Ortofon Nightclub MK2 (these also cost about $80), known to be the best sounding DJ needle. The Grado isn't a massive improvement, but the differences are noticeable and worth the upgrade.Just like how the SR-80i is an excellent budget audiophile headphone, I believe the Green1 to be an excellent choice for a budget audiophile cartridge."
2,Very overstated in reviews,"I was very disappointed with this cartridge after reading the reviews.I found the cartridge flat and not musical at all, there were no dynamics in the music. I thought I had setup the cartridge wrong so I double checked the alignment and the tracking force, no improvement. I then thought it needed sometime to break in, so I let it play over about 20 records in two days, still with no improvement.Maybe my hopes were too high for a sub $100 cartridge, but I would say avoid this cartridge and save up for a Grado Gold or a Statement, I am going back to a Dynavector 10x5."
2,Precocious,"This album does have three remarkable songs, the elegiacally wrenching ""Where You'll Land"" with an effective horns-meet-Texas-blues build-up at the end, the annoying-redundant-musically but lyrically solid ""Everything We Used To Be,"" and ""Hoshi No Oto""... a 37-second piece of electronic drone! (""A Bigger City"" is a nice song... if you're a self-deluded-in-love lonely indie twenty-something.) And that's it! The rest is trite, self-important twee. Sorry. Not the ""indie rock"" masterpiece others have decreed."
3,Three and a half stars on a generous day . . .,"Once there was a tremendously naive American schoolteacher who spent time in Russia and fell for a tall, dark, handsome, arrogant KGB agent. Then she wound up back in the US, a single mother to the precocious daughter who was born as a result.Except now, years later, Mr. Tall-Dark-Et Cetera has reappeared, and wants to be part of the family. But trust comes hard for the woman who's been betrayed, and this is the point where the reader may get a little impatient with both hero and heroine: Meg has a nasty habit of jumping to conclusions and freaking out, and Kon has a nasty habit of being unbelievably obtuse about her fears.On the plus side, though, there are some incredibly tender moments when the two are not losing it or glaring at each other. I like the book better now than the first few times I read it . . ."
2,ITS NOT WHAT SOME PEOPLE EXPECT,MOST OF U MIGHT THINK THAT THIS BOOK IS ABOUT THE TRADITIONAL FAIRLY TAIL THAT U RECOGNIZE. WRONGGGGGG! IT IS COMPLETELY 100 PERCENT D.I.F.F.E.R.E.N.T.!.!.!........ THERE IS A NUTCRACKER BUT DOESN'T COME TO LIFE A NORMAL TOY. IT IS REALLY ABOUT A GIRL WANTING TO KNOW WHERES HER DAD.
1,WHEN YOU GOT N-O-T-H-I-N-G ELSE 2 DO!,during the book i was bored 2 death! its the most NOT interesting romance i have ever read/ the end is so predictable... i read it as an assigment 2 my class... do not waist your time on it!
1,DO NOT READ! UNLESS U LIKE A STORY ABOUT FAMILY PROBLEMS.,DO NOT READ. IF U LIKE A BOOK THAT DEALS WITH FAMILY PROBLEMS ON CHRISTMAS GO AHEAD AND READ IT .I HAVEN'T READ THE BOOK YET BUT I THOUGHT IT WAS THE TRADITIONAL STORY U KNOW SUGARPLUM FAIRIES< TOYS COME ALIVE ETECC>>>>>>>>
3,Basic documentary,"A fairly basic documentary, For someone new to military jets this is a good video for them, but tothose jet enthusiasts looking for more than the basics,forget it. The footage is somewhat grainy and dated therefore it gets a 3 star rating."
3,"Good episodes, poor DVD transfer","I bought this (and volume 1) mostly for nostalgic purposes, although the shows are still quite enjoyable. As others have commented, the quality of the DVD (both volumes) is poor."
2,"Decent strings, but not worth the hefty price tag.","These were very temperamental strings.Obligato strings are known to have a warm and soft sound to them. These strings, however, were extremely loud, scratchy and could not handle even the slightest amount of bow pressure.To their credit, however, the Obligatos sounded fairly decent when playing pianissimo, piano and mezzo forte passages. These strings simply could not handle anything at or above a forte dynamic."
5,Brendan Mulvihill disagrees,"Brendan Mulvihill who was all-Ireland champion several times advised me to try the Obligatos. They are expensive but so rich and responsive. And yes, they can give a little subtlety to a violin that tends to have a brighter sound if you prefer dark. But we put a set of used ones on an old violin someone dragged out of the closet and played a gypsy duet, and wow! Just the ticket."
4,much much better,"I'm the one who wrote an unfavorable review for the first I Love Toy Train video. I have to say that these are SO much better -- VERY good. THESE I would recommend freely to anyone. They look a lot better and the content is great. One of the videos shows a steam engine festival that's very interesting; and the information given about the trains in general is also very interesting. And Jeff, you do a great job!"
1,Awful,"I had high hopes for this author, but I could barely get through this book. Ms. Edwards needs to be instructed on the difference between a period and an exclamation point. (FYI, Ms. Edwards, they ARE NOT interchangeable.) It seemed nearly every sentence ended with an exclamation point. It was exhausting to read. Where the heck was her editor?"
2,Usual Edwards,"One would think that with the sheer volume of books that Cassie Edwards published, she would learn a thing or two along the way. In this story, yet another beautiful white woman is kidnapped by yet another chief. The dialogue is again stilted and awkward in some parts, and ellipses are abused. There are also a few awkward descriptions in the sex scenes, and since there's so many of them across the Savage books, they get so repetitive that I actually find myself skimming across them because the same thing always happens, they experience great passion, etc etc.The ending was rather unrealistic with Rebecca Veach's mother. It was just basically a deux es machina to wrap up the story. At the back of the book is a picture of Snow Deer, Ms. Edwards' great-grandmother. In the picture, Snow Deer is fat and rather unhappy-looking. This book is a prequel to Savage Longings which features Snow Deer as the main character. Overall I can;t really recommend this book or its sequel."
1,What The Thumb?!,"For some reason my old boss thought THIS would be an appropriate Secret Santa gift for me a few years ago... (keep in mind I'm a 28 year old man and she was a fifty-something y/o woman and we worked at a bank....) Not only is it the dumbest toy on earth it also resembles something you'd find in an ADULT toy store and not the local K B Toys which happened to be going out of business (with inventory like this, no wonder). On a side note, Thumb Thing made me realize that I seem to have the stubbiest thumbs ever which gave me a complex. Thumb Thing is no match for small kids with under-developed thumbs. Stop the madness Mattel, and get a grip."
1,this is last year's model. buy this years model from elsew..,buy this year's model the 36FS12 from anywhere else like 800.com or bestbuy.com for the same freaking price. it has more features and fixes some problems with this model.
2,deteriorated after 4 years,got it repaired 6 months before end of 5 year extended warranty. luckily before good guys went out of business! even with that repair we notice green flare at corners and the black at top and bottom of borders are approaching paralellogram territory. in summary this thing just managed to reach warranty lifetime. makes me think twice about buying more expensive sxrd fearing it will also conk out.
3,More Waves Than the Ocean,"When my new Sony WEGA XBR arrived and I turned it on I was speechless. At first glance, you will be generally impressed by the video and audio. However, give it some time. Sooner or later you will begin seeing what seems to be digital (pixilation) artifacts on screen and in certain scenes, you will see distortion in both the vertical and horizontal axis. This is typically evidenced in closeup scenes that pan from left to right (wonderful ripples) and is especially annoying while watching a stock ticker crawl across the screen. And don't bother trying to watch a ""Jeopardy"" question. It will jump around the screen. This is NOT a $2,000 television. As a die-hard Sony fan, it came as a real shock to find that they are pushing this product out the factory door. Save your money and look elsewhere! So why am I so kind with three stars? I'm hoping a Sony rep will see this review and offer me my money back or at the very least give me a trade with a fully working model!"
2,Too noisy for frequent use,"This is a nice little lamp. I like the design and that it folds away to such a small size. The light is decent, though not extremely bright. It is a nice clear colourless light though. However, for such a small light, I'm amazed at what a loud hum it puts out. Often it's too distracting to read by. I've never heard a lamp buzz like this -- only lights that have dimmers. I'd avoid this one until they can work out how to make it quieter."
5,The best diabetic cookbook ever,"This is the most comprehensive cookbook for diabetics I've ever seen. Once you start using it, you won't be thinking of what you think you shouldn't eat, but will concentrate instead on all the wonderful and delicious recipes that will enable you to stay in control. The ones I made were really delicious, and very easy and to make, and since all the recipes have exchanges and nutritionals, including carbos, cooking diabetic meals is a no-brainer. With over a thousand recipes, you'll find hundreds you'll like; a fine addition to your kitchen bookshelf."
2,Proceed with caution,Many of the recipes in this cookbook have in excess of 50-60 carbs per serving. Many times a serving is way less then what actually we put on our plates. As a diabetic I could not recommend this book to someone new to diabetes control. A+ for the quanity and quality of the recipes but NOT for a diabetic.
3,ok cookbook!,This cookbook was a bit of a dissapointment to me. I like plain and simple cooking!I found only a few recipes that I will use!
4,"First album, and a good one!","This is Vitas' first album, and it was released in 2001. The title will sound as ""Philosophy of a Miracle"" when translated from the Russian language to English. Listen to it, and you may soon become Vitas's fan, just like many others did..."
5,Every child should see THIS version!!!,"Robinson Crusoe is a timeless classic. I find this version to be among the best because of the underlying message that it conveys, ""shed the restraints of civilization and return to your roots."" It seems a great message for today's youth as our economy crumbles under the weight of commercialism and over indulgence. Steve Drexel (Douglas Fairbanks) sets off to recreate HIS civilization on a deserted island in the image of New York City. He faces several challenges, including an attack by natives from a neighboring island who are acting at the bequest of the rivals of Drexel. The lesson for the children takes a bit of a turn when Drexel escapes the island with a native women (Saturday played by Maria Alba) and returns to NYC with her on his yacht where she performs in the Ziegfeld Follies. An almost complete reversal from the original intention to escape the modern world, Mr. Robinson Crusoe brings the uncivilized back...Ironic..."
1,This CD is Defective,It is impossible for me to gauge the quality of the performance on this CD because the disk itself is defective. It is unplayable. It skips everywhere on the disk. So disappointing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
4,"Rape, rape, rape, and more rape","The ""plot"" of this manga revolves almost exclusively around the repeated kidnapping, rape, and sexual torture of the main character. The characterizations are bland (how many incarnations of the stoic seme do we need to see in one story?), the plot is paper-thin and predictable, and the sex scenes just aren't sexy unless you're really into bondage. So why am I giving this book 4 stars?Two reasons: first, the artwork. Ayano Yamane's artwork is absolutely gorgeous, her tones are beautiful, and her paneling is dynamic and attractive. If it's eye candy you want, you'll get it here.Second, the side stories. About a third of this book is taken up by unrelated side stories, two of which have stronger plots and character development than the main story, and all of which can be enjoyed by a reader who isn't heavily into kink. The side stories bump this book up from a shaky 3 to a solid 4--worth reading, even with the ridiculously high cover price."
2,Too biased; not credible,"Although I'm sure Mr. Aldrich wrote about the lack of security as he saw it, it appeared too biased to be believable. I felt some of the cicumstances were a bit exaggerated, as well as overstated. While I don't have a problem with the conflicts of the book, it is easy to see that Mr. Aldrich had no good things to say about the Clinton Administration"
5,"Thank You, Thank You, Thank You",This book reveals some of the crimes and destruction that the Clinton Administration has done to our federal government. No President in the American history has committed more crimes against humanity than the Clinton Administration.
1,Biased,"This is the first book review I have ever written. This was the most biased book I have ever read. Surely there must have been at least one person with some good qualities in the Clinton White House. The author says horrible things and then says ""this was verified by some nobody"". I have only read 87 pages but I can't take any more. I want my money back and the two hours it took me to read to page 87."
5,an honest and very scary story about bill clinton,my uncle has served for thr fbi for 30 years and most of those years were spent inside the white house. he is considered one of the most intelligent and noteworthy men in his class. he is respected and admired in his field as well as in his family. his contributions to this book are correct and very true. bill clinton should be impeached....those of you who deny these allegations against him only identify with the problems and disgusting values in which bill clinton holds.
5,Don't Vote for Hillary 'Till You Read This,"I read this book years ago, but I recommended it again just today. If even a fraction of it is true (and I suspect it is a whole lot more than a fraction), it is REALLY scary."
4,This book is not for the timid.,"This is not a literary masterpiece, however this is a must read. I was simply amazed by the content of this book. Aldrich has done this country a fine service by chronicling the shenanigans at the Clinton White House.I too recognize the singular incident which critics have taken Aldrich to task on, but clearly this book is a first hand account of the Clinton disorganization. Throughout my reading of this book I kept asking myself ""where is/was the media?"" For instance, Aldrich details the sex and drug activitiesin the White House (a charge made by the Speaker) and the media turns a blind eye. After reading this book you will understand the courage it took to write this account."
5,"I don't like to read, but I could not put this book down!","There are not many books that keep my attention, but I couldn't put this one down. It usually will take me a month to read a book this size, but I read Unlimited Access in two days. Mr. Aldrich contrasts the Clinton Administration with the Reagan/Bush Administrations. He takes a neutral position and tells the story in such a way that you know he is telling the truth"
1,Bad writing galore,"This is one of the worst books in recent memory. I was only able to read a couple of pages at a time. The reconstructed ""dialogue"" rings false--people simply don't speak the way Mr. Aldrich writes, which left me wondering how much was invented. The most objectionable, however, was the ego-driven nature of this biased report of the White House. Rarely have I read such self-important drivel. This book is amusing at times (all unintended by the author), but the rare chuckles are not worth the price of this book. Save your money."
1,"Waste of money, time and paper","First of all im not pro or against Clinton. I just wanted to read an insider book about The White House. This book however is just a waste of money, time and paper.. All you get is a lot of gossip.....aka "" a man came into my office and told this story "" the person cannot be named...of course ? This is just a sad book from a sad and bitter and burned out man."
3,"An Interesting Book, But No Sources!","I read this book solely based on the positive reviews it had received. While Unlimited Access is very informative, Aldrich does not give his sources, so the validity of the stuff he writes about is somewhat suspect. While I do believe that a lot of the negative things about Clinton are true, and Aldrich's writing is good and entertaining, this book should not be condidered 100% fact. Until Aldrich reveals his sources, Unlimited Access will not be taken seriously by most people."
1,This publication is Republican drivel at it's worst.,"After having read this book, I am amazed that anyone wouldseriously believe much of any thing in it. Mr Aldrichshould be ashamed of himself and if the truth were known, heprobably is. When and where were any of these facts eversubstantiated? This whole book was filled with such silliness,that I am amazed he was able to find a publisher for thewhole mess. Obviously the publishers must be Republicantoo. What a coincidence!"
4,HARD READING IF YOU,"This book is a very difficult read. It is not pleasant to bereminded of the garbage that the Clintons brought to Washington. Ihave three points to make. (1)I wish Mr Aldrich had less to say about cultural differences between administrations. The differences can be argued subjectively and detract from other, more substantive and factual issues. (2) The campaign funding scandals and the use of the White House as a Holiday Inn, both go a long way toward verifying the substance of Mr Aldrich's allegations. (3)Where is the press? Certainly they were aware that many administration people did not have security clearances yet were privy to highly confidential documents.The book is a must read."
4,CLINTON IS A TRAITOR,"I give it an 8 only for stylistic reasons, not substantive reasons. Among many other things, Aldrich documents the Clinton's utter lack of regard for security in the White House. This atmosphere made possible the espionage by agents of the People's Republic of China, as documented by the Thompson hearings, and recently reported by Bob Woodward in the Washington Post and William Safire in the New York Times (see especially Safire's op-ed piece of Feb. 16). Gary Aldrich is an American Hero. Bill Clinton is an American TRAITOR. He should be impeached IMMEDIATELY. And if there was any justice in this world, his punishment would not be restricted to ""removal from office."" It is simply beyond me how Americans could have elected this piece of human garbage twice. But, then again, by definition, fully one-half of the entire population is of below average intelligence!"
1,It is a shame an FBI Agent has become an tabloid reporter.,If this agent had such a problem with what he saw he would have left. Is this book credible? If these things are true how come we have not heard these things from closer Whitehouse sources. I think the Clintons have their problems. But this guy has more problems. It is a shame that this person ever became an FBI Agent. He is as bad as the current director. He is using his position for political reasons. He offers no proof but his word. He should have wrote this book like he was preparing a case. Produce hard facts. Why is Clinton in the Whitehouse today. Nobody has been able to prove he did anything worth convicting him in the Senate. This author only serves to make himself look petty and vengeful.
1,Book in need of an editor,"This was a book with much potential that missed the mark. What could have been an intelligent look behind the scenes came off as a prissy, uptight, whine-fest. Alldrich sites somelaughable petty greivances among the real ones.Going in, I knew it was a book with a slant and accepted that with an open mind. Upon reading, I felt it needed a better editor to tighten up the truth from editorial griping.He repeatedly states that his job was to issue a background check/report, without conclusions or judgement, for others to evaluate. Then he gives sample reports at the end on the Clintons; full of petty commentary. A good editor should have had him doing some rewrites."
1,a collapse of maturity,"about as helpful, intelligent and/or reliable as a ham sandwich, this book is one man's bitter tirade against an administration who decided he needn't work for them. the ambition and reasoning for writing the book is solely for the money coming in for book sales - do not believe it was any sort of civic duty.the book grounded up Aldrich's reliability and outright respectability. he is no more than a whiner and opportunist with this book."
1,so what!,"Yeh, Clinton is a lousy man with a witch for a wife...and maybe they've disgraced the White House and the office of the Presidency...Maybe everything in Gary Aldrich's book is accurate...it probably is...but WHO CARES! The economy is rolling along, we're gonna have nationalized health care, and the Democrats are gonna be back in power again! I don't even care about the rather serious security breaches at the White House...we NEED Bill and Hillary...they're gonna save us all from capitalism...if they trash the White House along the way to our socialist dream state, SO WHAT!"
4,None of this has ever been refuted -- none of it!,"Bottom line: if you are a Clinton apologist, you won't have much use for this book. Read Gene Lyons and Joe Conason fairy tales instead. If you don't worship Bill Clinton as your lord and personal saviour, I recommend the book for its chilling portrayals of life inside the White House in the early Clinton years. This book is well ahead of its time -- yes, others inside the White House during that time will also write books verifying the information in here soon after Clinton leaves, but those people won't be treated like Aldrich, since they worship Clinton as well. The book isn't written terribly well, as it reads like an FBI report. But if you are intellectually honest and open minded, the book will make your skin crawl."
5,"Excellent book about the ""nuts & bolts"" of the White House","This book presented the real-life issues about the ""nuts &bolts"" workings of the comings and goings in the White House. The current residence of the White House are very intelligent and therefore I could not understand why some the various White House appointments seemed so sloppy. From this book I could understand how these current White Houseresidents ""misfired"" with appointments. There were tried and true practices used by both political parties. These practicies kept the White House from selecting personnel with inappropriate backgrounds from doing the ""people's"" business. Ethics and character are important, and this book displays how those were violated within this White House. Excellent and fast reading."
5,Where's the outrage?,"Mr. Aldrich should be complimented for his courage in writing such a well detailed review of the highest office in the land. This is a must read for any American concerned with the current direction of the country and the lack of character shown by the First Family. If the evidence were not true Mr. Aldrich would have had his ""socks sued off by now.&quot"
4,A Colorful Czechoslovakian Folktale,"Many people have told and retold the folktale about Marushka and the cruel way her stepmother and lazy stepsister treat her. This retelling is much the same as the others so I withheld one star. However, Marushka's story is a classic one of good-hearted innocence triumphing over selfishness and this version includes the marvelous characters, the Month Brothers who are instrumental in helping poor Marushka to accomplish the impossible tasks she is ordered to do. The illustrations are folksy and simple but just filled with atmosphere and are the best part of the book. It is an overall pleasurable read with the repetitive sort of storyline that helps little ones learn to follow a plot."
4,My dad's favorite story to read to me as a kid...,I've been looking for this story for my dad for a while... We had a collection of books that had (a slightly different version of) this story & I was excited to find this. It has gorgeous pictures & is told very well. 4stars just because it's not the exact version I was looking for.Hardcover.
5,Excellent,"Very Good book! It makes you feel like you are living in the late 1890's in a small town in Ohio. It is the story of a young woman, Mary, trying to make her way in the world. Behind the story you see her struggles and challenges in every day life. It shows the hard choices she has to make and their consequences. It was a nice change from other romance novels that Mary discovers she could make a life for herself without a husband.Highly Recomended!"
2,Decent unit for the first year,This unit is nothing fancy but worked fine for the first year. The caller ID screen is small and difficult to read without proper lighting. After a year the recorded messages were choppy and difficult to understand. Repair from Panasonic would cost more than the unit itself.
2,no directions and very little taping space,"Chose it because Panasonic is my favorite and my old one of 25 years died. thought this was a replacement. It was awful. No directions, short amount of time for messages, very poor and the toll saver doesn't seem to work although it may be because there were no directions I don't know how to do it. I am sorry I bought it. Didn't realize it was ""used"" and it really was!!"
2,Nothing Special,"it's just your basic answering maching.i didn't like the fact that it doesn't startscreening until someone leaves a message.no outgoing message screening.the little viewing screen is very hard to read.i bought it used, and it sounded like the little speaker had been blown out.terrible sound.i don't know if we're allowed to call products junk, or not.but if i knew i could, on this one i would."
1,A lifeless read...,"Trudging through this book was a task, and not something I rather enjoyed. I believe if you are going to read something, you should enjoy it. And this... did nothing for me. If you want to know about Canada, or better yet, the Hudson Bay Company; the Canadian Government offers great links and information that was far more enticing then this novel."
5,wonderfully recounted history of Western Canada and its explorers,I purchased and read both volumes of this series when they were originally issued. They were both memorable and lively accounts of the economic motivation to explore and develop Canada. The personalities come alive and the stories flow beautifully through the author's well researched and brilliantly written narrative.
1,This product killed my fish,Don't risk it! Pro Balance 7 Day Betta Blocks made by Penn-Plax no doubt killed my fish. I put a block in his bowl to test it before leaving on vacation. It killed an otherwise healthy betta within just a couple of hours. The tablet started dissolving quickly and putting off stuff in the water. It looked like my fish had been poisoned. He was in distress and could not swim or breathe and died right away.
2,Unless I got a defective package...,"I bought based on the 2 good reviews. but mine always made the water very dirty within a day.We went for 7 day vacation, we had two very healthy bettas - one of them died by the time we came back...I am going to try something else next time."
3,"bought it, tried it, still unsure","i bought the betta blocks after looking at a mechanicle feeder (expensive) and resurching and reading different reviews for the blocks. i feel i have to ride the fence and say they did give me peace of mind that my fish would not starve. but i truly wonder how effective they are. one block lasted about 3 days. since i was not home to abserve my fish eat i am not sure how exactly the blocks worked. the only difference i see in pearly now is that his eating habits with his regular food change for a couple feedings after using the blocks.i will be using them agian and would recomend them as a peace of mind.i would not recomend them as a main food source, only for periodic use."
1,Have no idea how it works,"I've bought this feeder before one of my long weekends so I wouldn't have to worry about feeding my Betta. In a middle of the week I decided to make sure it works while I'm still home. I dropped it in aquarium. My first reaction was: ""Why did it drown?""; Bettas are surface feeders. So, I thought, maybe the released food will float up? It didn't.Totally useless product."
1,dont use,Came home from vacation and our Betta was dead...and had been for awhile...Horrible thing to come home to..Would never use again...EVER
1,Health hazard to your fish,"I normally don't leave reviews but I feel so strongly about this product that I felt the need to contribute my warnings to the already numerous warnings on here: Do Not Use This!I left a block with my betta over Spring break (only 7 days). When I came back, there was green, powdery gunk all around the remnants of the block. Luckily, my betta looked okay and the ammonia levels weren't that bad - which I attribute to all the aquatic plants I have in the tank. I feel like if I didn't have the plants to reduce the ammonia, I would have come back to a dead betta."
3,Good replacement shield,"I'm actually quite happy with this replacement shield. So why just 3 stars? Two reasons: I think all of these replacement shields are over-priced for what you're really getting. Second, they ALL break too easy as well. If you drop your helmet just once, there's a good chance the spot where the shield connects to your helmet will break.That said, this has been a good buy for me."
2,Blue Monday: Fats Domino and the Lost dawn of Rock'n Roll,"Blue Monday is an interesting but not a compelling read. We never get inside Fat's head to understand the man, so we get an expanded discography. The dates, times and places seem to be well researched which begins to wear after a while. The matter of fact style just does not bring Fat's personal life into focus, although there are many descriptions of incedents about him. He remains a mystery in reference to his personal motivation, dual life style, and reclusive habits.Russ H."
5,Walking to New Orleans,"Thanks to Rick Coleman for writing this entertaining and educational book about Fats Domino and the blues scene in New Orleans. I am a huge fan of music of all types so I picked up this book, not as an avid fan of Fats Domino, but because it sounded interesting. Once I started reading this book I could not put it down and could not get past this feeling that I had no idea of the importance of New Orleans to blues and rock n roll and had no idea how important Fats Domino was to music in general. I must admit that I really only knew about two songs of Fats (Ain't That a Shame and Blueberry Hill) but this man was a hit making machine and influenced many more musicians and sounds that are still relevant today. I ended up reading the book twice in a row and have now purchased some Fats Domino CD's as well as other great NOLA blues artists such as Dave Bartholomew and Roy Brown. If you love music and, especially the history of music, I highly highly recommend this book."
5,My Blue Heaven,"Rick Coleman has given stellar treatment to the life and times of an R&B icon who exploded into deserved pop stardom as well. The New Orleans Fat Man shimmers, rocks and rolls in this lovingly crafted portrait, backed up by front row views of his equally vital, rhythmic and multi-faced band. I played Fats' records as a 50s/60s radio DJ so going back in these pages to the first time around was a rare and bountiful second chance for me. No empty kiss and tell treatment here. This is core stuff. Beyond Fats, the author serves up unforgetable snapshots of contemporary teen idols on tour. Move over Peter Guralnick. Rick Coleman's gaining on you."
1,Missing pages...,"I like this book - in fact a complete copy might get a four star review from me. It's well written and provides fascinating insight into the people and places that defined a burgeoning art form at a critical time in U.S. history. HOWEVER, my read was brought to a screaming halt by a De Capo Press manufacturing defect: 25 MISSING PAGES (jumps from 180 to 205). Unacceptable, and completely undetectable until rudely encountered while reading.Anyway, my advice is look immediately for missing pages in this paperback edition - if you are like me and buy ahead in your reading materials, you might just find yourself past the Amazon ""return window"" with no recourse. Perhaps this is a book best purchased at a brick-and-mortar store where you can look for this particular defect before you spend your money.Disappointing interruption of a fairly good read."
4,The History of a river.,"These are the reflections of a man who had studied this powerful river for the last 40 years.The river ran through six countries and had seen civilizations emerge and disappear. It had also seen revolution, war, pollution, and destruction. Countries in the upper Mekong liked to dam the river to harness electricity while people in the lower part of the river need its water for agriculture and for its fish. Building dams in the upper Mekong could affect the ecology in the lower Mekong delta. The balance of these antagonistic goals could only be solved if the governments involved were more considerate to each other.No one could tell the history of the Mekong better than the author."
2,Focuses on the arrival of Europeans and after,"The jacket copy on this book claims that it covers events ""spanning two thousand years... beginning with the rise of... Oc Eo, to the glory of the Cambodian Empire in the first millennium..."" This is true to the extent that all years up to 1511 are covered in the first 30 pages, and the next twenty pages take us up to 1860. For coverage of early Southeast Asian history, I recommend the Lonely Planet guides as much more detailed, and more useful once you're there. (On the causes of the fall of the empire at Angkor, Osborne says ""No single, overriding cause for this event can be identified, nor would it be sensible to try and find one."" My Lonely Planet guide discussed the patterns of overbuilding, mentioned the deliterious effect of the corveé, and talked about issues with water supply, at least.) If your interest is in Southeast Asia since the French came, then this is a fairly absorbing and well-written book."
1,Views of the Mekong from Europe,"I read this book out of interest in South-East Asian culture which from the back sounds like what it addresses. However I have read few books that were more Euro-centric then this one. Very little of this book goes into information about the river or the people predating the French. I was also disappointed that almost every source that the author quotes is a minority, catholic, exile, political elite, European or mixed Chinese. The book is rather slow and the author seems to wish the return of the French and their ""Charm"". I wouldn't recommend this reading this book unless you're studying French colonialism."
3,Very small but adorable,I agree that this is a very small bassinet. It would not be suitable for a child past six to eight months old. I am debating on exchanging it for the bigger one. It does seem very comfy though and just as adorable as in the pictures. If your only looking for a short term temp co side bed sleeper i think its worth it. The hood was a bit annoying to put together but overall everything else was as basic as it is.
4,Super Practical!,I bought this crib to keep in my office at work when my daughter comes with me. I read a review that someone kept their one year old and figured it was big enough for my six month old. It is big enough for her to lay down for now but it won't be for long. It really is cute and fits nicely in the corner without taking up much room. I do recommend this crib.
1,it was smaller than i thought.,"THIS IS GOING TOO SMALL BEFORE TOO LONG. I'M NOT REALLY SATISFIED. I THOUGHT IT WAS BIGGER THAN THIS. i've seen these in stores and they were even cheaper and they were larger, and i thought i was getting a real good deal,boy was i fooled. margaret creek."
1,I am surprised,"I was considering purchasing one of these for myself ..as a new grandma-to-be or my daughter-in-law but decided not to as the crib still has bumper pads around it! Although bumper pads are still being sold in Canada they are NOT recommended because of the restricted air flow.I teach childbirth, parenting classes in Ontario,Canada & we teach our clients about the hazards of using bumper pads etc.I am wondering if the bumper pads in this product can be removed.Sheryll"
4,crib,"I must say my wife and I was a little skeptical buying a travel crib. However when the crib arrived and we set the items up we were amazed by how beautiful it looked. The following is a list of pros and cons listed below.Pros:Easy to setup ,light weight , easy to move back and forth, travel bag attached, design and colors are niceCons:Seams are not re-enforced so I dont know how durable the product will be over time and has a distinct odor.Overall we are satisfied and the price is good too."
2,Disappointing,"We bought this smaller pack n' play to save on space while traveling and staying in guest rooms. This travel bed seemed pretty shaky and the bassinet never laid flat. As he got older, it seemed to get too small too fast. He wasn't even 6 months old before he was cramped in the bed and waking up frequently at night because he rolled into a wall. It's already hard to travel, and we didn't need his temporary bed taking away even more precious sleep.If you just want something to have around the house, I recommend the full sized pack n'play. I feel like I have gotten my money's worth in the 8 months that I've been using it. It's also just fine for road trips and doesn't take up too much room in the trunk of our Accord."
4,I LOVED IT!!!!!,"Pros: The weight limit is higher than most bassinets and pack and plays with the bassinet insert. Most of those only go up to 15lbs. This one is 30 I think. My baby weighed 8lbs 10oz. at birth. She was able to use it up to 8 months. It is very sturdy, not shaky at all. Well made. Even after she could't use it as a crib anymore, I took it with us when we traveled and she was able to sleep in it with it set up as play yard. She used it like this up to 2 years of age. The price is more affordable than most bassinets and play yards. It folds nicely, comes with case. Easy to clean and wipe down, etc.Con: the only con I could think of is that I could only find the sheet in stores that sold it. Like Babies R Us."
3,Beautiful but small!,I really liked this for my daughter but it is super small! We had it at my dads house for when we visit and with 6months she refused to sleep in this because it was so small that she couldnt even roll over or turn.We used it maybe 5times until she refused sleeping in it.i wish it would have been bigger.now we have to buy another one
2,Not as great as expected,"I registered for this item when expecting my little girl. I found it to be the perfect in room sleeping solution as it is compact enough for small spaces yet wider than your standard oval shaped bassinets. Unfortunately, my daughter did not take to the product very well and I can see why. The mattress is a very rough almost cardboard type thing that supports only a fitted sheet that you must order online. The sheets for the pack and play are the most rough and scratchy sheets you have ever seen. After my daughter was almost two months and began to move more in her sleep I would often wake to find her head up against the meshed sides. She stayed uncomfortable and therefore could never get a good nights rest in this thing. The toys are pretty pointless too, they aren't much to look at. Although we have failed to get any benefit out of the sleeping portion of the crib lite I am going to at least see if she takes to the bassinet once she is sitting up."
5,LOVE IT!!!!!,Love love love this play yard. It is perfect. It is nice and small and can go anywhere with you. My daughter looks so perfect in it and it is super cute!
4,VERY CUTE...,"THiS iS A VERY CUTE & LiGHTWEiGHT iTEM...VERY EASY TO PUT TOGETHER..!! i DON'T REALLY CARE FOR THE CANOPY OR THE HANGiNG FLOWERS THAT COME WiTH iT. MY LiL GiRL iSN'T HERE YET, WE ARE A FAMiLY WHO WiLL BE TRAVELiNG A LOT SO WE NEEDED SOMETHiNG EASY LiKE THiS. i THiNK THiS iS A GOOD STARTER BASSiNET ALONG WiTH PLAYPEN UNTiL SHE OUTGROWS iT. i RECEiVED THiS iTEM iN A WEEK FROM THE DATE OF ORDER, LOVE THAT..!!"
3,Basic pack n play,I wanted to go much more expensive for the softer textures that other models have but my daughter talked me out of it. If I had to do it again I would have went for quality over price. This product is sturdy and will get the job done and is great for those who are on a tight budget. It is a great bargain and value for the price.
5,Best Choice for a new TV,"I looked at lots of TV's and decided the SONY flat screen tube TV's were the best picture short of HDTV. I liked the 36"" model but I found the 32"" model to be just as appealling and at a lower price. I think the extra size doesn't add much. And 32"" is a reasonable size for most rooms.This TV supports Picture in Picture, favorite channel functions, and stereo sound. Hooked up to a decent stereo, you have a compact home theater that would please anyone. Later on when the price of HDTV comes down and you want to upgrade, this TV would be great moved to the bedroom or elsewhere.Pick one up and you will not regret your decision. Enjoy."
3,Cheap B-movie fun,"If you like a few explosions, and Richard Moll chewing scenery as a B-movie villian, then this one is for you. It didn't stink as badly as I thought it would, but that's not really praise, because I had extremely low hopes for this one. If you can find it for a dollar or two, you may get that much enjoyment from it."
1,Don't waste your time,"""Galaxis"" is the second worst film that I have seen in my life. The acting was atrocious. The sets and effects were more appropriate to 1970's Dr. Who. The characters were one-dimensional and the plot was predictable. The only thing lower than my interest level was the budget for the film. The only redeeming feature is that this is a convenient way to get a good look at Sylvester Stallone's ex-wife Brigitte Nielson.For those of you who are curious, the worst film that I ever saw in my life was 2012:Doomsday (This is the Christian end-times garbage that should not be confused with the History channel's Doomsday: 2012 or the mainstream film ""2012"", both of which I thought were pretty good.)"
4,Not As Advertised!,"I would give this product a 5 star rating had I gotten what I had originally ordered. I bought this for my niece online because of the picture featuring a bright red hopping ball with ""Dora AND Boots"" but what I received was a ""pink"" ball with just Dora on the front. The style was exactly the same otherwise. If there are COLOR & assorted PICTURE features for this product then that SHOULD be specified so we are aware and can make a decision based on that rather than surprising us- whether or not it is a pleasant or bad surprise!"
3,very disapointed,"I bought this ""hop a roo"" for my daugher's 3rd birthday and I wasn't happy with it at all. The ball is exactly like the picture on this web, however it's nothing like the picture on the box. On the box it shows a much bigger ball that has a different handle and a texture like the big excercise balls you can get. it shows a little girl hopping on it and her feet dangling with all kinds of room. The box doesnt' list the size of the ball on it. My daughter is a peanut, she weighs only 24 pounds and is just under average height for her age. She hated it. It is too small for her and it's going back to the store. The only plus is that it is probably durable and the picture of Dora is cute."
4,Improved my score by 120 points.,"The reason I recommend this CD is the practice tests and the vocabulary builder. When I took the GRE the first time I had reviewed my math and practiced my vocab, but I was not used to doing the problems in a strict time limited environment. This CD has practice tests that mock the real GRE, so you can get used to working under a time limit, and answering the questions on a computer. The vocabulary builder was a real help too. It is a game where you try to match the words with their definitions in a limited amount of time. The only problem I have with this software is it comes off alittle cheesy and childish when you do some of the lessons. Other than that, its worth using."
1,Not fit in place and not fit on Audi,all time it become move from position later I fiend it not fit on my car Audi TT 2003 at all
4,"A Good Book for Pictures, but not for Information","I saw this book at the Freer and Sackler museum in Washington, DC and wanted it simply for the fact that it covered so many different types of ukiyo-e. This book showcases ukiyo-e depicting the theater, depicting sexual relations, depicting nature and man's interaction with nature. It depicts the many different aspects of the Edo culture, which is what attracts me to ukiyo-e.That being said, while I love the pure quantity of the images and the variety of artists (try finding a book about ukiyo-e that shows a few artists other than Hokusai), I wish it had more text. Not text explaining the art or artists, but text regarding the natures of change that were occurring in Japanese society at the time. That information really deepens the beauty of this art form.I do like the discussions included in the book about the process and mechanics of creating ukiyo-e."
4,Dont drop this book on your foot--OUCH!,"The eternal search for the perfect art book with lots of high quality, large images. This book is predominantly images, with little supporting text. Which is just fine by me. The bredth of this book is its selling point. Its huge, covering a long span of time. My only issue is the size of the images. NOt all, but some are just to small. But, thats why I have a magnifying glass at hand. If you want to own one really good book on Ukiyo-e, this just might be your best bet."
4,Ukiyo-E,A sumptuous and diverse collection of these Japanese prints that have been so significant in Asian culture and Western art.
4,Love all 3 colors,"I bought all 3 colors of this yoga top. I have had for over a year and they hold their color and elasticity very well. The V neck is very flattering. Only reason it didn't get 5 stars is because I wish it was a little longer (I'm 5'7""...average height). I would buy again, though."
2,"Nice color, but....",I really liked the periwinkle color and black trim but it was awfully tight fitting. I imagine it is suppose to be but it was so much so that it was uncomfortable. I returned it for a refund.
4,Pretty good game for learning about money,"Overall this is as the title says, a pretty good game for young kids to learn about money. It is fun for the kids and they get the basics about lending, interest, bills, etc. I would recommend this game for families with grade school kids, but you need to play it with them. It is a good game for the whole family to play."
3,payday game,"Everything with seller went great. My only complaint is I used to play this game for hours as a child, and it just isn't the same anymore. I think it has changed with the newer addition. Not as much fun as I remembered."
3,"Teaches to count money, not lesson in life.",The game is fun but not a good lesson in spending and saving money. It does teach kids to count but there were way too many ways to win the lottery for it to be a lesson in life. I thought I could alter the game for it to be a little bit more life-like.
4,kids like the game,"I personally liked the original game better. But my children and grandchildren like the updated, revised version more. This game was purchased for my grandchildren."
4,Just like when I was a kid...,"I remember playing this game for hours. Now, playing with my kids is a blast! I like how we can decide how long to play."
5,FUN FAMILY GAME,This game was purchased as a Christmas gift for a 9 year old boy. He loves games and this is our familys' favorite game.
4,A Taste of Life,"My 7-year-old granddaughter and I held a marathon of Payday games after she received the game for Christmas. She loved it and asked me very seriously, ""Is this how life is?"" I think it is good for children to realize that, as my Dad often told me, money doesn't grow on trees."
2,Disappointed,I was expecting the same PayDay game I had as a child. This one is way too easy to make way too much money. The denominations are so unrealistic it doesn't give one a sense of reality (life) like the old one did. I am very disappointed.
2,Not practical,"I have an orginal pay day game from the 1970's. The new game isn't practical. When the smallest paper bill that you can use is a 100.00 bill then it isn't something that the average eight year old can comprehend. I had been using my old GAME as a tool for tutoring a child. He loved the game so I decided to purchase a game for him as a Christmas gift. He was disappointed in the fact that the game was so different. He could count the money and connect it to real money with the old game BUT with the new game he can't relate to the money because he has never seen the money(VALUES) that he is playing wilth. If I had ordered the game for myself or my child, I would've sent it back. VERY POOR AS A REALITY GAME TO HELP CHILDREN LEARN ABOUT THE REAL VALUE OF MONEY!"
3,Not what I expected,"The game that I purchased said Classic edition, but it definitely was not the same one I played as a kid. Half the board is Deals and Found a Buyer and it strongly encourages loans while no longer including a savings option. It seems many more lottery and gambling type option. We plan to modify the board to make it more fun to play, but overall, a disappointment."
5,eye-opener,"Clint Kelly knows how to tell a story. This book allows you to live through what you've always wondered about. Do dinosaurs still exist? And if they do, where and how? God created all animals that ever were on the same day. This book gives us a way to creatively support that truth."
2,its okay,"this book doesnthave much real ki development but it does give an accurate description of the meridians and some korean history. i could be meaner and say that the book is ripping u off because u can find the same information and better ki development in other books,and i just did, but that would be somewhat offensive.keep in mind that because the author doesnt know his information is not top quality he should not be looked down upon for it. just like i may be wrong and should not be looked down upon for it"
3,Not Mr Shaw's best work,"Having read the excellent Warrior is Silent, I was dissapointed with this. The book is a worthy introduction to Traditional Chinese Medicine but most of Mr Shaw's work here can be found in any text book on acupuncture."
5,Read This Book!,"There is so much nonsense surrounding Ki -- in the movies, in books, in magazine articles. This book has none of that. This book presents a Straight-Ahead approach on how to understand Ki, develop it, and how to actually use it in every day life. Read This Book!"
5,Awesome!,"Great sound for the price. 100 watts in each channel including a 100 watt sub provide endless bounds of volume! Good clear high ends which can be DSP'd so as not to sound harsh. Mid-range is clear, but can be reduced by a ""loudness"" button if so desired. The sub is very quick and provides clean low end sound. Be advised however that the sub does distort under extreme circumstances! Overall a very good system and simple to use. One thing I did not particularly like was that the wires for the surround speakers were not long enough!"
1,"Avoid this product, Avoid Netgear","I wish I had researched Netgear more thoroughly before I bought my wireless gear from them. I regret it. Despite good editorials, their products break down with astonishing regularity. My first WPNT511 was bad out of the box, the next one broke down in under a year. If that isn't bad enough, their scripted, plastic technical support seems to be designed more to deliver infuriating platitudes and block the customer from getting any meaningful resolution to their problem (that might cost Netgear an extra penny) than to be sincerely helpful.Consider this a ""danger sign."" You may choose to ignore it, but be ready for the consequences."
1,DOA - dead on arrival,The adapter was dead on arrival. Too bad the Belkin Pre-N's are not available anymore.
1,Bad equipment & Amazon customer service.,See rating of bad RangeMax 240 router and Amazon's changing horse in middle of stream. Amazon agreed to send return authorization paper work on 9-14-06 and this has not been received even after a second request. The response I received today wants me to jump through hoops to return even though 9-14-06 response did not require this. Today is 11-05-06. Bad customer service from Amazon!
4,"No complaints, slightly complicated to set up","My internal wireless adaptor on my laptop was dying so I was recommended this product by someone on an online forum. So far it seems to be working fine. The only trouble I had with it was that it seemed like the software for this card and my internal wireless card could not be used at the same time, so I ended up having to uninstall the old wireless card before I could use this one, which was slightly more complicated than I would have liked in terms of setup. But overall can't complain."
1,Don't buy NetGear,"This is the worst cardbus I never seen in my life. It's even worse than my old old cardbus. Can not connect to any of wireless, even I next to the router."
4,"great card for power users, works well w/ matching router","I got this card and the matching rangemax router, and both were up and running quickly, and are as fast as my wired connections. I did have some rough spots on the card installer and wizard, but with a little fiddling I was able to work it out. For the price (you can get the card and router together for a song on either Amazon or Tiger), I couldn't be happier. But given the number of people who have had problems w/ the wizard, I'd suggest it's best for people w/ medium to high knowledge of networking. For those folks, it's really hard to beat this deal. If you don't feel comfortable in manual configuration of wireless gear, I'd go with some other product."
5,One of the greatest books on the DEs,"I was on one of these DEs and I did not know all of the things these great little ships did,it made me proud to have served on one."
2,Starbuck Coffee Not sold as advertised,"I have purchased this coffee from Starbucks store and it was great, however what I received from this purchase was not even in the same bag as shown and the coffee not nearly as fresh.When I opened the new bag from Starbuck it was rich & oily and smelled very good, however the bag I purchased here the beans were very dry and the smell barely smelled like coffee. We were disappointed and will likely only buy direct from Starbuck now."
3,better after open a few days,When I first got the product it was exceptionally strong when used as the directions stated. After about a week of the bag having been opened it mellowed a bit but I had to use about 2/3 of the amount suggested. My husband still does not like to drink it so after I have used up two pounds I will get another flavor.
5,FASTER,"If your doctor tells you NOT to elevate your heart rate, DO NOT WATCH this movie! It moves fast and will totally enthrall! Read the cover before watching to understand what's happening. Dwayne Johnson in one of his best roles! ACTION, ACTION, ACTION! Where's my pills?"
5,Wow,"I feel if you liked 4 Brothers, Taken.......or simular Revenge movies, you had better add his one to your collection!:)"
4,A personal story of revenge,"I really enjoyed this movie. Although I am no fan of The Rock, I really enjoyed his portrayal of a man seeking justice / revenge for the killing of his brother. He and Billy Bob Thornton acted quite well together. The movie was very realistic."
3,Standard action fare,"The Rock appears in this action film about a man involved in a robbery, after which his brother was killed. When his prison sentence concludes, he seeks revenge on those responsible for his brother's death. During his pursuit of those whom he seeks, there is a hitman after him, the reasons for the hitman being hired being unknown to the audience until the film's conclusion. The men that are being pursued are primarily flawed criminals and the character portrayed by Dwayne Johnson has redeeming qualities, so the audience is not asked to invest any moral assessments, but the mystery of the hired assassin elevates this slightly above your standard revenge movie."
3,Violent,"Read other reviews for in-depth analysis of the plot. I just want to give a few thoughts.I saw this movie at the theater last night. I give it 3.49 stars, rounded down to 3. There are lots of bullets flying and just violence in general, some of which is very disturbing. The acting was pretty good. I thought the best acting was by Billy Bob Thornton, with Dwayne Johnson in a close second. The story was somewhat predictable at times and unpredictable at other times. To me, this movie had some elements of The Terminator and The Running Man and other action movies.If you like violent action movies that have lots of gunfire and high speed chases, then I recommend this movie. It's not a great movie, but it's not bad, either."
4,An Adrenaline Rush of a Movie,"Johnson's performance is one of seething rage camouflaging emotional scars as ugly as the physical ones. Packed with car chases and shootouts, yet includes some unexpected twists and character depth. A very entertaining movie."
3,Entertaining enough action vehicle,"Faster doesn't offer much in terms of explanation as it begins, nor does it have to. After a man only refered to as Driver (Dwayne Johnson) is released from prison, he goes on a vengeance-driven spree with no remorse and little emotion involved. On his trail are two cops (Billy Bob Thornton and Carla Gugino) and an ego-centric hitman (Oliver Jackson-Cohen), but even they can't derail Driver's mission of revenge. The more that Faster reveals as its story progresses, the more interesting it gets. That being said, the more that Faster progresses, the more predictable it gets too. Still though, Faster delivers in terms of solid action set-pieces, and you can't really ask for much more than that. Not to mention that it's good to see Dwayne Johnson in an R-rated action movie instead of more family-friendly fodder, even if the film's script squanders most of Johnson's charisma in favor of an emotionless demeanor."
2,"Not worthy of the ""Rock""","Love Dwayne Johnson and action films of all kinds and he's done some great movies--but this isn't one of them. He has so much more to offer than the monosyllabic--executioner presentation he's given to work with here. And the other ""stock"" characters Billy Bob Thorton as the drug using, dirty cop & Carla Giano as his too tough to be believable partner, don't make the movie any better. The best character in this film? The black Chevy Chevelle Dwayne drives around in killing people--the car Rocks!"
1,terrible movie,good actor but the rest are poor actors and poor director poor writer should of been better blah blah blah
3,"decent movie, but not worth seeing twice!","This movie has The Rock in it, so that alone makes it worthy to watch...He does a good job in his acting role, even though he does not talk alot in it...He also looks the part, with his awesome buff body...However, this movie could have been a lot better!Simply put, there just wasn't enough action! As the previous reviewer stated, The Rock mostly skates through the movie Mad, Distraught, and the actions scenes are decent at best. When there is action, anyway...Also agreeing with the previous reviewer, I think this is the right type of movie for The Rock to be in, but there needs to be more content, action & more of The Rock kicking butt!The Rock needs to do more Jason Stathem type of movies... A LOT MORE ACTION...The Car that The Rock drives in the movie ROCKS!!!!!!!! I want one just like it...I would recommend waiting for the DVD release...Thanks"
3,"Good,simple action","This is a good simple fast paced action movie, Dwayne ""the Rock"" Johnson does a good job of not talking much, what follows is decent revenge movie with car chases and shoot outs. This is the kind of movie to put the DVD player one evening eat some popcorn and pass the time. Not great, but pretty good."
3,Faster,"Though the movie is true to Dwayne Johnson's form of acting. It ends on rather a sour note by not completing what he had set out to do which to kill everyone associated to killing of his bother. And like so many other movies of this sort,it ends on a question mark. Just once I'd like to see a movie end with a conclusion of what does the person do after completing their intended mission. Do they: Get caught and return to prison,or escape to a secluded place start to live out the rest of their lives,or go on the run as a fugitive,or discover love and become passive never to kill again.What happened to his girlfriend,the one that ratted them out in the first place. Did she die of an overdose,what about the detectives son,what happen to him,was he awarded to the state,did he just up and run off.There's too many holes in this movie,though Dwayne Johnson is a good actor for thesetype of movies,he should read the scripts a little closer and demand changes."
4,Action.,"I did like this movie, but I have seen Dwayne Johnson in other movies that were much better. This will not be one of those movies that I will watch over and over again."
3,Not his best,"This movie was okay, typical story line, kind of like walking tall. It have good action and a cool car, and was definitely worth the 4 dollars I paid for it. If you like the rock give it a try, if not then I would say to pass."
3,FAST 5,THIS MOVIE IS GOOD BUT NOT AS GOOD AS FAST 5. I HAVE WATCHED IT ABOUT 3 TIMES SO FAR. THE ROCK IS GOOD IN ALL HIS MOVIES
5,I love this movie.,"This is a fantastic throwback (modern) 70's flick. This means fairly violent, decent action, very little nuance in the plot, and very little dialogue (only to move the story forward). For the most part there are no surprises because characters act the way you'd suspect they would act; also there is no real ""good guy"" in this movie.It's a great movie if you're into these kinds of movies and can deal with a modern ""gloss"" (as in it looks (is filmed) better than 70's movies of the same genre). This isn't art it's a popcorn flick. There are lots of these types of movies being made currently (most of which are awful) however, this is great because it maintains the spirit of the genre."
2,Dissapointed,Dissapointed in this movie.I was expecting it to be way better since I like most of Dwayne Johnson's movies.Unfortunatly this is one of his worst.The movie was boring and I didn't like Dwayne's character.I guess it's not his fault but I do hope he get's better scripts in the future and get back to playing more likeable characters.The only good thing about this movie was the cool car.Only for hard core Dwayne Johnson fans.
2,Average Action Movie,"Dwayne Johnson (Driver) after being in prison for 10 years gets out of prison and starts to hunt down everybody on his list who killed his half brother. There are two people who chase him: Billy Bob Thonton (a cop about to retire) and Oliver Jackson (a hitman).I did not care for the music, especially in the beginning of the movie. The script was sparse. And way at the end when Driver was shot in the head, because of the metal plate on the back of his head, he survived it. That part was too much to swallow for me. But the plot and the acting was good.There was lot of action, but not much of any special effects."
2,"Should've Been ""Faster"" Than What It Was","Going into ""Faster"", I expected an 80's style action movie. What I got was a pretty boring crime drama, which is a genre I'm not a big fan of. There's a twist at the end that I found surprising, but that was the only surprise I got from this movie."
3,If only the Rock did not have to speak.,"I think this is a good action film and I do like the Rock Dwayne Johnson but man oh man he really needs some acting lessons. The Dwayne Johnson looks tough as nails and like he could take on 5 guys and win but can not pull off any emotion other then anger. The rest of the cast is great and this could be part of the issue since we have all these good actors along side one very bad actor, it just stands out more. Billy Bob Thornton pulls off his role as the junky cop with a checkered past and Maggie Grace is great in her role as hit man number ones wife.Lots of action and a twisted up mystery is why you should see this film but most will figure out what is going on faster then they should. I myself like to guess what is going to happen and am always happy when it do's not go my way. Ignore the Rocks bad acting and see this film anyway, it's worth it."
1,Boring-er!,"This movie was well below what I expected it to be. Big, buff, great actor like the Roc...his talent and physicality were totally wasted on this film. I've made it through about 40 minutes of the film and just had to turn it off. I may finish watching it today. Much of the beginning of the film covers the Roc walking around, with little to no dialog, shooting people then walking away. From the starting scene to about 30 minutes in, I think he says less than 10 words.The action sequences are all over the place. The storyline jumps around alot, and the movie just didn't flow like a typical action movie. Worst movie ever!"
1,No menu or language list,I rented it from Redbox and Family Video a couple of times and received both same results. No menu. No language menu I can access to for captioning or subtitle. And pix was freezing at times. Makes me wonder if the company made bad job on dubbing DVDs for this movie. I can wait till the cable will giving a showing. I can't rate the movie itself. But I give the DVD makings a zero!
1,WHAT A CRAPFEST!!!!,"DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME ON THIS CRAPFEST! THIS WAS THE WORST MOVIE I HAVE EVER SEEN!!!!!! Blehhhhhh! the who movie was full of extreme, gritty violence. He just goes around killing all these people. i hated it. if they had given the Rock's character more empathy, it would have been better. But he sure did not bring anything to the role. Even though I hate that sleazebag Billy Bob Thorton, I felt sorry for his character at least. No so with The Rock."
1,Utterly bendable,"I'm used to the malleability of pewter, but this was ridiculous. Bent all-to-hell just from normal wear. Wouldn't suggest to a friend."
4,Purpose built,They are what they are. Bought these for stone and plaster work. They are basic rifflers and are good for beginners to use
2,Not as expected,This set is poorly made and ais so course as to be almost impossible to use. As usual you get what you pay for.
5,Just fine,These work just fine. Nothing like a couple of hours with a wood rasp to cramp up the bicep and make you wonder if you damaged the bones in the palm of you hand. They were both fine a few days later.
5,A ++++ cordless,"Ive had this phone for several years now and it is the best phone I've ever seen. It is clear on both handset and base unit, the answer machine is clear to both the caller and listing to message on other end. I can go for 3 1/2 to 4 weeks on a single charge before I need to put handset back in charging cradle. Answer machine has toll ctr. which is also nice."
2,"Does not wash/dry well, already torn",I would not recommend this product. I have 2 of them as I have 3 year old twins. The sides you tuck in are EXTREMELY THIN and so unless you really get the sides tucked in tight under your mattress they slide around and you will need to reposition them every morning. The absorbency is okay to pretty good which is why I gave the product 2 stars. The worst is they do NOT wash well. Both of mine have tears where the pad portion meets the tuck in sides. The tuck ins are made of such a poor/thin material that I realized you could actually tear the stitching if you were trying to tuck them under the mattress! But this occurred in washing and drying. I wash and dry on permanent press as well. I would not buy these again. I bought them approx. 3 months ago.
3,"some amazing facts, but visually dull.","Lauber's _An Octopus is Amazing_ is a decent introductory book on the topic, probably best suited to children aged 4-8. There are no photographs. The book is illustrated on each page with color drawings. The drawing on the book cover is indicative of the quality of the drawings throughout. It's a bit cartoonish.There is little organization to the subject matter. Instead, the author just presents one (probably ""amazing"") fact after another, such as: octopuses change color, octopuses can lay 200,000 eggs, etc.I think most children, if given the opportunity to pick another book on the subject, might not choose this one, simply because there are no color photographs. Still, it's a decent guide to the subject for young readers and the even younger read-to children. The amazing facts in this book just might prompt them to seek out other octopus books. That wouldn't be so very amazing."
2,The Urban Design Handbook,"I was extremely disappointed in the book. I was expecting a book to learn from, but found that the whole thing read like a sales pitch / qualifications for the firm that wrote the book. I think if I had paid more attention to the fact that the ""author"" was a firm, I would not have bought it.It is geared toward residential development, rather than overall urban design issues."
4,Solid Technical Reference,"UDA's Urban Design Handbook is a good reference for architects, planners, community activists, and real estate developers. Gindros and Co. explain how their firm designs neighborhoods and towns is a wide range of settings.Folks who are in this business will appreciate the step by step approach which extends right down to UDA's conventions for organizing slides and computer files. -always a challange in a collaborative work environment.The book grew from the firm's internal training material. If your approach to design differs from UDA's, the Urban Design Handbook is still a valuable framework for developing your own tools for communicating the mechanics of your firm's technique and vision to new employees effectively.John AndersonChico, CA..."
3,Thoughtful book,I really enjoyed this book and Jacobsen's perscpectives. One must remember though that his main experience is with the city of Missoula. It does encourage me to think about my surroundings and the importance of interacting with people.
2,step-by-step learning? NO,"This is not an introductory book, definately not for students who are new to OO programming. It's for experienced programmers who wants to learn some object oriented concepts. It is more like a documentation or a handbook. Not a good choice if you want an easy to follow text. Might be useful for referencing purpose."
1,Impossible to read,"This book is absolutely hopeless as a text for university students, its obvious target audience, given Rist's occupation as a lecturer. This is more suited to highly experienced individuals.This book is a poor attempt at demystifying the Eiffel language... a language used rarely, if at all.Not happy, Jan."
2,Yawnfest.,"The only good things this pretentious band put out were the early 7""s and At Action Park. You can take a dump on the rest )Terraform save a couple tracks, 1000 Hurts)and this steaming pile. Signature sound? Not too sure on that, Albinis metal guitar/pick set up sounds nothing like it did on amazing tracks like Wingwalker. Please, someone try and tell me this and the last two albums were anywhere near as good as that track.This album reminded me of their ""Futurist"" LP, which was boring too. Id rather hear Albini harp on about houses full of garbage 'with the doo-doo and the feces on the wall' than keep this. Too bad, I like the album cover art."
3,"not as bad as my brother says, but still.....","if you still 'really' like shellac after 13 years, then...... you will like this....i guess. i haven't really cared about shellac since 'at action park'. the two early 7""s 'uranus' and 'the rude gesture' are what i turn to when i'm in the mood, but i keep up with what's new. ""i'm"" bored with this, but i wouldn't say it's a bad album, like say....... '1,000 hurts'. In general the shellac sound hasn't changed. The album sounds like somewhat inspired mediocrity 'to me', but like i say..... it's been 13 years.....and they've never been my favorite band. ok....adam....i'm yawning."
1,"Great live, terrible on record!","As always, Shellac is a GREAT live band! On recorded media, they just will NEVER translate! ANYTHING post Big Black or Rapeman, (except for 10 whole songs, see At Action Park Review) is absolute, plodding, boring, repetitious CRAP!!! The only decent songs on THIS hopefully LAST wasted piece of vinyl are ""Steady As She Goes"" & maybe ""Spoke"". Steve Albini, with Shellac, has become parallel to just what he abhors most, a mainstream big label music group, who gives you an album with just one good song on it! He should just stick to playing live, and not record anymore, just engineer, & he'll get the most unique ""indie cred"" anybody on this earth could ever enjoy."
1,Cobain ashamed,"Nearly detestable in its lack of originality and insulting from a too-jaded tone, the once influential group, now old and in need of hip replacement, definitively proves they are of little more use then milking a rare hard hitting riff."
3,Smaller than expected....BUT a really strong magnet!!,"I'd give it a five star, but the bowl is smaller than I thought it would be -- not the fault of the seller -- the description on size is accurate and if I'd looked at a ruler I'd have a better idea of how small it was."
5,Power of Empathy: A powerful book,Dr. Ciaramicoli has accomplished the very difficult task of sharing himself and his clinical wisdom in an extraordinarily well written and usefull book. The Power of Empathy provides clear insights into how to better understand one's self and one's relationships. I have found the book valuable to me both personally and professionally and have recommended it both to family/friends and patients. The information is so clearly stated and helpful that I hope The Power of Empathy will be read by many. It is one of the best books of its kind that I have come across.
5,An unusual glimpse into this hidden power,"This book offers, a mix of laughter and tears as the author guides the reader through human experiences both good and bad. We are exposed to the possibilities that lie within all of us through the power of empathy. I found the honesty of the author refreshing, allowing readers to see him as another human being, not just a by-line on the cover a book."
4,big but not as good as I thought,"When I first purchased this TV the first thing I thought was that is was great to have a 32"", however size is not everything and it is true for this product. The picture quality was excellent, but the sound was not quite as good as I thought. Also this TV is rather expensive, but having just won the pools I thought I would trest myself. Go and Buy this beast of a TV NOW!"
4,pooh episodes,"Here are the episodes for this DVD:*Apirl Pooh*Whats the score, pooh?*The good, the bad, and the tiggerAND*bubble Trouble"
2,Scary for young child,"We ordered this Pooh and another one for our 3 year old. He only periodically watched DVD's we have gotten for him, and these are pretty tame. We thought we would have a winner with Winnie the Pooh. We were very wrong. We were very surprised that the DVD's put our son in tears. They are very chaotic and actually kind of scary. We will stick with Kipper, Elmo and Noddy for now. Pooh will go on the shelf for a couple of years."
1,A poor odds player,"Turi fails to have hits that even statistics say he should have. He posts predictions on newsgroups for ""windows"" and then has a book to cover the days that his windows (which have never been defined) do not cover. All he can make are vague predictions of no value. Last Thanksgiving he warned people to not fly, and yet he has flown during one of these warnings. Last Thanksgiving was the safest on record for that holiday making one wonder if the reverse of his predictions comes true."
1,Not real astrology,"The only thing resembling astrology in this book is his use of full moons to try to predict events that are extremly vague and useless. I am sorry that I wasted money on this book. I also did a little research and found out that this ""Doctor"" bought his degree for $150 from a diploma mill. Turi gives astrology a bad name and he should be ashamed of himself."
1,"Turki, you always have that handy dandy list on file","The list of these supposed thousands who sing your praises, but only in email to you. You never find them singing from message boards, book review sites, newsgroups, or much of any place else, excepting your emails that you are so willing to forward. How convient that you are kind enough to remove their email addresses before forwarding to avoid verification!"
4,dinosaur lover,"This book doesn't have a lot of pages, but my 8 year old grandson loved it. He is a dinasaur lover"
5,Great !!,"Yes, I would recommend this item. It arrived as advertised, on time, safely packaged, and I had no issues at all.I would def do business with this company again.Excellent product !! -Jim :-)"
5,"Perfect for revolver with 8"" barrel","This is a great rug for a larger revolver, this size fits my 8"" barrel perfectly. Good quality, excellent padding, overall a GREAT DEAL!! Accessory pocket is a bonus, perfect for sight adjustment tool, etc."
5,Better than Raffi,"The gifted musicians at the Old Town School of Folk Music provide a refreshing variety of rhythms, voices and languages as they perform children's standards. The upbeat arrangements are superb. Songs are performed in English, French and Spanish. The musicians engage the children, referring to them as ""wiggleworms"". The best children's CD I've purchased for my infant daughter. It wears well. I'd love to purchase more children's CDs from these folks!"
4,Loud but not as loud as expect,This will definately give theives a nice surprise but it's not as loud as I expected it to be. I might purchase one or two more to make sure that it gives theives a good ringing in their ear if they decide to sit inside my ride.
3,"More about ""Other Secrets"" than ""Companion Planting""","I was a bit disappointed in this book. There were some references as to what plants complement each other, and what ones are used to repel certain insects, but those references were too few and buried deep within certain textual descriptions of various plants. Many, if not most, plant references did not even have companion planting information. Then there were the chapters referring to cosmetics, fragrances, and skin care that better belonged in a health and beauty aid book. I will be looking for a different book to supply my needs on companion planting--but this time will preview the book at a bookstore or library so I know what I am getting."
1,Save yourself some money and buy a different book on companion planting.,"This book was extremely disappointing. Based on the title, you would expect that this would be chock full of neat examples of plants that you could combine for maximum effect. You would be wrong.What this is, is a dictionary of plants and gardening terms, from acaia to fence, scientific names to yucca. Given that ""companion flowers"" is a section in the beginning of the book and was a whole page and a half, I am flabbergasted as to how on earth they came up with this book title. I actually checked the title page to see if perhaps the printing company had glued the innards of one book to the cover of this book. No such luck.If you want a dictionary of flowers, there are plenty of other places you can go, with full color plates. If you want to learn more about companion planting, find another source. This is about as worthless a book as I have seen in a while."
