1,All That Glitters is Not Gold,"As an Artist, Filmmaker, and music fan who experienced Glitter (now called Glam) Rock firsthand, I was greatly disappointed. The film is not intended to be historically accurate, and that is the only thing good that can be said- it achieved a great level of inaccuracy. The Bowie and Pop characters are so thinly veiled that they become parodies rather than representations of the time. Trust me folks- Glitter was not this shallow. The acting is wooden, the representation of the era laughable, and the original music for the film was horrible. The only good thing I can say about this film is that it used many Eno, Roxy, Pop and Reed songs. Forget Velvet Goldmine- buy the original albums."
2,Overwrought but the music's good,"As a big bowie/t.rex glam fan I was excited to see this film, but I have to say I was very disappointed.First, it's TOO LONG (and I fast forwarded through probably 15-20 minutes combined). It's VERY melodramatic and there's little if NO PLOT. Jeez, Mr. Director, PLEASE stop the annoying slow motion segements - especially the bad love scenes - there is no depth to this movie! Also, for a movie set in the 70's, why cast a Kurt Cobain lookalike in a main role? They may as well as had him wearing a T-shirt that said ""think about me, kurt cobain and 90's grunge"" in every scene. The plot twist that the film ends on should have been the main story...instead, it's never developed.I did like the main character, so it's too bad that the rest of the characters are either, overwrought, shallow, or lack development (except the girlfriend who was also good). The music is the only reason I don't give it one star. It's good even if the movie isn't."
2,I'd like to thank...,"This film owes a lot to Roger Daltry and the Who, Jim Morrison and the Doors, Ken Russell, and even Orson Welles. There is nothing original about this -- derivitive is too much of a compliment. Yes, three of the four leads do a fine job -- I exempt Bale -- Toni Collette is fine as always, but otherwise -- don't waste your time."
4,Great new age musical,Great film. The new age of musicals. The music was outstanding with the video type movie. Loved it!
4,A Rich and Electric movie!,This movie tells the story of British glam rock in the early seventies and you will notice the main character has a definite David Bowie look. The story is colorfully told with great actors and music. I think everyone should try this one.
5,Beautiful,"This movie has forever changed my views on life. It's a truly brilliant movie, and I recommend this to everyone. Besides having three yummy U.K. guys (Ewan McGregor, Jonathan Rhys Meyers, and Christian Bale), the story was truly original and quite moving. I can't say too much without giving it away, but let's just say it's in my top ten favorite movies."
3,Beautiful and Entertaining,"I was surprised because I don't usually like these types of flashy films but I enjoyed Velvet Goldmine. It's an intense yet relaxing film that you can watch without having to actually think. It's hard to explain but this film actually takes you in so far that you'll question if your sober or high. The set is amazing, the custumes are shocking, the actors are dazzling and the stage performances are wonderful. VG does have some problems though. The plot is loose and there are some slow parts put in for filler. This is not a film for everyone and certainly not for kids or teens. If you are offended by drug use, homosexuality, drag queens, men who challenge society's idea of sexuality, obscenity and male frontal nudity then do not watch this film. Anyone else should enjoy."
5,A must see...again and again and again...,This movie goes beyond words among other things. I walked out of the theater speechless. The performances were great. The costumes and sets were magical...and the MUSIC! It is a beautiful movie in many ways. Haynes is brilliant! You really need to watch this movie and watch it again and again. It started a whole new obsession for me...
4,a well awaited glamrock tribute,all i can say is that the costumes were AWESOME..a valiant tribute to the era of glam..(that's still beats in the hearts of all of us) very interesting characters and worth the watching..did i mention the COSTUMES?
3,Good but not great,"It's been awhile since a real rock and roll movie came out, so I've been looking forward to this one. For the most part, it lives up to expectations, glittering music video style cinematics, outrageous clothes, great music. If you want eye and ear candy you'll love this movie. However, sometimes the plot gets buried in all the style, and the constant flashbacks make it difficult to follow. This doesn't matter as much as it sounds, for this type of movie image IS everything. I do have one slight warning. This is not a family movie, it has much nudity and many sexual scenes. This is the type of rated R movie that is definately for adults only."
1,Good casting and wardrobe.....that's it!!!,"I had such high hopes for this movie! Glam Rock! Bowie! Iggy! But, all I got was a attempt at Citizen Kane that went absolutely nowhere! With all the glowing reviews on this page I can't help but wonder if they saw the same movie. Even Bowie himself panned the film in a recent Spin article. Oh well, I guess I just not hip enough to get it."
1,I wish I could've given it a zero.,"Anybody who knows anything about the era and its prime movers will scream with frustration at this confused, muddled, preposterous, overlong, pretentious (and not in a 'good' way)hideous grandstanding abortion of a film. I hope Jonathan Rhys Myers never features in so much as a daytime TV show ever again."
1,Oh So Boring....,"How can a movie about such a fun and interesting period be so dull? This movie will put you to sleep. If you're too young to remember when glam-rockers like Bowie appeared on the scene and use this turkey as a guide, you'll be left wondering what all the fuss was about."
4,Citizen Kane is glamrockin&#65533;,"This movie is like a mixture between Citizen Kane and a docudrama on 1970's music and subculture.The glamrock star Brian Slade(!) fakes being murdered on stage, and on the top of his career. Ten years later, a journalist gets the task to find out whatever became of Brian.It's about rock, fame, dreams, ruined youth, homosexuality.Brilliant acting, not least by Ewan McGregor, one of contemporary cinema's greatest talents. Good effects, dream sequences and so on. The story, however, is ""far out""..."
4,The Emptiness Behind the Glitter,"I fault this film only for sacrificing character development for style. It's a visual feast, but for those of us who came of age during that time, it also captured the spiritual barreness of the time, when image substituted for meaning, as expressed by the glam singer to the journalist/runaway. The young actors are superb, especially Ewen McGregor as the Iggy Pop parallel."
3,Outstanding work by Ewan McGregor,"I feel in love with Ewan McGregor in Trainspotting like everyone else, and when he became O'b one in star wars I though I could not love him more. But his work in this movie removed all trace of all other characters and stretched his acting muscles. I saw only 'Kurt Wild', I heard only 'Kurt Wild'. The movie however could be better. I would have preferred a straight storyline movie about Glitter Rock and its pioneers Brain and Kurt, than the flashback telling though other characters. Hence its low rating. I recommend renting before buyong."
2,Does a Good Job Evoking the Glam Rock Era But Who Cares?,"I vaguely recall Todd Haynes' film ""Safe"" from 1994; it was a strange but compelling movie starring Julianne Moore. As for this ambitious failure, it does a good job re-creating the ""glam rock"" era, though that's not a particularly interesting period in rock history (despite the nice costumes). But I have to admire any movie that rips off ""Citizen Kane"". Ewan MacGregor makes an impression as ""Curt Wilde"" (Iggy Pop?), but I never really got hooked by the whole story of ""Brian Slade"" (David Bowie?). Still, it's always a treat to see the lovely Toni Collette."
3,Good but didnt fully live up to my expectations,"Although this was a good movie, I was a bit disapointed with it. It started off well then by the end it seemed to have lost its artsy fantasia fairy tale ideal that made it so captivating at first."
2,"I give it 2 stars, 1 for subject matter and 1 for effort","Those who actually grew up during the original glam peak and followed it closely, generally don't like this movie. I give it a positive review for content and effort, but the movie is deeply flawed . Any attempt at bringing a sense of what it was like during the reign of Iggy, Reed, Bowie, Mott, Roxy, Eno, etc. deserves at least one star for subject matter. The movie's flaw is primarily it's heavy handed anger toward David Bowie for not participating in this ""glam fantasy"". Bowie wisely sidestepped this film. It may come as a surprise to some, but just as the Beatles terrific music was the catalyst for what made their accompanying cultural impact possible; so, too, was the brilliant music of those mentioned above (particularly Bowie)that which made ""glam"" possible- not the other way around. I remember it well. Ironically, in fact, many who thought the music was the best they'd ever heard, completely turned off to visual/cultural subtext."
2,How Did Anyone Get Away With This,"Todd Haynes should have been massively sued by the rock stars hedepicts in this film as ""ficticious characters"". C'mon, it's clear that Kurt Wild is Iggy Pop and Brian Slade is David Bowie, and his ""Maxwell Demon"" personna is clearly Bowie's Ziggy Stardust period. These character even perform music from the guys they are supposed to be. I think the ficticious artists should have performed original songs only that were written for the film. The other thing that bothers me is that the whole glam period is depicted mostly as a ""gay thing"", and all the male characters are shown frequently hopping into bed with one another. The inclusion of some other great music in the soundtrack (Roxy Music,T. Rex, Eno, Lou Reed)while all cool, kind of left me with a bad taste in my mouth, feeling like a great disservice was done to the memory of some of my favorite artists in their prime."
4,Two good parts that give it 4 stars,I haven't seen the whole movie but just the parts I want to see. Such as... Ewen Mcgregor making out with Johnathan Rhys-Myers How hot is that!!!! It's great! and then to see Ewen Mcgregor ALL OF HIM bouncing around just mmm ehhh droooool yummmm eee whooo who cares about plot when you have TWO GUYS MAKING OUT?!
1,Ewan McGregor-Christian Bale....ooohhh yeah!!,"I'm sorry, if they gave me a choice to give zero stars, I would. This was the most messed up movie I have ever seen. I love Ewan and Christian and I was excited to see that they made a movie together, but I wasn't expecting TOGETHER! You have to be either an alcholic or seriously stoned to even find a story line in here. True, seeing Ewan and Christian in the full monty caught my attention, but that's about the only part that did. I gave it a chance by watching the whole thing, but it just got stupider and more confusing (which didn't make any sense because I didn't understand any of it from the begining). If I was you, stick with American Psycho and Trainspotting, they are both still messed up, but at least they make sense."
2,"Noble effort, ultimately a waste of time","This movie has a nice premise, but the flashback narration idea is old and over-used. Rent it, but don't buy it."
2,yikes,"well, I thought this movie was gonna be good and it sure wasnt. there are some great rock music in here I might add but Jonathan Rhys-Myers really chews up his part and the scenes hes in and it got way boring seeing him pint after McGregor's character(who shouldnt of showing his frontal parts in the first place). both McGregor and Christian Bale are smashed in this movie"
5,The soundtrack is the best!,I only saw this movie once (it played in a really small theatre in Houston) and can't wait to rent it when it comes out May 11th! I loved Placebo making a cameo appearance in it. I loved the makeup especially! Glitter to the max! And girls...Ewan is completely naked in one scene. *grin*
3,Eye candy in a good way,"The movie is fluff, but it's beautiful fluff with fantastic costumes and a great soundtrack. Have fun spotting the many, many, many obvious visual references to David Bowie's posters and albums!"
5,AMAZING,"this is one the best most unique films i have ever seen. the music in the film is incredible, you will love it! this is an electrifying over the top film starring ewan mcgregor of trainspotting and jonathon rys meyers as ( maxwell demon) who does a fantastic job playing who i think is suppoused to be david bowie. its right on the money with bowie/rys meyers clothes, hair , actions , singing , dancing- he does an amazing job of portaying him and the 70s ( glam era ).your taken back to the 70s glam rock era and shown all sides of maxwell demons life. it also has the reporter christian bale from ( american psycho) who does a excellent job as the fan/reporter who trys to discover who maxwell demon really is! this film grows on you and you will want to watch it over and over again and you will love the songs!i definetly recomend this to anyone who loves good music and likes a meaningful film.BUY THIS TODAY!"
3,What Just Happened Here,"This movie was good, but i am still confused by it. I am not sure what happened to the main charactor, or his aquantences. I was also unprepared for some of its, ummmm graphic ... tendencies. I enjoyed it none the less. It had a good soundtrack, flamboyent costumes, and larger that life charactors. It truly opened my eyes to the era of glam rock."
1,Weird - Strange - Don't Bother,"I showed this DVD to several of my friends last weekend. We were all expecting a fantastic experience considering all the great reviews this movie received. Boy, were we disappointed! The music is overbearing. The plot - extremely thin. The characters are so poorly presented you don't care if they disappear. Ewan McGregor can be such a great actor. This movie was so much fluff it was hard to distinguish him from the feathers so predominate in some scenes. See Transpotting - A much better flick!"
1,SIMPLY TERRIBLE!,"There are HORRID movies out there, but this one takes the cake. Being a fan of Bowie and Eno, and having read good reviews of it, I was anxious to see this film. However, after watching it, I wondered what movie those reviewers who gave it all those stars had seen? It certainly wasn't this sad, bleak,, wretched mess of a film! The plot is completely awful, leaving some fine actors looking mighty foolish as they trudge their way through that godawful dialogue! If I were Bowie, I would hunt down those responsible for this abomination and beat them to DEATH with a platform shoe! Do not waste your time on this thing!"
1,Cave In The Mine,"What does space aliens, Oscar Wilde and glam rock have in common? Absolutely nothing! And that is what this movie is worth. Yet the director tries to make you believe they are related in this story.The music didn't merit listing to and the same goes for much of the dialogue. Too many ""flashbacks"" for both of the major characters made the movie seem disjointed. It starts out in the 1800's then jumps around the 1950's, 60's, 70's and 80's.Put this on your ""Do Not Buy"" list. Don't even waste your time renting it!"
4,Oscar Wilde is an Alien!,"At least, according to this movie! It opens with a UFO in the sky and Lady Wilde finding an baby on her doorstep. It matters because the pin found on his blanket changes hands throughout the film, first found in a schoolyard by young Jack Fairy.This is an art flick about the 1970's glam world. I discovered in watching it how little I actually knew of that world; I knew 1980's glam, which is a whole different ball of wax. It's about Brian Slade, glam star who staged his own death in 1974 and then disappeared. It's about his boyfriend Curt Wild. And it's about a reporter investigating Slade 10 years later, a reporter who turns out to have been intimately involved in the story.The reporter is played by Christian Bale, also known as Lindsay on TV's Angel. The odd thing is he plays a Brit, while Ewan McGregor's character (Wild) is American.If you are one of those people who is considering seeing this just for Ewan, I have three words for you: full frontal nudity."
5,"Eye candy, ear candy, mind candy","Beautiful and appealing on all levels. Ewan McGregor as Curt Wild on stage is brilliant and breathtaking. A very beautiful screen kiss between Brian and Curt (""The world is changed because you are made of ivory and gold. The curves of your lips rewrite history.""). Innovative and intelligent screenplay, though perhaps just a bit too self-consciously so. All in all, a brilliant piece of work. You either love it or you hate it."
3,Image Never Completes You,"I think that one of the main themes of it, to me, is that no matter how much glitter, fame, and fans that you have, u can have just as empty of a life as anyone. To fill the missing void in his life, Slade slept around with many people, missing the part about love, which is the only thing he needed. One doesn't know for sure if he really fell in love with Curt Wild. One of the most impression leaving scenes was when Slade(who yields great talent and beauty) and Wild kiss, the noise fading out beneath them. Then, the cameras explode with millions of pictures being taken, and their horrified expressions say it all. The soundtrack is a very rare treat, especially Thom Yorke's singing. The film wasn't eye candy to me, it seemed very dull in many parts. But the scenes where nobody said a word stayed burned into my mind. An extremly interesting and tragic movie, when you read between the lines."
4,EXCELLENT MUSIC AND 70'S KITSCH,"Don't expect a fully comprehensible plot, or that you're going to become well-acquainted with the characters, who stay as ambiguous as their respective sexualities. What you will get is an amazingly alluring portrait of glam-era London and some great music (any movie that kicks off with Eno's great ""Needles in the Camel's Eye"" deserves special praise). Ewan MacGregor is smashing as the Kurt Cobain-Iggy Pop hybrid Curt Wild. MacGregor and Christian Bale have a sex scene, imagine that! ""Velvet Goldmine"" is shallow, but nevertheless great fun."
5,I LOVE THIS MOVIE!!,"this film just blows my mind. i went to see it because i like Ewan and i just sat in the theater eyes glazed loving every second.when i get this movie i won't leave the house for a week.it's that good!you have to watch it if you haven't. that's all, behold the glitter!!"
3,Fortunes of War,This book was a good read just as are all O'Brians books. I did not like it as well as many of the others. It was not as action packed as the others.
5,Patrick Obrian and Jack Aubrey - don't plan on sleep!,"I love Patrick Obrian and the Captain Jack Aubrey series - I've read every one and this is arguably the best! Start with any one, and you're hooked, particularly if you start with THE FORTUNE OF WAR. Patrick Obrian ranks at the very top of historical novelists. I would put him smack dab on top. When reading, savor every word - Obrian makes his words and sentences as good as the plot."
1,Simon Vance lacks ability in making the story real,"For anyone who loves to listen the O'brian's novels read with eloquence and great vocal characterization, go for Patrick O'Tull's version. Seriously, he is much better than Simon's insipid performance."
5,Amazing...................,I Have never been a fan of Anime but something got me to buy this Movie. The Moment I saw This Movie I was In Awe. These Series are Impossible To Describe They are One of The Most Beautiful and Artistic Films I Have Ever Seen. I Can't Wait For The Rest Of Them To Come Out. Highly Recommended.....................
5,David Kellogg's Big River,"David Kellogg brings alive the experience of living in one of the most interesting cities of the world - New Orleans. Like Mark Twain, he paints mental pictures with his words that literally jump off the page. All of this imagery combined with a fast paced suspense story makes the reader eager for the next work from this outstanding writer."
4,What a treat!,"Since moving away from New Orleans years ago, I have forgotten many of the wonderful sights and sounds of the area. This book brought it all back in a delightful and entertaining way. Thank you, Mr. Kellogg."
3,New Orleans lovers shouldn't miss this one,If you are from New Orleans or familiar with it and the intrigue that goes in hand you need to read this book. It takes you along with a realistic story that could happen here. It was an easy read for me and thoroughly enjoyable!
5,S.O.S. A first hand review from a survivor :,This book is indispensible to an employee who is beaten down by the corporate world for reporting a violation in good faith of unethical or unlawful matter . I was cast into the stormy sea of politics without a hope of survival until I was tossed this book; my only life preserver in a corrupt world.Regards and my respect to the author ;
2,Not necessary,"This book was not very helpful. The first couple pages give you an idea as to what steps you need to do change your name, but the rest is forms that are outdated or not useful. For example, they say that you can mail your passport in along with your marriage certificate and you'll get issued a new one with your new name free of charge. As of September 2005, they've actually changed it where you still have to send those things in, but they charge you the regular passport fee. As long as you know that the first things you need to do to change your name is to do your Social Security Card and then your Driver's License, you'll be okay."
4,great box set,This is a great set. I never really bought any of these cds over the years because most were imports and a bit pricy.... Now with this set you get all the cds at a smaller price. I'm not really a live cd fan (hence only 4 stars) but Jeffs performances are somehow different. He was truly talented.
4,Give it a chance,"I never give anything 5 stars because i always see room for improvment. But anyways, I am a musician and some of these pieces are so tranquil its like knocking on heavens door. At first this wasn't what i was really looking for, but after time and like alot of the cds i have acquired i took this one close to my heart. To sum it all up the guitart playing and the singing remind us what real music sounds like and that it's not all lost in this era of commercialism."
4,Basically for hard-core fans,"I've been obsessed with Jeff Buckley's music for almost 8 years. So, I didn't hesitate to purchase this. However, I already owned everything in it. If you're a silly fan like me, you'll consider it worth just for the pictures and neat way the boxed set it put together. However, putting out these singles and promos this way lessens the values of what I already owned."
4,"I live on the river, I wonder if the dam is still there?","The first 200 pages of this 632 page book was so detailed that I wanted to just get on with it. The last 400 I could hardly take a breath or put it down. I know the country pretty well but someone unacquainted with Canyon Country needs the introduction to get a sense of what is here. Accurate science and geography, a very mature way of removing what Ed Abby could have only raved about, GLEN CANYON DAM! I have met the author (it is one of our llamas on the back cover) and I didn't realize how talented he is. Recommendation: Read the book, See the canyon."
4,Oh no...not another twenty-something girlband!,"Once in a while you find yourself struggling behind your desk fighting daily demons and all of a sudden something different grabs your attention. This was the case with Wonderwall's Just More. It's a simple, sobre and fragile song that grows from begin to end. It happens rarely, but I totally fell in love with this uncomplicated song. A small gem..."
5,"My Campaign Finance ""Bible""",This is the best one-stop reference I've yet found on federal and state campaign finance rules. It is updated and well-referenced. I use it every month and rely upon it.
5,One of the best,"This movie is truly a great movie. Anyone interested in Pool/billiards/9 ball than this is a movie for you. Tom Cruise is amazing in this movie and Paul Newman isnt far behind. If you haven't seen it the give it a go, you will be glad you did."
5,"""Great Film!""","With the two leads, Paul Newman and Tom Cruise, ""The Color of Money"" is one of the better films of the 1980's. Director Martin Scorsese directed this follow-up to the 1961 ""The Hustler"" movie that also starred Newman. Here, Paul resumes his role as a fast-talking pool shark, but this time he has a good-looking and intelligent protege to whom he teaches the ins and outs of how the game is played. Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio has a supporting role as Cruise's girlfriend, but even more than the portrayals what makes the film is the outstanding script written by Richard Price.""The Color of Money"" won Newman a well-deserved Best Actor Oscar in 1986 with the movie ultimately grossing an impressive $76,000,000 at the box office.This film is available as a stand alone DVD, but is also packaged with Tom Cruise's 1988 feature ""Cocktail"" in a two DVD set."
3,Color of Money Blu-Ray got short-changed,I absolutely love this movie and have seen it many times but always thought it needed a clean up and could use some supplemental features.I rushed out to buy the Blu-ray edition on 05Jun2012 but alas I am still waiting for those changes. The visuals could still be more sharp. The disc is bare bones. It would have been interesting to point out the older real pool pros who were briefly in the cast for example and maybe something on the famous pool stick used.It wasn't a waste of money to buy this edition at the right price but I expected more. I can hardly believe releasing this on Blu-Ray but not going further because the movie certainly deserves it.
3,"Great movie, Poor DVD","The movie itself is great. However, the DVD is of poor quality. It does not have any ""extras"" either."
1,New Bluray Video Butchered.,"If you care about this film at all, run away far and fast. Somebody botched this disc so badly it almost has to be a mistake. It's an incredible shamethat a film that earned Paul Newman accolades and an Oscar, is among Scorsese's best, has an excellent performance by Tom Cruise gets this kind of treatment. Hopefully it will end up like Gladiator and Gangs of New York that somebody will acknowledge that this isn't what was approved and the realintended Bluray will be released. Everybody knows about the John Carter debacle and how much money Disney probably will lose, but butchering a classic LiveAction film isn't the way to recoup either money or reputation. Multiple end-users and professional reviewers have been appalled at this attempt andhopefully once Scorsese gets a copy he and his people will throw some weight behind getting this abomination fixed.I only wish I could give this 0 stars or worse."
4,A young pool shark learning from an old hand,"""The Color of Money"" earned Paul Newman an Academy Award for Best Actor, and Tom Cruise plays the role of confident Vincent Lauria. The film follows-on from the 1961 movie ""The Hustler"", which Newman starred in. As Lauria the viewer is able to see a more ruthless, cavalier side of Cruise's acting skills. Reprising as an older Eddie Felson, Newman offers the sensitivity of a wise tutor to Lauria, but he proves to be a high maintenance protégé. They go their separate ways, and come up against each other in an organized competition, which makes for some interesting tension. The experience though gives Felson a spark that's been missing in his life, and Lauria's empty philosophy leaves him the poorer. It's an entertaining film with two very different character personalities constantly playing off against each other.Nicholas R.W. Henning - Australian Author"
2,Apple screws me for first and last time,"Well, I got the laptop on time from Amazon. Good job by them.Ok, now to Apple. It's not even 1 month after I bought the thing and they upgraded it. That's lousy. I heard that upgrading a computer and selling it for the same price without warning is a constant ""feature"" of Macintosh computers. But..less than a month of use and already there is a memory, wireless, and video upgrade? That just plain sucks. How about charging more for more? Hello-If you like losing customers...Just keep up your current practices. I changed my mind from buying a PC for this Mac ...but I'll never do that again. Back to PC's for me. Great policy Apple!!"
4,A book to better understand object oriented programming,"This is not a book to learn java from, nor is it even a good reference. Read and understand the title before buying this book.This review refers to the previous edition to this one.I found the text ordered well, with most examples clearly explained. There were some minor bugs in the code which a beginning java programmer would struggle with.After finishing the book, and running the examples, and working through several of the exercises, I found that I understand OOP much better, and of course understand java better too.I've noted several people who don't know java syntax are frustrated by the book, as they are expecting to learn java from it, and are never reaching the point where they will learn OOP or java from the book.In conclusion, don't buy the book to learn java, buy it only if you need to learn OOP and are having difficulty doing so."
3,Nice,Good sticker for Yoda fans which makes me one of them. It glued nicely on my Car and does not fall out
5,Classic humor from The Usual Gang Of Idiots,"Funny stuff from the early days of Mad. The crisp b&w art in this 50th anniversary edition looks great. Handy paperback size. Be sure to check out the 1st volume of this series, ""The Mad Reader""."
2,No longer worked after 3 months,"Nice looking Christmas decoration, but it failed to work by the time we put it away. We probably only played it less than 5 times."
4,Fresh perspective on positional chess,"I picked this book at a recent Malaysian local PCMM open in Kuala Lumpur. I was interested in the title having read ""Excelling in Positional Chess"" by Aagard.The chapters started with analysing chess space: Strong Weak Squares, then continuing to Files / Diagonals, 1st and 2nd ranks and outposts. The other chapters discusses specifically on the strenghts/weaknesses of each piece: King, Queen, Rook, and Minor Pieces.I admired his excellent analysis as he is able to illustrate the pivotal square(s) being subtly fought for, and the possible variations. Remember these are GrandMaster vs GrandMaster games and not Amateur vs Master. For those still stuck between 1500-1900, I believe this would be good book to rub off ""grandmaster"" techniques on your play.However if you are still being caught with opening traps, and knight forks; you are probably under 1500; you should look at other beginner books.Malaysian Chess tournaments - watch out for me this year !!"
5,essential reading,I wouldn't hazzard an idea without first understanding it. SS isn't intended for everyone except purhaps once best read with mathematics and logic
4,Life Lines,"I picked up Life lines not knowing what to expect from a book about someone elses health problems. A poetry book about Parkinsons Disease - doesn't sound like what I want to read. But Tony Edey has an upbeat and positive outlook on his life and his health. His poems are funny and poignant all at once, and always written from a positive point of view. His wife, Iris Edey, has done wonderful drawings of flowers that compliment the poems and that lend, through their symbolism, to the life Tony draws through his words. There are tough moments and some telling photos, but mostly, this book celebrates life and finds joy in small blessings."
1,Strap too short.,"The forward strap is at least an inch too short to fit on my Stoeger Double Defender. And, no the shotgun does not have an exceptionally large stock."
3,Would be ok if it fit,"I'm not sure what type of gun they used for the picture, but this is a lot smaller than it shows, and the rear strap even though it's elastic, would not fit on any of my stocks (too small). I had to return it."
2,Public Domain publishing,"Wilde's work must be in the public domain--this is one of those sloppy, cheap editions put out by a publisher whose only address is a website. I thought I'd made certain this was not the case when I ordered it, but obviously was in too big a hurry and did not. It does provide Wilde's text--with typos and everything left-justified. It's cheap and the typos are occasional, but I wish I'd invested the extra money in an edition produced with care."
5,The traditional side of Mongo Santamaria,"If you are used to the fusion and jazz oriented Mongo then this album presents the other side of Mongo: traditional Cuban setting. Is actually two albums in one, the first is a conjunto ensemble doing some terrific sones, cha-chas, etc. the other is a traditional rumba setting. Both are great but the rumbas are among the finest on record with great singing, feeling and of course 'Mongo en el quinto'. My favorite ""Agua Limpia Todo"" with the great Carlos Embale, Merceditas Valdez and el Viejo Macucho."
1,late shipping,I ordered this item two day shipping and it has been over two weeks and now is when it says that it will ship. I'm no longer in the US please contact me at my email to give my out of the country address.
5,Norman' s New World Cuisine,"An excellent and well conceived book. Clear instructions. A master piece in terms of nouvelle cuisine, with an extreme care in mixing spices. I have just ordered two books written by Norman in order to see how he combines tastes and ideas for Latin American and Caribbean Cuisine and Exotic Fruit."
1,"Nothing to scream about, Blan Tasting !!","Okay,I bought a case (4) Jars of this ""Kauffman Pennsylvania"" brand Pumpkin Butter.At first I thought I got a batch of rotten butter due to the 100 degree heat. Bitter Blan taste.Turns out that my 32 year daughter likes this product because It's low in Sugar compaired to the other brands.I find It very Bland, Almost like the canned Pumpkin that you buy to use to make Pumpkin Pies. I had to add Cinnimon to my Peanut Butter & Pumpkin Butter sandwich.No Cinnimon and clove flavor at all. (Bland) !!I myself love Trader Joe's brand. It Bursts in my mouth with Flavor !!I love Trader Joe's Pumpkin butter so much, I just bought a case of 24 Jars at $2.50 a jar. Normal price, Not Bulk price.I see others here on Amazon.com selling the Trader Joe's Pumpkin Butter for $14.50 a jar !!I'm no way affiliated with or nor am I an employee with Trader Joe'sI just love Trader Joe's Pumpkin Butter, Love it !!"
5,Very sturdy and beautiful guitar case,Arrived in three days in very good condition. Very sturdy and well built guitar case. My 12 string fits perfectly. A bit heavy for a smaller person.
4,Solid case.,"The green crushed velvet inside is a classy touch. Some glue that holds the velvet in was visible, but other than that, seems like a solid case. Heavy but sturdy. My boyfriend loved it for his acoustic."
5,Best Swedish Massage DVD,This DVD was great. There are many techniques I have never seen. My clients love them and you will too! It's not a Deep Massage...It's Swedish Massage:)
4,A Must Have !,"One of the most underrated R&B talents -Eldra show nuff knows how to sing a ballad but he can get you up on ya feet too. Songs such as ""Slide"" and ""Can't Get Enough"" lets you know Eldra hasn't forgotten his Midwestern Steppin roots. Rounding it all out is the soulful spiritual titled song ""Heart, Mind & Soul"" this Cd is a must have."
5,A Business Book of Uncommon Candor and Heart,"This is not just one great book, it's actually a couple great books - a business advice title of uncommon candor, a jaunty personal memoir, and an eye-opening account of life as a powerful woman and mother in corporate America. In the interest of full disclosure, Robin was one of my mentors - and this book manages to distill her cool wit, cut-to-the-chase honesty, and keen judgement into one galloping read. If you're a woman in corporate America, read this book - and if you're a man in corporate America, really read this book - Robin's rare combination of fearless leadership, humility and open heart are a model for look-yourself-in-the-mirror career success."
1,More helpful to the author than to the reader,"This book reads more like a personal journal contributing to the author's benefit than to the benefit of people in search of career advice. The sisterhood aspect, professed to be the author's ethic in this book, reads disingenuous at best. But even if she actually walks the walk, it is of no practical value to read about it. Overall, not recommended."
4,Naked In The Boardroom,Excellent reading for any lady that wants to become a CEO or Exec VP. A career changing book to say the least as you enjoy sharing the authors secrets. This book is short & to the point; definite & helpful hints to incorporate into your daily strategies.
3,"Good size and thickness, but little too slippery","This yoga mat was very inexpensive, so decided to try it. The size and thickness is great, but it's very slippery."
5,Totally Pleased,I got this mat a couple of years ago for doing yoga at home. It has been wonderful. I didn't realize that it was so wonderful until my daughter tried to steal if from me and I got her one at a big box-store. Mine is softer and it does better at sticking in place than the other one. I love it! The other mat lasted no time at all but this mat is still going strong!
3,Decent yoga mat.,"This mat arrived really fast and I do like that it is pretty long and very cushiony, also the color is pretty vivid (i ordered the purple). I've had it for about a month and a half and I've used it almost everyday. My problems with it are that it is pretty slippery and it has a very strong plastic smell (I've washed it probably 10 times). I took it to a couple hot yoga classes and it did not hang too well there (Thank Goodness for Yogitoes!), but now I just use it at home and it works pretty well. My hands do slip a little during downward facing dog, but it's controllable. It was worth the price though!"
3,"Okay mat, but a little slippery","This mat was purchased for my morning boot camp class. it does the trick when it comes to padding for knees and palm (lots of push ups), but I do notice that the texture of the mat isn't ideal. It's a little slippery and doesn't hold a firm grip. Often times I have to use my workout gloves. Other than that, it works well and is also longer in length than most normal mats."
3,"Great service, even with a return","The yoga mat (not really ""olive"" -- more of a spring green, but does it ultimately matter?) arrived with a nasty chemical smell that would not go away even after days of trying. I contacted the seller and received the BEST service: an immediate apology (thousands of mats sold and three with this problem)and an offer to refund the purchase price or replace the mat. I opted for the refund, which was handled before I could even say ""thank you."" Terrific service!"
4,"Great mat, not so great ordering result","The Yoga mat is great; however, I ordered one in light green, and got one in turquoise. Seems like that shouldn't happen . . ."
3,Sticky Mat,"When ordering this product I thought the mat would be thicker than it is. It is not as thin as a regular yoga mat, it might be twice as thick even, but I thought it would be spongier. The mat has a bumpy texture which helps with stickiness. It is a good length. Comes in a great variery of colors. Mine was the same color as the one in the picture. Wish it was thicker though."
2,Waste of money,What a waste! This mat has a slippery residue.. perhaps it can be wiped off. I found it impossible not to slide backwards as I was doing the Warrior poses. Save your $12 and get a different mat.
5,Yoga-tastic!,"This is an amazing yoga mat, it's so thick you can see the indentation from where your feet sink in! i have nothing bad to say about it, except that i ordered olive and it looks more like lime green but it's okay, i like that color too."
1,wish I read the people whose hands slid around in dfd,"Cause that is exactly what happened to me on the first day out on Downward Facing Dog. OK for standing poses, but disconcerting on a key pose."
1,Lied about weight,They said that this mat weighs 4 lbs but the shipping weight is 3.5. How is that possible?
3,For the Player who wants everything,"As a big fan of all things Faerun, I am disappointed to have to admit this book isn't a MUST-own. The fundamental difference between this and the free, 3.5-updated Dark Sun info recently published in Dragon and Dungeon is minimal. The fluff factor is higher than I expected and since I haven't gotten into Epic play or Psionics, those additions weren't of much value to me.That said, it's a very 'pretty' book with high-quality artwork supporting some interesting prestige classes, spells and feats. I didn't feel cheated so much as somewhat let down. :-\"
4,A Good Guide Alround,Great Book for zoning in on regional specific characters. Nice new feats and spells and great outline for cleric domains. Will help players better define there characters toward a specific region giving DM's more avenues for roleplay. ++
2,Overpriced and far from comprehensive,"Much of the book is dedicated to updating older material to 3.5, but still requires frequent cross-referencing with your older FR Campaign Setting, races of faerun, and other FR products. The amount of reprinted material can be annoying if you already have it, but the book does a fair job updating domains and prestige classes.Some other highlights include:-New and enhanced regional feats which distinctly outshine their prior counterparts.-New deity specific feats and spells.-Nice deity info-time line updates-Some comprehensive feat lists and region bonus updates-Artwork better than Wizards seemed to have been trending towards.It's a questionable buy because of its sparse content and high price. Unlike the packed FRCS (Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting) which was a great example of an awesome amount of material in a solid package, this product feels rushed and hardly the comprehensive resource that it is billed as. Try and skim it before you decide to buy."
2,Not what I thought it should be,"I bought this book because I skimmed through the first section, where it updates regional feats and requirements, and the chapter on Faerunian updates. I thought that this was a solid book, though a tad overpriced (something we've all become unfortunately used to). When I read the whole thing, I wish that I hadn't taken the time to buy it. Which is why I'm writing this, to try to warn you, the reader, to not waste your time and money. As other reviews have stated, the filler information in this book is weak and unnecessary, without any real meat that I can actually use in my campaign. I have subsequently ignored all the information in this book and continue to use the FRCS as is, making the 3.5 updates as I go, without a thought towards this text."
1,Good remastering of classic Toscanini performances/actually 4 stars,"The Smithsonian Great American Orchestras was a fine series that I missed the first time around. If you can find these, snap them up. This one in particular is a fine example of NY Phil under Toscanini. The recording quality is really about the same as the NBC 8H recordings, if not better, and the orchestra is better. This is a great way to get the legendary 1936 Beethoven seventh. I don't remember a reissue of the Brahms Variations. Toscanini simply lets the piece unfold naturally. With a Rossini overture, the Traviata prelude, and Act 3 Lohengrin prelude, this is a great program of some of the master's favorites. The NBC Symphony collection is fine, too.Buy them all. PS: I have messed up my star rating. Understanding the limitations of these recordings, I still would give FOUR STARS."
2,Zero chemistry,"Set against the backdrop of the Spanish Civil War, ""Talk of Angels"" could have been provocative and sweeping, but it settles for little more than standard-issue Governess Falls for The Rich Guy romance. Vincent Perez has a smoldering presence, but the beautiful Polly Walker is as flat on screen as a Fascist protest poster. The two have little chemistry. The result: a stilted and perfunctory outing. The only saving grace is the always wonderful Frances McDormand, whose hard-bitten, love-struck fellow governess offers a sad little bit of zest."
2,Can I have my two hours back please?,"I absolutely adore Vincent Perez. I think he's an amazing actor, I love some of his other work and he ain't too bad on the eyes, if you know what I mean...(See La Reine Margot and Indochine!) However, this movie was a drag. I am an avid movie fan, but this was the first time I had ever really noticed the effects of bad casting and NO on-screen chemistry. Nilch. The scenery was beautiful and the cast had great potential, but the weak script, underdeveloped storyline, and the director's awful attempt at the occasional ""artsy"" camera shot drove me nuts. I felt no emotional attachment to the characters or the passion they SHOULD have had for each other. Such a waste! See this movie ONLY if you need a quick Perez fix or if you have too much free time..."
2,for die-hard vincent perez fans only...,"i have to say i was pretty disappointed by this film. afterseeing indochine, queen margot, and le libertin, this vincent perezfilm was a sleeper! not only is the dialogue stilted and undeveloped, but the different accents kinda threw me off. (vincent perez speaks decent spanish--but his english is tinged with a french accent while the rest of the family speaks english with a spanish accent!) the actors make a valiant attempt at salvaging the movie, but the result is a cheesy, overblown, wannabe epic. (it's almost painful to watch mary and francisco interact.) while the scenery is gorgeous, there are other films with far better stories, character development, and dialogue. try belle epoque (with ariadna gil and penelope cruz) or le bossu (with vincent perez) for a better representation of these actors' talents."
3,"Good basics, poor illustration, incomplete","This book offers some basics as to types of fabric folds and falls that one would encounter in trying to draw a draped figure. While the writing is lucid though incomplete, this book suffers from a serious flaw of terrible prints of drawings of such folds which do little to elucidate the writing in a substantial manner. More illustrations would have been helpful, as would have been covering close focus photographs of the draped figure as painted by some of the masters excelling in the same. It would not be possible to master or even come close to mastering the aspect of drawing fabric folds on the basis of this book"
2,examples poorly printed,"As I was reading this book I kept thinking this must be a reprint of something written in the 1950s. The writing style had that cumbersome approach of much older 'how to' books. In fact the book is a reprint of another book called ""The Seven Laws of Folds"", and I suspect it was orignally a book meant for sculptors. The examples are charcoal(?) drawings. Most of well known statues. The descriptions really don't seem to apply to drawing at all. I tried looking through the eyes of a would-be sculptor while I read. Only then did the book seem useful.Unfortunately, I have another complaint. The example sketches are, well, terrible. Many of them I could not make out. There are photographs in the book as well that are so badly reprinted I really have no idea what they're sposed to be.There needs to be a better book to help people draw 'the draped figure.' This one really doesn't help."
1,This book is NOT the original,"Unfortunately this book is a poor representation of the original, a hardcover that was printed in 1942 and has better representations of the drawings.If you are an artist or art student, it's worth it (even if more expensive), to find the older, 1942 hardcover version for the finely detailed drawings that are shown clearly and full sized.Save your money by not buying this cheap paperback....! :)"
3,"OK, but not great","Bridgeman is an indispensable teacher of human anatomy (even though he worked in the early 20th century), but this isn't the best book out there. The drawings are too loose and sketchy to see clearly what he is describing. He goes through the seven typs of folds all right, but they need to be illustrated more three dimensionally. I'd choose this over Hogarth's book, though, because Bridgeman's written descriptions are to the point, and at least the drawings aren't overdone. And it's [inexpensive]. The world cries out for the definitive book on drapery: one that is concise, accurate, and with good drawings. I saw one once on a guy's desk in an animation studio, it looked like it was written in the '50s, but I can't remember the name; it had superbly elegant drawings and lean, no-nonsense explanations of the 7 folds. I made some copies, but not of the title. Oh well, Bridgeman will have to do."
1,Illegal and shoddy,"This item was created for charity only, in a limited edition, sold through my website and at my shows only. Whoever is listing it is doing so illegally, and manufacturing it illegally. Please don't buy this item here; it's available at www.janisian.com instead, where your money will go where it's intended!ThanksJanis Ian"
1,LISTEN TO JANIS IAN - DON'T BUY THIS DVD HERE!!!!,Janis Ian herself let you know below that this DVD was created EXCLUSIVELY for her website for CHARITY. I went to her website and bought the NEW DVD cheaper than it is listed here and it is the original DVD..NOT A BOOTLEG like these. LISTEN TO JANIS!!! [...]
3,Good but Choosing Episodes was a headache,"This used to be my favourite series, but going to next episodes of the series was disappointing ! I mean operating to watch the next episode was unnecessarily complicated, piture quality was ok but not great for a dvd. I give it 3 stars because I enjoyed watching it again after a long time, so I guess I should be thankful that I have it in my collection. A must see ! You will feel some joys and happiness with the movie - Guaranteed !!"
5,a delightfull period minseries,lillie langtry starts of as a tomboy living on the jersey isle but soons uses her beauty and intellegents to be the most sucessfull cover girl in engeland at the time.
2,Not the best of period pieces,"I love the story and remember watching this series as a girl with my mother every week. But now, as I watch, it does seem stylistically 1970'ish in the way it is filmed- almost has a soap opera set feel to the whole series which is just something I find unfortunate. BUT if you find that doesn't bother you so much, then the story is really fabulous and the actors are all good (esp Oscar Wilde's portrayal). The costumes are quite good too."
4,Perfect for beginners.,This GPSr is a great device for those wanting to start geocaching as a hobby. The hallmarks of this device are its ease of use and reliability.
4,Garmin eTrex Legend HCX,I have only used this GPS five times and it is pretty easy to use. It works great even in thick foliage. It doesn't have the compass or altimiter like the Vista which would be nice but is not an absolute necessity. The Garmin maps are a little spendy but compared to other maping software Garmins is very detailed. Overall this product is great.
4,Good choice for backcountry use,"In addition to the HCx I considered the Oregon and Map60. In the end the type of use (mostly backcountry hiking and skiing), size, weight, battery life (similar for the HCx and 60) features and price were the factors that helped me to choose the Legend HCx."
4,"A little clunky, but it works very nicely","Satisfied, that's my verdict on the Legend HCx. Worth the price. The interface is a bit clunky, since everything has to be input using the little joystick on the front, but aside from that... no complaints. It locks onto satellites pretty fast, navigation works great (if you've loaded routable maps), and the display is readable all the time. I've used the navigation function outside the US in Central America, with no problems.The only part that's a bit off is the elevation measurement. You can expect to be 20-30m off most of the time, which is a general flaw present in most GPS units, caused by the angle of the locked on satellites. If you need more precise elevation, I suggest you look into the Vista HCx which has a barometric altimeter. But if you're like most people and need precision mostly on latitude and longitude, this unit should work just fine."
4,expectations not met,"My first impression was great product. After using for two trips the flaws are coming out. First, the base map is so basic it's not usable as a handheld should be used out of the city and on the trail. Plan on spending nearly 100.00 to upgrade maps and use the Etrex. Secondly, the toggle/enter button protrudes out so far that it is accidentally hit a lot. Produst does seem durable and I hope I grow to like it. Garmin does make great products for the car. I guess I was expecting a NUVI type GPS in my handheld.TnTTX"
3,Not sure,"Unit works great, however there is something rattling around in it. Do I send it back or see what happens?This unit has had very light use inside my car.Edit: I turned unit on and gently shook it. The screen flickered and it lost reception.I'm sending it back for a new one :{"
5,Love it.,I have used my new Garmin eTrex Legend HCx and it's everything i need in a GPS Navigator. I would recommend this product to anyone.
4,Good choice for volunteer environmental monitoring programs!,"I would rate everything a 5, if I could easily enter and find coordinates that are not my personal waypoints, or online geocaches. Maybe It is possible, but I haven't found it in the instructions."
4,Great Personal GPS,"I bought this model to replace one I had previously owned. There's nothing bad I can say about this device. However, I have not been able to access the calibration feature on this one like I could on my previous model. I have used it for navigation in several locations throughout the world and have depended on a Garmin eTrex several times. It's easy to use & navigate through even if a person is unfamiliar with this type of device. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a dependable multi-use personal GPS."
4,Much improved model,"I had previously owned an Etrex Legend (about 5-6yrs old) it was okay but had a short battery life, took a long time to locate satalittes, worked only so-so in the woods( new one works great doesn't loose satalittes). Finally the display went out so I decided to buy a new model (much better features) rather then repair the legend. I'm really glad I did eTrex Legend HCx is really great, locates satalittes fast, has great features and battery life is about 25-30 hrs. I aloo really appreciate the USB connection (instead of the serial). I use the GPS for hiking, biking and kayaking. Another plus is that it comes with a bike mount adapter that works with my old bike mount bracket.All in all I really like this GPS"
5,Geocache the easy way!,I bought this unit to geocache with. The ease of transfer from geocache.com to this unit is excellent. It would be a little better with the streets maps added but as it is I am nothing but impressed with the quality and battery life. Geocachers will love!
5,Very Pleased!,I purchased a 2008 U.S. Topo Map and a 2 Gig SD card with this product and I am very pleased with the end result. The basic map on the GPS was practically useless but then I bought the product knowing that. I use it primarily for Geocaching right now but in the very neat future I will be using it for scouting and hunting also and hopefully it will serve me as well for those purposes.
2,this is used as a hand held device,"well you cannot use it when you walk in the mountains and they are not too steep, however do not use it on a bike its useless it will break"
4,Garmin GPS,"Too small to work well in a car but I got it to take out of town and in the field, and its fine for those applications."
2,Disappointment,"Good device, but elation turned to disappointment on finding the supporting software was not MAC compatible, and, therefore, the USB interface capability, useless."
1,do not buy this unit,I have been trying to unlock the city navigator NT that was purchased with this unit. I have tried everything I know. The web site is terrible and trying to email product support does not work. Buy something else. This is terrible.
5,Best total price for a great unit,"I am very pleased. I had an old GPS III plus, and this one is much faster, clearer, and easier to work with. Very happy with the total price being less than anywhere else."
2,Navigator,Not what i expected to hard to set upHard to readWas not accuratetried to use it for land markings
4,Good beginner GPS,Bought this when geocaching was just beginning and it was a good product in its time and served us well. Delivery etc. as promised.
5,Excellent GPS for geocaching,"Was using a very cheap GPS unit from the school. Looked for one that wasn't terribly expensive, but would work in tree cover and be much more accurate in pinpointing location. This one works nicely. I did purchase the road maps for it, so that we can drive and then hike in to find the cache. It's not a unit you'd want to use by yourself when driving. You have to look at the tiny screen too much - worse distraction than a cell phone."
2,"Advertising does not emphasize requirement for ""optional"" maps!","Unlike the eTrex that finally broke after several years use, this new one comes with a ""basemap"" that is for all intents and purposes, useless - nothing but interstates and major roads. Buried in the Amazon advert, there is a warning that optional maps are available, but what caught me is that it DOES ship with MapSource, and MapSource with the older eTrex DID contain detailed maps!I got stuck with having to spend another $80 to get the same level of detail that used to come free . . ."
2,powwow highway dvd,"Powwow Highway is a Lakota ""cult classic"" in the western film genre sense. It reminds us of home. In fact a lot of it was filmed at home in the sacred Black Hills, ""the heart of our home and home of our heart,"" as our ancestors would say about the Black Hills. The film captures a description beyond words. To own a dvd of this film is satisfying. However, to have a poor quality dvd with low quality sound is disappointing. But living on the rez, we cannot be too picky and we are accepting of things we recieve. Thanks for your promptness and I would still recommend this video for your permanent library collection."
5,POW WOW HIGHWAY,I LOVE THESE TYPES OF MOVIES. THIS FILM IS HARD TO FIND. THANKS FOR THE SPEEDY RESPONSE AND FOR HAVING IT IN STOCK.
4,POW WOW HIGHWAY,"This movie kept my attention all the way through. It shows how Indians do have their own humors one after another. They are good at adaptation too, if you know what I mean."
2,Dancing to the Pow wow blues,This movie is a true classic. It is a must see for those who really want to see what Indian movies are about. Better than Dances with Who? or Black Robe. This movie should be seen by everyone. It has many underlying issues of what is happening in Indian country today.
4,"A ""not to miss"" movie","First seen this movie at the Native American Film Festival in San Francisco, Ca. A great movie and seemed to never appear in the theaters. A movie that makes you feel good at the end. Don't miss it, I waited years and just got a copy this last Christmas."
5,How about a Pow Wow Highway II?,"I thought that this was an excellent film! Gary Farmer was my favorite ! He was the only one who had any faith that the ""trickster"" would devert their enemies. He was so cool. I thought he was so funny also when he called his car ""my pony"",...not that in itself is funny,...I guess it's the way he acts or says it. I remember when I first saw that movie on T.V. years ago,...I was going through a bad time,...and it really cheered my up. It was just a good down to earth movie. I hope they make another one!!!"
4,wasnt that bad,"I recently bought and watched this movie because it was made in Mescal Arizona, a place i visit every year on my vacations from Florida to arizona. It wasnt a bad movie, I enjoyed it, kinda like those spaghetti westerns of the old days, but since I love all the old westerns I liked this one too. There are not many westerns made anymore, so you have to appreciate any that come along."
1,This Was a Joke Right ?,"I have seen some good B films and some average, others not so good but this one is in a class on its own. So bad that it has no redeaming quality. Plot? what plot! As for the 7 mummies i counted only two.I think thats right, 2 but iam not sure (becouse by that stage my mind started to wonder, what i had planed for the next day.) The Kung Fu fight scenes with the Mummie/mummies were embarasing to say the least. The Rap music played while convicts walked through the desert and the metal music played during the action(?)scenes was the most horrorfying thing about this turkey. As for the guy who was paid to do not much but laugh, one would have to conclude that he knew that the joke was on the audiance. All in all this film is a mess.Dont take my word for it. watch it for yourself, but you have been warned."
3,Love the story: Absolutely HORRIBLE Quality,"I have this on DVD but wanted to take it with me on a trip. I love the story, but the quality is horrific. Extremely grainy and worse there is a horizontal stripe across the screen that makes everything under it look yellow green. I have seen other pieces made at the same time and they are much better quality."
1,Broken,"Unfortunately, the disc was so tightly contained that my husband broke it getting it out of its packaging. A great shame."
2,What in the world were they thinking about?!?,"They surely weren't thinking about making a quality movie of any sort! This has to be the absolute worst Christie movie of all time. I could have videotaped something better in my back yard -- and, by the way, be ready for that actuality because it looks like videotape and not film. ""Badly acted"" doesn't even come close in this flick. Folks, the only reason I'm giving this one 2 stars instead of one is because the genesis of this film came from Agatha Christie. I've read everything she's written and I don't think she'd be proud of this cobbled-up, aimless mess. Unless you absolutely must own everything of ""Christie"", I suggest that you skip this one and go for the old B&W Miss Marple Series (which was great!). This alleged film is a real dog!"
2,A pity,"An interesting story, but very poorly acted. A happy mystery, very light and colorful, but feels like a bad play."
1,A weak version of an old fashioned murder mystery,"As devoted fans of Agatha Christie and owning many of the Hercules Poirot Series as well as all the Miss Marple mysteries, we wre sorry to see this treated as more farce than murder mystery and consequently found the actors and the acting fluffily light."
1,Dissapointing,"First, let's talk price. 3 mixes (each is 7 minutes on average) for $11 is a rip of. Second, let's talk music. One OK remix of Sleep, which is a great song, but is not made any better by the remix, and two remixes of Tears From The Moon, which is my all-time favourite song, but the two remixes just KILL it. They absolutely ruin the melody, adding beats right where they don't belong. Overall, this CD is a HUGE dissapointment, and I advise you not to buy it."
3,An Okay Book,"I'm sure it will be beneficial to someone because it has a lot of information, but I wasn't that someone this time around. I didn't learn anything new from this book."
4,Mass Communication Theory Class Text,"This book isn't that bad. For a paperback that is maybe an inch thick, it delves itno the stereotype that text books are expensive. the book si easy to read although a bit dry at times. I do not feel the book is worth $70 or more, which is too bad."
4,Fun Read,"I read the Yoga Mamas by the same author and knew I had to read this one when it came out. It's an interesting look at a middle class mom thrust into the social machinations of an upper class preschool. Manhattan preschool is just as crucial as SAT scores these days it seems, with most or all of the burden on the moms to fit in, make their child shine and make the right connections. Along the way Laura stumbles onto a scam and cleans it all up. I enjoyed the look at today's preschools - not the same kind you'll find in Anytown, USA, that's for sure. Stewart's characters are all very interesting and this mystery had me scratching my head till the end."
4,"Funny, light reading","Class Mothers is an entertaining and light-hearted look at super competitive Manhattan preschool culture. It's a combination mystery and ""girlfriends bonding"" novel."
4,fun read!,"I picked up this book when I read that People magazine listed it as one of the hot summer reads. But I think it would be even more satisfying as a back-to-school book. With great characters, a plot full of intriguing twists and turns, and a believable look inside the lifestyles of New York City's overprivileged, this is one of those books that kept me up long after my usual bedtime. (I paid for it the next morning when it was time to get my own kids to school!) While some of the extremes to which these Class Mothers go to are hard to imagine, everything I have heard or read about private schools in New York says that the competition is cutthroat. Insightful and fun."
2,Boring and mediocre,"Fill of cliches and stereotypes, Class Mothers is a boring, mediocre read that isn't really worth the time it takes to read it. I'm glad I borrowed it from the library instead of paying for this amateurish book."
1,Bored in Class,"First let me start off by saying my expectations are kinda low--I'm not looking for ""War and Peace"" here, just a fun, easy-to-read chic lit book that I can read while nursing the baby and functioning on 3 hours of sleep. Lately, I'm into reading about pretentious, NYC mommies, their nannies and their spoiled kids so this book seemed perfect. The sad thing is that this book couldn't even meet my low expectations! It was just so boring and so poorly written compared to other mommy lit books. I expected so much more from this book after the author received such great reviews for her first book, but was very disappointed. Don't waste your precious time."
2,Disappointing,"I had high hopes for this book but it failed to deliver. The characters were poorly developed and none of them felt like real people to me, not even the main character. The writing was transparent - I was never carried away by the story. I was always painfully aware I was reading a story about imaginary people. I expected intelligent writing and this was not. Chick lit is fun and I enjoy fun, frothy novels as much as the next girl but for that I'd turn to Risa Green or Jennifer Weiner who are smart, witty novelists. Katherine Stewart just doesn't cut the mustard."
1,class mothers lacks class,"This is a very superficial, shallow, juvenile novel seemingly written in haste to take advantage of the motherhood boomlet and the success of books like The Nannie Diaries. I would not recommend it at all."
4,YOu can't miss this cd!!,"From beginning to end,, you can't miss a song from this cd. Just listen to ENSENAME...and you will get the chills for sure.. TWO THUMBS UP for this super tejano singer.."
5,Great so far,"Have only used a few times for tea bread and meatloaf, but nothing as stuck to it and it is easy to clean. Wish I had bought 2. Good price and good product."
4,great quality for the price,"This loaf pan is lightweight, perfect size to do a banana bread for example, non stick pan and the baking was homogeneous so... I still have my baking pans that I bough in France or Germany (not cheap at all) but I keep them for some special purposes or occasions. I needed a correct loaf pan for an ""every day"" uses and this one do the trick, and I won't cry my pan if anyone scratch the bottom or ruined it with some experiment (you never know sometime)"
2,Disappointed...,"Bought this DVD because of the spectacular scenes and audio and wanted to see it on current home theater equipment. Quality was poor, with detectable video camera jitter and visual artifacts typical of an old copy of the original film. No FBI warning, so my first thought is that maybe it's a Chinese copyright-infringing ripoff???"
4,"Great flick, poor DVD","The story and the cinematography were excellent. The transfer to DVD was very disappointing. It looked out of focus from time to time, the dark scenes were muddy, and there were film ""remnants"" in the transfer (scratches, film marks). And the sound, while Dolby, was 2.0 which was rather disappointing, too.This isn't too recommend against it, just beware, it isn't the great audio/visual feast that it could be."
2,Nice Movie; Terrible DVD Transfer,"Beautiful photography and a nice story make this an attractive movie for everyone. It isn's just a ""kids' story."" It's a safe film for kids of all ages and a good adventure tale. It also was nice to see Mickey Rooney again and young Kelly Reno was a likeable kid.Now the bad news..... Unfortunately, the DVD didn't do the colors justice, nor was it a sharp transfer. In all, very disappointing in that regard. The audio also is disappointing. You have make adjustments with the center speaker to make it sound balanced.It's a nice film but a horrible job on the disc, so beware."
4,Cinematography and visual storytelling at its best,"If you can get past the labelling of ""children's story"" or ""melodramatic fable"", The Black Stallion has the kind of stunning filmwork reserved only for the grandest epics. The first half of the movie -- about a boy and horse shipwrecked on a small island -- is basically a silent movie. It is a story of friendship and trust that is told without the benefit of dialog. Deschanel's wonderful cinematography conveys both the island's beauty and Farley's storytelling without becoming maudlin or trite. The still photography alone brings to mind Adams, and the haunting score is near perfect for the occasion. The second half of the film reverts back to a formulaic Nerd-wins-Girl, or in this case, Boy-and-Horse-Win-Big-Race, but the performances are superb and the movie never patronizes to its adult viewers. Predictable ending aside, The Black Stallion is an awesome, visual masterpiece masquerading as a children's movie."
5,The best fictional horse ever!,"Ever since I first saw the Black Stallion movie, I've been facinated by horses. I'd say that's the reason why I started working with horses in the first place! The movie is simply beautiful. Ok, it's not exactly the same as the book but it doesn't matter! The horse (Cass Ole) is gorgeous, the island is increadible and the acting is terrific. Who could ask for more? This is the horse movie of horse movies!"
1,Chinese bootleg?,"One star is for the quality of the DVD I received. The movie gets five. Amazon customer service gets five.Received the DVD in packaging with different design than pictured on website. The disc itself was printed with a very basic, one color, title. I've seen this movie dozens of times, so it was immediately clear that there was something wrong with this DVD. The colors of the movie are all washed out and some of the scenes look like they're cut differently. A quick comparison with the version on Netflix streaming confirms this. It may not make such a difference to the casual viewer, but we returned it. Fortunately, Amazon refunded us without making us send it back. I look forward to comparing the Amazon disc to the one I just ordered from Wal Mart."
5,entralling tale of a boy's bond with a horse,"Moving and entralling tale of a boy who comes to terms with his loss and learns to survive with the comfort and love of a horse. Patience is required as it moves seemingly slow at times, but the drama of the story draws you in. Excellent children's movie for a thoughtful child."
3,NOT AS GOOD AS THE BOOK BUT STILL A GOOD MOVIE,"i watched this movie first before i read the book and thought it was good. there are sme amazing bits in it-the horse is so beautiful and so is the way it is put together, with the wonderful sunsets and locations. The main storyline is all you get-this movie does not stay that true to the book-fans of the book will be disopointed, i know once i read it i was. It also gets a bit boring at times, However, i loved the ending and anybody should see it at least once."
3,The movie wasn't that good!,I was hoping for something more dramatic based on what I was told. The movie seems to leave out a ending. It seems as the producer is trying to add mystery with the movie. This movie is still better than a lot of today's junk..
2,Not as good as I remembered......,"I totally agree with the DVD transfer being really bad. But I also think the movie wasn't as great as I remembered when I was a kid. It seemed shorter and not as exciting. I am a fan of all the actors, I wish they had more lines. It didn't hold my children's attention. My daughter (a horse lover) liked it ok. It's a good story and I would love to see them remake it. With the special affects they have now a days it could be really cool."
2,Boring,This movie was very slow and boring. I guess I'm just not the type for watching a movie with an hour of music in it while a boy rides around an island on a horse.
2,"like the storyline, dislike the boy","The boy in here, he is a little... wierd. Every horse book I've read with a boy in it is HORRIBLE. And in this movie, he is so weird I don't even know what the ending was(I didn't finish watching it). Now, Phantom Stallion, or Black Beauty(I haven't watched the movie, I just read the book.) those are good books because they're not about a BOY and a horse. Don't get me wrong, I don't hate boys, I just have yet to read(or watch) a good movie about a horse and a boy."
2,In need of a new transfer,"Everyone knows this is a great story, but this film desperately needs an anamorphic transfer. The problem is not my television. Seabiscuit looks great. The problem is the poor video transfer. MGM, get with it and do a proper anamorphic transfer. At the same time, clean up all the dirt and speckles. You can do better - MUCH BETTER!"
2,Great Movie; Crappy Master,"This is one of the great boy and his [fill in the blank] movies, but deserves a serious re-mastering. It needs to be updated to accommodate 16:9 screens and surround sound. And the transfer itself isn't pristine; there are color-timing issues and quite a few dust bombs."
4,A classic,Great for any age. The scenery is spectacular and the narration from thestallion a perfect way to tell the story. You don't need to like horses either.
5,A Beautiful Film!!,"Filmed in 1979, this movie persists and survives the test of time. It is the classic story of a boy's love for his horse, a magnificent Arabian stallion. They are cast adrift together following a shipwreck, and the boy (played by Kelly Reno) and the wild stallion share a chapter of survival on a desolate island. This is one of the best parts of the film.After their resuce, Alec and the stallion join forces with an ex-trainer who is irascible (Mickey Rooney), and soon they all find thesmelves in a match race with the greatest thoroughbred of the day. This is more than a child's story, and it's a stunning and exciting movie experience. I'd give it a ten if I could.!!!"
4,Great Rendition of a Great Book,"I had the pleasure of seeing the premiere of this film in the NY Film Festival in 1979. What made it especially fun was that Kelly Reno was present, we are about the same age and I got to meet him briefly after the show. I had read the book prior and felt that this was a wonderful adaptation of the imagary in the book. One of the other reveiewers felt it wasn't true to the story, but I have always felt that this is one of the all time best visual adaptations of a book to the silver screen."
5,A must-have for any horse lover!,"If you've read the Walter Farley series, you MUST see the movie! Also a musical pleasure--the score will bring you goosebumps. Cinematography: excellent. This movie is absolutely beautiful. END"
5,The Black Stallion,It is just as breathtaking on my widescreen as it was in the theatre. A recommended keepsake.
2,Not for beginners,"I got this dvd because I was interested in learning how to do tai chi. Since this said it was for beginners I thought it would be a good fit. WRONG!!!! The guy goes through the poses so quickly that you can't figure out what you are supposed to be doing, not only that but when they say to do something with your left arm, he is doing it with his right which made it harder for me to figure out. The camera angles are also not helpful as they will show the top half of the body leaving you to try and figure out what the heck is going on with his feet. What a disappointment. I stopped halfway through because it just got too frustrating."
2,Very Weak Track Selection,"The Orb has a turn on the Back to Mine stage. Can't say this is a winner for the series. Mildly amusing on the first listen, this album becomes quickly tiring due to a combination of weak or very lame track selection (ie. ""Ow Much!"" by Creature, ""Have You Seen Her?"" by Chi-Lites, ""Little Fishy"" by Thomas Fehlmann, and ""Barbie Girl"" by Electric Chairs are all horrible) on the part of Alex Paterson. The only two [relatively] decent tracks are ""Blue Calx"" and ""You Don't Fool Me"" by Joachim Spieth. The mixing leaves a lot to be desired also. Overall, thumbs down on this effort by The Orb.2.5/5 stars."
3,OK,"My Jet grinder (which is awesome) came with great wheels, just not coarse enough. This wheel gets the job done but was a pain to get all lined up and true. Plastic center bushings suck, but that seems to be all anyone is offering for wheels of this size and this coarse."
3,just the top of the beginning of capoeira,Capoeira was not totally portrayed in this movie. But hey who can put all of capoeira into about 120 min. That's almost impossible. But it was a pretty interesting movie that I was really into when I first saw it. It had many spectacular moves and Mestre Amen trained Marc convincing enough to fool a non-capoeirista. To find out more about capoeira go to a batizado or take a class. It's fun as HELL! Make sure you do samba.
4,Good but Corny,"In all actuality, this movie was corny but there are some great scenes showing Capoeira Regional. The only draw back is that the villian of the movie does Capoeira Angola, which in my opinion is pitting the old (or traditional) versus the new.It is however a relatively good movie to show kids who want to know what Capoeira is all about. Or rather who want an idea about what Capoeira is about."
4,GOOD...BUT NOT GOOD ENOUGH!,"This video got me into Capoeira and im very thankful for that! But the only ""real"" capoeirista in this video is Mestre Amen! In the beginning of the video you see Mestre Amen pulling a backflip at one point of the roda and landing somewhere else in the roda...very weird. But its cool enough for people who dont know what Capoeira is too see a little.When I showed my teacher...the only thing he said was that the only good guy in this video is Mestre Amen.Look at the beginning of the video...how many times do you see someone do a ginga??? almost never.Parham"
5,Mark Dacascos rocks!,"Good movie with Mark Dacascos as capoeira mestre. Cool moves and a relaxed story make this movie one of my all time favorites in this genre. The final fight is also verry good, but maybe a little short. I also recommend the movie No retreat, no surrender with Jean Claude van Damme."
2,"All soul, but no life.","When I saw the preview for this moive over five years ago, I was excited. It looked so graceful. When I bought it this year, after many years of searching for it, I was dissappointed. The choreography is gorgeous, don't get me wrong, it's just that none of the rest of the movie is worth watching. The dialogue is trite, and the plot is too far out there. If the movie makers would have shot this as some kind of montage, it would have been better- the movie wouldn't have been as long."
3,teaches real capoeria,"Yes , the movie is b rated, but the movie teaches a good lesson that capoeria is all about. This is a game, hits happen, get up and continue playing. This showed good examples of capoeria moves and styles. The hero was using Regional, while the villiean was using Angola. This is a good movie to watch to get a good idea of what capoeria is."
3,"Unrealistic fights, but good performance","Mark dacascos is a good capoerista, but in this movie there is little ""real"" capoeira. The fights are kindof excessive, because the characters can take several kicks to the head without even bleed or faint. Some good capoeira music and good performance by Mark. Rent it first, it is not so good that you watch again."
2,"4 Star Movie, but the DVD is 2","Where are the special features of this movie? I remember seeing a featurette on TV, why didn't they include that? 20th Fox just slaps the movies on the DVD with no effort and thinks that's ok! Well they are lazy and could have done better. The Reality is we are in the ""21st"" century and DVD has many capabilities to take advantage of. A documentary about capoeira and interviews could have been nice. I hope to see more Capoeira movies with a good storyline. This is a must for your martial arts collection seeing that there aren't many capoeira movies out there."
5,Wonderful movie,"If you are looking for a movie that showcases capoeira than this is the one to see. Actually based on true events, this movie tells of a soldier's return from where he was trained and the trials and challenges he takes on as he strives to make a difference in the lives of others and how that spills out into the community."
3,good picture,Esta Pelicula es del tipo de entretenimiento que toda la familia puede verporque nos dice la importacia de la union escolar
2,Only because it attracts so many new capoeiristas,"I don't understand how people could love this movie as much as some apparently do. The fact that its the only american movie where the hero is specifically a capoeirista does not make up for the fact that the script is horrible and very little of the capoeira in the movie is actually worth watching unless you are completely unfamiliar with the art. For me, this movie was painful to watch. The first roda with Mestre Amen at the beginning was pretty cool, but that's about it. Rent this movie first! Don't buy it only to find out that it's a horribly cheesy ""Dangerous Minds"" with capoeira. If you want capoeira, get Jogo de Capoeira and see much more capoeira and avoid the unfortunate plot of this movie."
5,Great movie,"This is one fantastic martial arts movie.Being in martial arts myself I know Capoeira realistically speaking is useless for self-defense but Only the Strong does an excellent job of making it look realistic.I remember seeing this movie when it first came out at theatres when I was in my teens.This movie is what first brought Capoeira(an afro-brazillian martial arts combining martials,dance,gymnastics and acrobatics)an art with its owh history,its popularity to the rest of the world after so many years of Capoeira's existance.A must see movie if you haven't seen it by now."
1,Lame and unrealistic.,"The plot line, acting and action sequences are all horrible - barely good enough for a ""B"" movie. This story has been used too many times and still glosses over the reality of fighting. Public fights never end like it is shown in movies - vengence and maiming and death are much more a realistic end to physical violence.Further, although the martial art style is exotic and interesting - this is not a fighting system! Sure it may have some distant roots in a camouflaged martial routine - but was and is not a true or even practical fighting system (like Krav Maga or MMA). It takes very little understanding of physics to see that standing upside down on one hand while kicking, is not the most effecient use of balance, weight or speed - all of which are required for effective fighting. Watch something else..."
2,Kinda sad when you think about it,"I feel that this movie was an okay movie because it is about my favorite thing in the world: Capoeira. I feel that the main character would be better if he was a real capoeira mestre, not some Karate Champion. The only parts worth watching are the first and last 5 minutes where you get to see roda in action. I am a self-taught capoeira student and I can play better than the goofs that they put in the movie. It is a good movie for capoeira newbies, but if you really want to know about REAL capoeira, research and find a mestre near you so that you can experience the exhileration of practicing such a beautiful art."
4,Couldn't put this one down!,"Okay, so it's not ""Pride and Prejudice,"" but this is really a fun read. The characters are real, multi-dimensional people, the dialogue is good, and you genuinely want to know what's going to happen next. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because it was too short--I wanted the story to continue!"
2,Robbing the Cradle,"I enjoyed this book, but could not get past the age difference in the characters. Cassie is 19 and Blair is 38. Add four years and we're talking the age difference between my oldest daughter and me. If Fulton had kept the age span closer to 10-12 years or so, I would have have rated it much higher."
4,Steve Hackett last stand,"this double disc (cd-dvd) is the weakest of the series for the dvd content,still great interviews with the band on the making of the album but for the rest of the extras it is weak, very bad bootleg tv performances (the quality is very weak) no promo videos! The music is still great this is the last album with Steve Hackett on guitar. Still a must buy for the hardcore fan."
4,Wind and Wuthering,I am just filling out my CD library with titles I used to have in album format and through the years have lost or they have gotten unplayable. Great album though.
3,best of the enhanced 1976-1982 series,"again, this new compression technique is so disappointing. As I stated in the and then there were three review the compression technique that hurt the 1978 remaster actually showed better results in the new wind & wuthering remaster. hackett's guitar parts are more audible than in the '94 remaster (rumor has it that the final three muted him in seconds out & wind & wuthering - debatable). I actually thought the acoustics were better all around but davis seems to mute collins & banks in order to appeal to today's popular mood of guitar-based & subtle drumming technique that just isn't genesis. again, why pretend that genesis wasn't musically proficient? I just think this compression production has undermined the genesis musicianship & production of the 70s & 80s. It was good then. i think the '94 remasters are far superior."
2,Low quality but functional,"I bought these because Geomag Pro are not sold in the US, and international shipping on them is prohibitively expensive. Compared to Geomag these are very low quality. The metal plating on some of the magnets was bubbling up, and on some it had already flaked off completely, causing black magnetic dust to accumulate. The strength of the magnets is a fraction of the strength of Geomag. I am still able to build with them, but the weaker magnets make some shapes more difficult to put together. The ends of the rods are larger in diameter, making it difficult to build some shapes that require a lot of rods to be attached to one ball. The balls are slightly larger which compensates for this problem somewhat, but not completely.For the price, I expected these to be of much higher quality. If I decide to make another purchase, I will either pay the international shipping on Geomag, or just refrain altogether. I would not get these again."
1,Way to kill self esteem,You can't make the structures shown on the box without growing a few extra pairs of arms and hands. Everything that you make just looks like a big blob.
5,Left side of Hammer,"4 SIDED TRIANGLE is an early example of Hammer sci-fi/horror yet to come. Produced in 1952, it is an acquired taste to be sure, being very British in it's general decorum and language, but definitely well worth looking at and learning to enjoy. Borrowing a theme from METROPOLIS, it recounts the tale of a somewhat mad scientist's creating a duplicate of his best friend's girl for himself. Naturally, he doesn't realize the dangers therein. It also has one of the few on video performances of the poor late Barbara Payton that is worth viewing. Enjoy!"
1,2nd one where the LCD fails,"I bought some years ago the same one but in blue. Some months later segments of the LCD started to fail. The device was siting in a drawer. Then I bought this one because I thought that this problem was corrected but no. Some LCD segments are not working anymore. Also, the screen gets scratched very easily. Not recommended."
3,Oregon UV/Sun Timer,"its cute, got it for my wife , ( its smaller than we thought) and we understood it was waterproof but it blanked out when it got wet ( worked fine when it dried)"
2,No on-off button & expensive battery,The battery cover is ugly and not easy to close. There is no on-off button to save the battery life.
3,Too many features,"This device is sold at a good price and seems to be accurate. The downside and reason for 3 stars is that it has ""featuritise""-- too many feature and menu's that make conflict with the simple task of seeing what the current uv reading is."
3,Submarine Fiction,Harry Homewodd wrote 3 book triolgy on the Submarine service...why in some places it is slow I found the books enjoyable. There were written in the mid-80's they still hold up well...
1,Zippo MPL Lighter,"Would rate less than 1 if I could. SSSSOOOOO annoyed at having purchased this absolute piece of garbage. Rarely lights, have filled multiple times thinking it was empty but it's simply an expensive poor quality lighter. Save yourself money and grief and look elsewhere - anywhere else. Companies should be jailed for making such rubbish just wish I had checked reviews before purchasing."
2,Boo on the awkward childproofing feature!,"Why, oh why do we need a childproofed utility lighter? It is so frustrating. I am an adult who just wants a reliable lighter mainly to light candles so I don't have to breathe noxious match fumes which I am allergic to. So why does Zippo want to punish me by making a lighter that requires me to use two hands to operate it because the child-proof feature is awkward, difficult, & not ergonomic? Regular lighters don't have this dumb feature. If you're going to ""child-proof"" everything, then do it within the bounds of good design & functionality - which this lighter doesn't. I subtracted 3 stars due to this. The 2 stars are because I like that it is refillable (it's so difficult to find a longer utility lighter for home use that is refillable & not disposable so it doesn't end up in the landfill)."
5,Good Lighter,I love this lighter. I burn a lot of candles and this lighter is perfect for that. The flame adjusts easily. I will purchase another one. Note: I also purchased the mini and hated it. The flame would not adjust on the mini.
3,"Nice design, but lights every 5th click","Paying this much for a lighter should permit a more reliable lighting. Obviously better quality than the popular BBQ lighters found everywhere, and makes for a nice mantle piece. Three stars for nice chrome accents and adjustment hardware."
1,Junk,"It would be nice if the thing would light everytime I slide the button, rather than having to do it over and over. It only lights about every 3-4 times I slide the button. And also, the warning label is practically super glued to the thing. I don't want some ugly label taking up an entire side of the thing."
4,4 stars since I haven't lit it yet,"I haven't tried it out yet, I still need to purchase some butane and then give it to my husband for christmas, but it is a beautiful lighter. I saw some in a store for nearly half the price, but I'm glad I ordered this one. It is much higher quality and even came in a metal gift box."
1,I expected much more from a Zippo.,"I expected more from Zippo. The design of this lighter is weak.I imagine most people throw them away in disgust rather than returning to the manufacturer. I also must question the source of any 5 star review.All the Butane Zippo products I have used suffer the same problems:*Tiny fuel tank for a giant-sized device.*Weak and ineffective electronic ignition.*Over-engineered child-proof mechanism that is adult-proof as well.I would return it to the manufacturer, but they would need to completelyre-design and manufacture an entirely new product to make me a happy customer and restore the damage that this lighter has done to the entire Zippo brand."
1,Confirmed junk,"From Zippo brand and the retail price one would expect some level of quality. Not so with the Zippo ""Multi-Purpose"" MPL Lighter, not so.I bought it for the cool looks and for known brand name. I've gone thru two of them in a short time (less than a year) with less than moderate usage (6 times per week).Pros: 1. Brand name, 2. Sexy looks, 3. Feels solid (although it isn't).Cons: 1. Extremely hard to operate - child-proof is more like anybody-proof, 2. Tiny-teeny gas tank; good only for a few light-ups, 3. Lack of gas tank gauge window - so you don't know if it broke already or just ran out of gas, 4. Very short lived product = junk.I keep looking for a good lighter, preferably one made in USA."
3,Excellent lighter... until it comes time to re-fill.,"Ours was purchased at Target, unfortunately Target doesn't carry the butane. You'd think butane would be an easy thing to find. Finally found a bottle of Pop-Lite butane 300ml (about 10 ounces) for $3 something at a liquor store. Unfortunately none of the nozzles work with this lighter (and Pop-Lite HAS worked with some of my previous torch-style lighters in the past). Now the Zippo brand butane is for sale on Amazon right now for $3... plus $8 shipping. Yeah right, for 1.9 ounces? Something smells proprietary around here.I bought a Bic and now the Zippo is a paperweight."
1,"Worked for 3 times, then died. Urgh",I really don't want to keep buying and throwing away cheap plastic lighters. So I was willing to spend more to buy something more substantial and long lasting.This worked 3xs and then died. By the time I attempted the fourth and fifth and sixth and so on....the return date had passed. (BTW its full of butane)Very very poor product.
2,Zippo MPL,"I've had one of these for many years until the tank sprung a leak. I ordered another from Chelsea Watch which didn't work. I sent it back and got a refund for the initial purchase price. The return shipping, however, was on me. They should have sent me another that worked but instead I'm out $6.65 and still have no lighter. I don't think I'll try my luck again!"
3,"OK, but you can probably do better...","I bought this exact same lighter from Shopko for lighting candles around my house.Here are the Facts:- It's sleek & attractive.- It has an adjustable flame.- It uses Butane.- It's Easy to refill.- It has a VERY annoying child safety feature.- The slider has a LOT of push back, and may be difficult to use for some.(especially with the child safety button)Overall, it does its job, and looks nice.. so I cant say it's garbage.However, the fact that you have to push on it like your trying to rub the paint off gets old very quickly."
2,Ok product..,"This product was not as amazing as I had expected. It doesn't tan you very well, and when you get out of the tanning bed, all you want to do is take a bath because you smell like burnt coffee.. YUCK! After you use it a while, you don't smell it as much, but EVERYONE ELSE does! My Mom tells me that it makes me smell like burnt plastic even after a bath. I have used $8.00 lotions that worked and smelled MUCH better! I Would not recommend it to my friends.."
2,Blaque Coffee,Product not as good as i thought it would be. Selle was excellent to deal with fast delivery
3,Not recommended for YFF newbies,"I must say i was a bit worried when i first got Electric Bird Digest. As a longtime YFF fan, this just smelled too much like a move to ride the ""grunge"" gravy train which had recently started running at the time this record came out. Thats not to say it doesnt have good songs on it, such as ""Thirsty"", ""Fear bitterness and hatred"" and ""The Telephone Tree"" (not to mention Tad Hutchison's goofy little interlude, ""The teen thing""), but as a YFF album, it is an entirely forgettable and superfluous item in YFF's otherwise impeccable oeuvre. The YFF /themselves/ didn't include /any/ tracks from Electric Bird Digest on thier Spanish 'Best of' CD, ""Somos Los Mejores"" (although they did use photography taken during the Electric Bird Digest sessions at Butch Vig's Smart Studios in Wisconsin.) Stay away from this CD, until you have fully digested the rest of the YFF catalog first!"
3,It was okay....,"It was okay although I liked Daaimah's story,My boo the best. It was a page turner for me.Tu-Shonda's story,Whatever It Takes was a good one.It had some funny parts in there.Crystal Winslow's story,Dangerously in Love, it started out slow but eventually it picked up.She through a curve with the ending because I wasn't expecting that.Brenda Thomas story, Every New Year,.... I finished it but I found it boring.It could have been better."
3,Overall an Interesting and Useful Volume,"Most of the essays in this volume reflect a critical theory approach. I found the essays in Part II to be the most useful. Overall there are a sufficient number of articles that I will use again that this book is worth purchasing, but I would not call it a ""must-have"" volume."
1,dissapointment with gun and service,MP5 Airsoft did not work when it was charged right out of the box and Airsplat customer service seems to hide behind an e-mail system with no live telephone support [I tried for several days during their stated Pacific time of operations and only got a message saying to e-mail concerns because they are closed]. Not impressed with a company that claims to be so large. They claim returns must be made within 3 days of receipt and the return authorization must be done online. There is no way we can get a return authorization number since we didn't order directly through the company but through Amazon.
2,up then went DOWN!!!,i got this gun and charged the battery. I tried shooting it and was AWSEOME! but the about a week later i wouldnt fire and made abuzzing sound when i pulled the trigger and sounded like a chainsaw. came in 2 weeks for me. (i live in germany) i hope that cymas ak74 is good because im getting it soon.
1,CRAP!,"I bought this gun from a store in Kansas City called Jungle Toys. The guns does NOT retail for $200. It retails for $60. The gun seemed nice in the store but when you go out and shoot it, it sucks. No distance and no velocity. Even better than that, the gun broke in under a week. Yes, broke. Right on the fire selector."
3,Deceptive,"I ordered this a couple of days ago and it just arrived. However, it is not exactly what I ordered. This gun is not made by Cyma. It is a Well R5. It does not include the retractable stock. At this price I am still okay with this gun, and as I already own several Well's I'm comfortable with that manufacturer. I really wanted the retractable stock though."
5,Hunting Trips of a Ranchman & The Wilderness Hunter,"The prose of TR takes me back to a time in America, a time before my own, but a time that I so wish I could have experienced in the saddle alongside TR. While the prose may be somewhat dated, as an avid reader and author I find it refreshing and relaxing. I use the present tense of the verb because I never seem to tire of reading and reading TR's sagas of life on the plains and the pursuit of big game. Today such pursuit is mostly for sport and I am but one of many who enjoy this great adventure, even to its fullest. Life on his ranch in the Badlands however required such pursuit for sustinence and as such required patience and persistance in far greater excess than many of us today possess. Many who choose to pursue elk, mule deer or antelope could do far worse than to read and absorb the lessons of one of the great plainsmen of history."
5,Hunter,Enjoyed reading this book. I'm an avid hunter anything to do with hunting I read. The autehr has lived the experiences
5,The greatest Hamlet,"Laurence Olivier's Hamlet is the one which, as I child, I watched and it instilled my love of the play and Shakespeare in general. It is the best of all the Hamlet movies because Olivier is simply the best. No one can speak 'To be or not to be' quite like him. A brilliant movie!"
5,Mel Gibson can't hold a candle to this,"In comparing this version to the one with Mel Gibson, I can only say that Olivier's version has a classicism that Gibson lacks. I also definitely prefer that more Elizabethan style of dress used by Olivier to the Medieval and Scandinavian costumes of Gibson. This film is a class of it's own, which I think is only accentuated by the ""black-and-white-ness."""
3,A Stunning Disappointment,"The great Sir Laurence Olivier, lauded by film critics as a the quintessential Shakespearian thesbian, fails to give any of his inspiration to Hamlet. ""This is the story of a man who could not make up his mind,"" the narration at the beginning of the film states. And so the rest of the film fulfills this prediction. The real anguish and pain inspired from Hamlet's father's untimely death do not manage to inspire any viewer sympathy with the troubled youth. Later versions of Hamlet, surprisingly, the Mel Gibson version, imbued Hamlet's character with much more passion and much more charisma."
5,The definitive film -- a Masterpiece!,"If the only thing Sir Lawrence Oliver did in his film career was to produce and star in this film -- that alone would guarantee his immortality. I am certain more people have learned Hamlet by viewing this film, than ever read a single line of the play. With all the recent success of Shakespeare on film the timing is right for a re-release. I still prefer this to the more recent efforts by Zepherelli and Branaugh."
3,I don't get it,"Olivier's Hamlet has worthwhile parts, but also some very awkward and stagey moments that make it hard to watch for the modern viewer.For example, he does some of the soliloquies as voice-overs, which means the *picture* can be just a close-up of him staring off into space or striking poses - for minutes! Also, he tends to build volume and fever over the course of certain speeches to end up YELLING at the end, and whenever possible climbing something and jumping off too, all with no apparent correlation to the words involved! Maybe this Hamlet's frustrated ambition is up there at the dreadful summit of the beetling cliff.Of the supporting cast, I think the Gertrude is strongest, although not very completely person-ized. Ophelia provides no equal match for the queen's sexual magnetism, Claudius is a fine bloated drunken tyrant, Polonius is very silly and doddery."
4,Another good Lawrence Olivier adaptation of Shakespeare,"This review is for the Criterion Collection DVD edition of the film.In this release Olivier's second adaptation of a Shakespeare play, Olivier again plays the title role. Unlike the previous film, this one is in black and white,It follows the story of a Danish prince bent on avenging the murder of his father by his uncle.I would assume that most people know the plot so that is all I will say about it,The DVD has no special features which is not normal for a Criterion release."
1,Where are Rosencrantz and Guildenstern!,"Unfortunately, Olivier is a bit long in the tooth for this part, and besides Jean Simmons' Ophelia it does not wear time well. But most of all, how can a production of Hamlet omit Rosencrantz and Guildenstern. They are not there, and neither are Hamlet's beautiful lines ""I have of late but wherefore I know not lost of all my mirth . . . what a piece of work is man . . ""These two ""friends"" of Hamlet brought a certain depth to him, his complaint about being played on like a flute, which helps to establish that whatever else Hamlet was, he was first of all a Prince, and next to the Crown. And his escape from death by his wits on his way to England . . without Rosencrantz and Guildenstern that just couldn't happen.Fie, fie, this version is a travesty and should be destroyed!"
1,misplaced?,"I don't understand - the title, details, notes and picture are for the Olivier's Hamlet, while selected any of these come as Felix Aylmer's Hamlet. I want to buy the Olivier's Hamlet, not the Felix Aylmer's and there is no way to select it. Can you, please, sort out this?"
2,Thank God for Mr. Luhrmann!,"This is the silliest thing I have ever seen. Once again the gorgeous Mr. Olivier follows the rule of If You Cant Do It Good Do It Loud. Look out whenever he has a speech more than two lines long! He will start out low and fast and get faster and louder and louder and louder until I think the other characters give in just so he will shut up. Olivier does this in every Shakespeare I have seen except As You Like It, which he must have made before someone told him the Secret of Playing Shakespeare above. Watching this movie is like visiting a tomb, and it proves the truth of the statement that the only good Shakespeare is contemporary Shakespeare. I am not even going to mention the costuming in the last scene, which anyone in mixed company or with children should be made keenly aware of before showing the entire preceeding play."
5,"Olivier's, "" a study in Hamlet.""","Many a film and stage production has been seen of Shakespeare'scompelling tragic drama. What this film was and is (interpretationby Laurence Olivier and Alan Dent watching human behaviour, in all its awful futility.)To quote, ""HAMLET is revealed as a bold meditation on morality!""Olivier's Hamlet reaches "" the undiscovered country from whose bournno traveller returns.""This is not a word for word copy of the play; but a great achieve-ment of maybe what was and is to be conveyed - the essence!Dag StombergSt. Andrews, Scotland"
3,"Some great, some not so great...","Strictly the Best is a long-lasting series of albums that have been out for years. This year's compilation has both slower & faster jams in one cd. This may or may not be good, depending on what you're expecting.All in all, I'd say this particular title has some great, and not so great tracks. Definitely listen to the samples before purchasing, if you don't already know the tracks."
4,"Just as We got to be White, We Didn't Want to Be","From the time that Gd spoke to Abraham, two questions have been bugging everyone, Who is a Jew? What is a Jew? The answer is that Jews are a religious and ethnic group (People) no different than Armenians or Greeks.Ok that's my opinion but everyone else has to have their say and their opinion. And I do mean everybody. In reality, we are who we are and who we say we are, and everyone else can pound sand. Somethings are self defining, like being a member of the counter-culture in the 60s.Professor Goldstein, being a professor, spends a lot of time telling us just about the same thing, but who's gonna read a one paragraph book. His thesis is well documented and thought out, but it's a little dry. (I guess he didn't get the jewish comedy gene.)Academically the book is a fine addition to the discussion of Jews as whites but doesn't address the culture versus religion question.Zeb Kantrowitz"
5,Wow ! What a great book.,Great read. This book shows deep thought about the role of Jews in America. The author gives new insight to sensitive issues important to all races and religions. It is a welcome addition in my library.
2,"No judgment here, just my personal experience","I won't pan it completely, just share my experience with others who may have the same. I took 20mg/day for two months. I noted absolutely no effect other than a slight wooziness for a few minutes after ingesting, which passed after the first 3 weeks. I tried it for age related short term memory loss. I wish that I had the positive experience reported by other reviewers. I really wanted it to work!"
3,Not sure about the nootropic effect.,"I started taking it for its supposed nootropic effect. I am not sure if it worked as I used it in combination with 3 other products. The only thing I noticed is a huge migraine and that was enough for me to stop taking it. Maybe, I will need to try it alone to notice any memory enhancement."
2,Gave it a good shot...didn't work for me,"I understand that this product might affect older folks differently from younger ones (I'm 30 years old), but I guess given I'm already in very good health perhaps it was doomed to not change how I feel. I tried this product for a full week at 20 mg per day and felt nothing whatsoever. Not even placebo effect! For $5, it's still worth a shot if you're sedentary and are looking to give your brain a boost."
2,Check first,"As with any supplement, it is better to check with a doctor first, I took this because there were some theories that it might help with tinnitus, but after using it for over a year I have noticed no difference. In fact I started developing a slight nagging headache that went away when I stopped.It definitely needs to be taken with food and you should know that this is a prescription drug in Europe. It is purported to be an aid for memory improvement and an anti inflammatory drug.Because of these properties you should also be aware that anyone with blood pressure problems or who is taking blood thinners should not take this.So for some this might work well - just did not for me"
5,Hey I like this!,"I use this to boost mySource Naturals Huperzine A, 200mcg, 120 Tablets. The Hupe on its own is a great replacement for the expensive Exelon patch which is prescription only and $250 for a month's supply. For me, at a 100mcg/day (half pill) I'm almost good as new, instead of 72 and brain dead.But when I add the Vinpocetine into the mix, I get boosts in ways I never did before. It seems (for me anyway) to compliment the Huperzine and make me sharper, gives me mental energy and makes me way more vocal, which is good because I'm a bit introverted. I talk a lot more now, and surprisingly it's not just babble. People listen and are much more friendly to me.Hey I like this!8/14/2012 Update:I find this combination also gives me a tenacity I haven't had before. I see things through to completion much better than I have in years.2/12/2013 Update:I've increased my dosage now to a whole tablet each morning of both Huperzine and Vinpocetine."
4,Memory pills work!,"We'd been taking another manufacturer's product by the same name for about 6 months.This product has been equally effective, and costs 1/3 the price.Thanks for providing us with a choice!"
1,Vinpocetine can cause depression,"From wikipedia on vinpocetine:Vinpocetine increases in neuronal levels of DOPAC, a metabolic breakdown product of dopamine, have been shown to occur in striatal isolated nerve endings as a result of exposure to vinpocetine.[15] Such an effect is consistent with the biogenic pharmacology of reserpine, a structural relative of vinpocetine, which depletes catecholamine levels and causes depression as a side effect of the cardiovascular and anti-psychotic effects.[15] However, this effect tends to be reversible upon cessation of Vinpocetine administration, with full remission typically occurring within 3-4 weeks.Basically, it can lower dopamine, serotonin and norepinepherine all of which are essential neurotransmitters involved in mood and cognition."
1,It can cause depression,"After taking this supplement for three weeks I've noticed that I am always sad and depressed. It didn't help with focus or memory. I'll stop taking this supplement and see if my depression improves.Source Naturals Vinpocetine 10mg, 120 Tablets (Pack of 2)"
4,Increases concentration but gave me insomnia.,"I tried taking 2 at mid day, felt more energy, concentration after about 1-2 hours, lasting for a few hours, not unpleasant, but not the kind you get from dopmaine (ritalin or adderall).Same day could not fall asleep. I tried it again the next day, with the same outcome.Stopped taking it and my sleep returned to its norm.Overall the benefits for me from Vinpocetine are mild to small, but the cost too high.I gave the rest to my mum, she says it doesn't bother with her sleep and that it had helped some with her memory, but she would not pay for it."
4,Can spike depression,"I would like to second the concern about this product's effects on depression. If you have a history of depression please consider staying away from vinpocetine. If you do decide to go ahead and get it, start with a low dose for a week or so and stop taking it if you notice increasing irritability and other symptoms. If you keep going it can get really bad really quick and take quite a few days to recover. That said, this is really vinpocetine and for many people it is beneficial. So, I'm giving it 4 stars anyway. Product fine, shipping quick. It isn't the seller's fault that different people have different biochemistry."
1,Vinpocetine and severe depression,"I began taking vinpocetine since my mother had vascular dementia. I took it for three weeks and in those 3 weeks I was hit with a severe and pervasive sense of sadness. I'm typically a joyful person but couldn't shake this depression and intense sense of sadness. I did additional research into vinpocetine and saw the link between depression and vinpocetine. I stopped taking the vinpocetine and now a week later, my sense of emotional well-being and joy has returned. Beware all of you that, like me take supplements to better their health and lifestyles. Do your research because supplements behave differently in different people. To your health!"
3,Ms. 45,A good watch. I ordered the VHS because I heard the dvd had cut out some key scenes. Well the VHS is the full un edited version. Not as much exploitation as I expected. The scenes they did show really didn't show any thing to over the top. Overall a decent movie with decent acting not a bad buy.
5,Avoid the Noid,Integral (i.e. uncut w/any and all deleted scenes restored) version of this film is available as a PAL import on Amazon or just go to the source on Amazon France. You'll need a multi-region player AND multi-region TV but the investment is worth it. You'll enjoy many foreign films with zero hassle and no censorship. Try it you'll like it.
2,Not The Best!,"This compilation is not the best way to introduce The Stranglers to a new audience or, for that matter, to persuade die-hard fans to part with their cash. Culled mainly from the previous three Stranglers studio albums ( 'About Time', 'Written In Red' and 'Coup De Grace' ), this album contains some of the better songs ( 'Valley Of The Birds', 'Money', 'Still Life') and some of the very worst ('The Light', 'And The Boat Sails by', 'In A while') to appear on the these three albums. Throw in a couple of live tracks heard a million times better on other CD's and you have a very half-baked album which, in my view, I can't understand was ever compiled in the first place. There are so many other albums like this around which do the band no justice whatsoever. I suggest you pass on this one!"
4,great film,excellent film. a great story. one of those films that didn't get a lot of attention but very entertaining.
2,"Sturdy, but too slim","Bought various covers for my outdoor furniture like this. Well made & sturdy, but I had to return this one. It was made so skinny my umbrella wouldn't fit, and the zipper wouldn't go up. The umbrella is an ordinary 7 foot one, not bulky at all. I can't imagine what kind of umbrella would fit in this cover.Customer service on return good."
3,Ridiculous Fun...,"Watch out! The eeevil ""address-book killer"" is loose! Oh no! He's been zapped by lightning while being given an MRI, resulting in his soul being sucked out and deposited into the internet! Now, he's able to track his victims down in no time, using household appliances to burn, drown, and electricute his prey! Terry Monroe (Karen Allen) finds herself on the disembodied killer's list, along w/ her family and friends. What can she do when even her toaster could be a murderous device of doom? It all sounds hokey, and it is. However, this movie is not lacking in entertainment value. The bubbling-faced, microwaved man and death-by-dishwasher scenes by themselves are worth the price of the DVD! So, pull out your brain, mail it to a faraway place, and experience the joy..."
2,A good idea,"gone bad. This film was not completely terrible but it is no horror classic, I don't even think it's much of a horror movie -- It isn't scary, or gory, or suspenseful. It had potentional but it just kind of fell flat on it's face.Karen Allen, (Raiders of the lost arc, Scrooged, and Animal House), plays the single mother who's computerized address book is being used by the ""soul"" of the serial killer. he kills off her friends that are in the book.I can see why this is a ""straight to video"" movie. The acting wasn't any worse than most horror movies, but the execution of the film is just poor. If you are a real horror film buff, watch Nightmare on elm street as opposed to this. The killer is actually scary! ..."
5,Magical nonsense,"I was dubious about this book. Could a book containing the librettos of all the Gilbert and Sullivan operettas have room for substantial annotations? The answr was that a very thick book can do it. The numbered lines of the libretto on the right page are keyed to plentiful annotations on the facing left. A very satisfactory ""Annotated G & S"" for G & S lovers."
3,This book has no index!,"I bought this book and then returned it because,astonishingly, it has no index.And only a perfunctory table of contents (as you can see above).Fine if you want to read it like a novel,but for a reference these are serious shortcomings."
3,Extensive,"The book gives a little history of G&S, a little history of each play and the words for all the songs(right page) with comments on the facing page. The comments include Victorian word meanings, changes in wording over time, allusions, and how the song related to politics of the day. The only problem the physical book is so thick it is hard to hold and read. Perhaps I will tear it apart and keep the 5 operettas I like. But, as a reference, it is all there."
4,Its all here.,"While admittedly the best annotated G&S libretti is the one documented by Martyn Green, this edition actually covers the complete series of fourteen operetti. Lots of good information."
3,"Why, damme, it's too bad!","$42.00?? C'mon now, this is a paperback for pity's sake! I would have no problems with the price if this book really had enough information contained to make it worthwhile. Basically it consists of the librettos of all the G & S (Thespis excluded. so how is it so darn complete?) operas on the right-hand page, with notes etc. on the left page. In all fairness the notes are on the exhaustive side, but without an index it become a chore to find anything revelant to which you may want to apply them. Coupled with some perfunctory introductions I can't in fairness give this more than 3 stars. Perhaps a bio of the respective librettist & composer would have come in handy, as well as a few illusrations showing productions of the operas over the years; would make me harp less about the price."
5,This book is a treasure,"I have read many many books, and I have to say that this is one of my absolute favorites. This is a book of the highest quality. Don't be fooled from the title, this is not a sappy how to love yourself book. This is a straight forward, intense account of the world around us as we know it. Yet in a way, that I believe only Gloria Steinem could tell it. She is at once brilliant, insightful, comforting, and angering. Her book made me see life through new eyes, better eyes. Steinem's book is also so obviously well researched, in fact startling facts and statistics reside on every page. If you want to feel passion and rightous anger in your soul, or if you want to read a book that will open your eyes, read this one. Books of this caliber really do not come around that often."
4,A real upper,"It's unfortunate that this book was read and reviewed as ""the scoop on Gloria Steinem's love life"" or ""just goes to show that feminists have psychological problems."" What she's really talking about is a process of inner liberation that transcends age, looks, and sex. The book has valuable insights for everyone, and deserves to be read with more attention to its contents than to its author's political beliefs."
5,The Original Girl Power,"After undercover work as a bunny in Hugh Hefner's Playboy Club, Gloria Steinmen's expose of world of wearing a rabbit outfit and 6 inch shoes with tight corsets made her the Queen of Feminists. This came out when I was a teenager and her vision and mission made an impression even then. A must have book for any feminist's collection."
5,Gloria Steinem,"Haven't had to much time to try and read yet, but I started it and found it incredibly moving so far. Gloria Steinem is a great writer and I'm looking forward to getting a chance to finish reading it. It came quickly and in great condition!!"
3,"Good price, bad welding","The price is excellent. The black powder coating is very good. The triangular piece on the stake, meant to stabalize the sign, came off with the first light tap when I was pushing it into the ground. I had even loosened the soil and created a hole with a wooden stake to make the job easier. The sign is small enough that for now it is stable even without that triangular piece."
5,LOOK REAL,Love how these lemon slices look so real. I have had alot of people ask me where I purchased something that looks so real.
3,Well made but I expected more...,"This production is very well made and does give us a behinds the scene look at the Sniper Comp. I was, however, left wanting more. I am, like many who will be interested in this documentary, a shooting nerd and was left wanting in regards to information relating to the equipment being used and the sniper's thoughts on their particular weapon system. Perhaps this is asking too much as I'm not sure how free the producers were with access to this kind of detail or the snipers to talk about such things. Never the less I happily watched it all and enjoyed every minute."
4,Good Reference for the Average User,"One of the challenges of using Project 98 is figuring out all the bells and whistles...and there are a TON of them. If you're a project manager and have a lot of detailed reporting to do, multilevel project information to status and many, many resources to take care of, you'll be using all of those features. However, most users of Project 98 don't need to know how to do *EVERYTHING* but would like to do more than show just a Gantt chart. This book will show you, in a clear, concise manner, how to do what you need to do, and how to use the most helpful features of Project 98. I attended a 3 day seminar on Project 98, and the course outline pretty much followed the chapters in this book! If you don't want to take the time or spend the money to attend a seminar, then buy and read this book: it'll get you up and running pretty quickly."
2,This book needs an extra chapter.,I think this book is ok if you are already familar with the task bar and menu. I use other microsoft office applications and understood some of the feautres that are similar. However the author assumes you know ALL the commands in the task bar and menu. I didn't know where some of the buttons and commands are that are unique to this applications. This book didn't cover the menu of project 98 clearly enough for those who have never used the application.
1,Not a very helpful book,"I recently purchased this book and was very disappointed with it. It was full of typos and other errors. The strategies were poorly explained and confusing. It talks all about how SAT questions get harder as the test progresses but its own practice tests do not reflect this. It says that it explains all the answers to the practice tests but most of the so-called explanations only tell why that answer is right instead of also telling why the other answers are wrong; many other explanations don't even do that much, they basically say 'this is the right answer because we say so'. I would not recomend this book to anyone."
4,Not all the student.,"All the student don't need this book.ARCO's Master SAT is kinda Difficult for the studedntwho just get into SAT I ....As you see I'm international Student in Korea.But I've already got 1450 SAT..I've really LOOKING FOR ""IT"" which upgrade my score..Other books is kinda EAST to improve my score..AFTER Studying this book,I've finally got the 1500.....For the foreign student,VERBAL is the name of the game..And what is really needed to be the winner...IS the real model test....."
4,HBC at her best,"This is a not so interesting movie completely redeemed by a wonderful performance by Helena Bonham Carter. She's beautiful, heartbreaking, funny and oh how she can speak french!!!"
5,HISTORY UNCOVERED,"THIS VIDEO PROVED TO BE A REVELATION OF HISTORY FOR ME. I HAD HEARD ABOUT NAZI CASTLES BUT I NEVER REALIZED THAT THEY ACTUALLY EXISTED. AN ABSOLUTELY WONDER VIDEO, WITH HIGH QUALITY OUTSTANDING ARCHIVAL FILM AND COLOR FOOTAGE. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"
5,One of a kind,"Great product! This is the first video I've seen on this subject and I found it absolutely fascinating. The architecture of the monumental structures is not only intriguing but exceptionally unique. The crystal clear archival film along with the outstanding current footage is excellent. Very enjoyable, highly recommended and worth every penny."
3,Very informative... but poor quality for the price,"I found that video very informative and unique but the sound and picture quality is poor. The stereo track is on and off continuously and there is problems with the tracking of the picture. So, a very good documentary but if i knew, i would have tried to find a used one. The price is much expensive for the quality."
5,a classic,"This is a wonderful book for children or for any age. Subtle and beautifully written, and perfect artwork."
3,Very Disappointing!,"Highlander, which is one of my favorite collections, was tainted with the last season. Out of the 13 episodes, Adrain Paul makes himself scarce, if in the episode at all. The only three worth the price was the series finale (last two episodes) and seeing Methos once again. Otherwise, save yourself the money and just get the series finale ""To Be"" and ""Not To Be"". The last three discs are all extras with a great many things that were already seen on the previous 5 seasons."
2,Great Series - 5th Season was was worst,"A poor ending to a great series. One word to describe ""Disappointing""."
1,Disappointing,"I've enjoyed the Highlander series and was looking forward to a great finish for a great series....however, I was greatly disappointed. With the exception of the two-part finale, all the other episodes were lacking. Duncan McLeod isn't even in most of them--instead the episodes are just bad attempts at spin-offs. The only upside to sitting through them is Duncan being the love interest of the female stars. Quite disappointing for the amount of money. Not the same caliber as the other series sets."
2,Too little for too much,"If this set had cost $29.99 and contained only three or four discs, I wouldn't feel nearly as cheated. The commentaries introducing the episodes were repetitive and mainly lamented the scarcity of Adrian Paul. Since the introductory commentaries had been one of the best parts of the previous five seasons' DVDs, this is a major drawback.The episodes auditioning a format for RAVEN weren't that bad in and of themselves, but they weren't HIGHLANDER. The finale was good and pulled together the best threads of the previous seasons (I would have liked Xavier St Cloud included, but still...)I was also disappointed that, though Elizabeth and Peter were featured in the opening credits of the sixth season, there weren't Methos and/or Amanda centered episodes, except for the Joe & Methos one.There were 4 discs that contained NOTHING that couldn't have been added to the first 4. Only for people who really have to have the completes series."
4,Review of Highlander DVD,The gift was received very well. It complimented the other 5 Seasons. I would recommend this product to other people.
3,While Enjoyed The Series Overall The Season 5 finale And The Entire Season Six Really Let Me Down,"While this was a show you obviously had to take with a great deal of salt the cast and stories for most of the shoe more then made up for that. Sadly though after the ridiculous season 5 finale story arc it just felt that the writers and producers were just looking to end the final season on the highest note as possible because of that terrible story arc. Season six isn't horrible but the episodes just felt greatly diluted in entertainment from what we saw from the last five previous seasons of the show, also it just felt that the main actor Adrian Paul was more interested in just finishing up the last season then bringing back the feeling of excitement to the series. If you're a completest then I'd say now's the time to add the final season set to your dvd library just don't expect this season to match up to the last five seasons though...."
3,Highlander The Series - Season 6,Looked new but I couldn't get all the cd's to play. So I could not watch them all and we have three dvd players.
3,Highlander Fan,The Series Finale was one of the only bright points in season 6. If you're a true fan of the show then purchase season 6 to complete your collection.
4,Highlander 6 TV series,I liked the TV series so I collected the seasons. It is a good fantasy show for those that do not want to read too much into it and just enjoy the possibility.
1,Poor Quality ruins a great show,"I gave away the VHS version of this show in favor of DVD's and now wish I hadn't. I have ordered season six three times now and every one of them has been defective. One disc won't load, and two or more episodes freeze in mid play and cannot be restarted. Of the more than 1200 CD's and 300 DVD's that I own, these are the only ones that have been a problem. The first seller told me that they had multiple returns of the series for defects and it seems that rather than fix the problem, the manufacturer has decided to discontinue selling the sets. That's really too bad."
3,Highlander Season 6,"I love the Highlander TV series. Unfortunately, Adrian Paul was checking out in this last season and it is not as good as the first 5."
3,"Nice, but some shortcomings.","""Anchor Bay"" should be commended for releasing so many good old favorites, like several ""Hammer"" classics. This documentary though, is in all honesty not that good. As an introduction to new fans I'm sure it's ideal, but older fans have heard the stories a million times before. -That is, if you can hear anything. Most of the time the music is mixed too loud, making it almost impossible to catch Cushing- and Lee's narration. -This ofcourse is a big minus; it was after all Cushing's last piece of work. There are some nice interviews though, but as always too short. I recommend it anyway."
1,worse than ever,"I can't believe anyone found this movie entertaining. I would give it 1/2 stars if there was an option for that. It is just a waste of time watching this, and I am a big Uma fan, I am I thinking why did she bother to act in this, if you could even call it that. And the Whit character, and his special feature documentary, who compiled that waste of film as well. I can't see ANYTHING worthwhile from this film and thank goodness the public wasn't subject to it on the big screen long, I rented it, and I think it was a waste of a 1.00. I see no genius or purpose to it whatsoever."
2,Not enough,"If that's the best preview you have to offer you may not get anyone to rent this movie, especially for $9.99"
2,nothing special and went nowhere,"Well I have to say I was disappointed with this movie, good actors, tick. However it failed to engage me and if there had been something better on tv, I would have switched it over to that, enough said."
2,"Not funny, not sexy so what's the point?","This indi-film opened recently with a thud, and is now available on disc. I'm not sure what has happened to Uma Thurman's career but this adds to a list of her clunkers. The set up isn't a creative one. Twenty three year old geeky children's book author Sam Davis (Michael Angarano) isn't having much success and he's recently dumped by the statuesque Zoe (Thurman). Now right there we have a problem. Sam is about 5 foot nothing and Zoe is about a foot taller, not to mention well on her way to 40. Don't get me wrong, the problem isn't there physical differences, it's that there is no chemistry or attraction for the audience. Sam and his best friend Marshall (Reece Daniel Thompson) decide to get away to rekindle their bromance (strictly hetero). They run into Zoe who is about to get married on the beach. Foolishness ensues. The film's not sexy or funny so what's the point?"
1,Not terrible,"But not good, either. I was expecting a romantic COMEDY as the description stated, but there is nothing funny about this movie. I guess the story line isn't too terrible, but really it's rather sad. I would give it 0 stars, except that it's unpredictable, which is good in a romantic type movie. Other than that, I have nothing good to say about it."
4,Not catching the rye,"This movie is a bit of a twist on the classic themes of Catcher in the Rye. In Ceremony, a younger man falls for an older woman who's engaged to be married soon. While it might sound like a typical romantic comedy plot, in fact the characters in this film feel much more real. There are no heroes or villains but just a group of people struggling with their emotions. Ceremony isn't a hilarious movie, but it does have its moments of genuine comedy. Michael Angarano does a particularly good job of making is character a mix between a used car salesman and lovestruck boy. Best of all, the movie isn't predictable. Things aren't always what they seem. Overall, not bad for a romantic comedy."
1,"I kept thinking it was going to get better, it didn't","I watched this movie from beginning to end and I kept hoping it was going to get better and now I feel like I wasted 2 hours of my life. I love to watch independent films, but this was excruciating. I don't understand the good reviews. The trailer made it look MUCH better than it was. Sad waste of talent."
5,I want to marry this movie.,"I loved Ceremony and was shocked it didn't get a wider release in theaters. Angarano is brilliant and Jake Johnson gives one of my favorite performances in a long time. If you're looking for a very unique, fresh new movie filled with young talent check this out."
2,Doesn't Work,"This is a movie about a cougar romance that comes into conflict on the eve of the cougar's wedding. Sounds like the perfect set up for a romantic comedy, eh? Unfortunately, this is neither romantic nor funny.First, the couple has NO chemistry. Uma is too mature (I mean that in mannerisms, not looks) to ever have fallen into a frivolous relationship with this guy. They go through the motions, but he looks like a complete boy. She looks like she's in a totally different class and stage of life. The two have nowhere to meet- not even in lust. So, that doesn't work.I could go on with example after example to illustrate what went wrong, but then I'd spend more time on the review than it took to watch it. Bottom line is that the story tries to be clever, real, and emotionally moving, but you can see the writer's wheels turning in his head. If you can see the story, you don't feel it."
5,Great historical account,A tremendous amount of research went into this book and it shows. Very well done.
4,Unsure.,"What should you know about the book before buying?It has interesting stories. It's intriguing. It's exciting. It contains alot of history. It's unique.But... the whole time you're forced to think ""Really....?"" while reading it. The stories are pretty shocking and they're always ""almost"" believable. He's mostly very specific but then inside a story he can become very general very quickly. I suspect disinformation or bogus story telling in these moments.I do like the book. Sometimes I feel he's both ruthless.. and whiny at the same time.4 Stars because I never entirely bought it and I always had a sense that he was ratting out people he had grudges on(the gay scandal was entirely bogus I'm sure. So strange!)"
3,Disappointed,"Although I found a lot of the story interesting it seemed obvious that the Author did not think highly of the ""Institute"" itself, nor of his former bosses and comrades. The Author often sounds bitter about his experiences and almost as if he is questioning the reasons for them. I would have to ask him, ""if you were unwilling to serve, why did you do so?"" Even the title has a negative connotation.Still, the exploits of the Mossad and its ""katsas"" (according to the Author, the word for Mossad operatives)would be a good read in any case, but I would suggest that an interested reader might read the same events recounted by others for a different view. History is always best understood from a variety of sources."
2,Very disappointing,"This book seemed interesting initially, because it seemed to reveal information about the working of Mosad. Looking closer at its content, it should be pretty clear that this is just a bunch on non-sense. If Mosad was so deadly and efficient, why they did not simply kill him when he ran to Canada? This would be a decent fiction book, if not for the fact that it was really badly written."
4,No pulled punches.,The author provides a very instructive narrative about the training and practices of one of the most secretive and effective intelligence agencies in the world. Several incidents are described in a way that differs dramatically from the official narrative of events. What's most impressive is that the book draws an accurate picture of the breadth and reach of the Mossad. It is certainly very impressive and a great read as well.
3,Excellent book; horrendous printing,"This book is an excellent account of the secretive Mossad intelligence service in Isreal. However, I must say that this printing, by St. Martin's Press to be the WORST I've ever seen. The font choice is painful on the eyes, in that both the book and it's cover have clearly been printed using a run of the mill ink jet printer. I can literally count the dots contained in each letter. This leaves a strong ""fuzzy"" feeling while reading which is extremely distracting. The plastic film covering the outside of the book has already begun peeling off, despite having owned the book for less than a week.It was hard to choose an appropriate rating for this review. The book's contents (my hat off to Victor Ostrovsky) well deserves 5 stars, yet this paperback printing is well below professional quality, thus the lower overall score.Do yourself a favour and get a copy of the hardcover edition."
5,"If this book is false, why was it banned in U.S. & Canada?","If, as some people allege, this book contains so much false information and should therefore be disregarded, why did the Israelis work so hard to prevent its publishing, an endeavor at which they succeeded in the U.S., albeit only for one day. Also, how is it that a former New York Times #1 bestseller has gone out of print and virtually disappeared? The actions of the Israelis following the release of this book prove the truth of Mr. Ostrovsky's claims. Still in doubt about the whether the Israelis maintain an active spy network in the U.S.? 2 Words for you: Jonathan Pollard."
3,Uncertain credibility,"The book discusses things that almost anyone could glean from a careful search of international newspapers and other open sources. Although it makes for interesting reading, and it is particularly fasinating how the author finds subtle ways to stroke the American public, I remain unconvinced that this is a credible book. He seems to also have some juvenile personality conflicts with his co-workers and superiors. If it is even 10% credible, however, there are some serious implications for Mid-East peace."
3,Some good spy stories amidst a lot of complaining,"If this was a collection of short stories it would be great. The disgruntled angle detracts from the stories, and is unsatisfying on its own merits.First, the good. I won't spoil the stories by repeating them. I'll just say that they are satisfying, and intriguing. Some of the stories have been duplicated -- e.g. in Spy Games -- but the author goes through them in much greater detail here.Now, the bad. The complaints sound more like whining, and the allegations sound conspiratorial. That Israel has banned this book makes it sexier, but on its merits, it is difficult to believe the parochialism, narrow-mindedness, and short-sightedness that the author extrapolates from a few select (questionable) incidents. E.g. the Israelis keeping their mouths shut about the Beirut bombings. I'm only surprised there wasn't more discussing of the Liberty Incident.As long as you don't expect the wrong things, this book is a good read."
1,A book full of lies by a self hating Jew,"This book is a delight for all the anti-Semites in the world. The author, who no doubt was a failed officer in Israel, has come up with fantastic lies about the Mossad. In his drug induced hate filled mind, the author wants us to believe that the Mossad is responsible for all the evil in the world. He is in good company with other miserable self hating Jews who blame Israel for everything. Its a pile of garbage."
1,Hopeless Kindle edition,This book is scanned and OCRed badly. So many typos and really bad typography. One wonders why quality is of no concern when publishing electronic versions. I suggest you buy something else.
3,"Book good, but scanned content horrible.","Compared to other books I have read in the former spy genre, this book was OK. The book was interesting in that it provided more detail to world events that I lived through.The most disappointing aspect of this book was the content. I ordered the Kindle version and apparently the original book was scanned in. The scanning process was horrible since there were numerous times that I could not make sense of sentences or words because the wrong words were present. Without this major distraction, I probably would have enjoyed the book more."
3,Difficult to follow,"Interesting subject but, at times, following the story was as difficult as trying to determine if one is being followed while walking in Tel Aviv."
4,A look behind the scenes,"""Civilians"" rarely get a glimpse of what goes on behind the closed doors of the training centers of special forces and spies and what-nots. This book offers one view into that hidden world. Of course it was written a long time ago and many things have surely changed, but it's still amazing to read about the training program Mossad had already then. Not for the faint-of-heart.Interesting read if you've ever wondered about how things really happen in the world, and not just the movies."
4,Spy vs Spy at it's best,Love the spy vs spy stuff! A little disheartened by the author since it seems he is giving away so much about Mossad operations. Is he a little bitter after being let go?? Very interesting to know how widespread they are in the global arena. There were definitely chapters where I just couldn't put it down.
1,its written out of pure fantasy,"I say very simple: this book is pure fantasy.Just read the 2 pages about the ""secret swimming pool"" (which for some reason is deleted from the audio version) and tell me if its anything more then ostrovsky's wild dreams?"
1,One sided view.,"As expected, anything coming from Victor Ostrovsky will be negative and against Israel. The book is filled with real events, which the author dramatically changed and turned Israel responsible for them. No wonder this book is banned in Israel. In fact, because of the ban, many people believe that this book has true accounts of Mossad activities. True, the book gets interesting, but the author's motive to run down the Israel for everything happening around the world spoils it. This book is a perfect example of blaming a country and its intelligence agency for your own mistakes. I absolutely agree with J. A Magill's review, this book has no credible source of information, except the fact that Ostrovsky once worked for Mossad.Vindictiveness is the word behind this book. Absolutely one sided, and nothing to prove what author says. All I can say is that I want my money and most importantly my time back. I doubt if I can have either."
3,"Nice, heavy covers","These are nice, heavy furniture covers, and, although we haven't had them for too long, they will definitely hold up nicely. Our last set of lounge covers had these odd holes at the foot/base of the lounge that ended up leaving weather marks on the fabric, but fortunately these do not have those. Great purchase!UPDATE ON MAY 1, 2011: We've had these now for not quite two years, and they just haven't lasted that long. They've gotten really torn, and we're about to toss them in the trash. For the price, I guess they're OK, but they started tearing after about a year and have since gotten really bad. I originally gave them five stars, but have since downgraded my review to three stars."
2,Pin hole leaks,"The chaise cover looks and fits great. However, we did not put any cushions on the chaise until now, early March. The cover was bought last Fall, 2008, but only used to cover the metal frame over the winter. I now find the cover has pin hole leaks and the cushion is getting soaked. Time to find out if there is any warranty!"
5,serves its purpose,"I ordered two of these to keep my padded patio chaises from being water logged all the time. California weather cooperated by giving us a July rain for two days, which tested the new covers. They did the job very well."
3,Good looking but not very durable,"We purchased these covers in June '10, and by Christmastime they were falling apart. California just had a week straight of rain, and I picked up the cover to see how the cushions fared in the weather and the cover simply ripped and tore apart where I touched it.... not just the seams. So plan on replacing this at least once per year."
2,Ripped and trashed,"This looked so attractive, and with no kids or pets around anymore, thought I'd be o.k. . . buyer, beware! It rips - a lot. Which renders it useless as far as protecting and keeping clean what's underneath. Will buy cheaper, more disposable, and probably not as good looking covers from now on."
2,not very durable,I bought 2 of these about 6 months ago. They are now both shredded masses in the garbage. They did look nice and fit well the first few months. The fabric is moderately thick but rips very easily once a small tear is started. If you live somewhere with not much weather and dont have pets or small children these covers will probably be good enough but dont expect them to hold up to much stress.
1,Seems sturdy but tears easily,"I was originally delighted with what appeared to be sturdy construction.After a few months, tears started to appear in the fabric. I hadn't removedthe covers very much so they must be very sensitive to the environment in some way.It was a waste of money."
4,Great Covers for Lounges,"The material appears to be very sturdy. could use straps to put under legs but so far, even in very windy conditions, they are staying on."
4,seems to do the trick,so far so good. no signs of wear or depreciation. Has had some hot sun and some heavy rain.
4,chaise lounge covers,"I believe these covers are a good value. Bought two @ $24.95 each & got free shipping. Delivery was a lot faster than I was quoted. We'll see how they hold up over the winter rains and summer sun, but I'm confident that performance will be more than adequate. Generously sized, they have looks that just kind of blend in to the scene and for me that's a good thing. You could certainly pay a lot more and receive a lot less. I will buy additional covers like this if I have the need in the future - from AMAZON dot com - my favorite on-line store!"
2,keep looking,"it fits nicly to the 30 gig video ipod but keep looking for a better sleeve. the cables are walmart quality, better to spend money on better stuff.a nice inexpensive starter kit til you can afford something better."
1,Sad end to the Receiver,After 2.5 years of light use the main component gave up the ghost - six months after the warranty expired. I would stay away from this one and probably Denon products.
5,Maya 4 Fundamentals,"This is truly the best Maya book for beginners to advanced Maya users. The AVIs put this book far above the other Maya books.You can watch video clips of the authors doing the tutorials right on your computer. And, you can toggle between the Maya interface and tutorial to work along with the author.Authors, EXCELLENT job! Keep up the good work."
3,OK for beginners,"Maya Fundamentals is just that...the basic fundamentals.The cover is a little misleading, showing a very technical piece and the book goes nowhere near the detail shown. The tutorials are very basic and the color examples very limited(3 of 8 pages show the book's projects). I didn't open the cd because I decided to return the book but just from what I saw in the book, I really find it hard to be too impressed.Overall, if you're a beginner and want to get a feel for the basics without too much technical details, this is a decent book. If you're an experience user with some of the earlier Maya book, save your money."
4,"perfect piano but cold, not as warm as serkin not as fun as gulda",very good performance with clear soundbut not warmi like this album very much
5,amazing buy!,"I could not believe the quality of this bracelet for the price. It has four nice size garnets, linked with delicate but strong Celtic knot work. It's not too small either. I hate bracelets that are hard to fastening because there is play in them. The quality is such you would expect to pay twice there easily for this wonderful bracelet. I have already given on away as a thank you present."
5,GREAT GUIDE,"JUST GETTING INTO PRESSURE CANNING AND THIS BOOK HELPS A LOT; TIMES, HOW TO PREPARE EACH ITEM FOR CANNING AND HOW TO PRESERVE EVERYTHING THE PROPER WAY SO THAT YOU DON'T KILL YOURSELF VIA BADLY PROCESSED FOOD."
3,the art of canning,I've been watching all their videos this week and they are a good over view of a skill you might be interested in learning. The family is charming and they are enjoyable to watch. Still I'm glad I borrowed and didn't purchase them. I do not feel they are worth the amount they are charging. If they were cheaper then I would say worth it but for me I would rather buy a book and supplement with youtube videos if I need a visual. You can usually find something on youtube for just about any topic.
5,Powerful debut novel more than just a mystery,"A wonderful read. A wonderful experience. Protagonist Olivia Dale's own hypnotic pursuit of self is enough of a therapy session for the common reader. By combining the essentials of prize-winning literary fiction and a cool, hip beach read, Leah Stewart, in this exceptional debut novel, stuns the reader into discovering things about himself while being completely engrossed and entertained in her own seedy Memphis crime story. This is a psychological thriller that delivers! Buy today, start it today, don't put it down until it lets you. Stewart may just be the queen of a new generation of young writers poised to take the lierary world by storm."
3,Mystery rules,"This was a fairly good novel about an amateur sleuth who is helping solve a crime because she's a crime beat reporter and that's her job. What bothered me was that, as I read the book, I kept changing my opinion about who might have done from Carl to Peter et.al. as she introduced characters and then, in the last few pages, here come the real suspects apprehended already. I felt a bit cheated and as if I'd wasted my time trying to figure out the mystery. But - hey, Leah - not to worry - even Patricia Cornwell cheats in that same way occasionally. I'm sure you'll do well with subsequent efforts...."
4,Cooking Under Pressure,"Good Book, simple, but a number of very similar recipes for my taste. However, it does allow you to learn how to use the pressure cooker and make some good stuff right out of the gate. I'd recommend for a novice cook or a new pressure cooker user."
5,Quick & Healthy Eating,"When I retired I thought life would take on a more leisurely pace. Wrong! Spending my days doing the stuff I want to do often would make me look at the clock and wonder ""What am I having for supper? !"" I'm not the commercial fast food kind of person. Luckily, on impulse I bought a pressure cooker because it seemed easy enough to use. And just as luckily I discovered Lorna's books with easy directions and excellent recipes so I'm eating better than ever with healthy homemade fast food like tonight's Split Pea Soup with Sweet Potatoes and Mint from this book."
3,Not thrilled. A little disappointed.,I got this to help me get started with my new pressure cooker/canner. The recipes are too elitist in nature and probably not something that I would ever cook. Some of the info is useful though so will keep it for reference but really doubt it will be something I refer to too often.Wish I hadn't bought it.
3,Good Recipes,"Many good recipes and easy to follow directions. Any good cook will enjoy this cook book, many quick and easy recipes."
4,Miss Having Good Pictures,This pressure cooker cookbook has lots of very good recipes. I would have appreciated pictures to go along with the recipes.
4,Cooking Under Pressure,"An oldie, but goody. With pressure cooking coming back in vogue, this is a wonderful go to book for anyone, novice or exprienced at pressure cooking.I keep it within easy reach and use it two or three times a week."
3,So-so cookbook,"So many of these recipes are very similar. Same vegetables, etc. in a lot of the recipes - just a different meat. The recipes I have tried have definitely been tasty, I just wish there was more variety."
3,It's was okay but.....,"This is a good book for the instruction it provides on pressure cooker use - particularly electric cookers. Some of the recipes were a bit on the exotic side ( Moroccan Lamb Tagine? Boeuf en Daube Provencal? Blanquette de Veau?) - probably tasty but a bit too adventuresome for me. I needed a good cookbook with every day recipes that I could do in the pressure cooker. Overall, I think I chose poorly on this one. There are some recipes that sounded tasty - maybe after I've become buddies with my pressure cooker, I might give them a shot."
3,It's a cookbook,"Not much more to say than it's a cookbook. Nothing super good about it to me. Has recipes for items I will never make and unfortunately not enough recipes for what I *do* make.Now I just search the internet for pc recipes. Got a binder, print them out and am making my own cookbook!"
2,not specific for electric pressure cooker,The times for electric pressure cooker are different so the recipies have to be tried and tested on your own
3,"Very complicated recipes, but I'm sure there good.",As a college student I'm very pressed for time and money. Therefore I haven't been able to even test out any of the recipes in this book. Although I'm sure they're good some of the recipes require some very obscure ingredients. To its credit it does include some useful cook time charts in the back and is very informational in every respect.
3,"Wacky game, a bit of a risk","Don't Be a Dork prides itself on being a weird game. It is silly, and it requires participants to do downright silly things. Some of its off-the-wall rules and instructions are so shocking, they'll be very entertaining for many people. There are several problems that result. First, the rules are weak, making the game ripe for abuse by players. Especially when the game asks you to pick another player's nose hairs, enforcing the instructions can be problematic and tension-filled if players are competitive. Second, the ""Another Dimension"" area also lasts too long in many-playered games. It essentially killed our first game. All in all, the game takes too long (the novelty of its novelty wears off after 2 hours) and lacks well defined rules."
1,"Definitely not ""family fun""!","Unless you consider crude and tasteless humor your kind of ""family fun"", you will be sadly disappointed with this game. With a big bare butt, sperm and phrases like ""laying pipe"" printed right on the board, this is not even close to a family game let alone entertaining. (...). This one went back! There are so many great choices out there--this is NOT one of them."
2,Disappointed,"My friends and I are big time gamers. We love Cranium, Time's Up, Malarky and Connectomy. We had big expectations for this game, since it's always out of stock, but were sadly disappointed. The rules aren't clearly written and the cards aren't that funny. The best part about this game is Impersonation Alley. The rest of the game was dumb and annoying, which I suppose, is what a dork is. I'm mailing my game back for someone else to buy."
1,Don't waste your time or your money!!!,"I'm not sure where the other reviews came from, especially the ones that say how great it is. It's a terrible game! I played this game with my kids and maybe they weren't the right people to play it with. I wouldn't waste my money on it if I were you. Once you get the game you'll wonder why anyone would ever pay 30.00 for it. Well we did, so it's now one of those games that will sit beneath our beds collecting dust. I wish I had gotten something else. The directions were terrible and you ended up making your own. Questions were idiotic and consisted of things like: ""Why is there only a ""Captain America"", why not a ""Captain Long Hair Japanese Guy""? But.... don't take my word for it. Buy it if you have money to burn...by the way the answer to that question was ..""What a dumb question!!!"""
5,A Laugh Riot!,"Our family was looking for a new game this year and boy did we find a good one in ""Dork""! We played it Christmas night and went to bed with guts and faces aching from laughing so hard! Just reading the questions was enough to make us dissolve into gales of laughter! You definitely get out of this game what you put into it. If you buy into the premise, that you have to make an idiot out of yourself, you will have a ball. Great for all ages, the true trivia questions are no more difficult than some of the absurd ""Dork"" questions. If you are looking for something different, engaging and funny, look no further!"
2,Not as much fun as I thought,"This game is more goofy than anything else. My friends are not uptight but after being shown the board and given a description of the game, they were skeptical at best. We've attempted to play twice now and have never finished a whole game. Maybe this would have been fun when I was drunk in college but it's a little too silly for me now."
2,My thoughts,I really didn't like this book. There are many other books on SI that are more reader friendly.
2,Very Expensive,"Maybe there's a difference in quality, but two other sources have these for $3.25. And shipping can make a difference. Google ""plastic cover slips"" and see what you get."
3,"Glass, not plastic","The ones I received did come in a cool box, like the photo, however they were glass, not plastic. I really wanted plastic for safety reasons (I have fat fingers and also curious cats). Of course the first thing I did was accidentally drop one, which fortunately did not shatter, but it has put me off of buying any more of these."
4,Quality slides - hard to handle.,"On the plus side, it is nice to have lots of clean quality slides in a convenient box holder. when you need them. The box keeps dirt and dust always and makes it easier to find a clean slide when you need one. The only, negative is that is is sometimes a pain to get a slide out without taking the rest with you. Seems like a slide sticks whenever I need to get one out of the box when I have rubber gloves on."
1,Transaction Satisfaction,"Received timely but product was not as advertised. About half of the glass, not plastic as advertised, cover slips were broken. Seller refunded half of purchase price."
4,Guts For Sale,"This is the latest Meantraitors album, recorded in Russia in 1998.This album is far different from previous albums, even it is with bass guitar. Stas changed his vocals here, and there are more lyrics then music in some songs... All music is build on guitar, and this is boring sometimes.Anyway, this is a superb work and product is called Psychobilly."
4,Gimme More Beefheart !,"Wow, I hadn't seriously listened to The Captain in years until I bought this CD re-issue a couple of weeks back. I can't get enough of this one, and want to complete the collection. If you are a Tom Waits fan, you really need to get into Beefheart, it's the roots man. I love the garage fuzztone of ""Zig Zag Wanderer""; and ""Electricity"" is insane, mindblowing. If you like early Mothers Of Invention, you'll see an occassional similarity musically on this record. The only other Beefheart CD I own is Trout Mask Replica, and I like it but believe like many others that it's overrated. Anyhow, listening to this inpires me to get the rest of his catalog when finances permit."
2,what????,this is not the best beefheart you can buy. get the later stuff or live albums there better
4,The ultimate in 60's garage punk,"Those people who discovered the Captain on Trout Mask Replica will be surprised as I was to hear Captain Beefheart and His Magic Band before they wrote songs with titles like Neon Meate Dream of an Octafish. Which is not to say this album isn't weird, as the linear notes say, the 60's doo-wop of I'm Glad may be the weirdest thing the Captain has ever done. Safe as Milk reminded me a little of The Mothers of Invention's Freak Out, it's Top 40 60's doo-wop as interpreted by freaks. And if you were one of those people a bit put off by Trout Mask Replica's ""mucus mules"" and ""dough eating squid"", then this album may be a little more approachable. Mirthful ditties like Yellow Brick Road (which for some reason always reminds me of HR Puffinstuff) and Zig Zag Wanderer are so easy to fall in love with. And changing the subject somewhat, when are they going to release Lick My Decals Off on CD. I'm dying here."
5,"Safer than Milk, smells a little like Gym socks","Remasterd CD! Yeah I've got it! Captain B is simply the greatest white blues rock singer song writer of all time. I used to fry my brain to the Magic Band by sticking my head between the loudspeekers...To the likes of EEEELEECCTTRRRRIICCCCCITTTTTTTYYYY! At 13 years, it certainly sent me down a demented path forever. I have the LP's...They're the best way to go! Analog with a snap, Crackle and a Pop! B-Flatulant & bulbous...Sounds like heaven I say! Gimmee dat HARP BOY! Caution: Venture down this Yellow Brick Road full of parmusical madness, and you may lose your soul forever! Oh.. Don VanVliet, where goist thow now? Probaly living and painting for crow in a trailer somewhere near Lancaster?"
5,Un délice pour les petits enfants comme pour les grands,"Utilisé dans certaines maternelles comme livre de thème, ce livre ne peut que ravir les enfants qui aiment les animaux.Illustrateur : Frédéric Stehr a su donner à Calinours une attitude bonhomme, douce et cline qui va bien avec son nom. Les dessins sont agréables et illustrent bien le texte. La perspective et le mouvement aident à ressentir l'action dans chaque scène. Ceci étant un plus pour les enseignants ou parents qui aiment discuter les images avec les enfants.Auteur: Alain Broutin sait raconter des histoires qui ont du rythme, des rimes et un humour gentil. On a parfois envie de les chanter au lieu de les lire. Les enfants en raffolent.Histoire: Dans ce livre, notre ours préféré se réveille un petit matin enneigé plein d'énergie et part annoncer l'arrivée du printemps à tous ses amis, mais seront-ils tous du mme avis?"
3,Such A Crime,This movie does not have the greatest acting or story line but what soft porn movies do? The sex scenes were not too bad. At least it is a movie made by women for women to enjoy. Wolfe Video has given gays/lesbians a decent alternative to the typical stuff we find at the adult movie shops.
4,king of the royal mounted,nice clear sharp transfer from good film source i have been collecting serials for 35 years vhs and dvd this in my opinion is one of the best serials made it has good contrast brightness i would have rated 5 stars but my copy lost audio for 5 seconds at end of red ryder trailer has any one else had this happen every else just fine hats off to vci entertainment pleasure to watch
3,worthwhile read,"Although not as thorough as I had hoped, What Hollywood Believes is an interesting look at what some of the most popular actresses/actors of our day have to say about their religious beliefs. My main complaint about this book is that most of the sections are not very elaborate and only deal with one or two quotes from a particular person. This can hardly be evidence of that person's genuine beliefs. I think the author tries to read too much into what some of them say.Still, it does make for a very worthwhile read. The author offers many counter-arguments to some of the more outspoken artists' statements toward Christianity in particular. He has a keen understanding of the Christian faith and offers insightful apologetic antidotes. This is especially a worthwhile read if you're interested in knowing the basics of the Christian faith and how it is most often reflected in today's modern popular culture."
3,"Satisfied in Laurel, MD","This book gave me some interesting facts about New York, a place that's cool to shop and be entertained. Oh did I forget to say pricey."
4,Blending his dark ballads...,"A nice blend of his darker ballads. This album illustrates some of his older work, along with newer hits, emphasising his wide talent in creating a variety of musical genius. 'Love isolation' and the deeply dark 'Absolution' are very beautiful songs."
4,Almost Five Stars,"I have loved this movie for some time, and just saw it again. It's entertaining, sweet, and plain old fun.It maybe isn't the most realistic, but for romantic escapism, it's tops. Kevin Klein is great here, as usual, and believable as a Frenchman thief who finds his heart stolen by a whimsical, befuddled woman (Meg Ryan).I'm not a big Meg Ryan fan, but she's wonderful in this piece, and makes a remarkable transformation on screen from horrified, squeaky girl to remarkable and capable woman. Klein undergoes a similar softening transformation. It's a subtle and gradual change for both, and the effectiveness and tightness of the screenplay and dialog contribute to a wonderfully-entertaining overall product that I can watch over and over again.The pacing is great and the supporting characters (particularly the concierge at the hotel) are wonderful and help contribute to the fun.I had a copy, but a friend ""borrowed"" it indefinitely. Now that's a sincere endorsement."
4,"Fun movie, and a sexy side of Kevin Kline I haven't seen before!","This was a great movie from the minute it started until a possibly predictable but still entertaining ending. Of course Meg Ryan's performance was perfect, never over-acted, always quirky, adorable and funny, and her interaction with Kevin Kline was irresistible. I just gave a copy of this movie to a friend of mine who was scheduled to visit but was terrified to fly, immediately remembering Meg Ryan's role in this movie and the funny ways she got over her phobia. Good movie to own."
4,movie,"good condition of the movie nothing special really nothing else that I can said, got home in a good time"
4,This is a great movie,From the begining to the end I was swept away by the wonderful energy that is Meg Ryan. This is a movie that should not be missed.
2,just ok,"It was ok. Wish I could give this a great review, sorry. But, it was still ok, if you're interested."
5,J'taime,"I love seeing Meg Ryan in her prime. This is a sweet, charming, romantic comedy. Not an academy award performance, but still one of my favorites."
4,Can't get enough of Kevin Kline...,"...Love Meg Ryan, too!What better way to have both together!Have this on VHS, figured it was time to move up to DVD.Also bought it for a friend, to make her laugh while out on disability."
3,a pleasant romantic comedy,"Not quite as light as air, but a French thief falls for an angelic American.Meg Ryan is beautiful in this comedy, but besides the Frenchscenes the movie has little to recommend it;a pleasant way to spend and hour or so?"
5,Juicy Kiss Steals My Heart,"Meg Ryan's goofy antics in ""French Kiss"" are as delightful to me with the umpteenth viewing as they were when I first saw the movie over ten years ago. The time in which I saw the movie was a tumultuous one and Kate spoke to me as a character. She finds love where she least expects while giving her cheating fiance his comeuppance. Luc is as sweet as he is street-tough, with the heart of an artist. Their final union is gratifying each viewing. I am happy to finally have my own copy to watch many more times."
5,Chic Flick That Guys Can Appreciate,"Romantics will enjoy this warm and touching love story - even if it's about two failed relationships. The less romantic will enjoy the breathtaking cinematography, the gut wrenching humour or the pure joy and beauty of Meg Ryan. Beyond beauty is her rare ability to capture your heart with Katie Couric-like, girl-next-door approachability and essential cuteness.And the leading guy ain't bad either. His accent seems real and he is French as we would like them to be.This is a great movie...and I bought it after watching it lots of times on HBO. (Okay my wife wanted it for her birthday)."
4,A farcical plot (in a literal sense) that owes more to French cinema than its American counterpart,"A feel-good film, as many reviewers have pointed out, this certainly is. The script captures a very French essence in its absurdness which works very well. Luc, played typically over-the-top by Kevin Kline, steals the film for every man watching as the reformed rogue, but Meg Ryan is extremely lovable too as the reformed conservative and the photography makes good use of Provence and Valbonne Village (where Meg walks around saying 'B-ee-ootiful!'). This is a rom-com that appeals to both sexes, but perhaps for slightly different reasons. It is definitely worth a look if you haven't seen it."
3,Good Movie That's Fun To Watch.,I've viewed this movie two times and have to agree that it's a decent film. I don't think that it's a classic though--just good. Kevin Kline does a great job playing his role (he's also very good in A Fish Called Wanda). Meg Ryan also does a good job in her role. The plot is quite interesting and the scenery is also nice. A movie that's fun to watch.
5,One of my favorites,"this movie is one of my favorites! its just so good, great dialog and acting. i LOVE Kevin Kline in this film."
2,Where's Depardieu when you need him?,"Meg Ryan plays her standard role as marvelously as ever and singlehandedly earns those 2 stars, with an honorable mention to Jean Reno as the French cop. Everything and everyone else totally lacks credibility -- plot, development, dialogue. Granted that Hollywood movies demand a suspension of disbelief, but this is ridiculous. What's more, to a person who does speak French, almost every scene in France is destroyed by the phony and fractured French of the supposedly native French characters (except Anbeh who performs creditably most of the time as Juliette, and of course the few truly French members of the cast)."
2,Always makes me happy!,I have watched this wonderful movie so many times I know all the dialogue.The acting is perfect! The music well choosen.This is my favorite modern romantic comedy. I make all of my friends watch it and they become fans as well.
1,Didn't work.,"Disc did not play, regardless of attempts with computers and multiple DVD players. Appears fine, but didn't work. Will try returning."
2,Cute movie - but there are better ones,"It's entertaining, if you're able to really suspend your sense of reality. It was really hard to fall for Kevin Kline's character the way you needed to, in order to really feel the compulsion she has to stay with him. The ending was a bit strange, as though they just ran out of things to do. All in all - rent this first or buy it used, it's not worth full price. Grab Notting Hill instead."
5,The ultimate in romantic comedy!,"For anyone who can appreciate romance, fun, and the beauty of French culture, this is the film for you. Meg Ryan is adorable, as usual, and Kevin Kline does an impeccable job as a rough Frenchman, nearly stumping even my French family with his accent! Everything about this film is charming, and it will have you laughing 'til your stomach hurts and falling in love with it all over again every time you watch it. I have seen it more times than I could ever remember, and I love it more each time. Truly perfect for both men and women. You've gotta see it!"
1,DEFECTIVE BLU RAY 2 TIMES!!!,"I ORDERED THE NEW RELEASED BLURAY EDITION AND THERE WAS A VISIBLE DEFECT ON THE DISC AND IT STOPS AT TRACK #2!RETURN IT AND ORDERED A REPLACEMENT, SAME THING!!!BUYERS BE AWARE!"
4,Delightful romantic comedy,Keven Kline does a fabulous job. He's almost more believable as a Frenchman than Jean Reno! Watch this one with someone you love.
3,A good date movie,"One can tolerate Meg Ryan if the story is fun, and a good cast is present (Sleepless..., You've Got Mail). The best part is listening to Kevin Kline's accent, and of course watching the terrific Jean Reno, somewhat wasted here in a minor role. The French countryside is a bonus. Bring a couple of hankies for the ending."
4,Terrific romantic comedy.,"Charming characters caught up in an unexpected set of circumstances -- loved Kevin Kline as the unromantic Frenchman who keeps stealing soft looks at Meg Ryan -- a woman who will do anything for love. Like the best of all romantic comedys, this one places an unlikely couple in close contact over a period of days and love blooms. They meet on an airplane as she is chasing down an errant boy friend with his eye on a drop dead gorgeous French woman. They continue because the Kline character, Luc, has stashed something valuable in her bag to get through customs and he doesn't want to let her out of sight. Go along for the ride -- its great. And, its technically good film making too."
3,Chick-flick alert!,"I used to really like this movie, French Kiss starring Meg Ryan but it is a little dated and cliched now. Kevin Kline is excellent and Ryan brings hypersensitvity and vulnerablity to this film but the story is just your run-of-the-mill romantic comedy. If you want a great Meg Ryan movie, I would watch When Harry Met Sally or Sleepless in Seattle."
5,Watched it a dozen times!,"I've seen this movie so many times I had to go to Paris to see the sites for myself! Meg plays a woman ""going through a tansition"" after her fiance leaves her. Of course it takes place in Paris. And Kevin Klein gives an excellent performance. Buy the tape just to see the dialouge between Ryan and Klein on the plane. It is hillarious!"
4,Loved it wish you where here!,"I want, I want, I want you to give this movie a try. If you love Meg Ryan it is a must own. Me and my friends quote more lines from this movie than any other movie."
3,Fun movie,"I enjoyed this movie when I first saw it so decided to add it to my collection. Frankly, both Meg andKevin's characters are pretty annoying but I still decided to purchase it."
3,Cute,"Well, I watched this movie years ago and it isn't at all what the title says. This movie has nothing to do with a french kiss (or sex really). I wish they wouldn't have named it that. In fact, I took two stars off for the name. It is a funny entertaining movie and Meg Ryan is adorable in it. For fiction, it's a fun one."
3,Not bad for a rainy afternoon.,"This movie isn't one that I would go to the movies to see, but is worth watching on a rainy afternoon at home. It's cute, and will do in a pinch. I'd buy it again for that purpose."
2,Get what you pay for.,Glass quality is subpar and has a slight bevel to it causing the outer edges of the mirror to appear warped. Should have just replaced my entire assembly with factory parts. Guess for the price I paid it will make due!
2,Disappointing,"This series has ""digitally restored"" written on the box, but the quality is quite poor with static and film defects on screen at all times and poor sound quality. I'd excuse this if the show were a bit more entertaining. I had hoped that this would be similar to ""The Adventures of Robin Hood"" series from the same era, which has a variety of entertaining stories and charming characters. Unfortunately, the stories seem pretty flat and contrived. Lancelot also looks completely like a 50's-style pretty boy with a bit of a pompadour rather than looking as if he belongs in the period the story takes place in. What is worse, the acting really isn't all that good.This isn't an awful series, but it isn't a particularly good one either. If you're looking for a period adventure series set in medieval times, I'd go for Robin Hood with Richard Greene. It's better value for the money and has superior acting and stories."
5,A Slaying In Scotland,"Jessica Fletcher anda group of her friends from Cabot Cove, Maine, take off for teh British Isles and end up at a castle in Scotland. It would be a great vacation -- except for the ghost. And the murders.Scotland's most celebrated witch, executed long ago with a pitchfork through her heat, is said to haunt Inspector George Sutherland's family castle in the village of Wick. It's an intriguing tale and after a British book tour, Jessica accepts Sutherland's invitation to bring her Cabot Cove friends to the heather-covered Highlands. Indeed, after ""roamin' in the gloamin'"" with the handsome inspector, she spots a spectral woman in white in the gloomy castle. But Jessica's blood runs cold when she later finds a local lass executed in the same way as the legendary witch. Something is very vile in Wick. It's a case of evil, greed, and murder that pits Jessica Fletcher against a killer from this world--or maybe the next."
5,The Best Murder She Wrote book ever,My mom got me into the Murders She Wrote books. This by far is the best one! I have read them all and this is my all time favorite. This is an awesome book to have. If you love mysteries you will love this book.
5,Delightful reconnection of Jessica and Scotland Yard Detective George Sutherland,"Mrs. F and some of her Cabot Cove friends travel to Scotland to visit the ancestral home of Jessica's ""beau"" George Sutherland and have a more interesting vacation than they were expecting.As usual, Donald Bain weaves a lighthearted mystery around Jessica and her friends. This book, however, really kept me glued to it's suspense so much so that I finished it in 2 days! Didn't see the twist at the end which thoroughly delighted me!Gives a good look at small town Scottish life with all of it's idiosyncrasies."
2,That's NOT Jessica Fletcher I like,"Jessica Fletcher is invited by her friend, George Sutherland, to visit his castle in Scotland. But the castle is rumored to be cursed by the witch executed centuries ago. Bizarre incidents happen one after another, and superstitious people blame George and his castle.I like ""Murder, She Wrote"" TV series and I expected this novelization was also nice. But I am disappointed. This book's Jessica lacks the most important quality that makes her successful as a mystery writer and a sleuth; namely curiosity. Every time an incident happens, she dismisses it to enjoy her vacation. That's not an attitude of a sleuth. That's NOT Jessica Fletcher I like. Just an ordinary amiable lady.And the truth is extremely easy to guess. I feel that the author deliberately keeps Jessica inactive to lengthen the story. Indeed, in the last 50 pages, Jessica gets suddenly active and easily solves the mystery. Disappointed."
2,The exception to the rule,"If you love Greyhawk, you will love the Gord books - period. There is only one exception, and that is ""City of Hawks"".Gary Gygax tried to change the background of the Gord-stories in mid-stride. What originally (in Saga of Old City) seemed to be fate or cunning of the hero is now ""unmasked"" to be meddling of powers.It is obvious that these developments are NOT what EGG originally intended. There are major breaks in continuity and outright contradictions. In the context of the Gord-story, this book had best not been written. Anyway, since the rest of the books is 4 to 5-star reading, and since everyone owning the other books also has this one, there is just one advice: Read this one last (after Dance of Demons), so as to not spoil the storyline."
5,"Cute, Cute, Cute",I like the size of this little book...perfect for little hands and the pictures are darling.
2,little board book,"I had wanted to give this little board book as a gift but have chosen not to because it doesn't look new. The cover looks used, not exactly tattered but just not fresh. Wouldn't want a prospective mom to think I was giving used books as gifts! ( I use it at home for little visitors : )"
5,My almost 6 year old enjoys this one!,"I purchased this Kindergarten software for my soon to be 6 year old. I was hoping it would not be ""too elementary"" for her. She just started Kindergarten this month (September) and will turn 6 at the end of this month. And, I'm happy to say that it is not. Although Blues Clues is probably geared toward the younger kids, it's not that way with this software. She truly enjoys the assignments....and I still like hearing Blues voice!"
1,Drop the Book and Run,"The only panic I felt was how to put he book down fast enough. I should not try and read these types of books because I never seem to really enjoy them, but this book just did not turn me on. It was like the author took the characters from Wall Street and gave them narcotics. It just was a slow book."
4,I enjoyed this workout,"It is an enjoyable work out if you enjoy dancing. it is not a quick workout if you are press for time, well over 30 minutes from warmup-workout-cooldown. There is a slight language barrier, she occasionally utilizes the wrong word to instruct you on what she would like you to do, but she is easy to follow, energetic and lots of fun. It is worth the buy."
3,Nice idea.. but not-so-nice technique,"What a wonderful idea! Dance workouts from different genres and cultures to spice up exercise and make it enjoyable. But knowing 3 of these genres--bellydance, Indian dance, and salsa--I find the technique falls short badly. Still, I think anyone who wants it for the workout and is willing to drop expectations of the dance aspect, should like it."
3,"Fun, but not a great workout","I purchased this DVD because it has a variety of dances in it and I really wanted a good workout that was fun. I like that this program is fun and especially like the Flamenco. I love the warm-up because it really stretches my back and hip area. I didn't need to do the tutorial to figure out the dance moves and have never watched Elsa's performance.I thought some of the transitions between moves where they spliced together the DVD were not smooth, so I get messed up at those places. During Bollywood, she says ""Your paradise to...(two names inaudible to me)"" and in the cool down, she says something about touching the temple walls, so I wonder what she's getting to by saying those things. It didn't give me as good of a cardio workout as I had hoped and I also noticed that Elsa isn't as tone as I'd expect an instructor to be, so I added Jamie Brenkus's ""8 Min. Abs"" and ""8 Min. Buns"" from the ""8 Minute Workouts"" series to my routine (it's old, but good)."
4,worth every penny,"At first it seemed to me that perhaps Elsa Leandros was spreading herself too thin with so many styles. Great dancer that she is, she handles each dance quite well and she keeps the ""flavor"" of each intact. I tried to follow the workouts, but I found myself going back to the instructional part of the DVD. It did make it a lot easier for me to learn the steps. Elsa looks like she's having fun in the workouts with her beautiful smile and energy, and yet, you don't have to hear the constant words of encouragement you hear on other DVDs. The ladies behind Elsa are all quite lovely and pleasant to watch. I like the fact that I'm learning a little bit of this and a little bit of that as I exercise. I only wish the workouts were longer than the 7 or 8 minutes each."
1,Not appropriate for anyone,"I don't ususally write reviews, but I couldn't possibly keep my mouth shut about this DVD.This is just an aweful product. Elsa cannot be a proffesional dancer, she is just awful. Her hands are way too flimsy. She reminds me of the wanna-be professional dancers at my family get-togethers. Not only are the dance steps way too basic to keep the beginner interested for more than a couple of tries, but it's just not good sense to learn from someone who doesn't have decent technique. You don't want bad habits to rub off on you and then have to unlearn that [...].It's not even worth returning the DVD. I only get 50% back because I opened it, and then the shipping fee is taken off my refund. I may get a dollar back on my credit card if I'm lucky, but I'm still doing it, just on principle.[...]."
2,Disappointing,"It seems this DVD put together by amateurs - it is organised quite clearly, but is very bland with predominantly one camera angle (as though the camera was left on a tripod while the instructor danced her routine). The instructions are fairly clear as well, but overall quite uninspiring. I normally am easily moved to dance, and I expected this DVD (at a minimum) to motivate me, but instead found myself bored and discouraged. I am regretful that I wasted my money."
4,Perfect for a beginner dancer!,"My daughter gave me this dvd and I really like it! The steps are simple and easy to follow. The movements are fun and Elsa looks like she's having fun. As a recreational dancer, I learned the movements quickly and was able to follow along. I recommend it!"
2,She Can Teach but Cannot Dance,"This DVD is great for learning the steps, and good for beginners. However the ""performance"" sections do not show proper technique and give poor examples of how the dances should be performed. They truly are not worth watching.Elsa's movements in all but the Flamenco are not true to form and not in the least bit fluid, they are jerky and spasmodic. I love performances and these made me nervous to watch and I felt embarrassed for her. I'm stunned that they were included and I'm questioning the professionalism of company who published this DVD."
3,Danish Runaway Slides Downhill,"Nick (played by Christian Tadrup) is a teen runaway from a complex Danish family. He becomes the boy-toy of a closeted, older man with an interest in astronomy and also becomes acquainted with a group of hustler teens. Nick tries other, often more helpful approaches. As adult support for Nick flickers on and off, he becomes more dependent on the hustler gang and goes along with its thefts and vandalism. He develops a sexual relationship with a female member of the gang who presents herself as male. His sexuality is fluid, and his emotional commitments are weak. Nick's world seems to cycle downward. How will it end?Other than some trailers and subtitles, there are no extras on this DVD.Note that the earlier, videotape edition had several frontal nudity scenes of Nick. The DVD edition has edited those out completely."
1,Disappointing....,"I was looking forward to this ""Picture This"" DVD release but was disappointed to see it so censored and cut... try to find the original uncensored Award Films VHS release before buying this over priced DVD. Although it is ""out of print"" the VHs tape sometimes shows up on used shelves and auctions."
3,Not bad but not worth owning,"Back in 1993 this film would have been provocative and edgy, but contemporary audiences may find the storyline predictable and timid in its portrayal of street hustlers. I know I did. Yes, the lead actor is a very pretty boy and does a fine performance with the material he has. But for [...] viewers hoping to find a kindred spirit, the character of Nick may disappoint. He does not even kiss any of the men involved and the pack of boys seem sexless outside of their ""work."" I recommend renting rather than owning this film as one viewing is enough."
2,A halfway interesting trash cinema atrocity,"Besides a glimpse or two of pretty boy's buttocks, the film has little to recommend it. Sordid scenes, pointless drama, lowlife scum, a world of guttersnipes and rogues. How it all ends, I forget. It's definitely a six or seven-beer movie. Not erotic, not sexy, not redeeming in any way, shape, or form. And a foreign language to boot. Care to read subtitles throughout a two star movie?"
1,Another Overpriced Combat Conditioning Type Book,"This book, like Combat Conditioning, is way overpriced for the simple ab exercises that you can get free on Men's Health webpage or numberous other internet sites like Clarence Bass's site. I have to hand it to Matt he is a master at marketing his junk books as he runs ads in several magazines. Also he must not practice what he preaches as his abs need a lot of work."
2,Not up to her regular standard.,"I have read previous books y Ms. Morgan and was really disappointed with this particular one. It did not hold my attention, the characters were too extreme with emotions I wasn't able to relate to. For sci-fi love stories, give me some more of those cat-men stories."
2,Very dissapointed by this book!,"I was very dissapointed, not even iinto the third chapter when I became bore with the book. Is not the first time that I read a book by Ms. Morgan, but it is the first time that she hasn't come trhu for me. I love the subjet matter, but neither the characters not anyone in the story could held my attention nor my interest."
4,Good white coat book,"This is a small handbook that fits perfectly into your white coat. It has good tables and lists. However, I found that its index was poor. This is possibly because the book was translated from German. But, I still think this book is extemely useful because of all the info it packs."
5,The Venture Academy DVD set is a very effective training and equipping tool,"This DVD collection is an outstanding resource for anyone who desires to train and equip themselves and/or their family in solid business principles and practice.The DVD series starts with an excellent presentation of the vision of entrepreneurship as an individual or with one's family -- from a Christian/Biblical perspective. This forms a solid foundation upon which anyone can build and develop their knowledge and skills to succeed in business.With his characteristic clarity, wit, and wisdom Mr. Myers leads his audience/students through detailed lessons and practice exercises covering every major component of the standard Harvard MBA program. Comprehensive and thorough in nature, the teachings on this DVD collection provide the necessary tools for any aspiring Christian entrepreneur to perform with excellence."
3,"Decent recipes, but really could use a professional editor","The recipes are fine -- they're simple, fast and the results are good. However, this book really needs a good editing. There's a good story to be told and a decent idea, but the writing could really use some polishing."
2,"Decent recipes, sloppy editing",The recipes are okay. The food isn't bad. What's annoying is the constant little mistakes in the writing.
3,Needs more engineering,Seat cover has only a strap by the head to hold it onto the seat. Because there is nothing at the middle or bottom it slides out when you get out and slides away when you get in. This picture seems to be a deep pile sheepskin but it is actually a short / fine pile.
5,as i remembered,i was very pleased with this movie. it was as i remembered it. good picture and sound. good case art. that is very important to me as i am a collector of old b and w horror.
4,Excellent,I saw this on television one summer when I was 10 years old. Forrest Tucker's frantic final scenes stuck with me for 30 years. I trace my love of the genre to this movie.
4,1st Disc defective; 2nd Disc OK,"I just received this DVD a couple of days ago and tried to play it on two different players---each time the error message said ""invalid"". Amazon is promptly processing my return and I've opted for refund instead of exchange. I assume this is indeed a region 1 disc--but maybe there's a bad batch out there that are defective. I really wanted this movie---but I will wait a while before trying to reorder.Update: I ordered another version of this disc recently and it plays fine. My first disc must have been a one off defect. The film is excellent and the DVD image is fine."
3,Talker's review.,"This Is a pretty good movie for a very early hammer film.[But not worth $19.97]. A color version would have been outstanding. Could have used a little more action, But none the less a pretty good movie....[p]."
5,Simple and Fun,"The move Abominable Snowman was one I remembered seeing on late night tv back when they used to show great older movies on lots of local stations. What I like about the movie is it doesnt depend on a lot of special effects , it has atmosphere and a couple pretty good actors in Forrest Tucker and Peter Cushing. The movie has some suspense , some science fiction and a tiny bit of horror. It is a film the whole family can watch without worrying about foul language or nudity. Great for a late night movie with plenty of popcorn."
5,Early Hammer Horror Gem,"Made at the end of the Yeti speculationof the 50's, this early Hammer release is a deceptively well made thriller. Theplot is sound, the photography,art direction and music create tremendousatmosphere and the acting is uniformallyfine (Cushing in particular). Recommended for those who enjoyed ""Curse of the Demon"", ""Horror Hotel"" and ""The Haunting""- great black and white chills."
3,Intellectual horror from hammer!,"This is a genuinely unnerving horror from hammer, that unusually focuses more on the unseen rather than the seen. This may make it slow at the beginning, but stick with it and there are great rewards. As always with Kneale the themes run thicker than you may think at first, and the statement on mankind is fairly damning. All very thought-provoking and unnerving, this is one of hammer's best efforts, benefiting greatly from Cushing's presence as usual. The dvd picture quality is excellent for such an old film, and the commentary track is as honest and as revealing as one could hope for from director Val Guest and writer Nigel Kneale. The documentary is interesting for the clips of other hammer films, but is as vapid and cheap as every other one in the series. In summary, Anchor Bay should be congratulated for the extraordinary amount of effort they continue putting into these disks."
3,Best Bootleg Copy Every,"This is a total bootleg copy, but it is the best copy I've ever seen. It's on a DVD-R disc, but the picture is great, the sound is great and the menus look great. Be weary it may not work on old or cheaper DVD players. Amazon really needs to check it's sources more carefully. This is the second old movie I've ordered directly from amazon that was a bootleg, but the other one was terrible; PC menus and blurry shakey video. Be sure to check the reviews before purchasing stuff."
2,Drive-in movie,"This predictable turkey is best viewed in a drive-in theater, where other Val Guest films regularly appear. Which is to say, watch the movie while you have other things in mind. Yes, this is sort of campy fun. The Buddhists dancing and hopping about, the Buddhist leader with a German accent, the monkey in a cage, etc. But it's still wise for one's mental health to be thinking of something else, as this film is geared to the 14-year-olds of 1957. Not a very sophisticated audience."
4,Peter Cushing.,"Peter Cushing shines through,as Dr.John Rollason. An exploration team in the Himalayas searches for the legendary Yeti. Anchor Bay Have done an excellent job in the transfer of this 1957 Black and White film,in original ratio of 2.35:1. Only traces of grain can be seen,otherwise,a sharp,blemish-free picture."
3,"""Light"" Foundation is orange in tone, but the Matte finish is nice!","I ordered ""Light"" and the matte finish is great, but it takes a lot of work ""buffing"" the product onto/into my skin to make it work. I can't use this foundation to build any coverage without it being really obvious on my skin. I had to use my regular "" powder [...] on top to de-orange the tone. I'm wishing I'd ordered ""Fair"" instead, otherwise it's a good product."
1,Never received item,"I have used this makeup that was purchased from another store and I love the Bare Minerals powder, but I ordered this same makeup from CT Beauty on Sept. 14, 2012 and I NEVER received it!! Today is Oct. 16, 2012. The makeup itself is nice, so I would recommend it to anyone who want a nice, even skin tone without the heavy look of makeup, but I am highly disappointed with the company from which I ordered it from!!"
5,Does not make my acne worse & I generally like it,"Really glad I switched to mineral makeup. It goes on smoothly, stays all day; looks and feels good. I chose the matte because I had read that the original formula contains Bismuth Oxychloride, which can be an acne-inducer. My skin is acne-prone, combo w/ a fairy oily t-zone. I use the matte powder over Murad's oil-controlling mattifer and I am shine-free all day.Though I do not think this product actually improved my skin's condition (after about a month of use, anyway), it hasn't hurt it, either, and I like using it.However, if you buy the kit, FYI, I don't think the brushes are all that. Get a set of EcoTools - I liked 'em way better."
5,Awesome for Oily/Acne Skin!,"I was already a huge fan of the bareMinerals products, but this one is even greater! It has helped my face look less oily throughout the day, and it doesn't clog my pores. SPF 15 is awesome too because I don't have to worry about putting another product on my sensitive face. It doesn't spill out all over the place either because you can twist the edge to lock it. So awesome! I really hope they NEVER discontinue this product because I will use it forever!"
1,Don't waste your money!!!!,"I used to use the original Bare Minerals, it covered well but it was too shiny. It didn't help that I have an oily T-zone. When I saw this product I thought it would be great since it's for oily skin, but I was wrong....so wrong. After about an hour, the makeup ""slides"" off of my nose and chin and clumps up, leaving bare spots. So of course I have to reapply to those areas, but it looks horrible since it's all clumped. There is no ""smoothing"" it back out. I ordered the fair shade but it's still too dark for me. This matte version does not cover well at all. I've tired with just the matte makeup, using with the Bare Minerals primer, and with concealer, but it still doesn't cover the redness on my skin. Oh, and if you have even the smallest wrinkles, it will cause them to stand out horribly. I will never waste my money on any of these products ever again."
5,The best Makeup Every!,"This is the best makeup that I have ever used. I now use my regular liquid/cream makeup to touch up really bad, bad spots on my face and this makeup to cover all the rest. It is absolutely natural looking, I love it and and I have had a lot of compliments since I started using this makeup!"
4,Not the same color,"This is the second time that I bought this product. I love the over all product however, I ordered the same color I did the time before and it was a lot lighter. If it had not been the middle of the summer I may have really loved this color. As far as the product goes I never thought anyone could get me away from foundation. Now I can't remember the last time I used it. The coverage with this powerder is amamzing!"
5,"LOVE, LOVE, LOVE!","I ran out a few weeks ago and decided to frequent my local beauty retailer and purchased a sub-par ""mineral"" cover up. Needless to say, I should have just stuck with what I know works! BareMinerals is spectacular, provides phenomenal coverage, and lasts nearly all day. I would recommend going in to a local store to find the tone that works for your skin before ordering online. Once you have that figured out, order away = )This product does not cause my skin to break out at all and like they say, you can fall asleep without washing your face and not wake up with a big zit! Another up side is that you can adjust the amount of coverage."
4,I would buy this again,"I bought the starter pack of the regular Bare Escentuals, which I liked, but the finish was a little too sparkly or shiny for me. I like the matte look of this powder. I can go to the gym after work, and it doesn't run off my face like regular makeup. The only thing I don't really like is the way Amazon or Sephora displays the colors. I would have bought the lighter shade, but it looked like 'Fairly Light' was correct. Just a tiny bit too dark, but it's very blendable."
4,Its the good stuff,"I ordered the matte and got the original, which was obviously the sellers fault, but this stuff is a great product. I have oily skin which is why I ordered the matte in the first place, but the original formula did a pretty good job too. It covers amazingly well, I wear it all day without breaking out and it layers really nicely so you can go casual or dressy. This stuff is amazing. (If your oily, get the matte)"
3,bareMinerals Matte Foundation,"After watching commercials, was excited to try this makeup and brush. It's a total let down. I have pale skin so purchased the fair makeup & brush. Doesn't look like makeup. Goes on like light powder. Not at all what I was expecting. Thought there would be coverage especially for my freckles and age spots. It doesn't cover anything & just looks like you put powder on your face with no makeup. Not like the commercials advertise. Lastly, this product is small and not worth the price they charge for it. I would not recommend this product. Thumbs down for me."
2,Expired product...disappointed.,"I have used this foundation for years and was excited to find it on Amazon since I'm a Prime member and could get it fast with my free two-day shipping. The product is new in the box, but it expired in November of 2011. I just ordered it now in May of 2012. Since I don't want to hassle with returning it, I am keeping it, but am disappointed that they didn't say anything about it being expired and that I had to pay full price (what I would have payed for it in the store) for an expired item."
1,Not authentic,"Apparent Chinese knock off. Container smaller than those purchased at Sephora...and container appeared altered in some fashion...less product in container that should be expected, even though container was some ""odd"" size. I'll stick to purchasing directly form the store from now on."
5,LOVE THE MATTE FINISH.... looks like I am airbrushed...,"Have always loved Bare Minerals, but sometimes still felt shiny mid morning... this MATTE finish Bare Minerals is the best! Will continue to purchase this.... dont ever discontinue this type please!"
4,Good for sheer coverage,"This is my first mineral foundation, normally I stick to my Revlon liquid foundation, but I decided to give something lighter a try. I have extremely fair skin, with a lot of red in it, so I bought this foundation just to even out my skin tone without looking like I'm wearing a lot of makeup. And that it does!It's just not a whole lot of coverage, I typically have to apply concealer to any imperfections over the powder. If you do too many layers, it starts to look cake-y, and nobody wants that. So typically, it's good for good-skin days, but on not-so-good-skin-days, I stick with more of a fuller-coverage foundation."
1,love product but this color is off,I have been a customer of this product for several years. This is first time I bought off amazon. I get the same color every time. This color was off..it was not the same that I bought in the store..it is darker..which gave me an orange tint. Not sure why...unless this is where they sell not to par products. Other than that Bare Essentials is a great product. BUY IT...but maybe you should buy it at a local store.
5,happy girl,"Item was delivered in 3 days! Exactly what I wanted. I've been a Bare Minerals customer for 4 years, and will not use anything else. Sold on first use!"
5,The Legends never lets me down...,"The Grouch comes through hella big on this joint. As if the mind alluring beats aren't enough he hits you off with the on the mark lyrics to pop off your top.I just say them live, and they are even better in person. It's good to see a cat like the grouch who just flows about the everyday instead of what he doesn't have or what isn't real. I can honestly say that I have never been disappointed with any of the LL Crew whether it's together or solo. The grouch is a refreshing departure from cats like Eminem, and Dre. Legends never die. I just hope they keep coming through. West Coast underground to the fullest."
5,ahhhhhhhh crazy good album!!,"The grouch seems to never dissapoint me with the albums he puts out. Making perfect sense is an album that any underground hip hop fan needs to pick up. i've been bumpin this a while now, its real good. His beats are just so good and his flow goes so well with it. I recommend this! Buy it! buy it! buy Now!! You wont be dissapointed.."
5,Great Bedtime Read!,"My daughter (18 mos. old) loves this story! We read it every night before she goes to sleep, at her request. I often use the text to play with her hair as we read, which she also seems to enjoy enough that now all I have to do is recite the book from memory to get her to sit still long enough to put in pig tails. I really like that each of the illustrations has a different skin tone- it's an important detail that could have been easily overlooked by a less inspired artist."
5,"Hurry up, Dark Horse","Short review-Dark Horse is doing an excellent job on their translations for Trigun. All honorifics are left in.About the actual content- This volume's mostly filler, following the fifth moon incident. Wolfwood's huge cross is revealed to be a machine gun, and Vash is still a god with his revolver. The art is pretty sketchy, but I still love Nightow-san's syle.Also, there's been some talk about Vash's 'new' look. Most Americans have seen the anime, in which he keeps his original look the entire time, before reading the original manga, in which Vash's look abruptly changes in Maximum. Vash's new coat is a little crazy looking, but/so it fits Vash's personality a bit more. What's more, does it really matter what Vash looks like? He's still Vash.9.5/10"
3,not xs,"My yorkie is xsmall in all products but this cap is too bigger, XSmall looks like Small size, but quality is ok"
2,disappointed ... not teased,"The video promises far more than it delivers. The viewer is less ""teased"" than left wondering what in the world is going on in the first place! In each of the video segments the viewer is drawn into the lives of the various women and left wondering about the problems & motivations that drive each of them. In each of the segments there is limited character development so that the viewer is left trying to understand the complex elements of their lifestyles."
1,Miserable.,"Completely and utterly miserable. I bought this because I heard the song ""Thrown into Oblivion"" by itself and thought it sounded pretty good. Then I saw the CD on here for all of 53 cents and figured I might as well give it a shot. Now I wish I hadn't wasted my money. I put it in my CD player and by the third track I was sick of it. Every song sounds exactly the same as the others. No, I'm not exaggerating. It's as though they went to the Wesley Willis School of Songwriting. And that is an insult to poor Wesley (god rest), who had an excuse. I doubt the members of disgust can claim Chronic Schizophrenia caused them to commit creative atrocity.So, to summarize, don't buy it. Even though it only costs 53 cents. Don't waste your money. Your 53 cents is better used in one of those crane machines with all the stuffed animals, even though you rarely win."
2,Preface to Marketing Management,"Adequate as a required text. Would only buy it because it is required. The saving grace is that the title does say it is a preface to marketing management. It is not a primer on marketing management, but a preface to such a text.The index is woefully inadequate.The book does give an overview of some basic marketing activities. Some definitions and examples could be presented more clearly and consistently.I will be selling this book after the class that required it."
4,Faux Lime slices,"This product is very realistic but the only negative is that the plastic that it's made out of really smell, even after cleaning it with soap/water, the smell didnt' go away. I would put again though as it is a nice product."
2,"Not worth it, unfortunately","First let me say, the West ladies were very nice and I truly believed they knew their way around the garden. It was a nice video and actually seemed to me the unscripted family project of the summer, with Mom and the girls as the stars. That being said, in this video these ladies have an enormous garden, full off all sorts of flowers, vegetables, and herbs. How long is this video? 49 minutes. I really felt like they could have chosen to show many, many more vegetables and tips, but for some reason chose to focus very narrowly on a few subjects. I did not doubt their expertise, but I just felt this very short DVD did not live up to its title."
2,Not enough information for the cost.,"Although the West ladies are delightful, friendly people, I found this dvd to have very little real information on gardening. I took away from it 2 good ideas, one for planting potatoes and the other for an ""easy instant garden"" but the price is hardly worth it. If you really want to get your moneys worth, check out Penelope Hobhouse DVD's. Not only are there several hours full of gorgeous gardens to inspire, but a lot of good information for every kind of garden you can imagine."
1,It's a Joke that's not funny!,Don't waste your money. I don't even no why I'm wasting my time typing this out. I will be sending mine back.
5,The Best of the Best,"It is not easy to make a judgement just for one pleasent moment you have lisenting a good music. But if you have more than 10 years lisenting this same disc and your opinnion doesn?t change, then it is time to say, Yes this is one of my favorite music I have and enjoyed.the first time I heard Karunesh in the new age kind of music, as many of music lisenters, was by accident, I bought some cd,s and try all of them, and very soon I was captured for the Karunesh style. Later I look for more music of him, and I know that this musician has the talent to transport you trought wonderfull worlds in your mind. Try whatever music of Karunesh but, please don?t forget to lisent Heart Symphnoy his Masterpiece"
1,product is not good it doesnt play well in dvd players its stop all the time,"sorry i think what inside of it is good but i have 3 dvd players the dvd will stop in all of them, i hope to get my money back of sent me a different set of dvd"
3,LIKE A SUN ABOUT TO GO NOVA,"this is the reissue of red kross' debut album. redd kross to me are a great band full of meldoy and fun and great pop hooks and unlike most bands that trade melody for pop appeal, redd kross revel in pop but retain the music quality.this being their first album, i had to check it out. what i found was a great punk album. it is very unpolished and it is blantant that RK are amatuers during this album. they have not blossomed yet but it is all part of the trip of growing up as a band and this record shows that. to me its great. this band is not even old enough to vote yet... but that does not stop the good snotty teen punk from being melodic and great. one can see the shapes of things to come. you can see shadows of future redd kross sounds and melodies but it is still a very very unpolished record and quite different from later more focused redd kross albums."
2,No elastic or drawstring,"I recently bought furniture covers for all our patio furniture. While it may be my mistake in not reading the description fully but this cover just has small velcro straps at the corners. All the other covers (same brand) had elastic drawstrings and plastic buckle fasteners. The cover works and has so far stayed on the table, but it is early in the winter."
5,"the groundbreaking, genius theology of ""Mannie"" Kant","great theological lectures by probably the greatest western philosopher who ever lived. woo-hoo! go Kant! this book is NOT INTIMIDATING! I was worried this would be a difficult read, but it is very straight-forward and the overall literary structure is not nearly as convoluted as his critiques and essays. If you like Immanuel Kant's school of thought and are interested in rational theology, then by all means buy this great book."
5,"If this book doesn't make you think, nothing will!","This is one of the best books I've read in a LONG time, ever perhaps. I zipped right through it and enjoyed every word. Not only was it incredibly easy to read, but it had tips and ideas that can apply to anyone. I've never really sat and thought about how the Europeans live in comparison to how Americans but some of the differences are startling. I won't divulge any of the book but I will say that I plan to incorporate more than a few of them into my daily life. I plan to go back and re-read this book again, making notes of the things that really speak to me. I also plan to give everyone on my 2006 Christmas list a copy to read for themselves. It is a gift... give it to yourself! You won't regret it! Happy reading!"
2,Don't waste your money,"This video is not a video for a young child just learning how to use a potty. It is more for the child who just needs some brushing up on how to have good potty hygiene. The whole story line is this 4yr olds birthday party. They make the trip to the potty fun. The message being that the party will still be there when you get back. The typical 4yr old dilemma, do I leave the fun or hold it. It does show his little sister in the potty training phase, but it only touches on it VERY briefly. The story line is quite borring and in my opinion DUMB.. My daughter never really got into it. Bottom line there are a lot of better potty videos out there. We like ""once Upon A Potty"" for the just learning set."
3,Nice little book,This is a good book to introduce children into history. Ladybird has a reputation of making nice children books with great illustrations. The editions I used in Grammar school were different than this one though. I prefer the old one and wish I had kept it. It's worth a lot of money now.
3,A Captivating Start....,"I was absolutely captivated at the start of this book and stayed up much too late reading. By just past the middle however, my interest started to wane.A very well-written book, with believable characters, but IMHO it should have been wrapped up a couple of chapters sooner.I've read many of Ms. Coulter's books and the first half of this is in my opinion one of her very best."
5,Oldie but goodie,Beyond Eden (Contemporary Romantic ThrillerThis is an oldie but good solid story of real romance and caring with a dash of mystery tossed in for interest.
1,no way,"i did not even got through half of the book, that's how much i hated BEYOND EDEN. JUST TURNED ME OFF."
4,Refreshing departure from Ms. Coulter's FBI series books,"I've read numerous Coulter books in the last several years. While I honestly enjoy Coulter's FBI thrillers, I found this a nice departure from those themes and characters. Lindsey ""Eden"" Foxe is a believable and interesting character. I could not put this one down. It was a very good read."
5,A novel I constantly find myself picking up to read again...,"""Beyond Eden"" is a fabulous book. The emotion I felt for the characters was bone deep. Taylor and Lindsey were two mismatched characters that found acceptance in eachother's embrace.Lindsey(Eden) was an affection depraved, naive teenager taken advantage of by a cruel brother-in-law, hated by her half sister, and despised by her own father. She found protection behind a false identity and aloof facade. She had things settled..until Taylor happened in.S.C Taylor was a perfect candidate for Eden. He was compassionate and loving to Lindsey as herself, but also solid and steady for Eden, her model persona. He showed her a side of herself she thought she had lost a long time ago and a love so potent that she just couldn't escape.I have already recommended this book to friends, but I didn't borrow my copy out for worry of wanting to read it again and not having it on hand."
1,WARNING: The Very Worst of Kolchak!!!,"Understand -- I am the world's biggest NIGHT STALKER fan. I saw the premiere at age 11. I own every single episode on video, and both movies. Karl Kolchak is the funniest, coolest, most exciting monster hunter in the world!But don't buy this video. TREVI COLLECTION and YOUTH KILLER are the two weakest episodes in the series. TREVI is about a witch who kills a bunch of fashion models. There are no scares, just really lame stuff with mannequins coming to life and some poor girl getting scalded in the shower. It's ugly, not scary. Lara Parker from DARK SHADOWS is okay, but not really good as a truly evil human being.YOUTH KILLER is so bad it should never even have aired. It feels like a ""half speed"" episode in slow motion. There's an ancient Greek goddess causing young singles to age overnight because somehow it helps her stay alive forever. Very poor episode, no action and a lot of needless mockery of the elderly and singles."
1,Does not hold up in cold!,"This product seemed great until it got cold. I live in Maryland, so it's not super cold but it is below freezing most of the winter. This patio cover became brittle as soon as it got below freezing, and ripped like paper when I tried to shift it. I could have handled a small tear, but it just kept getting bigger (flapping in the wind) and then ripped in other places until it was barely covering the table. It might seem like a good price but it's not worth it if you live where it gets cold and have to replace it every winter!"
2,Worked while it lasted,"I bought this in October 2009. It worked well to keep the rain off our table and chairs. The main problem is that it kept blowing off, even when tied. I went to put it back on again today (Jan 2011) and it ripped in several spots. I think it should have lasted a lot longer, especial since the weather here (SF Bay) is pretty mild all year."
3,Puddled Patio Table & 4 chair cover All in one,The price is excellent. It covers our round patio table & 4 chairs together. The only downfall is the water and leaves collect and make a mess on the top when it rains because of no slope or drain for runoff. Bummer!
2,Fell apart,This table cover lasted a little less than one year before it disintegrated. We are in S. California so the elements are not that harsh but when you touch the cover it now comes apart in your hands. We have had covers from Walmart that lasted better.
1,Horrible Durability,"When I first opened this product I thought, ""wow, this seems like a sturdy cover, well-built, and should last for quite some time."" I was poorly mistaken. I live in MN, so we have cold and snowy winters. After 1 winter, this cover is totally worthless. Extremely brittle, tears everywhere, the cover is now like a piece of paper that tears anytime it's moved. I have nice patio furniture and seek to protect it from the elements. Covers are supposed to do that, so I found it extremely disapointing to not even get 1 year out of this. Definitely would not recommend, am looking for something more expensive that will hold up better."
2,Measurements/description deceiving,Disappointed with this cover - like most covers I've tried - this one is no different as it will not cover the table AND chairs together. I have taller backs on our chairs and even though the measurements seemed like it should fit - it simply doesn't. Kinda looks like a full size contour sheet trying to fit on a queen mattress!! Not even close! The quality of the product appears to be good but unfortunately I'll never know how it holds up. I doubt there is any cover that will work well with this size set. Missed the return window too so now I own it!! :(
1,Not worth the money,"We purchased several of these to cover all our patio furniture. The covers in this line look great. However, after one year's use, they have holes, small and large all over. They no longer are of use for what they were purchased for. They don't go to the ground and fit snuggly (I have all sizes). Don't purchase them to keep the yellow pine pollen off the furniture...that doesn't work at all. It would be cheaper to leave my furniture out in the elements and replace it every four or five years than to purchase these yearly (which is what is necessary if you are trying to keep rain, snow, ice off)."
2,You get what you pay for,This cover lasted just over year before it started self destructing. The fabric has become so weak that just grabbing the cover with my bare hand causes it to tear.
2,Lasted 1 year ONLY!,"I've had two of these same covers for about 1 year, bought them at the same time, they are now ripping and starting to tear when I put them on and off. Bottom line, the warranty was limited, although the descriptions says 'years of enjoyment', which might be true if I used it inside (kidding). This is clearly an outside cover, which can't handle the elements for too long. I live in CA, so the only weather this encountered, aside from infrequent rain, is sun. The sun must be cryptonite for these covers, because it is DONE. Sad to say, but this proved to be a 1 year option for me, very dissapointed."
2,Not for the long haul,We purchased this in January 2011 and already there are 2 rips in it. We will need to purchase a replacement one. The material is medium weight- thought it would last longer than 1 3/4 years.
1,Only lasted 18 months,"After only a year and a half it is ripped in multiple places. Our NorCal climate is very mild, so this is a big disappointment. Can't find manufacturers website to complain."
5,great quality,When I received it I was very happy with the quality of the cover. It's not cheap looking or lightweight. It fit perfect over my patio table and 4 chairs which are big.
2,Very disappointed - has fallen apart in 8 months,"This cover was purchased in March 2011 and used in Los Angeles to cover a table and 4 chairs. It has been removed maybe 3 times. It is November 2011 and the fabric has deteriorated to where you can puncture it by gently pressing your finger against it. It is a heavy material and initially was very strong, but obviously has little or no UV protection. I have a grill cover that is over 15 years old and still going strong. I only wish I could find a table cover of the same quality. If anybody can recommend one, please comment."
2,On a downward spiral,"When I was looking for a new series to read, Stardoc caught my attention. The story of a juniour doctor escaping 'her father' by fleeing offworld seemed ineresting. Ive since gone through the series and the books have steadily gotten worse and worse.The problem is quite frankly the plot. The basic idea is ok but the fault with this book, is that Cherijo is too....perfect. She always does the right thing, no matter how improble the choise. She is up against a mad scientist, an evil game, a backwards community and an incompetant doctor. None have any redeeming features at all.I just can't handle it because I can't see anyone being so perfect in a saddistic world like this.The only reason that I carried on reading is because it is an unusual take on the world. Every other book has the human race as the good guys and are loved by all others.I am thinking VERY hard about whether I will get the next one."
3,"Solid, but a bit underwhelming","This entry in the Stardoc series plods a bit. Since for most of the storyline Cherijo & Duncan are out of reach from there friends (again!) and the new characters seem very contrived, it doesn't grab your attention like the stories with the Joren's do, for example. And then it ends in a most irksome fashion, with very little actually being accomplished in the the middle 400 pages of the book and all of the major plot developments in the first and last 20 pages.On the other hand, Ms. Viehl can write, and the dialogue is snappy. So the ride, though somewhat empty, is nonetheless enjoyable."
2,skip this one,"Ok here's what you do.Go to the local book store, get a copy of this useless book and read the first couple of chapters and the last few. As long as you forget about the rest of this waste of paper the Stardoc series as a whole will still hold a high place in your memory."
2,If angst is what you're going for...,"Let me start with the fact that I loved the first Stardoc Novel. The next was good, but less so. The same with the next and now we get to Shockball. For a scifi book, there is a startling lack of your typical space saga while human alien hybrids and a fictional sport seem to be the only reminders that the book is set in the future. Cherijo manages to find a disease that has long since been extinct, which of course means it is a current day disease.I liked Reever the best in this novel compared to the other three books, however, that was not enough to save the book from overall repetitive storytelling. I personally have had enough of the angst. We get it, Chreijo has a awesome immune system so can be tortured and recover. It seems all that happened in the last book was that she was tortured and then escaped. The same happens here.The characters have potential, but instead we are treated to the soap opera angsty life of Cherijo."
2,Second favorite from the trilogy ...,"I liked this book second out of the three. I liked that Maggie was actually someone I could picture in my head and at times, be like. Very easy reading as always, but with a nice twist here and there."
4,Nora at her best,Born in Fire begins a wonderful trilogy with rich characters and descriptions of the Irish landscape. The inclusion of myths and fairies adds a great whimsical aspect to the storyline. They balance out some of the traits of the characters. Nora Roberts brings it all together beautifully.
4,GLASS ARTIST,BOOK ONE OF A TRILOGY. THREE DAUGHTERS DIFFERENT AS CAN BE. THIS DAUGHTER MAKES GLASS ART. THE HERO WANTS A CONTRACT TO OWN ALL HER WORKS. SHE HAS A TEMPER I ADMIRE AND GUTS TO GO WITH IT. THIS BOOK WAS A TRUE DELIGHT
4,couldn't put it down!!,it was exciting. i imagine myself in Clare with them. it was funny but romanic! Nora Roberts does it again with this book. A Must Read!!
5,Maggie...,"After finishing the last book in the ""Born In.."" series I felt like I was saying goodbye to long lost friends. This rarely happens for me because I read so much, but Nora introduced me to the best of people and the best of traditions. I may not read for a couple of days and those who know me will be shocked because I am rarely seen without a book in my hand or a book on the fireplace calling my name. I feel I should mourn the loss of never again getting to read for the first time this ""Born In..."" series. If you have never read any of Nora's books please just pick one up. Yes as we all know there are a number of wonderful authors out in the big ole' world of books, but there are only a few who can ever dream of being as good as Nora! Bravo for this series!"
4,a terrific book,"loved the setting of this story as much as the story itself. because of nora roberts and her books, ive grown to love stories set with the irish. to be able to read the words and hear that accent is to me truly amazing.maggie is the oldest child having been raised in a home with no family love. she is close to her father and sister, but her mother is a different person all together. because of this lack of love from her, maggie is determined to make something of herself if only to prove her mother wrong. breaking the outer shell shes developed as a form of protection wont be easy, but rogan intends to do just that.a lovely story with enough mystery to leave the reader hoping they have their copy of born in ice sitting nearby once they close the last page of this one ::smile"
1,Waste of a read!,"I was given this and Born in Ice by my mother in law, who thought I would enjoy reading novels set in Ireland, where I am from - I cringed through reading this book, the use of dialect was nothing more than Shakespearean Irish - if Nora Roberts actually visited Ireland, I would like to know where she found the characters that actually spoke like this at all - it was an infuriating mix of the country woman, Maggie, speaking old Irish and the main love interest, Rogan, speaking as Irish people speak today. The storyline was a good premise for a novel of glass artist Maggie meeting up with city art dealer Rogan, however, if you are going to write about a country that is not your native own, steer away from the stereotypical tourist imagery and be realistic. Needless to say, I did not bother reading Born in Ice and both copies went to a Salvation Army store."
1,NGC Controller rip off...,"I found out today, too late I guess, that this controller doesn't even work. Not only did I have to wait 6 months to get the product, but when I finally do, it's delivered inoperable. I'll never buy from you again!"
2,NOT SO MUCH,"I BOUGHT THIS FOR MY SON, HE LOVED IT BUT IT ONLY LASTED ABOUT 2 WEEKS THEN EVERYTHING STARTED TO BREAK DOWN ON IT. WE HAD TO BUY A REPLACEMENT."
3,Glowing is cool but . . .,"This controller is awesome b/c it lights up, however, one of the lights stopped working a couple weeks after it arrived. I'm not overly impressed with the quality."
3,it's alright,"Danger Doom is alright... nothing too exciting... I thought it would be more up beat but it turned out being a lot more ""in your face""... but I'm also not that much into hip-hop."
4,Refreshingly clever and creative,"These days with so many MC's spouting lyrics about being hard and how they run the streets, it is nice to hear an album that is both fun and infectious. If you are a MF DOOM fan, this album is right up your alley! DOOM's knack for lazy and sly lyrical delivery coupled with Danger Mouses obvious gift for production creates an album that has become an instant classic in many circles. Although knowing the Adult Swim characters helps flush out some of the tracks, it is not needed to enjoy it.This album may not be for everyone, and if Rap and Hip Hop to you is about aggressive bragging or so called 'street cred' then buy your self another 50 cent album and call it a day. If you are looking for something different in the tradition of Kool Keith's creativly themed albums, this is a great buy and possibly a good intro to MF DOOM. Let's hope for more colaborations that manifest them selves in this manner!"
3,Sorta disillusioned. not happy. there were some good tracks,"Hip-Hop making fun of Hip-hop does not impress me. This album was supposed to be produced rather quickly, I can tell. But hell it's sold alot so it's good right??? The two previous releases mmm food and danger doom seem to be less thought out than Madvillan which bumped from beginning to end (thanks madlib). I really liked Viktor Vaughn - Vaudeville Villan, But the new doom cds, this one, and mmm food seemed like he was slow with his rhymes and the beats were not as refined. dig deeper into the doom, you could do better."
3,It's alright,"I know MF Doom is capable of much more. Danger Mouse, I'm not so sure. And what's the deal with the album being edited? I hate that!"
3,Ehh....,"Obviously checked this one out after it's Adult Swim airtime. Unfortunatly I couldn't realy get into MF Dooms style or lyrics. He didn't have anything to say that realy blew me away, and he has a monotone voice that didn't realy move me in any way. On the other hand I realy liked Danger Mouse's beats. If he'd have paired up with a mc with a little more emotion they might have had a real winner here...."
2,I was a little disappointed,"After hearing Danger Mouse's other production credits and works I was disappointed in this album. The beats and rhymes both were basic and nothing I heard really got me moving. MF Doom's raps are cheeky in that pre-schooler kinda way. Kinda weak. Andy Milinokis flows better than this cat. I like Aqua Teen, but having them on the album made me feel like I was listenning to an album on ""my first record player"" back in the Fischer Price days. Skip this one. My copy will be on Ebay here soon, so look for it."
2,"Beats, but no lyrics!","I dont know why everyone is writing so much about this. What it comes down to is, the beats are amazing but Doom's lyrics and voice are terrible! He sounds like hes tired whenever hes rappin. And i dont think hes rapping about ANYTHING! He just says whatever rhymes. heres a direct quote from track 2 called ""sofa king"".""Got y'all but it's not all bare and skittlesPrepare the viddles, got riddles and spittlesCrystal clear to the jock or the tittleTSSSS.. It's hot off the griddleCame to take the cake wether it's a lot or a little""What does that mean?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?! he raps about nothing and trys to hide it by starting and ending the""rhyme"" with something about adult swim cartoons.Does he freestlye? Because there are alot of pauses that sound like he didnt come with lyrics beforehand.so if you don't mind what are possibly the worst lyrics ever written, rapped by possibly the worst rapper of all time, then go ahead, buy the album and enjoy the beats."
5,Album of the year,"MF Doom, Dangermouse, Adult Swim Theme...what more do you want? This album is damn near perfect and anyone who says otherwise is sofa king wetarded."
5,Dooms best,"I can't say enough about Doom. I'm not even a casual rap fan and I love this album & just about every single other one he puts out. Buy this and your commute,workout, and day in general will be better. Solid buy"
4,Nice!,"Very good hip hop. Great old-school boom-bap beats, smart writing, and MF Doom's smooth, understated delivery make this one of the better hip-hop albums I've heard in a long time. I especially like 5,9,12,13,and 14."
4,Fun album,"Mouse and the Mask is a fun, quirky and catchy album. As an Adult Swim, MF Doom and Danger Mouse fan, it was a welcome addition to my music library. Non-fans might feel otherwise, however. My guess, if you like Cartoon Network's Adult Swim lineup, you will also enjoy this album."
4,Danger Mouse Super Producer?,"One must admit that our man DJ Danger Mouse has some serious skills in producing dope hip-hop beats. I hear people talk about ""The Grey Album"", where DJ DM mixed Jay-Z rhymes over beatles beats, not mentioning his 5+ star effort together with Jemini on the ""Ghetto Pop Life"" joint. Trust me, this CD is da bomb.Now, finally Danger Mouse has made it. It's not only the new Gorillaz CD ""Demon Days"" and the now heavily rotating Gnarls Barkley project ""St. Elsewhere"", but especially this underground joint together with MF Doom that put DJ DM on the map. This record is hillarious, witty and packed with great rap and dope beats.For those who don't believe me check out ""Benzie Box"", ""Old School"" and ""Space Ho's"". This CD deserves it's 4.5 stars! Don't hesitate to purchase!"
4,kick ass album,"I bought this disk as I am a fan of the Adult swim shows, but I wasn't sure what to expect.It's great, simple basic rap with well placed cameos from the characters.A.T.H.F. & Vats of Urine have been playing on my system for days."
4,Fantastic Beats,"I was a little skeptical when I purchased this album, not being all that fond of the only track I had heard MF Doom rap on, ""November Has Come"" by Gorillaz, but I gave it a chance.Danger Mouse really shines on this album, making every track completely fresh and funky. MF Doom even grew on me, though, among my favorites would have to be Old School, with Talib Kweli, and Benzi Box, with Cee-Lo. However, the whole album is spectacular really. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is the bleeping of profanity. I feel that the content on the album is more adult oriented, as is the subject matter from which it took its inspiration, and as such, I feel that the bleeping was unnecessary.Great album, though, Doom, Danger, and all the others really took me by surprise, and it ended up that this album was far better than expected."
4,"Good, not great","I love Doom, and I love Dangermouse. The album is very good overall with some really great tracks. It doesn't get 5 stars because I don't like Doom as much in this much of a cartoon form. I prefer his raw, supervillain persona of Madvillainy (best album of the 2000s) and Operation Doomsday. At the same time it's fresh to hear Doom in some songs with choruses. Just different, and not quite his best."
1,sssshnitza pleaseeeeeeee,"Buuuuuuuuu, same monotonous babble over and over again with different background music ripped from god knows where and WHY!? Put any music for the background in your favorite kareoke machine and then babble anything incoherent to this tone:nepenepene nepenepene over and OVERRRRRR!!! I have just described what this talentless fest sounds like(not to mention most c/rap albums out there). Don't take my word for it, try the sound clips and judge yourself, and if you're one of the few that has brain cells still beating around in your gourd(unless dope and mass hypnosis have done their toll like most others who love dis' type o ""music"") you'll sees what I means ""dog"". Yo!"
1,What amounts to a defense of genecidal regimes...,"Corwin pens a defense of genocidal regimes cloaked in an attack on imperialism and the West, continuing to spread a false representation of the facts on the ground - that all three sides are equally to blame - instead of focusing on the verbatim strategy of ethnic cleansing and genocide on the side of Serbian aggressors. No, as a previous reviewer mentioned, he categorically misses the point as he touts his case despite the glaring evidence to the contrary. In short, an unapologetic piece of propaganda that should be as vehemently condemned as the crimes it actively ignores."
1,Wrong,"It was only because of military intervention in Bosnia that the war finally ended. The fact that war ended had nothing to do with the UN's humanitarian mission, from the start a disgrace and a failure. It is amazing how hard it is to find UN personel willing to admit their policy, prior to military intervention, was disastrous. This year finally, the Secretary General, in a report framed by the massacre of Srebrenica, did admit the UN's total failure."
5,Ernest is the greatest!,We have had Ernest movies for thirty years. Our children grew up loving his goofey antics and now our grandchildren are loving him. Somewhere along the way we missed this one. I found it at Amazon and gave it to my husband for father's day. He's an avid Ernest fan. He was so excited he had a come to Grandpa's house for pop corn and a movie. In this day of reality its fun to just sit back and laugh through a good movie.
2,ANOTHER LOW POINT OF THE SERIES,"THIS TIME, ERNEST [JIM VARNEY] MUST PROTECT A RARE TREASURE. THIS IS NOT A VERY ENTERTAINING MOVIE AND IT'S STILL THE ONLY ERNEST MOVIE THAT DOESN'T HAVE A DVD VERSION TO IT. ANYWAY, FANS OF THE SERIES SHOULD HAVE NO PROBLEM LIKING IT. BUT OTHERS SHOULDN'T EVEN WASTE THE TIME TO WATCH IT. FOLLOWED BY ERNEST GOES TO SCHOOL."
1,could be better,"This video really is a waste of time. Basically, it's a couple hours of photographs of Iceland on videotape. What is the point? Why not just get a guide book? The pictures would be better quality. Please don't waste your money."
2,Unappetizing,"I like Claudia Dain and her other books. This book was too focused on her period, which occurs for 330 out of 390 pages.So obviously nothing happens for that entire time. As well,the entire concept of having relations during one's period is very unappealing, and not worth buying a book to read about that possibly happening.Plus, the heroine is a shrew, never softening towards Hugh, or making peace with her world, as she tells herself she will and must. Hugh is too easily forgiven for lying through his teeth, although he comes to care for her more readily and honestly than she does for him. Skip this book and try another one of Ms. Dain's."
1,Depressing,I can understand Ms. Dain's trying to explain how hard women really had it back then with the period situation (which took up too much of the story ) and the childbirthing deaths not to mention no rights on what they did with their lives. The book covers a lot of subjects that were very depressing with not enough humor or romance to get over the sad parts. I don't know why Ms. Dain made the book so sad. But I still think she's a good writer. I've read other books by her so maybe she was just showing the dark side of living back then.
1,Some Books Aren't Worth Finishing,"It's not that I expect literature from my romance. God knows truely wonderful writers are few and far between. And I appreciate charecter developement, however, I do not want to read a romance where one of the major plot points is a women's period. I do NOT find it romantic or chiverous of a man to insist that his wife does not have the privacy to change her medieval pad. These scenes were GREAT charecter developement scenes; however, they revealed charecters that I do not care to know."
1,Zero stars is more like it!,This so called romance novel is nothing but 300 pages of a girl having her period and whining. Read only if you want to lose your lunch. The last chapter they finally have sex but then find out she was child molested. How does this ever get on the romance book list? Disappointment and waste of six bucks
3,"This book holds some ""taboo"" subjects, however.....","I enjoyed reading this book. Although the book goes on about the girl's menstrual cycle, the way it was used, to me, was not so much disgusting as... well, I'm not sure how to describe it.This girl's struggle to remain grounded in her ideals of faith and religion, and be submissive to what the historical period's idea of how she was to act made it a good read.In today's society, the way this girl is treated would be an outrage. Its an outrage that women were treated this way in any age, but she comes through it like a champ.I recommend it."
5,A Good Medieval,This book is a battle of wills between the Elsbeth and Hugh and will keep you cheering for both up until the end. The 12th century is vividly recaptured in The Temptation and a must read.
5,Overwheming Temptation,"Unbelievable sexual tension between a submissive girl and a true gentleman leaves you wanting more with every turn of the page. Hugh of Jerusalem is every woman's dream of seduction and fulfillment. His character is so strong and sensuous that he becomes addicting to the reader as well as Elsbeth, his naive and untrusting bride. The book is 388 pages of pure seduction. Dain offers great insight to the beliefs and practices of the time period (England, 1156). To anyone who finds the book distasteful or vulgar, they must remember the realities of history. It takes true talent to turn such a dark and dreary time to pure seduction and fantasy."
1,One Word... ICK.....,"I have been reading romance novels for years and this has got to be the absolute worst ""Wallbanger"" I have ever run across! This was the worst waste of paper I have ever seen. Ms Dain what were you thinking? 300 pages of bloody female cycles. Yuck.... This is romantic???"
1,A disapointment!,"I waited several months for this book and I was so disapointed! The story would have been really good if it had been written differently then what it was. The story had great potential if the writer had not used most of the story on the heroine's problem, which was her monthly ministration. I got tired of reading about that over and over again. The writer wrote more about the heroines period and forgot about the main meat of the story. There is only so much you can read about a woman's period and how it affects the couples relationship before it gets monotonous."
1,"Mentrual fetish 5, Love 0","This book should be required reading for every preteen before she gets her period. After reading it she'll know exactly what to expect. The writer has a definite gift for making the reader feel a part of the action...her colorful, in depth hundreds of pages description puts you right there in the room with the heroine. Except that this is supposed to be a love novel. Lacking the writer's gift for colorful adjectives I can only say...ugh."
3,"Nice looking, but...","I have had these bulbs in my 1992 Corsica for about 2 years now. I have tried almost every bulb out there to give that HID blue look and these are by far, the best. One thing I do like about them, is that they have lasted me for 2 years and are still working, unlike other bulbs which die out in less then a year.But there is one flaw and it's a biggie. Even though they look cool, they are a dim looking bulb. They are great for show or driving in the city where everything is lit up with street lights, but if you have to drive in the country or a dark street, you can't see very well with these bulbs. They have never been a bright bulb.So if you want that blue look and want bulbs that last, these are your guys, but if you want to be able to see at night while you drive, stay away from these :)"
1,Book in Chinese and English.,This book was written in both Chinese and English. I threw it away immediately as it was WAY TOO CONFUSING for our daughter to try to read. I would have liked to have known that this book was written in two different languages before I purchased it.
2,"The price is right, but....","I bought this dish about 6 months ago and use it on a regular basis. However, when baking some fish at moderate oven temperature (375), it split into two separate pieces with a loud ""crack""; there was no extreme temperature changes either.Go figure."
3,Where have the voices gone,"This recording might be better appreciated if you've never heard the original with Steber,Elias,Gedda and Tozzi. Those singers on the old recording were all major opera stars who connected with their roles and listeners. The vocal balance is further back on the new recording giving more prominence to the excellent Ukraine Orchestra. The orchestral passages are played beautifully. Ellen Chickering has some good moments as Vanessa even if she occasionally sounds like she's singing Salome or Elektra. Richard Conrad is an old tenor pushing his voice down to sing the bass role of the Doctor which was so beautifully sung by Tozzi before. Ray Bauwens sings Anatol with an unattractive though strong voice. Andrea Matthews' Erika is a little on the wobbly side. Still, its nice to have a new recording of this fine opera even if it doesn't feature any great voices."
2,Annoying,"Ok, the music is great and sounds as good or better than I expected...BUT the concert footage is poorly remastered! The audio track does NOT match the video. Phil sings, and then his vocals arrive a 'touch' later. Arrrgh! This is the same annoying problem I have with the concert footage on the enhanced ""A Trick of the Tail"" CD/DVD (Glasgow '76). The audio track on that show does not match the video.Oddly enough, the interview portions of both DVD's are just fine. Also, I own the VHS of that 1976 TToT Glasgow show, and the soundtrack is perfect. It's only the concert footage on those DVD's that are out of sync. Is it just me? Anyone else have that issue? Comments? Help?"
3,swishhhhhhhhhhhhhhh,your all correct theres maximum compression this engineer was a idiot this was not the way GENESIS should have been remixed...the originals are beautiful organic ...just pure ...the whole catalog sounds like this...what was the purpose ...remixing when done in this day and age can be heavenly but this a incorrect mix...but...but when my ears adjust to it it's ...interesting
4,The best one so far...,"Other than one chapter, this book was great. Very hard to put down. It's got everything a good sci-fi should have. The creation of the Priest-kings is Norman's best work. Incredible detail makes them believeable. The only chapter that went on too long was Tarl putting Vika in safe keeping (I think Chap 26) in the plastic cage. other than that chapter, the book was darn near perfect.His writing is MUCH better than the first book. There's a lot going on in this book so you find yourself reading as fast as possible to see what happens. Take your time, read it slowly, and enjoy some of the best science fiction I've ever read."
3,The Priest-Kings of Gor,"I thought the book was good as it provided additional information on Tarl Cabot's background and history, and about the Priest-Kings, but at times it went into a bit too much technical detail.I enjoyed reading it as I want to follow the continuing adventures of Tarl on Gor. I liked the end as it sets up the story for then next novel, ""The Nomads of Gor."""
2,Not Free SF Reader,"In a brutal world, it would not surprise you that guys called the Priest-Kings were in charge, would it? Right, didn't think so.If they wanted to take your women, lunch money, clothes, booze, food, or your dog, they would. Tarl Cabot has suffered the first one on the list, and goes looking for answers, hoping not to die."
3,Priest-Kings of Gor,"This is the best writing Norman has done so far in the Gorean series.I find the dwelling on female slavery tiring. Every female is to die for, everyone of them learns to just love being his slave.This book had enough action to keep me interested. Hopefully he is growing as a writer as the series progresses."
5,Terrific Skillet,This is a replacement skillet for a similar skillet I purchased. It is just the right size for breakfast and one we use a lot. Easy to clean and lightweight enough for my wife to use as well.
5,Great all purpose pan.,"This has been an excellent pan. Durable, easy to clean and a good size for many different types of meals."
3,Men in black,hi im gustavs son robin this men in black cd isnt very great its got some good songs on it but its not that great
5,Brill,"I can honestly say the Electric Soft Parade are by far one of my favourite bands of all time. The first album was absolutely amazing, and the second soon to be relased shall also be"
4,Hang in there!,"I am a huge Blackie Ryan fan, and have read just about every book in the series. My advice to readers of _Happy are the Merciful_ is to hang in there through the first half of the novel. It is not told from Blackie's point of view, but from that of an idealistic young district attorney. I actually gave up on this book about halfway into the D.A.'s narrative, because, though well-written, it just wasn't giving me the ""Blackie fix"" I crave in one of Greeley's novels. It turns out that the information provided in the D.A.'s narrative is information vital for the reader to fully comprehend the case once Blackie steps in. Without it, the story would just not work. Once you reach the portion of the novel where the narrative switches over to Fr. Blackie, you will NOT be disappointed! I am so glad I went back to this book, and would encourage Blackie fans to keep the faith."
5,Insightful good reading,"Like the many other Andrew M. Greeley books, the focus is on the qualities and interaction of a few people. The mystery element is deftly handled. Father Greeley's unique perspective gives this subseries from the Sermon on the Mount a special flavor which makes the reader think."
5,Miracle on 34th street,Has always been one of my favorite but it's so good to share with friends and family. A really warm and fuzz felling movie. The Santa is beautiful and all the innocents is so welcoming.
5,Great Blu Ray,"The visual quality is excellent! I wasn't sure how it would be since it's an older movie, but it is great!"
4,Nice,I loved the original but I thought they did a good job with this one. The acting was great and the movie believable. Had the video for a while and was upgrading to a DVD.
3,MIRACLE ON 34TH STREET,I DIDN'T LIKE IT AS I WANTED FULL SCREEN LIKE THEY HAVE IT ON VHS TAPE. I DON'T LIKE WIDE SCREEN ON ANY MOVIE ALLEN
2,Shameful,"This remake was an insult to the original classic. The writing borrows extensively from George Seaton's nearly perfect 1947 screenplay, but discards some of the brilliant plot devices and completely omits one of the key moments which we all remember fondly. The scenes replacing them are nowhere near as clever or heartwarming. In fact this film turns very nasty and dark when it comes to the moment in the plot where Kris is framed and sent to the asylum accused of being crazy and a violent offender. The way the Original film dealt with it was sheer genious and not a bit ugly or offensive. The actors in the principal roles are the only lights flashing anywhere on this dim and dreary Christmas tree."
2,Christmas film,I ordered another video from some one else further away and got it before christmas. I received this one two weeks after. But it was in good condition will enjoy this coming christmas.
1,A decidedly inferior remake.,"The 1947 Miracle on 34th Street is probably the best Christmas movie ever. This remake tries hard, way too hard, in fact, but is utterly devoid of the charm and wit of the original, and adds a bit of sleaze just for good measure. It also misses one of the central points of both the book and the original movie, the very carefully unresolved ambiguity about whether the central character is actually Santa Claus, or merely a slightly crazy old man. Not worth the time to watch, much less the money to buy. Get the original."
1,Horrible Remake,I believe this is the worst remake ever made! It doesn't deserve the name! The original movie was about a little girl who didn't know any fairy tales. She didn't mind because she didn't know any better.In the new movie she seems like an abused child! That is only one of the things wrong with the feel and look of this horrible thing. The cuteness of the original is completely lost in this movie. I really really hated it. All the fun and sweetness of the original is completely missing in this one. What a shame this movie was ever made. I feel sorry for people that see this movie first (or at all) before seeing the orginal!I gave it one star because I didn't have the option to give it multiple negative stars!
5,Will Do Business Again!,The transaction went without a hitch and I was well pleased and able to enjoy the dvd in plenty of time for Christmas. Thank you so much!
3,Pretty enjoyable film...,Try to enter into the spirit of the movie and don't constantly compare it to the fantastic original movie. You'll enjoy it then on its own merits.
5,Miracle on 34th Street (Remake),Product just as described... Christmas wouldn't be Christmas without watching this classic story. The remake is a perfect adaptation according to its modern times without taking away the sparkle from the original.
5,What a Great Holiday Movie!,We had this movie in Video and have watched it every Thanksgiving for years. Now we will have it in DVD to enjoy for many more years. The acting is so good and the ending is great.
5,Miracle on 34th Street,"This is a wonderful Christmas movie for the whole family! It's tough to say which is better, this one or the original Miracle on 34th Street. The stories are a bit different, but just as magical!"
2,too cutesy,"The original had charm, a story, and a believable Susan, lacking in the ""update"". How ironic to justify Santa Claus by referencing a dollar bill. Kris Kringle cringed!"
4,As good as I remember,I loved the original and this one is close second! The people in this do a great job of honoring the original.
3,This Remake is Okay But It Lacks The Warmth Of The Original.,"I love the original Miracle on 34th Street movie and this remake has it's moments and has a very good cast, Richard Attenborough, Dylan McDermott, Elizabeth Perkins and Mara Wilson but it can't hold a candle to the original black and white version and lacks the warmth of that old classic. The actors were fine, it was the atmosphere of the movie that I found kind of cold and lacking of charm compared to the original version!"
1,nothing like the origanal,i saw this version way before the origanal and liked it. then i saw the origanal and loved it and was crazy about it. then realized that this 1994 remake is horrable.so don't buy this version for your kids instead buy the one with moureen o'hara and natalie wood
1,Miracle On 34th Street,"Some classics should not be re-done. This version added nothing but color. Without the actors who we grew up seeing and appreciating, it is a poor attempt to make money off a sweet story."
1,Miracle on 34th Street,Received a wrong product. My money was refunded without a problem. Still would like to have the version I wanted....I'll reorder it from a different vendor.
2,So Bad So Bad,"Sometimes I like remakes but this one was so bad. I am 16 years old and was brought up on the orignal black and white version. And that was a great family classic. But this movie was so bad. Why, Why remake a classic !!"
2,A TERRIBLE AND UNNECESSARY REMAKE...,"First things first...why even bother to remake such a great movie. Oh, I know, it was remade in the 1970's with sebastian Cabot in a made for TV movie, but still. This is a classic that will always stand on its own.You will never be able to surpass the original, the bar is too high. You know the story...a man who looks like Santa is hired to play Jolly Ol' St. Nick at a department store and then gets into trouble when he insists he's the real deal.Unfortunately, this movie has none of the warmth, charm, humor, or magick of the original. The actors all seem to be sleep walking, the little girl playing the Natalie Wood role is annoying, and the courtroom sequence and ending is devoid of the magic that made you wonder if there really is a Santa.Skip this and stick with the original"
2,this might be cute if you haven't seen the original,"a bit of fluff for the holiday season, but nothing much compared to the original. Edmund Gwenn WAS Santa Claus, and his charm, and the charm of the supporting actors in the original film far surpass this bit of Hollywood handiwork. Certainly no harm in this film, but I'll not be watching it again."
5,Favorite Holiday Classic!,"This is my favorite holiday movie! The little girl is adorable, and the whole show will melt your heart like butter. I have to say that I don't remember the original, but I'm a sucker for color! And this movie definitely has that, from the humor to the sparkle in the little girl's eyes. Love, Love, Love this movie! It's a gem!"
4,Fantastic,The movie is great. The purchase process was simple and the delivery was quick. We enjoy watching the movie with our family every Christmas and sometimes throughout the year. Pleased.
3,"great movie, but didn't work with airplay on my apply tv! should have got it on itunes.","5 stars for the movie, one star because I ordered it in part to watch it on my iPad through the Amazon instant video app and it wouldn't work with my airplay and apple TV... no video showed, only sound. please fix this amazon."
1,Not a miracle,"I am a huge fan of the original movie, so didn't have hopes for this remake. The saddest part is that they changed the reason for Santa Claus being acquitted. Instead of the cute, wonderful approach of the post office delivering the mail, it had to have a religious reason instead. Too bad."
2,Too juvenile and predictable for my taste,"Cinematography was excellent as was the acting. I didn't think the story line was that interesting, though. Maybe the villain's character should have been better developed."
5,Love this movie!,I finally decided to own this movie so I would have it available every Christmas! It was shipped very fast!
5,Classic,"I remember this movie from growing up, but couldn't find it in a store anywhere. Great price for a great classic film."
3,"Not the classic, but watchable.","For many, the original, starring Edmund Gwen and Natalie Wood, is the ONLY version. I see their point. But this remake is no total waste of time. I found it quite entertaining. It's best points are Mara Wilson's Susan and Sir Richard Attenborough in the central role. If he's not the real Santa Claus, he ought to be."
4,Good Old-Fashioned Christmas Movie!,"My family really enjoys this great remake of an older version. The actors are great, the scenery/decorations are truly delightful. It tells a good hearted story that makes you feel good about Christmas, and know that there are still a lot of good people in this world."
5,Miracle on 34th street,This is one of the best movies especially at Christmas. Miracle on 34th street is one of my favorites. also like the other Miracle On 34th Street.
5,Miracle on 34th street,This is one of the best Christmas movies ever...The scene where Santa talks to a cute little girl using sign language is beautiful and always brings tears to my eyes.
5,Great remake,"This had enough differences from the original version to make it worthwhile, and I especially liked the logic of the slightly altered climax. All the acting is fine, but Mara Wilson is completely wonderful."
5,LOVE it,"We adore this movie. The Santa (Kris Kringle) is such a convincing actor, you may be on the lookout for the Santa man himself!"
5,feel good movie,"Ordered this to replace the VHS version we had from years back, it's still fun to watch!"
5,Miracle on 34th Street (Remake),"Order was recieved within a few days (4) I was shocked and happy. Although, this DVD was used, it is in perfect condition. Thanks for the excellent service!!Movie~BuffErin L.Monroe, Ga"
1,thorough,I have seen this film to be: primitive interisting in the beginning but boring in the end based on an ordinary story
3,Gave it away...,"When I recieved the backpack, the inside of the bag was not the material shown on the ad. The bag seemed nice enough, but the print inside looked like something for a 12 year old girl... so I gave it to one. She was pleased. I like purple so I was looking forward to the purple interior. They told me I could return it - but I didn't make it to the post office in time, so the purchase became a gfit."
4,great but not for sensitive kids,"I just finished reading this book to my almost 7 year old who is homeschooled. It is very well written, great literature, lots of information about chickens and their behavior, good social studies and would be a great read aloud for someone studying chickens and eggs and all that good stuff. I really wanted to post a review for the book and give a little warning to parents who might have sensitive children, that there are some graphic parts to the book which I was not expecting. I had to do some serious editing and skipping of paragraphs so as not to upset my daughter. Mauling, thrashings, toes falling off, chickens hanging themselves etc. It has a very sweet heart but it may not be for animal loving sensitive children."
5,An Annual TREAT at our House!,This year will be my 10th year reading this book outloud at the dining room table! It should be mandatory reading for every 6 grade girl (they can be kind of mean at times!) My children beg for this yearly tradition! It is a great reminder about the acceptance of difference and always sparks many conversations around the table! I hope you'll take the time to enjoy this classic! His other books are favorites as well.
5,De Jong/Sendak perfect match!,"I love all kind of animals and above all dogs, I read three times Along Came a Dog and Hurry Home Candy, and each time I felt the same tension at the beginning and the same triumph at the end of this moving story. The simplicity and the reality of the description of situations and emotions is amazing as extraordinary is the match De Jong /Sendak.As a foreigner reader (Italian) I think these two artists keep at the very top the quality of American children's literature and arts.An inspiration for beginners and professionals writers and illustrators!I wish Amazon had a ten star rating!"
1,Really Boring,"This book may fit what adults think nine and twelve year olds should be reading, but I read this when I was nine and even then my reaction was, ""this is not well written."" C'mon people, I was nine when I said that. This book is utterly boring, and there never is a real point of the story. Something adults like about it the kids are missing, so whats the point?AN AWARD ON THIS BOOK!?!?!?!"
1,BOOOOOOOOORRRRRRRIIIIIIIINNNNNNGGGG!!!!!,"It was an okay story, the plot and stuff, but it was boring!!! I would NOT recommend it unless you like boring stories! The story went nowhere, De Jong stayed on the same thing WAAAAAAY too long.TWO THUMBS DOWN!!! I WISH THEY HAD A ZERO STAR RATING!!!"
5,Episodes,"This show,talking as a Brit,makes one wonder what really goes on in the ""Dream Factory""Its ""up there""with the ""Office""as one of the best Anglo/American TransfersCongratulations to all concerned"
2,Not very funny,"Nope, not very funny thing. Out of 7 episodes only one was really funny. Other than that - waste of time. And Joye is not very adorable. Nothing compare to ""Friends""."
4,Too Short,"I don't know if it's because I was so enthralled and having so much fun watching this video, but it was a lot shorter than I expected (72 minutes) The bulk of the DVD was spent on Sven's preparation for the Iditarod (previous races and training) but there was very little footage of the Iditarod itself. I certainly don't expect the camera to stay with him for 1049 miles, but I would hope that the photographer would have spent the effort to film him at checkpoints and the finish line at the very least and thus spend more time on a Rookie's Journey to Nome.However, as a progressing musher, I thoroughly enjoyed what we did get to see, and to see the varying methods used by each musher. I struggled with 3 or 4 stars because for $20 it was less than I expected. However, I'll stick with 4 stars just because I enjoyed the content, and certainly support the effort that was made."
1,More a home video than a documentary,Was expecting a documentary but it turned out to be a home video with slides. didnt watch far enough in to find out if they actually filmed the guy while he was racing instead of just when he showed up at checkpoints.Not happy with it.
1,ibook review,"2 weeks after receiving the ibook, the optical drive stopped working. sending it to apple for repairs, they promptly lost my ibook for 2 weeks. on receiving the notebook i had still had problems with the optical drive, but am unwilling to be without my ibook for 2 weeks again. And to be able to use the optical drive, i cannot store any cd's or dvd's in the drive on putting the notebook to sleep or shutting it down which is time consuming and just silly. Also, on return, the different components of the ibook are not flush anymore and creaks. also one of the rubber ""feet"" on the bottom that the ibook rests on fell off and was lost since it covers a screw which the service dept. would have needed to access.on the positive, i like the os, but in the future am unwilling to pay extra for the supposed superior apple quality and service."
3,"iBook 14.1 inch 1.33GHZ Superdrive, superb-- expensive","I bought my iBook from Amazon.com through a referer website. Macintouch.com listed the price significantly lower than I could find anywhere else. The price difference turned out to be a rebate but that is fine for me. The rebate document was available through the rebate link off the product page and all the information required was here when my iBook arrived. I bought the two day shipping and was disappointed when, at the end of my transaction, the estimated date for shipping was seven days after my purchase then another two for the shipping.I was especially disappointed since the product page claimed the product would ship in one to two days. Fortunately the iBook shipped early-- two days later. It was packaged very safely and worked right out of the box.People have told me that buying the 14.1 inch iBook was a waste since"
5,WOW... this book touch my heart!,"This was an inspiring book. Their stories, strength, courage, and will to strive for life touch my heart and soul! My compassion have stretched from one end of the world to the other end. They've opened my perspectives to life outside and beyond of my own.If you're looking for a book with a home run straight to the soul, this is the book of the year!"
4,Amazing Fortitude,"The story is told from the viewpoint of each boy which became a bit redundant. But that, in no way, takes away from the story that needs to be told about what is happening on the African continent."
5,"""The Lost Boys""","I particularly enjoyed reading the story of these brave young men who miraculously found each other from time to time, after undergoing such terrible hardships trying to find help. My church offered our extra parsonage to six of the ""Lost Boys"" and they were a part of our congregation for almost two years. Several became members of our church, and still attend once in a while. Truly God was with these children during that time of horror. They were more resourceful than any American child would ever be, and we pray none will have to suffer as these kids did. We are so proud of ""our"" boys who learned to speak American English, who learned to get around the city on bicycles, and later in their cars. Most have finished college now. I'm sure the stories of our young men parallels that of the three who shared their stories in this book. Ann Luna, Nashville, TN"
5,Couldn't put it down,"As a former NFL player, I thought I was tough. But when I read what these young boys overcame, it made me appreciate what life is really about. A friend recommended the book and after I started it, I couldn't put it down until I finished it the next morning. Their triumph over all odds is uplifting. After the tragic events of recent days, this is a must read for all to learn about the strength of the human spirit."
5,Attention teachers. Don't miss this one.,"""They Poured fire On Us From The Sky"" is a High School classic. This incredible book exposes the horrible face of war through the eyes of children. While most of us have become dulled by the images of horror on TV, always feeling helpless, this wonderful book, through the eyes of these three boys forces you to realize that the human spirit continues to hope despite, torture, rape, starvation and death. That the next stop just might be freedom. What an extraordinary way to help students learn from Alephonsion, Deng and Benjamin, with their clear and insightful languge, the horrific situation in the Sudan is alive."
5,Your Life Will Change Forever When You Read this Book,"I read the book 2 years ago and it's as inspirational as any book can be. Things that I thought mattered are silly to me now. I almost didn't read it because anything about children suffering I stay away from. But each time I saw it in the book store it was calling me to pick it up. They Poured Fire on Us from the Sky... what an unusual name for a book. I wondered what it meant. And what is the significance of the red shorts? The book is so well written and powerful with just the perfect tone that even middle school children on up should read it. By the end you will feel this book is about 3 wisemen, not 3 boys. The book will teach you to forget about your ego and make you want to spread kindness in the world."
2,An overkill textbook,"As a textbook for an accounting systems class, this text is extremely cumbersome and long-winded. The authors seem to want to beat every subject to death, which results in excrutiatingly long chapters. Much of the material may be relevant to information systems majors taking it in a series of two classes, but is probably not suitable for an accounting major class. The writing style is boring and cryptic in many places. Look into the Gelinas/Sutton/Oram or Bodnar/Hopwood books for much better content and readability."
3,I didn't know type could be so dull.,I honestly had trouble staying awake reading this one. I'm very interested in type design and typography but the pace of this book made me feel like a kid with attention deficit disorder watching C-Span. There's a lot of interviews so definitely get your money's worth. Illustrations are bit sparse for a book on type and the whole book comes across as überconservative.
3,The worst of the Fellows (but still worth it for a fan),"This is probably the weakest of the Young Fresh Fellows' albums. That's not to say that's it's a total dud all the way through; there are plenty of songs to like. ""Celebration,"" ""You're Not Supposed To Laugh,"" and the theme song all rank among the Fellows' best work, and ""The Universal Trendsetter"" and ""I'd Say That You Were Upset"" exemplify the kind of humor that was so pervasive on the band's earlier albums. Many of the tracks on here just don't grab me, however. Some are fairly boring, and others are noisy without saying much. That's not to say that you won't like them (they've been growing on me), but this probably shouldn't be your introduction to the wonderful world of the Young Fresh Fellows. Get it after you're familiar with the group's better work."
2,Buy it used,"Who would really rate the Fellows but their fans? And you read the reviews and we're all basically saying the same thing: you should have it because the Fellows rock, but in the grand scheme of things, all their other albums are better. I would suggest This One's For The Ladies, or any one of their other albums. But pick this up eventually, because the Fellows guarantee a smile, even when they have songs like ""Take My Brain Away"" on them. You will never see a better live show than the Fellows. I can only hope you already own a few better records."
4,Great Music for Children,"This is a great music CD. My Grandchilren are between the ages of 2 years and 8 years and all three enjoy the songs. I even like them. We play it in the car traveling around and it makes the trip that much more enjoyable.. I hear them singing along with the music. I sing along also.So many times childrens music is not that good for children and adults combined. This one fills the bill. I got the CD at the library and we all liked it so much that I purchased it. now, that's a great reccommendation, I think. The songs are catchy and the words appropiate.This is just a Great CD. Nothing else to say!"
5,Reliving my childhood,"My sister and I loved Rosenshontz when we were kids ... we had all their cassette tapes (yes, tapes) and went to see them in concert a few times. My sister bought this for my daughter for her 1st birthday and I'm just loving it. My daughter likes it too, although the music is definitely geared more towards the preschool/early school age kid. I know that these are fun songs we'll sing together for years to come!"
5,Must-have,"I got this book for my daughter over a year ago and it is still a favorite. The flaps are fun, the touchy-feely parts are very well done, and there are a lot of little details -- like spiders and worms in the farmyard -- that give you a lot more mileage for learning than a book with just a story. It's also very sturdy. I recommend it to friends over and over."
2,Animal HIde and Seek,Was disappointing in the quality. One flap was completely gone when received. Several of the flaps were worn pretty badly. I will not buy from this company again.
2,Rather dull book,"The touchy-feely parts on the animals are tiny. The text is repetitive. The book is for a gift for a 2-year old, who has not yet received it, so her appreciation of it is yet to be seen. The used book was accurately described and in very good condition, with only 2 flaps showing noticeable wear (folds/wrinkles)."
4,Byron & Shelley,"The first time I saw this movie, I loved the way that fantasy and reality collide; how Frankenstein monster changes the lives of the Byron and Shelley. I love the characters mainly because of their flaws, mainly Byron's debauchery and Shelley's insecurities.The photography is beautiful and the actors make a good job."
4,I thought it was good.....mysterious....,"I didn't watch from beginning to end...rather came in after it began and no telling how much I missed....yet I liked it enough to scout out what it was. The monster made it somewhat spooky and mysterious and that grabbed my attention. Guess I don't know why so many don't like it.....I'd like to see it in its entirety, not for Hugh Grant...but to better understand the story."
2,not very interesting,"maybe i'm just too picky because i'm fond of the quality of recent bbc films. i did not think much of this movie (pseudo-artsy, in my opinion..very drab and plotless). the characters are flat and boring. honestly, i can't believe i watched the whole movie."
2,2 Hours of my life I can't get back,"Based on other reviews, I went in with moderate-to-high hopes. Oh, how mistaken I was. Instead I was met with a plotless film, which would have been fine if the characters were developed more. The only character with any color is Hugh Grant's Lord Byron, who plays the part with delicious cynicism and wit. The rest of the cast is pretty flat--none of them show any of the intellect or personality their real-life counterparts were known to have. The so-called metaphorical monster is less metaphor and more of a big guy who looks bored and speaks haltingly. His presence in the film gave me hope that the plot would indeed show up, but alas no. Apart from fodder for Hugh Grant gazing, the film does have an occasionally topless Elizabeth Hurley in a supporting role, though it took me a minute to recognize her due to her generous eyebrows (must have been filmed in her pre-Estee Lauder spokesmodel days)."
2,This is a terrible movie.,I had great hopes for this early Hugh Grant movie. I had never heard of it and I now know why. Strange and without a story line. We felt we had truly wasted our time watching this.
1,wrong book,"this book is the instructors manual to the text, it's not the actual book, take notice. and thank you seller, for correcting the typo."
1,Dont Waste Your Money!!,This video is worthless. It breezes over important concepts and the drum tuning chapter is a joke - it doesnt even show you how to tune or explain in any detail. I WOULD NOT recommend this video to ANYONE.
3,"Useful, But Not A Lot Here","While this DVD is certainly helpful, you could probably get another DVD with more complete instruction. When I saw how little this cost, I thought I was getting a bargain, but in the end I got only what I paid for. This DVD lasts about 30 minutes and is very basic -- half of it consists of grips and proper stroke technique and does not get beyond a few rudiments. I find the content useful and necessary for proficiency, but would rather have spent more on a more comprehensive DVD. I like listening to the portions of the DVD that feature Breithaupt playing -- he is very accomplished."
2,Had potential to be better...,"I picked up this DVD in the hopes to learning more about basic playing concepts with the snare drum. I was fairly dissappointed that this was just more of a high level overview and not very specific. They did glance over a lot of the basics and as most instructional DVD's, they don't take the time to break down the concepts, the just blow through it. DVD was very short...I am not really sure who could benefit from this DVD."
4,A Pleasant Collection - could be more varied though,"The first one in this set of two CDs contains a varied and pleasant collection of traditional and modern music from Ambon, Seram, Kei and Tanimbar in southern Maluku. Most songs are even pleasant to listen to for Western ears!Unfortunately the second CD, devoted entirely to North Maluku, actually only has recordings of traditional music from the tiny but historically important island of Ternate. While these are not bad, it would have been far more interesting if they include traditional music from other islands of North Maluku, such as Halmahera or Makian, both of which have very strong and distinctive traditions of music all their own.If you are interested in the music and culture of Maluku, this set of CDs is certainly worth buying, but so is the single CD ""Music of Maluku: Halmahera, Buru, Kei"" from the Smithonian Folkways series, which includes traditional music from Makian as well."
1,terrible movie,"If Jodie Foster wasn't in this movie it would even be rejected by 'Lifetime'. I can't believe anyone could seriously like this,but thats is just how I feel."
1,WARNING,Fellas-Trust me here. Dont let your girl rope you into this one.Just say no.or else its...MEESSAAAA CHICKOBEEEE...for 8 hours.
1,More sterotypes from Hollywood,"Why is it that Hollywood just can't resist those southern Appalachian stereotypes? This movie was based on a stage play that was set in the Pacific northwest, but Hollywood is convinced that such a story could only take place in the southern Appalachians. Admittedly Foster does turn in an impressive performance, but that can't make up for the insistence Hollywood has for continuing to stereotype an entire group of people."
3,Nell DVD,"The movie messed up in the middle, cleaning the DVD was no help. My only thought is that the disc was of poor quality."
5,Nahl haf gik derto,Maka sertu quino. Nell non himpler bevasitin no fo me in weseng inta loooooooooo. Nell ac-min-hotay. Me Nell! nong foil ronnto beeeeeeeeeeee!! Me Nelllllllll.
5,Blown Away!,"I could not help but to write a review for this movie. When I first read the description I wasn't sure if it was something that I would like. Boy, am I glad I clicked on the watch now button. The story is about a young woman that everyone (except the two doctors that are trying to help and protect her from the ""medical community"" and the news media) thought to be crazy and should be in an institution. Turns out that she was wiser and knew more about what is important in life than most people. The acting is superb. One of the best movies I've ever seen."
4,Nell,"I think it was a very nice movie, but it was kind of confusing. I didn't understand the role of the sherrif's wife. I think they should have told you how her sister died. But I think it was a wonderful story and that Jodie Foster was perfect for the part of Nell."
4,"A film for thinkers, and a great performance by Foster","This movie is not for everyone. If stuff akin to ""Dumb and Dumber"" and ""Terminator"" are your normal faire, you'll hate this picture. But if you like a drama with all kinds of thoughtful insights on what it means to be human and social, you'll appreciate this one. Foster turns in a spell-binding performance in the truest sense -- you feel like you've been drawn into another world after watching her."
4,A great movie with an unforgettable performance,"The first thing that impressed me most in this movie is the unforgettable performance by Jodie Foster. If you want to know what ""putting a soul into the role"" means, that's the exact case. She is almost always impressive, but this is a performance that you will remember for the rest of your life once you see it. The interesting plot keeps you stuck to the screen. Nell is a girl, who has been brought up in an isolated world. She never knew anyone except her mother and her twin sister. The remote forests of North Carolina have always been her home. The movie is very beautifully shot, with a lot of fantastic sceneries. Liam Neeson is another powerful point of ""Nell"". One of the best movies of the 90's. Highly recommended."
4,Wonderful Movie,"This is a wonderful movie, and a great showcase of talented actors. Foster does a tear commanding performance of a young girl who is left alone in an isolated house in the woods after her elderly mother dies. Since her mother had a stroke while Nell was young, she never learned how to talk properly and is difficult to understand. A deep, sad story unfolds as doctors and others in the community try to unravel the life of this misunderstood young woman.Chrissy K. McVay - Author"
2,Too long for the money,"The best character of the movie is the lake - it is absolutely beautiful and incredibly well filmed. Jodie Foster is a great actress, but why did she agree to be surrounded by the cardboard characters of two doctors and others? The scientist in chief, the sheriff are absolutely predictable. The ending is quite predictable and soooo much corny Hollywood.... Waste of 1hr 52 minutes of my time. Had I not read raving reviews, I would have skipped it without regrets."
1,Best performance,"Jodi foster is at her best in this movie, my favorite. Try Panic room, another great Jodie Foster performance. Enjoy!"
4,Enjoyed the JD Robb story alot,"Wanted to read the JD Robb story and I bought the book so I could. The other stories were ok, Not something I would buy on purpose but they were enjoyable."
5,only some of the stories,"(Haunted in Death by Robb, Poppy's Coin by Mary Blayney The Passenger by Ruth Ryan Langan, Mellow Lemon Yellow by Mary Kay McComas)In this anthology of futuristic mystery stories, I enjoyed Robb's HAUNTED IN DEATH - a brief in-between story for the Eve Dallas IN DEATH series. Eve and Roarke have to face the history of a murder site - and the ghosts that haunt it. In POPPY'S COIN by Mary Blayney, romance blooms between two unlikely people when they are brought together by Poppy's coin, which grants the beholder's most wanted wish - but only if it is something that should be. THE PASSENGER brings together two people who realize how much the need each other to fulfill their lives - but only when thrown together in a magical wilderness. McComas' story of MELLOW LEMON YELLOW is an eye-opener - not scary - for a young woman who has devoted her life to her parents, and now has to live her own life. This was definitely an interesting mix of stories - great for passing time."
3,Okay but...,"As a huge fan of J.D. Robb, I knew I would buy this book for her story alone. While it was an okay short story, it's not great. In my opinion, both of the other short stories that Robb has done in other anthologies adds something to the overall ""mystique"" of the In Death series.I couldn't read the second story (Poppy's Coin). No interest.Both The Passenger and Mellow Lemon Yellow were interesting reads. Of course, throughout the entire reading of Mellow Lemon Yellow, I kept thinking about the movie ""Drop Dead Fred"" which explores a similar premise.Overall, enjoyable and easy reading."
2,I was wishing for more.,I loved the J.D. Robb story but somehow I was expecting more from the other authors. I was disappointed and if it weren't for J.D. Robb I never would have bought this book.
4,JD Robb the high note; others fall flat,"I read everything written by Nora Roberts and her pseudonym, JD Robb, and this novella, ""Haunted in Death"" goes on my shelf right along with all the others.That being said, I will likely never read the other stories in here again; they were well-written, but mostly uninteresting, and far too different from the one story I bought the book for. Still, you can't get everything, and not every anthology can be an all-round winner. ""Haunted in Death"" is, in my mind, worth the cost of the book all on its own."
1,False advertising,"The cover says in capital letters ""J.D. ROBB BUMP IN THE NIGHT"". This book is a collection of four authors. J.D. Robb's contribution is 1/4th of the book. I didn't think it was very good story. Neither were the other three. -- All four stories had paranormal themes. When I buy J.D. Robb books, I'm looking for a detective story, not a ghost story."
1,This is a huge waste of money.,"If you want the real thing don't buy this beret. It's cheaply made, nylon, and any soldier who's ever had a real beret on should NOT be okay with wearing this thing. I wouldn't think of disgracing the uniform by wearing this beret with my ASU's. I 100% disagree with the two reviews above me. If you need a beret do yourself a favor and talk to your supply sergeant."
1,Ouch...,"Someone must have said ""Make some noise!""... and they did! I really don't like this one... just not the kind of music I go for, I'm afraid. Maybe if you're into the heavy trance kinda stuff, you might like this one, but personally I say: let's skip this one!"
1,"""TURN IT OFF!""","This movie has major league camp value and is extremely bad in all aspects. Drug smugglers use ""vampires"" to help them combat law enforcement. These are not western ideas of vampires, but that of the orient. Vampire is a generic phrase used to indicate one that has come back from the dead. It is more akin to a zombie in a guerrilla mask. In this film the vampires move with their arms extended while hopping. The plot continuity of their abilities doesn't make any sense.One of the vampires has a witch ghost as its lover. She is upset that he was made into a vampire, so now they can't be together in the afterlife, but she gets over it.The Robo Vampire is really a robocop. He is created to fight the vampires. The dubbing was bad, even though the credits claimed they had a dialouge coach. The voices didn't match the faces either. Rice powder will wake up vampires.The film has a high 5 star MST value.Parental Guide: F-bomb, nudity."
4,We'll See,"I got this for my golf nut father. It was the only one that would fit his modified (to four person) cart w/out the canopy over the back seats. I also got a magnetic tent fan/light combo and cart heater. They make this cover much more usable. He can put it on by himself and can now ride to the clubhouse or the neighbors in the rain and cold. It seems to be nicely made and fits great. The first time he put it on, a strap snagged around the back fender and tore at the seem a bit. So, we'll see how it holds up in the future. So far, so good."
3,This movie was good but misleading.,"When I purchased this movie I thought that it was about 8 men trapped in the desert. This part was true but no one said that this movie had no true plot. I gave it 3 stars because it did have some pretty sexy men it, and what was going on was pretty hot. But it is not told anywhere that there were no words to this movie. I thought that I was going to see an actual movie but to me it was not. If you want to see totally sexy men in the nude by all means get this movie. If you are looking for something more like I was you will be sadly disappointed."
4,Well done male softporn,"This film makes no pretense of a plot, and none is expected. The setting is the desert and seacoast and the men are all attractive, young, well built and nearly-always nude. The pace is slow, but will keep your attention. I'm sure the film is chiefly aimed at gay males, but straight women would certainly enjoy it too. If you like male soft porn this film is one of the better ones. Recommended."
4,highly recommended,"Besides the great price on the book, they kept me informed as to when my book had shipped and the time-line in which I would be seeing it on my doorstep. Great service. I would buy from them anytime."
3,"Anthropological classic, though not the easiest reads","I purchased this one as it was a part of course requirements at my major. Geertz' effort in the field of anthropology is undeniable. His contributions in understanding symbols of culture and how important interpreting them in the study of culture is, these things were discussed in my class. So for that, all students of Anthropology, especially Cultural/Social should read this one somewhere along their studies. However, it has to be said that the book is a demanding read. His sentence structures are complex, long-winded and hard-to-tackle academic reading. Parts of the book deal with New Nations (born after WW2) which are not that interesting, and which don't seem all that relevant.Still, Geertz' examples from the cultures of Bali, Trinidad and Indonesia make the book more understandable and all-in-all a good read."
5,cuppa yumyum,"It seems unfair all the delicious things I find when I visit far away lands. Then it is problematic feeding my newfound addictions when I get home.Anyhow, it may seem like a pretty penny for tea, but I like it tasty and strong fast (impatient). Also, it doesn't get as bitter as most teas after sitting about for a while. So, if I haven't finished my morning mug then at lunchtime I can nuke it for a few seconds and it is totally drinkable.I like also being able to get a huge box (although there are smaller denominations out there) that will last me for a month or two."
3,"At last, a decent chapter in the series!","At last! It looks like someone at Trimark Pictures actually watched the previous 2 movies, and hired someone with enough wit to pull this ridiculous conceit off. Director Brian Trenchard-Smith pulls out all the stops to deliver a funny and truly entertaining entry, with gags and gore to spare. If only they had got him to direct the previous films, we might have had a pretty fun series on the go . . . (oh well, I only hope they team up with New Line Cinema to produce a battle royal with Leprechaun versus Critters. Now, I would pay to see that!!!"
4,"Pretty good, but not the best!","It seems that Leprechaun has lost his touch a little. He tries his luck in Las Vegas and he isn't very lucky. This movie is very funny, ""I like Indian food""-says Leprechaun. The plot is easy to understand and the acting is not that sucessful. Caroline Willams stars in which adds a touch to the film. The killings are funny. All in all this movie is good, but it is not the best in the series."
1,THE WORST IN THE SERIES SINCE PART 4,"This film stinks and it is the worst like part 4,it has the Leprechaun wrapped in a neckless and he is stoned with it on,but a old man tells the pawn owner do not take the neckless off him,well the owner does and gets a bloody consequence.then the Leprechaun wanders the streets and casinos to find his missing coin a unlucky student has.just too silly,confusing,and tiresome."
3,"IT'S ALRIGHT, BUT IT'S STARTING TO GO A LITTLE BIT TOO FAR","THIS TIME, THE LEPRECHAUN RETURNS TO WREAK HAVOC IN LAS VEGAS. PRETTY MUCH AN AVERAGE HORROR SEQUEL. HAS SOME THRILLING MURDERS, BUT IT LACKS THE COOLNESS OF THE FIRST SEQUEL. I GUESS THIS ONE'S OK. BUT, THE NEXT MOVIE WOULDN'T TURN OUT SO GOOD."
3,Leprechaun is fear and loathing in Las Vegas,"Leprechaun 3 is by far the best in the series next to part 2 and features some good makeup effects and a neat setting,the city of Las Vegas. Leprechaun somehow got into Las Vegas after a homeless man brings him into a pawn shop and is looking for a coin that is lost after a pawn shop owner is trying to keep it and then a college student is having trouble with his car and a stripper who works at a hotel plans to let him stay in the hotel and when he makes a wish to become a good gambler and win and ends up being the hotel's luckiest person to stay there and then Leprechaun plans to kill him after he finds out he has his gold coin. Leprechaun 3 is the best of the series next part 2.The best scene is when Leprechaun is a magician and gets a chainsaw and cuts open a snotty magician and blood shots everywhere."
2,Avoid the Sequels,"The first Leprechaun had some laughs and some chills. Subsequent entries into the series are downright stupid. If you liked the first Leprechaun, I'd reccomend that you check out Demonic Toys, Puppet Master (1-3), or Dolls."
2,Leprechaun goes to VEGAS!,"Awful acting, plot... everything goes wrong in this sequel.Part 3, is the weakest entry in the ""Leprechaun"" series. Having Leprechaun go to Las Vegas was a fun idea but the movie fails to do anything about it.Leprechaun sounded funny & clever in the other parts, here the dialogue sounds extemely mindless, but some of the killings are hilarious.Watch it only if you liked the first 2 entries."
2,Leprechaun 3,The leprechaun is back in Los Vegas and is ready to get his gold back from who ever has it. Stupid movie if you ask me. It has some good scenes. Te acting is aweful except for the leprechaun. He is a great actor. The plot is dumb and boring. I bought this movie for $... and returned it. A little recommended. It was still good and funny at times.
1,A review from Mr. Entertainment Lover,A leprachaun goes to Las Vegas and starts killing people. This film is horrid and disgusting in every way.
1,No!!!! Look away,"No don't even look at this. If you are thinking about buying this i wish you the best of ""luck"" while you go on an adventure that will change your life 4ever.Leprechaun is pretty well ok movie, it trys to scare you. The rest of the movies are just pieces of crap. It goes from Crap 2 The biggest piece of crap you will ever witness in your life.C'mon a Leprechaun in space. Now, if that isn't stupid i don't know what is, and how he gets there still amazes me. How does he get in the space shuttle? A space Marine pisses on his leg, which from that piss travels into the marine and later pops out of his crotch during intercourse. Wow!!! i'll just leave it at that . WOW!!!!!"
1,Enough of the pot of crap,"This film really struck a chord for the worst, although not even close as when goes to space. The acting is laughable and the killings as well. They should have made it into one or two films tops but hey, people love to endorse on crap."
2,"Unfortunately, Just As Bad As 'Friday The 13th Part 9'","I am a fan of the 'Leprechaun' series. I really enjoyed the magical slasher element along with the humor in parts 1, 4 and especially 5. After watching part 3, I was very disappointed though. Once again, we get a change in powers and myths and the beginning of this chapter has no connection with the end of the last one. The change of setting is fine, but we definitely don't get enough of the leprechaun in the first half of the film. Instead we get stuck with lots of gambling and magic acts. The acting, especially by the lead male is pretty bad and the only thing that stands out is how underrated Warwick Davis is as he outshines the rest of the cast in the acting department. You can get this movie in a couple of different 'Leprechaun' sets. I wouldn't recommend you buy this movie on it's own even if you are a fan of the series."
2,Hmm,"Much like the Child's Play trilogy, the third time is NOT the charm! I really enjoyed the first and second movies, but this was a wholly unneccessary addition to the Leprechaun franchise. The plot was fairly interesting with the mortal guy gaining Leprechaun powers, but it was really hard to enjoy this movie. The best part of this movie was of course the Leprechaun himself - no matter how bad the Leprechaun movies get, the Leprechaun himself is awesome, his personality, his lines, his antics. If you liked the first and second, you might enjoy this one. If you've never seen a Leprechaun movie, then watch 1 and 2, or Leprechaun Back 2 Tha Hood."
5,Unendingly Amusing!,"This is the funniest movie I have ever seen and definetly the best of the Leprechaun movies! too bad it went direct-to-video, I think it could've gotten a lot of money!"
1,bleehhhhhhh,"god people, when will the horror end. now the bastards in Vegas making more murders because of his gold, thats the whole story of all the movies. his frickin gold. with mindnumbing supportees and bad directing. this is a toiletbowl mess.favorite line in the whole movieLeprechaun- there was an old man from O'Grass, his balls were made of brass and in stormy weather his balls clanked together and sparks flew out of his ass(this was hilarious)"
5,Canciones de Juan Gabriel en voz de Pandora,"Este disco Con Amor Eterno...es el primero de la colección de canciones de Juan Gabriel, evidendtemente una obra musical de excelencia en voz del trio femenino. Caray, querida, amor eterno, el noa noa, con tu amor. Son temas evidentemente para recordar la pasada época de los 90. 100% Recomendable."
5,What a combination! Juan Gabriel and Pandora!,My favorite group singing songs by my favorite composer...Sheer Heaven! There is not a bad song nor a bad performance on this entire album.
5,Pandora lo vuelve a lograr,"Interpretando lo mejor de Juan Gabriel. Las voces de estas 3 damas de veras que captan al oido. Todas las canciones son interpretadas con unas ""ganas"" y con muy buena voz. Les recomiendo este disco, es de lo mejor."
5,"Did I mention, nobody gets a 5 star ( Ooop's )","Ok Ok, It's all true....The apex (if you will) the height of Pop music is reached right here. Simply slide your mouse over and select the ""add to my cart"" button.Your musical road map will change forever, you will run to the store and buy a beat-up old guitar and sit for weeks playing this over and over, giddy with laughter as you lose your job but uncover the secrets of E A and C, oh yeah and G too (for the bridge)In other words it's simple, it's beautiful, it's funny it's timeless. No tricks no fancy production. A++ materialTo my entire generation these guys should have been the ""Beatles"" to my circle of 20 or so friends the ""Young Fresh Fellows"" were our Beatles...it's that important (In ""86"" I was 21)"
5,One of the greatest albums of all time,"The Fellows' 3rd album (and a great bonus EP!), and possibly their best, though it's a toss-up with their 1st and 2nd ones. Highlights? It's ALL highlights! But my personal faves have to be Get Outta My Cave and When The Girls Get Here, classic songs that have permeated the lives and memories of friends, family, etc. From the Refreshments EP tacked on here, Beer Money and Back Room of the Bar are YFF gems. Enjoy - and my eternal thanks to DN for turning me on to these guys."
4,MOHAWK,EXCELLENT WESTERN I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS MOVIE TO ANY ONE SO ALL YOU PEOPLE WHO LIKEWESTERNS BUY IT FROM AMAZON.COMMALCOLMEVANS6@HOTMAIL.COM
3,NEED BETTER PRINTS!!!!!,"The Alpha edition is probably as good as any. The print is fairly good, but with some color fluctuations and minor print damage. This only seems to be avaiable in a full screen edition. It's complete as far as I can tell."
1,Devilishly bad...,"The world may divide into two kinds of people. Those who like Alanis, and others who dislike her voice and choice of songs. Being one of the unlucky second group, I found this CD apalling. I follow on that the funny Amazon review by ""solidoak"".I understand Howard Shore has made great soundtracks remembered by all, but even soloists from the London Phil. can't make a corny score sound well. ""Mooby"", track 2 is particularly obnoxious. Don't get me wrong, I do like religious music, Fauré and Mozart's requiems, etc; I just don't like this pretence of the same genre. As ""a customer"" wrote: ""if you love hearing children's choirs on drugs singing a song with lyrics on drugs"".The CD itself is nice, the design on the disc, I mean. Track 6's ""ondes Martenot"" (I suppose it's an instrument) is of some interest.All in all I agree with Khaled Milad (Geneva)'s review: ""if you are a Morissette fan then this soundtrack will defintely please you and if you are not it may not be the wisest choice""."
3,It's all about Alanis,"I was already dismissing Alanis as just an OK singer, but when I rented ""Dogma"" and then heard her song ""Still"" at the end credits, I was shocked to hear such a mature song written by Alanis. It has a great message and just a beautiful sound. It truly is her most mature and one of her best, up to the standards of her two studio albums. If she can keep up with the great standard of ""Still"" on her next album, maybe all the people who accuse her of being a poseur will change their minds."
2,OH NO!,"I was disapointed with the standard of this CD. apart from the two tracks i could not isten to, the others were not original, and made no lasting impression. isnt that what music is supposed to do?"
3,Not As Expected,"Overall it is a good soundtrack. I only have one comment to make, and that is does anyone know the Name and Artist of the song that plays in the stripclub in the movie (Dogma) where Salma Hayek is dancing for Jay and Silent Bob... If so could you please email me at rex_hunt@hotmail.com...It would be much appreciated. Thank You."
4,Mooby the Golden Calf written by Kevin Smith,"This is a decent movie soundtrack. I found it captures the feel of the movie. The Alanis Morisette song is a nice bonus. The only thing I could have used was a lyrics list for ""Mooby the Golden Calf"". It's hard to understand the lyrics."
2,No! No! No!,"Y'want a review that's helpful? Here you go: Every review of this album goes like this: ""I loved Alanis' song, Still"". Loved it. As for the rest of the album...where was I? Oh yes, *Still* is a great song."" Arrgh! But, if you scroll down a bit, you can get the lyrics to Mooby (the choir song), as written by Kevin Smith. At least that's something."
3,A Surprisingly Entertaining Book,"I, a teenage reader, found the book in the children's section and thought I'd give it to my little brother to read, but I decided I wanted to read it first. It's surprisingly good. The main character is really into the analyzing and psychological aspects of the story but the author doesn't waste time with adjectives and descriptions just so the book is longer. It's a short book with a plot mainly in flashbacks. The plot? A genius teenage boy who is incredibly socially awkward is sent on a wilderness outing with his schoolmates who like to torment him. He constantly winds up paired with his main bully for all activities and after winding up trapped with him alone, he is forced to look again at the boy and how he got there. I would recommend it to the 14 year old who feels like s/he is 40 or to the adult trying to understand teenagers. Overall a good job but not a 5 star book."
3,heavy but not convincing,"Heavy on the prosopagraphy, this book requires strength just to get through it. For the layperson, the evidence may be overwhelming, but for the ancient historian the immediate question is: ""how do these family connections prove his theory"". The answer leads one to other questions as certain parts of the book enlighten and inform while others merely build up impression collections of names and familiar ties. In the end, a scholar must ask: ""Was there a revolution at all?"""
5,An Anatomy of a Murder,"How did the world's most powerful, free republic fall into dictatorship? This pressing question animates two classics of classical history--H. H. Scullard's ""From the Gracchi to Nero"" and Sir Ronald Syme's ""The Roman Revolution.""Syme's analysis of the end of the Free State is as authoritative as it is magisterial. Written in the terse, energetic style of Tacitus, RR shares Tacitus' verdict on the falling Republic--that a princeps, however horrible, was the only ""solution"" for a state ruled by warring, short-sighted, power-lusting factions.But what a marvel those factions were to behold! For the patient reader, there is a gripping story herein--as intricate as Puzo's ""The Godfather,"" as high-stakes as Hugo's ""Ninety-Three,"" as vibrant as Shakespeare. I think this is historiography at its best."
2,and yet another indulgent memoir,"The most compelling aspect of this rather indulgent memoir is Sojourner's retelling of her life and times with her ill mother. You really feel a sense of the anguish. Otherwise, the book unveils itself in a series of incomplete vignettes that are packaged like second-rate newspaper columns at best, and generally self-righteous and lacking in introspection.Sojourner is a real stalwart in Flagstaff; she manages to raise ver voice the loudest at most rallies. In truth, though, she doesn't live in the woods, as the marketing would like to present, but right off a paved highway in a cluster of cabins for tourists, two minutes from your local Walmart. And her rants against the corporatization of publishing now ring hollow given that she avidly sought to be published by a corporate juggernaut like Simon Schuster (and its Scribner imprint), instead of a truly independent press like Seal. Bottom line: so much for taking a stand; take the money and run."
4,Interesting mystery novel,"The Witches of All Saints was a little slow in developing the story. It moves along at a pace that is tolerable, but if it was quicker it would be more interesting and easier to get into. Despite that I liked this book because it has an interesting moral to it that isn't spelled out for the reader. It is also and interesting and unique story where the bad guy gets what he deserves in the end."
3,A pleasant surprise from a familiar author,"""Creed"" is an unexpected offering from one of my favorite guilty pleasures. Colleen McCullough's ""Tim"" and ""The Thornbirds"" are two of my favorite books, but I don't usually admit to being a fan since these stories are somewhat simplistic romances. This book is very different from her other works. While the writing style is still quite simple and her symbolism is much too obvious, the novel offers a thought-provoking vision of a not-too-distant and all-too-possible future. The creation of a modern day messiah through the government's manipulation of the media is a fascinating premise. This book makes me a little less shy about admitting that I am a McCullough fan."
1,Awful!,"I loved Colleen McCullough's Rome series, but this book is terrible. It's hard to believe the same author wrote these books. The characters are totally cheesy and one-dimensional, and the story lacks any subtlety. The Christ figure is named Joshua Christian, and his betrayer is named Judith. Give me a break! Give the readers a little more credit for being intelligent and figuring out the biblical analogy on their own."
3,Worth thinking about.,"Wow! How incredible to have just finished this book only a few days before the horrific attack on America. Much of the ""story"" is predictable, in some places tedious, however, the concepts have merit in the futuristic setting. The parallels to the life of Christ, government controls, and some hint of world-wide unity were indicative of the resources and talent of the author. I've read nearly all of her books and am a big fan of the ""Ceaser Series""."
2,A disappointing book from a talented writer.,"I began this book with much anticipation, having enjoyed many other titles by this author, but was terribly disappointed. Although the premise was interesting, the characters were wooden and predictable and the plot development dragged. (Carolyn G. Wade)"
1,Very disappointing,"I agree with other reviewers: her Roman series is wonderful, but this book is simplistic, obvious, pathetic, and poorly crafted. It was very disappointing."
2,Jesus at 2030,"I think that this book is the story of Jesus, I don't know why Colleen has written again this story 2030 years later, I didn't learn anything at all everything I just knew it."
5,Lots of information!,"I wondered how much information about herbs could be packed into a one hour DVD. The answer... a lot!This is a wonderful DVD and so much fun to watch, I've actually watched it over a few times already. Of course, a lot of the charm comes from the four West Ladies.Watching this DVD is almost as good as joining them in their herb garden and outdoor kitchen as they explain the growing of herbs, making herbal teas, making vinegars, etc. Highly recommended!"
4,Surprisingly eclectic,"From Kentucky, the ""center of the universe"", a selection from the American Voice journal presents poems, with neither a rural or parochial distribution or theme. There are poems from the Greek Nobel Laureate Odysseas Elytis, and Israeli soldier Yehunda Amichai. Numerous poets are translated from central and South American, including a surprising poem from Jorge Luis Borges about Lee's soldier in the Civil War.Looking at poetry anthologies, readers are left to form their own links between poems and this collection offers some startling ones. With a theme of quilts and scraps, there is the Kentuckian Catherine Sutton's haunting ""Graveyard Quilt"" to Jean Valentines allusion to the Aids quilt. Blood provides another common flow, for example Paula Allens' ""Blood flows in the cobbled alleys with all the filth"" . These poems expose the readers to a wide range of styles and locales."
5,"I enjoyed this ""little"" book","The books size is just right for sitting and daydreaming about the perfect outdoor tea party.I enjoyed the photos which were mesmerizing,and lovely.The book has ideas for various garden styles.My 11 year old granddaughter was also enthralled by the book.This book would be an excellant gift for children,as well as new, and experienced gardners."
2,The Case that won't close,"Look closely at the zoomed in picture... it isn't a snap, or a fold under, or even a strip of velcro that keeps your belkin cased closed on your belt, it's a small plastic nub and a little metal circle that doesnt' quite fit around the nub that keeps this case closed.And let's just be clear, it's failing at it's job.The reason I bought this case was so I could carry my ipod on my belt, but it would just look like a black box on my belt. Now it looks like a black box with an ipod inside with the case flap hanging open, like the the shot provided....I don't know who it was at Belkin who thought they'd replace the snap with a plastic nub, but they made a huge mistake.I have to wonder if they even bother to test these things at all.Deeply Unsatisfied."
5,Great case!,"This is a well-made case, and very convenient! Just clip it to your belt, and go! My old case broke, so I got this one, and it's great."
4,The Games,"Just in time for 06 Winter Games comes a book that affords the reader a behind-the-scenes look at what it might be like off the ice and off the mountain. This romance spins more than just the stories of relationships. The Games interweaves the emotions of love, competition, betrayal and friendship as it tells the story of loves past and new against a backdrop of international competition.The tension experienced by the reader will not just be of the sexual variety between characters. I felt my pulse racing as the athletes I came to care about competed. The peeks inside the world of world-class competition will give the reader a new perspective on what it must be like when years of training and perseverance come down to one final game, four minutes on the ice or the steadiness of a hand.If you are a fan of the Olympics, this a must read. And if you read just for the romance, you will not be disappointed either.Jerilyn Willin"
1,Why bother,"Low budget sound loops and tones played against post 911 speeches of George Bush. Wow innovative huh! Oh yes and I can't forget to mention that the speeches have been clipped so words like ""freedom"" and ""terror"" have been flip-flopped! Truely ingenious huh? I think not! The production does make one think as it plods on and on until your almost biting your nails hoping there isn't a surprise bonus track. One thought I had was ... How many prepubescent kids have chopped up clips of GW the same way just for kicks? Maybe they should all make CD's too! Another thought that came to mind was of all the things I could have better spent my money on and how much can I possibly recover when I take this CD down to the local used CD store. And my final thought before I removed the CD and started for the used CD exchange ... why did I even bother buying this?"
5,I love these for my lil guys,"This harness works well for your lil furry thats on the go like mine. My lil guys get so excited when they know they are going somewhere, they just cant hardly wait. The latches are easy to clasp for esay attatchment, but, not too easy to un-clasp (believe me...it works just right, dont want those lil guys to get out on the run)."
3,"good stories, mediocre art","I have to say I was underwhelmed by this book. The lack of text makes it more accessible to a wider range of readers, and the story lines were clearly understandable from the drawings, but the art style was somewhat off. It's hard to say why, exactly, but there were several times when the proportions seemed odd, and that distracted from the overall hotness of the message."
3,Not one of Ms. Lowell's Best But???,"I am as a rule a huge fan of this fine writer, but, ""Die in Plain Sight,"" (in my opinion) is not one of her best. I wish I would have checked it out of the library. If you really want to be entertained try Ms. Lowell's last 2 books they are terrific!"
2,Lowell's Die in Plain Sight was a dud,"After reading all of Elizabeth Lowell's books at least once, I have to say I was disappointed. The potential was definately there with a good basic plot of suspense and murder, but no surprises and therefore not much suspense. Romance between Lacey and Ian was never more than lukewarm. No big sparks between the characters and all the romance of watching paint dry. There is no challenge to the relationship, which is unusual considering it is Elizabeth Lowell and the relationship struggle is what I really enjoy about her previous books. I want the struggle to live happily every after with a true soul mate. All the hot romance, misunderstandings, trust issues, suspenseful plots with twists and turns were missing from this latest effort. Would the real Elizabeth Lowell please come back? Please, before Ms. Lowell writes about the rest of the Donovan clan come back to the hot romance and great suspence that have kept your fans enthralled and devoted for years!"
3,"Not bad, read it if you have it and the time","This was a hand me down book from my MIL so it was not purchased. I make my comments based by someone who didn't have to pay for the book. I'm not sure if I've read Lowell before or not. If I have, it wasn't good enough to remember it. Die In Plain Sight was ok. I have to agree with other reviewers that mentioned the chemistry between any of the characters isn't well developed which makes it harder to believe. I read quickly because I wanted to know how the mystery unfolded itself but as the story moves on you can tell one of the twists easily. It's entertaining if you need a book to read and like juicy/mystery books. I wouldn't go out of my way to purchase it, but it was handy to read when I didn't have anything else."
3,Reviews by Nan Kilar and Bobby Miller,"Lacey Quinn is an artist and co-owner of an artsy shop in Corona Del Mar, CA. Famous artist Susa Donovan is in town as a publicity thing for the Friends of Mercer County art auction. Ian Lapstrake is a PI for Rarities Unlimited hired to guard Susa while she's in town.Lacey has many of her deceased grandfather's paintings which she thinks are just super. Susa has agreed to appraise any artwork people bring in, searching for new talent and unknown artists. She realizes the paintings Lacey shows her are the work of a by-gone artist. Then Lacey finds out from her father that grandpa just painted forgeries of Lewis Marten's works.Throw in fires, a theft, a love story, a death threat, intrigue and various subplots with way too many characters and you've got a story that keeps you going to the end."
1,rhonda.laluna,"Die In Plain Sight died for me when I reached chapter five and say enough was enough. They say in the book world that if you don't catch your reader by the first chapter, you've lost. This book was very confusing to me and to move on to another of my favorite authors. However, I loved ""Moving Target"" and ""Running Scared"", both connected with the group ""Rarities Unlimited"". I thought this book, which is a part of the Rarities would be the same quality, but sad to say, it's not.A disappointed reader."
3,"Good , but not as good as others","Like other reviewers it was good and I loved these character in other books, but the story itself wasn't up to Ms Lowell stander. I do look forward to her next book about the twins, I hope she back at her best, because that book should have a lot to offer. I have brought all of her books and will again."
2,Definetly Not Her Best,"This book was definetly not one of her best. To me, it seemed like the ending wasn't as developed as any of her other books and came to quickly. There wasn't enough details and the twists and turns the book has left me confused at times. I have been a fan of her books for years and have always bought them as soon as they came out but I am sorry that I bought the book in hardcover. I should have just waited for the paperback."
1,Pointless,"There's not much of a mystery, nor is there any real suspense, even to the love interest. This book is more like sex and violence pornography made genteel for people who live in tract homes."
2,It didn't have to suck,"The writing was okay. I've read worse stories. The characters were not great. That was probably my biggest problem with the story. None of the characters had even the slightest ring of truth to them. Ian Lapstrake was the phoniest male protagonist I've seen in quite some time. Completely unbelievable. Almost romance novel caliber. In fact, the entire book has the feel of a romance novel that has been repackaged for wider appeal. Unfortunately, it fell well short of that appeal."
2,"Started enticingly, then fizzled out","I, too, enjoyed the 3 characters of Ian, Susa and the protagonist, whose name escapes just now. Wish the story had been more interesting. The ending was fairly predictable; anticlimactic. I was looking for thrill and fascination with the art world (ala the Da Vinci Code), and got more sex than art. I'm sorry I bought the book. Should have borrowed it from the library. It's not a keeper."
1,"no suspense, no romance, no zing","""Die in Plain Sight"" was the second Elizabeth Lowell I read. The first, ""The Color of Death"" was very good, and I was hoping for more of the same.What I got was a fluffy piece with no suspense, no real drama, and characters that were so incredibly superficial they were nearly transparent. The hero in particular is hard to believe, given he is flawless in strengths, smarts and looks it makes him not very interesting to read. Even if he had a scar or SOMETHING that made him a little more tangible, it would have helped.The heroine, a zany new-ager painting prodigy, stumbles through life as a victim of happenstance. Her adventure is a jumble of hastily thrown together occurrences which happen to end with her being the protégé of a famous and beloved painter and engaged to the man of her dreams. Never did a character in a book have to work so little to achieve so much.A disappointment for sure."
2,Disappointed again,"I truly enjoyed Ian and Lacy, but something lacked in this story. I will say that the story line that has been appearing in your Rarities Series are starting to sound predictable which leaves the reader disappointed. I will try to stay an avid reader of yours, but lately it&#65533;s been hard to shell out the extra bucks for hardcover that leave me rather unsatisfied."
1,Stupefyingly Bad,"Before this I read Lowell's The Wrong Hostage and enjoyed it. This, however, was dreadful. Pointless, inert and populated with cardboard characters. The publisher had to know how putred this was, but I guess they wanted to make a buck and avoid pissing off a lucrative author."
2,Too slow and boring...couldn't finish it.,"I got one-quarter through this book, and just couldn't endure it any longer. The plot moved at a snail's pace. Pages and pages were devoted to mundane events. The dialogue, especially that of Ian and Lacey, was incredibly hokey. Also, after the previous books painted Susa as this impressive, sophisticated woman, I found her portrayal in this book to be rather banal. Anyway, I have no idea how the book turns out, and I don't care. Don't waste your money."
4,Brilliant musician - very good composer.,"This documentary unapologetically has a mission: to elevate Charles Mingus' status to ""great"" composer. Whether he is or is not can be argued, but when compared with the likes of Duke Ellington who was unquestionably a great composer, he might move down just a notch. A ""great"" bass player? Unquestionably. Herein lies my complaint: not enough focus on Mingus the bass player. That being said, this documentary makes it clear that Mingus and music are one. The most introspective moments come in the form of home movies of Mingus sitting at the piano composing. One scene in particular has him playing ""Goodbye Pork Pie Hat"" on an old upright to his daughter. Clearly this documentary was a work of love put together by those who revere his music and want to keep it alive. Make no mistake, the music is great and this documentary is a worthy effort."
3,Not what I envisioned,"I had envisioned a full scale set of maps like the map found in the DM's guide. Not so, these are good reference and will help PC's get a good idea of the dungeon but you cannot play on the maps themselves. I can and will use these maps, by all means buy them they are going to make a great addition to my campaings but don't expect to use then as a playing field."
5,The power of a negative review,"Before you read any more, please know that I haven't read this book: I just felt sorry for it! I had seen the review of this book in the NYTimes Book Review, and it looked like just the escape reading to get me through the upcoming holidays. I kept hearing wonderful things about and was all set to have it sent right away. . .until I read Pavluvcik's review. Strange, isn't it: no matter how many good things we hear about a book, the negative things really stick, maybe even determine whether we choose to read a book or not. I always tell my middle school students to temper their negative comments about books with the thought that some other reader might disagree with them, but I guess such niceties have no place in the cyberspace book club. Anyway, I wouldn't order the book on a bet now, so I guess what I've been telling my students all these years must be true."
2,Not Free SF Reader,"The second in Pierce's Darkangel Trilogy. The protagonist of the piece has made nice with the vampire guy, and wants to do the darkangel mambo with him, as well, basically.There is still more odd questing to be undergone to find other things, as this young woman has to walk the line between the whole human and vampire thing in this odd and precarious setting."
2,Disappointing,"Gosh. The darkangel was one of my all time faves.I didnt realise she'd written more, and I wish she hadnt.I havent read the 3rd yet, but hope it improves.There was too much action and magic and too many characters, everything was spread too thinly. This book wasnt written from the heart- sorry M.A.P -but thanks for the 1st, THE DARKANGEL! Which gets 5 stars. This book was just terrible. Its all over the place. I just cant get over it."
5,"A beautiful tale, worthy to follow Book 1","Another amazing story from this lightly gothic author. Ariel continues her quest - her journey takes us further into the historical mysteries surrounding her strange world in her quest to stop the water demon. Beautifully written. I'd love to see some illustrations akin to those much loved from C.S. Lewis' The Chronicles of Narnia. To be read at night out loud like a children's story book, but with a few darker themes. A classic!"
5,Best of the three,"I first discovered Meredith Ann Pierce through the Firebringer books, then sought out The Darkangel because I needed to read everything she wrote. I love her style, and even after reading the trilogy several times I don't get tired of the language and characters.This is the only one of the three I had to replace because I literally wore out my paperback copy. The first is the most adventure and the third the most revelation, but A Gathering of Gargoyles is what moves the quest from impossibility to hope and gives Aeriel the beginnings of her confidence and identity. This is the best one to pick up and read on its own."
5,Great Book,"I loved this book. I accidentally discovered The Darkangel and A Gathering of Gargoyles at my school library, it was a pretty old version, but I loved it. Very interesting. Great for someone who's into fantasy and magic. It was very hard to find the last book."
5,The Original Romantic Comedy,"If you like to watch a romantic movie and be highly amused at the same time, this is THE ONE. A remake with one of the original cast, Doris Day as usual, brings her own unique funny pathos to this lovely film. Do the ironing, watch the film, the job will seem worthwhile."
5,Move Over Darling,It's my favorite Doris Day movie. I would stay up at midnight if I knew it was going to be on TV. This is before video and DVD's.
3,something had to give,"---And that something was Marilyn whose memory and the events surrounding her dismissal from the movie overcasts the whole enterprise. This is emphasised in the DVD extras which compares scenes played by her and later by Doris. What we have now is a more farcical comedy,generally entertaining, well played by Doris who doesnt take the story so seriously as Marilyn was strainng to do. James Garner, Polly Bergen , and Thelma Ritter provide good support. The DVD transfer is excellent with interesting extras.If you like the stars and want something lightweight to cheer up the day this is for you."
4,Doris at her Best!,"always enjoyed this movie, been waiting for it to come out on DVD for quite awhile."
3,Rushed?,"I bought this film, and was pleased. However, it seemed somewhat rushed in it's pacing. I think the Marilyn Monroe version would have been at a higher, more adult level and a better pace. But we are talking Doris Day here! It's neat to note that they used the same set for the house in this film, as in the Monroe version."
3,inferior copy,"This additional remake of the Grant and Dunne Classic 'My Favourite Wife', is an inferior copy. James Garner brings a spark of 'class' and true acting ability, to the film, but Doris Day is far from being an accomplished actress - in spite of a pleasant voice and a pleasing appearance and disposition.This movie is NOT a patch on the earlier 'My Favourite Wife', starring Cary Grant and Irene Dunne.Re-makes sometimes work - this one didn't!"
4,I finally found this wonderful movie!,"I grew up watching Doris Day movies on T.V. They were always wonderful and fun. Now that I have young children I love to share these fun, innocent movies with them. Doris Day with any leading man...Rock Hudson, James Garner, or Gary Grant is always a treat. Thanks for finally releasing this one! I have been looking for it for years!"
4,Doris Day at her best,"Amazon is amazing at appraising the value of recorded items. Doris Day put out a series of films and this one was highest priced. If you are the weird combination of a male movie fan AND a Doris Day fan, then this is an absolute must purchase. I won't tell you why, just trust me. For female fans, it is a good comedy, the usual crazy romp where there are comic missteps, overlaps, misunderstandings, etc. Overall, it was perhaps the 2nd funniest of the Doris Day films."
1,Predictable,This was not a good Doris Day film. The script and plot were ridiculous and predictable. Just a silly movie that was not very creative.
2,What a Horrible Movie!!!,"The only reason I am giving this movie 2 stars is because Cary Grant and Irene Dunne are mentioned. Otherwise, this movie was awful. Perhaps if I didn't see the original, ""My Favorite Wife,"" I would have enjoyed it more, but after seeing such a wonderful movie as the original, this one can't even be compared. This movie was dragged out much too long. If you want to see a great movie, see ""My Favorite Wife,"" which is my favorite movie."
3,I'm only giving it three stars because it's a remake,"This is based on my mother's review of the film. I haven't watched it. She saw the other versons of the film and liked the other earlier versions better. So it's not near the top of her list as movies to watch or re-watch. Some sequels are better than the originals, some aren't. This probably isn't a bad movie, but nothing special."
4,Que Sera,"Typical Doris Day movie... not an academy award winner, but solid entertainment. When women were ladies and men were gentlemen... no foul language, just timeless humor. Don Knotts is hilarity personified."
1,waste of money for average players,"If you like books that give pages and pages of annotated lines, with little explanation of strategy and ideas of the opening lines that it gives...then this is the book for you. If you want to learn more about these openings, which one would need to understand the underlying strategies which this book does not give...then this book is a waste of money. If you make up the less than 1% of chess players that comprise masters and up, then this book would make a great addition to your growing collection. If you are not a master, which I am sure you are not, then look elsewhere for books on these lines."
5,Excelent product,My wife now swears by this product. It does not upset her stomach like similar products. She has already recommeded it to a friend.
5,Great Family Movie,"A LITTLE PIECE OF HEAVEN.....SOMETIMES ANGELS CAN BE FOUND ON EARTH Will Loomis (Kirk Cameron) is an 18 year old who inherits the care of his handicapped sister and their family farm when his adoptive parents pass away. Will's tremendous heart is in the right place when he attempts to create an idyllic home for himself, his sister and two troubled children who are badly in need of a family. While his intentions are good, Will's decision s are not and he's soon the primary suspect in a criminal investigation. Will learns that even guardian angels must take responsibility for their actions, and that when you give love unconditionally, heave in never far away."
4,American History Student,"We used Volumes I and II of this book in my AP US History class this year. I found these books to be more interesting and easier to enjoy than the general textbook. They go more in depth and offer a greater understanding. At times they are a little hard to follow - but that may have been a result of not really paying attention while I was reading... oops. Hey it's homework, give me a break. Anyway, they're good books - ROCK ON COMMAGER!"
1,"DON""T BE FOOLED!!!! THE REAL THING.....","don't be fooled by its ""real"" price before sales I have no idea what they were thinking $$$99.99...!!??? So if you think that you are getting a bargain you are NOT, the actual real price is what they are asking for it... $14.99. regarless I am buying it for my nephew and hope that he likes it.They get 1 star because they are liars!"
3,"Good, but flawed","I mostly enjoyed the book, except for the author's need interject explanations of ""real world"" things. I half expected to find a map in the book with a big arrow pointing to Iran in case I didn't know what ""Iran"" was. Another device I didn't like was when one character would say something clever, and another character would think, ""How clever!"" Thanks, Mr. Bram, but you don't need to use one of your characters to tell us that your writing is clever. And your ending in which you suddenly starting speaking in your own voice was completely out of place."
3,JIMINY CRICKET I WISH I HAD PURCHASED THE BLU RAY!,"The drama and historical aspects are great,however the picture quality is not up to snuff with my DVD version.I super duper like this movie and am proud to have it in my collection.This movie is a nice addition to ""THE LEGEND OF SURIYOTHAI"",another action epic concerning the history of the SIAMESE and BURMESE people.Thenceforth when i add a BLU-RAY copy to my other films i will have a FIVE STAR adventure,not a three star. YES, life is good in the world of FIVE STAR movies!"
1,Travaler1 movies,I wasn't impressed with this movie. It was more a history of the country than of fighting to improve the lives of the people. I wouldn't recommend this movie.
4,Some educational information on a little known country of Siam,"This was a good educational film on Siam before it became Thailand and Burma before it became Miramar. I had the good fortune to visit Thailand and enjoyed the people and culture. For some of older folks I enjoyed going to the movies to see the musical masterpiece The King and I. However, like a similar foreign film called the Red Cliff I struggled with the first part of this 2 disk set trying to get a handle on which of the various Lords was on which side. The main characters were not a problem but, who was aligned with each was a big problem with me I just could not keep track. So with the subtitles and the foreign names it was tough. Still I would recommend this film for those who enjoy watching a fairly good foreign film."
5,Great two disc set -- can't wait for 3rd installment,"This movie is really good .. very long with both discs (I think close to 4.5 to 5 hours) but it kept my interest all the way through. The story based on actual history is very good, with excellent character development, acting and humor as well as excellent action scenes. I can hardly wait for the excpected follows on DVDs ..."
2,Kingdom of War Part 1 and Part 2,The ratings I assign to a movie are based on environment. Another person might have a different opinion. Thats why there is freedom of choice.
1,No Content,I cannot comment on the movie - as my all region Oppo will not play it!!! I assume that there's no content on the disc or some other problem. I have not returned it because it's a pain in the a-- to do so. I hate throwing money away. Obviously others have not had the same experience.
4,"""wtf is this?"".....come on","I am writing a response to a reviewer who stated ""wtf is this?"" and complained that this collection didn't include the first film. Well my friend, you apparently do not know your films very well. The first Child's Play was released by MGM. All the sequels (Child's Play 2, Child's Play 3, and Bride of Chucky) were released by Universal Pictures. Since MGM and UNIVERSAL are rival motion picture companies, there is no way in hell the first film would be included int his box set. So quite complaining! This box set is awsome and you really save some dough by buying it. You just have to buy the first movie seperatly."
4,great box set!,"you i know that i love box sets and i love this childs play box set as well the only bad thing is that the 1st inst in it because its mgm,,but thats fine. these movie scared me when i was a boy but know watching it you can really find the dark humor in it. alot of people will dog this movie like Michael ""Critical Writing"" but what does he know,all the movies he likes all suck anyway,,because honestly how can a lord of the rings nerd talk trash about chucky.... but anyway this is a great buy if you like horror/dark comedies!"
4,good set,"Keep in mind that you can buy the original for like 10 bucks at walmart so you really can't complain about it not being included.i do think the original was the best while many complained of it being boring but it was the origin of how it all begin so it just wasn't as fast paced. the first sequel was good but by the second one the series started to get dry but bride of chucky redeemed the series. all in all, if you enjoyed the first one you should enjoy the entire series as a whole."
3,You Can't Keep A Good Guy Down,"First off I was a lil disappointed that the first one wasn't in the box.. But I picked it up brand new for $5 so it wasn't that big of a deal. Child's Play 2 was fairly decent. 3 However... Well let's not go there. I haven't sat thru that one since I saw it in theaters.. I'll give it another watch eventually. Bride of Chucky wasn't a great movie but it was fun. Chucky and his comments make the movie worth watching. Jennifer Tilly's not bad either ;)I want to know why people really feel the need to bash Chucky? I think he's better to watch than Michael Myers (Halloween), Pin Head (Hellraiser) & Jason Vorhees (Friday the 13th)Chucky = ratings."
5,THE BEST HORROR MOVIE OF EM ALL,Child's play 2 was pretty cool when i first saw it in 2000 but i asked my dad if we could go rent child's play 3 for dvd on my birthday when I turn 10 i'm 9 now but i saw the movie and it kicked [behind]I thought it was the best movie i've ever seen sense 2001 i loved all the child's play movies i thought the bride of chucky was one of the best ones child's play 3 is my favorite like there's a few gory parts in it but still it's pretty awsome and sweet child's play 2 there's a part where he came out of thee teachers closet and takes a pump and pumps her away and she hits the kids desks and comes out with a ruler and whackes her with it and child's play 3 that one has some hella sweet parts child's play was a little gory but all of em rock

4,Bag book,Some good ideas for bags. Not sure about some of them but I will read it and pass it on to others.
3,Okay,This is a durable product that does enhance the look of your vehicle however they are a little smaller framed than the factory ones. I looked for this product to be a little more bulky. Over all this is an ok product.
3,Back rest sags,"After quite a bit of research and comparison, I bought the C5 instead of the Maclaren Triumph because of the better recline feature, price and leg rest.BUT, after using it once or twice, the support inside the backrest seemed to bend and curve, providing no support for my 11 month old. He is all slumped over when he rides in it, especially when the seat is fully upright. When it's fully reclined, it's not a problem.Not sure if this is an isolated incident or what, but Chicco customer serices is GREAT. They are sending me a new stroller to replace it.Great stroller in every other way."
3,Looks stylish but not for me,"We bought this stroller to travel internationally and we thought it did a fair job. We love the way it looks and the large tires make it easy to handle all types of road conditions. However, I am 5'4"" and found the handles were a little too tall for me to push comfortably for long periods of time. There is no bar across the front to strap toys to. The basket is difficult to access when the seat is reclined all the way down. It is also next to impossible to steer this stroller with one hand, a necessity when you have a baby in the stroller and the hand of a toddler to hold. We were ""fortunate"" in the sense that the airline crushed our stroller beyond repair and we replaced it with a Graco Mosiac which we absolutely love with no complaints."
3,Wes Craven Is At It Again,"Wes Craven once again proves he is one of the best horror director's in history. By making this one. This movie has a lot of action in it, and a lot of gore. The two people who own the house, make it creepy. Especially when the man runs around the house with his shotgun. The people under the stairs were the best part of the movie. They were cannibals with their tongues cut off, and they needed to survive.This movie is worth renting for any true horror fan. Especially a Wes Craven fan."
2,Doesn't age well,"I thought this movie was made in the 80's when I recently watched it, but low and behold its early 90's (although an arguement can be made that early 90's is still the 80's). Anyway, I rented this a couple nights ago after reading other amazon reviews about how this movie is so terrifying and so on... I'm afraid I can't agree. Now maybe I've just been spoiled with such good horror such as 28 days later and the ring, but this movie did not age well. I think it completely falls apart when the kid goes BACK to the house after escaping to rescue that girl. I found myself saying... ""no movie, please end, don't go back to the house! I don't want to sit through another half-hour!"" The mom and dad were pretty annoying. The comedy fell on its face most of the time..."
2,"Corny, Not Scary","This isn't a scary horror movie. This is a niche, corny horror movie. It gives the impression it was a made-for-television production. Just not my type of movie, but some may like it."
3,Get in where you fit in,Outrageously well made movie about a boy and some bad guys who break into a house which belongs to a psycho couple that keep a bunch of mutant children in their basement and can't find their way out. Not perfect but an odd delivery by Craven. One of his best thus far. Future cast member of MY SO-CALLED LIFE plays an abused girl.
4,WICKED IN EVERY WAY ...,This movie is one of the most wicked movies I have ever seen. From the begining all the way to the ending with plenty of blood and action in between. If you like a good freaky twisted movie this is diffinately for you.
4,Cool Movie,"Cool movie, interesting theory about having to kill someone for someone else to come back. Somewhat predictable, but still worth watching."
5,Everybody needs to see this movie!!,"This great movie is about a boy from the ghetto, fool, who needs to find money to pay for rent and his grandmother's surgery. Upon hearing about gold in a haunted house that the landlord owns, Fool quickly decides to break in and take his share. This is a great comedy that will make you laugh until you hurt. Great one-liners add to this movie. Even scary movie-haters will love this one. See it."
3,Wes Craven's best movie,"After that disaster called ""Shocker"", Wes Craven directs this darkly humorous suburban dark horror-comedy. A boy living in the ghetto needs tons of money to help his sick mother and he gets his uncle and his uncle's friend to help him steal money hidden under the stairs of their landlords house and soon he discovers that the couple keep people under their house. A very well-made horror flick from the 90s with a good cast,good director, and a well-written storyline. The atmosphere and the house are equally creepy and the couple of the household are bizarre. One of Wes Craven's best movie."
5,"The best horror film by Wes Craven, unless there is a sequel","A 13yr old Boy and some of his sisters, boyfriends break into the landlords house, because they have jacked up the price of the payments to the apartments they live in. Only to find out that nobody has ever succesfully gotten out of the house. After discovering the horrors, and secrets of the house, the boy comes across other problems, a huge rotweiller, a crazy husband who dresses in all black leather with a shotgun shooting at the walls, people trapped in the cell of the basement, an abused girl, and a crazy mother, he fights for his life to escape and to rescue the abused girl. The Best Movie you can with a group of friends."
1,WRONG COUNTRY,I did not realize when I bought this movie it was in th wrong country code. It will not play on my DVD player and was a waste of money....I am so mad the description online did not say it was in German and will not play in America DVD players. WASTE OF MONEY!!!!
2,Good movie. Disc was scratched,"Disc had one deep scratch that prevented me from watching one part of the movie, it would just pause on that part."
3,"""Damn Buckshot!""","I got a real kick out of some of the previous reviews treating ""People Under the Stairs"" as a serious horror film! The thing with this odd movie is that it should be awful...the premise is just so goofy, but somehow things just click and it's just too damn fun! If you like horror-humor, along the lines of the second two Evil Dead films or Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2, then you will enjoy ""People Under the Stairs"". You can't treat this film seriously, if you go into this movie expecting to be scared or frightened you are going to be sorely disappointed. There really are no tense scenes, and anytime the film approaches anything the may be deemed as frightening, something so absurd will happen that you will be smiling immediately. This movie is quite a bit of fun, just don't take it too seriously."
4,Under the stairs-underrated,"This is a great movie. It has everything you can want for a horror movie,gore,action,comedy,suspense. There is no nudity,well no need for it. Just picture a couple(man and woman) who are cannibals with a bunch of kids they kidnapped living in their basement. They kill anyone woh comes by the house and feed them to the kids. They have a scene(which may disturb some) that they show the gutting of a human being. so if you have a week stomach then you may not enjoy this. but it's not that bad. My dad hates horror movies but enjoyed this one. Of course it's not for everyone. my advice is always this: RENT BEFORE YOU BUY!"
3,I wasn't that impressed,"I bought this movie because my sister loves it. I had never seen it before so I watched it with her. I was not impressed at all by the movie. For one thing the special effects were lacking in my book. I guess they were good at the time the movie was made. The blood was too fake looking for me. Another thing, I am not into horror movies at all. The good thing about it was it was not scary. Did I mention I don't do scary.To me the only good thing about the movie was Ving Rhames and as always the bad guys got what was coming to them."
4,Wes Craven Does It Again!,I liked this movie and found it to be pretty scary and slightly disturbing. Watch it in the dark and you'll appreciate it even more.
5,Gackt and Chachamaru Rock!!!,"In spite of these songs being soundtracks for a computer game (Dirge of Ceberus, which I don't even play), I purchased this cd because it's Gackt and I wasn't the least bit sorry. This CD does in only 4 songs (two of which are instrumental) what some bands can't even do with a full CD's worth of material, and that's saying something.Gackt's vocals are just blistering here, and showcases his incredible range. However, the real treat here is his guitarist, Chachamaru, who just smokes! On 'Longing', Chacha goes full-on ballistic, delivering scorching licks that any metal guitarist would envy (and I hear he's got a solo album). I especially love the instrumental versions of 'Redemption' and 'Longing' where I get to really hear Chacha's talent.Not to mention that Chacha is another extremely sexy bishonen male...an added bonus.This CD is also getting heavy rotation on the old MP3 and is a great way to start even the dreariest of days. It's powerful, heady stuff from Gackt."
5,LUV GACKT,I LUVE GACKT AND THIS IS JUST GOOD. IT HAS BOTH SONGS HE DID FOR THE GAME AND THE INSTRUMENTALS SO ITS REALLY GOOD.
3,THE USUAL WELLES FARE,"I would rather watch Welles on his WORST day than any other director on their best.Arkadin follows Welles downward,self destructive spiral that seemed to grip him from the 60's through til his death in 85.The muddled plot along with the mis cast lead role turn what could have been compaired to KANE and THE TRIAL and instead present us with a Flawed piece with flashes of typical Welles genius.Bugdet restraints along with long gaps between filming wouldnt help and I suppose the fact that the film was released at all should be enough,its just that we all know what he was capable of,and it was more than this."
1,Poor quality ruins the experience,"I am referring to the Laser Light dvd edition of this film, which promises the best digital transfer of the film. That is great, but they used the worst print anyone could concieve to transfer! I taped this off of television awhile back and decided to buy a dvd version and this is 100 times worse than the version I taped myself on the slowest speed off of late night tv! In reading other reviews it appears that there is a much better VHS version and I would recommend that over this. Do not be fooled like I was with the fine condition of Welles' ""The Trial"" by Laser Light or the pipe smoking picture packaging of this. This version of Arkardin is a total waste of money."
2,Lesser Welles Movie,"Welles gathered up his own money to make this, something of a European ""Citizen Kane."" It's an overblown mess, due probably to the fact that the distributor pulled it out of Welles' hands and butchered it.Robert Arden plays Guy Van Stratten, a man hired by Mr. Arkadin (Welles, sporting heavy makeup and an awful performance) to dig up some info about his past (Arkadin is suffering from amnesia, you see). However, when Van Stratten goes out to interview people, they all turn up dead. SUSPENSE!The DVD looks exceptionally poor, mastered from terrible source material. But being an independantly financed Welles film, I'll assume there was little better in the way of source material. The distortion of the score is inexscusable, however.As in most Laserlight 'Special Edition Classics,' a black-gloved Tony Curtis gives an introduction. Here, he rambles on about ""Citizen Kane"" and mispronounces the title of ""Mr. Arkadin."" There is also a trailer for ""Citizen Kane."""
1,Appauling Quality,"This is a potentially very good film. Interesting idea (bearing some resemblance to ""Angel heart""). Sadly marred by a quite appauling transfer. I don't think I've ever bought (DVD or video) or seen (TV or cinema) quite such an awful copy of a movie. It is clearly stuck together from more than one original, with the logo ""Delta"" appearing now and again in the bottom right hand corner, but don't be misled into thinking this is the most complete version. The term ""special edition"" seems to refer only to the fact that it has been released !!!!! Tony Curtis does an incredibly poor intro and epilogue (clearly from some late night cheap TV series).Don't buy it.Maybe there's a better version (I read talk of a ""Critereon"" disc), maybe not. Still, it really isn't worth (any) money."
1,Itz about DVD not movie,The quality of the DVD is so horrible... The picture is not even clear in many parts... I couldnt' watch it... Dont' waste your money on this DVD.. Buy another version of this movie...
1,Great package... dull film,"I'm a huge Orson Welles fan and actually regret making this public knowledge - but I hated this film. I was excited to crack open the beautiful packaging and quickly fell into a disappointing episode of feeling really dumb that I just didn't get it. The photography was classic Welles - the acting was something out of a bad rehersal at an insane asylum. Don't get caught up in having to like it, just because it's Welles - it's ok to go against the grain and declare to the world - this movie blows."
1,Criterion now giving credit to Welles poor (old)excuses,"The Criterion Collection, a continuing series of important classic and contemporary films, is dedicated to gathering the greatest films from around the world and publishing them in editions that offer the highest technical quality and award-winning, original supplements.The foundation of the collection is the work of such(real) MASTERS of cinema as Renoir, Godard, Kurosawa, Cocteau, Fellini, Bergman, Tarkovsky, Hitchcock, Fuller, Lean, Kubrick, Lang, Sturges, Dreyer, Eisenstein, Ozu, Sirk, Bunuel, Powell and Pressburger.The Criterion Collection must feel embarrassed for wasting a tremendous amount of time in this glorious package to glorify the most incompetent of all filmmakers. I did not watch any of the extras, but I hope you can find there those hilarious TV- clips from the 70s with Welles crying like a baby....""Oh...They only let me do the movie I wanted to make in Kane...."""
3,Terrible quality but a must-see for the Welles aficionado,"The shocking audio and visual quality makes it incredibly difficult to watch, but it's a classic piece of Welles history, so I put up with it. The Tony Curtis intro alone is worth the price of admission!"
1,Somebody save this poor film!,"Okay, I am a fan of Welles, and believe that all of his films should be released in the most pristine perfect version possible. So to watch this monstrosity of a DVD pained me more than anything. I couldn't enjoy the film because the limitations of the disc were so annoying. First off, this is not a clean print. The image looks horrid and the sound is not much better. Laserlight really just dumped the picture and ran. Is the film good? Yeah, it's not his best film, but it's still entertaining. But I'll pick up another copy sometime when a company that cares about it releases it. This versions cheap becuase it's not very good."
5,Five strong strong stars,"Dis is the most played CD in my CD collection (it is a very small collection, but powerful) I LOVE Israel Vibration, and dis is the best CD to me."
5,"Classic roots, rock, reggae--not to be missed","""Unconquered People"" provides an excellent sample of classic roots, rock, reggae music at its best. The three members of Israel Vibration are one of the greatest, if not the greatest, vocal harmony trios in the history of reggae music--which is saying a lot. The backing band on this CD is a veritable who's who of all time great reggae musicians. Not to be missed."
3,Exciting,"Although this book was written back in the sixties, it is still exciting. Could the bubonic plague really hit America?"
5,"""Even the Smallest Person...""","Do you ever feel insignificant, or that your little life doesn't make a difference? Well, ""Meet Solanus Casey""! His life proved that even the smallest person among us can change the world by just being himself. Born of poor Irish farmers, Solanus (Barney) did so poorly in his studies for the priesthood that he merely attained ""simplex"" status. In his latter years, 400 people a day would line up to counsel with him - so great was his love and his impact on his fellow man. Be inspired by the love of this little friar and believe that you, too can change the world."
3,Disappointing...but not horrible,"I was struck by the beauty of Dido's voice when No Angel came out..I loved the beats that complimented her singing so wonderfully. I rushed out to buy Life for Rent expecting more of the same. I didn't get what I wanted.While not a horrible album, it's just okay. Nothing stands out, nothing repeats in my head once I've turned it off. I would definitely use it for background music, though. It is beautiful and mellow - very subtle all the way through.However, I was looking for more."
3,I liked No Angel better...,"Dido's voice is amazing, it's true. However, the songs on this album are somewhat forgettable. I do like ""White Flag"" and ""Life for Rent,"" but can't really remember any of the other ones. There's some techno-hip-hoppie thing that doesn't suit the song itself... and a mix of other music styles that don't seem to meld well."
5,Hauntingly beautiful voice!!!,"I have to say that Dido's Freshman album ""No Angel"" is one of those CD's you just never get tired of. I literally have worn it out and am sure to do the same with her Sophmore album ""Life for Rent"". More subdued songs this time, but same great voice. I agree with the other reviewers Dido is underrated. She stands out among today's artists. Even Eminem thinks so!!!!Perfect CD for work, home, car and where-ever!!! Hope we don't have to wait four more years for another great Dido album!"
4,Life for rent,"The lyrics are amazing. It's not a ""fast"" cd, the music is quite slow, but this makes it unique.Some songs have an incredible imagination....like ""mary's in India""...it's a beautifull story, and it's also very real...that's what I like of this CD, the lyrics are REAL, they say thing that happend to all of us in some point of our lifes.I apollogise if this is not well written, but i'm from ARGENTINA and I'm still learning English...I hope that you can understand this text.Buy dido's new cd...is great, really."
2,Slow,"I really love Dido's ""No Angel"" CD, but unfortunately ""Life For Rent"" fails to live up to the standards set by ""No Angel"". In my oppinion the tracks all blend together, and are pritty boring sounding. I dont really hear much of the passion in Dido's voice like we hear in 'Here with me' on ""No Angel"". ""White Flag"" IS a good song, as is ""See The Sun"", besides these two tracks, the rest is fall asleep to music - nothing really special to say the least.If you like what you have heared on the radio by Dido, your probably best to get ""No Angel"". If your looking for slow background music ""Life For Rent"" is perfect! If you want to listen to a great female artist try ""Liz Phair"" by Liz Phair, much better :-)"
5,Excellent,"Very simple, well written, well produced and well sung album. She has a great voice and doesn't try to go where her voice won't take her."
5,A lot of Ambienz,Very cool. Life for Rent represents a new statement in electronica and global music. The second release from DIDO.
2,Please don't buy this album,"Although not a massive fan of the first album, I can truthfully say that I enjoyed the two singles Thank You, Here With Me, and especially the last track on the album - My Life, which had a fresh urgent feel to it.As for Life For Rent, it has great production, a nice beat & all manner of nice spacey acoustic-y sounds. So 'what's the problem?' you say.Well, to be honest, There's nothing particularly ""offensive"" about this album, but that's the problem - it's in no way challenging. It's just, well... bland. The lyrics are pointless, the melodies are overly naive and easily forgotten, and the chord changes just plain uninspired.If you want a good bit of background music, do yourself a favour and buy this album, but personally I'd recommend something with a bit more flair like Gillian Welch's Revival."
3,Well...it's not original but...,"It is...well right down the line...boring but safe. I don't love it but I like it. I definitely agree that Tori Amos puts this cd in the garbage so to speak but Life for Rent still has some qualities, such as Dido's voice herself. Yeah if you like metal you're going to probably yawn but if you like alt. rock or folk, or contemporary (gag) adult, this is an album you can go with."
4,Great Cd!,Dido has done it again! She brings hope to the rest of the meaningless music out there today.
5,Her Best Album Yet!,I was lisening to 104 for so long just to hear White Flag! Well done Dido! Its perfect in every way!
2,"What happened here? There's not even ""Life for free"" :(","I was so excited to pick up this CD, after hearing her debut No Angel...after listening I left wondering ""What Happened?"".I really love Dido's voice, but the material on this album is dreadful - that's right, dreadful!! I listened to White Flag and thought, ehhh...this is ok...then I realized this was her first single from this album and then thought...Uh Oh. My fears came true as I listened on. This disc has no spirit. Listen closely to her vocals throughout the whole CD - it's nearly monotone. Sad to say, I really didn't have any favorites on this disc and will probably let it sit in my CD collection, unlistened to, or sell it.I do have one question though, ""Dido, did you do this or did Arista records do this?""."
2,It was too similar and still lacking,I found this CD a disappointment. The meandering lyrics and melodies in most of the songs just didn't carry me. This is an example of why it is better to buy a track rather than a CD. The background track was really uninspiring in an age when music is so easily built into the song.
3,Been there and heard that.,There are a couple songs worth listening to but I feel that there is a lack of lyrical development in the rest and the mix leaves alot to be desired. I enjoyed See the Sun and Life for Rent but would not listen to this album over and over again.
5,AWESOME ALBUM,"Life for rent is another awesome album by Dido. It is a bit more laid back than ""No Angel"" but in my opinion, I think that makes it better. Her soft calming vocals really suit the music. Its just great to listen to it while your driving in your car or even while your sleeping or taking a nap. Highly recommended!! A must have album for both dido fans and non dido fans. Go buy one now! hehe."
5,Awesome Voice!,"If you love DIDO's 1st CD you will like ""Life For Rent"", ALthough I have to agree that her new cd has more slow songs then the 1st, its still a great CD. My favorite on this album is ""White Flag"", ""Dont Leave Home"" & ""Sand In My Shoes"". Overall DIDO has an amazing voice and even if I cant relate to some of her song lyrics the music and her voice is relaxing. Cant wait for the 3rd!"
4,Enjoying this,"I am really enjoying this CD. The songs are catchy. It's a little different from the other CD I have, No Angel, it seems more upbeat."
1,Dido bribes fans for good press,"Dido's fanclub is offering prizes to those individuals who post the best and most reviews on various websites. I don't think this review will win an autographed pic or free cd, but frankly I don't care. Anyone with the ability to hear can attest to the fact that ""Life for Rent"" is a mundane, boring collection of pathetic, whinny ditties. The music is so whimpy that I'm embarrassed to own the cd. The melodies are bland, the music is redundant and the vocals are lax. The first single, White Flag sounds like elevator music. The most ironic aspect of this cd is the copy protection. Dido has no problem begging her fans for good press, but she blocks those who may have wanted to transfer the disc to their computer, mp3 player, or even to an interested friend. Dido appears greedy, this cd is the biggest sell-out I've ever seen."
2,What happened to Dido?,"My God, what happened to Dido? I love No Angel to death but I can't bear listening to this CD. Gone are the mesmerizing rhythms found in Don't Think of Me and I'm No Angel. Every song on here is the exact same. It's as if she's speaking with some (entirely too heavy) background beats humming along. There are no ups and downs to her voice. If it wasn't for the fact that words are spoken at different speeds, you can imagine her chanting the lyrics. I can't believe this is Dido has to offer after these years. Hopefully her next album is better. I will be waiting."
2,Some Remixes Please,"I received this CD as a gift from my boyfriend a few months ago and while I thought the songs were nice, I wasn't completely blown away. Everything was a little TOO loungey and where were the dance tunes?I wouldn't go see Dido in concert because I probably would just fall asleep after the fifth song or so. She doesn't have the voice to capture your attention and keep it for very long."
4,Great Sophomore Effort,"Life For Rent is a good, moody, introspective piece of work from Dido. Her vocals still ring true and full and the lyrics and melodies are familiar and comforting. Another nice addition if you already own No Angel. It will be interesting to see what remixes come of this effort. Eminem, have you heard it yet?"
4,Great Set,"I enjoy this album time and time again. I think this one takes second place to No Angel, but still a great set of music."
2,"Dull, where is her brother ? Not as good as the first.","I'm reading the good reviews but I don't get it...this is sleepy, dull and no ""hook"" to it. One or two good songs and thats it. Definitly not as good as the last. Her brother (Faithless), is a genius - where is his influence on this? If you are expecting the same ""catchiness"" and full of ""content"" as the last, you may have to really dig deep, I can't find it. And, I really dig her too. (Plus, this cd? It's everywhere in the used bins already-dirt cheap. That says something.)"
1,What's the point?,"Why to release the copycat of the first, somehow original album which included some really haunting tunes (Hunter comes to mind)? Except the leading single, each piece here is boring to death and smells cheap inspirations. I have respect for Dido at least she is a songwriter and she shows from time to time that she has talent but milking the cows with a cheap follow-up is not the best way to use that talent.I hope she tries something different hnext time (whatever that may be except a third copycat) or she will be forgotten soon in this over-speed century."
2,Average at Best,"Somewhere Between Suzanna Vega,Sarah Maclaughlin,Sinead O'Connor&Norah Jones you find Dido.She is Safe vocally&has the voice that Adult Format Radio just enjoys playing over&over again.the Material here is farily safe&doesn't stray from Her Formula.She is very middle of the road already&that isn't a good thing."
4,Excactly what you'd expect...,"and that's just fine with me. I'm a fan of her first record and this one is just as good. Great lyrics, great production. Great voice."
4,excellent,"i actually got my hands on this album before the release, and haven't put it down one single day. I have never been a strong Dido fan but this album has made me one.dido is a very creative singer. her lyrics are awesome.. my favs include ""do you have a little time"" which is so catchy, well written and sung, along with ""sand in my shoes"" and of course the title track ""life for rent"" that is filled with more CREATIVE cliches. least favs are ""see you when you're 40"" and Mary's in india"" don't like em.. hence, why the 4 stars..but regardless.. this IS an album you'll want to buy a legit copy of. bravo"
4,The real thing,"Why is this album so excellent? Simply because Dido takes her audience, and her artistic efforts, seriously. The lyrics are not just ""I love you, blablabla"", but attemps to grasp some of the more complex aspects of human emotions in an honest, uncompromising way. As a listener, I am very convinced that the words sprung from the very depths of Didos heart and soul. Musically the album covers many genres and is full of original ideas, and I think this isn't only due to ""collaborating with the right people"". Music, and art as such, should be dealing with subjects beyond the banal discrepancies between the sexes, and try to convey honest emotions and reflections to an audience who should expect no less. All hail Dido, she's for real."
3,Pretty,"Life for Rent is pretty. They are lovely songs, in the smokey, folky, electronic pop that Dido does very nicely. But this album is full of songs in the laid-back pop, subtly bouncy vein of ""Thank You"" and ""Isobel."" It's not broken up with ""bigger"" songs...nothing approaching ""Here With Me,"" ""Take My Hand,"" or ""Hunter"" on this album, unfortunately."
4,:-),"I'm surprised the previous ""critic"" was impassioned enough to spend as much time as he did, moaning on and on..."
3,"Okay, I Guess....","A good record, but if you already own the first one, don't bother with this, it's almost a duplicate. Sorry Dido, I like you, but I expected a little more."
2,Some vocals are beautiful,There are some really beautiful vocals on this CD but there are also some really dull vocals and the entire feel of the track just loses it for me. I liked the White Flag vocals but found the hook a little wimpy conceptually. It was an overplayed concept. The songs do not stay in my head or inspire me after the CD is done and I do not have the urge to put it back on again.
5,Delicious,"Dido's new album, Life for Rent, is an extraordinarily honest look at love and heartbreak. She raises the bar and allows the listener to face the reality of her (their) experiences with the hearts' dark side. Dido's words and music are joyous, immensely sad, and always soulful. After listening to Life for Rent I may never allow myself to fall in love again, that is, if I can resist the sheer emotionality she portrays so honestly. This is the best album I've heard in years. Bravo, Dido!"
3,Give it a few listens,"Watching DIDO perform white flag on the new Ellen Degeneres show is what inspired me to buy her new album. But after my first listening to the CD I was pretty disapointed. But after listening to it a few times I have really grown to like it. There is nothing groundbreaking in it, but overall I think its a decent addition to my collection. Its best when used in a CD changer when playing random songs from various different CD's rather than listening to the whole CD alone. It could tend to get a little old. Bottom line there are songs on here that im glad I get to hear. I really like Sand in my shoes, Stoned, See you when your 40, dont leave home.....oh hell, they are all ok,."
3,"Good sophomore album, but not as good as the firts one","If you're looking for this album to be ""No Angel"" part 2 you're in for a big surprise. Although she's kept her style the music in ""Life for Rent"" is more mellow. I consider this album to be very slow. The songs that I like are: White Flag, Stoned, Life for Rent, Sand in my Shoes, See the Sun and Don't leave home (this being my favorite along with White Flag). The rest of the songs are pretty slow. Good album, but the first one was a little more energetic."
2,Up-Beat and Good for Any Mood,"Didnt listen much to Dido but fell in love with 'White Flag' on the radio... She has some great lyrics, and alot of her songs have very catchy tunes. (1)White Flag, (6)Dont Leave Home, (7)Who Makes You Feel, (11) See the Sun. Anyway, hope you enjoy it... I sure do ;)"
4,hypnotic female voices,"a lovely album with hypnotic vocals and lyrics that are gradually evolving into something substantial. Though I'm mystified that most of those who love Enya and Dido never really gave Cocteau Twins a chance, I must say that I, too, have been swept up by these ethereal ""pop"" sounds (which at least offer more than most of the other stuff on American radio).For female vocals that continue to move the soul, I also recommend Sarah Brightman, Lisa Gerrard & PJ Harvey."
4,Pure Emotion,"I was not a fan of Dido until the Life for Rent CD came out. At the point where the lyrics to more than one song may as well have been hand written by myself, her songs hit a chord with me. I think that's the key to her music, relating to it. The beats behind her cool soothing voice are beautiful. Granted, there are other CDs with greater impact, but Life for Rent strikes at deep emotions with an honesty not always heard or felt in modern music."
3,If i could rent it instead i would be happy,"Dido's second album is very nice, the hit songs a wonderful, emotional and very well written. Dido's a song writer of high class, rare poetical lyrics that will be hard to find from the average artist, sometimes however i feel like the lyrics are better then the songs itself. I didn't know if i should give a 2 or 3, 2'5 would be better suited perhaps. ""White flag"" and ""Life for rent"" are songs you simply cannot dislike, when you've heard them a few times they're stuck on you. ""Don't leave home"" is the 3th really good song on this album, slow emotional and well written. ""Stones"" a trip hop song, after all she had a past with Faithless. A decent song, probably a upcoming single. The other songs are passable though, almost all of them slow and simular, good lyrics but not so interesting. A decent album."
4,SOPHOMORE SUCSESS,"- ""No Angel"" is still the better work- Strong Dido styled with a cherry on top- She crosses genres like a champ- Will please all ages- Vocals were great- All the songs were not as ""embellishing"" or ""meaty""- ""White Flag"" is the favored Strong-Song- Good sequencing, but very basic almost boring- Lyrical content: Strong, Clever, full of relationship talk- Production: top notch- Performances: top notch- Worth purchasing and listening to over and over!<OTHER RECOMMENDED ALBUMS SIMILAR-GENRA WORTH PURCHACING>No AngelA Rush of Blood to the HeadFumbling Towards EcstasyFallen From GraceTales of a Librarian"
2,ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ,"Give it up, Dido...It's been done before, and much better...Her name is Sarah McLachlan -by the way, don't try so hard to copy her mesmerizingm haunting voice cause it just DOESNT WORK!!!"
2,WHITE FLAG BY DIDO (LIFE FOR RENT CD),"I only have webtv and not a computer.The sound clips I've heard from different companies(AMAZON INCLUDED) are SO BRIEF,I really don't get to hear enough of the song to rate it.I realize you can't play the WHOLE THING!,but you could play ONE MINUTE where I could really hear enough to actually RATE the song.I WILL say AMAZON'S sound quality is better than most but they are JUST AS STINGY as all the others!What FEW seconds I heard were good I guess but it wasn't nearly LONG ENOUGH...SHAME ON YOU! My rating of 2 stars is for it's briefness.I'm sure if I could hear ENOUGH,it would have been a 5!"
1,Life for Rent by Dido,"A more accurate name for this highly overrated popstar is Dild0. She has the most monotonous, idiotic, and british accented voice ever. The first single, White Flag, represents this entire mess easily. I would reccomend that only people who like Modest Mouse invest in this british crap.and the grand total rating...0 stars!"
1,Mellow and manufactured,"She just goes on and on and on. Could somebody ask her to stop and get on with her life! A middle class dancing queen from Islington, a role-model for all those nice 30-somethings working in the City, who really always wanted to work in the music industry- because it is so hip and because they've once learned to play the piano- but never actually had the courage to as it is so very difficult to give up the lifestyle. And Financial Times. And the prospect of a banker-husband. So now they buy this cd instead. Safe and booooring."
5,Great Music,"This is an excellent CD. Dido's voice vibrates with intelligence and sensitivity and with an aware passion that is all too rare these days. The album is impeccably produced, making it a joy to listen to.Some songs - White Flag, Who Makes You Feel, Life for Rent - I liked immediately. Others, especially Mary's in India and Stoned, grew up on me and are now my favorites."
4,And a Half Stars,"Excellent album, not quite as good as the first one, so I took away a star, but I'm already feeling guilty about it.I saw Dido live some months ago. She's pure energy, her voice is magical and wonderful and beautiful and sexy and ""wow"".There's already enough reviews about this album, so I shan't go into detail, if you liked the first one, you'll most likely like this one too. If you haven't listened to the first album, you're missing out.Compared to most stuff out there, this is a five, but I don't want to over sell it."
3,Is This Life For Rent?,"Firstly & Foremost...this album is not as good as ''No Angel''. It's over average -but it's not beyond average like ''No Angel'' was....it does however feature some good moments on tracks like ''Life For Rent'', ''White Flag'', ''See The Sun'' and ''See When You're 40''. More or less, the album does not possess the same powerful stream as ''No Angel'' breathed. Her voice is still beautiful in its tuned form. It's the kind of voice that gives absolute perfection, I only know one other performer who can be compared to Dido and that is Tracy Thorn (From Everything But The Girl). Both Dido or Tracy Thorn could sing about ''laundry detergent'' as someone else put it, and they'd still make it sound incredible. That shows you, how incredible both of them are.And I will give this album 5 stars, the songs are average standard except for the excellent title track and her voice still sounds great!. This artist will get really far, mark my words."
5,"Even Better Than ""No Angel""","Dido's second album contains no less than 4 big radio hits ( ""White Flag"", ""Life For Rent"", ""Don't Leave Home"" and ""Sand in My Shoes"" ) and at least one or two more are potential hit singles. Dido has a voice than can easily be distinguised from the majority of the female pop-singers of today. ( a little Dusty Springfield and a little Suzanne Vega ). Most of her songs have catchy hooks and moving lyrics.There are simply so many great songs on this album that it even surpasses her much-acclaimed first album ""No Angel""; well that was was I used to think. Now I realize that this isn't really possible. ""No Angel"" is a masterpiece; ""Life For Rent"" is ""just"" an extraordinary great album!Can't wait for her new album!My favourites here are, ""White Flag"", ""Life For Rent"", ""Mary's in India"", ""Don't Leave Home"", ""This Land is Mine"" and ""See the Sun"" - Don't miss the hidden track ""Closer""!"
5,A Very Pleasant Surprise!,"I bought this CD just for one song, ""White Flag."" Boy, was I in for a treat. This album is simply fantastic. There is really only one song that I don't care for ""Do You Have a Little Time,"" but the rest are great listening.My favorite is ""Don't Leave Home;"" the melodies and deep bass reel me in on that one.I am now a Dido fan! It's nice to have some real music."
4,Dido acoustic,"Dido returns with ""Life For Rent"", the follow-up to her debut album ""No Angel"". Similar to it's predecessor, some tracks on the new album jump out immediately while the few others are leftovers. The standouts are ""White Flag"", the title track ""Life For Rent"", ""See You When You're 40"", ""Sand In My Shoes"", and the incredible album finish ""See The Sun"". Many of the tracks are an unlayered Dido singing over drum loops, accompanied by just keyboards and/or an acoustic guitar. There is also a 'hidden' track. See The Sun ends about 5:00 into track 11, and at about 7:04 another song begins."
4,Solid Sophmore Outing,"Dido gets major points for consistency, not the greatest vocalist, fair writing skills and yet she understands her skills well enough to maximize her abilities. The music here is very solid and consistent with her last outing. The writing again is fair enough to give some good stories for the music to support. Dido is great background fare and I do means this as a compliment. Sometimes, you need music and vocalists who work well behind the scenes of everyday life not as the focus, ladies and gentlemen I give you Dido."
4,"Equally as good as her first, if not better...","Her lyrics prove once again looks are deceiving, she is no angel... My fave track is ""White Flag""... Her and Sarah McLachlan are two peas in a pod so to speak who have made it somewhat successfully in alternative music listening crowds as well as mainstream... I believe it's because they both have talent, and are putting out music they believe in... If you enjoyed ""No Angel"" you'll enjoy this one as much if not more - so go out and buy it - Savannah Skye..."
4,Enjoyable,"Dido delivers again. While this is not quite a 5 star album, it suffices. Dido, the sultry Euro-rocker spins out some sweet tunes on this CD. Good for the women in your life for Christmas, or your metrosexual male friends. Dido has a spunk to her that carries through in her music, this album is no exception. B+Joseph Dworak"
4,A Very Relaxing and Good Work,"Dido's latest CD is a very relaxing and soothing work. Her voice has matured and it shows through perfectly. Get this CD if you want one to relax or chill to some music. It's not for a person looking for upbeat music. (Though Sand In My Shoes is) The reason I didn't give it a full 5 is because a couple songs sound pretty similar which is never a great thing. (Especially with how much money they have you pay for CD's these days!) However, this is worth checking out."
3,Great,"Like 'No Angel', 'Life for Rent' is the kind of album that takes a few listens to appreciate. At first listen, it may sound boring and bland, but the songs really grew on me after a few listens. There are suble electronic sounds here and there but the whole album sounds more organic than 'No Angel'. And Dido's vocal is still one of a kind when compared to her contemporaries. Her voice is melancholy but warm at the same time. Her vocal drives the songs but it's not overbearing and she never oversings like the other 'divas'."
4,The British version of Sarah McLaughlin,"While she is no Sarah McLaughlin, British export Dido does a pretty good job of trying to come close. On her new album, ""Life For Rent"", she continues her introspective standard. This cd seems to be a little more upbeat than her first release, ""No Angel"". There are several radio-friendly tracks here....especially the current single ""White Flag"", ""See The Sun"", ""Sand In My Shoes"", and ""Don't Leave Home"". ""Don't Leave Home"" tends to be my favorite. Her voice sounds really great on this track and the music is loud enough to give her a good backing sound. Apart from the main tracklisting, there is an extra bonus song embedded behind ""See The Sun""....so make sure to keep playing after that one is over!If the radio doesn't tire us of Dido as they did with the few singles from ""No Angel"", I think people will really appreciate this album....and will play it on those rainy days when they good chill-out music to match the dreary mood."
2,Could be much better,"I will be one of the few who writes a negative review for this album, and I consider myself a Dido fan. Her debut album was wonderful. Therefore, I expected some great new stuff in this one. There is very little to none at all. No new ideas, no experimentation, no pushing the limits, not variety. Great filler material but nothing compared to her first work. Welcome to the world of commercial success, where you have to push creativity aside to keep the dough flowing. Dido decided to play it safe and remain very Dido'esque on this one. Yes, she is original; yes, she has special sound, but too much of it twice in a row gets a bit boring. Some nice Dido-like tunes, but no serious work here. Move along. Even the hyped White Flag is nothing special. Do yourself a favor and get it for $1 at iTunes."
5,Excellent CD,I've purchased quite a few new albums lately and this is by far the best one. There is a song for every mood in this CD. Definitely a must buy!
4,"""Cool to be sad.""","Life for Rent by Dido is just worth buying for three tracks, the first single, White Flag and the delriously good Stoned and See You when You're 40. The last two songs I mentioned are about 5 minutes each and they are brilliant and her best work to date. The rest of the album is awesome as well, Dido's voice is really soothing and I love her songwriting, very catchy and intelligent. Buy this album today!"
4,Dido - Life for Rent,"During my travels I occasionally heard the song White Flag starting in February of 2007. I found the singer's name and the title of the song, not on the radio - they do not sell records (or CDs) any more. This CD is great and I like most of the songs on it. The singer has a very versatile voice, good writers and a great back up band."
4,Not better than the first but still very good,"Very good for a ""sophomore"" album, since many singers seem to collapse on the second album."
5,Excellent,"Prior to listeneing to the album, i had only heard the one song, White Flag, and i hoped that the rest of the album would match the song. I wasn't dissapointed as Life for Rent is filled with great songs, with a variety that makes this an enjoyable album. Best songs on it, in my opnion, are WHite Flag and Life for Rent."
5,Dido is just as good this time around,"This CD proves without a doubt that Dido is a serious musician. Her music is a deep expression of emotion and it takes time to ""say what she wants to say."" So this time around the wait is worth it because she's saying things she didn't get to say on ""No Angel"". ""White Flag"" is a great song with emotion and great lyrics. ""Life For Rent"" is too. Other songs on this CD that are good are ""Don't Leave Home"", ""Do You Have A Little Time"", and the hidden track that plays right after ""See The Sun"", called ""The Closer You Get"". I recommend this CD to anyone who really enjoys music for music, not for some cheap sing a long or great guitar player. Dido is an artist with music and this is a very entertaining collection of songs. Buy it!"
2,A lackluster sophomore effort.,"I'm very disappointed. I had such hopes for this album-- I was infatuated with No Angel, Dido's first CD, when it came out. There were so many songs that had me addicted to her voice and melodies... But if you're hoping for another ""Here With Me,"" ""Don't Think Of Me"" or ""Take My Hand,"" you won't find it on Life For Rent.These songs seemed very lifeless to me. ""White Flag"" is dreamy enough for my tastes, but the other songs bored me, even the first time through. ""Mary's In India"" seems unfinished, or somehow under-constructed. Songs like ""See You When You're 40"" and ""This Land Is Mine"" are bland and similar-sounding. In fact, many songs on this album sound alike; not in a cohesive way, but in a tedious one.I really wanted to like this album, but it just isn't very worthy."
4,Im a big fan of Dido...,"She's an amazing singer and songwriter. I liked ""life for rent"" but I have to admit that I was a bit disappointed that it didn't have the same flavour as ""no angel"". In this albumn, I feel that Dido has softened her music. Her ability to convey emotions and feeling through her music is still there but I felt that there was a lack of ""edge"" in her music. I kept expecting her to blow me away during a chorus (like how she wailed on ""here with me"" in the last minute of the song. now, THAT was amazing!), but I found myself being let down. However, Im recommending this album to any Dido fan anyway. I love Dido's voice and introspective lyrics. She is a musical genius and even with the softer, somewhat sadder sounds of ""life for rent"", Dido is sure to be a good listen"
3,Space for Rent,"Dido's eponomyous debut No Angel took a while before it set the charts on fire and everyone started hailing her as a trip-hop chanteuse. But while No ANgel was largely enjoyable, it had much to thank for due to Thank You and Here With Me. The rest of the album sounded pretty similar.Come 2003, she's back with Life For Rent. First single, White Flag follows in the vein of Here With Me. The single sets the direction for the CD. Dido takes no risk on Life For Rent but rehashes the successful formula that made her a star in the first place. White Flag is enjoyable by most standards, better than most radio fodder out there these days. A good beat, a catchy chorus and haunting vocals - all the right ingredients for a Dido smash. But elsewhere on the album, the true gems are the title track and the near-closer See The Sun.If you like No Angel Part 2, grab this album. If not, replay No ANgel."
4,"Very smooth, very new, but maybe not fresh enough","We all loved ""Thank You"" from dido on her last album. This album boasts of course the title track ""Life for rent"" and ""white flag"". Both are songs that have a good melody and beat. The album focuses more on acutal sound, than music. When dido sings ""with"" the music. It is definitley a very, very good album, there are just a few tracks that aren't very impressive. Lyrically Dido, is obviously trying to set a theme with this album, what that theme is, is not very clear. It could be her expressed love to an ex- lover. But you have to have your own opinion on that. As I said before, Life For Rent is a good album, but don't expect to be AMAZED when you hear it. It is a very relaxing album that anyone can enjoy."
3,Unrealistically High Expectations?,"I think my expectations for Dido's second album may have been too high, because I was so looking forward to hearing a brand new compilation of ethereal sultry sounds that I feel defined her sound on the No Angel album. I purchased the import version of the No Angel album which has additional tracks, ""Worthless"" being my favorite song by Dido.The Life for Rent album has great music, and many of the songs are growing on me, but initially I was disappointed that each song didn't blow me away on the first listen."
3,Disappointed,"No Angel was one of the best debut albums that I've bought in recent years. Being a fan of Sarah McLachlan, Sinead O'Conner, the personal folksy modern pop angle of Dido was just right up my alley. Now, the followup album seems to extend upon the tried and true formula of the first, but ends up disappointing. The general style is similar, but ultimately disappoints in its predictability, and lack of catchy emotional melodies that defined the first album. The actual lyrics are darker, but most of the songs sound more homogeneous, taking no chances to differentiate themselves. I had this album on repeat in my car, but after listening to it for multiple times, it didn't have the holding power or any standout tracks that had me humming the tune."
4,Dido's Songs Are Beautiful!,"I love how Dido has written an album that is popular-but not bland like some top hits are. She is never afraid of bringing her album into dark places (where I think the album becomes stunningly beautiful. Ex: Do you have a little time and White Flag)her voice is like the reassuring,sublime voice of an angel in the midst of melancholy and love terribly wrong. Her songs aren't silly little jingles that are soon forgotten as the next hyped up baggy pants wearing next big THING comes along. Her songs are about life and it's wear and tear on the soul but her voice is so lovely, so angelic, it holds the promise of a brighter, better tommorow.Also suggested: Eraykuh Baduh (probably spelled wrong), Heart, Stevie Nicks, Tori Amos (all are women who have incredible music and heartfelt songs."
5,Heard Dido on Tarzan...,"I didn't know Dido had come out with a second album and then I heard ""White Flag"" on the WB show Tarzan and ran out to get a copy. I think Dido is one of the most passionate vocalists we have today. Hearing her song fit so perfectly into the romance of the show! I was blown away by it! :)"
2,God awful.,"First published in 1961 as part of the Cool and Lam detective series, Bachelors Get Lonely is little more than 167 pages of mindless drivel. Authored by the legendary Erle Stanley Gardner under the pseudonym A.A.Fair, this book is a monumental disappointment. The plotting is unwieldy, the characters repeatedly insist on doing things completely out of character and the dialogue, more often than not, is laughably inauthentic sounding. Do not waste your time reading Bachelors Get Lonely."
3,General survey of art,"General survey course text. Not too deep, so suitable for high school students of art. The illustrations are so-so. You can find better information on the internet now, so this book is past its prime. I'm going to cut-up my copy for collage works."
5,Great user-friendly guide,"This is one of 3 local hiking guides I have of the area and this is definitely the most user-friendly one. The driving directions were clear and the description of the hikes was acurate and very helpful.The thing I appreciate most with this guide provides was that whether or not there is a fee (parking and/or permit) involved at each hike. By listing who manages each trail, I could avoid arriving at a hike just to find out that I did not have cash to pay for parking or that I should have stop by a local vendor to get a pass/permit.Also, I always take my dog on hikes, so it is good to know the pet regulation at each trail.This is defnitely a must for everyone who lives in the Seattle area and wants to explore the local trails."
3,Needs some polishing,"This book has some good content but needs some polishing. This book is the assigned text for 1 of my Master's classes. In each chapter, you can probably read the 1st paragraph and then skip the next 2 - 3 pages. The book makes too many repetitive statements. The same point will be made over and over again in only slightly different wording. Needs a good editor to hack away at it and then the book could probably be reduced by at least 1/4."
4,Generally worth having,"Not having a full (i.e. reasonable) manual supplied with Corel Draw 7 Select Edition, I was looking for a more in-depth book and this seems a reasonable choice. The book is in black & white, the centre colour pages are merely coffee-table book shots of award-winning works and somewhat irrelevant. However I found most of the book quite useful but I have mixed feelings about some of the examples produced by the author, some of which are very crude. However it does cover all major functions but the proper use of colour would have enhanced the book. Generally worth getting, and better than anything provided with my software."
5,A great account of a great movement.,"This a great tribute to perhaps the most influential design institute of the 20th Century.The story of it's development, philosophy, success and untimely end is perfectly chronicled here.The expert, novice and vaguely interested would find this book useful. It's a superb acaedemic source and an important catalogue. Bauhaus still influences design today and should also be regarded historicaly as yet another victim of the Nazi regime."
4,A solid overview of Bauhaus art and design,"Like the other titles in the World of Art series, this book is generously illustrated and provides a solid overview of a particular style. The author describes the historical context of the Bauhaus school, the development of the Bauhaus style, key figures at the school and within the movement, and the influence of Bauhaus art and design on future artistic styles. Most of the illustrations are black-and-white period photographs; the remainder (approximately 20%) are in color.This is a well-constructed paperback with a strong binding. It is a good introduction to Bauhaus, and also a good source for undergraduate students researching the style. For libraries with strong art and design collections, this volume complements others that focus on individual artists and designers."
4,Damn fine background.,"Great background to an institution which was about as rock'n'roll as they come. The soul put into the establishment, its teachings, its beliefs (collective and individual) and the commitment of those involved is staggering - its a shame that it really doesn't have an equivalent today, but that's todays politic and media for you. Consice account that was almost written as a historical novel - Christ, I even read the bibliography at the end !! Off to find more books about it all now. Oh, and listen to Blumfeld, International Jetset & Earl Brutus whilst reading this too.AJC 1999"
3,not the correct listing,The songs here are not from the album pictured nor by Marcia Griffiths. By a more contemporary singer named Marcia.
3,"Beautiful to Look At, but Extremely Slow","Shot in Cinemascope in DeLuxe color, David Selznick's version of the Hemingway classic is beautiful to look at in its use of Italian and Swiss locations - even though the First World War atmosphere seems a little unconvincing at times. At 140 minutes, the film is way too long; its narrative becomes extremely slow, especially during the romantic scenes involving Rock Hudson and Jennifer Jones. As the British nurse Catherine Barkley, Jones seems a little too old for the role; but she acts extremely well, especially in the death-scene, when the light shines on her pallid face as she slowly passes away. Rock Hudson provides an admirable foil, proving that he was a capable performer as well as a striking screen presence. Vittorio de Sica contributes a notable cameo as a doctor driven to distraction by the rigors of war."
2,Don't bother to say hello,"A dreary adapatation of Hewingway's novel ""A Farewell to Arms"" by Selznick, starring Rock Hudson and Jennifer Jones. It is a disaster that ended Selznick's career. Jennifer Jones at 38 is simply too old to play the heroine, who is supposed to be 23 or something. Hudson and Jones lack chemistry, and Hewingway's essence is nowhere to be found, this is a movie that was simply doomed. The Gary Cooper version is probably better. Selznick's decision to cast Jones was a fatal mistake. Don't bother to say hello to this movie, it might drain the spirit out of you, don't let the DVD cover of Hudson and Jones kissing fool you. This is a romance without any romantic elements, don't even compare this to ""Gone with the wind"", which is Selznick's calling card."
4,Fun films for kids,"This pack has the Land Before Time films #s 5-8. My preschooler especially enjoys #5: The Mysterious Island, and #8: The Big Freeze. The only film I thought was particulary lame is #7: Stone of Cold Fire. That one has a particularly poor storyline, the music is a bit too melodramatic, and the supporting acting is just a bit too over the top in my opinion. The other 3 films are pretty good and there are even some scenes that can still make me laugh after already seeing them probably 100 times at this point. I don't think I've met a kid yet that wasn't entertained by the majority of the Land Before Time films."
1,The Land Before Time,"The title sounded impressive, as I have been studying the connection between Old Testament and New Testiment. When it arrived I was shocked to realize that it is apparently an animated version of children stories."
5,Yanni in Words,His book is a rewarding experience which will make one laugh and cry. It will make your heart warm and at the same time provide you with a clue on how to live through life's lessons. He opens up and gives the reader the chance to learn about the real Yanni. It is a trip that all should take. It will reward your soul.
5,Yanni in Words,Yanni is one of my favorite artists. His book was captivating from beginning to end. It gave me a great insight and understanding of Yanni on a personal and professional level. It was written in the first person which made it an even more intimate reading experience. I hope he writes another book sometime soon ...
1,Very disappointed,"When I first bought the book, I was very excited to start reading it. But, when I did, I couldn't believe what I was reading. Some of the stuff was a bit too graphic especially about the bordello incident. Too much information!I'm not saying that everyone should be perfect either but come on! I guess that type of life comes with the territory especially when you're in the music business. I really felt sorry for Linda Evans because she deserved a man that could really be ""there"" for her and not be so full of himself. There are alot of ""takers"" out there in this world and very few ""givers"".Overall, I wish now that I hadn't bought or read the book because I would have rather kept my good opinion of Yanni."
4,Interesting,"If you're a Yanni fan, you will like this book.It's self serving at times, but for the most part, it offers intriguing insight into the life of this performer.Oh, and Yanni definitely wants you to know that he used to get laid a lot."
5,So candid so Yanni !,"I really liked this book! I can't believe how openly he has spoken about himself. I have listened to his music and felt his passion, but now I can feel where it is coming from. The book let's you know a person this truely magnificient doesn't just get there they earn there way to the top and become a little more wiser along the way. He is a true example of hard work paying off. I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to know about his soul, passion and feelings. PS. I really liked the photos also."
5,I LOVE YANNI!,"This books rocks! With Greek mania occuring at every corner (think Olympics, think Greek Weddings, think George Michael, think YANNI!), there could not be a better time for Yanni to have his memoir published. I loved the descriptive accounts of Yanni's boyhood in Greece and how his career despite seeming complacent and together took as many spills and tumbles as someone you'd expect to be spotlighted on Behind the Music. And the photos! I'd never thought these words would ever come out of my mouth but YANNI WAS A HOT BABE!!! Check it out, you'll probably surprise yourself with how much of a fan you'll become by the end."
3,"Bob's your uncle, and Yanni's your aunt","This book is unlike anything I have ever experienced. It's, like, whoooah. It kinda made me ... well ... y'know. All over. Inside, too. Yanni manages to transcend the ephemera of life amazingly, making it all transparent to searchers. Even the most sceptical of readers will not fail to benefit from his eclectic witch's brew of spirituality and folk wisdom. The only reason it gets three stars rather than five is because I got it accidentally, whilst trying to buy a(nother excellent) book about Yannick Noah."
1,This book has no soul,"A thoroughly bland book, written in a matter-of-fact, flat narrative -- sorely lacking depth and dimension. There is no sign of introspection or personal reflection, only Yanni's inflated ego. The book is a simple-minded retelling of his life. Yanni's self importance and arrogance lurk throughout. While he purports to ""tell it like it is,"" it is apparent he is most concerned with portraying himself in a certain light. Even when he talks about things like his rock 'n roll days, he makes sure he doesn't come off looking too bad, i.e. ""every one was doing it then"" and ""I was always upfront with the girls before getting intimate with them."" (Hmmmm). It seems his ego is such that he can't really reflect upon his own weaknesses and mistakes - he can only make excuses. His memory and accounts of some of the facts in the book are equally biased and inaccurate. One can only hope that he isn't as monochromatic and one-dimensional in his own mind as he comes off in this book."
4,Best book of it's kind!!,The Vedauwoo area is unique in it's diversity of climbs and the climbers that frequent this area. This Guide Book has captured both aspects: the wild and mystical Spirit of Vedauwoo and the Hard Core attitude of the climbers. It covers the range of climbs from the Raw Gut Beginners to the Hard Skinned Off-Width Crack climbers that Shred their way up impossible looking ascents. The photos and route lay-outs are simply the best of any guide book in the Rocky Mtn. region and route descriptions give you JUST enough information without taking all the Adventure out of the climb!! A MUST HAVE !! for any climber in the area.
2,Needs Work!!!,"...I have found that this guide documents alot of the climbing at Vedauwoo very well, but misses the mark entirely in some cases. After getting to know the long time local climbers it is really sad to find out that Skip Harper has taken lots of liberties with renaming routes, or assigning grades to routes that he abviously has not done. I give his book a two star rating just because of the lack of investigation in some cases and the complete disregarding of history that he puts forth in his book."
4,A good read,"An interesting, fast read for a university film course. However, I can say it's a bit of a letdown learning how cheaply and efficiently these amazing independent films were made."
5,My favorite,"It's my favorite tea and no grocery stores have it near me. I have to order tea on-line, which seems crazy."
4,"Grim, but Great",Only Vonnegut could make such a tragic story humorous. It probably will rank as one of his most memorable books in my mind. Vonnegut once again weaves his story between flashbacks and flashforwards and keeps the pages turning. I read this book on a flight to Chicago and almost passed on the peanuts so I would not be interrupted. Definitely one of his best.
4,"A fast paced, funny return to form","After several letdown novels and ""autobiographical collages"" in the late seventies, ""Deadeye Dick"" was a blast of fresh air. A dark comedy involving one Rudy Waltz who accidentally shoots a pregnant woman, killing her and her child, when he points his gun out his window and fires for the sake of it. The book deals with one wild thing after another, and pokes fun at the darker side of nuclear bombs, Hitler's art, gourmet cooking, and public atrocity exhibitions of prisoners. A wild romp and one of the few later books that is a must for Vonnegut fans"
3,eh...,"It was ok. it was written in the usual eccentric vonnegut style, but i couldn't really get into it like I did with Bluebeard. Maybe i'm not reading into it deeply enough, i'm sure that's part of the case, but whatever. I found the whole tumor imagery especially disturbing, but i have to say that Rudy's playlets were hilarious."
4,"Oh, so THIS is what Vonnegut's about...","Even though I was a fan of Vonnegut before I picked up this book, I never quite understood what the whole ""funny/sad"" part of his books was. I enjoyed Vonnegut because he was thought-provoking and had crazy, page-turning ideas.Deadeye Dick, though, really captured that humor mixed with sadness. I find that Rudy Waltz is one of the most sympathetic characters in literature, and his struggles to overcome the stigma of being Deadeye Dick are genuinely moving. This is a good introduction to Vonnegut's work"
2,Vonnegut's worst,"Of all the books in Vonnegut's body of work, this provides the bottom of the barrel. If one is to grant that each book is a mirror of where he was at in his life, it's safe to say this was a bottoming point before he was able to reflect upon it with a smirk. The miserable moments provide neither glimmers of hope nor wistful pronouncements of ironic futility. For fans, it's a must read because hr wrote it, but don't expect what you felt with ""Bluebeard,"" ""Breakfast of Champions,"" or ""Mother Night."""
4,"Slight wacky but hey, we're talking Vonnegut","Deadeye Dick is the kind of thing that your average person might write after a prolonged lack of sleep when the 'giddies' sets in. It doesn't entirely make sense, and some of the themes are a little wacky, but it is still very entertaining and fun to read. Vonnegut manages to use plenty of his traditionally biting humor throughout the book and deals with neutron bombs, eccentric artists, criminal coverups, and life after Ohio is obliterated. I am already biased because I am a big fan of Vonnegut's style of writing, but I found the book to be consistently interesting and can't wait to get another of his books"
2,Depressing,"This is not among Vonnegut's best. The plot rambles, the jokes aren't very funny, and above all it's pretty depressing, and lacks meaning. I would recommend Vonnegut's Cat's Cradle or Slaughterhouse Five, but this one is best left unread."
1,Only Galapagos was worse,"With so many books under his belt, Vonnegut was bound to write a dud. The characters and storyline were boring. A neutron bomb destroys a city, too bad it didn't destroy this book."
4,"Dead, But Not Quiet Yet","Vonnegut's mordant humour, born from dark despair is in full flight with this novel. His characters are haplessly and passively accepting of the card tricks Fate shuffles; cards turned with lusty zappiness. As he deepened his craft, Vonnegut's books eased into conversational pace. The quality is detectable from the early awkwardness of,'Mother Night' to this smooth,'Dead Eye'. At the height of his powers he gave us,'Cat's Cradle'(my introduction to his writing & still my favourite), 'Slaughterhouse Five,'(made into a passable movie) and later,'Bluebeard'. All of Vonnegut is worthy stuff."
5,Vonnegut is a True Master,"Deadeye Dick grabbed me by the scruff and brought me into a world that i belived was real. Few authors are capable of such mastery. This novel has a powerful theme which is unique in many ways, and could not be realized in the same manner by anyone but Vonnegut himself. Don't just read this book, savor it like a literary delicasy."
3,my top 5 wrestlers of all time,"didn't read the book, just wanted to offer my opinion of who the greatest 5 wrestlers of all time are.1. Ric Flair2. Bret Hart and Shawn Michaels (tie)4. Hulk Hogan5. Andre The GiantThanks."
2,The Kidnap!,"The Kidnap!When Johnny Jackson unaccountably disappears, his grandfather contacts the police for help. As they prove to be uninterested, he turns instead to Colonel Parnell of the Parnell Detective Agency. It seems at first to be a simple case of a missing person but they soon find themselves in the middle of a complicated cobweb of deceit, intrigue and murder all leading to a fascinating and illuminating scene which arise from kidnap and extends into murder and the rest of various illicit crimes. Chase once again shows his worth in another senseless but meaningful manner."
5,A Delightful Tale,"Although this is a story for young readers, I found it to be very entertaining. Hesper and Tristan should not be friends. They come from different planes. Yet their friendship is so strong that they band together to save the parallel planes of existence from possible destruction. The author has created a delightful tale of fantasy and mystery. It is a well-written story with a mythological essence. The characters are brought to life by the excellent use of visual images. The reader is taken on an enjoyable escape to another place. There are many subtle messages that shine through. The messages of trust, loyalty, love, friendship and the need to have faith are necessary for our younger readers to hear. I would highly recommend this book for young readers between the ages of 10-16."
4,killer,these guys are bad ass. and im trying to roll my pennys to get the money to buy the rest of their albums
2,well below my expectation,"I regret purchasing this item. Honestly, the article is not well-written and the content is not worth the money. I would recommend this download to be at a much lower price."
1,Thinly entertaining,"Jimmy Stewart playing a harmonica? Maybe in l941 America had its mind on the war and movies, like this one, were very loosely put together. Paulette Goddard plays her usual kinda dingy part. It is interesting to see Horace Heidt's band again. A young Art Carney is spotted in this not-so-unusual plot of struggling musicians, love on the fly, rushing here and there to make the auditions and play dates. You wonder how hunger these actors were to play in this movie or was it made on furlough for the folks at home."
4,My thoughts,"This made my life so much easier! I don't know how I would have lived w/o this movie...I really don't think I could have. Before this movie came into my life, I was a MESS! It totally changed me- my viewpoint in life, my attitude, even the way I dressed. I WILL NEVER FORGET YOU, FESS!"
1,"Do NOT buy, unless your cat can untangle himself","I just bought this for my cat, who is about 7 months old, and it's a great toy...BUT, 3 times in the past 3 hours, he has got his paw caught on the excess thread around the ball. I can't leave him alone with this toy."
3,Ho-hum and scared,"Cats love this kind of toy, right? Not mine. My two old cats just love to watch me make a fool of myself trying to get them to play with it. The young one is scared of it. I'll hide it for a month and try again. I've never had such a ho-hum reaction to this kind of a toy from cats...I've purchased similar toys in the past with great success. Maybe you have to start with them when they are kittens."
5,Better in the darkness with surround...,"The serpent and the rainbow, maybe the best cult horror movie for me, except the end, when special effects saturate the story, but it is based in a true story, very good script, acting, direction, and feelings... if you want the best response on you, have to watch it in the darknes with home theather, you will feel the same as the caracters... breath, breath..."
5,Powers that surround us,"Great Movie about the forces of nature, and how the mis-use of them can become tragic in ones life. It's really a Movie you can see the powers that exist, at work."
4,Classic movie,Well a friend at work told me about this movie so first I got the book and then the movie later on. It talks about Haitian Voodoo but being that it is a movie from the 80's it seems a bit far fetched. To me is seems like more of a hollywood reenactment of someones version of the truth rather than the truth itself. Good movie over all.
5,The Zombification Process...,"SERPENT AND THE RAINBOW is one of Wes Craven's last ""serious"" horror films. After starting off w/ a bang (LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT, HILLS HAVE EYES, NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET), Craven took a more silly turn in the late 80s / early 90s (DEADLY FRIEND, SHOCKER, SCREAM). SERPENT is not only a great Craven movie, it's also an excellent voodoo-zombie movie! It fits right in w/ classics like WHITE ZOMBIE and I WALKED WITH A ZOMBIE. If you enjoy such films, then you can't go wrong here!..."
3,read the book,"The movie's all right in and of itself -- but I wish they had stuck closer to the book, a great treatise on Hatitian culture. Wes Craven's depiction of the story is dark, fearsome, and destructive, while Wade Davis (whose name is changed in the movie) described a bright, vibrant, wholesome culture. Craven can't even keep straight who has the power of vodoun: in the book, the government fears and despises the making of zombis because they can't understand it, while in the movie its the government who controls the power and uses it as a form of political terror. Poetic lisence is fine, but please make sure your lies are straight."
4,Awsome Stuff For Horror Fans,"Only decent film about voodoo around. It gets a little silly towards the end, but for the most part, it gives the subject matter the respect it deserves. Highly stylistic, good acting by everyone. One of the best horrors to come out of the 80's."
2,B-movie that could of,"Thinking that since Wes Craven directed this movie that it would at least be semi-good since he directed such b-movies like ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" or spoof movies like ""scream"". Boy was I wrong. The idea was definately there. However, for a lack of budget and and lack of any type of supporting cast the movie just did not live up to its B-movie status. It is only for those who are horror fan deticated and/or Wes Craven fantaticts only."
1,Don't bother,"Very bad. I stopped watching it about half way through. The story is not very believable. Maybe I just wasn't in the mood for it. There seemed to be a lot of yelling, very drawn out yelling. The story is very slow and it lost my interest."
2,The Serpent And The Ra9inbow,The Movie was great but the captions took away from the movie.Had I kn0own that the film was captioned I would not have bought the film.
4,Renoir's Life,"This book was very informative, of both Renoir's life as well as his art. I enjoyed reading it thoroughly and would recommend it to any art lovers."
5,Easy way to add privacy,"I needed film to use in an apartment that could be removed and also provide some way to block the heat of afternoon Texas heat. The film was easy to apply, stayed on window well...just make sure you get out air bubbles and squegee all the way to the edges. It did reduce the sun/heat. Of course, you really cannot see outside...but if you don't mind losing the view this is ok. I would have liked to have the film a bit wider meaning wish they offered in other sizes, but I was able to make this work by buying several of themI would get films from this company again."
1,totally see thru,Totally see thru doesn't add the slightest bit of privacy it is a light blue tint to the window TOTALLY SEE THRU........ ADDS ZERO PRIVACY>>>>> ZIP
3,Works as advertised,The direction is easy to follow. It is not the easiest cutting them into desired size. So far they are staying put and fulfill the purpose.
4,Must read and pictorial feast on Houston's heritage,"Del Pueblo is a must-read and pictorial feast for anyone interested in Houston's history--Hispanic or not. Dr. Kreneck's love of, and intimacy with, Houston's Hispanic community is evident throughout. The illustrations are excellently reproduced and the text clear and lively. This is not an in-depth treatise on everything Hispanic in southeast Texas, but rather a pictorial history of the impact Hispanics have had since the first Spanish explorers arrived in the 16th Century to the waves of immigrants that materially changed the face and texture of Houston at the end of the 20th. The book is enriched by the extensive use of primary records and photographs, many of which Dr. Kreneck was involved in adding to the holdings of the Houston Metropolitan Research Center as an archivist there."
3,a little cheesy,and a little corny. its really smooth synth pop i guess. not exactly what i expected from all the hype and reviews i read. ehh
4,Sugary Sweet,"Inspiringly fresh album in an all-too monotonous electronic music scene. The beats are tight, the vocals are dreamy, and the effects are original and lush, and, hey, that's all we ever really needed, right?"
2,Lack of Sonority,"After listening to ""So This Is Goodbye"" and ""Begone Dull Care"", I realized that this debut feels like a preparation for them. Don't get me wrong, I really like their work; the problem is the difference of quality between this debut and the other albums: It's slow paced, experimental and sometimes cheesy, plus the Rhythms are often broken and irregular, which can be good for someone who fancies different sonorities (or the lack of them!). My advice is: listen to the other albums, they are excellent. This one has it's moments, but not enough to be memorable."
3,Collins' most ambitious work,"Undoubtedly influenced by the success of Judith Krantz, Jackie Collins turned her hand to the family saga with ""Chances,"" which, unlike her previous novels, actually attempted to go a little deeper than strung-together intervals of sex in exotic places and inventive use of profanity. The result is a really good Jackie Collins novel, which translates into ""slightly better than mediocre."" Collins has never been much for character development, but compared to some of her other novels ""Chances"" is ""War and Peace."" A great beach read still, as is its sequel, ""Lucky,"" despite the dated outlook."
4,It's been a while,"I had an opportunity to meet and speak to J. Collins, at a book signing. she was fun and I enjoyed it much.Chances was a excellent book in a group of other stories about ms. Lucky. the book was great and it keeps you going."
5,a fab-tastic read,I read Chances over 25yrs ago & it still is as good as it was to re-read. it's a book you just don't want to put down. A real page turner :-)Chances
5,Entertaining Read,"I really enjoyed reading Chances. It was my first book by Jackie Collins and I read it pretty quickly even though it is quite long. There were multiple story lines and the story started off in 1977, then backed up to the 1920s. This got my interest because I kept wondering what things had happened in the characters lives to get them to where they were in 1977. I have thought about the book since reading it and also plan on reading the other Lucky Santangelo books. I liked the dialogue between the characters also. This book was great. My only warning is that it is at least ""R"" rated... so don't read it if you are offended by swearing, drugs or explicit sex scenes."
5,"Fun, original read!","I just love this story, it's about impossible to put down. It follows the crazy lives of several characters with love, betrayal, operations of the mob, murder-you name it- the only complaint is that it does include MANY graphic sex scenes, almost to the point of over-kill. This is definitely an adult read. I do plan to read the sequels too!"
5,"The best book, even guys love to read it.","This book will keep you at the edge of your seat and, trust me you will not be able to put it down once you start. From begining to end simply the best. The story just keeps you wanting more."
3,Chances,I really love this book but was very disappointed when there were spelling mistakes in this book and it being on a kindle i am not even sure which pages it was on as pages are not numbered
5,love it,Guys like Collins too. I'm proof. This is such a great book. When I watched the mini series when I was in military several of the guys actually asked to finish it. And the book is so excellent. I've read almost all of her books. I'll read them all when I get a hold of them. I especially love the ones about the Santangelos. Can hardly wait for the next one.
3,Ok but too long,Typical Collins book. Great characters doing exciting things but way too long. There were lulls in the almost 800 pages to be sure. But if you like her writi g and her characters you'll enjoy it
1,"So far, not what I expected","I'm only on page 60, so I can't speak to the book as a whole. But so far, there's been multiple rapes and meaningless ""quickies."" It's definitely not my idea of a ""steamy romance"" so far. I may not be able to read further."
2,defective?,"Probably I got a defective one, but was very hard tu lock/unlock, key wouldn't turn, was frustrating, I purchased it based on other people's review"
1,Defective,"Did not work upon receipt. Not a quality product when compared to ""The Club"" or Masterlock. I have all 3 types."
4,Very Good Tool,"Very helpful, I feel safe about my car when I use it. It gives me a peace of mind especially when the car doesn't belong to me."
5,great product for a great price,"When I did a search for steering wheel locks, this one was one of the most affordable ones, so I thought it might be a risk to go with one of the lower priced ones as opposed to the more expensive ones. But I went with it anyways, actually I got 2, and they were perfect! There was no need to spend any more. They work well, they do everything you need them to do, and as always, amazon service was perfect. No complaints and I'd definitely recommend this to others who are looking for an affordable and reliable steering wheel lock."
4,protecting my old Bimmer,Bought this to keep my vintage Bimmer save. Drivers door lock no working so the car is never really locked. bought this to have something quick and simple but secure. works great!
5,Ease of Use,"Very easy to use, it doesn't require a key to install it on the steering wheel (like my other one did) This makes it quick and easy to install, which makes it more likely to be used consistently."
4,"It is what has been said in the list, YET...","Before buying it, make sure that it is long or short enough to fit into your car. I spend 30m to rotate the wheel in order to find a way to fit it to my wheel, and that caused the most troubles to the potential theft"
2,Not the best,"Kenton had a few good albums in the 1970s and this isn't one of them. In fact, this is perhaps the weakest due to the material and the performances. The band is extremely sloppy (especially the trumpet section), the saxes are under-recorded, and everyone, including Kenton, sounds like they can't wait for it all to be over. You might feel the same way after a listen.I have this CD because I'm a Kenton completist, but there are some worthwhile moments, like ""Body and Soul"" (that's completely out of place on this record), and Peter Erskine lays down a nice groove behind the trumpet solo on ""Blue Gene."" ""Being Green"" would've been a nice dramatic chart if not for the embarrassing, monotone group vocal...just try and concentrate on the flugelhorn solo in the background of the middle eight.Fans of rockish stage band charts will like this album, but put purists be warned."
2,Another post-prime Kenton let down,"I got this as a gift because I enjoy Stan's work. What a bummer. Any true Kenton fan knows that when Rugolo and Maynard left, Kenton never had original stuff anymore, and this album was an attempt to make another ill-advised come-back. If you like Kenton, get the Progressive Jazz albums cut before 1950."
4,A one-book manual on how to build a boat.,"This is a beautifully illustrated book, easy to read, and simple to understand. It is really all you need to build your own wooden book. It is inspirational and important at the same time. This would make a wonderful textbook for those whom wish to study the craft in a more rigorous academic environment. While it is a great book, I found some other books better as far as being more complete and up to date. I rated this book a four star rating for this, and only this, reason. I recommend it, and suggest that it would make a great addition to any library of book construction techniques."
5,You can use this book for ANY self-contained RV,"Good book, covers more than you want or need to know. One book does it all. If you want to build a boat, get this book first. I'm using this manual to rebuild my travel trailer (yes, my travel trailer) since books on travel trailers don't really deal with how to refurbish them, only just maintain them. This book has a lot to say about framing, electrical systems, plumbing, layouts, materials, and waterproofing. Travel trailers should be built like a boat since water damage has a lot do do with why travel trailers need renovation. I'm still reading and I'm still riveted. This is a very good book. I might change more than I first figured on after reading this manual. Lots of good info in this book."
4,The Mask of Command was great!,I read this book after reading The History of Warfare and The Price of Admiralty by the same author. I thought that this book was fascinating and its critique of the leadership styles of the four commanders was correct and interesting. If you like Keegan's other books you'll also like this one.
3,armchair analysis with lots and lots of words,"I didn't think much of this book. Keegan's character introductions at the beginning of each section are quite good. When reading about Wellington's adventure throughout the four days of the Waterloo campaign, I believed that Keegan had written a great book. Then I got to his analysis and comparison to Alexander. As I fought my way through these subsequent pages of boredom I kept asking myself the question, ""who cares?"" The whole premis of the book would be better discussed over a couple beers and then only by history nerds. I would not recommend this book to anyone in the military, specifically in combat roles, hoping to mine some leadership leasons. I would have given the book two stars except for Keegan's undeniable command of exciting history prose, which is unfortunately only evident in small doses throughout this book."
1,This book uses outdated concepts proven to be ineffective.,"This book will try and convince its readers that they have some sort of mythical disease of addiction. For years and millions of dollars the organization of NIDA has tried to prove that such a disease exists but has failed to do so. This book also goes on to claim a non-religious stance but yet suggests a contact with God be established. It is supposed to be a book that tells all how to end their addictions but yet never mentions how in one of its 'twelve steps.' I feel this book would do well in the fiction, faith healing, and how to be a cultist sections, but other than that, it is worthless. I only give it a two as opposed to a -2 because some of the stories in the back are quite humorous."
1,Hocus Pocus,"Just more of AA's nonsense only replacing alcohol with drug. Still asking the reader to become a we people and give up their identity to that of an addict--for life. No where in the book is it shown how to end an addiction other than a suggestion to turn our will over to any god ""we"" so choose and do a bunch of silly busy work. Same boring stories that try to sell the program using an emotional slant.Just another attempt to proselytize folks into a religious and spiritual program. ""The Real AA"" by Ken Ragge and ""The Diseasing of America"" by Stanton Peele are must reads before selecting a recovery book, especially this one."
4,a useful book,"The NA book is quite a useful book for those who need it. It comes from the AA text and a need for a text specifically for drugs. I found it isn't quite as dry reading, and for those who have a drug problem, more pertinant than the AA book alone, though you should supplement the NA text with the AA text. If you or someone you know has a problem with drugs, this book is an absolute must to have."
3,Not what I was looking for...,"I wanted this trivia to play with the family or with a few friends. I like NTN Buzztime, but read the many negative reviews of the home system. I opted for this and the Holiday Trivia DVD, and I'm not pleased. It is low quality and simple. Some of the questions are way too easy (great for the little ones) and not very challenging for adults. There is no way to select answers, it just slowly removes the incorrect ones. Moves too slow for family and friend gatherings - only good for a party where there is alot going on. Wouldn't recommend unless you are looking for low budget entertainment at a party."
4,Heart and Lungs,"I don't think it's as good as Fast Stories... or Feeling You Up, but it has it's moments... ""Heart and Lungs"" and ""Married in the Playground"" are the good songs here."
4,Great Movies,"I realy loved these movies when I was younger. The first 5 are the best, I particulary enjoyed #4 and #5. But I think on th last few they have begun to lose their touch. I think the newest ones, like a ""The Journey To Big Water"", which features a song about imaginary friends, are more marketed for younger preschool children. This may be because I am older. I still love these movies that I grew up with."
4,Great videos for all ages,"The land before time series is great collection of movies that do a good job teaching important principles to all viewers. I found it interesting to watch how the little gang of dinosaurs ""evolved"" throughout the series. I also found it interesting to see how the animation itself evolved through the movies. I, like a few others, did find the addition of songs to the series from the second movie on to be a bit of a detriment to the series...however some of the song are good and can be catchy."
4,What a deal!,"As purchaser of DVDs for a public library, I want to select a wide variety of titles and to use my budget wisely. The library already had Land Before Time X, XI, and XII on DVD, and a few of the earlier ones on VHS. This 9-movie box set brings us almost up to date (XIII is now out) and cost much less than buying the individual titles! These are very popular movies, always being circulated! Go to your library and check them out!"
1,dont bother,Don't bother buying the whole volume set. Save money and only buy the first one. I agree totally with the other person who said this. The many other sequals are not as good as the first one. The first will always be my favorite and I love to watch it every couple of years to relive my childhood. Stick with the classic.
1,Teaches children bad behavior,"My almost-three-year-old had been watching these movies for weeksand I didn't figure out until recently that they have been teaching him bad behavior. First of all, one of the little dinosaurs screams constantly throughout these videos and this teaches little kids to scream just to make noise. The movies are also filled with smart-alec, bratty language that kids watching it will pick up on, like: ""See you, wouldn't want to be you"", and screaming, ""Its not fair!"" while stomping their feet. One of the movies has a scene where the kid dinosaurs are going to ""Show the grown ups that we aren't babies anymore"" by disobeying their parents and venturing into a dangerous swamp that they were told to stay out of.There are so many good children's movies out there that teach good values and behavior. This is not one of them, however, andas a parent I recommend not bringing it home."
5,Great Instrument,This is a fun and beautiful instrument. It was shipped very quickly and sounds great! I would suggest this for anyone who enjoys music.
5,"Best movie you, never heard of","I saw this movie almost 2 yrs ago at a sneak preview and was amazed how well written and acted it was. Chris Cooper should have rec'd his Oscar for his proformance in this movie. HE WAS GREAT. I don't understand why it was never released to the general public, but happy to pay the $23.00 to treat my family and friends to the movie I've raved about for 2 yrs."
5,Crazy Road Trip,"This movie was such a great surprise. I had never heard of it and, once I watched it, I had to see it again, and again. The storyline is as crazy as the Interstate...Zany comedy, ridiculous drama, and surprise cameos by a lot of A-listers. I can't even mention any of the scenes because each one was a story in itself. Take a trip on Interstate 60, and you'll see what I mean. It's a great ride!"
1,BAD BAD BAD,"This movie is story about a man making a wish in 22 birthday (the man looks like a 30 years old person), he's looking for answers in his life because it's time for him to become an adult. All he gets is a trip in an unexisting road with mysterious people, some of them are good actors like Patrick Swayze or Ann Margret (what is she doing here?). In fact, the movie explains how a boy becomes and adult and a risponsible person with an inmature script. You better forget this story."
2,Great story if only the language was cleaner.,"YIKES.. Saw this on TV a while back and there was no cussing. Bought the DVD and wow, it was filled with it....way too much. But the story was very creative and would be a great family film if the language was cleaner. Clean language would've earned a 5 star rating."
5,Film that makes You wonder every time You watch it,"Excellent film; it has a degree of reality, meta-reality and fantasy in it. It has a conclusion(s); you decide what these are. This is not a typical Holly Sci-Fi with a typical action/adventure common factor. It makes one wonder and ponder about everything one perceives every day. It reminds people how important small decisions may be. It ridicules what we ""learned"" to accept as something ""normal."" Again, this is an excellent film."
1,boring,It has the feel of one of those 50's instructional videos. It's very predictable and horribly cheesy. It has a few good ideas in the story but those ideas are badly portrayed and the actors say their lines like they are just lines. They swear a lot but not out of strong emotion maybe just to give the movie a rough feel which it fails at doing. I hated it. It was horrible. If you're thinking it's worth a shot it isn't.
4,wow!,"this movie tripped me out! It totally messes with your perception. Funny thing is, I am going to be a lawyer.... lol"
2,A cute movie -- nothing more.,"A formulaic fantasy movie that's been done before, but mildly amusing nonetheless. not the kind of movie that you'd like to see more than once, however, because you've seen the formula before in other movies. If you've never seen this movie before, it can provide a mindless distraction for about 90 minutes, but don't expect anything original or profound.The reviewers who give this movie the type of rating that should be reserved for ""Citizen Kane"" really need to get a clue, or perhaps they just need to outgrow their teenage years."
1,Interetate 60--Never shipped,I placed the order and then several weeks later I got an email saying the order had been canceled.
2,Probably Not the Worst Film Ever Made,"Bow wow. The protagonist's 'gosh gee whillikers' presentation might be appropriate for a 12 year old; here it just seems bizarre. Gary Oldham, whose acting I usually like, is horribly miscast in a leprechaun role. Imagine Walt Disney meets John Carpenter with a hefty dose of Dukes of Hazzard thrown in. I can't imagine where the positive reviews are coming from if not from shills."
4,A Norman Rockwell/ Horatio Alger Production,"This is what years ago would have been a great ""B"" movie that overshadowed the feature. It's the opposite of it's a wonderful life. What it says is that you do what you want to do and screw everything else. But, you must do what you want, no lies, do what you say. That's right no adjustments and no give-ins for money or love or anything else. If you aren't true to yourself completely, you've got no one to blame but yourself.Zeb Kantrowitz"
4,"Insightful, and entertaining...","I caught this movie by chance on Cable, missed the first 45 min. I was really curious as to how it started because the part I did watch was very entertaining. I couldn't resist buying this movie on Amazon. Good character casting and I think James Marsden and Gary Oldman were superb. Good story that keeps you entertained!"
5,"A Road Less Traveled, Is Worth The Trip","A great fantasy, combined with a romantic adventure. This is a sleeper that will keep your interest. Interesting characters, well played by a fine cast. Highly recommended."
3,Not as good as the reviews,"I didn't find this movie to be nearly as good as the stars would suggest. Too predictable, too illogical and just seeming to lack a depth.It was ""ok"", but I think 3 stars is generous."
3,OOOOOPS,"Honestly, I couldn't put this book down. However, the editor should be admonished for the MANY distractions! Does anyone read manuscripts besides MAC?"
1,"Shame reaches new level, and I reach my limit.","The story of September 11...as told by Cantor Fitzgerald, by Howard, by Barbash (the ghost writer who won the byline after Lutnick dropped his).This thing is too far removed. Interesting angle but what I want to hear is Lutnick's own honest words, not some ghost writer take thirty minutes of audio and then stamping out a novel for quick publication. Alright, in all fairness this guy Barbash was old buddies with Lutnick and claims to have ""shadowed"" him for awhile after the trajedy. But this book doesn't really amount to much, and I just didn't enjoy it in the least."
4,painful topic but wirth reading,"This book made me do even more thinking about fate, whether I wanted to or not. it was hard to put down even though I didnt want to read it.its compelling. I wanted to read someone elses story since my own is too familiar. I, like Lutnick, waited for word from a loved one(my husband) on that awful day, to say that he was alive and safe..my husband came home, Lutnicks brother and most of his entire company didnt. this book is worth reading even considering the fact that so many have been written in the past year and a half. its worth reading about that day and him and the impact of the aftermath of Sept 11 on Cantor Fitzgerald.This was difficult to read(topic speaking) but worth reading, however painful......"
5,Unforgettable Reality,"This is a truly moving documentary of events which affected all of us but especially Cantor Fitzgerald. This truly puts a human touch to the CEO and the rest of the survivors. This story is a lesson for all of us. It is a lesson of life and survival, through pain and triumph. A beautiful monument for all the victims of that horrifying day..."
1,"comments on Santa Fe's hamburgers, burritos, enchiladas",I do not appreciate you making comments about our food in such a way. So many of the recipes that are such a raving success now are still made from old recipes from the old dirt roads of Santa Fe. The recipes that are new don't taste the same way our native food is made. People that don't know any better go for it because of all the hyp on it. Native Santa Feans and their decendants know the difference of today's foods and the originals. Please don't make such a comment that until these chefs came along that no one knew how to cook...we are the ones that taught the likes of them.
3,"looks great, hurts like hell","These shoes look fantastic, but they seem to be a different shape to my feet - they're too long and too narrow, giving me blisters on my pinkie toes."
3,diving,Some guys I work with on my Army dive team swear by these as dive booties because you can take your fins off and move out cross country without having to stop and put on boots. I bought a pair to try out and thought they were ok. I have kind of a wide foot and low arches so this shoe isn't really made for my foot.
5,The New Roman Sandal That Should Be Owned By Every God...,"Lord, could Converse have got it any more right? One thinks not. The Converse All Star Chuck Taylor canvas shoes are everything one could need from a shoe and more. They are stylish, available in colours that vary from orange to pink, the more comtemporary leather versions, low cut and high cut. These baby's contour the foot so well,it's almost like walking on air! The canvas hugs the ankles, providing support...but the most important features of the shoes are that they are unisex (they look great on guys and girls) and they can be dressed down with jeans, or elegantly dressed up with a pair of tailored pants. These shoes are definitely to die for."
1,Wrong product received,"I ordered the standard Black shoes, but instead received the Black Monochrome ones which weren't even listed as being available in my size."
4,a classic,Converse's are classic. they are the shoes people are always going to wear. i like the high tops better though
1,Wrong size AGAIN,"I ordered this item two weeks ago. I ordered a size 11 and got a 7.5. Went through the hassle of getting a refund, repackaging and shipping the item. Then I ordered a new pair after being assured that I would receive the right size. However ONCE AGAIN THE SHOES ARRIVED IN A SIZE 7.5. This is ridiculous. Please beware, don't waste your time."
1,not so good,"the shipping time was great, but they sent me low tops instead of high tops. they said if i send them back they'll send me the right ones but i shouldn't have to, they should've got it right the first time."
5,Larry Bird!,I was Larry Bird for halloween and what better way to complete the costume then with Green Chucks! They were fantastic!
5,Arrived on time,"I knew what I was buying, it was an OK price and it arrived, new, clean and on time. Been wearing them for 50 years."
3,not bad,i think that this sneaker was a bit tight but otherwise a good buy. waiting to procure a similar item.
5,"great, thanks!","ordered for christmas for teen daughter, couldn't find anywhere in stores, so thanks! Appreciated the fast shipping too!"
4,Cute a bit TOO big?!,The shoe itself is cute! Very bright colorful...and well pink. The only worry/complaint i have is that maybe its a bit too big? Maybe the reviews i read after i bought the item scared me making me wish that i would have gone down a size. So instead of an 8 maybe a 7.5 would have been nice? Well what can you do...you cant shrink em and they are cute. Im sure i can work it all out! The delivery estimate of the package was right on time. The seller was awesome! So all in all its pretty good :P
4,"Thanks for the service, is very good!","Thanks for the service, is very good!The product buy is of good quality, y arrived in the estimated time, I'm very happy with the service ... Thanks! and"" Happy New Year 2012""Sincerely;Angel Clark.Puerto Ordaz, Venezuela."
3,"Stylish, yet uncomfortable","Timeless look, whether you're a prep or a punk, anyone can pull off wearing a pair of chucks. Not good for athletic performance, it shocks me to realize they were created for basketball use. Ouch! Also, due to their lack of traction and feeble soles, it's easy to burn through a pair in a matter of months if they're your regular shoe. That makes them not worth the $40 price tag Converse is offering them for. If they were $20-25, maybe. I recommend this shoe for people more concerned with style than comfort."
2,"Love the Look, Hate the Feel","Grew up in Chucks and love the look -- the coolest one ever. Decided to try a pair again (am over 60 now) but found them painful -- like a slab of wood tied to my feet. What we need are geezer Chucks with cushioning! Converse, are you listening?"
5,Favorite shoes.,I've been wearing these shoes since I was 12 years old. They are in my opinion the most comfortable and stylish shoes ever made. Unlike other shoes that give way to much support. These shoes sometimes feel like you're actually not wearing shoes at all. A good way to feel the ground underneath your feet. Great for all occasions but not really recommended in the snow or heavy rain.
4,My first pair of Chucks..,"There are a lot of hard core Chuck Taylor addicts out there and after ordering my first pair I can say I'm still outside that bubble. They look good and the high top doesn't squeeze my ankle or anything like that. The sizing was dead on so don't order a half size larger thinking it's a good idea! My 9's were dead on. The Chucks are a seasonal shoe I wouldn't wear them in the extreme cold, or really rainy days. As for soles and support they're flat. I've owned Vans and they're even flatter than that with less support. It might just be I'm not a kid anymore, or I've got the wrong type of foot but I'm not so sure. I'm expecting these to be my pair of Chucks to last a while because I'm not gonna be wearing these every day. So, they're definitely good .. and everything that other people love, but I think I'd rather wear Vans."
4,Chuck Yeagers...Taylors,"These shoes are great. I value a lightweight, sturdy, hightop shoe for playing basketball(prison rules style) with the 11 other firefighters I work with. They require a tough foot, but if you can hack it they will save you some money."
4,nice casual shoe,"These shoes are worn very regularly by most of my family for nearly barefoot comfort. We like the colors and the look of them. I like the pink ones, because when I was a kid my mother told me I could be invisible in pink sneakers. I have 2 pairs of the high tops, one pair is 5 years old and while they are limp and a bit faded, the soles are still in decent condition. I also have a pair of the oxfords in raspberry rose which is just a fantastic pink color, and doesn't seem to be fading fast. My daughter loves her Skydiver Blue pair.They don't offer any support and they do run large. But as long as you aren't doing a lot of walking, they are very comfortable and light weight. I use my oxfords as slip ons with the laces tied a bit loose."
5,Awesome!,As always converse well never let you down with these silver boots! I love tham and use them all the time!
5,Converse tennis shoes,"I bought these for my eleven year old. She loves these, so, I don't really know how conforable they are because she really cares more about how they look. The price was the same as other vendors. It was just easy to order on-line."
2,They run too big!,"By the time we got the shoes and tried them on,went to return, and they didn't have them in the correct size he needed. So we are having to return them and my husband is left chuck-less. Perks: shoe looks great, awesome chuck-quality.Deffinatly go 1-1.5 size smaller then your norm though. I was kinda let down by how low their stock was. I tired to find something to replace this shoe in his size(13), but all I could find was the classic black & white. He wants a little variety from the norm."
5,My son's basketball shoes,"My son spotted the basketball shoes he wanted at the mall. I saw the price and I knew I could find them cheaper on line. I have purchased other things through amazon.com and have been very pleased with them in the past, so I thought I would try them first. We found the shoes he wanted for almost half the price. When I saw that I said ""SOLD!"" It was fast and easy, and they got really fast. We're happy."
1,"Fix the Sizing Chart, For Crying Out Loud","I know chucks have weird sizing, and so a women's 8 is a men's 6 and so forth, but the size chart given here is idiotic. There are literally about 50 different sizes listed in the item details, with M(D) and all sorts of other inscrutable nomenclature next to each size. Maybe this reseller should take a hint from the converse website which has SIZE/CONVERSE SIZE (women's 8/converse 6) so the customer can have a chance of ordering the right size."
