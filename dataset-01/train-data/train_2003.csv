4,Satisfied,"It's much smaller than I expected, which makes it less interesting for my baby...the animals are too small for him to really see well.The sounds are mostly great...except that the sound of the rabbit is a ""boing"" for hopping, which isn't really consistent with what sounds the animals ""make.""The other oddity is the ""owl"" which isn't an owl, but a ""barn owl."" Seems a little complicated.Anyway, still it's a fun and safe toy for us to play with together."
2,I miss the pull string...,"When my son pulls down the handle the noise it makes going back up drowns out the talking.The string was quite and you could her it clearly. This one, we have to listen really close to hear everything."
2,Rarely works,"I loved See and Say as a child, and I couldn't wait to get one for my toddler. I got this for him when he was 16 months old. If the toy actually worked consistently, it would be great. But half the time, we pull the lever and it just spins without saying anything. We have to pull it just right, kind of slowly, and have it on one of a few select animals, then it will work. When it does work, he loves it. I'm really disappointed."
4,oldie but goody,"We bought this for our 1 year old who's starting to make his own animal sounds. He's working on the coordination of pulling the handle to make the sounds, but luckily, he has a 3-year old sister that makes an excellent assistant. She has as much fun with this toy as he does.Definitely a nice toy - and it's not huge and hard to store when you're tired of looking at it."
4,Farmer says,"I bought this toy for my granddaughter that is 20 mo. old. It is the perfect size for her hands, easy to use and she can handle it quite well. She loves the 2 songs it plays. It is easy to carry around. Lots of different animals, more than just the usual. Glad I bought it."
2,Doesn't say the right animals,"This is a really cute toy and a good idea. But when you turn the ""page"" it doesn't recognize the new animals. It will say the animal that is in that spot when the page is turned the other way. For example the sheep is at the top left when the page is on the left. Then when you turn it and there's a cat in that spot it still says sheep. I would think this would get very confusing and frustrating for a child who is just learning their animals and sounds. Maybe I just got a defective one..."
5,Great toy to learn animal sounds!,"This is a great toy for your little one to start learning his/her animal sounds! My son got it for Christmas, and he loved pulling the lever down to hear the animal sounds. Pretty soon, he was able to tell us what certain animals say. The only problem I could find with this toy is that the lever is a little difficult to pull down. My son is almost two, and once we showed him how to do it, he was successful with it. Overall, he has a blast playing with it."
2,It broke so soon!,I bought this toy for my daughter and son. They are not rough players and have toys that work very well for quite some time...not this one. It was all over within the week. The animals and page do not match up at times. The toy jams and no sounds come from it until maybe the third try. My children have many leapfrog items..most are 2 years old..still perfect.This has been the only toy that actually broke.
5,CLASSICAL BOOK,"Es un libro de obligada lectura en materia de Derecho de sociedades de capital. Se puede decir que se ha convertido en pocos años en un ""clásico"" del Corporate Law."
3,Worth the money,"Great fragrance. It's organic. It's concentrated enough that you don't need to use a lot to get a great amount of lather. Unfortunately, it wasn't a perfect fit for my hair. The ""frizz"" in my hair is still a problem. Thank you."
2,Crappy Ni-Cad,"Don't buy this, I bought it and it died within 12-18 months just like the factory Ni-Cad. Buy the new Ni-MH replacement HHR-P402 it has now lasted me 2 years at least. I didn't have the Ni-MH option when I bought this so I guess I can't fault them for selling it but now the Ni-MH option is here so don't buy this."
2,Better than Radio Shack...but still sucks,"I started a comparison test between a Panasonic P-P511 and the Radio Shack equivalent last year. The Radio Shack guy claimed that theirs lasted much longer. It was a limited test of putting a new one in each of my two phones. Neither held charges for more than a couple days after the first 6 months. A little over a year later, the Radio Shack battery is completely dead now and the Panasonic battery lasts less than 30 minutes. Conclusion: Radio Shack's battery is no better than the Panasonic battery. I will try one of the alternatives suggested by other reviewers next."
2,Just okay.,"While the video includes some of Playboy's top playmates; Jennifer Allen, Jamie Bergman, Elsia Bridges, Deanna Brooks, Laura Cover, Lisa Dergan, Stacy Fuson, Vanessa Gleason, Alexandria Karlsen, Heather Kozar, and Stacy Sanches it leaves alot more to be desired. Each playmate got very little screen time since too much time was dedicated to touring Hef's Mansion. I would recommend Playboy's Girlfriends, the Playboy's Freshman Class, or Playboy's Girl Next Door over this one. Playmate Pajama Party is the worse Playboy video in my collection."
2,One good thing about it...,...is that it contains some VERY BRIEF footage from the 1970's which I liked; the remainder of the images are less than inspiring...the only person [male hetero that is] who would appreciate this video is a guy who was just rescued from a deserted island after a 10 years. There really should have been some g/g sequences to make it more interesting.
4,"If you like to watch girls get massages, swim, and play pool","This is one Playboy's better videos. It has various scenes of the Playmates going through the mansion. Some playmates get more onscreen time than others, such as Vanessa Gleason. My problem with this ""DVD"" is that it's not long enough. If Playboy made 2hr length DVDs, the viewing experience would be a lot better!"
5,great alternate,Bought this for my mom who saw it at a store for 5X the price. Very happy with your product and can highly recommend!
5,Indescribable,This is awesome! Everyone should watch it!I plan to share it with all my family and friends.I will be buying more of Louie Giglio's tapes!
5,Really Indescribable,"Great video to watch as a reminder of the God we serve. When times are tough and we need to remember how big our God is then this is a good encourager. I would recommend for any group to watch both new believer, non-believer and veteran believer. We all can use a reminder every now and then. Lou Giglio is a gifted speaker and easy to listen to as he presents his message."
4,truly indescribable,"Dear Amazon - This ""Indescribable"" DVD was truly a fantastic view of our ""out-there"" and ""beyond"" us that I'd never dreamed existed. I know from a friend who has the hubble on his computer that there are hundreds of views of worlds, stars, galaxies, etc out there. Oh! to have pics of them all. I look forward one day to be able to personally visit all over God's Universe and see more than we can see now; that hubble can only see a small portion. Thank you for allowing me to get in on what we are able to see now. DD"
5,Silence of the Hams,As usual an excellent book!!!!!!! I loved it and highly recommend it to everyone. Hard to 'put down'.
5,Excellent Solo Debut,"Lindemann's musicality, technique, and showmanship is evidenthere on a very high level. Of particular interest ishis very effective use of plunger to subtly modify his sound.The Gershwin preludes are especially entertaining. He usesthe extreme high high register a bit more frequently thanI would wish, but with high range this strong, it's easy tosee why he would want to use it.This is, overall, extremely musical playing. Minor quibblescan be made about intonation in some spots, but the listenerwill forgive these when the playing is so infectious andthe tone so fine. I found myself laughing on occasion becauseI was having so much fun listening to what the artist was doingwith these pieces. It is apparent that Lindemann and his fineaccompanists were having a great time with this music. Buy thisdisc and you will too."
5,Even better that I thought,"Need something to do? Grab this book and head towards the cemetery! Being more than just a final resting place, cemeteries offer so much more for the living than just a place to visit our dearly departed. There is so much history and symbolism in cemeteries and I can't think of a better tribute to those who lie beneath the stones than taking the time to understand who they were. Hanging out in a cemetery isn't creepy, it's a learning experience. This book is the perfect size and the photos and research really show the authors passion for this subject."
3,Info great... book is small & hard to read,Information is great but format leaves something to be desired. Book is odd size especially considering price and type is very small. Get out your magnifying glass for this one. Layout and type really take a lot away from the book.
4,I Would buy It Again,I liked the size and format of the book. It is sort of like a pocket size guide. I wish the pics could have been bigger tho. When I finish a book a I put it in a give away pile or add it to my collection. This one stays in my collection.
3,book review,My book arrived quickly and in perfect condition. I am very satisfied and would buy from this merchant again with no worries!
1,not that great,"This book was very disappointing - from the cover to the contents. The cover image you see on the info. is not really a cover, it is only an image on a small piece of paper wrapped around a potion of the actual blank cover. Then inside, the information is so general and shallow, that it is virtually useless. I wish I had saved my money for a book that actually had some academic significance."
2,"Entertaining as a cartoon, but kind of dumb","My kids and I absolutely love the Wayside School books for their highly entertaining stories and for the joyfully clever ways they play with language and storytelling. Unfortunately, very little of that comes through to the movie. Sure, the movie fits in LOTS of elements from the books, but many of them are introduced inexplicably and have little role in the story. What's missing is the zany logic that makes the books so charming. If you know the books, you may enjoy the references, but the movie itself ends up being pretty standard cartoon slapstick. My five-year-old still enjoys watching it, but I was disappointed that the special intelligence and heart of Wayside School has mostly been lost."
4,Arrived very fast,"Arrived fast, great, enjoyed, but I need to take off because the movie changed so much from book, and left too much out"
4,A Good Dragonlance Book...,"I really enjoyed the second book of the Dark Disciple series and it was good to see a more ""human"" Mina. I found myself also warming to several characters I could not quite connect with in the first book, mainly Rhys, Nightshade and even Chemosh! Weis spins her tale in a manner that leaves the reader craving for the conclusion although as several readers have stated, the ending was pretty obvious although you wonder, how can she wrap this twist up in a pretty package and deliver it to the reader? Only time will tell..."
5,This book left me mesmerized and gasping for more of the trilogy.,I am not a light reader and i can easily say that this is the best book I have ever read. The only reason not to read/like the book is to not have read enough of the past Dragonlance books to follow the plot.
4,Great fan of R. Majere,"A little surprising how everything ended, now we can explain a lot from the previous trilogy and some strage stuff in the first book, I wonder how this is going to end. I didnt like why Raist cant be and she can. I hope M W to explain a lot of things in the forums."
4,Better than the first,"Though still not up to what I expect from Weis, this work is stil enjoyable. I like a bit more action. The character developement is expertly done and many of the side characters I actuallay came to care about.If you like her works, you will enjoy this one. Hope the third is better.If you like books like this one, might I suggest another I've recently come across. The Unsuspecting Mage by Brian S. Pratt. It's another fantasy adventure sure to please. I highly recommend it."
4,"Great read, but a few problems..","I would recomend reading this book. It's written well, and the story is very interesting and highly captivating.I just don't really like how the gods are portrayed. I don't agree with the gods being so impulsive, and quick to emotion. It really doesn't make much sense...."
4,Loved it,"I absolutely loved it. Couldn't put the book down. Never saw the ending coming, absolutely awesome."
3,Hilarity Ensues,"As someone who grew up with the original books, I can say that my first impulse with the trilogy is that it feels a bit like I've aged out of the writing. But, when I take off my I-R-SRS-ADULT hat and sit down to enjoy it, it's been a very fun series in spite of some faults.The strongest parts of the book are, in my mind, the parts with the gods' interactions. They are, for lack of a better word, hilarious. The dialog doesn't feel leaden at all and the attitude carries strongly. Indeed, I'd reread the sections with Zebiom again just on accounts of how funny and natural those passages felt.Some of the parts that were a bit tedious to read played into what I remember of Weis's weakness from other Dragonlance novels - good-aligned characters. Rhys didn't feel like he had quite as much of a presence compared to some of the other, darker characters.All in all, it's a decent enough book, but it's more enjoyable if you don't take it 100% seriously."
1,"Work just ok, but there are better options available","The idea of a color changing paint is pretty neat but I was pretty disappointed with this kit. I followed the directions to the letter, and put on about 6 coats of the color, and still got pretty poor performance with the color changing effect. Looking straight on the color appears blue but when you look at it at angle there is only a subtle change to a dark red. And this color change is only evident in bright lighting, completely unnoticeable in dimmer lighting. A better option I found was Rustoleum's ""Color Shift"" paint. Maybe they put more flakes in or just made it better but either way I was rather disappointed with the Duplicolor Mirage paint"
4,very good except for the flower,"Ever since I bought this toy for my son who is 2 yrs 3 months, he loves it. The only problem is the flower, when elmo sings give him a big hug - the flower is bulky and gets in the way. Apart from that it is very cool and my son love it, when he first saw the toy, his eyes lit up and he was oh so happy to get his favourite-elmo. A very good buy except for the flower."
1,Dr?,"Everyone knows that ""Doctor"" Pauc is a chiropractor, right? Not a neurologist. Just for the sake of clarity. I know how much people love titles so I want to be clear."
5,Very good,"Exciting as are most of the Star Wars books I have read. I have read all of the Jedi Apprentice and New Jedi Order books. My favorite characters are Qui Gon, Han, and Anakin Solo, but Tahiri is next in line. Nom Anor is my Favorite one to hate. Anxiously looking forward to the next book."
3,"Edge of Victory II: Rebirth (Star Wars: The New Jedi Order,",It's very good book. I recommed this book.
3,An average filler volume,"A number of different plotlines are going on in this book. Anakin and Tahiri face a threat from the peace brigade after their escape from Yavin 4. Han and Leia work on setting up an underground railroad to smuggle people out of Yuuzhan Vong held territory. Jaina Solo becomes involved in an effort to destroy Vong superweapon. Mara faces difficulties as her pregnancy nears its end and her illness returns.All of these plotlines run mostly in parallel without much intersection which doesn't give the book any focus as a novel. It's a decent enough read that seems to be mostly filler between more significant volumes in the New Jedi Order series. If you are reading the series, you will want to read this, if not, it's a poor choice as a standalone novel."
4,Best of the series,"After the series was just starting to elicit some yawns, Keyes had me back in the old Star Wars that I love. CLASSIC! I laughed out loud many times and there was true insight regarding the main character (A. Solo). I hate spoilers so I'm not going to go into the details. Unfortunately, I wish I could have personally directed the later novels. Star by Star killed it all! ! !"
3,Quite good! Read it fast...,"It still kept me with the fascination of the Yuuzang Vong! We finally learn that they are also only - human... Some of our people finally make ""friends"" with them.The only advice I have: Read this book in intervals of more than 2 hours! There are always three or so storylines going on in parallel, if you don't read long enough you'll loose track."
5,Good!,"Rebirth just hits the borderline between four and five stars. It's one of the best in the series so far. This one has a few surprising plot twists, and it also keeps the reader speculating about the rest of the series (Is the dark side near for Anakin?). Next is Star By Star, which hits the shelves in November. I can't wait!"
5,On the Right Track!,"EoV 1, Conquest was a great read, and EoV 2, Rebirth definantly didn't drop the ball. Excepting that the dialog seems a little forced at times, the action and story of this newest NJO novel are a great addition to the series. Everything is just pushing ahead on the right track. The Vong Juggernaut has finally ran into a major setback, but they are far from finished. The Jedi are starting to come together at last, with the possible exception of Kip Durron whose decisions seem to be getting worse and worse. The Solo kids are handling their problems a whole lot better. And, with great delight on my part, it looks like the active roles of Luke and Mara may again pick up and take hold!Once again, there were some little things that I didn't like. No mention of the Imperial Remnant, and galactic apathy still reins with the Star Wars citizens at-large. But, that takes nothing away from this terrific book. I wholeheartedly recommend it to all NJO readers! BUY IT!"
4,A Continueing Saga that leaves us hanging,"I won't spit out spoilers, but be prepared for plot twists like you've never known. Anakin, Mara, Jaina, Kyp, the Vong, Luke, the New Republic. All do something or experience something unexpected. We continue to learn more about the invaders, yet we also keep learning about characters whom we thought we knew. Read it, but only after reading the rest of the series."
4,The one we've been waiting for!,"This book contained a highly anticipated event, at least for me. I won't mention what it is for those of you who haven't read yet. Its a really great book that fills a reader with joy at the end, although the conflict with the v.v. has not ended. I think it could have been better if not perhaps a little longer, but an otherwise great read that makes u feel good! Buy it and Enjoy!"
2,It takes a strong stomach...,"I wish I could give this book a higher rating, because Keyes does well with what he's given. The problem is the overarching story: the New Jedi Order. So far, we've seen that those New Republic officials who aren't morons are spineless collaborators. The Jedi aren't much better: gone is the confident Luke from Episode VI, and in his place is an indecisive dillitante. Jacen, Jaina, and Anakin, the three Solo Jedi, aren't any better: they can't decide what action to take, whether they should use the Force or not, and their indifference leads to the deaths of millions. Towards the end of this book, I found myself thinking: I really don't care if these three live or die. And that's not the way I should feel about three important, central characters. I think Mr. Keyes does a good job with Han, Leia, and Lando, but their appearances are all too brief. I hope these books get better, but honestly, I doubt I'll be there to see it -- and that saddens me."
2,Can't picture John Wayne as this Hero,"I would recommend this only for the unintentional laughs it generates. the hero commits acts of assault, mayhem, robbery and arson, but they are actions taken against the bad guy, so that's ok, right?? and the fact that he burned down the town general store is not going to affect anyone at all. I would call the book dated, but there are other books of a similar vintage that give a much better story and a better view of the old west. honestly, the hero and his sidekick come across as written by an adolescent boy, and a rather cruel one at that."
4,Flight pattern differs,"I purchased this F-15 Backyard Flyer for my nephew's birthday, after purchasing a different model (Backyard Barnstormer) for his brother that was a huge hit! I wanted to get a different model so they could fly them together -- but tell them apart. This F-15 model did not fly as great a distance, and seemed to follow more of a circular pattern in comparison. It did, however, do a ""trick"" move at one point, and did a kind of rollover. The other model made a bigger impression due to the length of time in the air and the distance of the flights."
5,Outstanding,I can't believe I haven't seen this book on more chess 'lists' - Smyslov really stresses understanding - any player will make greater gains when armed with a strong endgame. My coach (a GM) first showed me this book in Russian - an outstanding tool for improving your game.
2,overpriced for such a simple collection of demo,"No need to buy this booklet which contains numerous games annotated (by that I mean with SIMPLE explanation that only leave you baffled). Save the money for everything else from gasoline to porn tapes, all the games that were provided within can also be found on chessgames.comThis book ended up being my bug beater..."
4,"Passionate, informed, articulate","Continuing where her earlier non-fiction books left off, Roy once again speaks around the world holding up a harsh light to leaders of economic and military might and power. One thing to note is Roy's wholistic view of resistance to injustice and progress by societies has evolved since her last writings. Many of her earlier speeches and essays stuck to a single issue- this book's speeches create links between economic power or powerlessness, racial or religious violence and the growing worldwide police state, and argues forcefully for a movement to stand up to these linked worldwide trends as a whole.The speeches have the eloquence Roy's fans have always looked to her for. They also name names and provide numbers for those like me who like more than generalities. An all around great book. Just wish it was longer."
4,This woman is the bomb.,There is nobody like Helen Baylor. Nobody can sing like her and nobody can beat her style. When I hear Helen I hear that old R&B sound mixed with Praise and Worship. This CD just demonstrates how God is using her.
3,"Ok, But There is Better Out There",It was worth listening to once. But I probably wouldn't purchase it again. Not too much improvement on his last album.
5,Great product.,"The Teeter Hang Ups F9000 Inversion Table is everything we thought it would be. It is very sturdy and well built, and it folds up really easily for storage. It was really easy to assemble. You can fully invert or set the tether at several different angles, so that you can hang without worrying about your movements flipping you over more than you want. I've only had it for a month or so but it really does seem to help with my shoulder and neck pain."
1,motion sickness,"Do not buy this item,if you have motion sickness. It gave me motion sickness a lot. I can't stand it anymore."
3,Raggedy Ann and Andy #1,One day Raggedy Ann and Andy and their doll friends decide to make a homemade fair. But when Andy gets a little out of hand and falls out the window Ann has to find a way to save her brother before mom sees Andy in her beautiful Rose bush. Will Ann make it in time to save her brother?
2,Missing parts,"The product it self seams to be OK but I have been waiting over 3 weeks for the parts to come that I did not recieve with the original package. If you are going to order this product or any product from techcraft, count all your parts before you start to assemble it or you will end up with a OK tv stand sitting in the corner waiting for your peices to come. What I don't understand is why it takes weeks to send small parts when Amazon was able to get the entire shipment to me in less then a week?"
1,Missing parts twice,"The first time i ordered this item, some parts were missing. I called the manufacturer to send me the missing parts, & their customer support was soo poor!! Amazon sent me a replacement within a week, but the replacement was missing parts too!!So i am returing both to amazon."
5,Great Sound!,"A friend from California recommended this cd to me when I told her I loved Sublime. I forgot about it, then found it on this site. I bought it and have never stopped listening to it. I hope these guys blow up soon so I can see them live in MA. I agree with most everyone that it is similar to Sublime, but has a unique sound. If you long for musical talent and intelligent lyrics(for a change), buy this CD. Fav song is ""Stormtrooper"""
3,weak,"great vibe. solid music. soured by lame lyrics. After converting to mp3's, I ended up deleting about half the album from my computer. The half that remains I actually like quite a bit and listen to fairly often."
3,It is good ... but nothing great,"But it is NOT 311 or sublime, or even Go Jimmy Go. Not even in the same class. The lyrics and music are far more simple, and in spots have an annoying country touch."
5,~sTone Love~,"Yeah this is one of the best 'skunk' (ska + punk) albums I've heard in a while. Next to Sublime they're nuttz, and for the fact that they come from Hawaii is even more nuttz. I first heard of Pepper from a friend. After I listened to sTone Love I went out and got their ""Kona Town"" aLbum and I've been pleased ever since! You should take a listen to 'GIVE IT UP' and 'STONE LOVE'. The good thing about Pepper is that no one out there has a sound as good as theirs right now.....~aLohas"
5,ONOLICIOUS!!,"THIS IS ONE CD YOU CAN LISTEN TO WITHOUT SKIPPING A TRACK!!IMMA LOVIN' EVERY SECOND OF THIS CD...PEPPER IS GONNA BE BLOWIN' THE AIRWAVES WITH ME IN GERMANY, AND EVERYWHERE I GO...CHEEWHOOO!"
4,Kick back and enjoy.,"I just went to Warped Tour 2003 near my home town in Pontiac, and early off Pepper was playing. We were only walking by the stage when thier melodic relaxing tunes drew me in, my friends followed. My first comment was ""Wow they sound a lot like sublime."" I stood there and enjoyed thier set, and it was definitely one of the highlights of the Warped Tour (besides Rancid of course). After that day I went out and bought this CD. This is awesome music to just kick back and relax to. Very good rythems and even better vocals."
2,"The Best thing about this cd is..,.","The first song, an a cappella piece that suggests these guys are homesick, Then the rest of the disc contains their downfall and that they weren't MTV calibre. Duh! They're not! THEY TRIED EVERYTHING TO GET THESE KIDS A HIT AND NOTHING WORKED! It's immaturity gone to hell.Except for the covers,there are no hits on this disc,but the music sounds better. The lyrics are stupid.I bought two of their discs because others said how great this was. Oh well. Live and learn.2stars for the music only."
2,lacking,"Being a devout Sublime fan, i was stoked to hear another band with a Dub-Reggae-Punk style. But after having the CD in a couple minutes i thought my CD player was on repeat. Pepper's repetitiveness topped with shallow lyrics doesn't do much in the way of drawing you in. Nothing too original, certainly nothing thought-provoking, and hardly inspirational. Honestly, i think I could do better.Stick with Sublime."
5,Must-own,"Alright, for anyone who has any remote interest in the sounds of Bradley Nowell and other forms of reggae-ska-dub-rock, buy this album NOW. An awesome mix of great great music coming straight from the Big Island of Hawaii. If you have taste in music, buy this album riiiiight now. You may not hear much of them now, but you definitely will in the very near future. This album's gonna blow up!"
5,That's What I'm Talking About,"This is one of my favorite Cds. My favorite song of this Cd is Faceplant. This is also one of the only Cds that I have that I can listen to without skipping a single song. I believe this is the best of Pepper's Cds, but I have not heard Give N It so I might be wrong so I plan to get that Cd next. Pepper is one of my favorite bands no doubt. If you haven't heard of them yet, I suggest you check them out."
5,Unbelievable music and poetry,"Sherri is fantastic, and this is my favorite of her albums. The emotion in her voice, the truth in her lyrics, the quality of her songwriting. Can't say enough about it. This one will move you."
5,Brilliant,"This book not only maps out the territory of advanced Capitalism, but it provides a political philosophy that is a ""Negri beyond Negri"". Although Dyer-Witheford draws a lot of ideas from Antonio Negri and the Italian autonomist tradition, he surpasses them with his excellent analysis of postindustrial capital. Moreover, Negri's most recent work (with Michael Hardt), ""Empire"" falls short of Dyer-Witheford's ""Cyber-Marx"" which is more realistic, practical, concise and defensible than Negri has ever been. This book is worth buying by anyone interested in the realities of technological society."
1,Over priced,"These are Hoyle's Super Jumbo playing cards #1223. The exact same cards are available at a much lower price through this same website as ""Extra large Print Playing cards.I purchased both at $9.84 & $6.61 respectively."
5,Excellent Cantonese Dim Sum!,"If you've ever had really good Dim Sum, and I'm not talking about Americanized-grocery store type--I mean, really good Dim Sum--this is the cookbook for you! Growing up in a family filled with traditional Chinese cooking, this book has the recipes down to a ""T"". Time consuming, but all good food naturally is...it is always well worth the hard work and love."
1,"If you buy from Beach Audio, you will not receive what you ordered","Product not as advertised. Ordered Magellan windshield mount #980823 but received 980799, which is an older, cheaper version that was simply relabeled and sold. Makes me wonder why Beach Audio doesn't have a picture of the product, even though all other Amazon sellers do.Though guy at Beach Audio said he would send me UPS shipping labels to return the items, no other attempts were made to satisfy the customer, nor have I received the shipping labels. The burden to correct this should not be left with the customer. Do not buy this item from Beach Audio."
5,Great item RM 700,"I have a Road-mate 700. Updated to a 760 by down loading took four hours, cost $99.00 now has all the perks the 760 has. The unit still has the smaller hard drive all around. The unit has served me well with very minor miss step on unknown dead end streets. It is now supposedly loaded with maps of Hawaii, United states,Canada,Mexico, Puerto Rico.In California it is not permitted to stick any thing to the windshield glass. I have a mount for the air conditioner louvers, this will cool down the unit and in four hours the unit will shut down,it takes about three hours for it to warm up,[ don't throw it out the window yet] then your on off switch will work. If the air conditioner is not used then you are home free.I would never go to any unknown areas with out it. This I believe to be one of the best units available I love it, and I give it Five stars,it's now out of production,, how sad."
4,Magellan 980823 Windshield Mount,Much better and stronger product than the original.Fit is a little tight between the mount and the universal cradle. Has to be almost forced on.
5,A Terrific Guide to Shedding Post-Pregnancy Pounds,"This book presents a straightforward and easy to follow plan for losing post pregnacy pounds - and we all know how depressing those can be. Personal trainer Greg Waggoner explains a step by step way to get your old body back - and its actually working!

The workouts are time-efficient, well-illustrated, and there are some that include the baby. Also, a balanced diet is stressed as important part of breastfeeding, as well as losing pounds - there are fast, healthful and easy recipes at the back of the book."
2,Book is Annoying,"I found the exercise plan to be a little too complicated and hard to stick with. I was constantly having to check the book for how many sets and reps I was supposed to do. If your as sleep deprived as I am you can understand it is difficult to remember when it changes on a weekly basis. I bought a pilates video and it was much easier to do and had faster overall results.Also, if you have just had a baby, it is likely that you have some weight to shed in order to see these new and improved abs. His weight loss plan is sad, eat less and do some cardio. I didn't need a book to tell me that. He also doesn't really address breastfeeding other than saying you need more calories.And is there anything more annoying than a man telling you how important Kegels are? If he hasn't experienced childbirth then he shouldn't be telling me how Kegels are a fix all for everything that changes after birth."
2,Not Great,"The moves in this book are great, but they are hard to do on a continual basis. Keeping up with it is hard. Not seeing progress is even the main reason I gave up. I did Denise Austin's bounce back after baby and it does what this book does 3x over. She knows what she is doing."
2,not a great resource,"I wasn't impressed withthis book. For one thing, it appeared to be a bad photocopy of an original book! Very weird.That strangeness aside, the book itself was not very helpful to a new mom. I didn't get the feeling that the author had any experience with what it is like to be post-partum and trying to get some exercise in around nursing, sleeping (hah) and all the other stuff rasising a newborn involves.I would get a good postpartum DVD before ever using this book."
4,Love this thing,"*update* 11/21/12This product will now RIP. The battery started to die some months ago, but I kept it around in AC mode. And finally it was shutting off by itself sporadically once every few days.Original review:I had to get a UPS for my computer because of all the thunderstorms we have around here. It's been a couple of years and this thing is still running smoothly. I don't know how many times we've had power outages and those grayouts where my computer would've abruptly been cut off from power if this thing hadn't been here. Quite a bit of money, but well worth the peace of mind."
3,softcore horror flick,This review is for the Amazon VOD rental of this film. This is a OK take on theDr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde theme. Gabriella Hall is plain jane Jackie Hyde and BlytheMetz stars as her sexy evil alter-ego. Hall is alright in her role and Blythe Metzis very curvy and also a pretty decent actress. She is very good as the psycho babe.This film has plenty of female nudity and a fair share of bloody mayhem. This flickalso has a scene in which a stripper suffers death by cunnilingus. That's a new oneon me. This is by no means a great movie but is worth the VOD rental price.
1,Worse Movie Ever Made,"I don't think I have ever seen a movie that is as bad as this one! You don't really expect much from softcore, ""Hard-R"" movies and that's OK. All most of us ask for are cute actress, with B+ bodies and we're happy. There were only a few slender actresses with lines in this movie.Gabriella Hall has gotten FAT--I'm talking 30+ pounds fat. It is very disappointing. She's only 29, maybe 30, but she looks 45.Blythe Metz, who plays Jacqueline, is pretty, but has flabby boobs, and is much too curvy for this line of work.The most interesting part of the entire movie is the audio commentary. Unfortunately, Gabriella's commentary reveals a GED-education. I'm glad I got this movie from the library!Don't buy or rent it unless someone holds agun to your head."
4,A practical discussion of widowhood,"Drawing from her own personal experience, Betty Jane Wylie gives the reader an inside view of what it is like to be widowed at middle age. Although dour at times, this book is mainly filled with practial advice for the newly widowed. Information is given on finance and employment, relationships with friends and children, companionship and sex, travel, household repairs, etc.This book is unique, in that it is not a detached, academic look at the grieving process. Wylie's personal anger and pain at her loss are evident. Although this book is depressing to read at times, it also seems realistic and practical."
3,"Works fine, hanging's an issue","In general, it works fine, no complaints. The hook is hard plastic and rather narrow on the underside, however, so it has a tendency to slide down my showerfixture until it hits the showerhead. Not a big deal, and I didn't expect perfection for my ten bucks, but not a 5-star product."
4,Nice!,"Woah, This is a STEAL! For this price it's the best shower radio out there! You may think it sounds like it has a lot of static when your not in the shower but soon as you hang it up in the shower it clears up. I would say it's about 80% clear! I love this radio and for this price you cannot go wrong. Buy this today, before it's gone!"
2,Too hard to tune,"This radio doesn't have any digital tuning and no antenna so it's hard to tune a station and as soon as your hand moves away from the radio, it loses reception. The speakers are also very tinny! I returned it..."
1,You get what you pay for/Stay away from this one.,"Wanted a simple radio for the shower and thought this one would do the trick.PROS: Small size and easily hangable.CONS: Sound quality isn't that great, then again, it is only a $9.99 radio. Tuning into your favorite radio stations isn't easy, so if you are like me and enjoy AM and FM, switching between the two and finding the specific station is a pain, once again, it is only a $9.99 radio. If you listen to one station and one station only this shouldn't be an issue.MAJOR CON: After a little over one month of ownership (past the thirty days that I could return it to amazon.com) the volume control is shot, regardless of how much you move the dial it stays at the loudest volume. Still no word from the manufacturer on what I am suppose to do with the radio.My Advice: I would NOT RECOMMEND this radio. Poof, $9.99 I'll never see again."
2,There are better choices than this book to improve your 1P,"Save your time and money and instead read Winning One Pocket by Eddie Robin and the companion book Shots Moves and Strategies (also by Robin). Both books are out of print and expensive, but in this case you get exactly what you pay for. My biggest problem with Upscale One Pocket is that it does not present enough examples of responding to the break or provide enough moves and strategies to beat even B players. The book has few decent illustrations, which really makes it difficult to learn any shots, and in many other ways it just doesnt get it done. Concepts such as playing the score, the value of taking intentional scratches, skill level in choice of shot etc are all given minimal treatment. After reading this book my one- pocket game did not improve and it did not inspire me to get on a table and practice any particular shots. The two previously mentioned Eddie Robin's books improved my game two balls and I am still learning from them."
1,Another thumb down for lexen electric juicer,"Trying to save money and live healthy by juicing, I bought this Lexen Electric Healthy Juicer from the internet. The first one that was shipped to me, had problem starting. After calling the support, I was told to check the fuse. But the fuse was OK. So the support sent me a replacement. The replacement also had problem starting. I figured the contact between the fuse and the contact point inside the juicer, was not good. Hence I jammed a small ball of aluminium foil into the fuse hole to ensure tight fit contact circuit through the fuse. It worked. The juicer can be switched on reliably. I used it to juice wheatgrass and it often got jammed and needed to hit on the reverse button to reverse the augur to unjam the juicer. But after the fourth juicing session, the reverse action of the juicer gave up on me. Now I just print out online coupon whenever I can find it, and go to Jamba Juice store to get my healthy drink."
1,low yield,"I recently purchased this product and was disappointed to find that there is more juice going into the waste tray than into the drip tray. I actually thought I had them in the wrong places. After reading instructions, tightening and pondering I have come to the conclusion that I am doing things correctly. I can actually wring the pulp out with my hand and get a significant yield just by wringing it. I wish I had read the reviews. I will still use this for wheatgrass but I will put the pulp through twice and then send it through my jack lalanne with my other veggies.2 thumbs down!!!VERY DISAPPOINTED. You MUST grow your own wheatgrass in order to cover the loss in cost with this machine."
1,THUMBS DOWN!!,"This juicer just does not work well. It is slow, messy, and not worth the money. I am sending it back."
1,Wasn't working out of the box,"When a product arrives and comes out of the box not working, it's a bad sign. I returned the product and decided against purchasing an electric juicer."
4,Great juicer,real great vegatable juicer has lots of fine pulp ^ makes great nut butters except almond (haven't tried says their too hard to turn into butter for this juicer)- fruits come out very pulpy like runny applesauce have not tried every thing i want to yet ----wheatgrass i have no idea yet
3,Not as good as I thought....,I thought I was getting a bigger more informative book for the price I paid for a used in new condition book. I paid 49.95 plus shipping. You could get this advice from a renal nutritionist. I would not have paid this price had I known what is in it .
1,can I rate it as a negative number?,"this was so dumb. whoever made this must be laughing all the way to the bank.it has very repetitive music that is also boring and awful. like a mockery from saturday nite live.some womans voice in the background saying stuff like ""ok ladies now tell your man he's Your Man, or ""ok ladies gently rub your mans neck cause he's had a hard day"".I previewed and threw it away before playing it for my wife.please, please no matter how sexy the description- dont buy this, it isnt sexy or provocative, its just sad. ridiculously sad."
1,Don't waste your money.,This products simpley does not work as advertised! The white light is not very bright and the colored LED's do no make blood stand out!
5,carnivore blood tracking light,I bought this light for my husband to take hunting so he wouldn't lose any more deer at dusk. Since it isnt hunting season right now he hasn't gotten to use it yet. He has though played around with it and he says that he thinks it will work great.
3,it was a gift,"I really can't say much about the product, it was a gift for my boyfriend and he seems to be happy with it.I received the item with in a week so that was nice and had no problems with the seller."
1,Buy something else,"I, too, thought my 16-month would delight in seeing Elmo pop out. But the question became ""WHEN?"" It takes way too long and I have to crank it a few times, fast, so my son doesn't get bored with it. It also goes off without any warning. We'll be watching tv and hear the VERY LOUD music. No volume control, takes too long for Elmo to appear and just plain annoying."
3,Not fun for parents,"My 18 month old son does like this toy, but I find it annoying. It takes too long for Elmo to pop out. He gets upset when after turning the handle 10 times, Elmo hasn't popped out yet. Then he gives it to me to make Elmo come out. He did figure out how to pry open Cookie's face to make him come out that way."
2,Elmo doesn't hold child's interest,"Although my 1 yr old and 2 yr old were initially attracted to this toy for the music and giggly noises it makes, it did not hold their interest. It takes to many turns of the handle to get Elmo to pop out. My 1 yr old will watch when the music starts. But then she turns away and doesn't see Elmo pop out, because it takes so long and doesn't hold her interest. My 2 yr old gets frustrated turning the handle, and starts turning it the other way. Then it takes even longer."
2,Don't bother,"It takes sooo long for Elmo to pop up, my son lost interest. Either that, or he just forces it to open (which is really easy to do too).. On top of that it's very sensative to touch, so if something moves in the toy box, it will start to giggle (really annoying). I've never been soo disapointed with a Sesame Street product before."
1,Frustrating to use,"It takes FOREVER to get Elmo to pop out. By the time the very annoying song plays 10 times my one year old son is crying and frustrated because Elmo has STILL not popped out. It is also impossible for a small child to use because of the tiny turn handle. I can hardly grasp hold of it, let alone a child! This toy is a complete waste of time and money."
1,Things that go bump in the night...,"...Sure do set this toy off. We have had it for a while now -but the batteries have been permenantly removed. Ours used to play music all by itself in the middle of the night if it had been cranked just so the day before. It took us a while to figure out why our then 3 yr. old started waking up terrified. Now we know. It's cute but takes many cranks to pop up, and, once it is in just the right position, will play music with just about any movement! (even something being blown on it by the fan in the middle of the night) Don't waste your money...Get something else-anything else!"
2,Goes off in the middle of the night!!!!,"My son loves Elmo so when I saw this inexpensive Elmo toy, I thought, why not?! It DOES take forever to pop up, which frustrates me and my son. Also, it will just be lying in the playpen, minding it's own business and Elmo starts his muffled laughing, which is kinda creepy if you are up late at night!!! Don't waste your money on this mostly-frustrating toy."
2,"Our daughter cried, then chucked it!!!","Our 16 month old LOVES Elmo. So when I saw this toy in the store I couldn't wait to get it home to her. After showing her how it worked, (yes, it takes too many cranks to see Elmo)she tried it herself and became so frustrated, she began to cry and whipped it across the room. (She has a temper) Anyways, I remember laughing and thinking how this all backfired on me. She doesn't even want it in her toy box so save your money for something else."
2,Just won't pop...,"It giggles in the toy box unexpectedly, and when my son tries to wind it, it keeps going, and going and going....until I have to pry it open! It's very durable and has been thrown many times in bouts of frustration. To my amazement, when it landed, it still didn't pop up!"
1,A pain in the mule,"As mentioned before, it takes a long time to get Elmo to pop up UNLESS you hold it at an angle. On a flat surface, it will never pop up.A poorly made toy. It does not even deserve to the on the Island of Misfit Toys."
2,no giggle's for mommy,"I bought this toy for my son because be loves cookie monster. I'm sorry to say that the sounds this toy made were so enoying I had to finally hide it, then give it away. Was a great concept for a toy, but the sounds they can really improve. thanks for reading"
2,Will frustrate you before it amuzes you.,"My daughter loves elmo. However, it take so many turns to get him to appear she either looses intrests or insists that I do it over and over."
2,Very annoying!,We bought this toy for our son thinking he would love it but he doesn't even play with it. It goes off all on it's own at the worst possible times. Spend your money on something else!
1,Not an ideal toy,"My daughter got this toy as a gift, and although she kind of liked it, my husband and I found it very annoying. My daughter liked the music and when Elmo popped up, but like the other people have said, it takes awhile for Elmo to actually ""pop"" up. My daughter would get frustrated when it didn't open after turning the handle a few times. The worse thing about the toy is that it does go off at odd times. It doesn't have an off button, so you can turn it off. We have to put it away from other items because if her other toys happen to hit against it (like in her toy chest) it'll start playing. This is one Elmo toy I wish my daughter never received. Don't waste your money."
5,One of the best albums I bought this year,If you like the group and you like fast dance music this is the album for you. It is a rocking set of tunes that will make you speed if played in your car. I really enjoyed the classic dead or alive sound modernized with that 140 bpm dance sound. Great stuff!
3,A Guilty Pleasure.,"Hey! This album has been released in the States by Cleopatra Records. It contains a couple new versions of ""Spin Me Round"", covers of ""Rebel Rebel "" (Bowie) and ""Picture This"" (Blondie), plus much more new, original material. It has its moments but some of the songs are less than spectacular. Its great to see Pete Burns back at work! He looks madder, badder, and more dangerous to know than ever! He is something wild and wonderful, something new and awesome, and that something is spelled: N-U-K-L-E-O-P-A-T-R-A!!"
3,LAST EFFORT SPINS YOU LIKE A RECORD THEN TOSSES YOU OFF.,"Dead or Alive the group who ruled the dance circuit in the mid 80s with ""Brand New Lover"", ""You Spin Me Round (Like A Record)"", etc....are back with their latest effort ""Nukleopatra"".Which is a fair effort at best....They bring back a new version of ""You Spin"" which is good, but I love the original...other favorable songs are ""Sex Drive"" and ""The Right Stuff"".As always Dead or Alive brings back that sound, but it just doesn't fit with todays time...I say if you are not a die hard Peter Burns fan, go buy the ""Rip It Up"" greatest hits, otherwise if you are a die hard fan, it will bring back those memories.......of the mid 80s...of course the songs are not standouts like ""Lover Come Back"", ""Something In My House"", etc., but they try."
1,"If I could give it ZERO stars, I would.","Do not buy this - the Japanese issue - CD. The sound quality is terrible! Unless you're a die-hard Dead Or Alive fan - and I mean REALLY DIE-HARD! - buy the U.S. orange-cover edition of Nukleopatra instead. Nukleopatra itself is an excellent Dead Or Alive album, as good as (but NOT better) either Youthquake or Mad, Bad and Dangerous To Know... and it's BETTER than Fan The Flame, Pt. 1 and Nude."
1,Their worst album ever made,"Oh my god ! What happened to Pete Burns and his crew ? Don't they know any more how to make good music ? Over are the times when they wrote songs like ""You spin me round"" or ""Something in my house"". The songs on this album are cheapest production, children ""lalala"" songs and nothing to be proud of recording them... Dead or Alive is finally DEAD !"
5,Superb hi-energy dance music!,"Years after the masterpiece ""Nude"" Dead or Alive is back with another collection of literate, hi-energy dance trax. Standout songs are: Sex Drive, Picture This (a Blondie cover), and Unhappy Birthday, though 2 remixes of You Spin Me Round are here too, for the unenlightened who still think of DOA as a one-hit wonder! Why did the USA have to wait two years for this album, when it was breaking sales records in Japan??"
4,And I Thought They Were Dead,"I discovered (quite by accident) that DOA were very much ALIVE when I discovered this CD. I know it's a Japanese import, but I didn't care. There are a total of 15 songs on this CD (4 remixes--2 of ""Spin Me"" and 2 of ""Sex Drive""). The two remixes of ""Sping Me"" didn't do a thing for me. DOA will NEVER improve on the 12"" Murder Mix of that song. Other than than, I liked all but one cut, i.e. ""I'm a Star."" I hadn't heard Pete's voice in so long and he didn't appear to have lost a thing.The reason I didn't give this CD a 5 is because of the sound quality--very poor on some cuts. I could have the volume turned just about ALL THE WAY UP on my stereo system (and my system isn't cheap), but yet several of the songs sounded muted--some to the point of being soft.Other than that, I recommend this one. Nukleopatra and Sleep With You are standouts."
5,"Wow, incredible!",The manga is just too good. I have continued to enjoy this manga ever since the first volume. Anyone who hasn't already bought this should.
1,"Not very good sound. Great idea, poor execution","I've been searching high and low for some good (not great) headphones that will stay put when I run, and wouldn't break the bank. After purchasing and returning about a dozen different kinds, I saw an article on the Arriva, and figured I would give them a try.The sound quality is horrible. Very tinny sounding, and they don't stay in very well (I tried the different sized ear fittings to no avail). I would say that this is definitely a 1.0 product.I really wanted these things to solve my problem, but I'm out of luck, and out 30 bucks. I guess I'll have to spend $50+ in order to get something that I like."
2,Not so great!,"I bought these headphones hoping I could finally find a pair that would stay in my ears while I jog. These headphones don't completely fall out like the others I've had but they do not stay in the ears snuggly enough and they tend to slide out slightly so I end up constantly pushing them in while I jog. That's not the worse part, though. The worse part is that after just a few months, one side quit working altogether. I've written an email to the company but they only warranty the things for 30 days so I'm not holding out much hope. I paid $30 for these things and am very disappointed that they quit working so soon."
2,Loose while running,"I bought these because I thought they were the answer to loose hanging headphones while running. The problem with these is that it doesn't hug you head as in the pictures, specially during long runs (12 miles). A solution I found was withArriva cordless iPod Shuffle 2G headphones with in-ear earbud, regular blackinstead.That headset by Arriva has a tighter fit. So, I bought it and instead of putting an iPod Shuffle 2G, I simply put aCables To Go 13787 3.5 mm Male/Female Stereo Audio Extension Cable (6 Feet, Black)to the headset, and plugged it to my iPod nano (or whichever you own) and presto!"
1,Meh...,Poor quality product. Doesn't seem to fit on my head correctly. Instructions say you can adjust the product but it's effective.
2,Not as Good as Advertised,"Arriva boasts its Sports Stereo Wired headphone provides unparalleled comfort and fit for its price.In fact, its weight and design make it bulky to wear and to carry when not in use. The fit was no better than more traditional over-the-ear headphones. Lastly, the touted ease to reconfigure the headphone for a custom fit is much trickier than the promotional material asserts. Indeed, I have yet to bend or twist the wires into a shape that overcomes the flaws in the headphone's design."
1,The photo of these says it all...,"Look closely at the photo for this product... the headphones have no shape to them... Each side has a mind of it's own. Impossible to adjust for a proper fit... again, you can see this by just looking at the photo of the product...The plastic around the ear is very uncomfortable. The headphone piece pops out of your ear. And if by some miracle, you do get them right... store them in a glass case... Drop them on the seat and they will lose what little shaping you achieved..."
1,bad idea,"this product is just a bad idea it does not fit well, and the springy like action pops them right ouy of your ear"
1,"Doesn't work on my14"" Delta Bandsaw and stated it did!","This item is advertised to fit all Delta 14"" band saws and would not work on mine. Then after numerous emails trying to get Amazon to understand that this was their error and they should be responsible for shipping the item back, they agreed However, they ended up charging me $9.99 to ship the item back! Don't waste your time or money!"
5,"Works great, Be Aware of its configuration",This hood works great for me though I had to modify it. I purchased this as a replacement to a much older oven hood which had its power brought in through the left hand side. This hood did not have the option to bring the power in through the left. I got around this by using a drill to create a new hole in the proper location.
5,Nice Buy,"I bought this for a house that I was selling, so I wanted to keep the cost down. I was very satisfied with the fan when it arrived. Great value for the money."
4,I would buy it again!,The low speed does not provide very much suction but otherwise it works well; it was very easy to install and GREAT price!
3,Fine for a temporary hood...,"I'm renovating next year, but needed something to replace the failed hood in my kitchen. This is economically priced and works fine. Motor is pretty small, and for many things you need to run it on ""high"" to clear the air, which is somewhat loud.If you cook a lot of greasy/smokey food, (which I really don't), you may want to look at something more powerful."
4,good product,easy to install. Quality seems to be fine. Installed into a basement with duccting to the outside. Typicla open motor design and sheetmetal is the right gauge so I think it is a good deal.
5,Excellent Program on Social Skills Training,"This is a wonderful program to teach specific social skills to children who have difficulty interacting effectively with their peers. It is most appropriate for students diagnosed with hHgh Functioning Autism, ADHD, Asperger's Syndrome,Non-Verbal Learning disabilities or Pervasive Developmental Disorders."
3,Buy the full season already!!,"These episodes are great but if you're really a ""Friends"" fan, you'll be better off with any of the Seasons 1-4 that are already out on both VHS and DVD (Season Five soon to come out!!)These ""Best of.."" series isn't bad at all but wouldn't you rather see it all??"
5,Oust Air Sanitizer from Amazon,I do not understand why the grocery stores in my area no longer carry this product. It is wonderful and I have a can in each of my bathrooms and have taken several for the bathrooms where I work. I spray the toilet bowl instead of the air and have been doing it that way for several years. It works beautifully. I have also used it to rid my condo of cooking smells when the weather prevents me from opening windows. It does NOT put a smell on top of a smell - it actually gets rid of it.
3,"Buen producto, pero.......","Sin duda es un buen producto, particularmente a mi no me gusta el aroma que tiene. La funcion de eliminar los malos olores la cumple como ninguno. Yo prefiero el de etiqueta celeste, que no recuerdo el aroma que representa,"
2,Not what I expected.,"I got this package on time, and in good shape. The price was alittle to good too be true. And it was. The Flash is what I payed for, cheaply made, but, it works good. The problem showed up when I installed the Hot Cable to My XTi inorder to extend My Flash. The Cable mounting clip got stuck in the Hot Connect on the Camera. The Maker of this part made this plastic slid too thick for the guide on the cameras hot connect. I was able to get it out of the mount,but, I had to have a Camera Guy do it. He said it was just cheaply made. Now I need to find a better made Hot Cable.Patrick"
1,Bottle that they sent were plastic,"These bottles were listed as being glass, after receiving my order from Med-Vet International I got plastic ones. I called them, they informed me that they did not have glass ones only the plastic. They offered a refund on the bottles. Be aware if you are looking for glass!Not very happy, out my time and shipping cost..."
1,"wrong item sent, and I have to pay return shipping","I normally read reviews before ordering, but this time I guess I didn't think. Ordered two dozen dropper bottles, the photo clearly shows a bottle with a bulb and a glass dropper tube, exactly what I wanted. What I received was two dozen bottles with some kind of plastic plug insert that might work with a squeeze bottle, but not with a glass bottle.So I initiated a return through Amazon and received a return label that requires ME to pay for return shipping. WHY? I didn't make the mistake, why am I being penalized for their error?So, belatedly I went back and looked at their reviews. It seems LOTS of folks have had the same experience I had. What a shame. I will be complaining directly to Amazon."
5,Great Productg,The product was exactly what I needed. It is strong and sturdy and is great for a variety of uses.
2,Droppers are to short - wasted products,"I thought droppers reach the bottom of the bottle. But that is not the case, the droppers are clearly too short - leaves about 1/2"" of your product unusable. Then after reading about others issue, my bottles shipped to my house just fine. But ,the way they came, i was surprised that they were not broken, due to packing method. Very disappointed . I'm not returning them due to the reviews by other with bad service. I just won't ever buy from them again....."
5,Review,"Very Friendly company. It was very easy to contact the company. Personable, quick, lots of choices! I called them direct and was able to figure out my best options."
3,Medicine bottle with dropper.,"These were satisfactory and glass quality of the bottles were good, though one can get them at half the cost if you buy more in bulk from a bottle company. I was disappointed with the droppers. They were plastic and I much prefer glass."
4,Not -exactly- what was expected...but still great!,"It's a great book to be sure, but after reading through it I was disappointed to see that not all of the photos taken are included. Apparently I'd misread this, but none of the photos/actors on this page are in the book. I was really looking forward to those ones, but I'm not saying the book wasn't worth buying! It's full of great expressions and high-quality photos, and it's very interesting to look through and to own."
5,This book is adorable!,"This book is so cute! The textures are varied and fun for baby, and the story is cute - I don't mind reading it over and over."
5,The book was practical and broadly-based.,"I have had two copies of this book, and have let both of them get away from me. Unlike most ""how to"" fly fishing authors, Charles Waterman focuses with a wide angle lens which takes in all of sport fishing, not just fishing for trout. Like Ray Bergman's Trout, this book is useful for the beginner as a primer, and for the journeyman as a reference. I hope that Modern Fresh and Saltwater Flyfishing is back in print soon."
4,Heartbeats of the faceless,"In this brave book, it's as if you have this magical satellite and you're focused in on this certain place and time, observing the weak, but tough... surviving the strong, yet cowardly... in a dance of fates fickle design. Way too many heart-wrenching moments and longer periods of devastation to mention in this ultimately surreal story. The reason I felt this book deserved four stars and not five stars is overly critical, not enough reflection, slightly weak tone, and real abrupt ending. Read this book and realize how trivial and insignificant most things are that people waste life's short precious time on . Also read:First They Killed My Father: A Daughter of Cambodia Remembers (P.S.)."
5,Compelling Account of a Tragic Time,"Chanrithy Him has told an authentic account based on her story. It replicates the hundreds of thousands of suvivors of the genocide regime of Pol Pot. The story is simple in the story telling, which makes it all the more compelling. For anyone interested not only about this sad time, but also interested in the struggles of these traumatized newcomers, even after 25 to 30 years, it is a must read."
5,One girl's experience,"This is a heart wrenching story of one family's experiences during the Khmer Rouge regime. It is well written. Be prepared for the emotional impact. It is a story of sorrow, survival and triumph. A window into the depth of cruelty of the human race but also the resilience."
1,Very disappointing,"I bought this CD for a friend who has cancer. I promised her that I'd review anything before sending it to her. Boy, am I glad I did!It is frustrating to listen to and seems to me to break the rules of guided meditition. He mentions a lot of negatives, i.e. ""this is not a time for guilt or fear."" Well, of course it isn't, we're trying to ""enhance"" the immune system, not depress people. My opinion is bringing up such words or ideas during a healing meditation is bringing them into awareness. The sub-conscious mind doesn't understand that this is NOT a time for guilt...it just hears ""guilt.""I was looking for something that would talk about positives and focus on healing. This is not one I'd recommend."
1,Love His Books - Not At All Impressed With This CD,"I have many meditation tapes I love, but this isn't one. I love all of his books, so I thought it would be great... but I expected more relaxation and visualization techniques, more hypnosis kind of work in healing. This did nothing for me."
5,Ignore the De Vere Nonsense,"For an account of Golding's Ovid, see Ezra Pound's essay on Elizabethan translators. Uncle Ez was excessive to call it ""the most beautiful book in the English language,"" but not by as much as you'd think.The De Vere comment by the previous reviewer is a reference to a fringe element that ascribes Shakespeare's writings to De Vere. Consider it to have the scholarly value of ascribing authorship to the Men in Black (see Schoenbaum's *Shakespeare's Lives* for an account of this movement)."
5,Purely AMAZING!!,We just saw this DVD in church today! Wow! WOW! WOW! Unbelievable! Highly recommended! Especially to people that have a hard time believing in Jesus Christ and/or have a hard time believing just how big Jesus Christ is! Very recommendable!!
5,Incredible!,"This is a DVD about our solar system. Sounds boring...right? You will be absolutely amazed and shocked at the visual material on this DVD! Louie Giglio does an excellent job of describing and hi-lighting God's greatness! IF a God can speak, create and set our vast solar system into existence, what can He do with our small problems? A must see!We have given out over 200+ of these DVD's. We always receive phone calls and cards stating what an incredible DVD. The recipients we gift then share the DVD with others. They have it shown at their churches...we have been told that many have accepted Christ from viewing this DVD! There is only one true living God...and He spoke, created and set the world into existence."
5,How Great is our God,This video is incredible. A very good lecture and slide presentation on the presence of God. It should remove any doubt you may have in having a belief in God the Father.
5,Awesome....a must see DVD!,This is an amazing DVD presentation. You can't imagine how small we are....as a golf ball....compared to the other heavenly bodies in our universe. You have to see this presentation.
5,Great,"this DVD was shown to me by a friend and when i did actually see it myself i jus love it ,.....this is so amazing"
2,Charismatic preacher,"The message is great, but the preaching is lousy. I would prefer a good homily by my pastor or a discussion on EWTN by Fr. Mitch Pacwa or Fr. Benedict Groeschel than to watch/listen to 5 minutes of this. I would rate it one star but the message is too great for that."
1,misuse of time,"One more lesson for me; do not buy any DVD without preview. I bought this DVD because it was given 5 stars by viewers. On scale of rating I will give ZERO (0). It is absolute unprofessional and amateurish. One guy go running on dark amphitheater with golf ball and yelling big numbers, which viewers will not remember 5 minutes after listen to. I do not understand how anybody can give this DVD even one star? Except that it was watched in tent in Afghanistan in 1930. Showing misleadingly colored pictures by NASA people, does not make them great. What misuse of time for such primitive show?"
5,Incredible DVD! Awesome message and images from the Cosmos,"North Point Community Church's Louie Giglio provides a breathtaking view of our universe coupled with an outstanding message. Despite the unfathomable size of God's universe he still knows us by name.Very powerful, highly recommended for youth and adult Sunday School classes, along with ""Indescribable"". Our class has watched it twice already."
5,You won't be sorry,"This will help anyone get a greater perspective on ""how great"" our God is! Excellent presentation. We need to be reminded periodically that there is sooo much more than our little view."
5,Awesome!,What a beautiful and wonderfully awesome presentation of How Great Our God Is! Recommend it to all audiences to reinforce in an exciting and adventurous way what an awesome God we serve.
1,Be Cautious of Shipping Charge,"Make sure you check the shipping cost on this product. I made the mistake of doing a one-click order. Later that day, I found that this company charged me almost double the cost of the product in shipping. Even though I gave them ample time to cancel the order, they shipped anyway. This is not a good value."
5,The best Barney video we own,Kids love this video. I'm a home daycare provider. Over the yrs I have collected over 100 kids videos. Barney Songs seems to entertain my daycare kids ages 14 months to 5 yrs greatly. My kids cheer when I put this video on. I'd say it's in the top 10 favorite videos of my daycare kids. This a must have video for anyone who has a Barney fan in their house.
5,This video is great especially for babies!,"This video is a true blessing! I don't know how anyone could make it as a parent without ""Barney Songs"". This video is a definite must have for any Barney lover! The video has scenes from the 1995 ""Barney & Friends"" series episodes including: ""Riding in Barney's Car"" and ""Making New Friends"". It includes traditional songs like Brushing my Teeth, The Friendship Song, The Airplane Song, Please and Thankyou, and much more. And it also includes some of Barney's all-time favorite characters: Shawn, Kathy, Tosha, and Min. I certainly recommend this video to any Barney fan!!"
3,"I like ""More Barney Songs"" better","We had watched ""more barney songs"" before we bought this one. The other one was just much fun to watch and included almost all the songs in this one."
5,Excellent for kids who love Barney,This is a must for all Barney crazy kids. My 18 month daughter just loves the video. She knows how to recognize the cover very well.
2,Only ok,"My son didn't really care for it, it's a bunch of clips thrown together. He prefers "" sing and dance with Barney"" ."
2,Old shows from the mid-90's,"The publish date may be recent, but this is actually an old mash-up of mid 90's shows. My son likes them, but I find them very dated, and I wanted something newer!"
5,"Works well, good quality.","I purchased this item, not wanting to spend a lot on an air nozzle. It came with two interchangeable tips for different air velocities. This product is of good quality and definitely worth the price."
5,God book,"great item, I like this book and highly recommend it, it give one an understanding of what church discipline is. thanks"
5,Great!,I just set the player on repeat and listen to it for hours. Soothing music. Good to pay attention to or just let it be background music. This is a good CD to have.
4,Birthday gift.,"I bought this CD for my daughter for her birthday. I have never listened to it, so can't really review it. My daughter said that she is enjoying it, so I'll give it 4 stars."
3,BEAUTIFUL and RELAXING,The music is beautiful - soothing BUT it does not flow from one song into another. There is a pause and it's almost as if the CD has stopped playing. Other than that I would have rated it 5 stars.
4,Beautiful Music,Authentic music from Hawaii. I have been to Hawaii and heard lots of good music but no slack-key. Iwas rather disappointed. Love this music Keep it up!!!!!!
2,Be Ware,"Be Ware. The musicanship is out standing but if you don't like electric drums (and I don't) the you will be very disappointed.I purchased this Live effort in an attempt to ""Get into "" this band. Whoops. There are 3 substancial traks with a full band and these are outstanding, Somethings Coming, The Song of Dunanan,& Time Marches on |Full band -FANTASTIC- The balace sound like 80's ELP and that God awfull Yes Album UNION. Try Somthing else."
4,An Excellent book on the two remarkable Kemble sisters,"This is a fascinating account of the great British theatrical Kemble family. It includes a remarkable amount of research of this early period (Britain, America, Europe) supported by a large number of personal letters which survived. Ann Blaney is to be complimented on the manner in which the text flows and for the insight into each of the family members, Charles the father the mother and Fanny the actress and tempestous wife and Adelaide, the great singer, one of the best Norma's of that early operatic period when Vincenzo Bellini was still alive and Verdi had not yet emerged on the scene.Basil Walsh"
4,Perfect,This book is exactly what I was looking for. It was recommended to me by an expert knitter and it fills the bill.
2,If you already have a portable knitting reference...,"then you don't need this one. I was disappointed when I browsed this at the local bookstore. Pictures are adequate but not as well done as in Vogue Knitting, Vogue Knitting Quick Reference, or Knitting for Dummies. The information is very basic and just about all of it can be found elsewhere and with better detail. For example, the section on blocking consisted of one sentence, maybe two. Given the variety of methods of blocking and the reasons for each, this should have been 1/2 a page at least. There are much better portable reference sources available.The only positive thing I can really say about this book is that the binding (covered spiral) and size are good for just popping in your knitting bag. Despite the more durable cover, seriously consider VKQR or The Knitters Companion by Interweave over this book."
2,Badly Scratched Product,"I hoped to get this telenovela for language practice purposes, but I can't really utilize it.Many of the DVDs arrive badly scratched and scuffed from the packaging. It seems that it's a recurrent issue as the seller had to issue me a full refund because ALL the other NEW copies they had of it were in bad condition to.It's nice that this is the entire the series rather than a chopped compilation, but really sad that they had to mess up the manufacturing in the process....."
2,azul tequila,first disc was informative but boring. did anyone have the problem i had? end of first disc second side ended when azul came back after being kidnapped and believed dead but rejected by her farher thinking she had been raped and would be shunned by society. disc 2 starts with azul in fine clothing with a fine man at her side & no explanation or surprise to town people or to her now x-boyfriend now with a lady on his arm. azul's x-boyfriend now appears to be doing very well in wine business considering in the last disc he was a poor unkept man. what happened? how did everyone find out and accept her return? and so on.... and so on....other plots appear to have jumped in time with no explanation. i have not rated this because i cannot continue without the missing time in the story.
5,VERY GOOD PRODUCT,"I HAVE ENJOYED THIS PRODUCT, IT WAS ONE OF THE BEST I HAVE BOUGHT AND IT WAS ALL I EXPECTED FROM THE BEGINNING TO THE END. IT WAS IN VERY GOOD CONDITION AND I RECEIVED WHEN I WAS SUPPOSED TO."
4,"no english subtitles- long drawn out story, but I really like it","I like this movie- I love costume dramas and enjoy telenovelas as a chance to work on my Spanish skills. The filming is good, the storyline interesting. Of course it could be edited down to a much shorter version, but I enjoy getting a lot of bang for my buck- there is a lot of movie to watch! As I am watching it it is growing on me more and more- I am only on the second DVD. I would also highly recommend Alborada (I think that was how it's spelled) It's a GREAT costume drama, and has english subtitles."
2,Streetwise + Atlanta = Bad Formula,"I LOVE Streetwise maps, but they are best for tight, walkable cities like London or Montreal. Their detailed formula is great for the pedestrian. The trouble with Atlanta is that it's so spread out, all of the interesting neighborhoods that a tourist may visit are not necessarily close together. So what you get is a large map on one side that's not detailed enough to be useful (and honestly still not large enough to encompass all Atlanta offers) and a map of Downtown, which is woefully inadequate since Downtown is only part of the typical Atlanta experience. It's just not a useful map."
3,Dry but informative,"As a child of the 70s, I happily realize that I missed a very paranoid and chilling period in global history. I've been attempting to understand the history of the Cold War, and this book definitely helped. The readability of the book isn't great; but it's not a novel. The information contained is broad and descriptive, and the timeline is especially informative. I'd recommend it for anyone wanting to have in-depth knowledge of this period in history."
2,Wrong Box,I ordered this product based on the photo on the box and recieved a different one. I don't understand that.
5,The best ideas of activities for babies and toddlers EVER!,This little flip chart includes dozens of ideas for fun things to do with babies and toddlers that require no prep or extra materials. It's for parents and caregivers that are aksing ... WHAT should I do with this little blessing ... I'm running out of ideas! It's a keeper!
4,Visit the wrench guy before assembly!,"I bought this accessory, but could not find the right wrench to install it. So I visited the ""wrench man"" and had to buy a wrench set. The 1 1/4"" wrench is slightly bigger and the 1 1/8"" is too small for the nut. I suspect it is metric. Neither the instructions nor the Delta site have any info on the correct size. Using the 1 1/4"" wrench I tightened it until it started to slip. But it seemed secure and the saw works perfectly."
3,someone didn't do the math,"Install was easy and pretty much works as advertised. After installing however the cord for the switch doesn't reach the motor. The instructions suggest removing a strap that holds the cord to the arm, but that doesn't help, still about 1.5 "" short. Perhaps if you did't have the dust chute installed it would reach, but that seems like a bad idea. I had to drill two new holes in the arm to mount the switch lower."
4,Delta,"Simple to install and setup. I have the older delta, so the round guide bar wasn't right but bought a piece of 7/8 inch hex stock from local welding shop."
3,kids play while moms away.,This fun toy can help you to realize where mom went last year on there honeymoon. maby kids can relate to this new part of barbie never seen before.check out the fun of this island store.
1,it was good until i found out that its homophobic,"I just bought this cd today and i was listening to it on the way home and was really digging it. this is some mighty good thrash. my friend started reading the lyrics to it and discovered much to our dismay that ""mutiliation"" is a song about killing a gay person. Homophobia and songs about violence against the gay community are so ignorant and pointless it makes me sick. This is just as bad as racist song. I will be returning this disc and getting something else. i refuse to own anything that supports violence against, and hatred for, any certain race,sex,or sexual orientation. Its a shame they ruined this awesome metal masterpiece with words of ignorant hatred."
3,Home of the brave,This book is about Japanese children in a camp in Calofornia in 1941-1945 (World War 2). Allen Say uses a lot of descriptive writing in this book. It is very mysterious because we do not know who all the children are. I think this is a spectacular book for all agoes. I also recommend this book for anyone who likes descriptive writing.
1,Disappointing!,"I purchased this tree because I was looking for an old fashioned nostalgic look. The tree itself delivers that look no doubt.....but the LIGHTS~ BEWARE! The tree set up relatively quickly, but I have spent the last four hours trying to get all of the lights to work and there is still one whole section not working! This is the biggest disappointment I have ever had in a Christmas tree. My recommendation would be to skip the so called ""pre-lit"" tree and buy a good quality tree and put high quality lights on yourself. Probably will be quicker that way! If I had not ordered this from Amazon and had bought it locally, I would have loaded it up and taken it back. Now I am stuck with a pretty expensive dud of a tree. VERY disappointing."
4,one problem,"The tree is absoutely beautiful ! Looks better than any artifical tree I have seen. It went together fine,but taking it apart was a major problem.The tubing connections were almost impossible to pull apart with two strong people. It needed WD40 to disconnect them at that. The connecting inserts on the tubing need to be sanded to remove all the paint and greased a bit. They were almost impossible to disconnect with the paint on them.Next time should be an easy job with this taken care of."
4,Great tree,"We call this our forever green tree so we don't refer to it as a fake tree - makes us feel better about not having a real tree we've cut in the North Carolina mountains. We did enjoy this tree, it looked great and was easy to put up and take down. It is on the heavy side, so be sure to get some help. The tree stands a little high in the stand - meaning you can see the trunk (which doesn't look especially real). Overall we're glad to have the tree and will enjoy it for years to come."
4,Last minute purchase turns out to be a great tree.,"If you have loads of ornaments - this is the tree for you!Lots of spacing for ornament placement, garland, etc. Also, loads of lights.Best of all - it looks real.Only negative, the branching could be staggered better in length and location. Had to fuss with it a bit to get it just right, but overall a great tree."
1,piece of garbage,This ring is a piece of garbage bought it wore it 3 times and had it for 3 months and all the stones are falling out and the seller will do nothing about it so do not buy this item and do not buy from this seller
5,great debut album for this southern rock band.,"The above album is the censored version. It is worth picking up because this band has to be heard. Drawing from a sound that will sound at times like Seven Mary Three to Nirvana, the band No Address was hurrled into the spotlight on tour last summer with bands like staind, three doors down, and breaking benjamin. They do sound a bit unoriginal at times to some folks, but that does not discredit a quality sound and very catch tunes that have a good rock force that have not been heard in years. Highlights of this album are the songs Perfect, Too Proud, Walk Away, and When I'm Gone (Sadie). If you want to tune in and crank it up with a southern sizzle pick up this Tallahasse Quintet's debut."
5,Quality Visors,"These visors are quality pieces. Installation was a snap. You can buy the other brand, the ones with the tape, and they are fine, but I feel these have a cleaner look to them, especially if you have chrome trim around the window as these do not make a break in the chrome appearance. They are a bit more money, but if you like a clean look this is what you want. Quick fast shipping through Amazon.com."
4,not a bad thesis,"The end is a bit confusing, but the book offers a great resource for robot mapping and simplification from arrays to polylines and mapping fragmentation using ASRs."
5,Excellent,This book is just wonderful and in perfect great condition for me to learn about insect biology. The text and drawings are very clear.
3,"Decent, but not to my taste in clarinetists","Both Louis Spohr and Carl Maria von Weber write in a very showy style, which Denman makes good use of. The performance is relatively crisp and lively, but I find his technique as a clarinetist to be frequently tedious to listen to. He has a somewhat coarse and open sound, with an occasional vibrato that I just don't like. There are also a couple of rapidly articulated sections with slight tonguing glitches - a forgivable offense in the performance of a Spohr concerto, but definitely undesirable in a recording where they become quite obvious with repeated listenings.All in all, an energetic style with good dynamic range and musical style, but I'd recommend clarinet students (especially those looking to perfect an American style of tone) to look elsewhere."
5,Best Little HDTV,"Very impressive TV - has all the features of more expensive sets, like 2-tuner PIP, 2 component-video inputs for your DVD and Satellite - and the great HDTV picture quality as well. Eight inputs total, will direct access between them.Extra surprises include built-in subwoofer (so movies sound awesome right out of the box) and 4:3-to-16:9 'stretching' that is almost imperceptible. Great menu system and many options. Built-in speakers are beneath the screen, so the footprint is similar to standard 33"" sets (don't have to buy new entertainment center!)One minor drawback to me is the PIP is actually POP, picture-outof-picture. The two images are side by side, but use the screen area inefficiently and no overlapping or PIP option.Would buy another..."
4,i bought it. I like it.,"I am an HDTV advocate. I am so impressed by this standard that I check the HD stations available on my cable system first and add rating points for a program available in High Definition.And this set is an easy, relatively inexpensive introduction to HD. The picture is bright and appropriately, (i.e. extremely) sharp. The sound is remarkable for the set's modest size, and it's size, only a slender bezel surrounds the screen, allows the set to fit in relatively small places."
5,"GREAT HDTV,","just bought this tv thru AMAZON.com for $799 last weekend. Price was a bargain. Cant find it any cheaper. Came two days later. Dont listen to that person who said it takes awile. Ordered on Saturday, got it on Tuesday. Picture is perfect, HD quality is AMAZING. For HD viewing, definetely invest in the DVI cable. Worth the money. For the person who said the picture is tilted, that can be adjusted in the settings. Otherwise I would advise anyone who wants to see great HD quality programs to BUY this tv. You wont be disappointed."
1,Price Change,"Well, I saw this set for $799 on amazon, but when I clicked on the set, it was no longer $799, but $1,039.95. What the heck is going on???"
1,Still waiting...finally got it!,"~I finally received my TV and it is great! It is sleeker than I expected, and it looks much better in person. I love the bass and sound. The sound and picture quality are wonderful and it was a fantastic deal! Highly recommended!"
1,"Broken, Cockeyed, and a Mess","Item came with the picture have sideways. Of course, read the fine print, read the fine print, Amazon does nothing for you, Nothing! So think real, real hard before you purchase a major product over the internet. I now have a piece of garbage in my living room and I am out a thousand dollars. No dealers locally will come to your home unless you bought from them and it weighs a ton. Never, never again!! Beware."
5,Fascinating! Suberb!,"How did the university survive so long? Why?The answer is probably to be found in this series. Some of it is merely intersting trivia, other parts are truly fascinating. The role the university has played in society cannot be underestimated. The series provides an in-depth examination of what makes a university what it is historically.Each of the chapters examines a different aspect of the university. Written by a group of wonderful scholars, the series is an excellent reference as well as a delightful read."
3,Servotron and Man or AstroMan? do it better.,"I love DEVO, I love Surf. DEVO + SURF = GOOD? Well, in the case of the Wipeouters the answer is no. This album has some good cuts but overall its just filler.Also, I have no idea what they were thinking when they recorded this- the album is so clean sounding I could eat off it!!!Anyways, for DEVO/SURF music try Servotron or Man or Astroman?"
3,Sasha,"Well, i usually love Sashas! Sasha is one of my favorite Bratz, but this Sasha REALLY surprised me..She has on too much make up and her hair is kinda not pretty..This is very disapointing for me..Buy Tokyo a-go-go Sasha instead."
1,COPY CAT!!!,HEY HER EXTRA OUTFIT IS A COPY OF THE MY SCENE'S MADISON NIGHT ON THE TOWN OUTFIT!!! EXCEPT THE COLOR IS DIFFERENT!!! GIRLS NIGHT OUT DANA'S HAIR IS MESSY AND THIS COLLECTION SHOWS THEIR PRIVATES AND THEIR SHIRTS ARE TOO TINY!!!
3,Not for XML Novice!,"Definitely not a textbook for XML newbies.You need to learn Python Language before understanding this book, wtf?If you are looking for a quick guide and learning book for XML, you might be disappointed by this paper-brick.Might be a fine reference for XML veterans."
1,Book is god but the most companion Sourcecode is missing!!!,"i agree with the previos Readers, but the most of the Sourcecode downloadable from http://www.garshol.priv.no/ is missing.In most the RSSKIT library from the greatest Artikel in this Book.Also missing some smaller parts like SAXTRACKER and more.It seems also that the Code is almost out of Time."
5,a moving microhistory of life at sea in the XVIII century,"There are two reasons to read this book. First, a marvellous account of life at sea in the 18th century, written beautifully and yet spontaneously by a simple sailor. Second, a moving human microstory of genuine love, adventure and lost hope. The two intertwine magnificently and I could not help identifying with the writer's plight."
3,Good chinese movie,"My husband speaks Chinese for a living and so he likes everything Chinese. He watches Chinese movies to keep up on the language and so therefore the whole family joins him. I did find that this movie was rather confusing and had it not been for my husband explaining it to me, I probably would not have finished it. However, I was pleased by the fact that there was no indication of suicide in the movie. I thought that it was put together very well and that I got to know a little bit more about chinese culture being as that it was made in china and therefore is more accurate towards Chinese culture. I was pleased with the ending. Considering that most Chinese movies end sad, I thought that the ending was actually a happy one. I would recommend watching it with someone who understands the movie if you are not the type of person who understands abstract plots."
4,Hes back and hes proven,"Live performances have always been Numans strong point and he has always paid equal attention to both light and sound. It is for this very reason that his live audio recordings stand up by themselves! This is somewhat of a retrospective set managing to please and excite fans from all eras of his career. From the very first notes, the tension is created, then smoothly maintained right through to the finale. See him live...but if you cant then buy this cd, close your eyes, and imagine youre there! Its well worth the trip!!"
2,not very realistic,"Not overly impressed with this one. If you understand that taking your time to pleasure your spouse, in other words tuning in, and not being selfish save your money."
1,Buyer beware,"Do you know what a clitoris is? Do you know that it can be pleasureable when touched? Congrats, you know everything this book has to offer. I was so angry at the mislead purchase, that I actually felt obligated to warn other potential buyers. I bought this book to learn new ways to please a partner. Instead what I got was a book with a little common knowledge and a whole lot of filling. Written by an obviously submissive man and his dominating wife, most of the book is spent on meaningless psycho babble, instead of good sexual tecniques. It even goes so far as to say a man is unimportant in a relationship. ""What do you get out of this?"", it asks. ""A pleased woman, which is after all the only important part of a relationship"", it basically says.If that's your thing, jump at it. If you are looking for new and exciting ways to please yourself and your partner in bed, look elsewhere."
3,It depends on how you define orgasm,"The emphasis on this book is on a manual technique that involves prolonged direct stimulation of the clitoris. The ""orgasm"" is said to last as long as the woman is focusing on her genital sensation, and may include a number of what I had previously thought of as climaxes or orgasms. A man would have to be very patient and motivated to follow through on this method. Intercourse and oral sex are considered separate events to the manual approach explored in this book. I enjoyed reading it, but it seems a bit specialized."
2,Frustrating,"I've stumbled through a countless number of love-making experiences in my life. I hoped that Steve and Vera Bodansky's, ""Extended Massive Orgasm"" would put an end to that, but it didn't. Since reading this book, I have found myself trying to be a ""Superman"" in the bedroom. But I'm not a Superman, I'm a regular guy, like everybody else, just trying to give and receive a satisfying orgasm.While attempting the suggested techniques, my lover and I were put in some awkward, confusing, and sometimes painful positions. I suppose with a little practice, these techniques could be used to achieve amazing levels of pleasure, but don't expect it to happen overnight."
2,If Offensive Language Is What You Are Looking For...,"My husband and I opened this book and read a note from the authors. It said that they esed widely accepted terms and did not want to offend anyone. Just by skimming over the pages in this book you can see the extended repertiore of vulgar language that is used through out the book. This book is not about making love, it is about ""doing it"" as the book would say. This book focuses a lot on self-pleasuring, and on digital stimulation. All around, this book was not worth the anticipation. We returned it the day after we got it."
5,simply astonishing,I was unaware that it was possible for human beings to experience such long and intense pleasure. I read this book and it described things very logically and responsively. My husband and I tried some of the techniques and the results blew my mind. My ability to feel has increased 100fold since practicing this information. I don't know why this such fantastic and easy to use information has not been more available. I am so pleased with this book that I have bought it for all my friends and even some relatives.
4,Must buy,"I love my new keyboard and mouse! The layout is slightly diffrent the standard keyboard with the delete key, and in a diffrent shape, but other then that it is fine, i got used to that small change very quickly."
5,Good Value for the Money,"Good Value for the money, no problems setting up and using. Comes with easy to use software. Good solid Logitech equipment."
4,I love it!,"I love logitech products, they are very intuitive. The keyboard is great, and the shortcut keys are great. The mouse is a little large for my small hands, but I love this product and bought another for my work computer."
5,Excellent Product,The Logitech wireless keyboard & mouse is an excellent product for anyone replacing their keyboard. It is simple to install and effortless to use. The instant response keys for many operations are great. You cannot go wrong with this product.
3,It's Okay,"I have had this wireless keyboard and mouse for about a year, I am not very picky when it comes to electronics but this unit does have several drawbacks. First the keyboard and mouse looks cheaply made, second the mouse does not have so much range. And lastly the mouse eats up batteries like crazy, it has no on/off button so i always on and needs battery replacement about 2-4 weeks. I had a previous logitech mouse and keyboard, that lasted me over 6 months without needing replacement. Logitech always has some high quality products but this one is on the lower end of the spectrum. Overall the unit is okay, but i will be upgrading soon."
3,"Decent Keyboard/Mouse, But not Bluetooth","Considering the price (with rebate), I am impressed with the quality of this combination package. The keyboard feels good, the mouse works well, and the wireless set-up eliminates desktop clutter. However, the range of this wireless transmitter (not bluetooth) is fairly short... this was evident when I attempted ""sofa surfing"" on a large screen TV. I am still looking for a keyboard with better range, for that application."
4,Good choice for the money,"If you're looking for a no-bells cordless set that is lightweight and easy to set up, this is the best I've found for the money. The mouse works fine I'm only slightly dissatisfied with the size and compactness of the keys. I use a keyboard all day so this it's an adjustment to get use to the spacing difference each day. But I got this one to work while on my treadmill so the size is perfect. The batteries seem to be holding up well. The hot keys are a nice feature too."
3,Good Price,This works good as long as you dont expect too much distance. If you keep the keyboard within 10-12 feet of the transmitter it's great. If you don't have a strait shot it starts missing keys.I was able to configure my setup and I am happy with the product.
2,Disappointing Construction,"Flimsy, likely fragile, and has rattles inside. I don't expect it to last very long. Also, the finish of the keys are too reflective of light. The glare is undesirable. Also, the key action lacks a solid, positive feel. (UPDATE: the unit ""died"" after less than a week's usage.)"
4,cordless keyboard and mouse,a little complicated to connect to my computer and I had to purchase an additional USB adaptor for the mosue but it works great and well worth what I paid for it
5,Great keyboard and mouse,"Logitech Cordless Desktop EX110 (967561-0403)This is a great keyboard and mouse. The keyboard is easy to use and set up. There are enough hot keys and F keys to program, but not too much useless other stuff, as was not the case with my old oversized other brand. Size of the keyboard is good, and key strokes are smooth and easy. All is all, I'm well pleased with this purchase, especially at such a low price."
3,Not as good as I'd hoped...,"I like the mouse, not too happy with the keyboard. I got this one because it had the calculator button, which my old Logitech keyboard didn't have, but I've had nothing but problems with it. It's constantly skipping letters and the space bar doesn't always work so I'm always having to go back and correct the mistakes. Also, the buttons on the left side of the keyboard are annoying, especially since I am left handed. The buttons along the top look like cheap plastic too. It was an easy setup though, just plug it in and it's ready to go. If I had it to do over again I'd spend a few more dollars and get a better one."
3,Very cheaply made keyboard/Mouse combo,"Although I never expected much from a cheap price for the EX110. I expected a little better then what I got. The Keyboardis OK but the angle of the keys is a problem if the keyboard is above waist level. I tried to flip down the back feet to angle it toward me more. But it still is a bit awkward to type with. Keys just a little too small. The Mouse is just plain cheap.No horizontal scroll tilt on the wheel, tracking not very good. Battery life OK. The trouble is I would have rather had a decent basic keyboard that types well, then a multi media one that does many things bad."
5,Very good keyboard,"I disagree with people who says that feels cheap, i found it very well made, it's not ergonomic but is comfortable, the keyboard doesn't make a lot of noise, i like the rugged shine finish and yes the wheelmouse makes kind of noise but isn't a big deal, another thing is than batteries last like 4-5 months nice usign it at 2 feet, to keep it working at 5 feet you need to change batteries every 2 months, nice set!"
4,mouse keyboard,"i love the ease of the cordless mouse and keyboard, I have not had a corded mouse in over 2 years because it used to make me feel tied down"
1,Logitech Cordless Desktop EX110 ( 967561-0403,I was using Logitech products for at least 10 Years. This is cheep quality and It broke with in ten days. People do not have time. We expect a company like Logitech shoud produce better products.
3,Logitech IR,Its a good deal for the price....the keybord is too big even the mouse is also not that handy keyboard is cheaply made the keys have a cheap feel too and the buttons on look as they are made of low quality. the product work good for the price paid.......!
4,wireless keyboard,"After a $[...] mfg's rebate, I paid $[...] for this keyboard. The value is good; performance at a very low cost. Certainly worth the money... even at $[...]The mouse is another matter. not very comfortable for me, but usefull non-the-less."
4,Good for the price,"The keyboard is good...easy touch on keys, comfortable. I do not like this mouse. The mouse is too large and it's click is stiff. I would also prefer a 5-button mouse to this one. My old cordless is GE and I am going to interchange them I think."
2,Customer Support - Not so much!,"The first of these that I bought, the feet that holds the keyboard up at an angle broke within two months. This was NOT from hard use. I got a second one by persistence with their customer support. The second one I have had for a year or so and the same thing happened with the feet. Customer support tells me there are no replacement parts for this and since mine is now out of warranty, I'm out of luck. Now I can either lean the thing on a book or buy a new one. I'm going to buy a new one - I promise you it won't be Logitech. If they are going to have cheap flimsy parts that fall apart with normal use, the least they could do is provide replacements. As for other factors, it operated adequately, burned through batteries at a prodigious rate and never did have the feel that is really comfortable. I may have been generous in my star ratings."
2,Very Poor Range,It's a great product for the price as long as you are sitting very close to the sensor. I bought it to use it with my Windows Media PC on big screen so I can sit back on the couch and surf the internet. But the range is very poor and signals are easily lost if any minor electronic device or speaker is in close by.
4,"Works great, but construction is cheap.","This is a good buy for the price. Simple and does the job. But the plastic construction is looking cheap. The delete key makes a slight rattling feel/noise because of it's larger size. Other than that this is good working product. The convenience keys are a plus. They refer to commonly used operations such as opening email / browser, back button, close button etc.. No fancy buttons or options.. light weight and slim. So far happy with it. If you are looking for a simple and budget wireless combo this is a good product to consider."
4,great product for the price,Logitech Cordless Desktop EX110 ( 967561-0403 )We love the flexibility of the wireless keyboard and mouse. They are both very comfortable. The only complaint is that the scroll button on the mouse is very loud! It makes a loud clicky sound when you roll it.
2,Keyboard,"I owned this item for about 6 months and threw it away, the mouse froze up continually, and the keyboard also, could not do a thing with it. I was really disappointed with this product."
5,love this keyboard,"This Logitech keyboard/mouse combo is an excellent buy. In addition to all the regular keys, this keyboard also has enhanced 'F' keys that are pre-programmed to do a number of different tasks like open Word, Excel, and Powerpoint. There are also 'Undo', 'Redo', 'Print' and 'Save' keys. there are also 4 user-programmable keys. To the left of the 'Caps Lock' key are a 'Back' and 'Close Window' keys to control your browser. It took me a while to get used to these, but now I like them. The mouse is nothing fancy: your basic 3-button variety, with the middle button being a scroll wheel. The best thing about these devices is the lack of wires to clutter up the desk/restrain free motion of the mouse."
3,Disappointed,"Though this product is cheap and is functional.I am disappointed in it overall. Like one of the reviewers mentioned, the keys have an overall cheap feel to it. It is not solidly built from the sound of it when you type. The space bar is not sensitive that I have to hit it hard for it to take effect. I have been typing sentences without spaces in between words. I am also not impressed with the mouse. It is a very old model one which is chunky and does not have a good feel to it. I am planning on returning it."
2,Short range only,"The keyboard simply does not work further than a few feet away from the receiver. The mouse has longer range, but it is a bit clunky in use."
2,Disappearing Keys,"I am currently using this keyboard and it's got the same problem as the Logitech keyboard before it: the writing is coming off the keys. Anyone else having this problem? Anyone else think that Logitech's quality control is in the dumper? I'd always been a big fan of Logitech products...you could count on them. No more. Both of these keyboards had the paint coming off the keys very soon after I purchased them. Except this time I'm not going to be suckered in to purchasing a new one just because I can't see half the keys anymore. I'm painting them in with White-out. And when I do need another one, guess what it WON'T be. Come on Logitech...stop going cheap on us."
3,"Cheap, Works, but painful..","Cheap, works fine. The painful aspect of using this ""cordless"" keyboard and mouse, is you need to plug in a nasty little wireless port on to your computer.. i should have read the specs more throughly before choosing this one.."
2,Can't COPY anymore,"Rats, you can notice the delay of the typing. The most annoying: due to the delay or whatever, never could hit Ctrl+C at the same time."
2,N,The keyboard is not good. It makes a lot of noise when I push the button. And one of the bracket on the back broke the first day I received it.
5,EX110 took some getting used to,"good product, works well. pay careful attention to the spacing requirements (8"") from any other electronic device. if not mouse occasionally locks up entire system, requiring system reset."
2,Some keys stopped working temporarily,The keys were actually smaller than those on my Dell Inspiron 8600. But the major problem occurred about 3 weeks after I purchased it. Some keys would stop responding (would have to bang on them) and just as suddenly start to work again. Going to have it replaced and see if it reoccurs
5,Good Combo,"I bought this product for use with an old desktop that I have and it works very well. I love the programmable buttons on the keyboard. Also, the keyboard keys are a little loud, so this probably isn't for a quiet office environment. The mouse has a nice weight to it and works at long distances and on so many surfaces. The receiver is pretty stubborn when trying to tilt it, but it works just as well in any direction as long as it is within 90 degrees of the device(s). Setup is easy, about 2 minutes for me. It is a nice beginning wireless combo.Update: I have recently bought the Microsoft Wireless Laser Desktop 4000 and I find it much more comfortable and convenient than this desktop. Overall, if you can get the Microsoft Wireless Laser Desktop 4000 for less than $40, you should buy that instead."
4,Solid Logitech Performance,"You really can't give five stars to a keyboard/mouse combination -- unless it was telepathic or had a ""pizza"" key. That said, this is a very good keyboard and mouse combo. Note that I am partial to the Logitech keyboard and mouse's physical properties.This purchase was for the daughter-unit up at school. She likes the media buttons and the ease of setup (she may be a Chem major, but she really is pretty PC illiterate, much to the chagrin of her father and brother). She has no problems with connections, tracking, and other performance issues. The mouse does seem to eat batteries at an annoying but not outrageous rate."
2,Terrible lag on both keyboard and mouse,"Although I like the compact design of the keyboard, its touch, and grab of the mouse, there is noticeable delay when I type very fast. This applies to the mouse as well, as I notice jerky movements especially when initiating a mouse movement. I tried connecting this to three different PCs and all of them had the same problem. I also tried calling the logitech support but over 10 minutes of waiting knocked off my patience.I don't know if this kind of lag is inherent in all the cordless desktop system, but I am certainly returning this product."
1,piss poor,If i would have recived the damn thing then yes but i never got the damn thing!!!!!!!!!!!!
2,Poor battery life,"I was happy when I received this product because I had gotten it for my parents for their Christmas present. Installation was pretty easy, just plugging it in started it up. BUT!!! When I called my mom to ask her how it was working, she told me that she had unplugged the key board because the battery life was horrible. She said at least every two months she had to change the batteries. I had gotten this because I thought it would be easy and convenient to use for someone less tech savvy. Now she won't even use it. I feel like I wasted my money. I guess I'll check when I go home to visit her, but unless I find out there was a mistake this review is staying like this."
1,unsatisfied,product did not work well at all...keyboard stopped working a couple of weeks after purchase.
3,Not a couch browser,"I got this to use with my PS3. The USB interface had no problems working with my PS3 under both the GameOS, and under Linux, however the wireless technology is somewhat lacking. It's rather finicky about having a completely unobstructed line of sight, and needs to be rather close to the receiving unit. The mouse suffers more from this than the keyboard which can make web browsing and fine mouse work quite the hassle.It is however comfortable to use, and light on the battery usage, so I can ALMOST overlook the connection issues."
4,"Ex-110 Not so bad, but","Installation was amusing.Instructions were: Turn off your pc, unplug the wired keyboard and mouse,Plug in the ex-11o receiver, and reboot. The next friendly message from the install cd is press enter to install.I got around the issue but hot unplugging and plugging.My only real beef is the buttons on the mouse come very low in front. If you desk has ""stuff"" on it, and you bump the bloody mouse of course you get a left or right mouse click, which in some cases is simply annoying and in other cases really &^%^$# annoying.I think I need to clean my desk. Its worth the amazon price"
3,Still lacking......but functional,"I am not thrilled, I have had several wireless keyboards and mice, hard to mix and match the keyboard with the mouse (trackball) I like, the keyboard is a little flimsy (I have had several keys get knocked off, and they don't go back on all the way).If you leave this in one place with one computer, then it is not bad"
2,"Invest more money, this keyboard/mouse not worth it","I bought this product maybe a year ago and haven't really used it much since then. It goes through A LOT of batteries, way more than the average person would ever want to place in a wireless keyboard and mouse. The keyboard and mouse never shut off so even when your computer is off you are still losing battery power. I brought this back out last week sometime and have been using it and taking the batteries out when I am done. In the middle of typing last night the keyboard completely stopped working. Tried everything to get it to work with no avail. The only way it does work is if I hold the keyboard so it is vertical and try to type like that. Definitely not worth it and I would invest in a better set."
2,"Worked fine at first, uses lots of batteries...","I'm on amazon right now to buy a new wireless mouse. This one uses a ton of batteries. I even started using rechargeables! Anyway, the right click button stopped working, so I can't even check my spelling in this review! I'm constantly having to reset the button on the bottom because the lazer gets ""stuck."" How annoying. I also have to open the battery case and reinsert the batteries up to 5 times per day. The more I write, the more I think about changing my star rating to a 1, but it did work great for about a year, except for the constant battery changes. The keyboard is fine. I like how it has an email key. That's about it!"
1,WARNING: Not all Logitech brand products live up to expected quality.,I purchased this product about two months ago. I noticed the lack of the traditional cap-lock and num-lock indicator LEDs right away. I also noticed the very short receiver range. The last straw came yesterday when the mouse died and I had to go back to my old one to continue working. If you need to go cordless I suggest going to a better quality product. It may cost more up front but will be more reliable than this one.
2,Mouse is cheesy,"I would not buy this. This was purchased by my office. On the keyboard I really like the location of the back button, the calculator, home page and e-mail buttons. The keyboard and mouse are loud. I can't express how much I hate the mouse it's really really noisy especially when scrolling and it eats batteries like you wouldn't believe and there is no warning that the battery is low. I would invest my money in a later model and get a rechargeable mouse, which will be cheaper than the money you will have to spend on batteries."
2,Limited range,"I have a computer linked to my tv, I wanted to have a wireless mouse and keyboard for it. The range is really bad, four feet and it has trouble working correctly."
2,You get what you pay for,"This is one of Logitech's cheapest wireless desktop items, and the quality shows it. The keyboard is functional, but the keys sometimes feel a bit squishy and less than responsive. The media keys are cheaply-made, and some of mine are already loose even though I've hardly used them. The mouse is by far the worst mouse I have ever used: it feels sluggish, is not particularly ergonomic, and worst of all, both buttons squeak with each click. I suspect this last part has to do with a badly designed battery holder, which seems to grind against the inside of the casing whenever the buttons are clicked.In terms of overall bang for your buck, it's not much buck, but even less bang. I'd suggest one of their higher-end products if you want to go with the wireless desktop."
3,Feedback,"This product is good enough for the money you pay. I think 'X' and 'Home' (Grey Color) buttons are placed in the wrong place (on the left side of keyboard). While holding the keyboard you may accidentally press the 'X' or 'Home' buttons which will stop your browsing or will take you to home page.Rest all is good with this product.Thanks,Rajesh"
5,Inexpensive option for your Wii!,"I picked this keyboard up for my Wii since it was the cheapest wireless option I could find. It works amazingly well. Less than 5 minutes after opening the box, I was typing a message to one of my Wii friends!One thing I would like to point out is this: The included mouse is PS/2 ONLY - not USB with a PS/2 adapter like the keyboard is. My laptop doesn't have a PS/2 port, so the mouse is pretty much useless to me. Also, the keyboard and mouse share a receiver, so you can't use them on two separate systems. This isn't really clear in the description above, so I thought I'd point it out.So in summary: if you're looking for a cheap wireless keyboard for your Wii (or a computer hooked up to your TV), this is a GREAT option. I'm not a fan of the mouse, but for the price the keyboard more than makes up for it.*Note: in order to use this keyboard with the Wii you must download the latest system updates. Visit nintendo.com for details*"
4,Does the job,Mouse and keyboard work very well. Wish the keyboard had a caps lock indicator light but other than that it has exceeded my expectations for such a low price. Got rid of cable clutter on my desl.
3,Made for elves with small hands,"I recently replaced a Microsoft cordless keyboard with this unit. So far, I'm not all that enthused about it. Mostly because of the compact keyboard layout. You would think that all keyboards are of a roughly similar size in terms of the size of the keys and how close or far apart they are laid out. Not so, when it comes to the EX110... My advice: try it before you buy it."
2,Unwieldy,Was disappointed with this. I found it hard to use and always nicking a large horizontal nip into the sides of my fingers. I think the plier like cuticle nippers are much better.
1,Does not do a good job.,I thought with so many good reviews this item would surely be a hit. I thought the people complaining were being nit picky. I definately should have listened to this one reviewer who said that this item does not leave a clean cut. I was left with jagged cuticle edges. I returned it the next business day. I'm not going to do my nails for it to look worse than when I started. I am not a professional and definately not an amateur in doing my nails. I do not recommend this item.
5,Great tool,"If youve ever had those pesky little bits of skin that pull up along fingernails and then get yanked off and sting youll love this thing - it cuts them close to the skin so they wont get pulled out by friction. All stainless steel, sharp edges, great buy."
4,Not as good as scissor type,"My scissor-style cuticle clippers broke after many years of use and I replaced them with these. While they work I may end up buying another pair of scissor-style clippers. I feel that these clippers lack precision so sometimes I have to spend more time making my nails look nice because the tweezer clippers haven't done their job. Perhaps I just need more time to adjust, but I won't buy them again.If you're looking for a pair that will fit nicely in your travel toiletries bag that you'll only use from time to time then I would recommend these. If you're looking for clippers you'll use more frequently then I'd look for another option."
2,:(,Wanted to order 4 of these. I am ordering for a all of our nail techs. Disappointed I was limited to 3.
2,Attractive but beware of TINY size!,"4"" diameter includes the handles. The actual diameter is more like 2.5"" and that makes this sugar bowl so tiny it could be used as a child's play tea set. Doesn't hold more than 6 teaspoons of sugar."
2,Bridge not designed for children's play,"Most children find this bridge frustrating as the top span is attached by two small pegs. Whenever the child tries to drive a train under the span, inevitably the child knocks the span from the peg. A number of parents took to glueing the top to the base as a final solution. We received two of these bridges as gifts. One was defective as the span did not fit securly on top causing it to fall off at the slightest touch. The second fits securely, but still not well enough to drive under the bridge without it falling."
5,Great affordable addition to expand your railway set,This was a great buy. My son loves this bridge. It made his Thomas set more interesting and it was affordable. The only problem with it was that it came in three pieces you snap together. The top piece kept coming off. We just simply glued it together. Now it's perfect.
3,a troubling but optimistic window into life,This is an excellent film that manages to self-critique important issues in modern France; especially its past and present treatment of illegal immigrants. Would you be brave enough to defy the father in this film?
5,Sheldon and Mrs. Levine,This book was hysterically funny and yet bittersweet. All my friends and myself have our own copies thanks to.
5,Hilariously funny,"A friend had this book on her coffee table. I read through it and we both laughed. It's so true of some parent child relationships, and hilariously funny at the same time. When I got home, I ordered two copies, one for myself and one for a gift. The book is put together with such detail, with letters you can remove from envelopes. It's a treasure."
3,Letters Galore,"Hi,my name is jessica Napier and my book is called Sheldon And Mrs.Livine.The authors are Sam Bobrick and Julie Stien.The genre of my book is realistic fiction,the setting of my book is New York,1993.My book has 43 pages.The plot is that there's this boy named Sheldon and he's mad at his mom because she payed his wife 50,000 dallars to leave him, and all they do in this book is write letters back and forth to each other.The reasonI like this book is because it's cool,funny and has wierd pictures in it.I would recomend this book to kids/teenagers 11 and up because it's funny to read and it;s got some pretty easy words in it to read.Agian I'm Jessica Napier and you can get this book from your local library.Bye!"
3,Book missing pages,"I've had this delightful book for ages, and purchased it again as a gift for my niece. Unfortunately, the book I bought that was advertised as Like New has missing pages. It also has a completely different ending than the one I've had for years, which I find disconcerting. The story itself is funny and smart, but the flaws resulted in me giving my niece my copy and keeping the defective one. Now I have to find one like the original to replace it. The book is definitely worth replacing, however, and I recommend it heartily. Just be sure you get one with all the pages/ letters that go in envelopes."
2,Unique artist,"At the time I purchased this CD, I did not know much about Brahms or Schumann. After listening to this CD of the Brahms and Schumann Violin concerto and comparing it with other big name violinists, you can see that the quality of this violinist is nowhere near the greats, such as Perlman or Gil Shaham.The Japanese violinist in this album is unique in that he is blind. I found that to be really unique and inspiring for a classical musician. However, there are parts in this album where he is a little out of tune and the runs are not completely clean. Having said that, I would avoid purchasing this album."
4,"Excellent faucet at good price, but no oak handles","After installing it this is a very nice and attractive faucet. You barely touch the handles to adjust the temperature. Good design; seems like a quality item. I have two gripes that caused me to rate it at 4 and not 5. First, it clearly advertises oak handles, but they were simply not in the box. I wanted porcelain, so it was OK with me, but poor marketing. Second, the installation instructions are poorly written, not clear or complete directions, hardly step by step. This was a problem when installing the sprayer. If you want only porcelain handles and know how to put the sprayer together in the right order without instructions, this is a great buy."
1,Wrong photo,"The photo for the product shown is the old product, which was fantastic. It appears that Glad has replaced all of the tall kitchen drawstring bags with the ""New & Greatly Unimproved"" version, ""stronger with less plastic"". The drawstrings shred the bags and don't hold squat."
1,Glad Bags Gone Bad,"I have bought the Glad Tall Kitchen bags (13 gal) for years. The past two packages have been completely unacceptable due to the drawstring popping out of the plastic. I thought the first package was an aberration; the second package has confirmed my decision to no longer use this Glad product. I would rate this product a ""0"" if I could."
5,YASMIN IS SOOOOOOOOO SEXY!!!,Thank you MGA! I think Yasmin is seriously soooo sexy and she is great. I love playing with her on her motorbike.
5,Simply Beautiful,"If you are an architectural students or professionals, you must get this book for your visual reference. Beautiful photographs of details and traditions of Japanese architecture... you will know why it's so influential to world and modern architecture."
4,the advantage behind every crisis,"Feather is a man of many employers. He has consulted for IBM, the UN, Northern Telecom, the World Bank, Shell Oil, plus assorted governments such the USA, Mexico and China. A suspicion could arise that in serving them all he shows himself ready to help anyone do anything for a consultant fee. On the other hand, perhaps due to his wide experience he knows what he's talking about. Feather has a vision of mutual success for the world. But before he can share his vision of 35 massive global opportunities concealed within dire crises, he feels he must rid the reader of certain presumptions: ""To those who cannot grasp the ongoing realities of global change, this book may strike them as unrealistically utopian. Some are always pessimistic, and it is indeed easy for them to marshall evidence to support their gloomy outlooks. I reject their doomsday attitude -- an essential prerequisite to proving it wrong""."
1,Not Extra Mammoth or even Mammoth and not fresh,"I received this bag of worse than ordinary pecans. They were advertised as ""Extra Mammoth"" and they are smaller than regular pecans in a grocery store. I have ordered ""Mammoth pecans"" from other vendors in the past. These were much smaller. They were also not fresh. Pecans store well if stored appropriately. These pecans obviously have not been. My wife is not even sure they are suitable for baking. Amazon should not be carrying this product if this is the size or the quality they can deliver. The only reason it got one star is because there was no lower option."
1,An unsatisfying interpretation of Salamone Rossi's music,"The most egregious problem with this disc is that the tempi are impossibly slow. In addition, the choir has a muddy sound which is not at all suited to the music of this period. If only one of the better early music ensembles would record Rossi's sacred music! Until then, there is at least one reasonable alternative: a set of two discs by the New York Baroque, which, while far from ideal, is a significant improvement over the present recording."
3,Not what I had hoped,"I was searching for a book that would help me answer questions about myself. This just includes a lot of coming out stories, but wasn't helpful. Most of the people in the book figure out they are gay or decide to stay with the same sex."
2,A gay book in bi clothing,"This book was disappointing in that many of the stories were about people who had essentially chosen a gay lifestyle, but merely stopped in the bi community along the way. I was quite disappointed."
5,Historical book still relevant today!,"This ground breaking book gave voice to a generation of previously unseen bisexuals. Rather than arguing statistics or debating the sexuality of long dead celebrities, Hutchins and Ka'ahumanu gave a space to normal bisexuals who told their lives.This created a new genre for books on Bisexuality. It is still as empowering and relevant todat as it was back then"
5,A Must-Read!,This book was invaluable to me when I first recognized that I am bisexual and not just appreciating the female form as a work of art. The essays were poignant. The writers helped me realize that I was not alone and that there were other people just like me out there. It helped take the sting out of being told that I wasn't really bi and that bi is just a stopover on the way to gaytown. Anyone who is Bi or knows someone who is Bi should read this book.
5,"Get it and read it, could change your life","I am BI, and so are we all at birth, but the prejudice will be overcome the day humanity evolves with their arses freed of their heads, a.k.a. NEVER. Well the information that you get can only be freeing you as a human being."
5,Perfect Representation,"This book is a wonderful example of the many, MANY different lifetsyles and experiences that bisexuals may choose to have. A wonderful representation, and a wonderful, interesting read. I highly recommend it."
5,Love sees no gender!,"For any of you who do not already self-identify as pansexual or bi, this ground-breaking, multicultural, pro-feminist, bisexual reader will make you re-examine your monosexuality. Through the use of personal narratives, the writers explore such issues as: the process of coming out, the bi community, self-affirmation,the politics of bisexual liberation and biphobia amongst heterosexuals, lesbians and gay men. For too long, biphobia and transphobia have fragmented the queer community. Just as white supremacy is used by the ruling-class to divide workers, transphobia and biphobia prevent us from being a truly powerful force against the patriarchy. In short, this wonderful book is a welcolme addition to Third Wave feminist discourse on sexual fluidity and radical queer activism."
1,LIVE???,"This is a live performance that has a bunch of his hits but is badly recorded and less than inspired. The live show is almost unlistenable.I think that the only saving value of this disc is one of the four studio recordings at the end of the c.d. That would be ""Kingston 14""; a dark, heavy track that exists on at least one other Isaacs c.d."
5,Interesting colors...,"First glance was not too sure of these colors, however, they are very attractive on and are not too shimmery which is good as I am older and shimmer is not my friend on my eyelids! My first try with NYX product and am pleased so far. I have dark brown eyes and this green is very complimentary. Would recommend"
4,Party Fun,"We just used these markers for my daughter's birthday party. 10 girls decorated t-shirts for a fashion show. The markers worked very well and the girls really enjoyed their creations. The colors are bright and the markers easy to use. I haven't washed the t-shirts yet, but expect they will hold up well."
4,Not For Dark Colors,"Nice colors and easy to use. But they did not show up at all on black canvas. At this price, I'll give them away, rather than returning them."
2,You get what you pay for...,"I purchased these to decorate t-shirts with a Girl Scout Troop. At the same time, I bought additional fabric markers at a craft store. While much more expensive, the craft store markers were far superior. The Alex markers didn't have the same intensity or saturation. They dried up long before the other markers. Although these were much more economical, you get what you pay for--a short shelf life."
4,this Book hits the Green 2ft from target,"i took a chance buying this ebook, but my the gamble was rewarded with quite an exposition on what Golf can do to a human being. It has been thoroughly entertaining, the purpose of most bedside readers. It also has brought together how & what a game can do to influence thought and action beyond the links.It just really underlines why i and so many love the game. A good read, though some of the english is 30's archaic; have to do a double-take on some of the phrases used and their meaning or writers intent. Adds to the spiciness though!"
2,"Disappointing, though I wanted to like it","I totally agree with the writer from Uzbekistan who says that Danticat's writing style is lyrical and lovely, but there is just too damn much suffering in this book, especially of the kind involving female genitalia! I can understand why she mentions the Haitian mothers ""testing"" their daughters' virginity, which has quite a horrifying impact on the reader -- but why does Danticat insist on harping on this over and over and over? Once was enough! And there is definitely too much chronological jumping around. One minute the narrator is in love and about to marry; then in the next chapter she and her baby daughter are running away from the husband. Huh?"
2,"Breath,eyes.memory","I read this book and I got a little confused about the people in the book because I really didn't know at first who the albino man was. At the end I realized who he was and he was the guy that sold lotto tickets to Sophies aunt. I would recommend this book to anyone because everyone is differnet in there own little way, so I think others would enjoy it better than i did."
2,Dysfunctional,"Breathe, Eyes, Memory, a story of a dysfunctional relationship between a Haitian mother and daughter, is not a well written book, therefore I do not recommend it as a must-read book. Breathe, Eyes, Memory lacks creativity in tying important and turning point events together. Although the story line is extremely captivating, the author does not elaborate well from point to point. This causes the mood or tone of the book to sway in every which diection, leaving the reader in a confussed state. Because of this dysfunctional set up, the book loses its credibility."
1,So?,"This book portraited an all too familiar childhood upbring for some of us as women. The bond with a close family member over your mother, the dysfunctional ""'shaking of the finger' to keep your dress down and your panties up"" warning towards our virginity and sexuality from mothers, aunts, and grandmothers, the painful memories of sexual assaults from relatives, neighbors, friends, strangers and people in authority, and dealing with death. There were too many gaps, sporadic jumping between story lines that the ending was a 'thud'."
4,"A Review of Edwidge Danticut's Breath, Eyes, Memory","I thought that the novel, Breath, Eyes, Memory, by Edwidge Danticat was a powerful and compelling novel. Edwidge Danticat captured readers with her emotional story of a young Haitian woman's struggles in life. Her writing style brought the story to life. I believe that it was her creative and mature writing style that helped the reader relate situations from Breath, Eyes, Memory to the situations in life that some of us experiences, and other hear about. Overall, I enjoyed reading Danticat's novel. My only complaints are about certain events in the in the book. From time to time I found myself confused about the events that occurred throughout the novel. It was hard an extremely confusing to follow the plots throughout the story, they seemed to jump around too much to get an accurate view of what was happening at times. I have no other complaints, and overall I enjoyed reading this novel, and would not hesitate to recommend it to others."
2,"Interesting, but sad and haunting","This is a haunting book about the relationship of a mother and her estranged daughter who moves from Haiti to New York to be with her at the age of twelve. Sophie soon discovers the reason her mother left her homeland and why she only wants to go back to be buried there. At eighteen, Sophie is emotionally scarred herself by her own mother's hand in a ritual called ""testing."" This accepted practice is reluctantly passed down from generation to generation, but it changes Sophie and her relationship with her mother. I thought the book was a tad too depressing."
2,Heavy Going Though Well Written,"This book is full of good, spare prose, but what a tale of woe! There must be a better way to illustrate female strength than through such a steady stream of pain and victimization. In fact, there is something kind of heavy handed about the story telling that causes this book to finally fall short in my opinion. Maybe I am just too old for this kind of thing. I remember reading lots of literature in this 'telling-the-story-of-female-oppression' genre as a baby feminist,' but I guess I have heard enough."
3,"Good start, fair finish","""Breath, Eyes, Memory"".....first part was very good. Second part not so good. The rest went downhill.I thought the story would focus more on Sophie's childhood. If that were the case, maybe I would have understood her and the relationship with her Mother better. Maybe I would have cared about the characters."
2,disappointing,"I agree with the synopsis of this book. The beginning is lyrical and magical, but as the book goes on, the characters are never fully developed. And while what happened to Sophie's mother was terrible, the writing just didn't seem to evoke my sympathy. As an aside, I live in Providence, and there was absolutely no evocation of that city at all. What made Joseph love it?For a book that will haunt the reader, I suggest Alice Walker's Possessing the Secret of Joy."
2,Very disappointing - Why did Oprah choose this one????,"This could have been a good book if it had been completed. It skipped all over the place, never fully developing the characters. I was interested in the Haitian culture and I was interested in the women, but it just did not flow. We jumped into the middle of the next step of their lives without knowing how we got there."
2,Disappointingly ordinary...,"(2.5 stars) Danticat is talented, without a doubt, but this book is a short story clumsily (and barely) stretched to novel length, chock full of archetypes and allegories but not nearly enough character development. In the end, you don't really know or care about anybody or anything; what should be an intense and emotionally harrowing story ends up flat and unfulfilling.It's a Lifetime TV movie-of-the-week. With an accent."
3,I could take it or leave it.,"This was not a great book, but it was worth reading it. I liked the cultural factors. It was interesting seeing the different ways people from another land live. I do not think that this is a book that I would read more than once but for one time it was worth it. As for what I would tell people that are interested in the book...I would tell them that it is intelligently written and that it was something that everyone should try to read at least once. I also warn there are things in the story that are going to leave a lasting impression on them. Which is what I believe gives the book merit."
2,What a disappointment!,"This was so shallow! I was expecting something of substance and it wasn't even funny! Read ""Middle Son"" to get a feel of life in another culture."
3,It had potential,"This book had the potential to be a good story, but some very important things were left out. I wish she had not skipped all the important years with her mother and her husband. I think some of the characters were not well developed. She seemed to hint to things that I feel deserved some explanation. Was her aunt gay? Was her husband just a freelance musician? Did she finish school or just quit? Her education was very important in the beginning, but then they seemed to have forgotten about it. Too many unanwered questions. I think Aunt Tante was one of the most interesting characters in the story. I wish the author had put some closure to that side story. Like I said the book had a lot of potential. I just think she didn't take advantage of the opportunity."
3,Hard to get involved in...but a good story,"The story itself had a good basis, but it was hard to get into. I enjoyed the book, because it was a book I could read in one night. I really didn't find any real story to it. It exposed you to Sophies relatioships with the women of her life..but could have shown more. I related to the bulima that Sophie suffred..but it was very sterotypical. My favorite part of the book was the ending. I finally was hooked on the last two pages..if the story had taken off for there it would have been good. I also disliked all the french in the book..i didn't know what half it was. THe book made a little more sense after seeing the Oprah book club dinner.It was a good book, wrote by a very smart young author. That will hopefully continue to write novels. I recommend the book, but don't expect too much."
3,This book was a disappointment to me.,I go into these Book choices of Oprah's expecting great things as I started with the Wally Lamb books which were. This book did not hold my interest--it plodded along and I was glad when I finished it. Oprah should submit some more good books as I am losing patience with most of them.
5,This is very interesting book that analyzes and gives life t,"I thought that this was a wonderful and easy to read story. It's basis was powerful and well- stated . As young Haitian woman I can defenetly relate to her experiences. The story in itself hits close to home , because her arrival to the states were very similar to mine.The bond she develops with her mother at the end was magical. A sort of link that Haitian women have with one another that is needed for support. Ms. Dandicat used alot of Haitian language(creole) which introduces a lot of the culture to its audience. It is a lways a gift and a benefit to learn about cultures. I defenetly would recommend this book to anyone that is looking to expand their horizon, and communicate in the language of another ethnic group."
4,I enjoyed learning the cultural differences,I enjoyed learning the cultural differences even though the story made me squirm in my seat. I find it hard to accept that so many women could continue such extreme female mutilation. I'm glad Oprah suggested it. I would never have picked it up otherwise. It was a good reading experience
4,Enjoyable Light Reading,I enjoyed the book but did not see the suffering and courage of Haitian women it is supposed to show us. It was a light tale of how traditions follow through generations. Even the ones which maybe should have been let go many years prior and how tragedies can take over our lives if we let them.
3,Enjoyable but needs more depth,I enjoyed the book but found that I didn't develop an attachment to the characters. They were interesting but didn't receive the depth of discussion they deserved.
4,Sweet and heartfelt,"This was a pretty good book, better than I expected, an easy read. The main character was likable and it was easy to feel for her. The story was sad and makes you think about the lives of women in Haiti and those who immigrate to America. Worth picking up and reading."
2,Kindle Edition is Bad,"The book is amazing in terms of Literature, but the Kindle Edition has typos, bad spelling and not a very friendly format."
4,"Heavy, somber prose.","Perhaps the best yet from Danticat but also the darkest. I appreciated the look inside rural Haitian maternal relationships and struggles. The undercurrent of mental illness provided for a dark and somber flow. Not sure if this was a reflection of common Haitian mental health issues or simply one family's experience. The physical transitions between New York and Haiti were interesting and informative. Certainly a book I will recommend. I would also recommend ""A Butterfly's Way"" by Danticat, for those wanting to explore other issues that challenge the Haitian diaspora."
3,"Brutal, beautiful... bittersweet...","What a startling book! 12-year-old Sophie leaves her dear Aunt Atie and her grandmother in a miserable, impoverished macout-run Haiti, at the bidding of her mother who has `made it' in the US (New York metro area). Her life in the US with her mother is not a bed of roses and as she learns more about her mother's terrible past and is, herself `damaged' by it, the book ripens into a powerful, heartbreaking tale. The young author has managed to portray the sociologically abused Haitian woman as survivors and her tale of love and loss and the bonding of these generations of women is overwhelming. Largely a matter of her background, the author also does a splendid job of transmitting, through her words, the feel, tastes, smells, and even the fear of both her Haitian and her American settings. A tragic, beautiful book - another testament to the resilience of humankind."
3,Not exactly what I was expecting...,"Then again I don't know what I was expecting; maybe a happing ending, or a joyful book. The book touched on some heavy topics and gave a lot of insight on the Haitian culture and also was a bit depressing. Well thought out and clearly written from the heart: over all good read."
5,A Moving story,"Breath, Eyes, Memory is one of the books written about the Caribbean that I really enjoyed. Like Edwidge Danticat's other novels and stories this story is well written in a lyrical evocative style. What I cherish about the story is the fact that I came to have a better understanding of Haiti, their culture which is close to that of Benin in Africa and their rich though mysterious belief. Much of the pains, fears, horrors and complications of Haitian history are unveiled in this amazing story which can make you cry, sigh, laugh, angry and happy in different turns. The usurper and Other stories, The Kalahari Typing School for Men, Disciples of Fortune,turned out to be some of the good stories I read. This true to life story is a recommended read."
3,Readable,"I'd heard about this book and finally borrowed it from a friend as a bit of variety from my usual reading style. It was hard to know what exactly to think of it. I would have to agree with many of the other reviewers who said that the characters seemed less developed than they could have been; it would have been nice to go more in-depth. However, I did appreciate the relationships between the four main women in the family. I felt that the author did a good job of showing how it is possible to be angry at someone, wounded and betrayed by them, but still love them and be close to them in some ways. I have to wish that the ending had been more developed, but it had some good points as well. All in all, I'd call this book average (but would be interested in knowing more about what Haitian writing tends to be like, because I know little about the culture, and understanding it better might make me appreciate this book more)."
4,I remembered that I liked to read,"I picked this book up while working a grueling twelve hour graveyard shift, and I was pleasantly surprised by it. I have read books in the Oprah book club before, but I was really pleased with this one. It was short, poignant and well written. It helped me remember how much I really enjoy reading."
5,Can you feel it?,The intense feelings in this book are crazy. I didn't know whether to cry or roll into a ball. I don't think any book has touched me with its beautiful writing.
1,Not worth it,"This book was clearly written by a 14 year-old girl. The characters, mother-and-daughter relationship, and story were underdeveloped. Find another book to read."
4,An opening to an always ignored culture,"I found this book to be my personal path to a culture that I have continously avoided. Never before had I thought of becoming familiar with the Hatian people or there culture. The book kept me in suspense and was rather tear jerking due to personal experiences I had with my mother. The mother daughter relation ship was truly realistic, and I am more understading of cultural adversities and how why we are so different,yet, we are so alike, ""doing the best we can with what we know.""I believed at the end that Sophie would break the cycle. Just as many of us wish we could get rid of those old folklaws that are no longer accepted, needed, or wanted today."
4,fascinating,"This was a great book to read, it took me back to some of the practices of my native country. we have certainly come a long way. I admire women, specially the women of Haiti, who are as strong as a guayacan tree."
4,Culture lesson in an intriguing tale,"How many Americans really know what happens in Haiti? Why do the people come here by boat risking their lives? This book tells how life in Haiti is for common poor people, and reveals also the cultural weight placed on women by tradition and superstition. Women in this story leave and come to New York, but their pasts are always inside them. It's a good story about a young woman's troubled relationship with her desperate, but loving mother and how it affects her life."
2,A credible first attempt,"It was an interesting portrayal of Haitians as something other than wretchedly poor or occult preoccupied. This was, however, unlikely to have been Ms. Danticat's intent. Her agenda appears to be that of a liberal woman of the Ivy league, rather than storyteller. It might be remembered that some fathers care for children and balloons do not typically rise."
2,I'm over Oprah's Book Club!,"While I related to the characters and learned something about the Haitian culture, I found the book rambling and rather elementary in scope. I was happy to read that it was one of the author's earlier attempts. There are shades of promise here. I have been so scalded by some of the other Oprah books that I think this one finally convinced me that I make better choices on my own. While I have overcome significant challenges in my own life, it seems to me that most of her books have a similar theme.....poor people, who can only escape their existance within their minds and suffer, suffer, suffer so eloquently in the process. I was so tired of this story by the time it was over!! Previously, I had to start ""She's Come Undone"" three times. Toni Morrison's books are beautiful, though tedious, because she tries to use the entire dictionary in her syntax. I'll make my own choices.. I found Amistead Maupin, Diana Gabaldon and Barbara Taylor Bradford on my own!"
2,I'm disappointed,"I enjoyed the initial part of the book. During the rest, I kept hoping for it to become less predictable, for the characters to turn out more real."
2,Just Barely An O.K. Read,An o.k read. This was certainly one of those books that didn't live up to my expectations. I guess if you're a woman -- a Hatian woman more specifically -- you are more likely to connect with this book. I don't think the author did an adequate job of writing this story to reach a broader audience. The least favorite of Oprah's book recommendations.
2,Very disappointed,"I agree with many of the other readers that this book had the potential to be very good. However, the characters and the story could have been and should have beeen much better developed. I, too was surprised that it was chosen by the Oprah book club."
1,WHY BOTHER???,"After all the publicity this author and this book, as well as ""Krick! Krack?"" received, I would never have anticipated such an ordinary an insignificant work. The declarative writing style does not engage the reader in the least and eventually makes you feel like you are reading a newspaper account. The characters could have been likable and reachable from the reader standpoint, if at least developed to the point where they are not just capricious women with a lot of vague and trite points of view on life....that the author is trying to turn into sageness. And I wont even go into the male characters!!! I hope Edwidge grows up and refines her style as well as her subject matter..."
5,Amazing - moving,"I am in the midst of reading all of Danticat's work, and this is by far my favorite (so far). I can't remember the last time I cried so hard from a book - it is incredibly moving."
4,A good book that portrays life in another culture.,I picked up this book at a second-hand book store. The book sounded as if it would give me an insight into life in Haiti. I applaud Danticat for this amazing book.
3,A very light read,"While I felt that the plot was pretty decent, the characters were not fully developed. We never learned the true motivations for Tante Atie. Nor did we get a true look into the Mother's nightmares. I think character development is a problem because we are looking at the story from the main character's point of view. However, I believe that Arthur Golden did a much better job with ""Memoirs of a Geisha"". With ""Memoirs"" Golden's character showed tremendous insight, while with ""Breath, Eyes, Memory"" we are just getting a very distant view of the characters."
4,A trip to another time and place,"This is the first book I have read by Edwidge Danticat. Breath, Eyes, Memory was an enjoyable, attention getting story. Once I started reading I couldn't put it down. When the story ended I wanted more, I wasn't ready for the ending. My eyes and mind were glued to the pages. The experience opened my eyes and my heart. What a journey! This is one of those must read. The story opens with a small girl and the next thing she is all grown up. The journey she takes is one that will affect the rest of her life and possibly her childs. She learns that life can be very cruel and rough, but she takes what she has and moves on. But she will never forget the past."
2,Did not emotionally move me....,"I bought this book because it was Oprah's book club pick...I could not put the book down because I hoped that there was more, but instead, it was very predicable and not very interesting or moving....I have not read any other novels by this author and do not care to."
5,Easy to grab.,I read this book in 11 grade and I had to do a report on this book. The report was easy to do because the book was easy to read and easy to pick up. I am glad that I got a chance to read this book. When I see it in the book store I will be proud to say that I read that book.
3,I really wanted to like this book...,but it fell short of what it could have been. The story didn't flow and felt disconnected. Dandicat continuously built up what seemed to be a emotional revelation and then let it fall short so many times that when the emotional pay off came I didn't care anymore. I did like the novel up to the main character moved to New York and then the story began to fall apart.
5,Brilliant,"I read this book and shed tears at its poetic brilliance and naked candor. To focus on the awful subject of ``testing'' is to completely miss the point of the book. Dandicat tells us that life is hard, life is tragic, but it is also joyous. Breath, Eyes, Memory is like a fountain of cool water on a parched soul. Drink!"
5,"A touching, and wonderful novel","I am a Haitian woman, I lived there until I was 18, and I am shocked by some of the silly responses this book has received from other customers. As one of the more level headed customers noted - when we read Arundati Roy's book do we conclude that all Indian children commit incest? Of course not. This is a beautifully written, thoughtfully and carefully observed novel that engaged me throughout. I read it, judged it, and enjoyed it, as a work of fiction. Most sensible readers will no doubt do the same. It's a beauty, as is Krik Krak and I for one, can't wait to read Danticat's next book."
3,Very good book!,"Edwidge Danticat has written a very interesting story. The relationships between grandmother, mother, and daughter are well developed. I would recommend this book to anymore that likes to read about women and family relationships."
5,Unforgettable,"A captivating story of mothers and daughters as experienced through theeyes of a young Haitian girl. Bittersweet memories and savage realitiesthread through this unforgettable tale placed in both the author's nativeHaiti and in New York City.- Barbara, multiculturalism"
5,I Read This Book Some Years Ago...,"and while I dont remember every point of the story, I DO remember the emotion that I was flooded with in every chapter. Especially towards the end. This was a very good book and very well worth reading."
4,A breath of fresh air,"Told in a straightforward and vivid manner, Breath, Eyes, Memory tells the story of Sophie as she leaves Haiti and her aunt, the only home and mother she's known. Summoned to New York by her mother, Sophie must learn how to get along in this foreign land with a woman she barely remembers.Through her own experiences, Sophie learns to appreciate the bonds of strength and nightmare that she shares with generations of Haitian women, choosing what to keep and pass on to her own daughter, and what to abandon. A quick read, but one that will change my perceptions of motherhood and sisterhood forever."
5,Never a dull moment with Jack Frost!,"I 'met' Detective Inspector Jack Frost through the British TV programs which came from the books. While David Jason's portrayal of Frost is slightly more pleasant than the original, he's pretty true to form. I really enjoyed all of Wingfield's Frost books (there are 4). This one was slightly annoying with an overuse of Frost's crudity, but not enough to do more than make you groan in sympathy with those around him. The book is fast paced. You won't want to put it down, although you may not be able to finish the 357 pages in one read. If you want an interesting, well-written police procedural that'll keep you thinking and guessing who the villains (there are several cases in progress) are you won't be disappointed. Even though Jack Frost is frumpy and crude, you can't help liking him."
4,Relentless and compassionate,"Frost is a new series character for me and I will enjoy following him in this series. He is brash, rude, profane, obscene, callous, rough-edged, filthy minded and has poor personal hygiene. Nonetheless, he is also relentless and compassionate. He gets his bad guy and also shares the credit.Most of the police have the flu and -- of course that's when a whole series of crimes take place, piling up on the exhausted Jack Frost. (Would someone's parents really do that to a child?) meanwhile, his vicious and incompetent superior is looking over his shoulder trying to find an excuse to scrape the Frost out of the force."
4,A cool way to type!,"This keyboard skin is a great object to help you type. You'll be memerizing the keys in no time! This is great, especially if you use any typing program on the computer, because it's a waste of time without this item . With this, you will know the keyboard inside out, and it's really easy to put on. Just slip it on and you're ready to type!"
5,Fireplace tools,I bought this item for my son's new home and it is beautiful. He really likes it. It is much better in person than on the picture. I definately will buy from them again.
2,"Good material, awful fidelity","It's nice to hear Carole King's earliest demos, but they sound horrible here. Really horrible. And there are only four of them. The rest are later, solo-era Carole. Ms. King does not have much of a voice, but she is superbly musical, and I'd love to hear more of the same, only in acceptable fidelity. Meanwhile, don't waste your money on this cheap offering."
4,about XRCD's...,"Being a Reiner ""fan"", I've listened to versions of Beethoven's symphonies in ""standard"" RCA CD's, ""Living stereo"" and JVC's ""XRCD"" series. I can assure (by instant comparison turning the selector control of the amp)that in several cases -when a Living Stereo is a contender for instance- that there's no difference AT ALL in sound!! ...so the price of the XRCD will be far higher and (totally unacceptable) a good deal of XRCD's include 50% of the music of the original issue!!!Another example of this, is Bartok's ""Concerto for orchestra"": exactly the same sound quality, twice the price and less than half the music!!But let's not forget the main point: maybe not THE last word on Beethoven's 7th, but far enough quality to have/keep it...as anything Mr.Reiner conducted."
4,RJ11 4C Surface Mount Telephone Jack,Price was right for the simple telephone jack. I used it to integrate my skype server in my home telephone line.
4,"Fun Game, But...",This was fun however for the person who takes the role of the banker and has to give an offer to the player is a bit challenging (for those math-challenged).
3,deal or no deal dilima,"This game will definitly excite Deal or no deal fans. Yet, there is too much work that has to be done. You have to first put all the cards into the ""cases"". Then, for the bank offer, it tells how the real banker actually calculates the offer, but it is too dificult, even with a calculater, so there is no real way to do it. then, after the game , if you don't want to put the cases in order the next time you play, you must do it at the end of the game. It is fun, though, if you really play it. So, if you want to pay less, but do more work, get the game. If you just want to play it peacfully, get the tv plug in version or the handheld (not the dvd version its slow). It is your choice: Deal, or no deal?"
4,If you like the show you will love the game,My 9 year old daughter loves to watch Deal or No Deal on TV. This game is a great way to spend time together instead of just sitting and watching something on TV. Lots of fun.
3,It is what it is.,"This is a cheesy gross-out flick. It is an exploitation movie, so, by definition, it is exploitative. It is that mixture of corny and sleazy that should have you wincing and laughing, if you like this kind of stuff. You know who you are - the people that like to roll around in the muck - the people who respond to sick, irreverent humor. If you are one of these people, then you should see the movie. It is probably the best gross-out exploitation movie ever. I only gave it three stars because I am only mildly interested in watching one degradation after another. It's imaginative for the genre, but it still gets old after a while. Watch it once and then come back and watch it ten years later. Don't buy it unless gross-out movies are your main thing. It's readily available at your local non-Blockbuster video store."
3,Mehhh......,"I'm not actually sure how I feel about this movie, having watched it twice. The whole premise of the movie (and main attraction) is the fact that it's a master and his little black midgit servant torturing women. They chop women's heads off. They throw darts at women's rears. They kick women. They just torture and torture and torture naked women. And that's the entire story, give or take.However, it's hard not to be entertained by this, wondering what kind of torture they will use next. Sardu is pretty funny, as is Ralphus. And I really liked the music. In the end, it's a pretty cool movie that you likely won't watch many times except to show to friends. Not too bad."
3,'She must dance for me!' ha ha ha!,"Maybe the best Exploitation flick outthere! Planty of surprises and very weird! It's not a so bad it's good...it's a so not bad it's good! It will never win any awards but it's damn funny and somethimes hilarous. I hate troma but I like this one very much. If you like Salo 120 days, Caligula or any exploitation movie, you may like this one."
4,Jaw-Dropping Eye-Popping Cult Classic,"A few years ago, my Dad was visiting and I rented ""Bloodsucking Freaks"" because it looked fun to goof on. But it hadn't been running long when we both fell silent and just stared in dumbfounded fascination. This film is SO perverse that we couldn't believe it was available on an open shelf to rent. The combination of skin (lots of it, and pretty good, too), violence and sheer depravity make it unlike anything else I've seen. The scene with the dwarf, the babe, and the guillotine is a classic. And don't even get me started on that special ""Black & Decker"" moment. A disgusting gem."
3,OFF THE EDGE,"This movie has to be the most extreme Troma movie I have seen so far. It is full of Violence,Cannibalism,And Torture. The movie is very sexist,But if you get past that it is rather enjoyable.And if your into good gore effects The Brain-Sucking through a straw will get your attention. If you are a Troma fan ""Buy It""."
5,Classic Horror at it's best !,"If you liked Scary Movie, Blair Witch, or I saw what you did last summer; you are just NOT READY for this movie! Hide and cower in fear.New horror just can't compare to this 1970's gore, S&M;, bondage, torture film. Blood Sucking Freaks gets better every time you watch it. However, I wouldn't recomend it to anyone under 17."
3,Three Stars for Fascination,"How do you rate a film like this? By any standard it's a horrible film. It's disgusting, and it stoops to ridiculous lows. The acting is horrid, the plot does not exist. But still, it manages to fascinate.With each frame, one wonders: ""Why was this film made?"" and ""Why am I watching it?"" Well, Bloosucking Freaks is like no film you've ever seen. And that is what keeps you watching. It stoops to lows that you didn't think possible, and somehow this compels you to keep watching."
1,The Worst Movie Ever... not to be considered.. Trust me!!!,"Now.. I am a big fan of Horror movies. The more gore the better. However in this movie there is nothing whatsoever to relate to or even to analyze. It is simply a stream of various women being tortured. If you enjoy gore and you want to enjoy what you are watching stay away from this one and buy a movie from Peter Jackson, Dario Argento, George Romero or Stuart Gordon."
2,big fan of troma but this movie blows,first thing to all troma fan you can get there movies rite now for 5 bucks till halloween now about this movie its so slow and boring the actors are so monotoned its not even funny and the blood isint even close to the real thing they acually use red paint and im sad to say i own this film and if you do buy hide it if you are ever investegated by the police i think you can be arrested for owning this dvd in aleast 23- 27 differebt states
1,The worst movie I have ever seen,"This is definitively a very bad movie. No plot, bad actors, horrible video transfer. It is a sequence of sadic acts against women, while two sadics laugh all the time. This movie is not an horror movie, it is simply a series of disgusting scenes. If you like horror (I do) there are so many good movies and directors like Romero or D'argento, but not this one."
3,"Misogynist, Despicable....I've seen it 4 Times","I caught this at a drive-in at age 14 or so. Like a cheap wine with the bottle cap left open, it has aged horribly. Plot is inexcusably flimsy excuse for sadistic hate carried out by putird MC of torture show and his midget sidekick Ralphus who is even uglier than his name. Amatuer brain surgery on live victims, necrophelia with severed heads, yes its all here. A self indulgent and cruel film, watchable only for it's amazingly light treatment and detachment from the true levels of depravity on screen."
3,Worst DVD transfer ever?,"I can't believe Loyd Kaufman himself would call this ""a digitally-mastered version"". Luckily the horrible video quality doesn't really distract from all the good ol' fashioned bloodsucking going on. This movie also has one of the best soundtracks ever, in that it fits the low-budget nature of the movie. I'm glad I have a surround sound theatre to fully enjoy the pre-1970's synethesizer music. Well anyways at least the DVD is packed with extras, I especially liked the tour of Troma. Oh I almost forgot to mention that Ralphus is the best midget ever to appear in a minor motion picture! As for the reviewer who said anyone who enjoys this was a nazi, they should be put in the cage with the crazy naked women."
3,Strange little movie,"This movie is not one of the best Troma films I've seen, but it's OK. The story is about a freakshow that uses all kinds of sadic acts on women. The film is discusting but some how I sort of liked it. The scene where a woman gets her brains sucked out through a straw is a classic."
1,How Many Films Offer You A Brain Milkshake?,"No good actingNo good storylineNo good effectsNo good anything here, just someone's idea of a bad joke that accidently found it's way into public circulation.If you've ever wished a negative to be destroyed for a film, this would be the one.The one star is for the cover art on the box, it looked promising.Blood Sucking is right, at your expense."
1,5 Stars if your intent is to be grossed out completely,"Bloodsucking Freaks is the only movie I've ever seen that I HAD to turn off. It was that disgusting. Yes it has cheesy ""Hershcel Gordon Lewis"" style blood and guts, but the situations the tortured girls are put in are so horribly degrading that its just too painful to watch. I wonder about the mind of the person who made Bloodsucking Freaks."
1,PU!,"I enjoy bad films as much as the next guy, but please! this is too much to stomach. BAd in every respect. Once again, a waste of a DVD! Why is n't Star Wars out instead of this bottom-of-the-barrell dreck!!!Not even fun to make fun of, depressing!!!!!!!!!"
1,Not even worth watching to laugh at,"I love bad movies, but this was just stupid. Don't waste your time. The girls aren't even worth it. Trust me."
1,Sick and twisted,Do not even bother watching this junk. Full of violence and vulgarity beyond your wildest imagination. This movie should be banned!!
1,this film sucks,"like most of you, i was taken in by the title and poster for this movie. it gave me the sense that this was going to be a sick, sick movie. plus its released by troma. with people saying that its more controversial now than it was in the 70's, how could it not be good?! i found a used copy in my home town and felt thrilled. i put it in that night hoping to see some of the most grusome acts ever displayed on film. but no, i got an hour of a midgit making stupid remarks, and an old man thats into S&M...for himself, and not anyone else. the acting is beyond horrible, the effects and ""gore"" are waayyyyyy sub-par, and the only interesting character, the doctor, has 5 min of screen time and then is killed by the midgit. and i know what youre saying, ""but paul, i love bad horror movies, theyre funny!"" not this one, its so bad youll wonder why you watched it. DO NOT BUY THIS MOVIE OR EVEN ATTEMPT TO WATCH IT!!!!"
1,"It can get worse, and it does.","I watched this movie late last New Years Eve at a B-movie party. Noone there had seen or heard anything about it. As we watched, we kept saying ""It can't possibly get worse than this."" And it did... over and over. Everyone involved loves horror/sci-fi b-movies. All of us were apalled. I give it one star only because I can't give it less. I walked away from this film feeling like less of a human being for having seen it."
1,"A new low, I am so ashamed...","I am glad to say I only rented this movie. It was a tossup to decide which movie was worse, Blood Sucking Freaks, or Dark Backward. Maybe the fact that I am putting the two in the same category is enough. If you are into hardcore cult movies, and you have seen every other movie that you would ever want to see, RENT this movie. If you have nothing else better to do with your money than buy a movie like this, please, help someone out and give to the needy instead."
5,masterpiece,i love this great horror film no one brings flims out like troma i just wish the ladies in this film shaved like the girls these days any way one of my fav dvds ever
2,Impossible to Judge,"Unfortunately, Bloodsucking Freaks is virtually impossible to review as Troma's DVD transfer of the film is practically unwatchable. It appears as if it was taken from a ninth generation VHS copy. The colors are washed out, the picture is murky and if it were not for the unreleated extra features,(the troma tour), it would be a complete waste of money.The film itself has its share of moments both darkly comedic and horrific but cannot rise above the horrendously poor transfer."
3,Mondo disgusto,"""Bloodsucking Freaks"", formerly known as ""The Incredible Torture Show"" is a truly depraved movie that will sicken even the hardiest splatter fan. The effects are amatuerish, the acting horrendous and the plot virtually nonexistent, but there's no charm of the H.G. Lewis variety here. But if you've just got to see it, well...don't watch it with anyone who might be offended. Because there's plenty to offend in this puppy!"
4,"Over the top,gory and a riot of a film","when I whatched this movie and it totally blew me away, I have always been a fan of B-movies and for anyone who is a fan of B-movies this is definatly your cup of tea. Full of nudity, gruesome violence, some of the cheesiest(and most memromable) acting I've ever seen. this is the perfect movie to smoke up too or get drunk and whatch with your chums. so enjoy you sick weirdos:)"
2,what the he** is wrong with you people?,"Sick?Disturbing? This ridiculous Troma tome has been blown WAY out of proportion by the critics and viewers who've condemned it to high Hades. The head-drilling/brain-sucking scene was great,but the rest of the FX were fake as he** and the acting made me laugh."
4,Roni Sarig: Seriously?,"First of all, I want to express a frustration that I have. If you write official reviews for and are employed by amazon.com, you should probably put at least some effort into your review. There is no song called ""Never Lonely Again"" on this album. There is, however, a song called ""Never Lonely Alone."" Is it that hard to look at the tracklist while you're writing, especially if you're being paid for your writing? The title of the song repeats over and over in the song, and it has a much different meaning than the incorrect title that Sarig pulls out of nowhere, which leads me to believe that Sarig didn't really even listen to the album all that carefully.I think this is a great, underrated album, and I hope more people give it a chance."
2,Allways the same,"Prog-rock? Pfffff!! (...) It's a mixture between NSYNC and U2, but with less originality, could you imagine? I give 2 stars to this record just because sometimes remind me of early Marillion. But then I fall asleep and dream with Transatlantic, that's neo-prog!!!"
4,Listen without prejudice,"I know prog-rock has a reputation of being old-fashioned and boring. Long songs with endless solos, the kind of music only musicians listen to etc. Some of that is true for this record: the songs are long. But never boring, never (too) complicated, the solos are never endless and I enjoy listening to Pendragon even though I don't play any instrument. I hardly know how to whistle... These songs are songs with stories. They deal with a variety of subjects, that I won't elaborate on now, but every time you listen to this record you notice something else. People with a sincere disgust for Pink Floyd and Marillion should avoid this record. Everyone else should at least give this album a listen or two. Give Pendragon the benefit of the doubt, and before you know it, you recognize something. That something is different for everyone. Find out what it is for you."
4,"Vibrant, washable colors",This markers are a great fine point started set for older toddlers and preschoolers. The assortment of colors is great and they color well. Many of the most frequently used markers in our first set ran out of ink after about a year so they don't last forever. They aren't too expensive for little kids who still press a bit too hard sometimes.
5,The best blending tool!,"This is one of the BEST kitchen tools! I use it for stirring muffins, scones, brownies, pancakes,and blending sauces or sautéing, etc. It's great because unlike a whisk, it will mix heavier doughs or sauces without them sticking in between. And, it doesn't scratch my nonstick pans and cleans out the pan or bowl like a spatula. It cleans up like a dream in the dishwasher and doesn't get discolored with curry or tomato sauce. I hope it becomes available again so I can purchase some for my friends and family!"
1,Professors please don't ........Please,Please listen to the words of an undergrad. I have had a strong background in Calculus I and when i was assigned this book for my Cal I class.....I became confused. This is the worst book ever. Every one who has taken Cal I at Tulane also agrees.
1,"Please, Prof... DON'T DO IT!","If you're a professor out there trying to see if this book is any good... please, don't buy it. It's horrible. It's practically in Greek and I don't think Plato could've understood it. My class is going quite well and I understand the material. I just wanted to review the text for the final because it's departmental. I feel stupider for having opened it! I used a friend's text instead. Please... look elsewhere!(Sorry to any student who've already had to buy it.)"
1,BAD!!!!,"This book is simply the worst textbook I've ever seen. To put things into perspective, Calculus is much harder for me than Organic Chemistry, simply because of how awful the textbook is!!!!"
1,Horrible,"I've already taken Calculus I and I used Stewart's calculus, and I transferred to another college and am currently taking Calculus II, and had to buy this horrible book. Upon reviewing old material in this book and comparing it to Stewart's, I think the explanations are totally unclear, almost to the point where I have to read it with a freaking dictionary next to me. Addison Wesley should have stuck to elementary math!!!"
5,Dinosaurs are great!,This has fast become my son's favorite book! He asks for it all the time and is also learning good manners too!
3,Cute but not a favorite,"We have all the how do dinosaurs... books and while I thought this one was cute, it was never a favorite for my daughter, now 4. I believe I got them when she was 2 1/2 and I think I only read this one a handful of times, unlike the other ones which I still read weekly."
5,Great Book For Dinosaur Lovers.,"My son loves these books. He laughs and giggles the whole way through. The fact that she puts all the names of the dinosaurs hidden in the pictures for the parents to see is great. It gives me an answer for the inevitable ""what kind is that one, mom?"""
4,Great book!,"I was worried these board books wouldn't be as good as the large hard cover Dinosaur books, but they are just as charming. The illustrations are great. They are about half as long though. My 3 1/2 yr old loves all the Yolen dinosaur books."
3,Cover is upside down! Content of material cute,"The content of book is very cute; good for a young child interested in dinosaurs,and for mothers interested in teaching their kids how to keep their rooms neat!However, book was assembled with cover upside down!Quality control - a bit lacking!Haven't returned it yet- I may use it to teach my gradkids aboutassembling, or just to just watch them figure it out!"
4,Fun Storybook,I have bought nearly all the books in this series. I am a teacher and a mom and BOTH my kids and my students love the stories. This one is very cute. A good buy and nice present if you're browsing!!
5,I Love It!,"Apple Dumplin is so sweet! Any stawberry shortcake fans out there will love this adorable doll! She is sweet and cuddly, and even talks! A great gift for young children!!"
5,Another Talker in the house....,"This is a great doll for any young girl. It even came with batteries already installed.... Small enough to be carried easily, but still big enough to seem life-like. Voice is very clear, and the whole doll seems very well made....It says about 50 different words or phrases according to the info sheet. I still can't figure out how to make the ""listen"" feature on it work. Maybe she'll tell me someday...."
3,Huffs & Puffs,"Although Amazon's description says this unit is ""designed for boats up to 4000 lbs"", mine just manages to handle my boat which weighs about 1200 lbs. Wiring was a nightmare (I had an electrician do it for me) and, surprisingly, was designed for a use with a car rather than with a truck, so so truck owners will need to buy a plug.The heavy nylon strap is a plus, but lack of a remote and emergency handle for manual operation are definite minuses. If I could do it again I'd save my pennies and buy a more powerful unit with remote control."
3,"CHI-TOWN , RAP-A-LOT !!!",I ONLY GIVE THIS ALBUM 3 STARS BECAUSE THERE IS NOT MANY TRACKS ON THIS ALBUM.THE BEATS ARE HARD HITTIGN THOUGH.AS YOU SHOULD KNOW THIS RAP GROUP AS SIGNED WITH RAP-A-LOT RECORDS.THIS IS A RAP GROUP THAT IS HUNGRY AND WANTS TO MAKE IT TO THE TOP.CHICAGO RAPPERS ARE COMING UP IN THE GAME AND ARE BEING MORE SPOKEN OF AROUND THE COUNTRY.THERE IS OVER 6 CHICAGO RAP GROUPS AND MORE THAN 4 SOLO ARTIST AND MORE IS TO COME.
3,So it is right for its size and it meets its objectives...,"The review is prominently positive. However, some observations are made about what the dictionary could have been or could have included, but did not. Then the same observations backpedal and the reviewer says that those things that ""could have"" were not part of the dictionary scope or objectives. Then again, if it is right for its size and it meets its objectives, what is the use of pointing out what was not supposed to be? This review sounds like ""well, yes, I like it, but I must point out something negative, even if it does not make much sense...to make it sound like a review..."""
4,Good film to use with native speakers,"The plot isn't as action-packed as ""Llorona"" nor as familiar. It's an interesting story, but difficult for intermediate learners to watch."
5,A learning read,"Being from Alabama, this was a must read on history of the moonshiner and also how it related to the racing industry"
5,Breathtaking,"This sounds like it was tossed off in one late-night recording session, but it sounds phenomenal. If this album contained only Put It On The Glass (I will write into my will that this song plays at my funeral), it would still be the perfect album, but along with Eyes To The World, Dreams, Beers In Heaven and Before I Lose My Style it is just outstanding."
5,helpfull and creative,there is a lot of information on how to use lights and input on creative ways for solving problems in a studio. the only thing i would wish for is cheaper more minimalistic ways of coming to great results
2,This book is good neither for beginners nor professionals,"The good point about this book is that it has many images and shows exactly how the lighting is set up. But images are horrible. So you can never learn why a particular type of lighing is good or bad. In other words, you never understand the reason behind a particular type of lighting becuase the result is so bad.More importantly, this book doesn't teach you an approach towards the lighting. So at best you should just memorize and copy exactly its images with its lighting set ups. This is neither for beginners nor professionals. I wouldn't recommend this book to anybody"
2,Terribly out of date,"Published in 2002, but full of images that would appear to be from the 1980s, this is horribly out of date. Thus, no mention of digital and the dramatic changes it has bought to studio photography and images that have dated terribly. Even as a 'technique' book this has limited value as many of the compositions are so bizarre and unusual that you are hardly ever likely to need the kind of lighting that is presented. If you are looking for a book with general advice for product and still life (which I was), this is not the one."
2,Disappointed,This is an oldfashioned book with elementary sketches showing lighting setups and not much else. I would recommend instead:Light: Science and Magic: An Introduction to Photographic LightingThis book explores an approach to lighting that excites the imaginiation.
1,"Horrible, didn't even finish it","This book had great potential, but utterly failed. It was incredibly too long, and that's just judging from the 70 or so pages that I did make it through. The plot was confusing (was there a plot?) and there was absolutely no excitement whatsoever. When you think of three girls renting a house together for the summer in a popular area, you think crazy parties, sexy men, etc. This book had nothing. In fact, the plot kept switching from their homes to the summer house. Did they only stay during weekends? Couldn't figure that out and didn't even care to try. Glad I got it from the library and didn't waste money on it! I'd say skip this one."
3,Quick Beach Read..........,"I had a long weekend to spend on the beach and I finished the book in a few sittings. It wasn't really quick moving but gave you enough to get through it. I thought the author could have condensed it a little more because it really picked up more towards the middle. But I did get through it and I liked the last three quarters of the book very much. So if you can get through the first half, press on!"
1,disgraceful!,"Holly Chamberlaine (author) needs to get another job. She is a very poor author. This book was horrible. Everything about it. The story line, the characters.....especially, Gincy, and the length. It was SO unecesarily long. How many times was she going to try to cash in on the joke about NH. Everytime Gincy referred to her hometown, it was always something like, Armpit, NH. Rodent infested, NH. I mean come on, it was somewhat funny once (NOT) but how many times are you going to try to repeat the same supposed joke? GET A LIFE. Readers, don't waste your precious reading time. I cannot believe this book got published and I wasted $13 on it. Which is the only reason I totured myself to finish it."
1,Very Disappointed,"I was very disappointed by this novel. I was looking for a light beach read, but this was way beyond that. The writing was flat and contrived (I can't imagine anyone would ever talk that way in real life!), none of the characters were realistic or even likeable, the book flopped back and forth between different characters and locations without ever following through on anything, and each chapter ended in a silly almost sitcom-like ""moral."" I was also really put-off by the childish gag about one of the character's hometown (she kept referring to it as things like ""barfville"" that nobody above the age of 12 would ever use). I felt upset and cheated the entire time I read the book; like someone had stolen my money and time. I actually stopped reading about 50 or so pages in because it was just too bad to continue. I leafed through the rest of the book to find out what happened and see if anything improved, but it didn't."
3,Light read,"Enjoyble. Not a Pulitzer Prize winner.But for chick lit it wasn't the worst.It did go a bit longer than it needed to. Predictable ending.Considering how long it took the author to get the story out,tying up the ends came very abruptly.The author had 1 ethnic slur which I took offense too...""Mario the Euro trash"" Don't understand why the insult had to be made. The character could have been described differently without insulting an entire group of Italians and Sicilians with stereotypes!"
3,So-so bicycle cover,"I bought this bicycle cover to use at college. The quality of the material is pretty good (thick,not thin and dosen't feel like it will fall apart) and there are two straps on the bottom, at the front and the back. However, it does not cover the bicycle completely. I have an Adult Mountain Bike. For example, I can get the front covered completely to the ground, but then the bottom half of the back wheel will be revealed. And there should be a strap in the middle, to prevent the middle going up when its windy (and raining)."
3,bicycle cover,I like the quality of the Nashbar bicycle cover I purchased however it does not completely cover my bikes. I would prefer a more oversize cover.
3,Nashbar Bicycle Cover,"Good cover for a good price (which has since increased). My husband has a ten speed bicycle which was taking up to much room in the storage shed, and kept getting knocked over as I was taking the smaller bicycles in and out for our children. My husband is 6 ft. 3 in. tall so the seat is high. The cover does not cover the back or front wheel completely, but I was most concerned about covering the frame and seat which it does. All in all a good cover for the price (which at the time I purchased the cover in July 09 was less than $15.00."
2,Late Arrival,Unfortunately it is difficult to write a review because I still have not received as of this date.
2,not impressed,Book was very slow and un interesting. I didnt feel that it had anything really gripping to keep me interested. Never finished
2,Too wordy,The book was too predictable. I felt descriptions went on for too long and I wished the relationships between characters would have been developed more.
3,Samsung monitor,"This monitor is just OK, nothing more and nothing less. It just isn't bright enough and there does not seem to be anyway to manually change it. Unfortunately, the 15"" CRT it replaced was much brighter and easier to use."
4,"Great band, regular dvd!!","Zeromancer is a great band, they mix heavy metal & eletronic and make great music. But the double dvd brings only 7 live songs, 2 videos and a 2 tour documentaries, one in USA and other in Europe. The sound & images are good and the band have a great performance. I hope, in near future, that band come with other dvd, with more songs, a better production and some bonus features. However, like a first work, with the dificulties from the music showbusiness, it turns a good step for this european band, that bring us some great stuff. It worst the money."
4,Suspense and humor with a wicked twist of an ending,"Still mentally fragile and recovering from the betrayals Sam Casey suffered in WHEN THE DEAD SPEAK, the police sergeant must now face suspension, possible homicide charges, and a rocky personal relationship with fellow detective Jake Mitchell. This is either the worst or the best time for Casey to become distracted by a murder on a casino boat that involves a strip bar owner, CIA agents, a reverend, and a hitman. Tooley fills this mystery with lively characters, witty dialogue, and a pace that speeds up in the last half of the novel as Casey recovers some of her confidence and develops an unhealthy relationship with beanie babies. Native American culture and myths are also introduced as Casey uses the gifts from her heritage to see clues while foster mother deals with their reservation's desire for a casino. Romance, suspense, and mysticism all rolled up the lastest Sam Casey novel by Sandra Tooley."
5,Great stuff!!,"This book is the 2nd in the Sam Casey series. I loved her 1st book and it sets the stage nicely for this story. You get to like the characters and believe it or not even the villain gets you in the end. A page turner with a twist. Great entertainment and a little gore. Can't wait to order the 3rd book. At $2.99 - very reasonable, for sure. I do not think we ""Kindle Kuties"" should pay over $9.99. Publishers better wise up. I used to be a Patterson and a Stuart Woods fan...now I won't buy their books at their ridiculous prices. Good for you S. D. Tooley!!! A new fan of Sam's!"
1,Predictable.,it seems as if the author received a contract and needed to see how fast she could get these stories out. they are predictable and quite drab.
2,"2 Thumbs Down,Way Down!!!!!!!!!!!","Good afternoon I really don't partically care for this doll and it has no Educational value except how to dress hoochy,We are at a critical age and you need to feed our minds I think her outfit is really unappropiate and she needs to cover up-Megan-"
1,myscene rocks,the dolls dress like strippers i mean what kind of baby dolls(i mean baby bratz dolls)haves a mini skirt and a breast shirt it looks bad myscene dolls never copied bratz bratz copied diva starz and you know it so STOP HATIN SO MUCH YA LOSERS HA HA HA!!
5,Don't be fooled by the picture,This Sasha is so pretty... in pictures. Her clothes are cute but I don't care for her too much. She can be fun to play with. The green and pink eye shadow shouldn't have been done.
1,Fatty ugly,ew these brat dolls are the UGLYIEST things ever!!!! they have big heads and big feet and they look like hoochie mammas! they are all ugly!!! and they do not have a passion for fashion! give me a break! they have no fashion sense wat so ever! Barbie is way hotter than these sorry losers.
5,My First One,"Yes ladies, this is the first Bratz I could not resist. When the world is as crazy as it is;war, racism, sexism, debt, or datelessness...I find it totally therapeutic to escape with this fun little doll. With this funky lady the world of the rich and fabulous is mine!! This Sasha is causal and chic, perfect for a first date or picnic in the park. Her outfit is complete from head to toe...(with earings and bangles might I add.)I knew when I bought this doll that it would not be the last. I find that this line (Bratz Dolls) is so detailed and well designed that I can proudly display each piece and see something new and entertaining everyday."
3,Good..but...,The make-up above her eyes is too green! It doesn't look good on Sasha. Thats why i'm gonna get Tokyo a-go-go Sasha for Christmas. She is so much cooler.
4,I have already written a review but I have to say something,"Hey listen people. [...] I already wrote the review called it's great but have you read the review LUV IT BY IT,? Well please do if you have not. It says someting about her,Sasha (a doll) getting nasty with the boys and her lookinng sexy! Come on. [...]"
5,Funkalicious!,"Ok, so I'm not a kid or anything but I think that these dolls are the best! They are the only ones that I've ever seen who wear clothes that are anywhere close to the clothes that real teens wear. This glam-diva doll is no exception. Her hair is adorable, her green and pink make-up is stylish and almost gives me a few ideas, and I totally want her camo capris/white tank top outfit! (Not to mention a pair of those killer green boots!) People who are down on these dolls have obviously never taken a good look at them."
4,30 Days - 1,Great book. Liked it so much I bought some to give away to some seniors as part of a graduation gift.
3,Nice but a bit simplistic.,"I enjoyed breezing through this book, but it's really targeted to people with no prior experience with the Bible whatsoever. There are better books out there. I recommend Idiot's Guide to the Bible, which has more depth."
4,broadway kids,"My kids love this CD, and it's not as annoying for adults to listen to in the car as a lot of music for kids."
4,The Broadway Melody-For Kids!,"I first saw this CD on a commercial...you know..1-800 commercials. Anyway, my mom got it for me at Tower Records. I started to love every minute of it. It was awesome! Now I have deeply researched a couple of those kids, and they have been in hits like The Lion King, Les Miserables, Beauty and Beast, and more. No wonder they have good voices!"
3,"Pleasant, but not a memorable album.","I imagine any music teacher would be ecstatic to have all of these talented kids in one class. I doubt if there is any regular school that could assemble this number of skilled and gifted youngsters for a performance. Bottom line, though: these kids are still kids; and they can't deliver the nuance and impact of older performers. While I wish these young people well, I didn't hear enough great moments on this production to make me want to go out and buy more of their CD's."
2,Not the most useful source,"Following Ho Chi Min is not as much about the story of a colonel following Ho Chi Minh, rather, it is more about the stagnant political situation that followed after the death of Ho Chi Minh. The take-away from the review from Indochina Chronology,""Here is a wealth of gossip level detail about life on the inside at the top in Hanoi"", is very accurate. It is a wealth of gossip. While containing interesting insights and revelations that sometimes seem difficult to believe, Tin's narrative suffers from a rambling style that strives to introduce as many topics and leaders as possible in a minimum amount of time and space.There are better sources available, and while it does contain useful insights, Following Ho Chi Minh is really of most use to the serious student who has already exhausted a more extensive list of other sources on the topic. For those interested in learning about Vietnam, I would recommend reading ""The Sacred Willow"" first."
5,A Very good children's book with nice illistrations,a nice storyline with interesting and pretty pictures. A treat for children of all ages including 18 and above.
2,Boring,"I'm really surprised that this book has gotten nothing but 5 star reviews. I'm a big fan of good literature (my favorite children's book is ""Rikki Tikki Tavi"" by Rudyard Kipling) and I was excited to receive this book based on all the glowing reviews. That excitement was short-lived when I finally read the book to my 6 year old son. It's not an awful book, but I didn't find it nearly as endearing as the other reviewers. It's a fairly short book, and all it's about is how the kids in town use their imagination in this place called Roxaboxen. They pretend they're riding horses or put in jail for speeding, etc etc. I wasn't a fan of the story or even the artwork. My son's opinion? He said, ""Mom, this story is lame"". This book will be going in the Goodwill pile."
5,Anyone who loves imaginary places should read this book.,This book should be read by every one young and old. I though it was wonderful. I have been longing to own it but it is fun reading it at the library in a big comfy chair. I suggest that everyone reads it.I am 12 years old and still Love it.
4,Great book for all audiences!,"This book was absolutely fantastic. I read it to my 5 and 2 year old children, and they each sat through the entire story. In fact, once it was over they grabbed it from me to look at the pictures.There was one thing I didn't like about the book, and it's only because it provokes a lot of questions from my 5 year old(has to do with the lizard). So, if your child has a tendency to ask lots of questions, you can skip that page. Otherwise, this is an excellent choice, and I'll read it again."
5,Wonderful,I have loved this book since I was a little girl and I cannot wait to use it in my classroom! It really sparks children's imaginations!
1,Very nice book for adults.,"Lovely, haunting, poetic book -- for adults.But, for a child, nostalgia for ""the way we all used to play outdoors in an abandoned lot, decades ago"" doesn't make a very interesting topic. Certainly there have been no repeat requests for this book at story hour. And mine is not a child who shuns the haunting, the subtle, the poetic."
5,Excellent!,"This story captured my 4 year old's imagination and sparked a creation of our own Roxaboxen in our unfinished basement. I would have to say, in my 7 years of being a parent, I don't believe I have more enjoyed the subtly of a picture book than this one. Do yourself a favor and treat yourself to a book that you will enjoy as much as your child."

2,basic guide to commercial springs,"depending on what your looking for you may not want this guide. it has a fairly well established list to many commercial hot springs, but little else. If your looking for hot springs where you can hook up your RV then this guide may work for you. If on the other hand your looking for real, natural hot springs off the beaten path, then this guide is worthless."
1,Horribly Outdated Information,"This book does a great public disservice. The information in the book has not been updated in years and is terribly outdated. Quite a bit of the information is absolutely wrong. Send the publisher a message - don't buy the book until they update it. Save your money, there are much better, current books out there such as ""Hot Springs and Hot Pools of the Southwest"" & Northwest - which are updated ever two years"
1,Good in it's time,This book has outlived it's usefulness. Much of the information contained in it is inaccurate and outdated.I'd reccomend another book such as:Hot Springs and Hot Pools of the Southwest: Jayson Loam's Original Guide (Hot Springs & Hot Pools of the Southwest: Jayson Loam's)
2,Just what we need. RVs at wilderness hot springs,"The only useful thing about this writer's books on hot springs are the USGS maps and the latitude/longitudes. I bought a book of his nearly 20 years ago and was thoroughly dissatisfied, & was incensed when it seemed to me he was more interested in providing info for the land yacht crowd. I wonder if his book alleging that the lunar landings were hoaxes is any better. I doubt it. He probably denies the Holocaust took place, too. If you want a book on hot springs, check out Jayson Loam's books. They are much better. If you want info on faked lunar landings, get the movie ""Capricorn One."""
5,Wow,I was hooked after the first sentence and couldn't put it down until the last sentence. Unbeliveable suspense. Thanks to W. G. Griffiths I am now a chain smoker. What's next?
2,Shadad this book,"For those of you that didn't get it, the Shadad that Krogan keeps yelling is the Hebrew word meaning ""to devestate or to destroy"". So, how come a Christian minister can expell the devil? I think that parts of the story actually show that a Christian minister and the devil are on the same side. Just my considered opinion, if Amazon.com still allows me to have one!"
4,Very Original and Compelling villian,"I have become less and less interested in reading fiction as of late because of it's perdictability and bland characters, but I must admit that Driven was a truly refreshing read. The primary characters Gavin Pierce and ""Krogan"" were original and certainly unpredictable. The supernatural undertones of the book were creative as well, and the dialogue throughout was very convicing. All in all, this was a fast-paced thriller with great suspense and it continually kept me guessing as to what would happen next."
2,childish,"Moderately compelling plot line drowned in boring characters weakly drawn and juvenile writing. Actually, for young teens it's probably a moderately satisfying read. Only managed to finish it for lack of something else handy to read. The second book (takedown) is surprisingly even more shallow and comes off as nothing more than a harlequin romance with a slightly better plot line. So bad I just couldn't finish it, which is a rare thing for me. Got both books because they sounded interesting and had strong reviews. Simply shocked by the celebrity reviews; what, did these people even read this book or were they just bought off? If you are interested in supernatural detective cross-over novels, give F. Paul Wilson's Repairman Jack series a try, they won't insult your intelligence and are a heck of a lot more fun to read."
5,When I must laugh or else I will cry...,"This is a wonderful book, especially for reading aloud. The headlines and other excerpts are works of deathless prose or unintended double-entendres which were *actually printed* by newspapers around the country. Watch for your home town newspaper -- perhaps someone you know thought up the headline ""Milk Drinkers Turn to Powder."" Well worth the investment."
3,"funny, but short & expensive","This is indeed a cute book. It would be a good asset for an English teacher to show what happens when modifiers are left dangling and punctuation is missing and so forth. But it seems expensive for what you get. The book is physically small (8"" by 4"") and a little over 100 pages. I'd estimate it has about 200+ bloopers. We all flipped through it, had a good laugh, and were done with it on the day we got it. There are websites with as many bloopers (English teachers on a budget - look there first). This book does have the advantage that some of the bloopers are accompanied by pictures."
3,A decent introduction........,"I picked this book at the Monterrey Bay Aquarium in the summer of 1995, during my first visit to the california coast, and just before I did a couple of days of scuba diving in the local waters. This book is small, almost pocket-sized, certainly easy to transport and provides illustrations of the most conspicuous fishes (e.g surf perches, kelp bass, rockfishes) but I saw many other fishes not covered in this guide and decided to get a Peterson guide when I went diving in San Diego/ La Jolla the following year."
5,An Irresponsible Nobleman That Has Gone Over The Top!,"This is basically a survival story. A Russian Nobleman on a hunting expedition shoots a Blackfoot Indian youth for sport. From that point on it becomes a story of very desperate survival. This book is a ""Very"" good read."
5,Addams Family still funny after 30+years,"One of the best/funniest sitcoms still. Without refrences to pop culture the jokes have remained fresh, and deliciously dark. I wish I had waited to buy the entire series, instead of one at a time."
5,Amazing,Absolutely amazing always love them and now they are back and still as good as they once were! Tha addams family at there finest!
1,addams family volume 3 dissatisfied,i thought this would be the entire 3rd season and it was not...not happy. I believe the description of this product was insinuating that it was.
5,Is it really 6 discs?,"The box set for the entire series (should have been done this way from the start) contains 9 discs, 3 per volume. It doesn't make sense that volume 3 is 6 discs. Can someone verify? Thanks.http://www.amazon.com/Addams-Family-Complete/dp/B000V3JGIS/ref=sr_1_6/103-7483250-3441440?ie=UTF8&s;=dvd&qid;=1190558031&sr;=1-6"
2,Buyer Beware: Disc Damaged,"The Addams Family is a great show, but MGM/Fox Home Video has really dropped the ball here. I received this from Amazon as a gift but have been unable to watch it due to damage to the discs. Volumes 1 and 2 of the series were released in slimline cases, but this set includes 3 double-sided discs in a single case. Unfortunately, a security device is enclosed in the package (and for some reason facing the discs) resulting in serious damage (multiple scratches) to the first disc. I requested a replacement from Amazon, but that copy was also damaged as before."
5,Great CD,"This album is definitely different than anything I've ever heard. I'm a huge metalhead & love all things heavy. This CD is actually kind of mellow, with heavier parts. When it comes to the more mellow music, it takes a lot to really get me, most of it just gets really boring. This is a very good one, sort of psycedelic actually. A great one to get stoned to. It has some hints of heavier metal that really adds a lot to it also. One of my favorite things about it is that it's only 1 song, a song that lasts an hour. That's something you don't see too often. If you can get into the more melodic Opeth stuff you'll like this CD for sure."
3,Too long.,"Why? This CD is simply too long. Light of Day... starts off brilliantly, it soon becomes apparent that after the first 20 minutes or so that there is not much to offer. Maybe the song should have ended at 17 minutes. They could have taken a few other catchy riffs and written some good tracks. After one sitting it is unlikely that I will ever listen to this CD straight through again. Let's leave the epic catagory for the likes of Pink Floyd, Yes or King Crimson.Light of Day is my first Green Carnation CD. I can see that they do possess musical talent, just not for 60 minute tracks. I look forward to hearing another work by them."
2,Dissapointing,Highly repititious not nearly enough changes in tempo if broken down to standard song length (time) >few good riffs and vocals are weak. Headed for the do not play pile. As for the 5 star reveiws ... you folks gotta look around there's a lot coming out of Sweden that blows this cd away.
4,Pinnacle if Orgrisses,"I first heard of Green Carnation while driving to a concert a few towns away. The person I was driving with, owned this album. I'll admit that an hour is a long time for a song, but this Tchort wrote it so fluidly that it never gets boring. Buy this album."
2,Required Reading,"This book is typical required reading for a race class, but the book was not very well written. That said, it was probably second best out of the four that I was required to purchase."
4,Essential For The Classic Film Buff,"The most complete source for films from the thirties, forties and fifties. Especially strong reviews of European and Asian films make this absolutely essential for those interested in film history, now that many more of these films are available on DVD and on Turner Classic Movies. Ebert and Kael remain my favorites for films of the sixties onward, but you won't find a better collection of information about classic films anywhere else. Highly recommended."
3,Quality Control Needed,"Lord of Forever had some new and interesting twists on the whole immortal angle. However, I was disappointed and often disconcerted by the shabby editing. Whether a book is priced at $2.99 or $20.99, a buyer deserves decent editing. This storyline was completely sidelined several times by entire paragraphs being misplaced or repeated. It's pretty hard to stay involved with the characters and story line when poor grammar, punctuation, and paragraph flow force you to reread over and over for understanding. With just rudimentary editing, I would have enjoyed this book a lot more. Too bad the author allowed her book to be derailed like this. It just makes her and her publisher look second rate."
2,very small for the money,"I cant believe this toy is $45!!!!! its very tiny... such a small addition to the tracks.... My son got his with a bigger set that came in the Thomas toy box (Thomas and Friends LC99544F - Roundhouse Train Set with Thomas Storage Toy Box)... even then, that was $400 but i cant believe just this small item is so expensive... it does make a nice addition if you already have a lot of other bridges and tracks... but in itself its not a very big deal"
3,Price Watch,"You can buy the entire figure eight set that includes this piece for less money. The toy itself may be fine, but these sellers are price gouging. Check the figure eight set with the water tower and see if it's cheaper."
1,useless book,"I looked through it and looked through the reviews on on amazon. Don't waste your time with this book. Cook claims you can earn 300 percent annual returns. Think about that for second... Start with $10k in 15 years, you'll over take Bill Gates. Just look up Wade Cook on fool.com if you want to learn the truth.And about the other reviews on this website... it's painfully obvious that most of them are fake."
2,re-titled book,although the book is OK. Its just a re-titled book Wade wrote in 1985 called Real Wealth.Why bother with an old book you might already have.
3,SO TRUE! UK HAS BETTER STUFF,"I completeley agree with the person who wrote about the DVD complete series collection! US should have it too, I want ALL EPISODES of seasons 1 through 8, and in a future, the last season. I believe also that UK has better service and so much more variety, and I believe US is a bigger Friends fan."
4,The friends show my dad likes,"Wow, that's alot! I say that i really like the show friends because it has a lot of humor and the charecters act so dumb, and it's funny because they aren't really that person, it's just the actresses and actors doing there line.Ialways wanted to be an actress to. it's awesome!"
3,It's Silly To Buy This Instead of The Complete Seasons!,"Friends, it's an awesome show but I think it's silly to buy the best of DVD collections when you can buy the complete seasons on DVD and get all of the episodes and not someone elses idea of what the best episodes are!"
3,"""Rock, Hard Place, ME!!","i have trouble ratin this dvd...some of the episodes on this dvd, i all ready have one the Complete first Season...hence..the name of this review"
5,We do have each drama 'till Season 3,"During living 4 years in the US, I did not care Friends. And now, I am in Japan and am big fan of Friends!!!We do have every episode untill Season 3 for Region 2 so far. We are going to have Season 4 until the end of this year. It is toooooo slow to show up on the market though.. I watch Friends every day!!"
5,Friends at its best!,"This is definataly a sampling of the best Friends has to offer! You get: Volume 1: ""Pilot"" ""The One With Two Parts (Parts One and 2)"" ""The One with All the Poker"" ""The One Where Ross Finds Out"" ""The One with the Prom Video"" Volume 2: ""The One Where No One's Ready"" ""The One with the Embryos"" ""The One with Ross's Wedding (Parts 1 and 2)"" ""The One with All the Thanksgivings"" ""The One Where Everybody Finds Out"" Volume 3: ""The One with the Blackout"" ""The One with the Candy Hearts"" ""The One Where Ross and Rachel... You Know"" ""The One with the Football"" ""The One That Could Have Been (Parts 1 and 2)"" Volume 4: ""The One with Chandler in a Box"" ""The One-Hundredth"" ""The One with All the Resolutions"" ""The One Where Ross Got High"" ""The One with the Proposal (Parts 1 and 2)"" These are all the best episodes in their uncut form plus a behind the scenes look at Friends in 3 featurettes. A definite must buy for a Friends fan!"
3,DVDs Are Better Then Video Tapes!,"Friends is an awesome, great show but why buy the best of episodes on video tape when you can buy them on DVD or better yet why not buy the complete seasons on DVD instead of best of episodes? Hey I know some people still like their video tapes but with DVDs you don't have to worry about tapes wearing out and thinning out and snapping in the VCR, etc, and on the DVD discs it's much easier to find where your favorite episodes are without having to rewind or fast forward to find them, you just go in the disc menu and click on the episode you want to watch or click on the play all feature. And they say taht video tapes are going to be obsolete soon!"
1,Where is the acting?,"The cast of ""Friends"" has to be the worst group of bad actors in sitcom history. (And this is bad, since sitcom actors in general are among the lowest grade of acting) Terrible. The lowest of the low. And what is nearly as sad is the writing for this lame show. I think people who enjoy viewing ""Friends"" are generally pretty naive. But then, most of the American public is naive...and that's obviously who this type of show is targeted at; the dense majority."
3,mediocre,"The doll fulfills the roll of being Strawberry, but the purple dress material balls up quickly, as well as the material the doll is made of. Not going to last long. The eyes are also a little odd... almost creepy. It took my 2 yr old a while to warm up to her, but it is well-loved now. Wish I would have spent more money on something higher quality, since I'll have to just replace this one anyway soon."
2,This book is for believers.....,"This book is written to answer ""'The Da Vinci Code"". After reading both books it appears that Amy Welborn has based her arguments on the same beliefs that were chanlleged by Dan Brown. This book may help those who are in desperate need to get some support for their challenged beliefs, but it does not convince an inquistive mind searching for answers."
1,Dogmatic Christian Rebuttal,"Amy Welborn rebuts Dan Brown's novel -- as if a novel needs rebutting -- by comparing it to the bible. Where Brown diverges from the bible, Welborn concludes Brown is wrong.Why? Because the bible is the word of god and infallible.If this level of intellectual discussion sounds attractive to you, be my guest. It was a little too moronic for me."
2,Far less than I expected.,"There are a lot of good points in this book, unfortunately, the author does not remain very objective and takes every chance that she can to slam Dan Brown. She even gets so petty as to scold Brown for calling a document a ""script"" when it is in fact a ""codice"". Thanks for the info, Amy. Now I can sleep tonight.I think I would have more respect for this book if it didn't seem like such a personal attack against Brown, but instead laid out the facts and counter-arguments in a non-biased and objective way."
2,Probably not what you're looking for...,"If you're looking for an objective view of how to 'de-code' the Da Vinci Code, this is not the book for you. This is obvious from the author's own adamant verbiage, such as 'This is simply not true' and the fact that she does not always provide historical data to support her argument. Welborn tends to focus on tedious and irrelevant parts of the book. Teabing tells Sophie that the Bible was not 'faxed down from heaven' and according to Welborn's brilliant revelation, this is 'not news to us.' Well... duh. Thanks for clearing that one up. Robert Langdon is a professor of Religious Symbology, which Welborn chooses to remind us doesn't exist at Harvard. Why is Welborn picking apart character development now? Dan Brown is clearly pushing for an Indiana Jones-type character, which works just fine. I blame myself for purchasing this book, since I failed to research the author."
2,So much anger!,"Just when she makes an interesting point, a paragraph later her logic devolves into a slippery slope tirade.Example- p23""Brown's characters frequently assert that the traditional Christian understanding of Jesus' life and ministry is false. Which would mean, then, that the New Testament, the source of that understanding, is completly untrustworthy source of information.""Am I the only one that sees the massive holes in that assertion? Just because SOME of the New Testament may have been doctored doesn't mean therfore that it is COMPLETLY ""untrustworthy"".Clearly she set out writing this book with a mission in mind. After all, this was by a woman who wrote a series of Sunday school books for teenagers entitled ""Prove It"".Given that, its hard to give this book much credence."
3,Pretty good book,"Amy Welborn does a fine job of dealing with the issues raised in the Da Vinci Code, but I must say, I found it less thorough than another book on the subject, ""Fact and Fiction in The Da Vinci Code"" (0971812861).Welborn, for instance, doesn't spend much time on the way anti-Semitic strains in 19th century German philosophy and theology influences a lot of the ""theology"" in Dan Brown's book. She also doesn't spend as much time on the modern origins of Wicca as one might hope. Kellmeyer's argument from Scripture debunking the assertions about marriage between Mary Magdelene and Jesus are very compelling; Welborn's arguments are good, but she misses the points he makes.Overall, the two books overlap on some points, but they complement each other well. If you buy this book, you'll need ""Fact and Fiction in the Da Vinci Code"" to finish fleshing out the answers."
1,Don't look for facts here.,"This book reads like the churches answer to The Da Vinci Code. Much like The Da Vinci Code is filled with assumptions of history, so is this, without the preface of 'fiction'. If your looking to delve further into 'true' history of Da Vinci, don't buy this book. I've always been one to treasure literature, but this book I literally tossed into the garbage after reading the first 50 pages."
5,"If you love Da Vinci Code, then you love CRIMES OF THE RIGHT","If you love Da Vinci Code, then you love CRIMES OF THE RIGHT by author HOPE NEWMAN. Just like Welborn, HOPE NEWMAN has never come up with a more head-spinning, spine-jolting, intricately mystifying thriller. The action jolts from a secret government complex in the Colorado Mountains to the seats of power in the Whitehouse. Every chapter ends with a cliff-hanger; the story brims with assassination, torture, cover-up, sudden surprise, and intrigue. It's a sure-fire bestseller."
1,This book is not a clear and critical review of the Da Vinci Code,"The author is biased about all the speculations offered in the book. She conviently discusses what she thinks is the ""correct"" and ""right"" facts according to the Bible, but she does not go on a lot of historical facts and details that are essential to understand the speculation caused by the DVC. I think she should have done her homework in a better and more thorough way. She lacks a lot of historical background that is needed to understand the scriptures. It was very disappointing. I don't recommend this book unless you are a fanatic that don't want to hear anything beyond the holy scriptures."
1,total dribble as well as boring,"What is it with all these authors who are trying desperately to make money off an admittedly fictional book. Just because they didn't think of it first, doesn't give them the right to critize someone else's work of fiction. Does a piece of fiction have to have ALL their facts correct with no tolerance for creativity and literary license? According to Amy Welborn, the answer is no as she tags her name to the best selling book ""The Da Vinci Code"" by Brown in an effort to make some money off the fame of the book herself. She needs to grow up and write her own book that she creates from her own mind rather than stealing from other peoples works to make her own living."
1,I also want my two hours back,The book is written in a very condescending manner which I found to be insulting at best. Amy Welborn does not appear to understand that Dan Brown's novel was fictional.I struggled to finish this trite novel and I now wish I had spent my time more wisely.
1,Please,"Hi,Yeah, both views are interessant but people seems to take Dan Burstein's book too seriously. That's a novel not a bible... I have a problem with over-religious people who take religion too seriously... Please, read the bible, not novels and leave people be !"
1,Narrow Thinking,"This book is a perfect example of narrow-mindedness; she might as well say ""this is the conventional wisdom, so ask no questions, explore no further."" And I am so tired of seeing her phrase ""serious scholars"" - is it not true that great thoughts and inventions have always been the products of unconventional minds? The Da Vinci Code IS a novel, and perhaps people have gotten carried away with the whole thing; but not only has it made the author and publisher richer, it has enriched those who have read it by sparking curiosity and controversy."
4,Comprehensive Look At Gay Families,"This was a good, somewhat disjointed look at lesbian and gay families in the United States today. This is perhaps the only book dealing with the history of the movement, but much of it seemed impersonal. I am not sure if Benkov's target audience is lesbian and gay parents and their supporters, or if the book is supposed to be a way to convince those opposed to the movement. All in all though, it was an enjoyable and informative book, and it is a must read for anyone interested in this subject"
4,Great face,"Sort of semi-ethnic face sculpt with fair/olive skin = very interesting combination. Her lipstick isn't the awful pink or even the cherry-red. It's a beige-ish color that people actually wear. Her gown, which can be removed (with difficulty) is gorgeous and looks stunning on dark-skinned dolls.I redressed her in a modern Greek costume, and she looks perfect. Her hairstyle is the basically the same as Danish Princess, but thicker and longer and not so ratty-looking.One the minus side, she has those ridiculous Princess feet and generic white flat shoes."
3,I love culture,I love to read the educational literature on the back of the Princess of the world Barbie boxes. I think it would be great if Moms bought these to educate their daughters. It's great to expose them to different cultures and different expressions of beauty.
4,Leather Contest Guide,"This book was very helpful for our purposes, and I would recommend it to anyone wanting to learn more about the Leather Contest world. It is a very easy read, and the author is very easy to relate to."
1,Sad to kill trees for this,All materials here are fine and well but the most important thing to ask is why do these things? Do they prove anything? Why wasn't the question asked and answered in the book about these events serving to promote a sense of DRAG in the gay leather/fetish/bdsm community? The question is always asked but no one answers them. A fair research and a fair update is probably in order -- otherwise this book is useful to line a kitty litter box or a birdcage and nothing more.
5,Great,Bought this for my father who is a vietnam vet. He really LOVES it and watches it all the time.
2,Failure of CD tp play,Purchsed CD twice - one received as a gift and it did not play at all. Identical situation with CD I purchased. Complete failure of CD with no sound at all. Attempted playing in several CD players and CD failed to play in any player.Very disappointing even though money was quickly refunded in the one purchased. Was not able to receive refund as it was a gift.4TROOPS: Live From The Intrepid
4,Roundhouse comes with Turntable,"I give 5 stars to the Roundhouse as a product (my niece would think 5 is not enough stars), but the description on the website did not mention that the Roundhouse included the Turntable. Knowing this would have saved me the effort of purchasing & then returning the Turntable."
4,No Turntable,"I was disappointed to find my roundhouse did not contain the turntable for the trains. At that price plus shipping it should. It appears to not even be offered by your company. It is part of the roundhouse, where is it? A Woods"
4,Best Price on Roundhouse,I researched the roundhouse at real stores and online stores and this was the best price. Recommended for the Thomas the Train lover... fun to put the trains in bed for the night. It does not come with the roundabout; had to buy separately.
5,Fantasic but Pricey!,"When I ordered the roundhouse I believed that the red 5-way switch track was also included, especially when it is pictured on the box, but was disappointed to find that it wasn't. As my 4 year old son believes, as I am sure most do, that this is a very necessary piece of the building he will have to wait until his birthday to receive it (...). A little upsetting.Apart from this one thing the Roundhouse is a fantastic piece to have on any Thomas layout, my son loves it and plays with it for hours."
5,A great read for those who do not travel; a must read for those who do.,"Don and Dana Manges spent extended time in the Historic European Cities of their choice. By doing so, they experienced not only the treasures each of these Cities offers, but the culture as well. I have visited each of these beautiful Cities, but only for brief periods. After reading LEAVING HOME AT 72, I would compare my visits to seeing the previews of a movie. Don and Dana, with their writing gifts, created vivid descriptions of so much more, and made me feel as if I was now seeing the entire movie. From their personal point of view, they provide information on where to live, and once you are there, where to go, what to see, the local cuisine and how to do it all. Their writing style is so reader friendly that each page is easy and pleasant to read. Don and Dana kindled in me the desire to return to these wonderful Cities, but next time to see the entire movie."
5,Exceptional Book,"This is a gem of a book. Short,simple, contains all of the basic essential info you need to use tests for a distribution being normal, exponential, or Weibull. It explains an intuitive level exactly what the test does without getting bogged down in a great deal of theory. It gives the formulas one needs to use for the tests, explains very clearly how to use them, and goes through some examples.Exceptional book: pick it up for fun as it is an easy read!Brenneman"
5,I love this book!,"I love this book, and I'm putting it on the shelves where I keep the books that are most important to me -- books like Aldous Huxley's Perennial Philosophy and Huston Smith's World Religions. Like other books on these shelves, Matter of Spirit contains stories about personal spiritual experience combined with conceptual thinking about religion -- my favorite kind of reading. The author's voice is fresh, grounded, and clear-headed so there's a solid sense of credibility. She explains difficult concepts (e.g., how to ""move"" energy or what it means to be god-centered) in simple, easy-to-understand terms. It's simultaneously practical and down-to-earth and uplifting and inspiring."
5,Keeps my Husband WaRM!,I purchased the Red Union Suit for my husband and he loves it. He works outdoors and he likes the complete coverage. Suit is soft and warm. Does the job it is designed to do.
1,red union suit,"Purchased this item as a gift. It was a fair price, so I ordered it. When it was received, it was washed once, in cold water by itself, so the red color wouldn't bleed onto other items. It shrank too much to be comfortably worn by the gift recipient, unfortunately. Would've bought the next larger size had I known, it would shrink that much.My recommendation, should you be interested in picking up this item, buy the next larger size, as it'll shrink, otherwise, you're just wasting you're $$$. ~Good Luck!~"
2,Great fit... if your over weight!,I've been looking for a union suit (or long johns) for a while now so I was excited when I saw these on Amazon. Unfortunately when I tried them on I notice a LOT of slack around the mid section and rear. I'm around 6 feet/165 pounds. I expected some slack given I'm fairly thin but nothing like this! So if your 6 feet and overweight I would highly recommend these but otherwise beware.
1,NOT 100% COTTON AS ADVERTISED!!!!,"I rate this item one star because of the blatant MISREPRESENTATION in this product's Amazon description which reads in part...'100% cotton, neck to ankles'....the product is actually 60% cotton 40% Polyester. I specifically chose this item over a competitor's because the difference between the two was that this product was supposedly 100% cotton. BUYER BEWARE"
5,Red Union SUit,The union suit was needed for a class party. It was of great quality and was received in a timely manner. The price was the best I found. Thank you.
4,"Good productr, but not for me.","I am 6'4"" and the large is not long enough for me. It's a great product, but it lacks the traditional and comical button butt-flap."
5,mouse in Shoe Puppet,"I bought this puppet because I am creating an illustrated story book to go with it. When finished, it will become gifts for my grandchildren.The puppets( I have three of them now) are wonderful! I also have the mouse finger puppets as well!"
2,"Sure it LOOKS fun, if you're into carpal tunnel......","My boys (5 and 4 thought this was awesome when they got it as a gift ... that is, until they used it. If you only have one engine or car on the track, that's fine, but if, like my guys, you have a long train set up, holy toledo, it's a pain in the you-know-what. They'll be cranking those dials until they collect social security. And it didn't seem like all the cars really FIT through there, either. Very tough to turn, sometimes. After just a use or two, my boys seemed to avoid putting using it anytime they built a track, or if they used it, it was always placed on some out-skirt bit of track, so that they didn't have to travel through it! What a waste. Asthetically and in principle, very cute idea, but in practice.... not good."
4,Cute but not the greatest,This is a cute idea. Kids can wash there thomas trains. Well it can prove frusterating. See not all the trains and cars can fit through the train wash. Some get stuck or just won't go through. THis is nice but may be to difficult for younger children. My son screams in frustertaion when he tries to do a train and it won't go through.
4,sodor engine wash,"This piece has had many bad reviews but we recently got this one and it works just fine. Maybe the manufacturer worked out the kinks because or trains go through really easy, even in a long line. One of my 2 1/2 year old sons favorites."
2,Hard and frustrating,"My son Tom loves Thomas the Tank Engine trains, track and accessories. He received the engine wash for his 3rd birthday and was extremely excited. Unfortuately it is very hard to push the trains through even when turning the handle at the top (which I or his Dad have to do). Not all of the trains fit and if, for example, James goes through his coal car alway becomes detatched. It looks very nice but I would only recommend this to children of older ages."
2,My 3yr old didn't like the noisy crank!,"My son has always loved car washes so when he saw this train wash he was overjoyed! We took it home and he ran about two cars through it, unhooked it from the track and said, ""I don't want this anymore"". It was hard for him to crank and it was very noisy and he said it scared him. He loves all things Thomas so I was surprised, but when I tried it, I could see how hard it was to do and would take a lot of elbow grease to get those cars through. Not so much fun when you have to work so hard! We took it back and got something else."
5,beautifully painted wine coaster,"I was so impressed with this company. They service was excellent. It was delivered in a timely fashion and came very well packed. I felt very good giving it as a gift, but it is so beautiful I will definitely think of using them for myself in the future when buying italian pottery. Have already recommended them to friends of mine."
2,Not easy to install,"The 3 way switch I received was what I ordered but when I turned off power and installed, the sensor indicated that the switch was being triggered but I could not get it to turn on the lights it was setup for. The fixture has 2 -60 watt incandescent bulbs but it will not seem to turn it on. Even the manual on/off did not work. I have not attempted to contact vendor for support yet."
2,"Worked for 2 months, horrible mfg support / warranty","Loved the device for the 2 months it worked. When I called for warranty because it was flickering on/off with no movement (all night long), I have to send it back and wait for them to QC it and send it back to me. I could see that in 6 months, but this is within 90 days.When it worked, it is a great device so I can recommend it highly if you get one that is not defective. Unfortunately for me, mine was defective after the Amazon return policy expired."
3,PIR does not work,"This switch detects motion and stays on if you move. With the minimal time setting, you have to be constantly moving. There is no passive infrared detection sensing your heat as the description says."
2,Troublesome,"First off, let me tell you that this will not work with fluorescent lights. If you think you will be able to get it to work with them, think again. I used this on a bathroom with regular bulb lights and it is inconsistent in it's operation. Sometimes it will turn off in the set 30 seconds and sometimes it will turn off in 3 minutes. Will probably pull it out and put back in the regular paddle switch."
2,Not a very good product for home use!,I guess may be it might be a good idea to work for the public rest area with a lot of people passing by to get it work properly. I installed it in my rest room and it 'just pained in the ass. it will shut off every 15 second or even earlier if no motion involved. Tried to set up the interval with no success. Absolutely not a good product for grandma and grandpa. ( no offence! ) Unless you have to move yourself infront of the sensor constanly and it will not work for the cfl bulb or it will keep on flicking.
3,Works OK but installation instructions a little weak.,"First, not as clear as it could be about what fluorescent fixtures this would control. It also does not say whether this can be used in a 20A circuit or not. Finally, does not say whether ground is required or not. good news is it works fine once installed correctly."
1,Successfully installed in my trash,I would return the thing if I didn't break it trying to fix it.Very Low Quality and zero QA was put into this item.Stay away.
3,Does the job,"This motion switch works fine, installation is easy I installed on the bathroom, and kids love it :)But I don't like the idea of using a fast light bulb, it should turn on any kind of light bulbs anyways it save energy."
2,No Single Pole instructions,"Has instructions for 3-way switch, but nothing for single pole. I'm still floundering around the Leviton website trying to find directions."
1,Doesn't work,Couldn't get the sensitivity control adjusted properly. Must be a defective switch.Next time I will buy one at WalMart for about the same price.If it doesn't work Walmart is right down the street and I don't have to go through a lot of paperwork and trip to stand in line at the post office to send it back.
2,"For me, it did not work with compact fluorescent bulbs","I tried using this switch with compact fluorescents, and after installing it, the switch would work in the ""on"" or ""off"" setting. However, the switch is designed to be used in the ""auto"" setting (i.e. turn on if motion is sensed and auto-off afterwards). In the auto setting, my bulbs turned on perfectly, but when they were supposed to turn off, they would not turn off completely and just flickered continuously. I've never heard of this happening before (I've heard of flickering instead of turning on, but not instead of turning off), so I'm not sure if it something peculiar to my setup or not, but after swapping out the CFL bulbs for normal incandescent bulbs, everything seems to be working fine. The bulbs are not used very often, so I don't mind swapping out the CFLs, but it is slightly annoying."
3,Does what is says (almost),"Ok, so it's easy to set up, and it works just fine, I wish it would be more sensitive. But My biggest issue was that it refuses to work with CFL or LED bulbs no matter witch ones I used dimmable or not."
4,Excellent Value...,It's hard to complain at this price...but the IR sensor could be better. I have these installed in our bathrooms and they often turn off on me. A slight movement sometimes won't activate the lights and you have to really wave and shake.
3,CFL support would be nice,"But it doesn't work with CFL's. Even when ""off"" they flicker horribly. Incandescent works fine, but how much longer are we going to able to buy these (due to overreaching, stupid government regulations)?"
2,Not for flourescents or (probably) low wattage,"I installed this on a low wattage flourescent bulb, the kind that are coiled to fit where a regular incandescent bulb would fit, and the switch would leak enough power that the bulb, although very dimmned, was still on. Had to switch to an incandescent bulb, I don't know if a low wattage incandescent would stay on as well or not."
5,great idea.,"I saw one of these in a local pharmacy restroom. What a great idea. I put two of these in the barn that I just built. Walk in with your hands full and the lights come on automatically. And with the adjustable timer that is built in, you don't have to worry about leaving the lights on.I no longer worry about leaving the lights on all night. I've got the timer set for 15 minutes. So we just walk out after we're done and the lights go out on their own. Wish I had these when the kids were growing up."
4,Not perfect but works well.,"My only real complaint is that it has issues if ambient light is shining directly on it during the day, it works but it takes a little extra prodding. Other than that I have no problems."
2,Didn't work,I had bought. 4 of these and only 2 work. I guess I will just have to pay double the price and get them at lowes.
3,switch plate not included,don't be fooled like I was by the picture. the wall plate is not included with the switch even though the picture shows it.Amazon needs to correctly show the product as it is. the description does not even say that the wall plate is not included. the product works great.I am giving it 3 starts because of the misrepresentation.
2,Sensor switch,"Great concept, but after I used my switch for a while, I realized that there are competing brands out there that do a better job. I installed my sensor switch in the laundry room. My switch requires ""additional stimulation"" sometimes before it turns on - I find myself waving at it quite frequently. It also has a short ""on"" cycle. This may also be related to the ""additional stimulation"" factor. I feel that it shuts off long before I'm ready for it. I have experienced sensor switches at others' homes that do a better job at sensing and staying on for the necessary period of time."
1,Stay way from this. You get what you pay for,"I bought two. One works in my garage, which is fluorescent lights. The other for my shed, does not work with fluorescent lights. I'm sure it's something to do with the difference in the ballasts. I don't need that hassle. The one that doesn't work also doesn't work in my hall way with a compact fluorescent.I do not have time to gamble and play with crap that works only with some items and not others. I am going to pay a few more $$ and try the highly rated lutron. Buyer beware. If it works, great... it it doesn't, it will be very frustrating. My frustration is worth a few more bucks."
1,FAILED AFTER 2 MONTHS USE,Worked A-1 upon initial installation.After 2 Months use the lights flicker in the infrared mode but work OK in the manual mode.
4,"Great for all those old incandescent bulbs, but won't work for CF or LED bulbs","I like this switch - it works great for pantry and closet lights and it is easy to install for both single or multiple switch applications. It is a great use for all those old incandescent bulbs I've been accumulating, since the light is only on for a minute or two each day.However, as other reviewers have pointed out, there are problems when you use only compact fluorescent (CF) or LED lights (no incandescent lights) in the circuit. Specifically, while set to the motion activation mode the light will remain on, but dimmer, when the there is no motion to activate the switch. It will increase to full brightness when there is motion. The lights are fully off when the switch is manually off and fully on when the switch is manually on."
5,Saves me from reaching,I installed this switch in my garage. When I open the door the light comes on right away and I don't have to reach for the switch which happens to be on the wall behind my washer. If I'm doing something in a different part of the garage I'll just switch it to on so that it doesn't turn off while I'm not in front of the sensor.
4,Great for the price,"Works great. Installed easy. My only complaint is when it turns off, you have to walk in front again- waving a hand is not enough. I put this in my walk in pantry. I am thinking of buying another one for my laundry room. I'm also very glad I didn't buy the $50 switch. This one works just great!"
3,Good and Bad,The switch worked great when hooked up to a bathroom light only but could not handle both the light and the exhaust fan (light dimmed and fan ran very slow).Decora Wall Switch with Pir Occupancy Sensor
2,"Don't use if you ever plan on using low wattage, LED or CFL bulbs","I tried using these on my low wattage stair lights, but when the switch turned off, enough energy still leaked through to keep the lights on very dimly. Also if you ever think you will be using LED or CFL bulbs in the future, this switch is not for you."
4,Works,"doesnt fit right, but thats my problem, works as advertised - need to figure out how to desensitize as it comes on too frequently!"
2,It would be awesome if it worked with compact fluorescent bulbs,"This was easy to hook up and set up. I wanted to use it with cfl bulbs in a bathroom because my guests kids always leave the lights on. It does not work properly with cfl bulbs (turns on and off randomly) but it works fine with regular incandescent bulbs. Since I got this to save money on electricity, it isn't exactly what I wanted. I wonder does anyone know if it would work with the newer LED light bulbs? If it did, I wonder if the extreme price would be worth it."
2,Doesn't play well with CFL bulbs,"- Ballasted lights (ie all cfl's) will get burned out with this -if they'll turn on at all.- Actual slider switch is incredibly weak, my kids had them pulled off within a month -on two different switches"
5,Great for bathrooms!,"These are great for rooms that go well as hands-free such as bath and utility rooms, especially if you have little ones. This model is an occupancy sensor which means that the light will come on if motion is detected and turn off after a set period of time when there is no motion. There is also a manual slider switch to force the light on or off. These are a little easier to install than the push button vacancy sensors which require a neutral connection. I've had mixed results with CFLs although traditional bulbs function the best, halogen too. Great product!"
4,Amazon customer,"I used this switch in my storage room, It works vey well and my children like it. It took time to install, but it is worthed."
1,"4 Foot range, serious?","Don't know what was wrong with mine but I cannot believe it has only a 4 or 5 range. My 3 way application does not allow for such a small range. I don't know if others are like this but I'm convinced that in this case, you definitely get what you pay for."
2,"Works, but the 'on' time is way low.","Works, but the 'on' time is way low. I put it in my 1/2 bath. What we found is that is goes off once or twice in the time it takes guests to use the room. I replaced it with another."
1,Do your research FIRST!,"Can't give an accurate star rating as I never got far enough with product to see how it performed. Just a piece of advice; research product item number on actual manufacturers website. The description on amazon doesn't tell you this item won't work with electronic ballasts. It doesn't really specify any type, but FYI it will only work with magnetic ballasts."
1,Product Sucks. Manufacturer customer support Sucks,"This product stopped working after 4 months. The manufacturer would not support, too much hassle to send something back. If the product stops working after such a small period of time, you'd think the manufacturer would step up and pay for shipping both ways. But NO!"
1,Outrageously bad.,"I paid $10 for this at Best Buy also. How bad could it be? Answer: plenty. Pin action is unrealistic, and impossible splits and spare combinations that have never been left in the 100+ year history of live bowling are commonplace on this game. I don't know what bodily dysfunctions the animated bowler suffers from, but is it really that difficult to computer animate a bowler with decent form? Finally, the varying camera angles are kind of interesting, but they make it impossible to see where the ball is hitting the pins in order to make adjustments. As far as I can tell, perfect strikes result from nose hits.Almost as bad as the Brunswick bowling game that came out a few years ago. There has not been a good bowling video game since Mattel Intellivision, which is two decades old."
2,This game sucks,"Real bowling is great. This game bears almost no realistic apperance. I guess for $10 bucks that's what you get. My four year old pressing the ""A"" button once has beaten me every time. The build a ball section is ridicilous. There is no explaniation as to what each choice means. The game control is a joke. I'm a 210 lefthanded bowler in real life. I have yet to make it to 100 with this game. The kids have more fun making the bowlers and ball then they do actually bowling."
1,Not worth the $10 I paid,"The gameplay itself is fair....maybe a 4 on a 10pt scale... but the rest of it is horrible. User Interface is terrible, it's a bowling game that doesn't keep a single stat at all. You bowl a game, and that's it. Nothing to work towards, etc. No seasons, the ""tournaments"" are weak. I am highly disappointed in this game after playing the in-depth EA sports games for the last 8, 9 years. This game lacks depth in every aspect.For everyone saying, "":it's cool cause it's bowling"".... nah. I found bowling games on the computer from 97, 98, etc which was much more in depth and entertaining than this.I'm so disappointed that I'm in the process of trying to sell the game back after having it for only 15 hours."
1,Worst game I have ever played since Pong in 1975,"If you're looking for the worst XBox game ever, this could be it. I got this at a local store for $2 in the used games section. It's not even worth that. The graphics stink. The sound stinks. It's boring. And the person who said you can win just by pushing the ""A"" button is correct. You don't even have to aim. I'm just glad I didn't pay $10 or $20 like the rest of the folks on here."
2,2/5,"what else is there to say but...it just plainly stinks, everything about it is hard, the graphics are horrible, the music is terrible and repetitive and the gameplay itself is nothing like actual bowing. i suggest if you want a good bowling experience, return the game immediatly and head to the nearest bowling alley."
4,I LOVE BOWLING,IM A BIG BOWLING FAN.IVE BEEN LOOKING FOR A BOWLING GAME FOR A LONG TIME NOW.AND NUTHING.BUT FINALLY A GAME AND A GOOD GAME TOO.BY MY EXPEIRENCE ITS A GREAT GAME AND FOR ALL YOU BOWLERS THAT LIKE TOYS R US AND VIDIO GAMES THIS IS THE GAME FOR YOU.
2,Would have much better if it was based on Ed,"Ok, enough with the ""just ok"" bowling games!!! I was really looking for a better game here. Bowling is a fun game to play, but this one is just average. My recommendation for all those future bowling game manufacturers is to make it unique. How about a bowling game based on the TV show Ed? Include all the characters, and everytime you win, there is Ed with a $10 bet to up the stakes or some free legal advice...no that has some potential for amusement."
1,DO NOT BUY it will ruin your discs,"We bought this device to clean some dvds that contain research data. Before using the device, I was able to play the DVDs on the computer but got a CRC error when I tried to copy the disc to an external hard drive. Now I cleaned the disc a couple times and it doesn't work at all on more than one computer and freezes the My Computer window when you put it in. DO NOT BUY this product unless you like wasting your money and completely ruining your discs. Regarding comment from another user, I did follow the directions exactly. Unfortunately we didn't test it out on one disc and went ahead and ruined 8 of them before checking to see whether the device was working or not."
5,One of the best,"This is a great movie. A woman wants her lover to kill her husband however, her husband can read minds. This movie has a great cast and it should not be missed."
3,bob ees review,"This book is very interesting. I like the way it talked from a diferent point of view. Instead of talking from the men's side, it talked about the women's hardship. The only thing bad about it was that in some parts of it, the excitment wears down into a boring chapter(or chapters). The story is kind of odd though. It isn't that exciting, at least not as exciting as I would have liked it."
4,murphs review,I thought this book was really interesting. She not only made the book fun to read but she also put it in the characters point of view. This allows people to get a better picture of what the characters actually were like. That is what makes this book differant from all others. So if anyone out there reads this review that hasn't read the book I highly recomend that you go out and purchase this book.
5,Inside The Walls Of Troy Review,"Inside the Walls of Troy is definetly a five star book. It is about the days of the Trojan War. It is told by Helen and Cassandra, two girls who lived the Trojan War. It was an exciting book. Our class was very lucky because we actually got to meet Clemence McLaren! She told us about her other books which seem interesting too. If you're into Ancient Greece, stories of Ancient Greece, and Greek Mythology, you will definetly like Inside the Walls of Troy."
5,"Helen of Troy, Helen of Sparta","This is a very good book. This is a story about love, war, and trickey. After we read the book, we learned about how she came up with this book. Clemence McLaren came to our school and we talked to her about her book. I thought that Helen should have done more in this book more than just watching the battles and sitting on the wall."
4,Inisde the Walls of Troy Review,"I thought that this book was okay. It started out exciting, but it soon got boring. I usually don't like to read books that are like the Inside the Walls of Troy, but I thought it seemed good after I read the first couple of chapters. However my thoughts about this book changed after reading the first couple of chapters of Cassandra's story. It began to get boring and I didn't want to read it any more. Although since we had to read it for school I continued. The book had a good ending though so I was pretty satisfied."
5,"Praise for ""Inside the Walls of Troy""","""Inside the Walls of Troy"" was my introduction to ""through the women's eyes mythology."" I absolutely loved it. I didn't want to put it down. I even ignored my teacher to read the next page. When I was reading about these women, I was not in tune with the world around me. All there was was myself, and Helen or Cassandra. I found Cassandra's story especially engrossing.Her character, was very different. She knew so much, that it was painful not to tell. She wanted to save lives, when noone would let her. At every moment her knowledge turned out to be true, I wanted to say ""D'uh!! How blind are you? She said that would happen!""If this book appealed to you, then I suggest Clemence Mclarens other works: ""Waiting for Oddyseus"" and especially ""Aphrodite'sBlessings"""

5,THE BEST AND MOST COOLEST BOOK IN THE UNIVERSE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"In school, I had to read a book so I just picked that one up and I couldn't let it go!!! It is the most exciting book ever!!! I love it!! It is so cool and I read it more than four times and it was still exciting!!! How could people give it five stars?!? It should be worth at least ten!! I will love it forever and everyone should read it. All im sayina is that it is the best book ever and nothing can change my mind about that!!! I read it all the time and when i go to sleep. It is sad, romantic, exciting and bloody sometimes and it will always be my favorite book!!"
4,Inside the walls of Troy,"This book by Cleamence McLaren was great. It gave you an idea of how it was like in Greek when the Trojan War was going on. Most books give the stories from the mens points of view, but Cleamence McLaren told the story from a women's point of view. She told it from Cassandra's and Helen's view. I wish she had more of Helen's point of view. I was also fortunate to meet here. When she visited she also gave us some hints from her next book. I look forward to reading your other books."
5,Varo's Review,"I myself, believe that this was an exellent story. It portrayed the life of how women were treated and lived during the time of the Trojan war. I learned a lot of information from this book, it was a very good introduction into the Trojan War. Not only did this book teach teach me a lot if things, it also told me the story of women during that time. Like I previously stated, I believe this was an exellant book. I will rate it a five star rating, but you should read it for yourself."
4,Z's Review,"howzit goin? I just want to say that Inside the Walls of Troy was a great book b-cuz it was deep and concentrates on women unlike alotta other books during the trojan war. I liked Cassandra's personality bcuz she seems like a very down to earth person with a pretty awesome atitude. on the other hand, Helen seemed like she was still a bit self-centered with the fact that she used polyxena to get to achilles so they could try to defeat him. I like the part when it described the part about the making of the Trojan horse. It was pretty darn nifty!well, hope to see ya laters! hip to the hop and it dont stop! ~~Z~~"
3,Interesting,"Dear reader, Our class was assigned to read this book and write a review on it. I personally thought that this book was very interesting and yet it became almost ""bed-to-bed."" What I mean by that is I think it almost was like she told everything she did that day. She meaning Cassandra. The first part of the book was very interesting. It portrraited Helen as someone who wanted to leave her husband and daughter rather than the Girl who was stolen away from her family as most books do. The auther obiously did a great job of finding usuful information and applying it to her fictional thoughts on how the charecters must have felt. And yet, I think there was too much fact and not enough fiction. But in all, I would like to say BRAVO CLEMENCE!"
4,GOOD BOOK,"In my 7th grade English class, we all read this awesome book. Throughout the book, exiting and interesting things would always pop out and surprise me. The storyline was great and I thouroughly enjoyed it. It's cool how the stories are from the point of view of the women of the Trojan War (Helen and Cassandra). Another interesting aspect of this book was that the author added in things that would be easier for the reader to undersrtand, such as frienships, and how the charachters really felt."
4,Awesome Book!,"I thought this was a pretty awesome book, but it was a little too gory for me. I love the fact that she wrote the books from two different perspectives because you know, it kinda leaves you hanging. The only thing I would change would be the part when a spear gets stuck in a warriors chest and he begins to vomit blood...I stayed up for like three nights visualizing it. :)"
5,Inside The Walls of Troy Review,"Inside of The Walls of Troy is appealing to any reader. I am in seventh grade and was required to read Inside the Walls of Troy. Clemence McLaren came to our classroom to talk to us. I could tell she is a very interesting and creative writer. She researched the main facts about the Trojan War, but made up most of the characters personalities. As you are reading, you are also learning about the war, which keeps your eyes glued to the pages. The book is written from two points of view, Cassandra and the beautiful Helen. If you are interested in Greek Gods, Trojan War, or just looking for a good book to read, I would recommend this book to you."
3,Pretty entertaining.,"This book is a light and easy to read introduction to The Iliad.I loved the Iliad and I enjoyed this little novel as well. I read it some time ago, but for some reason there are various scenes in it that stuck with me. I was thirteen when I read it, and I'm nineteen now, and yet I can still describe full scenes from this book with vivid detail.I would recommend this book to a young person, but I'd also recommend it to an adult who enjoyed the Iliad and had a long plane flight or something.To sum: fun, light, entertaining, and will refresh your memory of The Iliad and Greek mythology for those of you who are ever working to improve your Jeopardy skills."
3,i tink dis da best book in town,"aloha awinala, i from hawaiihey whats up peeps on the net. I thought that this book was very intresting and enjoyable. i live in her home land of HAWAII were the trees wave and the ocean glimers.i think that ur books are fantastic and u have a good sence of how the greek peeps lived. so if u folks out there want a good book to read read INSIDE thA WALLS OF TROY altough there were parts in neva understoodalllooooooohaaaaaa,"
1,Maybe pornography should be a womens college course aswell....,"I have a feeling this book came about by some strange bet/challenge made during a conversation at some party. Everyone has an opinion just as I have made at the beginning of this review but to believe porn is some liberation despot for women is lunacy. Only benefit that comes out of porn is she actually gets paid that's it. To consider there is some redeeming value for women being in the porn industry besides financial gain is mind blowing! No body want's their wives, sisters or daughters in that business, it's a black hole that sucks in the less fortunate souls. It goes hand in hand with the degenerate society that tolerates porn as some art form. You can have your award shows, have porn stars claiming how happy they are put them in the spot light, dress it up however you want it. In the end it is what it is the decay of our society and culture."
1,Not researched well enough to really do that much good.,I wasn't that impressed with this book although I agree wholeheartedly with her message. A very sloppy effort on her part.
5,Cheap yet reliable,"I have had this for two weeks, and it has actually improved my life. It costs about 1/3 as much as an ipod shuffle, but does not need itunes. It charges quickly, and the battery has never been low for me, even after playing music for 7 or 8 hours straight.Years later, after going through both a washing and drying machine cycle, my music player did not slow down until immersed in melted chocolate. I don't know what I was thinking. Until then, it was reliable and worth everything I paid."
4,My first MP3,"I never thought I would want an MP3 player because I am not inclined to try to figure out how to make things work. When I read the reveiws on this product I thought it sounded easy enough for me to work and it is. The price was right, sound quality is good and it is easy to use. Some day I may want to upgrade but for now I like this one."
2,Inadequate,"While the concept is a good one in that the reference is easy and the folio is well built (no visible wear after two weeks in my pocket) I found the map to be poorly designed and inadequate. The scale is too small, leaving gaps and unnamed streets and , most annoyingly, landmarks are shown as isometric images superimposed on the plan of the city. Streets behind are necessarily hidden. The Knopf MapGuide proved to be much more useful with finer resolution and landmarks shown in plan. A better option is the free map given out by the city tourist office across from the train station. It's as good a map and - free."
4,Good for Travel,"This map is perfect for travel, however, since it is a small map the print is also very small. May need to take a magnifying glass along."
5,very helpful and compact,"Just back from a week in Italy. I found this map very useful, accurate, and compact. It did the trick for me."
3,Fine print is a bit too fine...,"In order to maintain perspective, the publisher had to make the old town Florence print very small which made the streets had to identify. Lots of space is devoted to parts of Florence most tourists are not that interested in seeing. I think it would have been better to enlarge the section devoted to old town Florence and reduce the size of the surrounding area, even if it means distorting the perspective a bit.On a positive note, the map fit in the pocket of my cargo shorts very easily."
2,Get a map at the Hotel,"Listen to me - get a free map at the hotel, it is all you will need. I happen to like maps... it's a guy thing. I spent over $40 on city maps before I went to Italy. I thought they would be better since I paid so much for them. Rick Steeves told me not to do it. Rick told me to get the hotel map. I should have listened to him. The limited amount of time (a few days) most of us will spend in any major city on our trip does NOT require anything more than the map your hotel will give you. Some of the maps they provided were actually better than the ones I paid $8 for.ONE MORE TIME - get a free map at the hotel or tourist information office. Do not spend a ridiculous $6 to $9 on a little map when you can get one for free. Trust me on this one. If the freebie doesn't work for you, any tobacco shop in Italy will be glad to sell you a very nice map for 8 or 9 Euro. Fell free to send me half the money you have saved following this advice. Have a great trip!!!"
3,Not very durable,"I bought this for my three year old because he likes Thomas the Train and is very interested in cranes. He plays with it for a few minutes, until the top part (gray square that holds the crane and string) snaps out of the base. It is very difficult for him to get in back into place and even difficult for me. Once I get it put back together, it stays in for a few minutes and then comes right back out. He isn't throwing the toy around or stomping on it. The toy needs to be redesigned so that kids can play with it without having to fix it every few minutes."
5,Cranky The Crane,Cranky the Crane is fun and provides hours of excitment. Cranky's educational value teaches children how to load and unload cargo on to the compatible train cars. My Cranky is in good condition but sometimes its pulley string somtimes gets tangled while loading and unloading the cargo. I strongly recomend Cranky the Crane!
3,"Overpriced, as are all Thomas items","While I think all Thomas items are overpriced, they are well made and seem to have a timelessness about them. I would not be surprised if my grandkids will be playing with them someday. My son has been asking for Cranky for about a year and is THRILLED to finally have it."
5,Better than I expected,I am so happy with this toy. The wood is beautiful and the crane works exactly as it is described. I am so glad I chose this product
4,"GREAT PRODUCT, A BIT EXPENSIVE",MY SON LOVES THOMAS. THIS IS AN EXCELENT PRODUCT AND IT DOESNT TAKE BATTERIES WHICH IS A GOOD POINT!!!!WISH IT WOULD BE CHEAPER THOUGH
2,Cranky lost his head,"Mom of 2 boys here. I'd say we could have put a down payment on a nice little bungalow for them in exchange for what we have spent on Thomas products, but hey....we need to relive our childhood.The concept of Cranky is good. Design is bad2 cranks, 1 for up, 1 for rotationmagnet will lift train cars & hotwheels cars if you kids are into thatBoys like it. Good for fine motor. Amuses them for a few minutes.The problem is Cranky's head falls of if it is knocked over. I have glued his head back on 3 times with super glue (each time scrapping off the old glue to get the best hold) Head still falls offMy 3 year old calls the toy ""headless cranky"" because I have said he can't play with him until his head dries, that he is headlessI am not sure why they designed it for his head to break off. It could be made differently without effecting use."
2,The name says it all,Add me to the list of people who are having a maddening time with Cranky's head falling off constantly. My son loves it but is himself frustrated by this poor quality. I quite understand that with all things Thomas there are certain elements that you just have to have BUT if you're not facing desperate need from your child then I would skip it.
2,No Longer Lifetime Warranty,"Beware. Per the Learning Curve website and customer service phone rep, Thomas products now have a 90 day rather than a lifetime warranty.""Our products are guaranteed for 90 days from date of purchase under normal and intended use and service against defective workmanship and material. If our product fails to meet our limited warranty during the warranty period, we will, at our option, replace the product free of charge, or provide you with a replacement of comparable value."""
2,Not durable,"It was a ton of fun--until my 3 year old managed to break in after only a few months. Not sure how he did it--the string snapped right above where the magnetic lifting piece is attached. For $30 I expected a toy that would last. Really too bad, because my son loved it."
2,head problems,this toy was disappointing in that the head falls off way too easily. It is frustrating for a kid as well as the parent. This one needs to go back to research and find a better design.
5,Great,"This toy works so well with all the other Thomas Wooden toys. It is a great addition to train tracks. It makes playing with Thomas trains a lot more fun, since you can load and unload the trains. The crane also has a magnet to hold various items. Great fun."
4,We love Cranky,"We are serious Thomas people and Cranky is an important part of our pretending. He's invaluable when it comes to cleaning up the messes that inevitably occur during our play. He's easy to put together, sturdy, and his magnet works well with the other Thomas pieces. One of our favorite accessories."
4,Great toy but...,"My son loooooves Thomas, and loves Cranky. His favorite Thomas video of all time is Creaky Cranky. So we ordered it for Christmas, and it seems durable, and he loves playing with it. HOWEVER, if you're going to give this as a present to a very excited 3 year old, TAKE IT OUT OF THE PACKAGING BEFORE YOU WRAP IT! Cranky was screwed to two pieces of wood through the cardboard. Two of the screws were stripped, and required us to snap the pieces of wood (Cranky was okay, luckily) and use a pliers to turn the screws. The entire time my son was so excited and and upset we wouldn't give him Cranky, he was jumping up and down next to me. He's a very well behaved little boy, but on Christmas morning when you're three and want to play with your new toy, even the best kid looses patience.All the other Thomas wooden pieces haven't been this much trouble to open, so we just weren't expecting it. If not for the stress this added to our Christmas morning, this would get five stars."
2,Head DOES come off often!,"The only reason this even gets 2 stars is because my simply loves it! He is constantly bringing it to me because the head falls off. Now after pushing it back on so many times, its wore the plastic down. We've had it for 2 yrs and it works just as well as it did on day 1..........which isn't saying much. Buy it for the kids but don't expect much as a parent....except to keep puttin that head back on!!"
3,For the older Thomas fan,"My son got Cranky from Santa this year. He is 2 1/2, and finds Cranky a bit difficult to operate. His hand/eye co-ordination is not developed enough yet that he can really get Cranky to work properly. I think this toy would be better for an older child, perhaps 4 and up."
4,"Cranky arrived in great packaging, my toddler loves it","Cranky arrived packaged securely. The magnet on the rope is strong and holds items other than the cargo box that comes with him. We hung a thomas train from it, like in the movie. :) There are two cranks. One makes the rope go up and down and the other crank makes Cranky turn left or right. This toy is durable and will last for awhile."
4,"Crank me up, Scotty!",My daughter tells me that my grandson is really enjoying this expansion to his Thomas & Friends Wooden Railway set. What more could I ask for? Particularly since he discovered on his own that the magnets on the crane can be used for other items that those originally planned for!
5,Cranky the Crane,"I actually purchased this item for my 3 year old nephew. We spend a great deal of time with him, and he is an avid fan of anything Thomas the Train. I was actually surprised to see how much time my sons, 11 and 10, spent playing with this item. Many hours have been spent watching them teach their cousin different ways to build, and telling stories that relate to Thomas. It is refreshing to see them spend so much time using their imagination, (as opposed to drooling in front of a video game) and the relationship they are developing with their cousin is worth every penny. I would recommend this as a must have for anyone who buys the wooden railway sets for their child."
4,Fun,"My son has Cranky and he is happy to have him. He is 3. He gets frustrated when his head falls off, but I just assume that is because his little hands couldn't get it back on. But he likes using him as part of his ensemble."
4,Lots of fun,"My son loves that the crane really picks up ""loads"" with its magnetic lift. It was just a little less expensive than inside the stores."
2,Broke after a week,The top of the crane broke after a week of gentle use. We had to glue it. Very disappointing. Also the magnet ball is a choking hazard for young toddlers and babies.
4,I am disappointed but my grandson loves it,"I purchased Cranky for my grandson's third birthday and he truly loves it. However, I am disappointed in the overall workmanship. Cranky's head falls off way too often and my grandson has not yet figured out how to line it up correctly to put it back on. Also, the crank to lower the magnet to pick up cargo blocks and such tends to get stuck and needs some extra persuasion to lower. These are really expensive toys and the kids really love them. It is too bad they aren't put together just a little bit better."
1,2007? More like 1985 with crotch huggers and panty hose...,"The cover looks modern... BUT IT IS NOT. I guess it was my fault for not doing research and being lured in by the low price, but come on!! It was like a bad Australian infomercial from the 80's skip this one and get Amy Bento or the Firm."
4,Monsters,I was really pleased with this book. You could get lost for hours just reading about each creature. I would reccommend this book to any person who likes to read about monsters.
1,Giant Disappointment,"I was very disappointed in this book. I was expecting a more humorous approach to this subject.i It was a gift for my son-in-law, and I'm sure he was not impressed."
3,Its an Encyclopedia,"And its kind of boring.If you need a go to book for all your beasts on folk lore this is it...I however, need some romance with the Author. Someone to walk me through the legends and myths..None of this cut and dry bullshee."
4,A very concise source of information.,"I was surprised with the extensive amount of listings within the book. There is a lot of otherwise hard to find information. I would have given this book 5 stars if it weren't for one thing; there is no index. A book like this should really contain an index for those looking for particular traits, or words within a creature's definition. However there are listings in the back based on different characteristics it is not as exhaustive or all around helpful as a simple index would be. Don't get me wrong though, this book is still well worth the purchase. Besides you can search through the book for keywords on this webpage by clicking ""Search Inside""."
5,Sweet Sweet Sweet,"Another perfect addition to the baby's room! My daughter hung these over the changing table, and they currently hold the headbands she puts on her daughter. The pegs are very sturdy, so depending on how you anchor them into the wall, they should hold some weight. Very cute!"
5,Perfect for hanging,"I love this peg set! I actually used them to hang the wall hangings from, they look adorable together and each peg matched one of the wall hangings. They were a little difficult to hang but are very sturdy. They look great together or apart."
3,step up!,"I love tha Outlawz but album after album they use grimey beats with no hit making potential. Noble carries this whole album lyrically. EDI really needs to step his bars up. For Outlaw fans, not a bad album."
3,An intesting read that fails in its futurism,"I read this book under the title of ""Plague from Space"", published by Orbit Books in 1991. The book was first published in 1966, and it shows. Harrison spins an interesting tale of a plague that arrives in a manned ship that returned from a first descent into Jupiter, and how us humans handle it. The suspense is there, but unfortunately, I kept losing my suspension of disbelief because the future described in the book feels ""too old"". In particular, medicine and medical research, which are so important in this book, seem a little backward (even though some of the devices used are indeed forward looking).This is not a bad read, but anyone who wants a good Harrison book to start with would do better to pick up a copy of Death World."
2,Not quite as good as expected,"After purchasing the Faerie Tale Theatre videos, which my grand-daughter loved, we thought she might like the animated Bedtime Stories as well. She said they were okay, but didn't like the animation and of course could care less about the voices of stars she doesn't know at her age. While the skits in Faerie Tale Theatre were entertaining even to those who didn't recognize the celebrities, the cartoons offered in Bedtime Stories came up fairly short. The charm just wasn't there. She didn't want to watch all of the tape after viewing the first four cartoons."
4,Nice book,This helps to understand how a person of jewish heritage is raised. It is good if you want to understand more.
2,"Pretty boring book, purchase experience was good",This book starts off dry and doesn't really get anything going for about 100 pages. Boring book. The purchase experience was great though.
2,Einstein did his own mathematics,"The idea that Einstein's first wife Mileva checked his mathematics for the special theory of relativity is laughable. This issue has been put to rest by Einstein's biographer Abraham Pais in his 1994 book ""Einstein Lived Here."" Here is why. First the special theory of relativity requires only elementary mathematics, the breakthrough is in the concepts. Second Mileva was unable to pass her final examination in mathematics in 1900 at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (Einstein passed). She failed again in 1901 and did not receive a degree. Third Einstein was able to master the advanced mathematics necessary for the general theory of relativity which came after his divorce from Mileva. It takes a very creative reading of the documents to ascribe any role to Mileva whatsoever in the special theory."
4,I KNOW these people!!,"When I read the book, going from story to story, author to author, I got a real familiar feeling, like this is MY group of friends.The stories are interesting BECAUSE it feels as if a friend said, ""Guess what happened to me today!"" and then went on to describe a trip to the video store or some such thing.It is a very enjoyable book. If these people are indeed in the Editor's life, then he is lucky, as anyone with a diverse group of friends can appreciate."
1,Very Disappointed,Horn doesn't sound anything like the sound clip. Extremely poor quality and poor mounting system. Try it before you waste your time mounting it. Better yet buy a good horn.
4,From A to Z,"This is a decent if plain-vanilla guide to digital video for beginners. It covers pretty much everything in the realm of home-made movies, from selecting a DV camcorder to shooting clips to capturing video to your PC to editing the final product to publishing. It's primarily a how-to guide, clearly written and illustrated. (The sample video shots are low-quality, though, esp. that ugly black/dark grey cat!) Following the advice in the book will familiarize you with teh tools and techniques, esp. if you are new to video editing. Of course, nothing supplants actually D.I.Y -- doing it yourself. This book provides a good primer and reference."
3,A little surpprising,"I bought this CD because the chant ""Govinda"" was on it and that is what I was looking for. And it is there and done pretty well, but like the few other chants on this CD they it could be more brightly done. An Indian version would be better if I could find one.The ""surprise"" on this CD is that there are 4 music cuts... I skip the 4th each time I listen to it because it is so dull and heavy. And now that I have heard the 9 and a half minute cut of a question and answer period of George Harrison, John Lennon and Yoko Ono with a guru who promotes chanting as the way to enlightenment, I do not feel I need to listen to that part again. There is not really much good music to listen to on this CD.Historically it is significant, I am sure. But I was a little disappointed to know that after George and John had learned TM from Maharishi Mahes Yogi, they went off to another Guru to find out another way to enlightenment.Explains a lot about them.I expect to sell this CD soon."
1,What a load of crap!,"Jeez....I love George Harrison, but this CD absolutely blows!! There's precious little actual music on here, and what there is bites the big one!! I'd LOVE to be able to recommend it, but unless you are a masochist who likes to drop cash on junk that you hate but force yourself to listen to because it gives you some kind of weird thrill, hey, by all means buy this! Anybody else would do well to steer clear of this turkey."
3,"Hare Hare, Hare Rama","These are much more restrained chants than someone like Krishna Rah. I suppose that's reflective of the decade this record was made.This is a light, though sincere and effective, approach to enlightenment. For the average music fan, or the curious Beatle peeble, it will be nothing more than a curiosity, unfortunately. For the spiritually minded, it is a nice set piece, but not the whole cloth."
5,ONE OF THE BEST YET,"i recently read all of the reviews for Wiggles the big red ride-on car, and i was very excited to purchase it. unlike the other reviews, i did not have a problem with the shipping. one must expect a higher shipping charge for such a large item. i am very satisfied with my purchase and so are my kids."
3,Not for younger children!,"The box said it was for 1.5 - 5 years old, not so! There is no door so smaller kids will have trouble getting in and out. There is also no floor plate so they WILL slide down the hole! I got this for my 19 months old dd who is the biggest Wiggles fan. She is in the tall side, similar to a 2 year old. She sometimes could get in by herself if I hold on to the car so it does not move. She still can't get out and was once slid down the hole and got stuck! That was when I had her test run in the house while I was cooking and that was it! I had to put it away! Another thing is that, the only ""gasget"" is a horn. I would say a clicking key would be a nice addition. It is cool looking though especially with the decals and seems really rugged. I wish I got the other one that can convert from parent power (floor plate with handle) to foot power (floor removed). I have to wait until next year, may be, until I let her play with it again.. :("
5,Big Red Car is BIG FUN!!,"We got the Big Red Car for my son for Christmas. He was almost 3yrs old at the time, and he LOVES it. He gets lots of exercise pedeling it around outside. This would complete any Wiggles collection. Highly recommend!!"
3,Cute and fun but hard to get out of.,"I have 2 year old twin boys who are HUGE Wiggles fans! I just had to get them this car when I saw it. They love it, but have an awful time getting out of it once inside. I wish they had put a door in it like the cozy coupe. Most toddlers love to be independent, and mine get SO frustrated when they cant get in and out of this car on their own. So, be prepared for your little one(s) to yell for help if you buy this cute car. Good luck and enjoy."
3,Only valuable because of Wiggles logo.,"My 2 year old's eyes were as big as saucers Christmas morning when she saw this car. She has most of the Wiggles videos and toys, and knows all of the songs and dances by heart. However, in the 8 months since she's had this car, she has played with it very little. The Wiggles are high energy and entertaining, this car is the exact opposite. There are no whistles or bells, and it is just flat boring to her. Her male cousin of the same age received one for Christmas also, which has since been put away. Spend your money on a few Wiggles videos instead. We like ""Yule be Wiggling"" Christmas 2002 best!"
5,Great Car!!,"My 2 yr old son LOVES this car. We let him try the Coupe and he didn't want a thing to do with it. When we bought it we got it at Walmart for $37.77, we bought it there cuz Toys R Us had it for $49.99, but it looks like Toys R Us lowered the price finally. This is a great gift!"
3,"Son loves it, I don't especially like it","My son received this car as his 1st b-day gift. He loves it, however, he has a difficult time getting in and out of it. The biggest problem with it is the fact that it does not have a floor plate to keep a child from falling through it. So, needless to say, we have to constantly keep pulling him out of it because he gets stuck. After so many time of that, we put it away. My husband modified it by adding a floor plate he constructed. The million dollar question is though, where is the darn pole that goes in the hole in the back for pushing it?!?!?! That is what that hole is for, isn't it? Can't find it anywhere. Does anyone have any idea?"
1,Junk,"This toy is a piece of junk. It has a useless steering wheel that does not turn the wheels. We received it as a gift. Save your money, and buy something a little more practical. The only fun my son gets out of this car is standing behind it and pushing it around, and that only last a short time before he's bored and the toy is pushed to the side were it sits unused. I would not recommend this toy"
1,Horrible product,Getting the wheels connected on this car is awful. The directions say to pound a spike through the holders. Good luck getting them off without breaking at least one. A horrible product for a kid's toy.
4,Quick Reference,Overal good book and easy to read but missing some information. You need to supplement it with another text to make sure not missing anything
5,Excellent resource,This is the newest version of this excellent book. It is even better with the new info. Very up to date and complete in every aspect. Would highly recommend it for ANY Critical Care area!!
4,Critical Care Handyguide,"excellent product; a gift for my wife, RN. She carries it with her whenever at work, and swears by it. Handy, accurate, informative. Love it."
5,It's the best critical care quick reference available.,"What can I say? The other reviewers have said it all. Anything that I wrote would be simply reiterating what has already been said. This book is thorough, concise, easy to read and reference, and covers all the body systems pertinent to critical care interventions. It should be considered a mandatory addition to any serious critical care nurse's library."
1,Not worth the $$,This book does not address commonly used drugs nor does it address cordis and swan catheters. It is a difficult reference to read.
5,Holiday Gift,The purchase was a gift to my daughter. I know she has not had time to put it to good use but from what I understand the book is a great reference for anyone in the medical field. She was quite pleased to have received.
3,Quick Reference to Critical Care,i was hoping for a more overall guide to other disorders other than cardiovascular.
4,Highly recommend,I bought this book about two years ago. it is all worn and tore out because I am always referring to it. I will recommend this book to any critical care health professional. it concise and very detail. It is not a textbook so do not read it like one.
4,real country.,"the goodwill would make a nice new home for your toby keith, vince gill, and garth brooks cds. you deserve something better. buddy miller comes quickly to mind. make room in your life for some true country genius. it's a good idea. it really is."
5,What all the cool kids should be listening to these days,"Simply put: is there a sexier moment in recent music than Julie cooing ""C'mon baby take me to school""? Nope."
5,BikerBarRadio.Com LOVES this CD!,"Given the work that Julie/Budd have done in the past I went out of my way early this morning to get this CD that was hot off the press! Soon As I got to my car I had it blaring...Soon as I got to my computer I had a few MP3s from it playing on BikerBar Radio.Wonderful CD... top to bottom... I really like ""Forever Has Come to an End"" , ""The River's Gonna Run"" and ""Dirty Water""...but to my ear.. there is not a bad tune!Get It... Play it... Crank it!!... If you hate it...I will buy it from ya!! ( not worried )Michael"
2,"It's alright, nothing more","In fact everyone was praising this album and my expectations were high indeed. Well, first I can say that I would never call this release a masterpiece or even a great album, even if there are some good moments. In my opinion, Julie Miller isn't that great as a singer since her voice becomes rather boring and even whining in the long run - in small doses she's so much better. And as for the songs, there are a couple of high standard, like ""That's just how she cries"", but the overall material doesn't touch me the way I was hoping for. I guess the musical direction on this album can be described as alternative country but it's far from cutting edge. It's a decent effort - nothing more and nothing less."
4,DON'T keep your distance,"I'd like to think I'm aware of all superb musicians out there, but Buddy & Julie were completely unknown to me before I caught Emmy Lou Harris last summer & Buddy was doin' her lead guitar work. I was awed by his talent...and then Julie came out to sing and I thought WOW! So of course I availed myself of the internet and scored this gem.This disc scores on all fronts --- superb musicianship (though I'll confess Buddy's brilliant fretwork is not as ""in your face"" as it is live), excellent songs (Julie pens amazing stuff) & VERY tasteful covers. I'll confess I have recommended this to a select few friends -- only cause I'm from northern climes and it has the 'feel' of a country album -- but it has endured in my frequent rotation list and is highly recommended!"
2,Too much money for what I got.,The amount of money I spent on this product and shipping was way to much. It's not even heavy wood. It's a light weight little box and it gets knocked over fairly easy. I could have bought one for 20$ more and not have payed any shipping and I would have gotten a heavier more solid piece. I am disappointed. My daughter will use it though. I'm to busy to deal with sending it back.
3,Good for newbies but experienced programmers should avoid,"This book provides the basics of PHP programming in an easy-to-read format. It also provides a simplistic discussion of many of PHP's benefits, including cookie management and auto responders. Its lack of detail, however, will frustrate those who already have experience in programming Perl, C++ or other OO languages. For example, the book introduces the mail() function with a light code example, but does not indicate or even hint that configuration must occur somewhere with sendmail (on the linux box) or an outgoing smtp server (for windows). I would recommend this book to non-programmers who want a quick-and-dirty intro. to PHP, but experienced web app. developers should look elsewhere."
1,Soft metal,"The shoehorn bent after the first use with new chukka boots. For shoes, it may be OK if the shoes are loose fitting and the shoe horn is just to save bending the back."
2,Very strange,It's hard to keep reading about someone you don't like and whose behavior is hard to understand. I do not recommend it.
4,For Bread Machine Loaves,I needed something to store whole loaves of bread made in my bread maker. These bags work great for short term storage or gift loaves. I wouldn't use them for long term storage...more than a few days - for fear of mold developing due to lack of ventilation.
5,Teeter Hang Ups,"Anyone who suffers though chronic back pain and feels the need for daily relief, this would be the solution. I use this all the time. My advice is to buy Teeter bar as well as the the gravity boots together. You will save at least 50 dollars. Very happy with this. My biggest problem was where to install it in my apartment."
3,It was useful,"This book was very useful to me. I started to work with Visio not without the previous experience with ConceptDraw, but this book with good examples and explanations helped me to master Visio quicker."
1,Boring and Trite,"The author rambles like a brook, inanely going on about nothing and everything. Obviously the editor of this book has never even cracked the cover. There are no breaks to distiguish between past and present. One point I was continually having trouble is which character was saying or thinking which as voices and thoughts were not clearly marked. Poor penmanship detracted from what would have been a good story.As for why this is listed under the gay search engine, I can not fathom. There was nothing overtly or subtly gay about this book."
2,cheap cheesey elevator pop,"I was first very impressed by some of his songs I heard over internet radio (esp. All things End from Sleeping on the Edge of the Who). Then I listened to the CD the first time and I was very shocked. The fist song ""stormchaser"" already shows this cheap and cheasy quality when the piano starts playing.He uses simple harmonies and simple Joe Michel Jarre/elevator music like melodies and synthesiser sounds. Although the CD has some good moments I cannot recommend it."
1,Returned it,I'd always heard good things about the score and I was hoping to find a re-mastered version of an older performance first issued on LP. This CD has poor recording quality of less than skilled performances.
5,Versatile Performer,Hillary Daw captures the required style in every instance on this very varied CD. The Weill selections are seldom sung this well by an American artist. Her high notes are unreal.
5,Reappearance of a hard to find book-,"This book, I believe, is a republished version of the English translation of Professor von Rad's earlier book, The Problem of the Hexateuch and other Essays."
3,worked one year,"worked about one year. the plastic shell makes it a litter bit different from the others, comfortable, but cannot hold for long time."
1,"BEWARE, NOT ORIGINAL VERSIONS!!","These are re-recorded versions of her hits & not good ones at that. If you`re looking for the great 70`s R&B & disco sounds, this Cd isn`t it. The biggest disappointment was the wrong versions of the early Fame (Dave Crawford produced)hits. They are all 70`s Muscle Shoals classics."
5,Excellent,"The pieces were easy to assemble. The set is easily maintained and kept clean. One year after (granted minimal use), I have no concerns and/or complaints.-Richie Etwaru"
5,Great customer service!,"I loved how this set looked online-- a lot of the other espresso dining table sets seem too monotone, and I loved that this one not only had a beautiful checkered pattern on the chair backs, but also had light cushions for the chairs. The set arrived within 4 days and was simple to put together-- took me a bit of time to figure out the first chair, but I put it together by myself within a few hours. There were some very minor scratches on a chair and on the table, and the customer service rep was very courteous in sending me a repair kit the same day! They really do have great customer service and are easy to get a hold of. Overall, it's a great set and I'm happy that it adds a decorative touch to my small dining space-- can't wait to use it!"
5,GREAT,LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS DINNING SET GREAT VALUE EASY TO PUT TOGETHER AND PERFECT SIZE FOR WHAT I NEEDED HIGHLY RECOMMEND
5,I'm a straight guy...and even I liked it,"I'm a ""Enter the Matrix"" kind of guy, but even I liked this movie. It is a very sensitive movie about 2 women trying to make the right decisions about their bad relationships, and how they are able to cope with their troubled daughters.Great movie to watch with your kids. Buy it!!!"
4,Worthwhile Family Film,"Excellent performances by the entire cast. Alexa Vega's talent should make her a star for years to come. Heart-warming, uplifting story -- for the whole family. There are villains and heroes/heroines to hate & love. 4 stars PLUS! Well worth seeing."
5,*Great Movie With A Message!*,A movie for all to see.It really makes you appreciate life.Lets you see to be grateful for everything and not take things for granted.Life is wonderful and can be fulfilling.
5,Follow the Stars Home,Worthwhile movie that you'll watch more than once. Upped it to my favorite movie section.
3,Follow The Stars Home,The movie was ok. I just felt that it was too short to have too much going on.
4,Good movie!,"I like this movie--That's all that counts. But if I may say a few words of--suggestions, it could have some extra features that other DVD movies normally have."
4,Follow The Stars Home,"A great movie, but not a Christmas movie - don't know how it got labelled that! Great acting and a good storyline. Enjoyed it."
1,still waiting to receive this it was estimated by apr 2nd here it is the 7th and i still have not got this movie,still waiting to receive my movie one of the first things i ordered and i have yet to get it
5,Just what the doctor ordered...,"This movie has been purchased by my daughters as well as by me. We have had the good fortune to know people who have lived such as this young woman, who have given so much of themselves. It is a reminder of the joy that being true to oneself and being of service can bring."
5,A Wonderful Story,A wonderful story of a mother's love for her handicapped child. The husband who walked out on her and the doctor who cared for the child and loved the mother. Truly a heartwarming story.
5,Tells it like it really is!,"The field of health, safety and the environment is a complex arena, and it refreshing to see a book that was written with the intent to inform, without being boring or pontificating. The case studies are real, the information found in the appendices is an added source of valuable information, while the footnotes in each chapter provide a good tie in to related books and articles. It is well worth its price, which is a bargain by technical book standards. If I were a college professor, I would use it as a textbook for its rich sources of information."
4,Pour les débutants,"Excellent livre pour ceux qui n'ont jamais fait de bandes dessinées. Le livre est drle et bien expliqué. Le livre s'adresse aux jeunes principalement. Il ne vous apprendra rien au niveau du dessin mais explique bien comment raconter une histoire et la rendre dynamique. Très illustré. Pas d'exemples tirés de ""vraies"" BD."
1,Don't buy this,"I purchased this system from Watson's of San Antonio. I get this message system halted. I tried emailing and calling Chicago Gaming several times and I never get a response from them, They ignore me to put it bluntly. I called the place I bought it from and they were able to get me a replacement disc which was no help. Now I'm going to see about sending this back and getting a refund. Don't settle for this machine that crashes on you and you have to reach up top and turn it off and turn it back on for 3,000 dollars."
5,THIS IS MIGHTY!! A STRONG ALBUM...,"I can't even find the words 2 describe this album. Amazing. Zyklon has picked up where The 4-mer Emperor left off.Zyklon of course, has the more Death sound, faster guitar progressions and drums. The lyrics R absolutely amazing and in this Japanese version...There's alot of nice treats...NOT just 1 bonus..Buy it and see. All I have 2 say is (being a musician in my own Death/Black Metal band), Zyklon will be here 4 us, 4 a long time...This MOST IMPORTANT style of music is being taken more seriously now, NOt quite like it should, but we're getting there. [...]"
3,Works OK but very weird install,"First, this thing has a miter slot with no bottom groove, so you cannot use the full depth, but it does allow me to more fully use my Osbourne EB-3 miter gauge. Install is very challenging. The item has an unusual adjustment system that required about an hour to get right. The lip that is supposed to match up with your miter slot would not get parallel with the table saw table until I added two large washers. The slot was way too tight and required some serious file work to make it work. I like it, but it was a bear to get right."
5,My favorite permanent markers!,"These markers are amazing! Very solid and vibrant colors. They do bleed a little bit, but what markers don't. These also come in a 36 pack with a huge variety of colors (which I have also bought). Better value than buying Sharpie markers and are just as good, if not better!"
5,Bic mark-It Color Correction is Awesome,My kids love these markers. They stay nice in the case for traveling and use at school and anywhere else. They last a long time and have nice color.
4,Full color selection. Durable. Convenient.,"A full color selection and a durable marker. The point is fine without being fragile. The line thickness drawn is similar to what you would get from a dull #2 pencil. When dry, the color is a pretty close match to the shade of the marker cap. There is essentially no odor. It does take 10-20 seconds for the markers to dry when used on a slick surface, so in some cases it would be important not to brush against what was just drawn. The packaging is a very handy tri-fold case, providing a great way to store them all.Overall, I would recommend it. A quality product and a convenient package."
4,Color me impressed!,"These Bic Mark-it markers are great. Although it's odd to need a permanent marker in EVERY color, it could come in handy from time to time. Literally every color is included in this pack; and the container organizes the markers well - it's not just a throw-away package.The rubber grip is nice for extended use. The markers have nice fine tips, but I don't think they will stay that way for long. I wouldn't buy these for kids (besides the risk of walls being colored), I think the tips would wear down quickly.I've really enjoyed having them around for organizing bins, etc. I think they would be great for creating posters, too."
3,Bic Mark-It Color Collection Permanent Marker,I am disappointed in this item because the color of the ink is quite different from the color on the pen.
4,So many colors!,"I love that there are so many colors to choose from! Like Sharpies, these are permanent, but they do take a bit longer to dry than sharpie markers (and getting impatient to test it before it's completely dry will leave you with a smeary mess, which is why I only gave this four stars). However, if you make sure to not touch your writing for 60 seconds or so, these markers are every bit as permanent as the Sharpies I've used."
4,Great selection of colors,"This kit comes with a great selection of colors! The only reason for the one star deduction is that some of the colors don't show very well. The pastel colors in general lack pigmentation and appear watered down when used on plain white paper. On anything but white paper, you're not likely to get a true to color result which is a shame as I generally don't use these types of markers on paper... As for fine tip, I was hoping for the metal tipped sharpie pen that you can occassionaly find but these are felt tipped so be aware that it is definitely a marker fine as opposed to pen fine."
5,Love them!,Great value markers - Great for colouring mandalas :) My daughters love them. Would definitely buy it again... Thanks for the product.
5,Color me happy,Item took a long time to ship but was exactly as shown in the picture. Very happy with the price and size.
3,Good But,"My wife is a teacher. She loves loves loves the colors and the design of these markers.However, they do not last near as long as Sharpies do. She makes a lot of hand done posters for her room. She wanted to use these since they would greatly expand the color choices from the Sharpie staples. But she goes through 2 complete Bic markers until they are used up to fill in the same space 1 Sharpie can do the job in.They are perfect for scrap booking, drawing, and other light use, but not the heavy duty use some people need."
4,WAY better then Sharpie!!!!!,"First I must say Bic Mark-It's fine tip markers are far superior to Sharpies. While I love Sharpies range of colors, I HATE using them because of their lack of archivalness, within a couple of years they begin fading and often get a ugly hue effect around the colors. Whereas Bic Mark-Its have an almost identical color scheme but are made with an acid free formula. I use these in my visual journals. If archivalness is important to you go with Bic. I must say though I do not like Bic Mark-It's Extra fine point. I bought two six packs and there were two dried out. On the other hand I have recent bought two 36 counts and one 24 count of the fine points and have had no issues with dried out markers with the fine points. I stocked up during a deal and opened each pack and tested each marker. I LOVE THIS PRODUCT and truly hope they are around for a long time!"
3,"good medium weight tip, great bold color, not for delicate work","Great markers at a much better price than any of the stores I looked in. Amazing selection of beautiful bold colors. ""Fine point"" is good for some writing and drawing, but still a bit too broad and bleedy for delicate projects. Because of this and the absence of any really light colors (even the light colors come out pretty dark on paper), I am still searching for a set with finer points and some paler colors. Still, I feel this is a good set to round out a larger marker collection."
3,"Nice selection, but colors not as the caps","It's a nice selection of colors, and they're good enough if you're a kid just messing around. As I was planning on using them for working out my crafts projects, however, I have to admit I'm a little disappointed, especially with the ""pastel"" shades. Few of the colors are anything like the packaging, and the pastels especially are way off and much darker than the caps would suggest. Ended up having to make color samples and sticking them to the pens for reference. Also, the colors come out completely differently on slippery non-absorbent surfaces (like plastic covers etc.) than on porous ones (such as paper). If you're happy with the color, they're permanent enough on plastic, though they have the unfortunate tendency (like most basic markers, so that's understandable) to leave movement marks - every line you draw will show separately. You'll have to look at professional-grade markers for true-to-label non-transparent shades.Overall, good basic markers."
2,BIC Mark it,"These permanent markers are pretty bad! The colors don't match the caps! They are really thick, unlike Sharpies. If you need permanent markers, STICK WITH SHARPIE!!"
4,Great for stained glass coloring books,"I bought these to use with several stained glass coloring books. I rather like the way they work with the coloring books. They give good color that is clearly colored, but still see-through when held up to a light source. They are clean and all pens work flawlessly. I would recommend these to anyone looking for a good permanent marker."
3,Good alternative to more expensive alcohol markers,"The colors are mostly vivid and bright in this 36 marker pack. I found the darker ones did not blend as easily as the lighter colors. The pastel colors, namely the pink, purple, green and blue were far better to use for blending. These markers are a great alternative to supplement a growing alcohol marker collection, especially if you use them with the blending pen."
5,Great gift!,I really enjoyed getting this marker set in the mail! I haven't been able to find this selection of permanent markers in the store before. I use them for drawing on canvas and I couldn't be more pleased! :)
1,Not really permanent,"While I'm sure these would stain your clothes and the colors themselves are alright I purchased these permanent markers to write on plastic surfaces. They didn't work for what I needed. The ink pools and puddles when I use them. My sharpies worked fine on the same surface.If I wanted just pretty colored markers I would have gotten a different type of marker, but I needed permanent makers and these did not fit my needs.I can't speak for other projects, but I will state, these do not work on plastic surfaces. If you need to write on something only a permanent marker will stay on, then do not get these."
4,"Great Selection and Vivid Colors, Don't Last Long","The title pretty much says it all. These markers have a really great selection of colors. They come in a cleverly designed fold-out book-type case and the colors are really beautiful. The problem is they don't last as long as other permanent markers I have and used in the past. For big projects that require a-lot of color fill, you will probably want to look elsewhere. If you are an artist looking for a small format color medium, or a handyman looking to do some serious color coding, give these a try."
3,"Great palette, but could last longer","The BIC color collection is a great assortment of permanent markers in a reusable clear case.The three tray packaging makes it easy to locate the color you're looking for and takes up minimal space.The pens work well, although they are not as durable as Sharpie markers -- but they're also much cheaper."
2,Disappointed myself by not thoroughly reading description,My mistake ... I thought I was getting 48 different colors but this package is for 6 packages of 8 markers each. Please read the description before buying!
2,nice colors...but,These markers did not even last for 2 hours /one school project poster before running out of ink. The tips run dry and you can use the sides for a while but they too run out of ink. You can shake them to get more ink but then they splatter permanent marker all over the place. I had to say bye-bye to my favorite pants and I had red ink on my hands for two days. My daughter cried because her project would not be completed in a timely fashion. ...next time the sharpie variety pack.
5,The Plex,"This CD is amazing. This CD is groundbreaking. This CD is energetic. AND YET, this CD doesn't do the band justice! One of the best live bands around. They play the CD note for note with even more energy and drive.Worth your time to check out these guys! Buy the CD, check out some of their more recent work via their various websites (MySpace, Purevolume, etc) and ENJOY."
1,Could be made better,I ended up throwing this out because it got so annoying trying to keep it on the counter or table without it rolling in. I was so hard to wash too because of its size. Again I would recommend investing in a more expensive but better food-safe silicone mat.
3,Ok but Not Necessary,"I was hoping that this mat would prevent sticking more than Wax Paper or Parchment, but it didn't - still had to use WAY too much Confectioner's sugar - which I find alters the taste of my fondant. The measurments are great, but once you figure out your dimensions, you can gage by site."
4,"Works nicely, non-stick, easy to clean","My only caveat is that it moves around a bit when rolling, but that is probably to be expected. Otherwise it is very easy to use and is wonderful for making croissants, pie crusts, etc..."
3,Not what i expected,"I was looking for a pastry sheet and this is for fondant. I am not sure how I ordered the wrong thing, but I guess I did. It seems like a nice product, but not for what I was looking for."
1,It's crap! A worthless waste of money!,"I agree with the other reviewer who gave it a one star on all counts. In fact it deserves zero stars!As I roll out the fondant the mat slides all over the place and curls up on me so I can't even see what I'm doing. It is very easy to get creases in and impossible to get them out, so when you roll the fondant it has big creases in it. There is no storage container for it so it gets dirty easily and doesn't clean up well.It's a good idea but what a shamefully cheep product by Wilton. There are other mats that do the same thing but stick to the counter and come in a storage container. I bought one by Epicura, a non-slip pastry mat. It's almost identical to the Wilton one but a tad smaller and way better quality. It was also less expensive."
2,CRAP CRAP CRAP!,"This worked great for maybe three cakes, then it sucked. Every time I used the lines to cut fondant lines(I even used the Wilton PLASTIC rotary cutter thingy)it left dents/lines in the mat which, in turn, left lines/dents in the fondant, not good. maybe should just be called the roll mat, because roll AND cut, not so much.Not to mention it is flimsy as all get out and edges roll up. I still needed something with a grid for my fondant and I just can't work the $ of a silicone one right now so I went to my local fabric store and bought a 36"" piece of vinyl(the thickest they had), put that over the top of the Wilton crapper and I actually have an ok workspace. Defiantly would not by another Wilton mat though."
2,Save your money,"This mat is garbage and barely lasted a month. If you roll it up to store it, it stays rolled up and even taping down to a table after that is hard. It's cheap ""table cloth"" like material as another reviewer mentioned. Don't bother. One upside to this mat is that, if you can get it to stay down on a hard surface, it had a gridmark on it which allows a super easy way to cut straight lines of fondant along with a ruler. Other than that it's a total waste."
1,Worst Wilton Product,"Wilton usually has awesome products. This is the exception to that rule. It wouldn't stay put while I tried to roll out my fondant. So I taped the corners down to the table. I would say it would be fine to just use for decorations but I am willing to bet that if you press to hard when you try to cut, it would tear the mat. Horrible, horrible product."
3,"Cheap, cheap (and not in a good way)","The mat itself is okay when it's in use, but be careful of rolling it and storing it in the box because once you try to use it and roll it out again, it's almost virtually impossible. I had to have something on each end of it to keep it weighed down so it didn't unroll. I decided to order a Silpat baking mat instead. This is a very cheap item and frustrating to use."
1,A Pain To Use,"I bought this for rolling out fondant, it is such a pain to use I threw it away. It keeps curling up, so I had to tape or anchor down the corners. Just wasn't worth fighting with it. Save your $$ and get a silicone mat."
4,Multi purpose Mat,"I bought this because I roll out fondant for my cakes, dough for pie crust, sugar cookies even rolling out pizza dough. This a good product you need to put a non skid mat under it or a wet kitchen towel to prevent it from sliding the only thing that I don't like is it wrinkles easily and when your rolling out fondant you don't want any wrinkles. I keep it rolled up to prevent some of the wrinkles. I'm going to purchase another one so I can put one on top to roll out my things and use little flour."
1,Useless,"I decorate cake for a living and bought one of these mats to use to roll out fondant thinking the mat would make it easier to lift a large piece of fondant. Well, the mat is difficult to use for any purpose because it will not fully roll our flat. It constantly wants to curl up, rendering it useless."
4,Getting Rady To Use,"I ave not had a chanceto use, however, it looks good. Packagied nicely and arrived quickly. Will let you know."
1,won't stay flat and slides everywhere! awful!,"I bought this mat when I first started taking Wilton cake decorating classes. And while I love the classes and most Wilton products, this one is NO GOOD. I am now a cake decorator with many cake orders a week, and this thing is not cutting it. first of all, it's completely curled up and I have to use objects to weigh down the edges, which only get in the way of my rolling. Then, it slides allll over the place while I'm applying pressure with a roller, so it slides away and leaves indents on my fondant. It's junk. I love the measurements though, but that's it. I'm going to go look for a silicone one or something. anything that lays flat and sticks! this is a joke of a product. if they simply put weights in the corners and grips on the bottom, it would be a 4 or 5, but without that, it's useless :( I tried tape, but tape doesnt stick to it"
2,Quickly gets old,My son loved this toy for about a month. Only the three balls that come with it will fit through it (the roll-arounds are too big) and it is limited in it's interaction and versatility.
4,"Glad they are coming out, but prefer season-by-season format","Once again, Warner Bros. is presenting the series in ""Best Of"" format rather than ""Season-by-Season"" format that most fans prefer (hence my rating of 4 instead of 5). Anyway, the episodes themselves are excellent. The volume 3 comprises of: - The One With The Blackout - The One With The Candy Hearts - The One Where Ross and Rachel... You Know - The One With The Football - The One That Could Have Been (Parts 1 and 2) The volume 4: - The One With Chandler In A Box - The One Hundredth - The One With All The Revolutions - The One Where Ross Got High - The One With The Proposal (Parts 1 and 2) Each episode is presented with few minutes of additional footage, as well as documentary that shows behind-the-scenes footage."
5,Can't wait to own but still hoping for release of seasons.,"I for one think that the choice of episodes is outstanding for the upcoming volumes, and I definitely feel that this is a must buy for any true ""Friends"" fan. I thought that the first two volumes, although great, were missing some of the best episodes which will be carried on the new volumes such as: ""The One With the Football"", and ""The One With the Proposal."" And although I would still like to see ""The One in Vegas"" released, I am definitely satisfied with their choice of episodes....My one and only complaint is that I would like to see entire seasons released in full in the USA. I'm hearing that they can be bought in Europe and am still wondering why we're not seeing them over here. Oh well, hopefully they'll be soon to follow....Anyways, this DVD gets two thumbs up from me."
4,"Great episodes, but...","I am witholding a star because I was disappointed with the documentary they used as a special feature on BOTH volumes. It was a good documentary, but more technical than dealing with the cast members, and it was shot two years ago. I WISH that they had put in the outtakes special that was on last season (the one that Conan O'Brien hosted)on at least one of the volumes. That special was so funny! Besides that complaint, the episodes are hilarious, and I recommend it to anyone!"
2,I put the cart before the feeder!,"I thought this was a beautiful feeder & purchased it thinking I would add hummingbird seed for my gorgeous hummers to eat along with their nectar. That was before I learned that hummingbirds do not eat seed. They eat tiny bugs & spiders and feed on nectar only. I don't understand how a seed feeder can be sold that is only usable for larger birds and maybe a candle lantern. I will keep it for one of these purposes, but don't recommend this if you really want to attract hummingbirds."
4,"X-Clan ""Return from Mecca""","What a return! What a comeback! When I was a teenager, X-Clan was one of my favorite groups. They were a way more radical, pro-black, pro-Africa version of Public Enemy. Brother J was just as good a MC as Chuck D, but X-Clan gets no respect.So this album picks up where their first left off. It's been about 15 years, but this actually meshes well with the older stuff. The beats are updated a bit. But they're still hard, upbeat and militant.Brother J has one of the greatest deliveries/ flows/ presence on the mic. They borrow enough of the old lyrics to make it familiar to those of us who were fans back in the day. But it's not like it's a straight remake of To The East, Blackwards.""Return from Mecca"" is definitely recommended to anyone who likes that old-school hip-hop. This is music for true hip-hop heads, backpackers and college students.... Good stuff... which probably means no one will buy it."
4,lyrics and knowledge,"A lyricist, dope beats and knowledge are the key elements to a dope conscious album. Funkin' lesson hits all the categories on the head with this new release from x clan. When I heard a new album was coming out after the long hiatus I questioned if brother J still had it. Well I saw x clan live when they came to chicago with public enemy. needless to say I left the concert with x clan's new cd in my hand. Not only does brother J shine on the album but he also has some nice guest appearances (Krs-One, Chali 2na, Jr. Gong Marley). It is good to hear a solid album that actually has some substance to it instead of wack material lyrics with a wack dance to accompany the weak track. This release gets two thumbs up from me."
5,Return from Mecca,I am not a huge rap or hip-hop fan but I enjoyed this album. They do not seem as angry as some rappers might. It makes me want to learn how to dance hip-hop. It is what this genre of music should sound like. It is back to the basics of hip-hop for the group X-clan.
1,Love the original xclan line up but this is laughable...,Even Brother J cant save this mess of horrible C grade beats and rhymes (minus J) and guests like Papa Roack are you kidding me WTF. I paid $@ on here and I feel ripped off.
1,Lovers of Old School Beware,"1st, I don't want to take away from X-Clans positive messages, but if you were a fan of the 1st X-Clan album, you might not like this one. Find some place to listen to it before you waste your money. This incarnation of X-Clan sounds nothing like the previous X-Clan. Most of the production is garbage. No FUNK at all. Nothing new or innovative either. If you enjoyed the 1st album, beware of this one!!"
4,Nice,"If you like In Flames, COB, Skyfire, Soilwork type stuff you'll probably like these guys. Deathy vocals, good skills, just a good album. Has some slower bridges, but overall a good melodic death album."
5,"Poignant,but uplifting","This is a sad commentary on the meanness of human beings, but it it is also a book about th joy of family and innocence. Amazon prices and delivery speed are amazing!"
1,Wheat Bread Not Hawaiian Sweet Bread,I was so disappointed. This does not taste like a hawaiian sweet bread. It is a Wheat bread. After 3 hours of making it. I sliced in and it was a wheat bread. For a wheat bread it was ok. But if you want a Hawaiian Sweet Bread pass this one up.
3,Kid Pleaser,"Great bright colors. Really sets off the bedspread. But, the ESPN logo, although small, in the middle of the sham is a bit tacky."
4,Don't let the band name fool you...,"The first major release of Overland Park, KS based trio, Shallow put out this memorable album when everyone else in the area was shelling out the most (pun intended) shallow junk you could imagine...Sounding like a cotton candy extacy high, Julie Shields' voice will guide you through well crafted tunes that will linger in your head long after the CD stops spining...Look for Seedy Bonus Track to remind you of Zep's Moby Dick but you'll be hard pressed to find anything else here to compare.If you enjoy this CD, go take a look at a new band called The Capsules, which is made up of the two front men (one man, one lady ^_^) from Shallow who have since basically disbanded as of this writing...A great CD by Shallow, but if you can have only one Shallow CD, look for High Flying Kid's stuff, as it's the band's hole in one slam dunk..."
5,disposable brushes,I use these for spreading wood glue - and for doing small areas of stain. The unit cost is much lower than other sources.
4,Almost perfect,"These brushes work just fine for things like contact or rubber cement. Use them for the job and dispose without any effort to clean the brush. Only one caution: some of the brushes may have a loose, or extra long fiber. Be sure to remove, or trim with scissors. Otherwise the errant hair makes neat application difficult. A good product that I will keep in my shop."
1,Don't buy this paperback for a child--text reformatted,"The paperback is some sort of alien publishing-on-demand reissue. It has very few pages with lots of text crammed onto each line and lots of lines crammed onto each page. Give the child in your life the wonderful audiobook dramatization, read by the author."
1,Extremely poor layout drags down a good yarn; don't waste $$$!,"I wondered why this little book was so cheap, and the terrible layout is more than enough to explain it. First-time readers like me will find that the inconsistent visual identification of chapter breaks very confusing. With this edition, if you hope to read this story to your kids, or to have kids read it for themselves for the first time, prepare for needless puzzlement. Those already familiar with better editions will be sadly disappointed. This delightful story deserves better layout treatment, so spend more for a better edition."
5,"Humorous, adventurous, sad and hopeful","Hurrah, there ARE other people who read the book! One of my favorite books, from childhood on. Always hoped for a sequel--bring on the cookies!"
5,To infinity and beyond...,"I have a Macmillan Reading Spectrum copy of this book that was given to me years ago, its in miserable shape. Always a favorite - and now I want to pass this on to my niece. Surprised to find it out-of-print with so little information about the author. Someone save this book! Here it goes: Do it for the children! :)"
2,anti-science and generally tedious,"The Phoenix was slightly endearing, with its pomposity and bluster, but only slightly.Our protagonist, David, did not win my sympathy at all. Almost the first thing he does is try to bribe the Phoenix, with cookies. Then he and the Phoenix find a sleeping creature and try to hit and kick it awake so it will tell them something. In the audio version, David's voice is annoying.The villain of the book is The Scientist. I'm offended by the portrait of ""science"" as hunting and killing for no good reason, and by the implication that science and magic are mutually exclusive with magic being cool and good and science being evil.The narrator of the audio version, who is also the author of the book, talks with a wide-eyed, overly explanatory inflection, like he is talking down to kids.I did not finish the book because I did not care about the set-up or the characters. I know this book is a big nostalgia hit for many, but by today's scale it's low-quality."
5,I put the book down and dreamed it continued. . .,"I must have been nine or ten when I first read this book, which was, I believe, first published in 1954? This book took me on a journey every night as I read it with the transistor radio turned on so my mother would think I was asleep. It stood out for me so much, that in 1991, I painted a Phoenix on a huge 54"" by 54"" bedsheet spread over a two-by-four frame to honor it and our library here, which had burned down in 1987 and had since ""risen from the ashes,"" with the Phoenix as its symbol. As that child of nine, I took many night-time journeys after reading different chapters and couldn't tell where the book ended and my dreams began. It wasn't until 1991 that I re-read the book, after finding it in that very same library, that my dreams were what I remembered more of than the book. Thank you, Mr. Ormondroyd, for helping to kindle the imagination of a young girl! =)"
5,After the first 50 reviews who needs another???,"Hallelujah!!! This book was in desperate need of a reprint. I just bought it, again, and let my children read it. With the original artwork included, this is a must have. People say if you like Harry Potter, but that doesn't do the book justice. This is the Holy Grail here. You will laugh and cry and fear for the characters and fall in love with them too. And sadly, you won't want the book to end, but it will. When will we see David and the Phoenix again?"
4,david and the phoenix,"was remembering this book from childhood, and found it on amazon.com.it was received with delight and it was in decent shape considering the age of the book! and how fun to read it again!"
5,A Hidden Classic,"Indeed this story of a lonely boy befriending THE Phoenix, their adventures with other mythological beings, escaping the evil scientist and the bittersweet climax is powerful, and lasting. I am happy to say this ""hidden classic"" will soon be a motion picture, introducing this great story to a whole new generation... and re-introducing it to their parents still so fond of it."
3,"Easy to use, second time around","After receiving a faulty first speaker, this subwoofer has performed flawlessly. It delivers good low end bass with minimal distortion. Amazon customer support is the best and quickly sent me a new speaker. I have had it installed in my ski boat for about two years and have no regrets."
5,He loves them!,"My son LOVES Thomas and anything that has to do with Thomas. These bridges are great. They are durable, come with little pieces of wood to attach to each end to keep the ramps from falling off, and are a great addition to Thomas and Brio tracks. I highly recommend them as an addition."
4,"Love this, but . . .","I bought this accessory for my 2-year-old son Sam, and he loves everything about it except the fact that there is not quite enough top clearance for trains to pass underneath -- You have to set the spans on blocks for that. I also agree that the set should include the ascending track, or at least a notice that it's sold separately."
5,Fun and sturdy bridge,"I have three boys ages 12,6,and 2 and a half. All three boys enjoy playing together with there many Thomas pieces. This bridge stays together and can be used as a small bridge or both pieces as a large bridge without the two year old knocking it down easily. It makes building a more complicated track fun for the 12 year old without his younger brothers messing it up. A great addition to any set."
4,Brilliant Satiric Britpop,"If you can get hold of the box set of Different Class, do it! The other CD in the box Second Class is even better than the main CD.And this IS good stuff. The happy way in which Pulp sings about tragic comic situations of everyday life makes you join in singing, but it also makes you think. After all, life's worth living."
5,Brilliant,"Stunning, insightful, touching.... this is a great read. You get ""trapped"" by the dialogue - which is - to paraphrase ""genius"". Allegory, yes - I don't get the ""slavery element"" others find in it - far too superficial -- it seems to me more about relationships - and living. Buy it!"
3,pivot point,I read the revue and thought this is the replacement for me as I had broken the pivot screw in my very old delta miter with a mishap on the band saw. I have had it a while and really thought it was great until 1/22/ 06 when I used the hold down feature and realized the gauge was lifting off the pivot. The old pivot was a special tapered screw which held it together. Maybe it is just me But when using the miter on a router table the work needs to be secure. So I will not use this one as a hold down. Other than that it is very accurate.I wonder why R Fesser did not have this problem
4,"Very good miter gauge, except ...","I bought this to replace the crappy one that came with my DeWalt DW745, whose pivot pin had sheared off during a little mishap. The Delta miter gauge has a little washer at the bottom of the guide that rides in the T-track and keeps the gauge from tipping out. It's a great feature if your saw supports it. Mine doesn't, so I needed to remove it. There's just a Phillips-head screw holding it in but unfortunately, as one of the other reviewers said, it's virtually impossible to remove. I ended up having to drill out the screw. Also, as mentioned by this same other reviewer, I discovered that there were no holes in the miter head for attaching an extension fence, even though the instruction sheet states that there are. So I will have to drill those myself.Once I got these issues sorted out, the miter gauge worked great. It should have been more painless though."
2,Not what I was expecting,As far as the price of the shoe goes it does not fit the poor quality of it's build. I was looking forward to receiving this pair of shoes in the mail believing for the price I paid they would be top quality and ended up disappointed before I even tried them on. The velcro on the side of the shoes is not fully sown on which will cause them to fall apart much sooner than they ever should. I also received the order with no return label or order slip. Nothing was sent to me to indicate that I would be allowed to send them back and get a refund.It's pretty difficult to disappoint me and this order all around had nothing about it that was positive except the timely fashion I received it in.
1,Repeat,I thought thatit would be different. If you have Knitter's magazine then you have a lot of these stories. I like reading her part in the magazine but it is a shame that I paid for the book when I already have the magazines.
4,The First Frost,"This is the first book of the Inspector Frost series, and it might well have been the last if Wingfield had killed him off as he originally intended. I have watched the entire set of A Touch of Frost on DVD and grew to love the characters so much that I thought I'd try reading the books on which the series was based. The book does not disappoint.At first, we experience Jack Frost only through the eyes of others. It is great fun, especially because we know that Frost is a good detective despite all evidence to the contrary. Only later do we get glimpses of Jack's thoughts.One satisfying element is that Frost's plate is full. He has many mysteries to solve, including finding out who's been filching coins from his desk, and why is someone ineptly trying to break into a bank every night?I look forward to reading more books in the series."
2,Something of a mess . . .,"If you came to this book from the television series derived from Wingfield's books, brace yourself for a shock. The plot is messy, the characters rather sketchy at times, and Frost himself, far from being the amiable, sharp-tounged fellow embodied by David Jason, is a dirty-minded, insensitive, self-centered pig, the sort of fellow who puts the move on a missing child's mother when he discovers she is a part-time prostitute.There are also conincidences in the book, particularly a minor character that links both of the mysteries unfolding in the story, that stretch plausibility close to the breaking point. But there were obviously possibilities in both the story and the characters, possibilities that were realized much more fully when this novel reached television in the first TOF series in an episode entitled ""Care and Protection."""
2,Good Ideas that Don't Take Off,"An ambitious book that ultimately bites off more then it can chew. Could the author be too much of a brainiac? There are lovely moments of texture and real insight, and then long insufferable passages where the author's strain is evident. A series of vignettes meant to expose the shameful secrets of the main characters fail because the secrets aren't, well, that shameful. The rivalry between the two sisters ends up repeating the same note over and over, squabbling leading to more squabbling. Nonetheless, the cumulative effect of the novel somehow does manage to land. The author does seem to have caught a side ways glace of much of what ails us, and the feeling you are left with at the end (an uneasy and ephemeral melancholy) may or may not be worth the read - it depends on your patience."
1,A waste of great talent,"While the author shows outstanding writing potential, style, and use of language, this book failed to showcase that in a way that will propel her to future fame. This book is incredibly difficult to follow and does not flow in a way that makes the reader want to try to follow along with where this story is going. I am not one to give up easily on a book, especially from a writer with such potential, but this book was too much even for me; after only 70 pages, I was ready to throw the book in trash. This seems to be an example of a great writer forcing a story about NOTHING. I hope to see her produce some notable pieces of literature in the future."
4,The Effect of Being Propelled Through Fictional Space,"The prose zings, the narrative soars: this is Julavits at her best. Like with everything great, there's one problem: the interwoven, short chapters narrated by ancillary characters don't measure up to the rest of the novel, but that's a small complaint. Novels like this just aren't published often enough. If you care about what's going on in the post-al Qaeda world, if you want a primer on how to keep on keepin' on post-9/11, EFFECT is your book. And Julavits is your savior."
1,What Was The Point?,"This is the worst book I've ever read. Rather, tried to read. I didn't even get past the first two chapters. I skimmed through the rest of the book then I threw it out. I didn't feel it was even worth passing onto someone else. The book was just full of garbage writing to put it simply and I couldn't make sense of anything. I do not recommend this book unless you enjoy wasting money."
2,"Funny, but doesn't ring true","I couldn't decide whether this is meant to be a witty novel or a satirical account of our response to 9/11. Because much of Heidi Julavitis's novel is too ridiculous to be simply a witty story, I eventually plunked with satire. This is problematic: for satire to work it must keep the same tone throughout. Not so here--some of the characters in this book ring true, others are outlandish. I'm sure she'd argue it differs from simple slapstick in that it take on ""big"" ideas. Fine, but the story can't carry their weight."
1,(...),"what a messy, mess, mess this book is!there's a/are terrorist(s) on board a plane- but the reader is let in on the beginning that the terrorism isn't real- in fact there's some strange school where people are trained to act out fake terrorist attacks-- for what purpose? who knows.oh, the narrator hints at this & that- the author lets us into the other passenger's minds briefly in these small interjected chapters- why? once again, who knows?you really never know what the heck is going on- people die- but do they really? relationships take on a joking manner that only the author seems privvy to. oh my gosh! the only reason i finished the darn thing was due to a (wrong) belief that all of the confused nonsense would work itself out in the end.do yourself a favor & don't bother with this book."
3,"wonderful writing, eh story","I was very excited as I began this book-- there's no question that Julavits can turn a phrase in a way that many writers, including myself, will envy! One description of sleeping huddled in a school cot under a blanket that hovered several inches above her ""like a benificent mold"" really got my attention... sounded like every institutional (camp, school) bed I'd ever been in.However, after awhile the cleverness overhwhelmed the plot. I liked the narrator, but the hijacking memory goes on so long, and the conditions are so bleak/gross, that it's like being trapped there yourself (a description of some particularly awful food was sort of like cruelty to the reader). Ultimately this kind of quirky, clever plotting became too tiresome and I lost the thread of the meaning and the larger significance.Should Julavits try something a little more conventional though I'd be there in a heartbeat. Definitely a writer to watch!"
4,whimsical,I really enjoyed this book. I love being able to get lost while reading. not a multitasking book! which may be why some people couldnt see into it. really stimulating.
1,Waste of Paper,"Holy crap, this was truly one of the worst books I have ever read. Yes, she can write, unfortunately she is writing about NOTHING. There is no point to anything that happens in this book.I love and respect books, and always pass them on, but this is the first one I actually TOSSED INTO THE GARBAGE after finishing. No one should be subjected to this trash book.Huge waste of my time."
4,Swiss Gear Self Inflating Mat,This item is made of a nice material. It is easy to inflate and do not slip in the floor.
1,Does not last; No customer service,"I hope my experience helps you avoid the costly buyer's remorse I experienced.The visual appearance is good - it appears to be more substantial than the average Made in China air mattress. It was not really ""Self Inflating,"" since you must blow some air into it to inflate. Still, that would be OK with me if the product worked.My 95-pound daughter used this just four times, all indoors. The bottom seam separated on the fourth night. I do not mean that any pinhole leaks developed - rather, the bottom seam/junction just separated. And, you can see that for inches on either side of the hole that the seam is beginning to loosen there as well.Emails to customer service went unanswered for either warranty support or even repair instructions.No matter what the price you pay, this mattress seems unlikely to last long enough to give value. And, customer service is non-existent."
1,lasted 3 weeks,I bought this with High hopes. Used it 3 weeks on a cot and the sides split when I contacted the company - too bad too sad can't help you. So much for quality and the we stand behind our products.
1,NO-SLEEP MAT,"This is a true torture mat. I was always so happy with Swiss Gear products, but this time they blew it. You won't be able to sleep on it. The only use I can find for it is sitting, but definitely no sleeping."
4,product review,"Great product, very nice! This is a very nice product, with good quailty material. If you need comfort I recommend this product."
5,pleased as punch,"I purchased this product a few years ago & I have replaced the batteries a # of times, it has been dropped numerous times. The screen was so bad you could hardly read it. The local store I purchased it at has not had it again so I could replace it. I finally got online just to see if I could find a game comprable to this one and low and behold I found the same one! Thanks so much having it for me to find."
1,disappointed.,"I have had a former radica solitaire game, that I loved, and this one just does not come up to it...I hope a new version, that a person can see better, and has a better Vegas solitaire...will come onto the market...Thank you, I had much fun with the old version.."
1,Not even worth $3.99,"This toy failed to work after less than a dozen games of solitaire. You'd spend less per game at an arcade. In addition, the visual difference between the 'spade' and 'clubs' suits is virtually zero, and it's also hard to quickly distinguish all suits in general. My previous solitaire game (which lasted for many years) had the 'red' suits in outline, which made distinguishing suits very easy. Also, this game is very slow at dealing out each hand from the deck. All in all a very frustrating playing experience. I'm almost glad it broke so I can move on to another machine. Avoid this toy - it's NOT WORTH IT at any price."
3,"flip top solitaire game, radica, used",uses AAA batteries but only two and they wear out quickly. The back light is poor and wears out the batteries. I don't recommend this game for heavy users. They made a flip top with 4 batteries that was a lot better.
1,It's obvious all the talent was BEHIND the lead singer in VAMP,"I loved the Transvision Vamp albums, they were derivative but fun. Wendy's first solo album had a few fun songs as well, despite being one colossal joke at her expense. Then after a long silence Wendy James gives us....THIS? A truly wretched excuse for an album...anyone expecting a ""hidden gem"" or ""unappreciated classic"" will be rightfully shocked. Make no mistake, this CD is achingly, painfully, maddeningly, jaw-droppingly awful. Not a guilty pleasure, or so bad it's good, but simply unlistenable.Anyone rating this CD higher than one star, must clearly be poor Wendy James, logged onto Amazon, under an assumed name."
5,Beautifully done. A prayer book and coffe table book in one!,"The authors have done a wonderful job taking the mystery out of Novenas and prayers. This book would make a wonderful gift for those searching for spirituality. The prayers work, I know this from personal experience. I've purchase several copies to give as gifts this coming Christmas."
4,Good book but...,"All in all this book is very good but I did find one discrepancy for sure--The picture used for St. Catherine of Siena is actually St. Catherine of Alexandria's picture, which is my Patron Saint being a new RCIA convert. That has been the only disappointing thing about the book at this point. I would have thought the authors would have been more in tune with the different St. Catherine's to have caught this before publishing this book."
5,These Novenas really work!,"I prayed one of these Novenas to the Blessed Mother last year when I was in a great deal of trouble, and I received the answer I was looking for after only 2 days (instead of 9)!! So these really work, and I bet they even work for people who are not Catholic (although I am) because all you have to do is believe! :)"
4,"""The Power of Prayer,"" Indeed","This is a beautiful book. The sections on the Infant of Prague, the Mother of Sorrows, and Our Lady of Mount Carmel are especially valuable. One mistake, however: The picture of Saint Catherine in the section on Saint Catherine of Siena is of Saint Catherine of Alexandria, not Saint Catherine of Siena."
1,Totally unpleased,"I recieved the dvd, put it in the dvd player and It would not register. I thought is was a blank dvd, to my surprise the dvd was damaged. It had a crack in it. So that was a lost of money."
2,Miss Cintinential Pagent,This was not what I thought it was going to be. I had heard that it was entertaining and that was not the case. I could not sit through the whole thing. It was just that bad.
1,Does not fit 2005 Suzuki Forenza. Box says Chevy,"I used the Amazon drop down menus to select 2005 Suzuki Forenza S.It came up compatible but the bolts do not fit and the box says for Chevy.My mechanic called the manufacturer Fel-Pro who says the correct part number is ES72906-1.Amazon, please correct this. The head bolts will fit something, but not a 2005 Suzuki Forenza.Bolts were in a sealed plastic bag with air holes and were rusty."
5,Most spectacular piece of literature ever written,"This book was like an adventure to me and I would definitely suggest those who enjoy this type of story base to buy and read it! This has been my favorite book for a long time now, nothing can surpass it. Tala has a strong personality resulting in a perfect complex role aside the domineering Viking. Must read for anyone who enjoys fantasy, medieval, vikings, or just a strong romance."
1,Worked as described...only on the first time!,"I purchased the Bissell Flop-It Select Hard Floor Cleaner with Heat (7340) about half a year ago to clean my hardwood floors throughout my home. The product worked well the first time I used the product...but I wanted to write the review after a couple of uses. The product does not do any one thing well. The vacuum portion is weak and the ""wet"" side does not work very well. The spray jets on my unit is clogged and does not release any solution (thus making the ""wet"" part useless). Now when I use the product, I take out my other vacuum to sweep up the floor. I then spay my own wood cleaner on the floor and then wipe up the floor with the Bissel Flip-It. It seems rather redundant process. I would not recommend this product."
1,disappointing,This cleaner is not very maneuverable and is very noisy. It leaves streaks from the rubber squeegee on the floor. The vacuum option is not an option as the range for the suction is limited to the dirt directly aligned with the entry hole - otherwise the dirt is pushed along or missed. My standard vacuum and an electronic steam mop (with micro fiber pads) was a much better solution. I apply a floor cleaner from a misting/squirt bottle where needed.
1,Doesn't suck...,"It literally doesn't suck like a vacuum should. The vacuum is very weak. The literature says it's good for dust and crumbs. If you need to suck up anything more than that, like pet hair, you need more vacuum. The wet mop works okay, until you turn it off. Then it becomes a dripping mess. We had to set the thing outside after use to let it drip dry. This is more of a novelty item than an appliance."
3,Cleans very well but has cons,"I was impressed with the cleaning and I loved the hot water option.It has a problem standing up right, if you dont get it just right, down it goes.Suction is so so, I have seen better."
2,look for better product,"I was looking for a vacuum that can do all the job. I was so tired of doing the same old type of cleaning at my apt's hardwood floor, since nobody cleans except me I was expecting that this would lessens the job. But I MADE A HUGE MISTAKE of buying this product. At first, It was ok. A little bit hard to push forward when you are using the wet vacuum side and the floor is not that wet. And it has the worst vacuum suctioning that I've ever seen.You need to use another vacuum that would do a good suction on the dirts on the floor.And when your doing the suction for the wet vacuum the water leaks on the sides. So It's really a waste of time and money when you buy this product. I sent it back for my refund. I should have trusted the comments before I decided to buy this product. It's really not worth it."
3,It's okay,I got this for my mom as a birthday gift to help her clean her floors. She says she doesn't like how often you have to change the pad to clean the floor. I'm sure it works fine. She was just expecting something that does it all.
2,Junky and performs poorly,Does a poor job of cleaning floors and is not worth the price.It's a mess to add liquids and a pain to clean the unit.After the first use my wife complained about the product. After the second use she put it in the closet and there it remains.She now grabs and inexpensive old-fashioned sponge-mop and gets the cleaning job done in minutes.
2,Bummed,"I purchased this item for my laminate floors as we have laminate throughout for the purpose of a wheelchair. The idea of being able to vac and then wash was great and thought it would be easier on my back than a mop. I found this to be true. The issue with it standing upright I found to be true as indicated in a previous review. Most importantly though, the trigger that lets the solution out onto the floor died after a month.The closest place that handles their product warranties is 45 minutes away from us (and I live in a big city). In addition, the place that does handle the warranties told me this problem is common with this product. Needless to say, I opted not to get this fixed and am out the money I spent on the product. The hassle of carting it 45 mins. to have to go back again to pick it up when done brings me to a total of 3 hours on the road with no guarantee that the next trigger will be any better."
1,Worst cleaning product ever purchased,"Before I purchased this product, I read several reviews, many of them very favorable. This product was also recommended by the grout cleaning/restoring company I recently used for my tile floors. Imagine my surprise and disappoinment when I discovered how utterly useless this product actually is. It does a very uneven job of distributing the cleaning solution onto the floor, and an even worse job of sucking it back up, leaving many puddles of dirty solution over the entire floor. I literally have to remop the entire floor every time I use it. I've tried other Bissel products which were fine, but this one is an expensive dud. Don't waste your money"
2,Limits,"I am disabled, recently my husband died. Since he was the floor guy, I thought I would try to find an ""assistant"". After much research I choose this unit.It does not live up to my hopes. The water output and suction leave much to be desired. Too little on both ends. I also find I have to remove the cleaning pad often to rinse, in the middle of the job. Granted I live in puppy piddleville, and in that regard it's a whole lot better than paper towels and spray. But I wish I hadn't spent the money. A mop and bucket do the same job."
4,Pretty Good product,"This product is pretty good for floor cleaning. It does not come with much cleaner so make sure to order or buy a bottle of the type you need. The only drawback is there are no rotating scrubbers when it uses the wet cleaner side. I have a friend with a different brand whos has the scrubbers and she says it picks up a lot. On the plyus side it is great to never have to whip out the old broom, dust pan and mop!"
2,Buyer beware!,"Loved the mop, the results were great (no streaks). It is tough to push but its really drying the floor. However, it only worked 2x - won't dispense the fluid. Past 30 days so can't return or exchange and repair shop is 90 min away. I now use it to dry the floors, no bang for the buck here. There are better steam mops, skip this one."
3,"Cleans well, but smells terrible","I like the fact that I can vacuum up any mess. And it cleans the floor pretty well. However, you must never leave it setting after you clean your floors. It will smell to high heaven the next morning. Even if you do clean it after every use, I still find that the unit itself just smells bad. Not ideal for spot cleaning. I'm getting a swiffer for little messes."
5,"Love, LOVE, LOVE IT!","This product is definitely worth the money. The first time I used it, I knew I would never go back to the old mop and bucket. It saved my back, time, and a whole lot of sweating. I have a NYC apartment that is all wood floors. With our extra many legged ""tenants"", I knew I wanted something that would really clean my floors so that I had piece of mind while my boys played on the floors. I was sooooo impressed with the amount of dirt and grime that this machine sucked up. All i can say is YAHOO! Buy it, you won't be sorry."
1,Save your money,"Very little to no suction on the dry side. Wet side had good suction but difficult to push forward making the task more difficult. Sprayer stopped working after just 2 uses. Since I hate repackaging for returns, the unit is sitting unused in a corner. I thought I had found the perfect lightweight cleaner but I am still searching."
5,racing in his dreams,"my son loves this bed. it took him a couple of weeks to get used to it but now he even polishes his ""car"". it's fun and makes that transition a lot easier."
2,Nice bed for a child who loves cars!,"My son will love this bed. It comes in a really big box, though, so be prepared. Be very careful taking out the stickers. They are taped to the inside of a second box inside the first one. Mine were actually stuck to the box. I've contacted Little Tikes but haven't had any luck yet getting them replaced. I've been saving the bed in hopes of surprising him with the completed bed. It's been three weeks and still nothing. That's the only reason I didn't rate this bed higher."
5,MY 4 YEAR OLD LOVES IT!!!,I had bought this bed for my son when he was almost 3 and now he is almost 5 and still absolutely loves his Lightning McQueen big boy twin bed!
4,my son loves this one.,"This furniture is great for my son, but kinda of hard work for papa, especially for the sticking work, cost me one hour and finally not so perfect on it, :(."
4,Great Transitional Bed,My son loves this bed and it made the transition from the crib a breeze. The stickers are a bit tricky and at 22 months old my son had fun ripping them off after I spent so much time putting them on.
4,Lightning McQueen twin bed,"My 2 year old son loves this bed!! We did have to put a board on the bottom, but only because we did not put a box spring so the side of the car can be his bumpers. Highly recommend. Easy to put together, however the stickers took more time to put on....but adds a really nice touch."
5,"What a great bed for ""Cars"" fans!","We got this bed for my son when he was 2 1/2. The look on his face when he saw it all put together, priceless! A year later he still loves it!We have moved this bed several times. It's very easy to take apart and put back together. The only thing that doesn't hold up are the stickers, especially with little fingers picking at them.If your little guy moves around a lot, do like we did, only put in a mattress and forgo the box spring. It's like having built in bed rails."
5,Fun and durable,"My husband and I decided to purchase this car bed for our then 2year old son so we could have bed to ourselves again. Well, when it arrived my son was soooo excited to sleep on it that we didn't have to work hard to get him to sleep on it that nite. Very durable, but I recommend using a large plywood to put underneath the mattress for support. The stickers were fun but also tricky. Looks almost exactly like the real Lighting McQueen. Overall, my son and I are very happy!"
3,"Average, not great","At over $100 this is an expensive book. It has some good information, being useful for Modules 1& 2 of the National Association of Purchasing Managers (NAPM) exams but is quite repetitive in its jargon. Much of what is discussed is generally known by anyone with any significant work experience. More calculations and hard data might be helpful. The book itself is of rugged construction and well made and of convenient size for portable reading."
2,"Dated text, repetetive material","This book is required for one of my college supply chain courses, and I found it to be very dated. The chapters repeat the same things over and over again, and don't add much of anything new. My professor is great, but this text is not."
4,like it,This is fun to have and I didn't pick season 4 for any paticular reason. I just wanted to have some flintstone cartoons in the house to share with my grandchildren.
4,Timeless cartoon,"A page from my childhood. I remember when the serries was broadcast at night. I know that its been said over and over again but, they don't make 'em like this any more."
5,Excellent DVD of classic cartoon,"I'm from the period when they showed ""The Flintstones"" heavily on local TV stations between 1978 and 1983. They really were a hit with kids that period too(myself too back then) , just like in the 60s. Has anyone ever noticed how they would take popular places like Hollywood, Las Vegas and others and add a Rock or Stone to the title on that show? It's like taking a Stone Age approach to everyday products we use. Even an elephant for a vacuum cleaner had me laughing! They had to have been heavily influenced by The Honeymooners, because the Ralph Kramden screams and rants are heavily heard in Fred Flintstone. The show was always funny, the interaction between Fred and Barney Rubble all very common and with the wives of Wilma and Betty. A classic cartoon that will appeal to anyone or anybody!"
1,Spanish Audio Track?,"For those who already bought this DVD set... Does it have, or not, the Spanish Audio Track?If you please comment in this matter, it would be very apreciated"
3,Fair but could be great,"This simply... Jack Johnson meets Maroon 5. Sadly, its not the best of either. Fair music, but no punch to it. Unique vocals, but no special song or strength behind it. I think in a couple CD's Kailai will finally bloom."
5,Talented and Original,"Kalai has a sound that is equally unique and thoroughly enjoyable. Great lyrics, acoustics, and smooth voice with great range. His music just has a ""soul"" that words can't fully describe. How he hasn't had more success is beyond me. As much as I like Amos Lee, Ben Harper, and Jack Johnson, Kalai is better than them all. Highly recommended!"
4,A Musical Must,"Kalai weaves poetic lyrics into masterful music. I highly recommend a listen to Crows Feet. If you are a John Butler Trio or Ben Harper fan, you owe it to yourself to listen to Kalai. You should be hooked from the start of 'september' or try 'waiting for my blue sky'...also check out his other discs. All vary in style a bit and deserve an ear."
2,Different,"I have this album as well as the Acoustiscm album. Love that one. Not this one. Crows feet is just so....cheesy. Poppy. I mean, talent - yes. Passion - yep. But....there were moments...ouuus and ahhhs and or chord progressions or the way an instrument was played that just made me cringe. Not to mention how starkly different this album is from the other. If you love Acoustisim, maybe download a song or two from this album before you buy it."
5,this is a great anime,This seires will please yaoi fangirls and its a really great drama and comedy i still think they should give this seires a chance for a english dub cast.
5,AWSOME!!!!,"Completely in my opinion,THIS IS AWSOME!! It even got my straight cousin ( who is a boy ) to get obsessed with the anime.He is only interested in the first couple/Romantica though.Im obsessed with the second couple/Egoist. I luv I luv I luv it!!! It was totally worth the money! I'm glad I got this on my birthday. This is recommended by people who at least like Yaoi,Love sad parts from time to time,and can take on the love of boys!!! Totally worth it so I'm gonna get the second season pack YAY!"
3,dvd is lacking,i am a fan and have been for a long time. i do enjoy owning them on dvd but the dvd lacks a lot. could use more special features and i would have enjoyed a box set much more. too bad amazon and a lot of places dont carry these dvds anymore because i know of lots of people looking for them and they are envious of my small stack that keeps growing among my collection of dvds.
4,Very Informative,"This book was very informative, it gave all the information I needed for my research on foreign policy about satellites. It also gave information on just about everything in spying. It talked about the first spies, and their devices they used (robofly). It also talked about some of the most famous spies like James Ames, and what they did to become known for what they did. And the author talks about how spying can be a very useful tool to keep peace in the world, and how it will keep foreign affairs nice and tidy, although personally I feel spying just shows that you don't trust the person / people that you're spying on. Overall I think it was a greatly written, very informative selection."
1,"Doesn't work, no support","I bought this and installed it, along with the drivers (which I had to download from the AVerMedia site; no CD was supplied). No go. I called AVermedia and was dumped into voicemail, and never got a call back. I then called the vendor, Newegg, and they refused to help me outside of RMA'ing the product.So, in short, it doesn't work, and no one I've spoken to or tried to speak to seems to both not know what's wrong, or willing to investigate. My system is Vista ""Ultimate,"" on an Nvidia motherboard; I suspect this card isn't supported on either Vista or a non-Intel board. It would have been nice if the documentation on the site noted either.I have an old AVerMedia card, maybe 6 years back, and I was happy with it. But I'm disappointed in their support, or lack there-of, and with the vendor from whom I purchased it. I'll RMA the board. In a nutshell, this is probably a good card, but you have to have the right combination of OS and motherboard for it to be recognized and work."
1,Prayers that Heal the Heart,"The Author wrote this book to make money, not to help people. If he was honest he would be healing hundreds of people a day. Does anyone know anyone he has healed or his process has healed?"
4,What a blessing!,"A person may have a general knowledge of this Biblical information, but this book takes you step by step for complete spiritual release. It will be a blessing to you."
4,What makes John Flomer better than most ?,"Musicality. John Flomer's music stresses melody and rhythm in a genre (New Age) where these musical elements are largely ignored in favor of 'ambience'. Like the previous reviewer, I also have his first cd (called 'One') which I actually like better than this one. A true craftsman."
5,Revolutionary!!,This album touched my soul...as a member of Rhema Christian Center; I recommend this album to all Christians no matter where you are in your walk with the Lord. The word has a way of finding you where you're at in life. Don't let this RHEMA word pass you by. May God be glorified!!!
5,Truly an experience!,"My friend told me this was her favorite CD and she's an awesome musician and singer, so I checked them out. They were so on point it was ridiculous! The music is stellar and the vocals are off the hook! If you want to experience one of the best p&w CDs out there, you must get this one. I know it's from 2006, but I just discovered it and am glad I did!"
3,Misrepresented Product,The CD is wonderful but it is not what I actually thought it would be. The item was basically trickery since there isn't the little girl I wanted to listen to.
5,Best gift ever!,"I bought this in PINK for my big brother. It was the ""gag"" half of a gift - I also picked him up S&Son; Season 1 on dvd. Turns out - he loved the tshirt more than any other gifts! He gets to display to the world that he's got the attitude of Fred Sanford. Lovely!A conversation piece - it also brings shouts of ""I'm comin' Elizabeth!"" and ""This is the big one!"". If you know anyone who has ever watched and loved Sanford & Son - you MUST order this.High quality, super soft cotton, screen printed image, it shipped clean and wrapped - and very quickly."
2,"Questionable taste, unskilled movie making, low budget","I felt the movie had some positive aspects, however I felt the acting was not very skilled and the overall quality was poor.Some of the scenes appeared to me to be in poor taste and the vivid sex was in bad taste, no meaning to it. In fact none of the sex had a context or story line that lead up to it and it was without emotion such as love or any romance. This was a poor investment. I strongly support films that allow us to see from other perspectives and get an understanding of others as well as other ways of life, this did not show any real possitive side to the Gay life."
1,"Bad acting & dialogue, below average looking actors!","This movie makes anyone NOT WANT to be gay. I have seen a lot of very artsy, well made gay cinema.... Inserting full on sex scenes in the middle and at the end of the movie only cheapened the movie--cuz the actors are below average looking from head to toe... The acting is so helpless. So, if you're into bad cinematography, sound, music, dubbing, and so forth, this movie's for you. But spare yourself of the agony that I went through!"
2,not worth to buy it!,"I was very disappointed. this move is realy bad - bad actors, bad acted, bad story! it seems be maked by a private person with friends as ""actors"". there is no story, or I didn't find her... You always see this guys sitting in this bar an telling themself storys about their ""sex-lifes"" - and than you see this scenes. But these are bad too - realy, you won't see this gays naked... and you don't see very much! :-) Don`t buy it, there is no story, the guys are not very handsome and the acting is horror! Save your money, I better did it too!"
1,Awful,"Bad acting. Bad story. Bad production. One of the worst movies I have ever seen. If I could give it zero or less, I would. It is from the same people who did Murder in Portland which is also very bad."
5,cd single,this is the single for the song vicarious. i have no idea why this person is selling it for 300 dollars. MAYBE if it was signed. Maybe.. but I got this same cd on ebay for 3 dollars and 50 cents a few days ago. anyway its only the 1 track single. cool to have but not a big deal.
3,Awesome Movie!,"God Is My Co-Pilot is an amazing movie. There's no knockin of this film. My problem with the dvd is that Warner Brothers made it so that it can only play on certain dvd players. It won't play on any dvd player that has a record option, or on any pc/mac or game system. If I were to buy it again, I'd get a VHS."
1,paid and didnt receive,ordered this product in good faith-never recd this product or notified why it didnt ship.this experience left a bad tast in my mouth. amazon should be ashamed to allow nothingbutnet to handle any orders to amazona very disappointed customerjim hemphill
1,God is My C0-Pilot,The picture quality was very poor. The picture showed as very dark on screen. Unable to make any adjustment.
1,DO NOT WATCH THIS IF YOU READ THE BOOK!,"I am a great fan of Robert L. Scott and have read his book a million times. However, if you want a movie that is historically accurate or follows the book this movie is from a definite Hollywood viewpoint being biased against Chenault and showing Scott as this sychotic, atheist freak who finally comes to a belief in some kind of god. Which to anyone who reads the book is complete nonsense."
1,major rip off,What a waste. Can't believe they duped me on this one.Worthless documentation. They sent me the getting started guide for $$.
1,Understanding ArcSDE,Save your money. You can find better information for free on the internet. As soon as I opened the package I decided to return the book.
4,Although it's a poor French comedy...,"I like it because it's so silly. I also waited for this DVD release for so many years because the theme song ""L'evenement Le Plus Important Depuis Que L'homme A Marche Sur La Lune"" by Mireille Mathieu is a great song, but it's never released on any of her CDs. I hope that the film and soundtrack will be remastered."
1,A career low point for all parties concerned.,"I saw this movie around 20 years ago and it was easily the worst movie Deneuve, Mastrionni, or Demy ever did. It's excruciating to watch."
5,Great CD,"Like all their CD's 22 brides has great vocals and harmonies on this one. If you're anywhere near Hartford CT, go see Carrie Johnson (Half of 22 brides) live. She is a great performer and has a great solo CD called Geograpical Fix. E-mail ttbrides @hotmail.com for performance schedule and CD's."
3,Solid but not airtight,"Found this to be a much better product than the typical plastic one you find, it is far from airtight when closed."
2,Not a History of the F-105,"This book is NOT a history of the F-105. There are no stories about the aircraft except for a paragraph under each black and white photo. There are no color photos and the black and white photos are of marginal quality. There is not much in the way of the history of the Thud save for the first few pages. The F-105 deserves better. It is however, nice to know what has happened to the surviving aircraft. The histories of these survivors are in a type of outline form and not a story form. This book is not readable. I finished the reading material in less than an hour. Too bad."
4,An great addition for the Thomas Fan,"We bought the Barrel Loader for our 2-year-old son for Christmas and it has easily become a staple in our track creations. While he still has more fun just putting every single one of his engines together and racing them around the track, every once in a while he does like to stop and use the barrel loader. This piece is great because it is independent of the tracks and it has the added bonus of teaching a little bit about cause-and-effect (you push down on the read lever and the barrel rolls out)."
4,Fun Toy,i have this toy and i think it's fun!. i Like the way the barrells roll there are corn flour and molasses barrells.
2,No Longer Lifetime Warranty,"Beware. Per the Learning Curve website and customer service phone rep, Thomas Products now have a 90 day limited warranty rather than a lifetime warranty.""Our products are guaranteed for 90 days from date of purchase under normal and intended use and service against defective workmanship and material. If our product fails to meet our limited warranty during the warranty period, we will, at our option, replace the product free of charge, or provide you with a replacement of comparable value"""
4,A Very Helpful Guide,"I have been a Tomb Raider fan from the 1st PS1 game I bought.Thankfully,there are guides to help players like me through the game(I'm NO gamer).Since this a PS2 game,I need more help than ever! This colrful guide book has really helped me play the game as well as I can the PS1."
4,"Not quite ""Comeplete""","The guide does a wonderful job of taking you through the game as well as giving you the 'secret' object locations. I would have given it a 4.5/5 if that were on option. There are some things that you must read in the game manual (the biggest one is to use the ""grip"" button (E on the PC version) when Lara does not have a strong grip on a ledge...if you do not you fall...always). The book shows the moves in the PS2/Xbox controls and not the PC (generally speaking). No question about it though I had used the guide in a few spots to continue the game."
4,solid release,I am a huge kokane fan and have heard most of his work.Even though this album is a group effort and not a kokane solo it is legit and at least worth a listen.
3,"Beautiful Music, poor recording quality","I'm rather new to enjoying opera, so I can't provide an in depth review as the other knowledgable reviewers. However, I do have a large music collection (including live recordings) and was very disappointed in the quality of the recording. It sounds as if it was recording from a television program; and not one with a very good sound system. I plan on purchasing a different recording as the music is too beautiful to listen to as recorded on this disc."
4,Good Walkthrough,"This guide covers all aspects of the game. It has maps of all pertinent locations. It explains in detail what is needed in order to complete each mission. The reason this guide didn't recieve 5 stars is because it's a bit confusing when it comes to playing the ""rescue buddy"" missions. If it's a buddy a different character would originally start out rescuing I find that it's hard to descover the specific location for the misson not to mention getting there."
3,Far Cry Instincts,The Guide was very helpful. It really let me understand the game better. It was worth the money.
4,"Leather CD, DVD storage","This is as good product. The leather is excellent. If I were manufacturing this item,I would come up with a better closure than snaps. I'm afraid the snaps could damage the CDs."
1,Lack of Facts Sinks Book,"Given the suthor's impressive academic credientials I was appalled at how badly done this book is done. Time and time again the author gets crucial facts wrong even in cases where the original sources cited get it right. In addition to the errors listed in the previous review the author identifies 17 year old Starkweather victim Robert Jensen as 16 year old victim Carol King's father, identifies the two youngest victims of the Clutter massacre the inspired In Cold Blood as being two girls when in fact it was a girl and a boy and myriad similar errors that completely undercuts the authors credibility and renders this work untterly unreliable and worthless as a reference resource. If the reader is interested in a book that really delivers what this one purports to attempt then I would highly reccomend Colin Wilson's briiliant and accurate ""Criminal History of Mankind."""
2,More Inaccuracies,"In addition to what has already been reported, there are other problems. ""Edward"" Kemper, the serial killer, is actually Edmund Emil Kemper III. This was the first time that I've read that the woman who committed suicide after being raped by KKK leader Stephenson was a KKK employee; all other books indicate that she was a state employee. Similarly, the lane on which the Hall-Mills murders took place has always been referred to as DeRussey's Lane; I've never seen it called ""Phillips Lane"". If the author's statement- that the editors added this material without her knowledge- is true, then she needs new editors. In the meantime, this book should be read with caution by anyone not already familiar with the cases."
1,More inaccuracies,"Richard Trenton Chase is misspelled as Richard Tenton Chase. Diane Downs is misspelled as Diane Downes. In a particularly sloppy and disquieting factual error, Scott says that it is Downs' oldest daughter, Christie, who died after she and two siblings were shot by their mother; in actuality it was Downs' youngest daughter, Cheryl, who died. One wonders what the survivors of this tragedy would think of this error; hopefully, they never wasted their time with this book. And you shouldn't, either."
2,"A crime, indeed","This could have been a fascinating book: an overview of headline-making murders over the past 100 years. But Scott--though a good writer--has no grasp of history (or perhaps--let's be fair--her editor or fact-checker done her dirt). Just in the first couple of chapters alone, the book gets the date of a famous murder off by ten years, refers to the ""Ziegfield"" [sic] Follies, and has the song ""Good Ship Lollipop"" released in the 1920s. Plus, there are no photos! I'm not asking for grisly crime scene shots, but a few illustrations are really called for in a book such as this. All in all, a sad and shabby job."
1,How can one book contain so many mistakes?,"This author manages to relay amazing crime stories in such a dry fashion that it drains each story of all possible interest. In addition to the stunning number of factual errors pointed out by other reviewers below, I also noticed that the name of infamous spree killer Howard Unruh was spelled as ""Unrah""throughout the book. I can't believe that a book can contain so MANY very sloppy, careless errors and yet still get published. Don't waste your time and money on this one. If you're looking for a good encyclopedia on American crime try a book by Jay Robert Nash or Miriam Allen DeFord."
3,Big Fat and Average,"O.K. It could have been good... but they missed the mark. It has everthing... but it just doesn't hit the spot.... you know what I mean??buy it if you must, if you are bored...as I did.... or if you have too much money. Dummy.Actually Dummy is a better album... buy that one. by Portishead."
2,"Too ""safe"" of a mix for a real DJ...","I heard soundclips from this and other David Alvarado releases, at first listen they sound amazing, but if you want to hear the album in its entirety as a DJ should present it, then this does not make the cut. There was no evidence that it was mixed by a human being, too clean for my taste. DJ Spinna's mix of the Guidance catalogue is THE album to check to appreciate the Guidance sound."
4,"Fast paced, action packed with sexuality","Doc and Fluff is a very enjoyable read. If you are offended by violence and goddess spirituality then do not pick up this book. If you are looking for an exciting fictional tale full of sex, interesting characters, Harley motorcycles, adventure and a love story between two women, then you must read this book. This is a story mainly of Doc, an old fashion Dyke and her girlfriend Fluff, that hooks for a living. Both go on a wild ride adventure and both are changed in a postive way at the end of the tale. Pick up this book and pass it along to a friend."
2,Mumbo Jumbo (personality switches) and then some......,"I like to think I have an open mind about anything and sometimes that's a dangerous thing because some of us who truly believe we are open are in fact the most closed. All that withstanding on just the merits of a good storyline the book is mediocre. It's disjointed style makes it hard to stay interested. The main character of Doc is not given a soul for which we (the reader) should care about until the last few pages. Kind of late isn't it? Also Fluff, for all her bad and good virtures, miraculously becomes some sort of Angel that Doc just doesn't appreciate. Well I didn't appreciate the character switch. All the sex is violent so if you like that sort of thing have at it but to be honest I was expecting more than the few scenes doled out by Pat. I'll tell you that the sex was the least of this book's problems. If you just like futuristic hooey with a twist then read this book."
2,Just Doesn't Gel,"Bottom Line: Not a fusion, it's a jumble of different styles that just doesn't work on this CD. Pass on this CD but give any future efforts by this duo a chance.I am the first person to applaud for mixing genres of music - when it works. But just because you can put a techno loop with a hip-hop rap with a rock rift doesn't mean it sounds good. ""Human Condition"" shows that. It is not that these guys are without talent, some of the loops and rifts are quite catchy, such as on songs like ""Intro to Life,"" ""Human Condition,"" and ""Head Case."" There are glimmers of promise here (especially the song ""High Pursuit""), but otherwise it just plain doesn't gel. It sounds more like they were trying to throw together everything they think would be popular and hope somebody would find something to like. With a few exceptions this CD sounds very amateurish - like a kid in the basement plying with his new Acid loops. Maybe Ming and FS will get it together someday. Here's hoping."
5,"The Human Condition, something everyone can relate to...","This CD is remarkably diverse and demonstrates the versatility of these artists. Ming & FS have created a great album that combines their musical talents and producing skills. The music on the album ranges from two-step, to breaks, to drum & bass, to hip-hop, to a couple slower grooves. You can always hear the energy that these guys put into their music!"
4,I'm feelin' this; in terms'a movie scores is' a classic...,"After watching the movie (which is a classic!) an' noticin' Duke Ellington's name in the credits as havin' composed the score, I knew I hadda get my hands on this. I'm sumpin' of a jazz-head an' Ellington's compositions are straight from heaven, the stuff dreams are made of. Although I like his more relaxed stuff, this is some good big band arrangements; comin' outta that ""crime jazz"" vein like previous reviewers mentioned. It works best to me, because of the hint of danger behind even the more seductive an' playful pieces on the whole album.If you're jus' gettin' into the Duke's work, then this album should NOT be sumpin' you'd rush out an' get, but if you get deep enough into his work is' sumpin' of an essential. On the other hand, if you're a fan'a movie scores ('specially classix ones) then this IS sumpin' you'll wanna rush out an' get, 'cause is' a classic in that respects."
3,Great book - wish more read it,"Very good book interesting research, justifiable outrage. I wish however, it was written in a way that was more accessible to the average reader, this is such an important issue."
1,Don't give up on medicine,"Virtually every study published about adherence and the cost of medicines vs. doctors and hospitals show that life is improved and money is saved by intervening with appropriate care (often medicines) early.I felt sick reading this book. I felt like the author would assume I'd go for medicine given the ""illness"" I caught from reading. Basically, it's this kind of dramatic sexy title book that gets the masses pumped about a problem that does not exist.Why not focus on uninsured Americans - a study showed they have 6 times greater chance of death over a one year period."
5,Eye-opening & intelligent,"I am currently in Pharmacy school. I read this book because one of my instructors was reading it (for the second time) and he recommended it. It is absolutely true that many journal articles are skewed. Also, many of the health problems that we face can be ""treated"" with lifestyle changes, such as healthier diets and moderate exercise. After reading this book, I am even more convinced that I want to help encourage people to make the necessary changes to get off their medication if at all possible. I could go on, but I hope that more and more people will read this book carefully and talk to their doctor and/or pharmacist about it."
5,excellent,wonderful book. very well written. should be read by everyone. the pharmaceutical industry is helping to destroy this country and we all will be paying for this for a long time to come. hopefully the criminals who are running these companies will be made to pay the most.
5,A Sad Story,Read about the sad story of our American medicine which has been prostituted by the powers that be especially the criminal FDA
1,Great Idea!,I have had 4 of these all have failed within a year!!! Great Idea and it works great until it burns out.. Would avoid...Lamson wireless light.
3,Fun book,"I got this book because I wanted to learn Asian characters. But, my students, who know I love Japanese things, loved it too. I brought it into my class and gave the kids paint, brushes and paper and they made their own scrolls. It is sort of confusing and you really have to read through it to get the words/characters you want. I don't understand the order of the sections, but it didn't cost very much and I do get a lot of use out of it."
3,a little off,"I have the prior discs of Paul and Annie and love them and purchased this one with great anticipation. I can't put my finger on it, but this one dissappointed me slightly. In part its the style of the songs, a tad too old-timey and less pure blues. In part it is a forced feel to the whole thing.Its not horrible, but it just isnt great either."
5,"Not only great for leftovers, can also be used for storage.","First, I should explain that I keep kosher. What this means in practicality is that I use blue-lidded storage containers for dairy foods and red-lidded ones for meat foods.I like these containers because: 1. They seal well. 2. You can label what is inside on the tops and sides of the containers. 3. You can put them in the dishwasher. 4. They last a long time. 5. These Deep Dish containers can be used to store meals made ahead of time, large leftovers or food transportation. 6. You can freeze food in them easily. 7. You can also store non-food items in them, such as pencils, makeup, toys, etc. 8. You can use GladWare containers of different sizes to store ingredients for a dish one or two days before mixing/combining and cooking.Just a note: I didn't list these reasons in any order, I just wrote them as they popped into my head."
5,Turkey Leftovers,need new one for the holidays and they work great and I like that when my guest left I don't have to wait for my plates to come back
1,Terrible covers,"I waited two weeks before writing this review, hoping that I was somehow complicating a really simple thing. These containers just do not close. I have several other great GladWare products, but these are horrible. The covers on all three containers have never stayed closed and pop open on one or two corners within seconds of fitting it on the container.Now I'm just watching the waterline drop on the batch of soup I made as it slowly evaporates. One plus: The see-through plastic is great for that.It doesn't matter what's inside the container (solids, liquids, air -- either hot or cold). I have never microwaved them or put them in the dishwasher, the covers just wouldn't stay on the containers straight out of the box. I even have one container that has yet to be used and the lid still doesn't stay put. The lids fit well and are the right size, but the only way one will stay on is if I hold it down on two edges. Forever. What a life, eh?"
3,Tv type table,It is what I thought.... Was hoping quality would be better. Service was great. Style is perfect. Would buy it again...
2,not great,the quality was not very good it is not worthed $40. may be only $10.. i dont recommand it for this price
5,Table-Mate Woodgrain,"I have purchased two of these tables. I gave my first Table-Mate to my sister because I saw she really could use one. I ordered another because I found I really missed having my Table-Mate. It is very light and can be moved about so easily, plus it's a great size. I would not be without one!"
2,Table is wobbly and weak,It really looked good on TV and on line but is wobbles and is very weak and unstable. I do not recommend it.
5,love it,this is an inexpensive TV table to purchase. It is for our mother who eats at least one meal in her chair. It slides easily across the floor/carpet and fits her just right for eating her meal.Good quality and very stable.
1,Terrible Quality!!,I bought TWO of these tables. They were delivered about two weeks apart and BOTH of them were broken when I opened the box!! Terrible quality!! Cheap plastic!! Not sturdy!! Both of them wobble!! I would not recommend this product!!
4,Useful table,"Convenience little table for my laptop. Cheap material but serve the purpose. The table does tilt a little but it is fine once you have something sit on top of it. Would not recommend putting any heavy items or Hot liquid. The table is very light and might fall apart if holding too much weight. Overall, I would give it a 4 for the price and handy table."
2,Table Mate Portable Table,"serves it purposes, but very flimsy. Nothing like the original one I bought 5 years abo at Bed Bath and Beyond"
2,Too Flimsy to Use for Food and Beverage,"Planned to by a number of these, but bought two to try out. Easy to put together and folds up just fine, but if you put any pressure on the tray, it will bounce. The product would be fine if there was some way to brace the top. I do not intend to purchase any more of this product."
1,Piece of Junk,Plain and simple it's a piece of junk. While putting it together pieces that the leg bar was supposed to snap into snapped right off. It's very flimsy. Would never suggest any of my friends buy this one.
3,Flimsier than I'd hoped,"I wasn't exactly expecting a car lift here, but it's definitely more wobbly than I had expected. Serviceable, but certainly not ideal.Also, there's no retainer for the adjustment bar under the tabletop, so it falls loose if you don't hold onto it during adjustments. Still, it's reasonably priced and works for the essential features--adjusting, and sliding under a sofa (provided, of course, that your sofa stands on ""feet"" rather than a solid frame/base)."
5,Great for laptop,"I had a white Table-mate and my son wanted one for his laptop after using mine. Amazon had the best price and free shipping! Can't go wrong with this one. Only issue was the catch on the bottom was better on mine, don't know why the catch on his does not hold if you pick it up."
3,A utilitarian case for your treasures!,"This carry bag, although functional, could definitely stand some improvements. My 2-year old adores his wooden trains and requires us to bring them along wherever we go. My biggest beef with the product is the lack of dividers or any type of organization. Inside, there are a few pockets suitable for holding a few engines/cars, but otherwise the bag is just a flimsy, rectangular piece of plastic. It's great for just throwing some wooden track into and getting on your way, but it would be better if there were separate compartments for curved & straight track and maybe an accessory or two. I gave it three stars across the board, but we have not had it for very long so I cannot vouch for the product's durability.BOTTOM LINE: If you've got to have a Thomas bag for your trains & track that travel, this is about your only option. But I'd recommend you save your [money] and throw them in a small duffel."
1,THOMAS CARRY BAG,"My son received this bag for Christmas 2001, it is very poor quality. It is not durable, the straps tore loose from the bag with in just a few months. If your child is anything like mine, Thomas goes everywhere he goes. This bag cannot handle the wear and tear. If your looking for something to carry your train set in you need to look further."
3,We Love It,My son got this case for his 2nd birthday along with the Figure 8 trian set.He loves it and is so funny trying to carry it around the house.I think it is a great way to carry and store the trian set.I dont know what we would do w/o it.I dont know just how durable it will be because it is still new.I do know that we liked it so much that we recommended it for a gift to another 2 year old and he loves it as well.Basically it has been a big hit all around!!!
4,"Good product, make sure you have the right part though","I ordered these because I had a hinge bust on the cabinet; these appear to be the exact quality of the ones I had, but I ordered the wrong type; they were so inexpensive there was no point to return them. They should work just fine.."
4,Nice and simple.,"This hinge fit exactly into the recess used by the original. I just needed to drill pilot holes for the screws, which were in different places than the original, 20 year old, hinge. I chose a drill bit slightly thinner than the screws and put masking tape on the bit at the point I had to stop in order to avoid drilling clear through the door.Three quick drills, and I was done.Great product. Just enough spring to close the door when it's ajar, but not enough so it would not stay open. It lets you adjust the precise overlay you need to make the door centered in its frame and lined up in all directions."
3,Bogus - glad I read the reviews before buying this,"At the end of ""A Scanner Darkly"" the credits certainly imply that 4 songs included on the soundtrack will be by Radiohead, various members of Radiohead, or Thom Yorke himself. Clearly, that is not the case, and while the music may be good it is not what I expect to get on the soundtrack when I watch the movie credits. It's nice to know that I already have the good songs from the soundtrack on my collection of CD's from Radiohead/et al. I'm sure the rest of the music is nice, but I'll leave it to the true afficianado of ethereal, instrumental melancholy."
5,Magnificent recording,"All of the early Manitas de Plata records are essential. Anyone who has heard any of these recordings that appeared on lp in the 60s knows what the story is. If an occaisonal guitar flub, or an idea that may abruptly change direction, will turn you off, then this is not for you. But if you want to hear artistry at the highest, these are highly recommended. The music is real and vital. It is not ""practised"" flamenco, but authentic. If this is not great flamenco, then I guess I don't like flemenco, but rest assured it is great flamenco."
1,Fake flamenco,"The best I can say about Manitas is that he comes from the same extended french Gitano family which produced the flamenco pop group ""Gypsy Kings."" At least the Kings don't pretend to be playing ""flamenco puro"" but embrace the popular forms of gypsy ""Rumbas"" with some ""Bulerias"" thrown in now and then (always in the proper rhymn or ""compas."" Manitas is notorious among flamenco aficianos for messing up the rhythms, and playing rather uninspired melodies. But the real evidence of his mediocrity is that when judged by the old American Bandstand criteria, ""you can't dance to it."" The best flamenco guitarist, of this age or any earlier, is the one who can accompany the dance and the cante. Good flamenco recordings are more available in the U.S. than ever before. Don't wast your time on Manitas de Plata, ""Little Hands of Silver."" All that glitters, etc. etc."
1,"Hey, this is not music","How can you give five stars to people just talking, anybody can talk. While other people give four stars to a Radiohead or a Porcupine Tree great album, other guys come here and give FIVE stars to Slash's speaches. Sometimes I just can not understand young people. This stuff is just for GNR hardcore fans, something I am not."
5,These rockers are great...forever!!!,I think that these people are fantastic.And their 97.7HTZ-FM is fantastic too.The songs are very mad and interesting.I like it.I hope Guns'n'roses never stop to publish your albums from now on.I think that this band and their album are remain rock legends forever.I love them!!!Bulgaria
5,Kirkman Never Misses,"Ever since i first picked up Invincible Vol. 1, i've been hooked on Robert Kirkman's new series. It has gone on to become my favorite comic of late. The characters are great and Robert's first story arc comes to a head in this latest volume. And it's a doozy. i won't spoil anything but let's just say Kirkman finshes it off with his usual touch of greatness. Pick this book up. In fact pick all of his Invincible books up if you haven't! Now i'm going to go order Tech Jacket and try to pass the time until Invincible Vol. 4 comes out:)"
3,Fine product but actually has been superseded by 7569,"The 7708 has the same dimensions as the current ProHunter Flextech stocks so was redundant and does not have the overmolded grip insert of the Flextech. Both the 7708 and the 7569 Flextech have the same gaps at the front when used with a 24' standard taper barrel, which is very minor."
2,Returned,"I bought this and promptly sent it back. It gave me a cut that looked like a silhouette of a cat head. It's a very small blade. On my saw it would only allow, approximately, a 3/8"" cut. I guess it's better thanone of those wobble type blades though."
4,Not bad for the price,"The oak finish and semi-solid core are what I consider a better value than what Target had to offer. The mount mechanism needed some drywall anchors though-beware. The breakaway mount mechanism seemed a little flaky, but so far the kids have not put too much pressure on it to cause a problem. As a guy who prefers to over-engineer, I would have liked to anchor the shelf into a wall stud, but bottom line the shelf has not come down and the finish is pretty nice for the cost when you compare it to what Target has to offer."
4,perfect for what i needed,Easy to put together and to hang. A really good product for the money. I would recommend this to anyone who needs a quick shelf fix.
1,useless as delivered,"the mounting instructions don't work, the holes in the shelf are too haphazardly drilled to grip tightly on the pins in the braces, so there's no way the thing will stay together. you can buy metal braces and screw them into the shelf and that'll work, but then why not just buy a shelf and some braces instead of this wacky thing? doesn't even make no kinda sense at all."
2,Fell Off the Wall!,"The shelves are strong, but the little pins you screw into the wall have a tendency to slip out of the wall and your shelf will fall down if you don't have the weight on top perfectly balanced! I had to go buy metal brackets to screw into the base and the wall to keep my shelves from coming down.If you only want it for a picture frame or if you put it somewhere you don't care if it falls, it works and looks good. However, if you have kids and they might grab one corner, watch out! Buy some metal brackets, paint them, and then install the shelves."
4,Very compact display of basic car principles,"This book shows details in the car, meaning and use of them and also provides many technical details to help you understand how things in your vehicle works. Many technical drawings are included to show you details, which can hardly be described by words. Some things, which were used in past, but are now almost forgotten (like Wankl engine)are also included, which is very positive. I also liked the fact, that the book covers also areas of car like heating and air-condition, not only gearbox and engine. You can build your own car following this book. I rated it 4 stars because the language used in this book is very technical and someone, who is not very familiar with the expressions, can easily get lost in it. But for someone who is familiar with this language and wants to know everything about the car, this book is a MUST!"
5,bringing to life two very important people. I feel that I have a better understaner knowledge of,I loved this documentary. What dedication and research is shared in this film. Outstanding musical score. Tight editing and careful explanations of the material. Just great!
2,$1.99 for 8min!,"Ok, I didn't pay attention so here is a warning for anyone else...Note these are single 8 minute toons for $1.99 each!"
1,very unhappy purchaser,"this iteam has repeated, episodas throughout the contents of this dvd set. also the openning credits theme songs, and closing credits theme songs, on every episoda is also missing, as well as, the interduction to other cast cartoons that is suppose to be line up on each show.The Huckleberry Hound, Vol. 1 - Disc 1"
5,Huckleberry Hound Cartoons are GREAT!!,"Any fan of saturday morning cartoons should buy this set! It includes hours of some of the best Hanna Barbera cartoons ever made (in the late 1950's, when Hanna Barbera cartoons where still fresh and imaginative). Sure these cartoons were made in the early days of television animation, and the animation is primitive and choppy, but the characters in these cartoons are some of the greatest characters in cartoon history. Huckleberry Hound is very funny, Pixie and Dixie and Mr. Jinx also made me laugh, and Yogi Bear is of course classic! These were some of the very first cartoons that Hanna Barberba made when they moved to TV, and you can see the cartoons get better and better with each episode. Plus, there are some great extras, including the pilot episode, the original Huckleberry Hound theme song, and classic 1950's Kellogg's commercials featuring the characters of this set. This is a must have for kids AND adults!"
5,"Hello, Hanna Barbera? Fans are waiting for Volumes 2 and 3.....","Wonderful shows, beautiful quality. Someone did a bang-up job of piecing together the old lead-ins and commercials from whatever video source material was available, good or bad. The feature on Daws Butler is a lot of fun.Many of my favorite Huckleberry Hound/Pixie & Dixie/Yogi Bear cartoons were in seasons 2 and 3. So I thought, ""If Volume 1 (Season 1) is THIS great, then I want to order Volumes 2 and 3!""But......there ARE NO Volumes 2 or 3 on DVD. Rats. Volume 1 came out WAY BACK in 2005. And since then, NO DVDS of seasons 2 or 3. A story all too commonplace in the DVD marketplace. The baby boomers who love these shows are healthy enough and rich enough AT THE PRESENT TIME to make it a worthwhile endeavor. I sure hope someone in the industry is reading this."
5,Huckleberry Hound on DVD at last,"Huckleberry Hound is by far my favorite cartoon character and this is going to be one awesome box set. Warner Home Video has digitally remastered the original shows and will present them as they aired. The Huck cartoons will be supplemented by Yogi Bear and Pixie, Dixie and Mr. Jinks. The bumpers between the cartoons will be there as well as the opening and closing theme songs.This set will have all 26 episodes from Huck's first season which aired from 1958-1959. This is a dream come true. Don't pass this opportunity up to own a true classic."
5,Absolutely FANTASTIC collection!,"I didnt realize the 'episodes' consisted of 1 Yogi Bear, 1 Pixie & Dixie and 1 Huckleberry Hound cartoon when I was buying it. At first it was a bit confusing, I didnt realize this was the original format, but I had forgotten all about Pixie and Dixie...and I love Yogi Bear too....so this turned out 100 times more enjoyable than it would have been.No way to go wrong with this boxed set."
2,episodes freeze up and skip,I have never wrote a negative review but because of the quality of these disc it may be beneficial to others. The disc freeze up and skip I couldn't watch the first two. My 3 year old boy was disappointed as well as I. We looked forward to watching these together.
5,Perfect!,"I got this hat for my boyfriend who is attending the Red Sox/Yankees game next week in Boston, and he is absolutely gaga for it! It's very comfortable, fits well and is made of very nice material. Not to mention it was a great price! Definitely a great cap for any Red Sox fans out there!"
2,Be leary!,"Jack plays a lot of melodica on this disc, which makes it unlistenable to this jazz enthusiast. I wish I hadn't bought it!"
3,Get ready to host a funky party!,"This book is quite clever and has some really cool party ideas. The book provides invitation, recipe, craft and game ideas for each of the 12 themes. While I think the themes are fun & very cool, they are really geared more towards the gay crowd. I enjoyed the book but gave it to my gay friends -- they are having much more fun with it than I did!"
4,even my older kids like this,"This movie is definitely made with younger children in mind, but my 8 and 10 year old don't seem to mind that and enjoyed watching it, too."
3,"Not my ""favorite holiday songs""","Beautiful footage with my ""favorite holiday tunes."" So, the ""tunes"" are familiar, but the lyrics have been rewritten about the animals. Kind of kills the ""holiday sing-along"" mood."
4,Fun,Toddler thinks it's a hoot! I like that she's learning something while getting excited for xmas! It's a little silly but we are talking about toddler fun here. It was really cheap when I bought it and would again.
2,Redbird,It didn't play in a typical CD player as described in the listing. Very disappointed as it was an intended gift:(:(:(
4,a bird in context,"agnes martin, minimalist, worked primarily in pencil and paint on canvas, creating a body of work rich in subtlety, her washed color squares, often crosshatched grids, offer an illusory shimmer. again, as in earlier recordings inspired by works of joseph cornell and marcel duchamp, zorn replicates in musical tones another artist's, martin's, work, in this case adding a focal point to ambience.or from a different listening perspective, i first listened to this recording during a rainstorm. usually i enjoy listening to a rainstorm for its own music, but i found redbird to be a complimentary piece.other listening perspectives: playing duras by zorn after the redbird recording, the build up to anthony coleman's piano is stunningly beautiful. or include on your cd carousel just about any cd by olivier messiaen, i have a feeling that with redbird john zorn also may had been thinking of messiaen's birds."
3,objection,"I just heard Redbird on the radio. In fact only a part of it. But found it sufficiently beguiling that I am ordering it right now. On such brief acquiantance there is little I can say about it other than to state that it does NOT sound like Morton Feldman... well perhaps in an extremely superfical way it does, but that is about the extent of it. It's unfair to both composers to make this a significant point of catagorization."
3,"Not the best, but a useful tool","I purchased these dividers to layout hand cut dovetails. Granted, these are definitely not the best money can buy, but they serve their intended purpose. True, they were packed in shipping grease, but in less that a minute, they were cleaned and ready to use. The 3"" size designation is not the leg length, but the maximum setting between the legs. When reading reviews, take this into consideration- do previous raters have a history of not being satisfied with ANY purchases?"
2,Falling bristles,"Like some others have said, if you are using this for automotive uses, which ATD makes things for, you will find that the bristles start falling out of the handle holes almost immediately. In 10 minutes of use, I lost about 10 clumps of bristles. If you need a brush for automotive brakes/rust removal, this definitely isn't it. It is probably ok for light household uses however."
1,brush,This thing is a joke I used it to lightly clean up the splines on a pinion gear and a bunch of the wires fell right out of the brush. I should of went to walmart and bought a $1.25 brush and it would of been better. I own numerous ATD products and by far this is the worst product I have bought yes I know it a wire brush but thought it would of stood up better than it did
3,Didn't Work At All With My Grill,I bought this based on other's recommendations here that it would work as a grill brush. It didn't work at all for me. I'm rating this a 3 because I don't want to give an entirely negative rating because this brush may work for other purposes. For cleaning my grill it was a complete dud. I would not recommend this at any price for grill cleaning.
1,one time use only,The brush is of so poor quality that the wire 'hair' fel off the brush before I finished brushing the grille grid.It practically fell apart after less than 2 minutes of brushing.It's not worthed a penny.
4,good 12 inch plastic wire brush,"I bought this as my old wooden one had lost bristles on the first 3 rows, so it was only good for generic cleaning (nothing where the brisles need to be near the front of the brush). This 12-1/2 inch long plastic wire brush has metal bristels that are 1 inch deep by 5"" long x 1"" wide. It also has a hole in the handle rear if you want to attach a strap to carry it/hang it somewhere. The curved handle keeps the hand from getting bruised. I used it for 5 minutes scraping mold off a concrete wall and only 1 bristle was bent a little - none fell out. I expect it to last at least a year or more for such a small price. From Seattle 2-22-2011"
2,Not for smaller kids,We have Superman From the Fifties and it was a total hit for my son who is 8. I felt this one had elements that we normally filter out so we returned it.
4,while you were sleeping,"like a crosstown traffic jam between seal, ttd, roni size, and roachford(whose voice is eerily similar to scott's), glen scott fuses rock, drum n' bass, r&b, and pop into a steamy stew. heaven is just funky, my world predates cher and madonna's vocoder realised vocals, valentine malloy is as sweet a ballad as anything oasis has come up with. give this one a try, you may be suprised."
4,Nice array of sound,"I have been a long time fan of Ron Henderson's music and this CD and specifcally the song ""Gemini Lady"" is one to listen to. I enjoyed the song and look for more from Ron in the future. The song has an old school flavor with a new school touch.Texas Diane"
3,OK if you don't have much time,"This was a collection of quotes. I gave it to my 12-year-old daughter, who shared it with her friends. They all love it."
3,waterford lismore rectangular tray,"When I received it I was disappointed. I had bought as a signed Waterford tray, but only had the sticker. Otherwise, it is a beautiful piece, although I am not sure that is real."
5,Barbara in Beverly Hills,Barbara Woodhouse Goes To Beverly HillsA fun retro video. Shows Barbara assisting celebrities of the day with simple handling of their dogs.
3,It's alright... I guess...,Well... it's a pretty good cd to have if you're a huge Metallica collector.. but if you're buying it just to buy it... you won't really like it...
5,alaskan classic!!!,"so it seems thst i am the only alaskan to review this album, what is up with that. so this artist, colleen coadic has really got around, touring with Ani, was a high light, and gave other to see, her and expierence the coadic vibe. she is the alaskan Ani, and any fan of Ani would dig her, alot!!! there is acoutic havoc on this album, as well as the raging coadic voice, it is just amazing. this album is going in my favorates shelf for sure. for the indie folkie fan types this album is a must!!!"
5,Masterpiece,"This is my favourite book. I read it every year in the past 12 years. It makes you feel like you are the main character. You feel Tracey's fear, pain and triumphs. The book takes you to a fantastic journey and adventures all over the world.A must read!"
5,It Doesn't Get Better Than This,"Tracy Whitney is by far Sheldon's most exciting, witty and intriguing heroine. She had the comfortable, secure life she wanted until her mother commited suicide and she became determined to get revenge on the man she feels responsible for her mother's misery. From there her life falls apart with the blink of an eye. She loses all hope; but not for long. She, with a little help, transforms her entire being into a cunning burglar who will outsmart any person in her way. If you want to be impressed, read this genious thriller and you'll never put it down. Sheldon surpasses all other superior minds with this one- the best I've read so far."
5,"If this isn't a page turner, I don't know what is!","This was one of the most exciting books I have ever read. It is the story of a woman named Tracy Whitney. She gets framed for a crime, and is harshly punished. Afterword, she gets released from prison for doing a good deed for a warden, and after getting even with those who turned against her, she begins to become highly wealthy from pulling off one con after another.While the cons may seem to get tedious, they put you on the edge of your seat. Just when you think Tracy is going to get her due, she amazingly escapes again. This novel is nearly flawless. The only think I didn't like was that she was going to get revenge on her ex-fiance, but she seems to just forget about it. But, it's okay. Don't miss this novel."
3,The Shawshank Redemption & The Sting,"I've read a few books by this author and have enjoyed them the same. It strongly reminds me of The Sting and The Shawshank Redemption, not that its a bad thing....just to give you an idea of what it can be best described with. Though it has a slow start, it picks up quite well. The plots, which are very cleverly devised, seem very simple without mentioning unnecessary details. The characters fit in just right. Enjoy!! (rath0051@tc.umn.edu)"
4,"Cheesy, but exciting.","This was my first Sidney Sheldon experience, and I will definitely read more of his books. Aside from a few chapters of disturbing prison behavior, this was a good book that made me think about clever ways to rip people off. The plot was well thought out and plausible, although the romance was a little hard to believe. All in all it was a good book."
5,All Time Best!!,"I have read this book thrice and intend to readit once more after my exams get over. I highlyrecommend this book for the age-group 15-45.This book is undoubtedly the best FICTIONbook I have ever read.Apart from a few a few erotic pages, this book isideal for fiction or mystery loving book-readres.The story can be divided into 2 different parts;one about the prison life of a young girl namedTracy Whitney alongwith her revenge over acouple of mafia members and the second abouther fantastic theft adventures all over the world.The 2nd part of the book has been imaginative-ly written with lots of intelligently planned thefts.It is very similar to other Sidney Sheldon writingsespecially the ""Doom's Day Conspiracy"".If any of the parents wish to lure their childreninto literature, this book is the one they shouldstart with"
5,A Wonderful Read!,"In ""If Tomorrow Comes"" Sidney Sheldon keeps you turning the pages from the first to the last. When the book ended, I wanted to read more. A great journey of a read with awesome characters and many wonderful story lines. This is the 2nd Sidney Sheldon book I have read (along with Rage Of Angels), and it certainly won't be my last. I plan to read all of his books. You will not be disappointed. Happy Reading!"
5,A touching thrilling story,"A Great story about a woman who wants justice by revenging the cruel people who destroyed her life. The first part when the heroine is in prison is fascinating. So does the part of the revenge. The part of the robberies is interesting although sometimes not that realistic like the chess trick. This was my first Sidney Sheldon and it convinced me to read his other books. After reading eight of them, 'If tommorow comes' is only second to 'the other side of midnight'. Anyway, I think that if tommorow comes is Sidney Sheldon at his best."
3,Good product,"Because it is used, I can't expect it's still new. The cover was a bit old but the content is not so bad. It is a good item anyways."
4,Amazing robs,"This is an excellent story, the first part of the book when tracy goes to jail and when she get out and takes revenge for her mother, the second part is a little bit repetitive with her robs because one and another, and another were almost the same, except the last one, that was an amazing one."
2,Reality potrayed Brutally,"I don't want to deride the book and thats not why i'm here, in my opinion the book was giving the cruel facts brutally. In case the ones who've read this book do not identify the episode i'll ask them to go back to when tracy whitney was taken to the jail, after 2 years of reading it the impression it has created in my mind prevails and haunts me when i think of a jail, it's true and i dont deny it but i would suggest that those who cannot take cruelty in a light way and those who get really involved please don't go for this book. This is in no way a book for light reading. No doubt as always sheldon't characterisation and plot is well articulated and potrayed very well and leaves an everlasting impression.One episode in the book changes my complete view about it though."
5,Captivating,"Sheldon really captivates readers with this book through his interesting heroine, Tracy Whitney. Not knowing what is going to happen to her next keeps you reading. It's a bit of mystery, crime, and romance all intertwined."
3,Not his best....,"I have always been a fan of Mr Sheldon and have read and re-read nearly all his books. This book started off extremely well and held me spellbound - and thrilled - a real page-turner. And then it sort of went.... well, just past being entirely credible. But, that being said, he does spin a good yarn and for sheer escapism it is well worth the read."
3,Interesting but long winded,I enjoyed this book but felt it a little long winded. Plot and story line could have been told withmore flair and less drag.
5,Great Adventure,If you want to read a book with non stop adventure and excitement with a uplifting story this is the book for you.
5,Don't start reading if you plan to sleep tonight!!!!,"This is the best novel I have ever read. The first few chapters is gripping, unstoppable, and a can't put down book until the end. When you are on the last chapter, you just want to read it all over again. Sheldon is truly the master of the game!"
4,If Tomorrow Comes is realy the Master of the Game,"I realy love the book's opened ending and always wonder if Tracy and Jeft would run into a new adventure. I hope to be read the second episode of If Tomorrow Comes with a new title, like ....Please, Mr Sheldon think about it!"
5,Sheldon at his best,"This was a simply brilliant book! I would recommend it for ages 15-35. It was one of the best fiction stories I've read, which brings out all the emotions from the reader. This book was written by one of the best authors around"
5,If Tomorrow Comes,Excellent read Sidney Sheldon is a remarkable author. Every book by this author is very exciting and will be reading most of his writings.
4,You cannot put it down!,"The protagonist of this book is absolutely superbly described, her feelings are real and you start feeling like this book is talking about you, no matter how far away you are from having the same things happen to you. It is incredible and you cannot put it down!"
5,I couldn't put this book down!,This book was brilliant! I loved all the twists and turns. I never knew what would happen next. He has become my new favorite author. I can't wait to read more of his books.
2,Two books in one,The first part of the book acts as the set-up for the second. The first is slow and the description of how the protagonist takes revenge from her enemies is frankly naive. The second part is better but still if it's supposed to be a thriller it would have to be addressed for early-teeners not for adults.
2,Predictable pap,"At the risk of being politically incorrect, I think this is a book that will appeal to bored housewives. After an interesting beginning, the book falls into cliche after cliche as our heroine continually outwits the authorities in increasingly implausible scenarios. I really can't believe so many reviewers gave this book 5 stars. It really is a rather pedestrian work. One reviewer couldn't give it 5 stars because of the ""excessive sex."" Must be a very sensitive type because I thought there was relatively little sex in the book and what there was was handled in a very romanticized way. Another indicated that it was the best book she had ever read!! My advice...read more books.If this is indicative of Sheldon's work, I certainly won't be reading any more of his books."
2,Utter nonsense,"Sheldon tried to create a plot consisting of a string of unrelated scams pulled by his heroine Tracy White, succeeding in all of them, certainly, this is very difficult to believe by a serious reader. The main character and heroine, Tracy White working for a man named Gunther, becomes a modern Robin Hood ripping off cardboard characters of unsavory reputations with no logical reason at all, just for the sake of doing. The so called story goes superbly fast and the scores of situations popping up get solved in a couple of pages one after another with an abuse of twist and turns but there is no plot after all. I have rated it two stars one goes for the poor quality and another goes for the fun the story sometimes carries on, particularly in the beginning. If this is your first time with Sidney Sheldon, try other Sheldon novels, i.e ""Master of the Game""."
5,"After reading this book, I have been hooked on Sheldon!!",This book is by far the best book Sidney Sheldon has written so far. The story line and character development is ingenious! I have and probably always will judge every book I read to If Tomorrow comes. I don't see how he thought this up. Excellent!!!
2,If Tomorrow Comes,I didn't care much for the storyline but it was well written.I think that if I don't care for the story line that should be enough for you.
1,Plucked puke,"Hardly (because there are few fleeting moments of Ribot's virtuosity amidst the guitar masochism) more than the introverted vomiting of de-tuned nothingness, this acoustic-on-acid disc sadly highlights the addled composer at his laughable worst."
5,Love Dogs bark up the right tree,"The Love Dogs, for my money, have put down some of the best swing tracks on disc I've heard.. These guys SWING.. Forget Setzer and the Daddies. This one's a winner."
4,Little memo minder!,"This item performed the function it was intended to perform. It only holds one memo though, I thought you could keep pressing record to add a few short sequential memos in a row but it only holds 1. It is very small and portable. When I got my iPhone4s; which is great for memos my little memo minder fell by the wayside. But it did well and was worth the money I spent."
3,Not as bad as these reviews show,"I laughed when I read the reviews...how can I take seriously a review from a customer when so many words are spelled incorrectly...they don't actually know the character names (it's Tavis...not Travis). This series is not the deepest or most intricate plot in the FR series of books, but it's a fun, quick read. The characters are enjoyable and that's all it really needs to be."
1,Silly ending to a possible decent series,"Save yourself the time and skip this realms series. The first book was decent, but the second and third were just plain waste of paper. I like the main characters, but a good story to back them up. Travis, the ranger, provides a great hero, but the bad guys/fight scences were stupid. The Netheril trilogy was ten times better so do not lose the realms faith."
1,terribly cheap...piece of junk,"I realize this toy was only $30, but this is the biggest piece of junk I have ever seen. I put this together exactly like the instructions said and tighten everything good and snug, and the thing fell apart in my hands as I was putting it together. They use little rubber grommets instead of clips to hold shafts in place. These grommets fall off before you even get it together. I had an erector set when I was a child, and thought that it would be a great gift for my children to play with. But this toy is nothing like the one i had as a child. The poor quality of this product is absolutely disgusting and I would never buy another product from this company again. I would not recommend this toy or any other products from this company to anyone."
1,Don't buy it!,Trying to put this thing together for my son was a truly miserable experience. Eventually I gave up because it was so frustrating! Very sad since he bought it with his own money.
