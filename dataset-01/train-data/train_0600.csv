3,Well...,"I am new to the foreign type films, so if you are like me and had some friends show you one or two of these things that were so jaw dropping with action you couldn't wait to see more, then this movie is a bit of a letdown for action and storyline. Pretty much everyone else has given their ideas of what the movies about and all, but I'm just going to say that you wait an entire movie just for an awesome gun fight at the end. It's dubbed Chinese by default, so us Americans will have to switch it over to English which doesn't go along with the subtitles at all. Unless you happened to pick up some Chinese or any of the other 6 languages I think it has in high school or college. Anyhow the sound is very good, and the gunfights make you want to go buy some 9mm's and practice with your friends."
4,Shiri,"Until recently, Korea banned all movies that depicted North Korea as anything other than bumbling and incompetant. By depicted the North Korean plight is such a moving way, Han really went out on a limb. Directors before Han that tried to do the same thing were thrown in jail. However, the South Korean government allowed this movie to be shown, and Shiri grossed more than Titanic did when it opened in Korea.I thought that this movie was excellent, not because of the action (which was rather gory at times) but because of the storyline. It sheds new light on the suffering of North Koreans. I also, thought that the characters were well developed, especially the lead female. Even though some parts were rather predictable, I thought that it was a very moving and compelling story. I would definately recommend seeing this movie."
3,"It's ok, but...","first of all don't be fooled by the picture of the girl on the dvd cover. There is a super female assasin but she's never dressed in skimpy clothing. Another problem is with the good guys. They can't hit anything they shoot at. The bad guys seem to have unlimited ammo. And the good guys just can't seem to surround a building they know the bad guys are in. The story itself isn't so bad and the action is alright. If you can get past the other problems, it might be worth watching.Post Edit: I've watched this movie 3 times now and I find that my opinion of it is getting better everytime. But I can't seem to change my rating from 3 to 4 stars."
5,"One Of The Best Movies That I've Seen In A Long, Long Time!","I think that this is an absolutely great film. I just watched the DVD last night. It has great action scenes, a great plot, great romance and many surprising twists. This is one of the few movies that you enjoy more when you know less about it before you see it (Don't read too many reviews. They give away too much about it. Its best watched ""cold"".). If I could only buy (10) DVDs in my life, this would be one of them.Eddy C."
4,Creative Asian movie,"Pretty good movie, but not over the topIt was nice seeing Asian scenery, but it could have been as good as James Bond movie if they had fleshed out movie.Like they say ... So sorry"
3,"Good, but not great...","I thought this movie was about a female super-assasin, like Agent 47 in Hitman. It's not. In fact, you don't see this so-called super assasin do anything super in the movie, or close to it, other than openning credits.This is an action movie revolves around two South Korean agents chasing a ghost of an assasin and stumbling on a bomb threat.Apart from the Korean political content, this movie is a clone of any other Hollywood action movie. There are nice twists and turns but some can be rather predictable.Acting and the visual quality of the movie is very good, then again there are some disjointed scenes where you go 'Huh, how did they ...', don't worry no spoilers.Maybe I didn't quite get the movie because I was fooled by the cover and the overview. Overall, it's a good movie but just like many others said it's another action movie. Rental for us non-Koreans and I suppose a keeper for Koreans."
3,Just ok,Recipes are good but not better than I have found on the net. I am an American with access to international markets and still can't always find all the spices called for even though I get the feeling this book is dumbed down for the non Indian cook.
2,Skip this one,This coffee plugged up my pot and didn't have near the flavor I am used to getting from a flavored coffee. I did use it all but ended up mixing it with another flavor in order to spice it up a bit. I wouldn't buy this one again. I drink flavored coffee everyday.
2,Would Not Recommend ~ Outdated anyway,All I have ever gotten is a few great pics out of this. Initially it came with ink cartridge and 6 pics. Those were great. Then I had unresolvable feeder problems. I couldn't resolve it and I had to feed it each photo 1 at a time. The ink replacement costs as much as the printer and the yield is much lower then claimed. I will stay with Canon because I usually have more bad feed problems with HP. Also the photo comes out crisper/sharper. I will just get a larger less specialized unit.
3,Alright,Got this as a Christmas gift It is Alright Cant get rid of lines running down photos replaced everything still not 100%
5,CP 510 great compact printer,"I just want to ask J. Cole, that when he went to print his photo from the camera, did he make sure the camera was printing borderless? I have made that error once, when you go to print from the camera make sure its printing borderless. If not you will get a white border around the picture.The printer does great for on the go and when I want to print pictures from any family function, vacations. I took it with me to see my first grandchild in the hospital and was able to print pictures immediately from my camera for all the relatives that came to see him. Everyone was thrill with it! I have a CP220 also, and it does a great job also, but it does get overheated sometimes.The price you can't beat for the quality of prints."
3,Not Thrilled,"The idea is a good one - small dedicated photo printer anyone can use. But the unit is actually fairly complicated for the novice user I bought it for (my mother), and it requires fairly expensive consumables and requires special Canon photo paper."
4,Nice Little Printer,"No doubt the price of the printer, the price per print (you need to shop around for the ink though), and the quality of the print combine to be an excellent choice. Just that I have some trouble feeding the paper some time, but with that price, I won't worry about it too much."
2,Don't count on using your other printer paper..,The printer itself prints good photos. The biggest drawback is you have to buy the Canon replacement cartridge which comes with paper. I already have paper but I can't use it because I have no options other than to buy the way they pack. There needs to be an alternative to buy just the cartridge. I would think about it before I bought it - if you already have photo paper.
1,"Not pleased, even with the price!","I know I am going against the grain of all these glowing reviews but here is what I have found.1. No USB cord provided!2. You have to buy a special paper (they don't state what it is in the book) that has tear off tabs at both ends and narrower than most 4x6 paper. Paper needed is HARD TO FIND. Regular Canon 4x6 paper DOES NOT WORK! I've tried many other brands, none fit or print.3. Ink cartridge only prints 5 SHEETS! These cartridges are also hard to find. (meaning you can't always pop out to Walmart or an office supply to get it.)4. NOT INTUITIVE. MUST READ MANUAL and it is still not clear.5. Battery not included, must buy seperately.6. You have to buy any other paper cassette size separately (not included)Conclusion: May be cheap but you'll pay and pay for the supplies to keep it running!"
2,Crops pictures severely!,"This unit is easy to use and makes great looking prints however as my wife found out after her first weekend trip with it, it crops off the top and bottom of the picture file. I bought her the package which included the Canon 520 camera and this printer. She printed out pictures of people and found the tops of heads cutoff. The reason is the proportions of the sensor on the camera are more square than 4x6 so the printer just cuts off the top and bottom of the digital picture file. No warning in the manual, no way to print the full picture file on a 4x6 paper by leaving space at the ends. Nice work Canon!"
5,GRRREAT,"Bought this printer for my wife. She LOVES scrapbooking. We also have a Canon SD400 camera, which connects with no problem. Anywho, the printer is great, it fits in a small video camera bag with our digital camera, battery for printer, paper, ink cartriges, and paper cartriges. The quality of the prints is as good or not better than what we get from some well know labs. And she can use it when she goes scrapbooking, without having to develop 3243243214 photos prior."
5,Excellent quality prints,"This is an excellent photo printer. I'm a photo enthusiast and I've had photos printed from online shops like Kodakgallery and printed the same photos on this printer for comparison. I can't tell any difference between the photos from the online print shops and the ones from the printer. The only annoying thing about this printer is that the print proportions do not exactly fit 4x6 print proportions. For most people this won't be a problem, but because I very carefully crop my photos so that exactly what I crop is what will print, it's annoying that pieces of the photo get cut off. I get around this by adjusting the length width proportions so that they will fit on the printer page."
2,The calling,I really don't like religious themes.- I recognize it was well written but unfortunately it bored me a little bit
3,1,"This was a charming story and all of the details of this little woman's struggle bringing God to a strange town, and many unwilling people. However, I agree with another review on here, that details were left out. It was never explained why Mr. Travis was found passed out on her doorstep, which bugged me, the reader must have been expected to know what the author was thinking. I was also very upset with the idea that Sophie had that God allowed her son to die just so she and her other children would want to go to Heaven some day. What terrible things Christians accuse our Lord of! A human mother would not allow her child to die for any of the various reasons people come up with to explain these things. We live in a fallen world and death is one of the byproducts of it. Death is not of God! I also agree that the ending was disappointing, I would have liked to know if Emily and Shad married or if he began preaching in the town or if he and Emily co-preached."
2,Misses the Mark,I did not find this story believable. The main character had too many hardships to overcome and I did not agree she could surmount them in the manner that Oke described. I felt it was a little anti-male as well.
2,Review of Calling of Emily Evans,I believe that Janette Oke stepped beyond the boundaries of the Bible in writing this one.
5,A Great Read,"This account of a young woman following God's voice to the mission field in an era where women were only supposed to marry the first boy or man that came along and raise a family is truly inspirational. Not that I have anything against raising families. This book inspired me to believe through writing only as Jeanette Oke can, that I too, even with a family of my own can be used by God. What a wonderful adventure in someone elses shoes as well! I highly reccomend this book!"
5,A tender and touching story,"The Calling of Emily Evans is a tender and touching story. Young Emily gets her calling to become a pastor while in Bible School. While her father doesn't want her to go off by herself to minister to a new community, Emily's mind is made up. This is her calling and it is what she's going to do.Emily does not have an easy time trying to build her congregation. She is met by challenges but faces them head on. She never gives up. She is very determined to make her church successful and doesn't want anyone to know when time are hard for her.The Calling is a wonderful story. Ms. Oke writes about characters the reader finds themselves caring about. From Emily to Big John the characters are wonderfully written. The plot is good and the development of the characters is excellent. This book is great! It is a tender,touching story that will warm your heart. Definitely worth reading and recommending to someone! Read today!!"
4,Beautiful Story,"This is the first ""pioneer story"" I've read in a long time. To tell the truth, I was tired of the same story told using a hundred different heroines. The Calling of Emily Evans is classic Janette Oke. It is a story of faith and inspiration, hard work and courage. Based on the actual ministry of early church workers, or ""Sister Workers"", the book tells the story of one young woman who answers God's calling and goes forth into a field which was once reserved only for men. Even her own father doubts her ability and the Church's good intentions, but ultimately shows his support.Emily's life is full of turmoil and personal doubt. Her collegues who also answered God's leading seem to be so much better suited to their mission that she is. She fears she is doing everything wrong. But Emily stays true to her calling, refusing to accept offers of an easier road. While not a romance it is assumed that the heroine will find romance in the end. I enjoyed this little book and recommend it."
2,Emily Evans,This story is non-eventful. In other words boring. I have read Janette Oke for years. I have never read anything so uneventful from her. I only finished it because I had already committed. I would not recommend it.
2,The Calling of Emily Evans,I have enjoyed Janette Oakes other books. This one didn't seem to have much depth. It would have been more interesting to see how Emily influenced some of her parishoner's lives. I would like to have heard about the life she and her husband had together in the ministry.
4,Still a good read,I first read this story when I was a teenager and I loved the story then. Decided to get the e-book and read it again. It is still an excellent book. However I was left wanting to know the rest of the story. While I know I have read the rest of the series before I now want to reread book 2 to see if I get the rest of Emily's story.
5,Wonderfully well written,"This is probably the best Christian fiction since Catherine Mitchell's Christy.Emily Evans has been called to the ministry. We watch her faith grow and become stronger as she struggles to start a church in a small village in western Canada.It's a wonderfully well written, heart-warming story that will have you laughing, crying and smiling.I highly recommend it."
4,Interesting,"This is a really good book. There is nothing I disliked, it was interesting and I would highly recommend this book to everyone"
2,The Calling of Emily Evans,"Too slow............Janette Oke's books are usually very good, I would not recommend this book to any of my friends. Could be so much better."
5,Janette Oke is a great aurthor,I really enjoyed this book by Janette Oke. I have read several other books by her. It shows how hard our founding fathers/mothers of had it.
4,It was just ok,"After reading the Love Comes Softly series, I had to read more by Janette Oke. This didn't live up to my expectations. It did no justice for Emily's story and the ending was too abrupt. I had to make sure I didn't skip pages. There was no closure in some aspects and some things just made no sense. I don't think I will purchase any more of this series."
5,Another great book by Oke,"I love Janette Oke books and this one lived up to that. I recommend this book to anyone, a very family friendly book."
3,Nice work,Interesting and good insight in main characters. Various other stories of the different families well blended. Writing felt very real..
5,I love her books,"I would recommend this book, and any other Janette Oke books, because they are good, clean, wholesome reading. Her books are Christian based with good moral values."
4,Calling of Emily Evans,The story is about a young girl who after attending a Bible Church school goes to a small town to establish a mission church. She is very excited to be establishing this mission. The are good events and bad events but all lead to a new beginning for the Girl and the town.
3,Predictable Storyline,"This is a great Christian book but the story was a bit predictable. Usually this author has me on the edge of my seat and I get stuck in the book until I finish it. This wasn't the case with this book, although I still enjoyed it, I found myself forcing me to finish it."
4,Caution: Not a beginner's guide to postscript!,"I consider myself a hardcore programmer, but I have not programmed with postscript before. When my job required postscript options added to the printer drivers, I started with this book. I now believe it would have been better to start with a beginner's guide and a reference manual on postscript. This book is great if you are already programming in postscript and want to better your skills with it"
4,Edgar with the white trash were really a favourite,"Dear Edgar Winther fan like I am. I really looking for the Cassett, LP or CD from the White Trash live consert where Edgar's brother Johnny came on stage and played among other Tobacco road. Can anyone help me to get that cassett, LP or CD. I only bought cassett many years ago, but the tape broke and it is lost. I do not know the name for that LP, but if anyone can help me I will be glad."
5,Young again,"Took me back to my freshman year in college. Loved Edgar Winter then, love 'em now. Happy I was able to find."
2,Mediocre,This album is by no means bad but it isn't great either!At times there are glimmers of good music like Good Morning Music but overall the album fails to excite the listner.The Trash may have been a good live act but they failed to capture that intensity on the record.Worth a listen but for specific tastes only.
5,Underrated Gem,"On this brass-heavy hard rock album, there is not one track that is not wonderful. From the foot-stomping ""Give It Everything You Got"" to the burlesque beat of ""I've Got News for You"", this is a fine, fine album. Standout tracks include ""Dying to Live"", ""Fly Away"" and ""You Were My Life"", although ALL tracks resonate.If you like Chicago, Blood, Sweat and Tears or Springsteen and the E-Street band, you gotta get this CD."
5,Highly recommended.,This is the first Fossil watch i have purchased and I am very impressed with the quality of this item. It not only looks great but has a nice heavy feel when on the wrist. I don't often rate items with 5 stars - but this one deserves it - highly recommended.
1,Doesn't do what a watch should do,Looks great but doesn't keep good time. After one day it had lost 5 minutes. It seems to speed up and slow down.
4,Good self help book for beauty,"Christie writes a very informative, interesting beauty book full of advice on excersize, diet, hair and skin care. I especially liked the illistrated excercizes. The advice she gives still stands true today at the turn of the millenium."
1,terrible craftsmanship,pressure valve unworkable with creaking sound when trying to pull up and down. So disappointed. I have older model which was great. The Swiss have out engineered themselves on this one. Don't waste you money.
5,Our Favorite Cookware,"We have three Kuhn Rikon pressure cookers that we use almost every time we cook - this is the main cookware we use. It's fast, easy, and it save energy because it takes less time to cook. And the food's great - I like eating at home better than any restaurant."
2,Adequate with shotcomings,"This product was specific to my 32"" Sony lcd tv and fit perfectly. The problem was that the plate bolted directly to the tv and blocked access to all the inputs and outputs. I was only using an HDMI connector, so I just needed to cut a notch in the plate over that input to connect the cable, no a big deal for me, but may be for others.If you have this same access problem, you will need to purchase additional spacers and the correct length screws to offset this plate from the tv in order to utilize the connections as they were meant to be. I estimate a 1"" off set should be adequate."
5,Good textbook,"Got it for a class. Like it as a book. Clear, easy to read. Precise suggestions and tips for interpretation."
3,so so,this book would have been better served to cater to either the professional or the beginner instead of trying to pass out material for both. This book have done with more step by step walk throughs as well.
1,There is better where this came from.,"There are far too many young people listening to this music who have not already heard the prerequisite James Brown's Funky People vol 1, 2. Public Enemy. Souls of Mischief. Pharcyde. DeLaSoul. Tribe Called Quest. Eric B and Rakim. DJ Red Alert. Wu-Tang Clan. Search Amazon for one of these other artists and buy a record from black rap artists and not white boys (apologies to Beastie Boys and 3rd Bass). Then there are Funk essentials also: Isaac Hayes. Curtis Mayfield. Barry White. mid 70s Marvin Gaye Temptations. Bootsy Collins. George Clinton. Funkadelic. Ohio Players. and more. Please do not buy any ICP records until you know the roots of the medium that they are trying to ""Pat Boone."""
5,High up with The RiddleBox,"Exellent, to say the least, this will be the all time favorite of all ICP fans. I pity ppl that critisize ICP, in the typical: ""stupid"" ""rubbish"" ""or senseless"", well thats ICP, they are pouring messages through this dark carnival, 100% fantasy, but none the less, manage to deliver a message when they need too. Why? is it only serious, or ""realistic"" music good? Always better then some fag rapper boasting that he'll kill your 'momma', and 'yo homies' and saying he killed that and this etc etc yada, and HE MEANS it, but none the less was full of s**t, at least ICP make fun of themselves, and even show they bulls**t you when they want. They just act on instinct, and say what they feel, or do what they feel, adding all the colour they must to make some cool original music.'nuff saidPaul Falzon"
3,50/50,"Everyone was tellin me how tight ICP was...But I'd seen pictures of em and seen em on Howard Stern and what have you...They seemed aight...Didn't really like the idea they were wearin make up...But besides that I baught this CD before I would judge them...and this CD isn't all that bad...It has some good songs...And it woulda been 10 times better if most of thier songs weren't ment to be jokes...I just don't like that aspect of thier music...I think it's kinda lame...Best traks are ""The Neden Game"" and ""Pass Me By"" so if you have 15 buks you can burn and are lookin for somethin different to listen to...You might want to chek out this album..."
1,How do these morons have fans? I'm sure stupidity is a factor.,"Ok I'm actually gonna go in a different direction on this review than most of my reviews. Instead of stating that they suck complete and utter ass, are not funny, and seem to be the worst abomination to music of any day and age as fact, I will just say that I think they suck ass. The nice thing about them is that one day they will be too old and feeble to make any more noise. On this day I will rejoice and the world will breathe a powerful sigh of relief."
1,Worst. Band. Ever.,"How anyone could sign these morons is beyond me. This is ""music"" for suburban white kids that want to be ""Big Money Hustla$"". Get a life and listen to real music."
1,NO TALENT,Icp has no talent. I don't like rap but if you want real rap get WU TANG!In portland we don't talk we fight
1,Just plain stupid.,"Throughout the whole album, ICP make the lamest, unfunny jokes I've ever heard. I find it ironic that they make fun of fat people when one of the singers happens to be fat. This album is mindless drivel that no one in their right mind would like. I see that most of the people who happen to like this album come off as very unintellegent. This is not a rap CD. This is not an UNDERGROUND Rap CD. This is just crap."
4,THE BEST ICP CD EVER,"AFTER A FAILED STINT AT JIVE RECORDS, ICP CAME BACK WITH THIS POWERFUL ALBUM. THIS IS ICP AT THEIR BEST. THIS CD, WHICH IS THE 4TH JOKER'S CARD, HAS ICP CLASSICS SUCH AS THE UNDENIABLY TIGHT ''HALLS OF ILLUSIONS'', THE HILLARIOUS ''THE NEDEN GAME'', THE UNEXPECTEDLY SERIOUS ''PASS ME BY'', AND MORE. ON ''PASS ME BY'', ICP REALLY PROVED TO ME THAT THEY CAN GET SERIOUS IF THEY REALLY WANT TO. ''PASS ME BY'' IS THE GREATEST ICP SONG EVER RECORDED. BY THE TIME THIS ALBUM WAS RELEASED, ICP STARTED TO GET A LITTLE ATTENTION. THIS ALBUM ACTUALLY HOLDS THE RECORD FOR THE LONGEST AMOUNT OF WEEKS AN ALBUM HAS EVER STAYED ON THE BILLBOARD TOP 200. FOLLOWED BY A DOUBLE DISC COLLECTION OF RARE AND HARD TO FIND SONGS, ENTITLED ''FORGOTTEN FRESHNESS VOL. 1 AND 2'' AND THE 5TH JOKER'S CARD, ENTITLED ''THE AMAZING JECKEL BROTHERS''."
1,Don't send in the clowns,"It ain't ""dope."" It ain't ""da bomb."" It doesn't ""kick @ss.""It IS a sad reminder of how low popular music has sunk in the '90s."
4,DA BIZZum,"man this album is Somedin else though. Chris JOnes loves this damn cd. The neden game is awesome though, that really is some funny stuff. Hey, but you haven't heard it all. It's this song on there talking about Eminem's momma and it's hilarious. It's the funniest damn thing I've ever heard and has a good beat to it. So these guys are on my ok list. They are cool with me even though they ain't black."
5,A way to get hooked,"If you have been wondering about the Insane clown posse, you know what there all about you should get this cd. You will be hooked on them. Than you can go out and get there other albums. Every cd has a different meaning. This is probally the best one though. ICP FOREVER 2DOPE and Violent J in da haugh. You'll understand if you listen to Beverly KIlls 50187.2 Peace David (JD) Ware"
5,Sick and Wicked CD,"This is the best new CD I've heard in years. It is fun, but real and the beat is killer for cruising."
5,bad @$$ band and cd,"I am not a huge rap fan, but u dont have to love rap to like these guys. Its a mix between rage against the machine and like maybe cypress hill or something. its got a good beat good for just crusin. must buy"
5,Great Fun,"I am a fan of classical music, but I am also rather eclectic, so I jumped at the chance to hear this when a friend lent it to me. I like this CD very much. The first couple tracks have a good beat, and ""How Many Times"" is dark and eerie. There is also some very funny stuff on the CD, the introduction and dating game parody just for starters. I like this CD very much."
4,"Ha, ha-ha, ha, ha, ha-ha-ha, F*** YOU!","Insane Clown Posse is right on point with ""The Great Milenko."" I personally am sick of all the PC crap coming out lately, and all of the boy bands and blonde bimbettes... UGH! In this respect, ICP's ""Great Milenko"" was, in many ways, a God-send (sort of). ICP's funky clown image is just the tip of the iceberg... combine that with their creepy circus-y music, and their unconventional lyrics, and you've got a rap album with the potential to go far...Be sure to check out ""Hokus Pokus"", ""The Great Milenko"", and, everyone's favorite, ""The Neden Game"" (my first exposure to ICP... what an experience!)... definitely not a CD for your parents or for young children, but a must have for anyone else."
5,This is funny stuff,"This is one of the funniest CD's I have ever heard. The comedy bits and blatent profanity will make you laugh until you cry. I am really a heavy metal maniac, but ICP, along with the Beastie Boys, are the only rap group I could ever listen to. The beastie boys just make good music, but this band is funny. If they really put snoop-dog and those losers on the next album, it will ruin the ICP sound. The might have to be serious, that would suck."
5,Best ICP To Date,"The Great Milenko is a little different than other ICP albums. Not only does it have ICP's familiar hilarious lyrics, but it also has a few songs that have some real meaning to them. Such as ""How Many Times"", ""Under The Moon"",and ""Pass Me By."" If you are really into ICP and haven't picked this up yet, you don't know what you are missing out on. ITS THE BEST!"
5,THE BEST CD I'VE HEARD!!!,This cd is the best. Everyone should have a copy. I'm not really into rap. But this cd is so different. it's like nothing you have ever heard. There is no catergory to put ICP in. They are just the best. The Great Milenko is my favorite.The whole cd kicks. Buy this. you won't regret it!
5,Awesome,"Every single god d@mn track on this album kicks @ss. If you are looking for something different, buy this. It's also one of there best albums ever (this and Riddle Box). If you don't like metal mixed with rap try 2pac or Easy-E."
5,Undoubtedly the Most Fulfilling Juggalo Experience,"The album that sent the ICP to the top still amazes. I don't have to say much...this is a winner. ""Hellalejuah"", a song about crooked, money-grubbing priests, is moment of truth to me. This quote will startle many, yet I stand by it. Don't pass this album by."
1,White trash redneck DRIVEL! Utter GARBAGE!,"I wish I could give this lousy CD and band 0 stars! ICP is sonically and lyrically the absolute WORST thing to happen to music. These no-talent posers are devoid of any conception of good music, and rely on simpleton, crass, white trash yahoos and hicks as their fan base. Their popularity is without question further proof of the 'dumbing down of America', in all it's forms. As our crumbling public schools continue to fail our youth, with math, science, and verbal and language skills on the decline, and violent video games and misogynistic music becoming ever so popular, we have to take pause and ask the question ""what is happening to our society and our youth."" ICP is just part of the problem though. Music and standards in general are 'on the decline', everything is 'Made In China' now, and the middle class is dying. Perhaps this garbage is just a reflection of our current state of decline in America?"
5,BEST ICP CD EVER,If You like icp BUY THIS CD. this cd is one of their best.Intro 4/5Great Milenko 5/5Hokus Pokus 5/5Piggy Pie 4/5How Many Times? 10/5Southwest Voodoo5/5Halls of Illusions10/5Under the Moon 3/5What Is a Juggalo? 10/5House of Horrors 10/5Boogie Woogie Wu4/5Neden Game10/5Hellalujah 3/5Down With the Clown 10/5Just Like That 10/5Pass Me By3/5
4,Nifty,From start to finish this is one of the best ICP albums ever recorded. With it's filth and profanity laced lyrics you're sure to be kept highly entertained without the worry of having to suddenly change the track out of sheer boredom. Enjoy audible violence? Than buy this CD.
5,The best Insane clown posse cd ever.,"This is Insane Clown Posses best effort. I love ICP,I have 7 of thier albums (THE GREAT MILENKO,RIDDLE BOX,RINGMASTER,FORGOTTEN FRESHNESS VOL.1,AND 2(2 cds),THE AMAZING JEKEL BROTHERS,and BIZZAR.Ive heard the others too. If your not fimiliar with ICP,than you wont know,but other than the 2 cds called (BIZZAR,and BIZAAR), the 3 FORGOTTEN FRESHNESS albums and all the EPs and the cd singles,they were doing six faces and here are the order from BEST TO WORST.1.THE GREAT MILENKO2.THE AMAZING JEKEL BROTHERS (TIED WITH MILENKO)3.THE RIDDLE BOX4.THE WRAITH5.THE CARNIVAL OF CARNAGE6.THE RINGMASTERps But dont get me wrong they are all 5 star cds!"
1,"Gimmick, gimmick, gimmick, and more gimmick","Wow, I finally listened to an ICP album. I'm a huge rap/hip hop fan and I got to tell you this is a bunch of crap-I'm having a hard time understanding how bad these guys really are. They rely on ""gimmick,"" I give them creativity and pure marketing genius but when it comes down to the music and just the music, it is some real crap. I think people pull for them because they are keeping there fingers crossed for a white breakthrough rap artist, I got to tell you, this ain't it. If you want to listen to some serious rap from the streets hit ""Season of Da Siccness"" by Brotha Lynch Hung."
4,Southwest Voodoo,"Insane Clown Posse. Those three words bring about a lot of hatred from people. I myself, feel the contempt for their fans, not their music. I like ICP and the Great Milenko immensely. It's a great rap album with rock sounds infused, and it's got some nice lyricism and symbolism. The words aren't university influenced and the flow is not the best in all of the world, but it gets the job done. The beats are good, the words and beats intertwined are great, so I find nothing wrong with the album."
1,Complete Crap!,"Oh... God... I cant even being to imagine how this piece of crap band even got popular. People have really lost their taste in music. I cant express how much I hate this ... ""group"" ...I listened to a song from them (dont ask me which one, because I dont really care), and I -HATED- how he just repeated ""If you dont like me then you can f--k off.""I dont see how people can enjoy this. For one, clowns arent even funny, and two, THEY CANT FECKING SING!Please, avoid this garbage completely..."
1,My ears have now become numb.,"Well, folks, here's a great cd made by two homosexual freaks whoenjoy being stupid. Yep, that about sums it up.Clown makeup and weird cd covers don't make popularity increase,but most likely decrease. I'm not even sure what to call this abominationof music - Is it rap? Is it rock? Is it pop? No, the answer is most likely that it is simply useless, mind numbing garbage that needs to stop beingmade popular. To say they suck is like saying Ashly sinpson can sing badly. It basically doesn't even come close to what really should be said. Here's what ICP should stand for : Idiotic Cocky Posers."
1,Humanity: beg forgivness and maybe ICP will go away...,"I cannot in good taste, and in keen intelligence, and in good judgment, and in proper reason, and in firm faith, and in all fairness, and in genuine truth, and in popular opinion, and in personal conviction, and in all honesty find any or a million ways the audacity or courage to reccomend this vile worthless turd of a so-called album to you, dear reader. Before you are tainted any further at the dillema of giving your mind the precious grace to ponder upon buying this witless disc, I suggest you run like hell and go buy a rap act duo with actual talent, taste, intelligence, wit and musical ability to spare: OUTKAST. Go buy it now, here at Amazon!RUN,DEAR READER! RUN AWAY FROM THE CANCER THAT IS ICP!(It's a cryin' shame that I can't post any negative star ratings:("
1,Childish and obscene,"I've listened to many of the songs on almost all of the cds, so I feel that I know what I'm talking about. A friend of mine owns them all and he introduced me to them. I love the different sounds and beats in all the songs, but that is all I have to say for their music. The lyrics are perverse, Very explict, and lack any imagination whatsoever. The music is very entertaining and fits the lyrics-somewhat. My friend no longer listens to them because he has outgrown and gotten tired of listening to their raging about cutting, dicing, and shooting people. There is no reality to any of their songs. I have nothing against owning or listening to meaningless cds every now and then, but the stuff contained in these cds is full of rage and immaturaty. All of the cds have nothing better to offer than some interesting notes thrown together. Why waste the money on poor lyrics when you can find a cd that offers both good music and lyrics? Definetly not worth purchasing."
5,You Wanna Know Why I Like Rap?,"This cd is the reason that I like rap. I'm not a big fan of all the swearing, but there is something about these guys that is just unbelievably awesome. I'm sure that there is a message behind all the lyrics and I'm sure it's a good one. These guys are friggin awesome!"
5,This CD is why im a Juggalo,"I hated rap and only listened to the hardest, fastest, loudest Metal i could find. My friend had to literally sneak up on me while i was playin halo and slap headphones on me knowing i couldnt take em off in the middle of a match. I let House of Horrors play out and asked him to put it on the stereo. It was over from there. ICP has opened me to a vast array of music since then. Knowing that I can go from Cannibal Corpse to ICP, Marilyn Manson to Eminem, i went even further and have a vast appreciation for all types of music. I credit this album with that gift. Motha Phukc what all yall say! its my motherchuckin review, bloe deez nizzles. MMFWCL!"
4,Great CD for ICP Fans,"Insane Clown Posse- Great MilenkoGreat Milenko has to be one of my favorite Insane Clown Posse CDs. The band of Violent J and Shaggy 2 Dope can be very hit and miss; this album is a hit though. The songs diversify fairly well along the ride. You can have fast paced songs angry at abusive husbands like ""Hall of Illusions."" You can also get a slow song about life like ""How Many Times."" I personally prefer the faster songs, but the others are nice. My favorite song on this album would have to be ""Piggy Pie.""Most Insane Clown Posse fans already own this. If you are a fan of their work and do not own this, check out Great Milenko as soon as you can. If you are new to the Juggalo (what their fans call themselves) nation, proceed into this album with caution. It is not for everyone. There is excessive swearing and nonsensical lyrics. The CD is made for a fun day though, not for those looking for music with deep meaning."
1,terrible,This album is horrible!!! They talk about doing mean things and have very foul language! I would sudgest to all the parents not to let there kids get this!
2,It was o.k.,"For some reason, in my opinion, this was the worst one. None of the songs really jumped up at me. I was almost bored through some of it. I love ICP, but not this album. I haven't heard them all yet, but so far, all of the other ones are better than this.My Favorites That I Have In OrderThe Wraith: Shangri-LaRiddle BoxCarnival Of CarnageThe Great Milenko"
3,IMPROVING,"I like ICP and their newer work. I mean I thought the Carnival of carnage sucked balls, i thought that the riddle box sucked balls, and i thought the ring master sucked balls. Everysong is so dark and boring, all the same. I think from this point (Great Melinko) on they started to vary their songs and make them different. Also More Lively, Better Lyrics. pretty much after Violent J started smoking weed their music got better. I thought the Amazing Jeckel Brothers was an outstanding album with alot of variety and some good lyrics and good rapping. also the Wraith: Shangri la was amazingly by far their greatest album ever created. definetely i would go pick those 2 up if you havnt all0 ready and look out in early august 2004 the new Wraith: Hells Pit is coming out.. hopefully its as good as the first Wraith. but this cd is one u burn so burn it."
5,ONE OF THERE BEST!,"Intro - Tells you a little about MilenkoThe Great Milenko - Good Song, nice lyrics! Tells more about milenkoHokus Pokus - Typical ICP Song, NICE!Piggy Pie - Starts weird but is really good, freaky lyricsHow Many Times - Repetive after awhile but goodSouthwest Voodoo - Good beats nice lyrics!Halls of Illusions - Good beats weird yet typical lyricsUnder the Moon - Nice! i like it alotWhat is a Juggalo - This is probaboly my favorite song on the CD funny yet somehow scarry........House of Horrors - Typical ICP Song it real goodBoogie Woogie Wu - Good....kinda scarryNeden Game - Good.......but gets old fastHellajuhah - good but to much skitsDown With the Clown - Good FunnyJust like that - Funny & WeirdPass Me By - Real good ending songMCL![.]Anyone who aint down wit the clown DONT BE A JUGGAH@E"
5,The 4th emerges....,"Alice Cooper's warning sets the tone for what many consider to be the best ICP album. While it is a great album, It doesn't beat out the Carnival of Carnage which is, in MHO, the best jokers card. ICP's style is steal as real as ever. this isn't music for your moms but thats ok cuz it's made for the juggalos and they are the ones who'll love it... check out Under the Moon, What is a juggalo, How many times, Down with the Clown, and pass me by. I'm out like the Wraith on november 5th, peace and mcl juggalos"
5,ICP at their best,This CD is great. ICPs best jokers card. This album along with Riddle Box are some of the best rap CDs I have ever heard. All the songs on it are great. Be sure to roll down all the windows in your car and play it real loud for everyone to hear! Down with the Clown 4 life!!!!
1,Can You Even Consider This Music?,"Garbage, total grabage. I have a friend who is a big ""juggalo"", and he burned me a copy of this CD, and the minute ""What Is A Juggalo"" started to play on my stero I knew I had found the worst music ever. Every single song sucks, the rappers sound like retards, the lyrics are incredibly stupid, with no good musicianship to make up for this. The only good thing about ICP is that they are catchy, which makes them even worse. I found ""Southwest Voodoo"" stuck in my head the whole day after I heard the album, which sucks. I literally felt like drilling a hole through my head. ICP sucks, do not listen to them."
5,GREAT MILENKO IS AWESOME!,"ok...my boyfriend and i have been together for 2 years and ever single day sence we have been together we walk to school well now drive to school and listen to I.C.P and Great Milenko. I LOVE THEM BOTH people are crazy who say that they are crappy and that the only people who listen to them are losers just because of the music they listen to, you would have to know the person before you know if they are a loser or not but maybe it is just me but i love them to death auctually my boyfriend and i are going to I.C.P's concert the 22nd of march."
5,Mike of Cali,"This Cd was a gret mix of rip metal and rap. The lyrics foucus on destroying rednecks, rich folks and politics. You have to listen hard but the lyrics are funny as hell when you get down to the core of them. One of my favorite tracks is ""Boogy Woogy Wu"" where the singer places himself in the mind of the all too famous Boogie man. He explains explicitly about killing kids in their sleep... Good stuff. It may sound disturbing but it is incredibly funny. There are all sorts of clown and carnevil sounds in this Cd. I'm sure you will never forget the sinister laughing clown in ""The great Milenko"" track. I hope you enjoy this Cd as much as I did."
3,Not as comprehensive as other guides on topic,This is a reasonably good book with handy tips not covered in other guides to Palm / Pilot handhelds but it is not the best guide if you are buying only one.
3,Both found here,A few standout tracks can make this quirky indie release appear more thorough than it is.
2,Whole is Less than the Sum of its Parts,"Certainly not the worst album of the last couple of years, but extremely forgettable. Is there a single great song on here? Absolutely not. I'd be hard pressed to say there is even a good song. The closest is probably Rotten Hell. None of the songs is awful, but this is one of those cases where a collection of fair to middling songs adds up to a disposable album. If you want something that will hold your interest, forget Menomena and try something like Silversun Pickups, Snow Patrol, or Arcade Fire."
3,"Fun at first, loses it quickly","You might love this stuff at first, but the looping technique of making music results in a loss of that essential magic. This is music via computer, and you can tell."
5,"Forget Album of the Year, this is Album of the Past Half-Decade","Menomena has created, in the simplest of terms, a masterpiece. Each and every song has so much power, it gives me goosebumps when I listen to Friend and Foe. What makes this album so groundbreaking is how they effectively make music unable to be under your norm set of musical genres. Believe me, they go everywhere, but they do it in a constrained sort of way of experimentation, they don't overdo anything so rather than going beyond musical boundaries, they creatively craft new ones. And don't think that because of how ""unique"" the music is, that it'll be inaccessible, in fact, it's quite the opposite, I really can't imagine someone really hating this music. Impossible! Friend and Foe is the best album in the past 5 years, maybe longer."
4,"""Impressions"" Are Impressive, ""Windows"" Could Be Better","Simons's interpretation of ""Church Windows"" is inferior to López-Cobos's. He doesn't let the French Horns explode at the end with their ostinato figure. On the flip side, his more intimate and evocative interpretation of ""Brazilian Impressions"" stands out far beyond López-Cobos. So the thing to do is get a download of López-Cobos's CW and Simons's BI, and enjoy the best of both worlds.Thank the heavens for music downloads, like the Internet, saving this great music!"
1,Poor Packaging,"CMT makes an excellent router bit but Amazon can't ship it safely. I ordered 2 bits and both were damaged from poor packaging. I asked Amazon to send replacements in better packaging and they too arrived damaged.Again, I will continue to buy CMT bits but they definately won't come from Amazon."
1,Adds nothing to the subject matter.,This book is nothing but a series of third version accounts based on other people's work. Almost no footnotes and many factual errors.
2,Disappointed.,"The other reviews lead me to believe this book was necessary for any kitchen, that it would be a true ""inspiration"" for cooking. Not so. It is dry & boring like other textbooks. This is a college textbook. Don't let anyone else believe that it is anything else other than that."
3,"Quick payment, prompt delivery, great merchandise, A ++++!","The best chapter in the book by far is ""Hitler was a Vegetarian,"" which is on the accomanying CD-ROM. In this historic recording, author Max Judge (brother of Beavis and Butthead creator) gives a gripping account of this little-known chapter in Military History! Highly recommended."
5,Great Toy,This is a great bedtime toy he sings the kid a lullaby and glows and then they can go to sleep together. My daughter who is 3 got a bedtime uniqua for her birthday and my son who is 1 kept stealing it so we got him the bedtime pablo for Christmas and now he doesnt go to bed without it I would definatly recommend this toy
5,Classic Brazilian Music,"This CD represents the finest music Brazil has to offer. If you love the happy upbeat rythms of Brazil, you will love this CD. Jobim is an icon."
5,A superb compilation.,"This CD is one of the best I own. Antonio Carlos Jobim was amaster songwriter; each song is charming and of the highest quality.I'm especially fond of Astrud Gilberto's vocals in three of the songs -- her accent is just lovely. Some of my favorite jazz singers (Sarah Vaughan, Shirley Horn and Ella Fitzgerald) also lend their voices to Jobim's songs. Jobim has a way of unobtrusively energizing the listener, making his music a splendid choice for just about any occasion."
5,Love it!,"Love this! It's part bossa nova, kind of jazzy. Takes me to a beach with white sands and clear blue water, exactly where I want to be at this time of the year."
5,"Wonderful, brought back great memories of this great music!",Clear and clean music that makes one remember an era when music was composed! (no offense to music composed since) Those are the words that best decribe a feelin' that this music gives - it's MUSIC!!
2,Avoid this disc!!,"Antonio Carlos Jobim is the preminent master of bossanova jazz, and this CD does him no justice. It is a tribute album to Jobim that I would only buy if it was the last Cd I needed for my collection. A few tracks such as #5 and #1 stand out, but after that these artist did him more of a disservice by making this below-average tribute.DO NOT BUY!!"
2,Sold it,"After playing Ubi Soft Sudoku this game doesn't come close, the controls are not conducive to smooth game play. The gaming screen is very small the developers did not take advantage of the PSP's large screen. Don't even think of playing mahjong the tiles are tiny. Also when you flip to Black in playing chess, Black stays on the top! When you play checkers, you have to jump all the pieces; you cannot hold back a piece for strategic position. When you create the jigsaw puzzle you have to keep manipulating the background color on the different boards so that you can place the necessary pieces. Yeah you get what you pay for."
2,Good start but needs work!,"All of the write ups I saw before I bought this game neglected to say what games were included but I bought any way. The games are broken down to 5 catagories: ALL TIME FAVORITES (Backgammon, Checkers, Chess, Chinese Checkers, Reversi) WORDS & NUMBERS (Anagrams, Dice, Kakuro, Sudoku, Word Cubes) PUZZEL GAMES (Concentration, Enigma, Jigsaws, Mahjong) FAMILY FAVORITS (3-D Tic-Tac-Toe, Naval Battle, Parcheesi, Quattro, Snakes and Ladders) STRATEGY GAMES (Dominoes, Go, Mancala, Gomoku, Shogi). In addition to having a lot of obscure games the game is not very intutive. It is difficult to figure out how to get help or get to the tutor mode. The font that is used plus the colors (font and background) make it difficult to read in places. The scoring on some games is different to what I am used to (i.e. dominos) and different from Hoyle's board games (PC/MAC) and so far I have not found a way to adjust change the scoring."
4,ULTIMATE BOARD GAME COLLECTION,DOES NOT SUCK YOU IN LIKE OTHER GAMES AND THATS GOOD IF YOU HAVE SOME TIME TO KILL AND DON'T WANT TO GET CAOUGHT UP IN THE MIDDDLE OF A GAME.
3,"Nice, but unsafe?","We purchased a set of the 222 Fifth Avenue Arabian Flower dishes, and they were indeed pretty. The glaze looks hand-painted, although there are some imperfections too. Our biggest concern is with microwave use. When we used one of the plates to heat up some food in the microwave, the food was cold, but the plate was too hot to touch! A similar thing happened with one of the coffee cups - the handle became scorching hot (something we don't experience with other dishes in the microwave)."
2,Information not worth the money.,Not really indepth for the price. The whole series should cost what it does for just one.
4,One day of good fun,My 5 year old daughter received this gift for Christmas. She and her 8 year old sister enjoyed decorating the butterflies and getting them ready to hang in their bedroom. The kit had everything they needed (and more) to make their butterflies look the way they wanted. They had a great time doing something creative together. :)
1,Not the real deal,"Note that the band shown as a companion product is not the same band that uses the 90538 replacement pods. The old 90518 band was discontinued and I have not been able to find replacement pods for it. I ordered what were supposed to be replacement pods for this from Ace but I received pods for the current model which are useless with the old band. The picture on the Ace site and here shows the 90538 pods with the blue stem but they are sending out 90537 pods instead, which have a hole and no stem making them useless for the old style band."
1,DO NOT BUY!,As per the other review here - the pods they ship are not as pictured. They have no peg to fit in the headband and will not work.
5,A wonderful help to understanding Rashi,"The Silberman translation is a tremendous help especially for those of us who have difficulty with Rashi script. It is a wonderful learning tool, and enabled me to learn more Rashi than I could by puzzling myself over the original."
4,Great toy,"My 2 1/2 year old son loves this toy. It has a display screen that shows which letter you push and says the name of the letter. I got this toy because he loved my daughter's disney princess laptop. THey are similar in that there is a keyboard and a display screen as well as sound. There are some games also, but he is too little to understand them. HE just likes the keyboard and the alphabet. I think it's a good learning toy for him."
5,Best thing I ever bought for my son!,I got this laptop for my son for his 3rd birthday. He learned how to do it so fast. He now knows how to spell/read all of the words on it. He didn't need any help to use it. I wish that they would come out with one that has more words and harder words on it. It is amazing.
1,dont buy this laptop!!!!,"This toy is a waist of money, dont bother with it. When I seen it I walked away. It dont play games, and it is Not a colored screen. This toy is miss leading & this biggest waist of money!!!!!"
1,White supremacists will love the book.,"The first thing I noticed about this book is that on the first page therewas a drawing of a bird-headed Egyptian diety, and the masonic symbol. SinceI see free masonry as conflicting with Scriptures, I suspected the book wasnot the Scripturally based book I'd hope it was when I ordered it. Withinjust a few pages the author started giving her belief that there was a pre-Adamicrace of subhuman beings and that they were black. I did not find herBible verse back up, nor her archaeological back up, for such beliefs tobe justifiable. But if you like believing that because your skin hasless pigment in it than others, that you are therefore a superior being,you will probably enjoy this book very much."
3,Nostalgia Time,"If you're a fan of the old school pulp paperbacks, you might enjoy this 1965 novel from author Carter Brown. Telling the story of a tv writer who finds himself stranded on an island with seven other people (one of whom might be a murderer), this novel is full of hard-boiled dialogue, politically incorrect commentary, cynical men, sexy femme fatales, and purple prose. Carter Brown was one of the more prolific authors of this type of fiction and he keeps you reading even as it becomes obvious that he's pretty much just making up the plot as he goes along. It helps that Brown also includes a lot of intentional humor that helps the reader digest the implausible plot. This book is a perfect example of a style of fiction that we don't really see much of anymore and, as an unapologetic lover of the old pulp paperbacks that you would buy at bus stops and airports, I thoroughly enjoyed it."
1,Disappointment,My husband is a collector and this was a gift I bought him and I am so very disappoited! The product was jammed into a US postal box and because of that the box that the collectable comes in is now all banged up on the edges! Therefor now the collector value is now lower because of the damage. The person who sold it really should know better how to package a collectable and not try saving money by jamming it in to a box that does not properly fit! On top of it I paid for shipping! And thats what I got! That is the last time I order any collectable from here!Hot Wheels Classics Snake & Mongoose VW Drag Bus Race Set
5,very useful book,"As a practicing physical therapist I always tend to increase my abilities in the field.This book gives anybody interested in orthopaedic/manual medicine the extended knowledge about how to examine and treat patients with motion apparatus' problems.Some says that Cyriax's point of view on manual therapy was very controversive but there had been nobody who trained so many famous therapists as he did.The book,its containess,should be considered an esensive complement of education in the orthopaedic and manual therapy's field.I reccomend!"
2,clever idea but old fast,All of the faces contain the name of the kids. This is clever the first few times you read it but it get's old fast. We haven't read it in months.
3,pleasing,With all the gloomy movies out there embroiled in their problems it is refreshing to come across one with a pleasing humour and underlying gladness throughout without falling into A Comedy. The film seemed to move slower2/3 way throgh and lost its pace .Then it felt too long for the content. However the ride was uplifting and relaxing.
4,knurling in the wrong place,"The optical quality of this filter blows away every other Polarizer I own, however why is the knurling on the edge and not the front? you can't get a grip on the damn thing when you have a hood on. And when you use a polarizer, you're in good sunlight, and need a hood. I stick a finger inside the hood to adjust the polarizer, and I just can't get a descent grip on this thing sometimes.This a major flaw on a damn good polarizer.optical quality 10+ergonomics 2So close to a perfect product"
1,Terrible Quality Photo,"Using on a Nikon D3S. I'm a Hoya user and took a chance on the Nikon thinking - it's a Nikon, it must be better!. Wrong. Terrible photographs, no clarity, loss of focus, over saturation of colors. I'll never use this again. Do yourself a favor, spend the money, stick with Hoya."
2,Good But!,"This polarizer works so I am not going to touch on its aspects of it taking good photos. What I want to explain is its construction.This filter is slim, slimmer than my other filters by 2-3 mm which is significant with ultra wide lenses. The one disappointing aspect is that the adjustment ring is flimsy, not its construction but when you use any touch will change the adjustment ring. The polarizing filters I had in the past had rings that took a bit more effort to turn but also they didn't feel like if you antecedently touch the filter the adjustment ring would turn.I would have liked to say that this was due to a bad batch or I got a defected one but I bought two (one for my friend) and they both feel the same way.Maybe this is a ""feature"" desired by people but certainly not myself."
3,a little expensive for what you get,Not bad - Not great. A little expensive for what you get. Not the seller's fault. Not sure there is a better option for the money.
5,Great product great service,"I think I almost always begin these reviews complaining about the price, that is just me. The product is outstanding, the price reasonable, and the service outstanding. I am still amazed by the great Amazon process."
3,Disappointed,"I bought this polarizing filter to use on my Nikon 24-70 mm f2.8 lens and while I think it is superbly constructed, I admit to being disappointed by the results. Other reviews talk of the filter bringing out the blue sky and making colors pop. But, I find the differences so subtle that I'm actually having trouble using the filter. While I can see subtle - and desirable - differences when I view pics on the computer, it is very difficult to see the effect when composing thru-the-lens and while viewing the pic on the camera's display. That has also led me to wish that the filter had setting marks that could be used to determine just how it is set. Instead, the outer lens can be rotated infinitely, and, without the ability to really see what's happening thru-the-lens, results are hit and miss. One other slight complaint is that I find it can be difficult to unscrew the filter from the lens since the outer ring turns, making it necessary to try and grasp the very fine inner ring."
1,"Impossible, but doesn't filter the reflexions","I got it in time, nice, everything is OK - except I see myself in any glass surface like before. For all that I twisted the filter in all position at any 1/8 inch."
2,Disappointed.,"First of all, I originally ordered the M/L size and when it arrived, it was gigantic. WAY too large, so I had to go through the process of returning and reordering a smaller size. It would be very helpful if the description gave more sizing information. I am 5'7 and 175 lbs and the S/M is STILL almost too large. Furthermore, the material picks up everything! Pet hair, dirt, leaves...anything that seems like it could stick to the fabric will. And it's difficult to try to pick all that stuff off. Finally, I have really dry skin, so anywhere there is rougher skin (my hands, feet, sometimes legs) the material will snag and catch and it's really annoying. I tried to wear it for a few days, but it's so uncomfortable and I'm going to try to sell it on eBay or something. Very disappointed."
3,I was okay.,"I was thought it would have more of the sports superstars in it, but for the most part it was a good and funny video."
4,Systematics put into Perspective,"Not necessarily just the authors point on the subject of systematics. Schuh provides an objective look at the classification of a taxon and the fundemental basis for understanding such endevors. Although the disagreements of other scientists in the subject area becomes overwhelming, Schuh provides a well written technical look at what is involved in systematics. Surely not intended for a novice in the subject area of biology."
2,Biological Systematics?,"I added the ""?"" as this is very much an account of the narrow cladistic-phylogenetic approach to a vast subject, so the title could be misleading. Not a book for a biologist wanting to understand systematics, but rather a text for a graduate student working with such approaches."
2,The Points is the Jam/ The Rest Not So good,"The main song is called, ""The Points"" it features alot of great MC's The Notorious B.I.G., Busta Rhymes, Bone Thugs N Harmony and more. The rest of the cd is not that good. I looked for the Points on itunes or amazon Mp3 and couldn't find it, so it was worth spending $0.50 and getting that great track."
4,Awe Those Childhood Memories!,This is really a great book for the Baby Boomer Generation! I have a super time just looking at all the childhood toys that I had totally forgotten existed. My Favorites are from the 1960's! If you are a Chatty Cathy collecctor then this is a Must Have book....Her Sears ads are in here!
3,A challenging classic,"P.D. James mentioned this book in her study of mystery fiction. It's set in an early era of London and the language is a bit archaic though intriguing. Allingham is quite a stylist, and her characters are unique in a Dickensian way."
3,Not bad,"Unusual characters who seem to do inexplicable actions. A fun read, but rather odd characters and occupations and emotions. a"
5,A Permanent Cure,"We purchased this book for my husband, who had a headache that lasted for four months. MRIs, Cat Scans, pain killers, muscle relaxants - nothing worked. Within 2 weeks of following this program to the letter, his headache was gone. He has since added a number of things back into his diet, as it appears that caffeine and MSG are his headache triggers. Now the only time he gets a headache is when we eat out somewhere that uses MSG - we've found that many restaurants put MSG on salad vegetables. In addition to eliminating the chronic headache, this book has also taught us about food additives and how to search for and avoid toxic additives. Thank you, Dr Buchholz!"
4,Heal your headaches,Easy read. Makes sense though the author seems a bit arrogant. Then again if he has seen all that the book contains and more and has helped many with his method then so be it. I suffer from chronic migraine and am going to remove the item from the 123 program that I h ave not already and hopefully I t will give me better control too. I fall I not the group that needs a preventive medication daily .
5,2 years of daily headache cured,I started getting daily headache/migraine after a surgery. After 2 years of going to doctors all around and being in patient for 12 days at the Diamond Clinic in Chicago I finally got this book recommended. I have followed every step 100% and am down to 4 headaches a month using no 'quick' fixes... I have gotten my life back. THANK YOU!!!! I wish more doctors knew this book existed.
5,Relief - Finally!,"Heal Your Headache provided me the long-awaited relief I needed from my chronic headaches. I had headaches every day for over a year, and fought them consistently for well over ten years. Upon reading this book, I finally felt that there was medical support for my problem, at a time that I felt abandoned by my local system of doctors. I often suspected various foods, such as aspartame, caffeine or MSG, but I could never confirm it. By following Dr. Buchholz's recommendations, I finally got relief. One of the most enlightening items for me was how many foods I used in daily life that actually had MSG in them, including chicken broth, frozen meals, and most flavored snack foods. In addition, I had built up an addiction to over-the-counter pain relievers. It takes courage and determination to actually follow the guidelines, but the outcome is life-changing. This book is a ""must-read"" for anyone suffering from persistent headaches."
5,Real help for people with migraines,"If you or someone you know suffers from migraines, then you likely know the frustration that comes from trying to find information that is clear, practical, and consistent. Dr. David Buchholz' book is exactly that: clear, practical and consistent. He is honest without being condescending, explaining migraines in a way that really makes sense, and offering practical and effective help. It is clear that he listens to his patients; the respect that is conveyed is refreshing. The explanations of how one's triggers and migraine threshold level are intertwined was especially helpful. For the first time, I was able to understand how food triggers work and why it is so important to follow the migraine diet. I enthusiastically recommend this book - it can make a tremendous difference in your life."
5,Challenging approach to a headache,The doctor seems to know what he is talking about. I feel like I am reading my life story and need to take his advice!
4,Very Informative,I learned so much about what was causing my headaches and what I can do. I also realized that many of my random symptoms where migraine related.
4,Migraine madness,"This book, while I haven't done all the steps exactly, yet, has given me a lot of information to get me started on a new perspective of why I have on-going headaches and how to reduce them. And so far, even with the small changes I have incorporated into my life, the headaches have become less and less. I recommend anyone with re-occuring headaches to read this book. It will help to sort out the confusion that comes with so many headaches and led you to a conclusion that makes more sense than what even your doctor(s) can tell you. Good luck!"
5,Changed My Life,"If you are serious about getting to the crux of your headaches and are willing to make some sacrifices, read this book. Inititally it was pretty daunting for me as essentially everything on the list of trigger foods included foods I had been eating daily. I must say that giving up coffee and chocolate (particularly hard over my birthday-Valentine's day) was HARD!! I rediscovered the joy of cooking, realizing I had been buying too many prepared meals. Once I got into the groove of knowing what I had to avoid, it was easy to find lots of great tasting, and some new foods as well. Bonus- I lost 7 lbs!I can't remember feeling better. I am 2 months into the elimination and I think for me, caffeine is probably the real problem child. I feel much less anxious, less irritable and am sleeping better than I have in years. This book changed my life. I'm passing it on!!"
5,Excellent headache help,"This book was easy to understand and gave practical advice on how to help and/or get rid of your headaches. Things your doctor may have told you but not in detail (so it wasn't helpful or helping). The book expands on WHAT to do and WHY, which helps when trying anything for your health. I've been working the steps and feel better so far. I've been a migraine sufferer for 20 years (seeing doctors and on medication). It's worth the read and the try if you are a headache sufferer."
5,"So Far, So Good","I have been getting migraines for 17 years and this book described my problems to a ""T"": The migraine sufferer who begins with smaller headaches than can be easily controlled to snowballing and getting worse and worse as you are put on a long line of medications. I began the program a little over two weeks ago and although it is daunting (and hard to find food!) at times, I am already feeling so much better. It is scary to give up your medications and trust that you can help control your pain, but once you are doing it, it is scary to see that you waited so long!"
5,Relief!,"The advice in Heal Your Headache 1-2-3 has helped my husband, who has been a headache sufferer since childhood---these headaches occurred more than once/week for about 40 years. We learned that he consumed many of the headache triggers and that a good night's sleep is essential! My husband still gets headaches, but the frequency, intensity and duration have lessened significantly. This book is an easy read and a good reference. Thank you, Dr. Buchholz!"
5,Heal Your Headache,"FIRST AND FOREMOST, THIS REALLY WORKS! BUY THE BOOK AND GIVE IT TO YOUR FRIENDS WHO SUFFER WITH HEADACHES! Dr. Bucholz explains triggers and one's response to them in easy to understand terms. My daughter suffered from daily migraines for 4 years, seeing her internist, pain specialist, infection control physician, accupuncturist, chiropractor, dentist--all to no avail. Once she followed these recommendations, she saw improvements in small ways quickly and within a couple of months, NO MORE HEADACHES! At first the restrictions seem overwhelming, but it truly is manageable. When you have lived with this kind of pain--it's nice to know that you can control certain triggers and find relief. Dr. explains the process very well and gives you all the information you need to follow the plan. The key is to follow it. Read and study it! Best of health to you!"
3,Always in pain,"I have read this book twice. The first time I tried the diet I eventually stopped since my preventative medication was working quite well. Unfortunetely, it made me gain a lot of weight so I wanted to get off of it. I've been doing the diet for over a month now w/no success. I was already on a very strict low calorie diet in addition to being a vegetarian so this diet limits me even more. My number of headaches hasn't yet to decrease but I'm still hopeful it may work soon. I get about 15migraines a month & every year it gets worse. My ideal would be to not have to take a preventative but it looks like that isn't in my cards. I wish he detailed more of the preventatives & their side effects as there as many."
3,book has missing pages and repeated chapters,my copy of the book has repeated chapters (ch 7 and 8 are in in twice) but the bigger issue is it goes from page 104 to 137. where is 105- 136? please send me a correct copy! i have never seen this before in a book. The book is good from what i see and i want to be able to read the entire thing.thanks.
2,Not all headaches are migraine as the author would have you believe,"I read this book a couple of years ago when the migraine medications that I was taking didn't work. After reading the book, I was certain that it must be something in my diet that was triggering migraines.The book is plain misleading. Not all headaches are migraine and cannot be effectively treated with migraine medications. I learned this the long, hard, painful way. It wasn't until I read another book, ""The Headache Cure"" by Kandel & Sudderth, that I realized I suffered from cervicogenic headaches, not migraine.Please do yourself a favor. If you suffer from daily, chronic headaches, read The Headache Cure. If you are 100% certain you have migraine, then ""Heal Your Headache"" may offer you some relief."
3,"A ""Cafeteria"" Book","Dr. Buchholz makes some excellent points in this book. However, he also makes statements that fly in the face of vast amounts of medical evidence as well as my personal experience and that of patients I work with. That doesn't, however, negate the good sections of the book. Consider it a ""cafeteria"" book. Take what works for you, and leave the rest."
4,Read This Book!,"This book was very informative. It helped me understand migraines. It has easy to understand concepts. It is an easy and quick read. If you have headaches, you should read this book."
5,Healed at Last!,"Dear Dr. Buchholz,I can't begin to thank you for your book. Aftertrying ""everything"" I've now gone one month without aheadache using the 1-2 program. I feel like I'm ""me""again.I was getting 3-day headaches 2-3 times/month for thepast 3 years. I'm 38 years old and in great health.I tried acupuncture, acupressure, massages,chiropratic, N.A.E.T, birth control pills and ofcourse various meds. A friend saw you on TV and toldme about your book. I was reluctant to try ""one morething,"" but wow - I'm sure glad I did!!!Tomorrow will be my first full month in 3 yearswithout a headache. Your book is nothing short of ablessing in my life. I couldn't let another minute goby without expressing my heartfelt thanks!Wishing you continued success with your book - I'msharing it with everyone I know.All the best, Karyn"
5,This Book Will Change Your Life For The Better,"Several years ago, I suddenly started suffering from migraines. I went to neurologist after neurologist, and none of them were able to help me - actually they just made my symptoms worse. I had no control over my life, and became hopeless that I would ever be OK again. My wife bought this book for me, which I thought was going to be another waste of time, but I thumbed through it to please her...and instantly discovered it to hit all the nails on the head. I was amazed at the way it dealt directly with ALL of my symptoms. I read it cover to cover that day - I was unable to put it down. After following Dr. Buchholz's advice for a few weeks, I was able to reign in the symptoms and get my life under control again...and am able to keep it that way year after year. I honestly don't know where my life would be right now if it weren't for this book - I can't praise it enough."
5,Book worked for me,"The book/diet worked for me and I recommend at least trying it. But you really have to follow the Dr. and the diet in order for it to work. (Again, it may notwork for everyone but in order for you to find that out, you really have to follow it.) It was hard but when I was headache free for the first time in literally 6 years,that was motivation enough."
1,three big errors,"It would have been an excellent book if it was not for three truly major mistakes that will lead many people astray. 1. There is no scientific evidence but only anecdotal reports that triptans, such as imitrex cause rebound headaches and limiting patients to only two days of treatment with triptans per month is a crime! 2. Botox has completely relieved migraines in thousands of patients. There is not a single major headache center that does not offer this treatment. 3. Magnesium and feverfew have been proven to prevent migraines in multiple double-blind trials published in major medical journals, which cannot be said for many of the drug recommendations in the book."
2,disappointed,I didn't learn any new information from reading this book...I was very hopeful that this book would be able to help me...this book offered very little new information...I knew all this just from basic research I have done online or from other books I have read...a real waste of money!!
4,I've been headache free for a couple months now!!!,"I read this books and another one here at Amazon titled ""Your Body's Many Cries for Water."" Since I've been drinking more fresh water each day, switched my multivitamin to WIN-Daily, and read these books, I've been headache free - something long sought after.Get this book and search here for the other one I mentioned."
1,Didn't heal my headache,"This book is well written and an enjoyable read. Cutting out all the foods he recommends is difficult and not taking any painkillers is difficult. However, it would have been worth it if it had worked but I didn't even notice a slight decrease in the number of migraines I suffered. Quite allot of people here have said it has worked for them so it's worth giving it a go but it certainly didn't work for me!"
4,informative but arrogant,"The book provides a nice summary of strategies for migraine with an emphasis on diet and cautions about reliance on increasing doses and potency of drugs. However, the author summarily dismisses all who disagree,stating controlled studies are not to be believed and backing himself up with testimonials that read like infomercials. He also dismisses any notion that reducing life stress can be a factor in not reaching migraine threshold, deeming this impossible to do. He provides scant evidence that everything from oranges to walnuts raises migraine threshold. And he lets tobacco off he hook for some idiosyncratic reason.All that said, the concept of multiple causes leading to threshold and clear explanations of what drugs do and cannot do (including cause rebound headaches) makes the book worth reading. In addition, his doctors are human and get frustrated lesson is helpful, as migraines are often tough to control and both patient and doctor get frustrated."
4,deal with migraines,Very focused way to deal with migraines if you're having trouble finding an answer and have tried all else. It is an older book however. It is worth reading if all else has failed or you are looking for a different option. Deals a lot with dietary triggers. Don't get this book if you aren't willing to drastically change your diet.
5,Brilliant,"Wowzers, this album is something else. Half layered spoken word, half actual ""music."" I would highly highly recommend it to those who are sick of standard music and want something not just outside the realms of rock or pop or jazz or whathaveyou, but for those who want something outside the realms of music as you know it. Very tongue in cheek, very entertaining, very very awesome. 4 1/2 stars"
5,"Enchanting, Magical","I have never owned an album of Celtic music before, and claim no expertise in the genre. One thing I do know is how captivated I was by the beauty of this collection. The rich voices and excellent interpretations of the three soloists, combined with the arrangements, instrumentation and hauntingly beautiful songs made this immediately one of my favorite albums ever.I cannot help but wonder if I have a defective copy, however. Track #7, which is supposed to be Irish Lullaby, sung by Sarah Moore, actually is Marie's Wedding, by John St. John, from the original set. No reviewer has mentioned it. I'm not complaining - I love the track, possibly above all of the others. But what a strange mistake!"
3,Great scenery,"This is a great ride with fantastic scenery but only ok music. Obviously music is a very personal thing but I don't find that the tunes on this ride amp me up like the tunes on his other rides. BUT and this is a fair and balanced ""But"" the scenery on this ride is Georgeous and breathtakingly beautiful.Good exercise and fun ride for middle of a snowy day when your bored to tears on your indoor trainer."
1,Not what I expected,"When I bought this, since it was listed as 1.27 pounds of quercetin-- and from the description that was listed at the time-- I thought this was product was loose & not in capsules.Not the case. The bottle weighed about 6 ounces when I got it-- maybe less-- since it was a measly 60 capsules of Quercetin. I would have returned it, but hubby broke the seal & started taking them. It's a decent product-- but their description is misleading."
1,"Not the same ""fresh"" scent","I specifically ordered Speed Stick ""Fresh"" scent, with the green lid as pictured, but instead I received a silver lid ""POWER"" Speed Stick which smells way too unmanly. My adorable husband has been wearing the same antiperspirant for the 21 years of our relationship (and then some), and I like how he smells.Why mess with success?Green Lid, please.I am returning my product and will go on a stock-up spree at local retailers."
1,Not what I ordered,"I was specifically looking for ""fresh scent"" and received one from the ""Power"" line. I don't like it, and was trying to receive something different."
1,Upset plea from UK,"No, no, no, no, no! I have been using this for years, shipped to the UK, as it's a fresh clean scent, what am I going to do now as all the others smell toxic and aggressive if that's possible. Come on Colgate, what's up with you?"
1,Not the Product Pictured; BUYER BEWARE,"The product pictured with a green lid is NOT what is being shipped. I've used Mennen Speed Stick FRESH Anti-perspirant for many years because of its effectiveness and it's light, clean scent. Recently, I ordered this product, but got Speed Stick POWER FRESH (Silver lid, same UPC label). It is SO different, with a heavy, gaudy scent. I have learned that Colgate is discontinuing the FRESH scent. SO DISAPPOINTED."
1,Disappointing,"This deodorant worked decently on sweat, but it made me smell like a car freshioner. I would not buy it again."
2,"Annoying attempt to replicate the success of ""Hot Hot Hot""..","This is a somewhat annoying attempt to replicate the success of ""Hot Hot Hot"" with a Latin tinged party CD. There are a couple of songs that do stand out...""Mean Spirited Sal"" and ""Nueva Broadway (They Don't Smoke)"" which is about the disneyification of Times Square."
5,Fine Product,I have had this charger for years now. I am happy with it. Durable. It is very convinient for traveling and every day use. Feels solid but light enough where you don't feel like it's a flimsy product.
5,A fine product,"This product is everything you want it to be: inexpensive, functional, and compact. No glitches, no problems. Simply put, I woudln't go with any other device like it."
4,a bit pricey,"Pleased with the very quick delivery from Amazon, but dissapointed that this product is not carried retail locally anymore. Seemed a bit pricey for something that was considered an 'older model' and not in ready supply. Otherwise great product however."
2,it died,"I got this charger with my SD110, and within a few months, it stopped working; it was obviously a battery problem. The battery isn't the best quality either, but when I got a new one, the problem persisted. So obviously it's the charger."
1,Disappointment with J&R Music World,"I did not realize that the Canon digital camera that I ordered through Amazon came with its own battery charger. I attempted to contact J&R Music World to get a return authorization, and after many phone attempts, I gave up. No one would answer their customer service phone. I then attempted to get this authorization via their web site (as they recommended), and I sent them all pertinent details with the return authorization request. They ignored my E-mail and never responded. I will never buy another item from them. I am now stuck with an unneeded battery charger and out the $44.78 charged by them."
1,Just a fad.,"This albun reflect a short fact in P.R. in the mid 90's, it wont be remembered as a clasic. In general lirics are poor, the voice quality is less than average. Good buy if you remember the fad of having a huge pacifier around your neck, fortunately this fad only lasted about two moths."
2,"Great picks, terrible sound quality","The track picks are 5 star. Neotropic and Erwin Van Moll are worth the price of admission alone. However, I was astonished at the poor sound quality of the Quango/Island Records version. I purchased two separate copies (one of them a promotional copy) just to be sure: and after listening to both, I would have to say that this compilation was mastered in monaural sound format. Indeed, I compared the Neotropic ""Neotropic"" track to a version I have from another album, and the two could not be more different. The Journey Into Ambient Groove 4 version has no stereo separation in it at all. For electronica aficionados, this is not a good quality to note in an album.In short, this is a great set of songs that were mastered in deplorable fashion. I cannot recommend it."
4,"A transient, lucid journey.","I am not a huge fan of ambient, but this album, a chance purchase for me is a real delight. Soothing, enthralling, and enchanting...this is a great album for anyone who wants a good break into the world of ambient."
5,This is a truly excellent compilation of music.,"This collection is like tea, at once relaxing and energizing. The tracks differ, but work together as though the artists intended it to be that way. This was a chance purchase for me, and it really paid off. Take my advice -- let it pay off for you too!"
5,The best book I have ever read .,I Have lived though the adventures and have been reluctant to put the book away even at three in the morning.I know nothing about writing but this book has taken me through a wide range of emotions from actual tears to great joy. This for me is Frank yearby's best work. My copy is old and the pages are brown now. Where can I get a new copy - beg borrow or stealI have read this book so many times that my paper back copy is old and brown.
3,A feast for Yerby's many fans,"Yerby sets this entertaining novel in the remote time of early medieval Spain, and blends a colorful tapestry of the clash of cultures: the ruling class of sophisticated and educated Moors, the cruder Christian Goths, themselves only less recent invaders, and the Jewish middle class wary of both.For color and excitement, Yerby is undeniably a skilled talespinner, but his usual weakness of shallow characterization and wooden dialogue (""we women are curious little beasts, Aizun"") is evident here. I was troubled by the continuing thread of misogyny and homophobia that runs throughout all of Yerby's work, but for light entertainment, Yerby certainly delivers. The adventures of the young Goth noble Alaric, who is drawn into the worldly and sensuous Moorish culture as he battles his lifelong attraction to asceticism and mysticism, will keep you turning the pages. This is one of Yerby's better efforts."
5,Great Hat for the price,Saw this hat on Amazon and picked it up since it was on sale. This has turned into my every day Winter hat and is very warm on the head. In fact I wore it to a night Steeler game with 20 degree temperatures in the snow and never had a problem with my head being cold.Buy it with confidence!
4,a steeler's hat for dogs?????,It is a good hat. But since when has the terrible towels gone black and white??? Don't tell me it is meant for dogs...
4,Just like Wine...,"I believe the PSB hold the secret to the perfect pop song, and that's a good thing. After more than 20 years on the scene, they still deliver the goods. ""Flamboyant"", the first track on this 2 track single the boys show all the ""neo"" new wave kids how it's done. Atmospheric keys, pulsing beat and wonderful lyrics dominate the track, it will surely leave you wanting more. ""I didn't get where I am today"", the second track is an obvious outake from their ""Release"" record. The ""feel"" and performance of the track gives it all out. Guitars, drums and rock delivery on vocals show the boys can do it. For any band coming out of the 80's to still be relevant and valued as a mayor force today, they have to be original and exciting. The Pet Shop Boys are still kings."
2,Don't Try This at Home,"This book was less than satisfactory. The author, Charels G. Cullen, does cover many of the topics in a typical Differential Equations course, but the book is completly unorganized. He provides problems at the begining of the first few chapters that one should not be expected to know how to do until the book is finished. Without an instructor and supplemental material, some of the topics are nearly impossible. In the course I took we rarely used it except for homework problems, and the reading we did do needed detailed explanation the next day. Don't read this unless you have to for a course."
4,best hose real ever used,truly a nice tool for the garden. Quality is more commercial grade then consumer.I have installed around 8 of them and only had a problem with one. I hope it will be replaced without a problem under warranty.
5,"Great Product, Super Company, People and Service","Absolutely Excellent Company and people. They contacted me about a backordered part gave an estimate of time and came in well before the estimate, but they checked with me every step of the way, absolutely terrific service from an AMERICAN COMPANY making an AMERICAN PRODUCT. Kudo's to all you folks.I bought 1 each of the hose reels to try them and they are perfect and very well made. I'll be ordering several more of each of them. Good stuff from good people. How refereshing you guys, keep it up!!!!!!!!"
5,Perpendicular Hose Reel,"This Rapid Reel perpendicular reel is my second and I am happy to report there is no deterioration in quality. The cast aluminum mount and reel, the stainless steel fasteners, and the brass rotary joint are what sets this reel from the other plastic models. Of course it costs more, but you know when you go to use it there are no leaky sprays and cracked plastic. Worth the money."
5,excellent product at a reasonable price,"I ended up purchasing 4 Rapid Reel units, 2 parallel, 1 perpendicular and a 2 wheel cart. All of them came with the necessary parts though there was a problem with the thread on one of three bolts and the manufacturer sent me a replacement via FedEx next day 10 AM delivery on Saturday!I am very satisfied with this product and recommend them over any other hose reels that I have seen or used. I give away 4 of the 5 old hose reels that I had and I was glad to see them go."
4,150' not true,"I agree with the majority of the other reviews,with one huge caveat:It will not hold 100' of 3/4"" goodyear hose purchased off of Amazon.(GoodYear HP7262-C 3/4 x 100' Rubber Water Hose ).Sure,its beefy 3/4"",but that's why I wanted a beefy reel.Also note that it wont hold 100',let alone 150'.It isn't that the hose won't actually fit on the reel itself,its that it rubs against the mounting bracket.If only I would have bought the non-perpendicular model,I would be happy!Carefully wound,this reel holds about 90' of my hose."
4,Rapid Reel Hose Reel,"A dandy, just what I have come to expect from Rapid Reel. Made out of actual metal! Good fit and finish, clear instructions, solid product at a reasonable price."
3,Could have been easier to assemble,"Assembly seems straightforward but is complicated by two facts: the assembly manual is one of those books that shows pictures of parts for visual identity but the pictures are too small to actually identify the parts, so there is a bit of guess work trying to figure out which part is used in the first couple of steps in the assembly. Second, the bolts provided for attaching the handle to the reel require superhuman strength to drive into the nuts provided. I substitued similar bolts that could be driven into the nut with a socket.The end result seems to be a heavy-duty hose reel but it is winter and I haven't yet attached it to the house so, for now, I can only comment on the assembly."
5,Fast - Easy - Quick - Fun,"This was very easy to put together.Would buy this again, If I had to. Very well built."
4,perpendicular hose reel,"Bought this to replace a expensive, leaky , plastic POS. This is well-made, does not leak. I concur that it is easier to NOT follow the assembly instuctions, and mark & mount the mounting bracket before attaching all the other stuff. It has nice SS hardware, which I appreciate. Only downside is that When I reel in 100' of hose, unless you are VERY careful to wind the hose very neatly, it binds between the reel & mounting bracket."
5,Great Hose Reel,This is the third hose reel I have bought in two years. Last year's unit didn't last the summer. I then bought one from the `big' home center. That lasted two months before I got rid of it... Then I bought this unit and wow what a great reel. Easy to install and great to use.
5,Buy Quality Buy American,A quality product made right here in America. A definite buy recomendation from this buyer.
3,Not as good as advertised,"The reel arrived with the end of the axle bent. The rotating water supply fitting did not fit on the end of the axle. Being a pragmatist, I attempted to straighten the bent section and broke a small section of it off. However, the fitting then fit and I completed the assembly only to find that the guarenteed not to leak brass fitting was leaking. I found there was an adjusting set screw that seemed to be part of the water tight seal. Tightening it did not stop the leak but removing the screw and replacing it did. So I put the whole thing back together and installed it.The installation on the wall went without event. However, the design is such that you can't just slip the reel off the wall and put it in the basement for the winter. It has to be unscrewed then removed. I would like to see a better design for a reel this expensive."
1,NOT AUTHENTIC,"This is not accurate or complete or un-edited, bits and pieces. Not a good study tool for a student."
2,doesn't do him justice,"i consider myself a belafonte fan, but this compilation just doesn't do it for me.belafonte is known for singing his music differently every time, but somehow i feel that this album is has picked the worst renditions of each of his songs. i chose this cd based on the tracks, but was sorely disappointed by the versions of each. also, the audience drowns him out a good deal of the time.if you want a good live collection, go for ""belafonte at carnegie hall"""
5,My favorite!,"This is the first book I ever read by Amanda Scott. While I have read many since and loved each of them -this remains my favorite. It has such a neat feel to it - Amanda Scott is such a gifted story teller. What I love about Ms. Scott's heroines is that they aren't pouty, as romantic novel heroines can often be. They don't throw tantrums and run off and make the guy chase after them, nor do show their ""strength"" and argue every trifle little detail with their guy (I read one called Golden Lasso or something like that where the girl just wouldn't stop shouting: a must-miss that just made women look bad). Her girls are just strong women who know what they want and go about it in a great way and you really wind up rooting for them. I don't read romance novels that often, but I admit I'm hooked on Amanda Scott's books. As I said, this one is my favorite! (But all of her books are fantastic. Read them - you'll be so happy you did!)"
5,"excelente producto, de alta calidad","los machos warrior punch, un excelente producto de alta calidad, modernos y con un lindo diseño que se adaptan a las exigencias de los deportes de contacto."
4,Study Guide for use with Economics,"I chose this ratin so you people don't be hatin while I be here rhymin bout a book by David Hyman. This book's on econ theory and reads your mind like Siri. A little late to deliver, like deep ball from Philip Rivers. All in all this dude aint stinky- so not like Chris Weinke"
4,Curiously over and under exposed,"One of the most controversial of censorship issues, Curious won a major legal battle the same year that Hollywood Production Code acknowledged a need for adult rating as ""X"". Originally this art film was placed in the same category as ""Debbie Does Dallas"", but don't expect anything of that sort if you purchase it.I am Curious, Yellow is the story of political coming of age of a young woman in Sweden in the late 1960's as a whirlwind of change was entering their system: spiritually, sexually, in the military and in the area of feminism/women entering the work force.It's a really valid era piece, though its artistic merit is going to be up to the individual. It's a mature read, but not quite as mature as the court battle Grove press had to fight for the United States public to read/view it would lead many to believe.Ingmar Bergeman this is definatley NOT, though Curious does deserve to be remembered."
2,strong but thats it,horrible at holding knots. very thick daimeter i order 25 and its thicker than my stren 40lb test. i would never buy this again. all my knots would slip and i would lose my tackle no matter how many knots i put in it.
2,More description would have been better!,"The book took a long time to arrive. When it did it the writing of course was great but the print was a poor quality image that appeared to be a many generations copy of a copy of an old document, printed in 1788. Reading an original printing is great BUT, because the quality was so poor and print style so antiquated, the seller should have noted that fact in the Amazon sales window."
5,Fun never was so beautiful!,"Look no farther. This book is a great introduction to the art and history of tarot. Each section is approximately two pages long - open the book and read. It might be designed for the patience-challenged reader, or the ""quick fix"" audience. Even though you could stash this book in the cabinet for bathroom reading, you'll love it. Each page has wonderful full color photographs that beautifully illustrate the text and expertly enhance the learning experience. If you only have time to read one section, you'll definitely want to come back for more. Rachel Pollack has put together a great resource for the teacher, the beginner, or the advanced tarot enthusiast."
2,Encyclopedia,"Very colourful pages. The content is not deep, like a brief overview of everything. It was like reading an encyclopedia. For early beginners."
5,Multi-America and History,"Rediscovering America: The Making of Multicultural America, 1900-2000 seeks to make up for the usual omissions, the oversights or the deliberate exclusions, in any number of US cultural histories. In an inspired series of entries -- writing to photography, politics to science, film to dance, and with a due emphasis on the contributions to the national narrative of women, migrants, dissidents and artists of every stripe -- it supplies a necessary reference volume. Appropriate recognition is given to each and all of the voices that make up the US's multicultural tradition, whether white-ethnic, African American, Native Asian American or Latino/a, which are set within an informative and unfolding timeline of both US and world events. The entries, drawn from recognized expertise, come over succinctly and to the point, helped not a little by the user-friendly overall layout.A. Robert Lee, The Year's Work in English Studies, Vol. 84,Oxford University Press (2005)"
4,Great Product!,The book I purchased was in great condition and was very inexpensive. I would definetly buy again from this seller.
4,Great read,"Nice study, but very limited for the conclusions she draws.Good read, pretty informative."
5,Man-Child...,"I was a 16-year-old when I heard ""Steppin' in It."" If anyone had told me that this was a fusion/jazz compilation, I would have given them the following response: ""I don't have a clue of what you're talking about, but I do know one thing, this music is from outer space!""I didn't know what to make of the music on this album, but it forced me to stretch my mind to accept what my ears were taking in. As my focus was Dance music at the time, this album, though funky, was ""different."" It took time for me to appreciate what Herbie was laying down.Thirty-two years later, I can look back and say, ""outstanding!"" Five stars for Herbie Hancock and ""Man-Child."""
4,HERBIE GIVES UP THE FUNK,"I love this era of Herbie,he gave up the funk so hard.""Manchild"",""Thrust"",and ""Headhunters"" are allworth owning.Props to bassPlayer Paul Jackson as well.This guy is seriously Mr.Thumpasaurus.Enjoy."
4,Great Follow-up to (2) classics.......................,"I definately recommend- Headhunters & Thrust before you buy this one, but once you have those, Man-Child is just as essential. This is a killer continuation of the funk H.H. & the Headhunters started with the album of the same name. It's like ""Headhunters"" opened the door- ""Thrust"" F*@#'d S*@# up and ""Man-Child"" was a sweet goodbye to some of the best funk music you will ever hear....... Ya dig?"
3,Hancock gets duller,"After excellent Thrust Hancock makes average ""Man-Child"".All the tracks are quite average. The groove you couldhear on ""Fat Albert Rotunda"" is completely missing.This is just kind of instrumental funk without anythingspecially good. Buy ""Fat Albert Rotunda"" instead ifyou want to hear Hancock's band playing groovy &soulful music."
5,Still far ahead of its time!,The spacey instrumentals utilized in this album are mind-blowing. One must keep in mind when listening to this that it is not merely electronic; this is band music void of overdubbing with funk and jazz components that the best electronic artists of today could not duplicate with computers. A true musician in every sense.
5,woodstock backpack,"My daughter is home schooled, but she still needed something to haul her lessons in when we travel, and this is perfect. She really loves it. We looked around online and amazon had the best price. Everyday she watched to see if it arrived,and when it did, she was thrilled. Sometimes she just carries her stuffed animals or dolls in it, but she definitely uses it. We were first looking for Snoopy, but then she liked this one better. thanks again amazon."
1,Border line anti-Mormon litterature!!!,"My sister told me about a book called ""As a Thief in the Night"" Well apparently there are two called by this same title. If you are LDS, you want the one authored by: Roger K. Young! Dont make the same mistake I did. This particular Book is not pro-LDS, and is more about how the LDS church was wrong about the millenium; at least by this author's:Dan Erickson's, opinion. This book is border line anti-mormon litterature.I find his title is particularly misleading, probably trying to ensnare people like me who are more excited about getting the book they want then fact checking particular authors. (A mistake I will never make again.)"
3,Fouth Book in April Grove Series,"""Moonlight and Lovesongs"" by Lilian Harry is the fourth and Final book is the April Grove series and I have to admitt that I am happy that its over with. This book mainly focus on Diane, Carol,and Olive. These were characters that I found the lease interesting. I was more interested in seeing the fate of characters that we had not seen since the first book of the series. Overall, ""Moonlight and Lovesong"" ties up the April Grove series that I was happy to see end."
2,Sounds like I am in a box,"the sound coming my way is fine but everybody tells me I sound like I am in a box. In other words, it sounds horrible for my listeners. should have returned it long ago but I'm too busy to mess with this kind of stuff. Bad phone in my opinion."
3,"It's okay, but not much better than a SoundStation 1","I purchased the SoundStation 2 for its echo cancellation and sound quality improvements. While it is an excellent unit, it was not much better than my SoundStation 1 for my needs. I returned the unit."
1,"Extremely difficult to set up, and woeful instructions","Ordered and received product after first speaking with techhical representative from manufacturer, who assured me it would be compatible with my small office phone system. Then ordered and received unit, which has essentially zero instructions, except for tiny pictures imprinted on various pieces. Multi-line phone system will not allow this unit to function at all. Calls to another technical representative at manufacturer were of no help. Unit is now a slightly odd-looking paperweight."
4,Great Speakerphone with Basic Features,"This is a very basic Speakerphone. It only has call and answer capability, plus a conference button. The sound quality is great. It also works well plugged into the same outlet as a multi-line office phone."
3,People still can't hear me,"Based on other reviews, I'd hoped it would be more sensitive a microphone but I still have to make sure I'm facing it even though I have directly at my side. I debated the expandable but didn't want to drop the extra $100."
4,Peace Lily,"The product itself was decent. It is a small plant, and a few of the leaves were brown spotted. Only one flower was broken. Not at all a bad buy."
2,I will do shopping at the local stores and nurseries,I wasn't impressed neither with the way my plants were packed nor their size and how they looked [Luckily my plants recovered but they still have some holes in the leaves and brown tips]. I went to our local Home Depot and bought at least four-times bigger and healthier plant for much less than I paid here.
1,Please don't buy,"Please don't buy. This is my first review ever @ amazon.com and will be the last one.I never write any review however I woke up in the middle of night and I'm writing this. It's 3:42am now.I ordered this peace lily with rubber tree from Hirt's Garden.They look nice, however they came with mites and other unidentified insects.My house is really clean and I have never had any insects in my home.However from the day I got it (yesterday) I've been bitten by insects.It's more than 100 times, all over my body from shoulder to legs.It's horribly itching, so I woke up in the middle of night and found this mite and the other insect that I've never seen before.I threw the lily and rubber tree out of the window hoping the insects would gone.Again, this is my first time ever in my life that I have this insect and insect bite in my own home.It's so itching. I'm gonna make a claim for this. It's really horrible and I'm still scratching all over my body now."
2,Peace Lily Plant,"The Good: Plant arrived on time, as scheduled and was well packaged and appears healthy.The Bad: The listing for this plant is somewhat misleading because it lets you believe you are getting a fully grown plant in bloom however, what you really get is an itty bitty starter plant that will take about 2 years of growth to get to the size that is pictured in the listing. I ordered this because I wanted a fully grown, blooming plant, not one that I would have to wait for 2 years to get to really enjoy."
1,Shocked at how small it is.,"The plant I received is terribly small, only 4"" high, with 6 leaves, it 's nothing like the picture. I was shocked at seeing it and amazed that the seller would put such a deceiving picture on here."
3,Lily plant,"It came a lot smaller than I thought it would be based on description. Plus, it is supposed to be a low light plant and I can't seem to keep it alive. Trying to do things by the book, not working"
2,Shipped item no where near the photo product description,The plant that arrived was a full 1/3 to 1/4 the size of the plant used in the photo used to market this plant. The photo was the factor used in deciding to purchase from this vendor versus others. I will not likely purchase from this vendor again.
2,Peace Lily,"The freight charge to obtain the peace lily was low so it took some time to receive. The plant arrived in reasonable condition. It is quite small. Sort of like the seedlings one obtains at a garden center. It did not have a flower as per the picture. Again, I suppose this is a factor of the low price. If you want a more mature plant you will have to expect to pay more."
5,Hirts Peace lily Plant,"After reading some of all the reviews on this plant from Hirts I had to give voice, I Owen three plants I ordered from Hirt's House and one is the Peace Lily and all I can say is the all my plants are doing very good it just takes the right care and to know what your doing. I wish I could put a picture of all the plants I orders so every one can see, but if you could you can on my Garden page on Facebook.com and look for slickrick20032001@ yahoo.com and you will see them all and I'm in Brooklyn, NY any way I just want give Hirts House a excellent job on shipping and packing the plants they arrive in excellent shape. From RRAMOS thank you for your service."
3,It's hanging on for dear life,"This plant arrived in good shape. I read the directions and have tried it in several locations around my house. I can't say it's thrived, but it hasn't died yet either. I dunno if this is my fault or the plant's fault so I'm giving it three stars."
1,Shitty Manufacturing Standards,"When purchase, product comes in a nice plastic container sealed.When open (brand new) close inspection will reveal a different story.1) You will find occasional scratches on the disc.2) You will find occasional paint marks on the disc.3) You will find occasional oil marks (if you're lucky, you'll find finger prints) on the disc.Lastly, the plastic material used in the manufacturing process to laminate the metalic foil has high electro-static attraction characteristics towards dust. I have conducted experiments on similar product with different manufacturers/company under same enviromental condition and found this to be true.I might also add that if you intend to use this as a reliable form of backup for your data/video and plan to store it for more than 2 years, you should avoid using it because the viscoelastic characteristic of the plastic decays rapidly compared to other manufacturers."
1,What you see is NOT what you get,"I specifically ordered these DVD's because the picture showed them to be an 8X speed. When I recieved them, they were 16X. What you see IS NOT what you get in this case...One positive note, return was easy and credit was issued with no problem."
2,"Great songs, good vocals, terrible arrangement","Given the great songs and the vocal talents, this CD set is a major disappointment. Simple laments are overwhelmed by big orchestral flourishes and merry percussive beats. Complete betrayal of of the sentiments of most of the songs. Only if there is a way to strip away all the accompaniment..."
5,BUY IT FOR THE ORGASMIC COW EFFECTS!!,"I must admit, when I first heard Roast Fish and Cornbread, I nearly fainted. Who's makin' out with the cow in the background? Anyway, if this box set price is too steep for you, look for REGGAE GREATS -- LEE SCRATCH PERRY on Island label. This controversal dreadhead is the #1 producer of some serious head-bobbin', body-swayin', toe-tappin' trax. You probably don't wanna listen to this box set sober, you just wouldn't get the full effect of Scratch's improvisations and verbiage, especially if you're not knowledgeable about serious reggae."
4,the best Lee Perry bang for the buck available,"Lee Perry -sometimes really satisfying roots reggae, sometimes dense and dubby, sometimes god-awful stoned excursions into nowheresville. This collects his best stuff from the classic Mango label and separates a lot of wheat from the chaff. 'Could have used a few more cuts off the ""police and thieves"" album by Junior Murvin, could have done with a few less of the endless dub recycling of the various versions of various songs, but all in all, the best Lee Perry Box Set available and markedly better done than than the Trojan Imports. Nice booklet comes with it too -all you'd ever want to know about the guy."
4,Great!,"Awesome! A world of advice, due to the many different versions of songs, I have found it is much better to play the cd in ""random"" order- four versions of a song don't grate on your nerves when spread out. Any dub or reggae fan must get this!"
5,All Hail Black Ark,"Essential Scratch! Loaned it to a friend who had never listened to the Upsetter before. He brought it back and coined it the ""best box set ever"". Get it..."
4,Language of argument,I received this book in a timely manner. I was shocked at how small it was but found it to be very helpful.
2,The book is outdated.,"I didn't like this book. The book is outdated. With this class, it really does matters which essays are included."
3,decent book,"decent book, needed it for college. bought it used to save money, but the book was really beat up.buy at own risk"
4,Cute,"I really like this mobile, but maybe it could be a little cheaper, for how simple it is... (no remote.etc)"
1,Eh...,"Not a quality hat. I thought the team was funny, and it would be a cool hat to have, but it just looked bad."
3,Poor packaging,"Good translation, but there is no title on the spine of this book, it's just blank. It's dark blue and thin, so it's already damn near impossible to find on a shelf. Really big pain."
3,Interesting but not captivating,"It's an interesting story about a teenage girl who doesn't fit in, who doesn't play by the ""mean girl"" rules, and who is scared and curious about her sexuality. Lacie is coping with the suicide of her father, her best friend's changing priorities, and her first boyfriend. It's a bit melodramatic and trite, but overall a well conceived novel that will appeal to young girls."
1,A piece of stinky poo,"The reason why the sound quality is so crappy, is because this is NOT an original recording. The person who made this taped it off a VCR tape off their TV. The tape was of an old bootleg show. Usually, Metallica doesn't car about bootlegs - in fact, they have a special section at their concerts where fans can make recordings. BUT, Metallica are upset about this recording, and have looked to ban it. It is illegal, and it sounds like crap. DO NOT GET THIS!!! It is NOT worth a dollar!!"
3,Sound quality........,"Sure the sound quality is a parking lot full of squid vomit, but it's metallica's first show. This is essential to any true fan. however, Only get it after you've experienced the awesomeness of Metallica's first 4 studio albums. Once you've got those, then definetely consider this. The sound quality is horrible (all you people complaining about St. anger being underproduced, this is not for you.) But if you want to see metallica's roots definetely pick this... up. Be forwarned however, this will put a dent in your wallet. but if you have the cash, and have their studio albums BUY IT! Metallica rules!"
3,hmm,"yea...this is junk, not worth buying, an hey retard metallica didnt copy ""the mechanix"" , and anyways who cares, megadeth has some good songs, but trust me, they are NOT better than metallica."
1,FORGERY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Most people were tricked thinking this was metallica's first show-NO WAY! METALLICA SUED THE STUDIO THAT PUT THIS OUT! It's a fake! Actually it's the No life 'til leather demo tape with crowd noise from cliff 'em all thrown in!! That's why it;s out of print!! COme on people, every metallica should know this a fake!"
2,No Life til Bootleged,"Yes this is just a bootleg copy of Metallica's No Life Til Leather Demo with a lame attempt to sound live. Fact is they never recorded any of shows in the era this claims to be. As far as who ripped who off? You're all a bunch of idiots. Nobody ripped anybody off. The Mechanix is the early version of the Four Horseman. This version was written by Dave Mustaine who at the time was Metallica's lead guitarist. In a vain attempt to sound original and not use Dave's material, they changed the lyrics and added a few changes, after they axed him. He formed Megadeth to spite Metallica. Ring the bell kiddies, class dismissed."
3,Live?,"First of all, let me say that I love Metallica. Let me get that straight before I condemn this terrible dubbed ""live"" set. What we have here is actually the famed 'No Life 'Till Leather' demo, made to sound live using stock crowd noise, and some of Hetfield's concert remarks from the 'Cliff 'Em All' collection. The songs are so poorly dubbed that this is not even an acceptable way to attain the Leather demos.However, I did give the disc 3 stars. This is because I feel like any legal and authentic bootleg cd by the Horsemen of the Apokalypse is worth the money. And I feel like this odd cd will eventually be re-salable for more than its original asking price.Die-hard fans should get this one, but others will probably feel ripped-off."
5,this cd is great,This cd is one of the best metallica live cds. I never knew that their was a bass player before cliff. the mechanix song sounds pretty cool.
2,To Top Heavy,"we had to send these back as well along with the tri candlestick holders by Nambe, after placing candlesticks in these and placing them on the table we did not feel safe leaving them up espically with the cats in the house, we have a glass table and with these heavy guys falling over it would probably break the glass. i was excpecting more twists to be in the metal as well, GO SPIRIT by NAMBE if your looking for something with alittle more LOOK to it."
4,Post-colonial studies: the key concepts by Ashcroft et al.,This second edition of Post-colonial Studies was updated in 2007 and is essential for anyone interested in Post-colonial or subaltern studies. The authors are synonymous with this field of study and have written extensively on this subject.Post-colonial Studies' encylopedic format makes the contents easily accessible. Each entry is comprehensive but concise and includes a list of recent literature for further reading.Recommended for tertiary students.
3,eh...,"I doubt this book would have many sales if it wasn't required for college classes. That's why I bought it and found it less than interesting. Actually as I read it I found myself just thinking that it sounds argumentative just to be argumentative. It doesn't really provide any great insight and is really just an introduction book.So if you're looking for an introduction to post colonial studies this is a great start, but if you're looking for something beyond the surface I'd look elsewhere."
3,Interesting and novel perspective,"Though film synopses are not especially artistic or exciting, Fr Blake's thesis of how Catholic concepts of community, sacrament, and symbol influenced six major directors is well presented. The underlying ideas were quite thought provoking, even if their relation to some film sequences bordered on the contrived. Impeccable scholarship in a readable work - and a good present for an intellectual film buff."
1,Sounds like a scam,"Funny...I must say this was a bad investment and that I really didn't get what I paid for. Something about the way that the lead vocals comes across that I just wasn't sure about.I found the band's organization okay, but I would wait until they have things sorted out before investing in this offering."
1,CEO Attempt to be Country Western Star,"Band was formed by the former CEO of Healthsouth and now convicted felon,Richard Scrushy. Scrushy could neither sing the high notes,nor play the piano so ringers were brought in on the company's payroll. Most live versions were lip synched. This CD/Cassette was so bad,Healthsouth employees were told to call local radio companies asking for the Dallas County Line songs to be played. The music is bad enough,but he siphoned Healthsouth funds to indulge his dream of being a country star."
3,The Best Band Money Could Buy,"Former CEO, Richard Scrushy spared no expense in making this record. I picked up a copy after reading the album cred's. Among the players are steel guitar extraordinare, Paul Franklin (Mark Knopfler, Dire Straits) and LEGENDARY bassist, Willie Weeks (Eric Clapton, Gregg Allman - his list of artists is endless). I remember seeing a music video that featured appearances by several celebrities including the late (GREAT) Chet Atkins and football/baseball superstar, Bo Jackson.I must point out that I haven't actually played this CD yet."
2,Some chances are just bad.,"I do understand artists expanding their styles.. but this to me was too much of a departure from his other work. Intensive Care is a great album that I listen to alot, but this one is lacking in the sytle that I love so much from his work.."
1,The End?,Got this CD over a year ago and still can't get over the painful listeningof the once great Robbie Williams. Whatever happened? This looked like a rush effort to compete with the UK Top 40 newbies. Intensive Care is still a better effort than this. He badly need better material for the next release or we would lose him forever.
3,Note To Robbie: Stop Rapping!,"The album would be so much better if he stuck more to singing. Rudebox comes across as more of a poor mans Rock DJ. The only time you'll hear it in the U.S will probably be in a gay bar. Keep On and Never Touch That Switch are probably the only hip hop tracks that could make on the airwaves in the states.Viva Life on Mars, She's Madonna and Lovelight show Robbie in his familliar of cheeky lyrics and catchy melodies."
2,Robbie does Madonna and Eminem?,"Yuck. On first listen, this album sounds like Robbie trying to do Madonna and then Eminem. The vocals are monotonous, the beats the same. It's dance music, and not my cup of tea. I'll give it another listen, but I'm guessing there will be maybe 2 songs I'd want to keep on this cd.Paul"
4,Rudebox,"Rudebox being Williams 7th studio album and 2006 release was a major hit in Europe and Argentina and Australia. The album peaked at #1 in Switzerland, United Kingdom, Argentina and Australia to mention a few. The album spawned the singles ""Rudebox"", ""She's Madonna"", ""Lovelight"" and ""Kiss me"". I especially like the track ""She's Madonna"" and remember hearing this track being played before hockey games. The booklet contains all the lyrics and a list of whom plays what on each track. 4/5."
1,I love Robbie but this disk was horrible!,"Ugh! This is not what I expected from Robbie. I, like a lot of others, am disappointed that he has not caught on in the US. Well, I can tell you that this is not the CD I would use to try to hook anyone on Robbie. It was so strange. Maybe it was kinda techno? I'm not sure, but I sure know that it was bad. My husband paid quite a bit for it at Christmas. I listened to it once (I'm not sure I made it all the way through)and then turned around and sold it at a local used CD shop for a couple bucks. Well, you live and learn, I guess."
5,In a word - Compelling!,"I feel the compulsion to keep reading long after I should be sleeping. Last night, I went to bed around 11PM with this book in hand, only to be up reading it until after 1:30AM. I'm normally a slow and methodical reader, but every once in a while a book comes along that urges to me read faster and faster. The World is just that kind of novel. The writing causes me to hasten my pace to get to the next part.I like the ""refrains"" that are used throughout the novel to drive the theme along. ""There's nothing worse than a sneak."" I also enjoy that it is not written in a linear or chronological fashion, but in snippets to reinforce each theme. I think my favorite lines are when arbitrary thoughts pop into the Artist's mind and he self consciously thinks how funny they are."
2,Tool Set,"The good news is you get a box that holds tools, and tool sizes are fairly standardized. The bad news is the tools themselves aren't very sturdy. I had already broken some bits for the screwdriver on the second or third use."
5,"Excellent example of ""down home"" coastal cuisine","Enjoyable book to read and an excellent guide to Gulf Coast cooking. A delightful blend of both family history and family food traditions. If you can't find anything good to cook in this book, you don't belong in the kitchen."
2,Falls Church is right on -- skip this book,"I completely agree with Falls Church's comments about this book.Noonan harps on the need for simplicity, yet fails to drive home her points. She is constantly meandering, even though her chapters are short. There are good tips, but no lessons. It's no wonder there isn't any table of contents.Although her anecdotes can be encouraging for those speaking in public, overall this is a dissappointing experience."
2,You can have an idea about this book just by noticing it has no table of contents,"You can have an idea about this book just by noticing it has no table of contents - the book has no logical organization, and it's not pleasant reading it. It says nothing but the basic and the obvious."
1,Good Grief!,"I love reading Peggy Noonan's WSJ column; so let's get that out of the way right now. Peggy generally writes in a stream-of-consciousness form that I like. It captures my attention from the first sentence and holds me to the end. But not this book. After a page or two I noticed I was skipping ahead, looking for the bait and the hook. It's not there. That's Writing 101. She knows that! What I suspect is this: Her publisher contracted with her for a give-back linked to something else, and she wasnt interested in the project. It shows!"
4,Good primer and guide for public speaking,I have read several books on this topic and have enjoyed this one particularly. You can feel the days or Reagan in the writing and that is a good thing when it comes to public speaking. It is not a political book at all - just speaking.
1,I actually tried to rely on this book for a presentation...,"I couldn't beleive how bad this book is. Not really a presentation on how to speak well, but full of recollections of her career-long speaking days. There was nothing useful in this book, except if you want to hear her reflections on talking her grades up with the professors in college back in the '60's. A complete waste of time and money."
2,Politics Disguised as Speech Advice,"If you want simple, well organized and effective guidance on making good speeches, get 7 Steps to Fearless Speaking, by Lilyan Wilder, don't get Simply Speaking by Peggy Noonan. Ms. Noonan is okay with words, but she uses every single platform available, including this book, to push her right-wing politics and bash others, especially Democrats. It is unfortunate that she can't seem to open her mouth or her word processor without giving us this same old tired theme. Apparently you can't give a good speech unless you subscribe to her politics.The book is also not particularly well written and is poorly organized -- her editor should have done better on this end. The only reason I can come up with for reading/listening to this, when I thought about it, was that it has lots of anecdotes about political figures and speechwriters. So if you're looking for something to really help you give speeches, this is mediocre at best."
4,A good reference source,"If you're a speech writer or a person who is often called upon to speak in public, you'll find this slim volume full of nice advice. I liked best the sections that featured passages from some of the memorable speeches Ms. Noonan has written for others. Maybe it's time for a collection of her writings from Time, the Wall Street Journal, as well as complete texts of her classic speeches? Publishers & editors should look into this."
5,Best First Book For Public Speaking,"This is one of the best books to read when you have decided to become good at public speaking. She says have something to say and say it the way you need to say it. Then work at making it interesting to see for the audience. If you don't have something interesting then you are giving the wrong speech. The great achievement is become the speaker you want to be. Help the audience to understand that you are speaking the truth. Author's real life stories are excellent. She was speech writer to Presidents Reagan and Bush. Despite all the good things that Toastmaster's International does, it does not advise its new members give the speech you what to give. Don't copy anybody develop you."
1,Where's the beef? Or ... where's the cologne?,"I ordered these as holiday gifts for a couple extended family members in early December. Although out of town for a while, I was encouraged by the order & shipping confirmations from Amazon.Imagine my surprise, when I arrived home, to find a basically empty package with a note ... ""We regret that we are unable to fulfill your order ... in the meantime, we are enclosing a sample of one of the newest products we have received in stock.""Thanks so much - left me hanging & had to get other gifts at the last minute."
1,Thief!,Seller sends out a sample and coupon. Called and says instead of sending a refund they sent a $5 coupon. HUH??? They thought it was alright to do this to customers. This is stealing!
1,Not a reliable company,"Purchased couple of bottles Grey Flannel on 12/2/07. Rec'd shipping confirmation. When pkg arrives - it turns out to be a padded envelope w/an apology stating they are oos. Contacted CR same day to request refund - as of today, monies have yet to be creditted. Not a company I would do business with again."
1,disgusting of all,"I got Grey Flannel from Amazon after reading all the reviews. The first time, I used it I got really turned off. Not planning to use it any more.Will not recommend to anyone."
1,oldie not a goodie,"gray flannel is an old cologne that simply doesn't hold up whatsoeverinvest in something quality, cleaner and fresher"
1,HOOORRRIIIBBBLLLEEE!!!!!!!!,Ok I bought this cologne and sprayed it and couldn't wash it off fast enough! it smells like cat piss! do yourself a favor and don't pay attention to all of these old people that praise this. Although if you wanted to wear this hunting instead of spritzing yourself with deer piss I'm sure this would work as well.
2,Tried To Like This One,"I've read about Grey Flannel and it was a popular fragrance in the 80's. I'm into the 80's colognes and I have never smelled Grey Flannel. It was available for a cheap price so I thought, I've heard so much about it and how so many people used it how could I go wrong for $14? Well let me tell you folks, this is a hard cologne to love. It starts out smelling like some kind of turpentine or medicine its really rough. It does eventually settle down to a calmer smell, but still strong enough to repel others. I can't bring myself to wear this one again, but I'll keep it for nostalgia sake. Pheew!"
5,This is a GREAT,"Eau De Toilette for a MINIMAL price. I often get compliments from people who will say ""What's that scent"". This is not fancy cologne but very very nice nevertheless.)"
5,A user for 20+ years,I found grey flannel when I was a much younger man. The mixture of fragrances suits me well and I've received many complements through the years. Why mess with success?
3,Disappointing,"I was a little disappointed by this purchase. The details said the comic was new but when I recieved it the conditions were less than acceptable. All of the pages and cover were wrinkled as if someone had sat on it multiple times. The most irritating part is that I bought this as a gift, but due to it's condition I was too embarrassed to give them the gift and had to spend more money on something new.. However, the comic itself was good."
5,A History Lover's Delight!,"This is one of the best books by Ms Grafton. The images are colorful, sharp, and clear. Ms Grafton provides authentic advertisements from the turn-of-the-century, as well as furniture, cars, luggage, and cigar ads. Many of the graphics are old photographs. This decoupage book is simply beautiful and very useful, also containing the old stand-bys such as holidays,butterflies and flowers. Highly recommended!"
4,"Sex, Love, and Murder As Advertised in the Sub-Title","James Ruddick, in Death at the Priory (Sex, Love, and Murder in Victorian England) has served a slight, but tasty, treat. This short volume will fulfill all the expectations promised by the sub-title, which is more than enough. This is historical journalism (complete with the author's own prescence throughout the story) rather a work of history as it skims the surface of the Victorian world. It is,,though, the stuff of old fashioned English murder mysteries with its mysterious poisoning, clandestine affairs, competent and brooding lady companions, and, especially, its English country house (although set on the edge of London). The author covers all of this rich territory effectively and adds to this story with all of his fascinating new research. For lovers of murder mysteries or even simply a good tale, this will be sure to please."
3,Ordinary writing and mediocre detecting,"Ruddick's writing is workman like, journalistic but never very exciting. His ""solution"" to the crime is based upon the slimmest evidence as he accepts and rejects information as it best suits his goals. The interviews of the families and the ""clues"" obtained, 130 years after the events are a bit ridiculous. The book is very short and might have been better had it been written by someone who knows how to write true crime."
5,Victorian life as you don't want it!,"A great murder mystery, very well written set in the Victorian era. I've often yearned for those kinder, quaint times during the late 1800s, early 1900s. Maybe, after reading this book, I'm no longer so eager. Social conventions could strangle the life out of a girl, force her into flawed marriages and more. Florence was brought up as a spoiled, rich girl. Nevertheless, when her first marriage failed, her father turned his back on her. To save her name and her social position, she married a man who was cunning and conniving personified. You won't be disappointed by the true life twists and turns this story offers."
4,What things were really like then,"More than just a true-crime mystery, this book presents an affecting view of Victorian England and women's role in it. Ruddick's conclusions seem credible, and his research thorough. Next time you leaf through a flower-and-lace bedecked glorification of Victoriana, remember that women's real status at the time was far less pretty than we'd like to remember."
4,Nice reading,"It ended before that last pages of the book cause there is some reference stuff back there. It was an interesting book. But I found problems. In the inside-cover, there is a illustration of the floor plan. But that floor plan does not match the outside of the house!?! Which is wrong? I would also like to see more real pictures in it."
4,Did the job!,They fit and hopefully they'll hold. Nice not to have to throw away this old pot that's been in my family for a very long time.
5,Just got these and work great,"I was a little skeptical, but for $5 decided to give it a go.Worked great. Solid handles. Not sure what peopel were talking about to have the handles break.Would purchase again."
2,Did not fit as promised. The item broke during installation.,Did not fit as promised. Item broke during installation. Would not purchase again. One size does not fit all units.
1,"Does not ""Fitz-All""!","Bought these for a medium sized Farberware pot. Unfortunately, they did not fit. Wish I could find out where I could find a suitable pair of replacement handles..."
4,"Mount for stem, not for second bike","This product is just what it says: a product to mount the VDO on the stem rather than the handlebars. It is NOT a complete kit to mount the VDO on a second bike: it does not include a spoke magnet.I mistakenly assumed that the kit was for a second bike and was dismayed at the absence of a magnet (this was entirely my fault and doesn't reflect on the quality of the product, but this review is just a warning in case anyone else may make the same assumption). Fortunately I had a spoke magnet from a Cateye that works well. Otherwise, the mount itself is fine."
5,orchestra sytle background music,My daughter(12 years old) likes this music a lot. She is Korean and does not understand the lylics but she says the music is fantastic.Hope to see their concert in Korea.
2,Irish troubles,"This is an informative book about the long conflict in Ireland between Catholics and Protestants. It is unbelievable how religious differences can cause so much bloodshed and turmoil. It's a dry read, but gives a lot of information."
3,Writers' Guide to Texas Markets,"This is an excellent reference book for anyone who wants to get into the market of writing books or articles for magazines. This book is a bit outdated, but does offer a good starting place for a person who is new to the field. Upon reading this book you will find information pertaining to how to go about freelance writing, how to submit a query letter, a writer's view of the Texas market and a magazine editor's point of view on publishing written material. This book has extensive lists of both book and magazine publishers in Texas. This information includes items like addresses, contact person, when the company was founded, and more."
4,big cot,"this cot is very strudy and well made. the ends are very hard to get on so if your taking it up and down every day then I wouldn't buy it.however its made very well.I've had cots before and they usually broke. I really doubt this one would.its actually a nice looking cot also,it came on time and packed well. I think i would recomend this highly if you don't have to take it up and down every morning."
5,Slumberjack Big Cot,"I bought this cot for my son. He loves it. The cot is nice and wide so your shoulders don't hitt the bar. The cot is very sturdy, and made very well. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a cot."
4,Way better then the ground...,I normly use an air mattress and end up on the ground by morning - this is way better once your half way through the night. The first time putting it together was some work trying to stretch the fabric out to get the second end piece in... but it got in there and worked great.
4,Very Good Cot,"As a heavy guy, I wanted to get a cot that would fit into my tent, support my weight comfortably, and help keep my non-waterproof gear off the floor. This cot fills the bill very well. I found it quite comfortable using just a sleeping bag as a pad. The under-cot storage is roomy enough to hold a week's worth of clothes and towels. The only downside is that it takes some strength to stretch the top to slip the end-rails onto the pins at the top & bottom."
5,Excellent Cot...don't forget a pad!,"This cot is very sturdy and worked great! My only complaint, is that the first time I used it I did not bring a sleeping pad. It was very cold (Under 25 degrees) and all the cool air came up from the bottom of the cot. My second trip I used a pad and in the same temps found it worked great! I weigh about 230 and found the cot was very sturdy and supported me with ease."
3,Cute!!!,"""Ride It"" is a very fun, europop piece. It's not as catchy as Kylie's ""Spinning Around"" (which is Kylie's greatest song, in my opinion), but it gets you moving and singing along. Geri does a passable job with the disco classic ""it's Raining Men"", but it's no threat to the original."
4,Funky Funky Funky!,"Geri Halliwell, has never and probably will never be able to succeed as a professional artist in a true sense. However, this song shows her strengths: a flashback to the person she really is...A SPICE GIRL! This song is jam packed with funky tunes, catchy simple lyrics and a hilarious video! Well done GINGER!"
5,One Of The Best Yet,"5/5 >> A dance track from the producer of Kylie's ""Can't Get You Out Of My Head"", it appears that for her comeback single, Geri has taken the safe option. However, this song will not disappoint. Catchy and fun, you will be riding this song long after it first rings in your ears. And check out the video, which sees Miss Halliwell camping it up as only she knows how."
5,W-O-W!!!!,"Love it!!!. I don't remember the last time I played a song so much, I've been listening to it for ages, on an every-day basis. It's catchy and upbeat, makes you wanna dance and sing along. The remixes are fantastic. Anybody with good taste in music will surrender to this amazing song. Enjoy!"
4,The Revival of Disco,Geri Halliwell's first single off of her third album Passion was very disco-esque. The song brought to mind the great disco hits of the 1970s and had a very nostalgic feeling to it. That being said it was a great dance track that would been an even bigger hit in say the 1970s than the 2000s. Another thing is that this song would have fit in better on Schizophonic than Passion. But over all though its still a great track.
3,School Book,I had to get this for one of my college classes... i hardly used it which i hate when teachers make you get the book and don't hardly use it!!
3,Mother wanting a Nannies Help!,"I have owned the Supernanny book for a while now, she does know what she is talking about and it has been helpful to me as a mother of two lively kids, unfortunately, it is very limited and mainly deals with behavioral issues - is not as well-rounded as i would like it to be.I do recommend Nanny Wisdom as a more well-rounded parenting book."
5,Supernanny to the Rescue,"This book was a God-send. After seeing Jo's loving, yet firm approach to childrearing on the TV show, I bought the book. Our challenge was removing our 4-year old son from our bed. I used Jo's method (including the sleep separation technique) and could not have predicted how smoothly this would go. Wow - we are on day 8 and he is sleeping in his OWN bed without a fight. His bedtime routine is taking between 5 - 20 minutes. We now have a happy, well-rested child, not to mention happy, well-rested parents. Thanks, Jo!"
5,We love the Super Nanny!!!!!,We were having a little trouble with our 2 y/o... And I was very stressed. MY parents got this for me. With in 7 days my daughter was sleeping in her own bed everynight without screaming. We are also going to work on the other things she has listed but we need to wait till the new baby comes in 8 weeks.This is a great book. You learn you need to be consistant and you and your partner must be on the same page. Or the child will find the weaker one and use that member to their advantage.This is true once in a while my daughter will try this with my husband. But he has learned from this and now is getting the upper hand.
3,Not too deep,"I love the Supernanny TV show and I thought I could gain some good reference material from buying the book. I found the book pretty basic and learned nothing I didn't get from watching her on the show. I was interested in seeing what a real ""schedule' looks like, how much time to allocate for child/housework activities but found nothing on this. I still love the show but sorry I bought the book."
4,great book!!,im a single mom and i have four children and her star chart that she has you make really does work.. id tell everyone who is thinking of buying it just to buy it. you wont be disappointed.
4,Great help and ideas/solutions for new moms and stressed nannyies!,"Dont let the little ankle biters win! Get some help! Get this book and find new solutions to old problems along with anecdotal humor and support! As a part time, long time Nanny, I loved it!"
3,Still need help..,I thought the book was way too vague. There's a lot of large print which tells me that they were just trying to fill up pages with nonsense. It should have gotten into more specifics. It didn't really offer the results that I was looking for. If you have a child with ADHD these approaches don't work. Ohwell. I tried.
3,good-in-desperate-times,"This book is easy to read and to the point, no nonsense, you will love it...I recommend it to all parents and granparent.....anyone who has to deal with children."
3,Random Grammar Errors,"In terms of how to better communicate and understand children, the book was quite informative . However, the downside was layout and minor grammatical errors. I didn't like ""My Top Ten Rules"", they seemed to repeat themselves throughout the book, and white on black wasn't the best colour for those pages. Once every 10 pages or so, there'd be a sentence fragment or so. Overall, the price for this book is more than reasonable, and reveals many precious details kids have."
2,"Eh, luke warm on this one",This is really much of the show re-hashed. I was excited by how pretty the book was and the typesetting and the photos but there is just no meat to this. I was hoping for more.
5,The best suppernanny ever!,"I think every parent should read this book but also should see her tv show, or get the dvd's coppies of each season. This woman truly understands what does every child needs and wants from their parents, and also provides you with the tools and techniques required to be successful in doing so. This book summarizes the key points reached during the show, so i highly recommend it along with the dvds to parents who really want to take over their parenthood, and have healthy and happy homes!"
3,Not what I expected,"The book is nice, although I did not feel as though it taught me anything that I couldn't learn by watching the show. I thought it would be more in depth and I am a little disappointed."
2,Fell short of my expectations,"I think Jo Frost and her marketing team must be applauded for Supernanny. It is what it is - a book that is meant for mass market & broad appeal. Unfortunately, this means that the book will only be ""a little bit helpful"" for many and ""a lot helpful"" to few if any. It simply scratches the surface while avoiding the more challenging and sometimes complex topics parents face. I agree with some of the other reviewers who state that Supernanny seems to lack the depth that will be helpful in raising a child well. This is certainly a fun read, but do not go into it with very high expectations. I would certainly supplement Supernanny with one of the more well respected and detailed parenting resources ..."
5,Great parenting reference !,Quick and easy to read. You can easily flip to a relevant section and put it away again for the next parentig dilemna. I am buying another copy for a friend.
3,I'm not too sure....,about the book but I must say that it was very refreshing to see the show on Jan. 24th. I've had problems getting my daughter to sleep from the time she was 18 months and it was nice to see that I'm not alone!!
1,Hack,"She Shouldnt be allowed near Children, let alone giving advice about raising them. She clearly has no idea what she's talking about. I'm suprised she didnt use examples of Violence in her claims of controlling kids. Keep her away from your Children!"
2,Old News!,"My mom bought this book for me b/c my (almost) three-year-old boy is an incredibly difficult child to discipline. He seems to listen to others much better than myself or my husband. So I thought I'd see if the Nanny had any better ideas for discipline than I was already trying. The book was full of everything that I had already tried (more than once!) and it just wasn't working. I would not recommend this book , unless it includes the nanny coming to live with us!"
1,Jo Frost out of Touch,Jo Frost is out of touch with parents and the problems they face. She'd prefer to blame games and other intangibles rather than get at the root of troubled children's problems.She makes claims she says is backed by research but never cites it. Don't buy her book.
4,Not As Good As Nanny 911 But Still Useful,"This book falls a little short in the content department but has great, beautiful pictures. In fact, it is an inspiring book in that respect.The television success of this show and Nanny 911 has proven the value of the direct and loving approach to parenting. Consistency is the key!Behavior Coaching by Dr. Scott Hall and Matt Pasquinilli and Nanny 911 would be two books that I suggest you buy together with Supernanny."
1,Title doesn't give you the right info,"When I purchased this book, I wanted to use it to help me with my 6 year old son. Figuring that the title says ""Getting the Best from Your Children"" it would have covered a wider range of ages. This book is more for parents who have children under 5."
4,helpful tips,"some stuff is basic common sense, but does have some 'techniques' to try in various situations that have seemed to help w/ my 2 1/2 year old."
3,"Good stories, rather irritating style","Before I begin, let me make myself clear: this is a review of this book, not of the stories. I like these Norse myths. They are worthy to be counted among classical mythology. This book, though, is just now what I expected. I was expecting the real thing. Instead, I got a retelling of the stories with a rather irritating, juvenile style. Don't get this! Buy The Prose Edda, The Saga of the Völsungs, or even Tolkien's retelling, The Legend of Sigurd and Gúdrun. This book is a disappointment."
5,5 stars,"It's free, I can't complain. I've always loved mythology so I give it top marksGo Nordic people's! Is this 20 charecters yet?"
1,Not authentic enough for my 9-year-old,"My son is a fan of Norse mythology. He was terribly disappointed by this book right off the bat because of its not very well-hidden Christian agenda. If you're looking for a good retelling of these stories, don't make the same mistake we did."
5,AMAZING,This is perfect for classic Norse mythology. Perfect for any reader. This book contains all of the well known Northern legends.
4,Great first read,I read this because I didn't know about Norse mythology. I found it very interesting and very informative. I like how is divided in short stories and how everything comes together at the end. I might read it again
1,waste of time,"I thought this book was terrible. The writing was simplistic and juvenile. The story was predictable, and the ending was silly and unbelievable. At first it was interesting to read about the relationship between Sookie and Hyun Jin as children, but when they both became lured into the Korean prostitute ring the story became incredibly boring. I was very disappointed and I don't think I will read any more of this author's works."
4,Scary and Touching,"This book It you into the front line of poverty and desperation. You ache for the main character as she falls into prostitution, but you also rejoice in her love for the child she takes into her heart. While the begining of the book is good, and the middle is very strong, the ending is sadly weak and anticlimatic. The book definitly leaves a bad taste in your mouth about prostitution, and leaves you wondering about whatever did happen to the children of American GIs in Korea....."
5,Havaianas,"These are THE best. They last forever and don't flatten or wear down. I highly recommend these. I have quite a few pairs and some are years old. They come in every color under the sun and you can get regular or the more narrow fit. Love, love, love."
2,Men's Sandals by Havaianas,"May be OK, but looks ordinary and cheap. RE-ordered and received the Urban style, which is better looking and appears more sturdy."
4,Comfortable & Soft,I am not usually one to buy products for a 'name' but these were recommended to me by a friend and I'm glad I bought them. They are very comfortable and feel great on because both the straps and the sole are so soft. I've also discovered they clean very easily in the washing machine!
5,comfy,"Very Comfortable flip flops. Have bought a number of pairs. I would highly recommend these flip flops. I do have to buy one size down, but that may be due to short toes."
3,Dirty flip flop,"I love Havianas (the product gets 5 stars) and received these in a timely manner. Unfortunately, the left flop has dirt or something all on it. So my nice white flip flop looks grungy before I even wore it :( Not happy b.c I spent $25 on flip flops, I at least want new-looking, clean ones!!!"
4,Mostly as expected,"Havaianas are good quality, comfortable flip flops. I have pairs that I've had for years now and of the various brands of flip flops that I've bought, they are definitely my favourite. This pair, however, is slightly different. I'm not sure if I've just never bought this model before, but I don't remember there being a raised rubber section in the middle of the flip flop (where the label is). It makes the sole of my foot feel slightly odd, sort of as if there was dirt of grains of sand under my feet. This isn't a major concern, however, and doesn't really bother me very much. Still a good product."
5,Simple and strong,"These flip flops are truly amazing. I picked up my first pair in Thailand for three bucks thinking they were just cheap sandals. These things stood up to three months of hiking and motor biking in three different asain countries and barely looked worn. I've done hiking in these that I wouldn't even do in sneakers. They are comfortable and durable as hell. The only downside is when they get wet, they are slippery as hell, as in your foot will just slip right off of them, but they will still grip the ground. If you don't get em wet, these will be your best friends. Oh yeah, break in time was about two days for me."
3,Nice but sizing is annoying,"I have already a few pairs of havianas and I love them, so I thought I would order a pair for hubby. They are nice, but the size is too big:( He usually wears a 11.5 so I orderd the 12/13 thinking that this would be better than the 10/11 but I was wrong... So I like the quality but I hate when there isn't real sizes for things..."
3,$18 flip flops,"Just got them but it seems paying for the name, don't see any difference from the $3.50 Old Navy flip flops. Either trade down to Old Navy or go up for the Adidas slides at about $26.Definitely sized small. I normally wear 11 or 11.5 but the 12/13 fit perfectly. The 10/11 size would've been way too small."
4,Very pleased with application,i used on rear brake shoe replacement. It goes on easily without fuss or mess. Hopefully it performs as expected.
5,Great product!,"I use Anti-sieze on nearly anything that is made of metal. If anything has the ability to rust or corrode then always use this. I have taken so many rusty bolts out that have broken, or dragged the hole way out, but now anytime I assemble something metal I use this for the fasteners to prevent breakage and easy disassembly. Reasonable price for a product that will save you money, time, and frustration."
5,A must.,I use this stuff on anything I care to get apart again. This stuff sticks to everything it gets on so you can rest easy knowing that when you need to get whatever it is apart again you wont have problems.
3,"Incredible product, poor package execution.","First of all, the product just plan ""works"" as advertized. Stops bolts from; getting rusty, stripping aluminum heads, or any bolt from just plan seizing... the whole shebang.Lets get to what doesn't work. The packaging. This is coming from a view of a person that works on a cars as a part time hobby DIY'er.1) The screw on lid: Not very greasy hands friendly.2) Brush on the bottom of a screw on lid: Bristles end up looking like a toothbrush that has been scrubbing grout for 20 years, after a few uses (going in every direction)I feel if the manufacturer made a squeeze tube with a cut off tip, this would have solved all the packaging/user problems.In closing: Product is Phenomenal, Packaging not."
4,"Great formula, bad bottle packaging","This stuff works GREAT but it gets everywhere! You only need a light coating on each screw, but this bottle comes with a big brush attached to the underside of the lid. You always have to wipe a ton of it off on the rim of the bottle, but it ends up glopping everywhere. Definitely keep some paper towels around when using it!"
2,Not for the beginner -incomplete and misleading,This book is certainly not a complete guide. If you buy just one book on oriental rugs this should not be the one. It is overly simplistic in some area and overly detailed in others.It is neither a good book on new rugs nor of antique rugs as it is quite outdated. Still if you have a collection of rug books already and know the subject well some nuggets of information can be gleaned from this book.
4,"Enjoyable read, although occasionally dry","Enjoyable read, occasionally the pace slows and the material seems to lack spark - but this is only rarely an issue."
1,Boring!,"What a painfully boring book! I was really looking forward to reading this book, as I normally love biographies and had heard some interesting things about Gellhorn. Unfortunately, this turned out to be soooo boring! What a waste of my money. I kept waiting for it to get better, but it never did."
2,Martha Gellhorn's life isn't worth reading.,"why did anyone choose to do her biography? only real accomplishment of her life was marrying EH. Sooooo, self obsessed, war-loving, name dropping, floosie.I've read a lot about this era and these folks--I've never heard of Martha Gellhorn and after reading this tedious, fawning, hero-worshipping (god, it's worse than watching Larry King), now I know why. This was not a women of substance. She was a dillitante and a hanger-on with good legs."
4,Fills in the Gaps,"I have been reading Gellhorn's non-fiction and am generally dispondent that I have found myself at the end of what is readily available. I picked up a copy of Travels with Myself and Another at random and became fascinated by Gellhorn. On the strength of another reviewers recommendation, I selected this book rather than others. I was not disappointed. It is a strange thing to read someone through their own eyes and then to see them without their own filter. Her own professional writing portrays her as a strong woman at ease on her own, while excerpts of her private letters suggest that she was very lonely. In any event, I zipped through the book and was surprised at the manner in which her life ended. Although, on reflection, I shouldn't have been."
5,Beautiful cross!,This was a cross I had wanted to buy for awhile. The original price was too much for me. I was thrilled when I found it at the price that I did. I was also impressed by the prompt delivery.
2,Not Strong Enough,I purchased the wedge-it for my classroom door. It lasted about 4 days! When my students enter and leave the room some bump into the door and the door closed slightly each time. Eventually the wedge cracked and was useless! Very disappointed.
3,Tacky,I did not realize the book contained photos and pictures from the 50's - the prose is reminiscent of 'Housewife syndrome' of that time.My mistake - I should have been more selective in choosing a gift intended for daughters rather than women of a much older generation.
5,Fun birthday organizer!,"My friend bought me this cute birthday book. For those of us who can't remember a date to save ourselves, this is a godsend! I like the size of it and the pictures and quotes are too funny! You won't go wrong with this purchase. Anne Taintor is hilarious!"
4,"fun, convenient size, only wish more space per date","Is good for basic use... Pros: I liked how it gave the facts on the monthly flower, stone and zodiac signs, the fact it had a hard-bound spine, the size is convenient, not too small. However Cons: Would liked to of had a little more room per date - It lists 8 dates/page, and with my writing, I can fit maybe 3 names/dates per date area. But is fun, and I got a great price so can't complain!"
5,Adorable!,"Love the item. Perfect place to keep all important bday dates! And, it's cute enough to leave out for others to also look through. The retro-vintage pictures inside are absolutely great and there are a lot of them."
5,As described!,Got this for my brother for his birthday as he is a big Jaws fan. Very informative and we searched some of the places out when we went to the Vineyard for a vacation together with the entire family...
5,Jaws Logbook,"I bought this out of curiosity, as a fan of JAWS for many years I decided I wanted to find out about the 'behind the scenes' part of this classic movie.The Log book is filled with humour, great pics and interesting facts about the making of a shark film in the 70's that would become one of the highest grossing films of all time.Wonderfully written by screenwriter Carl Gottlieb, a great companion to the DVD."
5,Atula- Unequalled,"This book sets the standard for authentic Jyotisha instruction. Like a rich, lush jungle, it rewards the intrepid explorer with treasures and medicine for the ills of ignorance. Dense, and at times seemingly impenetrable, it is nonetheless a matchless source of wisdom for those who have disciplined their minds and prepared themselves to enter the dazzling universe of Jyotisha.Be careful though, once inside, you may never want to leave.Goes well withDecoding Your Life Map With Vedic AstrologyandDecoding Your Life Map With Vedic Astrology Part II"
5,Excellent Book,"This is a excellent read. Personally having Indian roots but having studied western Astrology, I found that this book helped fill so many gaps in my knowledge, which I simple accepted as facts earlier.If you want to dive into why ? and how ? this book is the best one you can choose. The language is fluid, at times its hard, but makes a very good read. Would recommend it to anyone with a bit of western knowledge who wants to learn the Indian system as well.RgdsAnand Chawra"
4,From darkness to partial light - with help from this book,"I bought this book in India having pored over several good, but hard to read Indian books on Jyotish ( Vedic Astrology). Defouw and Svoboda have put much effort into making this book read well for the serious enquirer into this ancient art.It certainly helped me gain a greater understanding of the subject while sitting on a South Indian beach, and even after my return home I find it useful and informative.Highly recommended if you want to learn the subject properly."
5,"11,000 Years Lost, But Never Alone","I just finished reading this book. The story takes place in modern and ice age times. Esther, who is from the modern finds an clovis point and from shortly after that point she is pulled back in time to the ice age. When she arrives, she must learn to survive and survive she does thanks to her clovis family that takes her in and teaches her. She will learn to hunt all types of animal and pick the right plants, make clothes, and tools. She will do this all, yet she will come to love her family that has taken her in to become part of them.I found this to be a great read. I would recommend it to anyone of any age. Have a great read!!"
2,Nice product but not reliable,"Last February I bought a PoGo AudioRave because I found very convenient the idea of having an MP3 player and a USB Flash Memory in such a small package.For two months I was very happy with it because the sound quality was very good, the unit was light and easy to operate and the process of downloading music was very simple (..just drag and drop the files from any computer since the unit shows itself as an external USB storage..).All my happiness is over. Two weeks ago the volume control stopped working and I ended up with an MP3 Player where I can not hear anything since the volume level was very low when the problem happened.The bottom line is that today I only have a fancy USB Flash Memory that works quite well. That's half the product I originally bought and that's the reason I give it 2 stars."
4,Price increase,"I have been watching this item, considering buying it. What happen, it was $199 on 3/15, and on 3/16 it now sells for $239. Is it made of oil? Very high price increase, just found it on another site referring it back to Amazon at $199, but when you go back to the site guess what, it is $239."
5,great all-around tuba mouthpiece,"I bought this mouthpiece months ago and am very happy with it! The Faxx 18 is an exact copy of the Bach 18, but costs about $20 less. Excellent tuba mouthpiece for all types of playing - I regularly use mine for brass quintet, tuba quartet and concert band."
3,for the Care Bears enthusiast,"My little girl stumbled on Care Bears and fell in love with them -- the old ones. I tried to watch the newer version with her, but Dark Heart was too scary. This is one of the older (original) versions. We bought this together with Sharing in the Sunshine and Magical Moments. This is her least favorite one. I don't think we've watched it more than twice in the last year."
2,"The Price is Wrong, Bob","In truth, this wouldn't be a bad disc, if it weren't for the phenomenal collection Evolution/Revolution -- the only non-Warner Bros disc essential to your collection. Why? Because it has all (or most) of this stuff, the entire Craps disc, and a ton of other stuff approved by Pryor (unlike this and several other Laff Records rehashings of the same tracks with different titles). I think if you get Pryor's self-titled debut with WB and Evolution/Revolution, you'll have the perfect combo for the early Pryor. Look at the money people want to charge you for the CD too, what a joke."
1,Not too Happy...,"I am quite disappointed with this spreader. The spreader portion is detachable and loosens up a lot resulting in badly done crepes. One time I was spreading and it fell off. I tried to tighten it, but would not tighten. Since the spreader is thin, I did not want to use a mallet to make it stay for fear that it will break, besides it will come off again. I am just glad the crepe maker I bought had its own spreader, which I have now been using instead. I wanted to return this; however, I do not want to pay for shipping. This spreader costs $15.00 and would cost $9.00 to ship (amount I paid for shipping when I purchased) so it had cost me $24 already; so probably not worth returning. Maybe if I glue the spreader to the handle, then I can use it someday? Oh well...buyers beware."
1,Crepe Spreader review,This crepe spreader is too expensive for $15. You can buy one for $3.50 in any cook store.
4,Huge knowledge,"I found this book good for the quotes and easy explanation of certain topics.Admittedly, I haven't read it cover to cover, it's hard reading, but very handy for cross-referencing."
4,Personal responsibility - personal action,"Anyone who having recently read John Allison's book ""The Financial Crisis and the Free Market Cure"" should read von Mises' book. The foundational thinking behind Allison's book is represented in large measure from von Mises' writings and the Austrian economic school of thinking. The book challenges traditional thinking about government-led economic intervention in times of crises. Sound economic practice is based on principles and not on political whims of the moment. Great emphasis is given to the notion of personal achievement or the freedom that allows individuals to take primary control of how they want to live."
4,For Free Marketeers who can't get enough,"Not an easy book to start with - better to read after other greats who are perhaps more understandable, like Murray Rothbard, Milton Friedman, Ayn Rand, Henry Hazlett, Walter Williams. Ludwig von Mises is on a level of difficulty with Hayek for me, but if you can't get enough Libertarian propaganda, this is one you'll want in your collection."
5,genius,"This book explains the nature of economics, its place amongst the various sciences and the amazing consequences of economic laws.While this is not an introductory book, it does not have any mathematics nor does it delve into minutiae. A motivated novice could tackle this book after reading ""I, Pencil"", ""Economics in One Lesson"" and some choice editorials.However, the book is massive and brimming with information, so it will be easier for someone who is familiar with core economic concepts. This is essential reading for anyone who wants a complete understanding of economics. The broad and penetrating perspective that it gives is phenomenal."
3,Much better than the first book,"This one had an original plotline that didn't seem to need to base itself on any of the Earth's children series. The only downside was that the characters weren't quite as developed as they were in the first book, and in parts it seems as though Spinka has second thoughts about where she wants to take the storyline; sometimes things you think are going to happen don't, but it's not done in the ""plot twist"" way, it's more like ""let's try this instead"". Sloppy writing, but still an enjoyable read."
3,Vacuum filter pack for Eureka 430,"When I bought this item I thought it was like the picture but instead it came black with a cone shape and I was expecting that it won't fit in my vacuum but surprisingly it did, even though it was no the same shape as the original it works and it fits perfectly at the base of the cylinder at the top of the cover.I'm not sure if it filters up to 99% dust or very small debris but I'm happy with the results as my vacuum does not sound like it is working heavy.If there is no more this item in this re-seller store then I will buy from this seller again."
1,Didn't fit!,"It is in the trash, doesn't fit my machine. Rather a disappointment. I bought one locally instead that did fit."
5,Vacuum Dust Cup,"Initially was sent the wrong item, but company was very helpful in getting the matter taken care of."
4,fILTER FOR VACUUM,"tHIS IS A NECESSARY ITEM FOR MY VACUUM, SO IT IS NOT A QUESTION OF WHETHER I LIKE IT OR NOT."
3,filters,This filter is not as easy to remove for cleaning and emptying vacumn as the one that is made by Eureka. It makes it harder and messier to empty the canister. I will probably not purchase these filters again.
1,Bad filter for a bad vacuum cleaner,"Amazon did a fine job in providing this product, but the product itself is a really bad one. Do not buy any vacuum that requires this filter ), Eureka's specifically."
3,Filter,"I love this vacuum, but the filters clog up very fast. I basically have to change them twice a month. Thank god they aren't too expensive!"
5,Eureka 430 Series Vacuum Filter,"The Electrolux vacuum filter package for the 430 Series Eureka upright vacuum contained four filters and is a great bargain compared to the individually sold filters in retail stores. The filters are just as effective as the ""name brand"" and I recommend their purchase and use by anyone with the 430 Series Eureka vacuum."
1,THIS IS NOT THE FILTER YOU WANT,"There are many sellers who sell compatible filters listed for eureka model 430. This is my third filter in two years, including the original. This one is the less durable kind. It's more cone-shaped. I was hoping to get a cylindrical, better quality filter. It costs about the same as this one. That one is manufactured or packaged by EnviroCare Technologies, model or number 946. That was my second filter and i did not know what i was getting until i received it, just like when i ordered this one. That better quality filter lasts much longer. I wash mine after every 2-3 uses. This filter, just like the original, does not last long."
4,just what I needed,"This is just what I wanted, glad I could order it for a good price with the number right in front of me instead of making a special trip to the store to find they didnt have it."
3,Lots of attention,"I agree with the other person's comment that the filter cloggs fast but look at its size, of course it will clog fast. You will need to give the filter some TLC but you don't need to throw it away and especially twice a month. Get some canned air or a Bicycle pump with a needle valve to concentrate the air or better use a compressor to blow the dust and debris right out of it."
4,DCF10 is better than DCF14,"Filter Type Dcf-10I have two Optima vacumns, one for downstair and garage, one for upstair. I have two dogs. I replaced the original filter (dcf10) with the newDcf 14. I like the Dcf 10 so much better. It is durable after many wash and much easier to install. Dcf 14 is made of some kind of fabric the catches the dirt and it is very delicate."
3,Good for small spaces,This is a great vacuum for small (carpeted) apartments. It is powerful and compact. I empty the filter after each use (I have a cat) and rinse it with warm water every third use. I replace the filter entirely every six months. I'd rather dump the contents of the vacuum after each use than let it sit in a traditional vacuum bag in my home.
2,nice but ...,"This is a very nice book, full of great images. I have to say however that something really bothers me : ""cow"" tells children that bulls have horns, and cows don't. And that is absolutly false ! I tell you, my cow Daisy is really mad at the author and illustrator !"
3,it's ok,"i think that this book was good and my kids love it, but from what i've seen there's better out there. don't be fooled by all the pretty pictures. the informational content leaves a little something to be desired...."
2,zipper problems from the start,"There is no need to bash this tent because it is very simple to set up. I like the compartments and the looks, but I found the zipper to enter was getting stuck from the initial set up. It's one of those things you don't expect, but when you are out camping and the rain and wind are in effect, that zipper getting caught allowed for rain and wind to get in. It also is for two people rather than four. Do yourself a favor and buy a bigger size tent than what you initially shop for. It is much more worth it."
3,Brazilian fun,"Reginaldo Rossi, the self-proclaimed king of Brazilian Brega music, offers this ""Golden Selection"" of 20 songs from his career that began in 1964. Many of my personal favorites are here, including ""Sai de Mim"" and his greatest success, ""Garom."" However, absent from this compilation is my all-time favorite Rossi tune, ""Em Plena Lua de Mel.""Be forewarned: this CD may not appeal to the masses. Perhaps a more apt title for Rossi would be ""King of bar music."" The music quality is often close to terrible, and some Brazilians can't stand his tunes. That said, however, these songs are a lot of fun to listen to. ""Garom"" reminds me of an ultra-cheesy version of ""September Morn"" by Neil Diamond. If you can understand Portuguese lyrics, you may want to give this CD a try. Some of his lyrics and rhythms are so terrible, they begin to grow on you. This is a definite guilty pleasure."
2,Falls Short,"As stated by another reviewer, this album is edited in a way that the listener always feels like he has entered the joke halfway through, and only hears part of a punch line. The individual tracks on this album are very short, unlike one of Pryor's most popular tracks, ""Mudbone"", and they dont flow well either."
1,I love Richard Pryor but...,"...this album is horrible. It's a collection of poorly mastered sound bytes from numerous different shows. It doesn't flow and half of the time you can't tell what is going on. The material is ok, but it is definitely not the cutting edge stuff that Richard Pryor is famous for. Please avoid this item."
5,the Great Story-Teller,Richard Pryor tells Stories from the stage like so very few.he has a way of saying things that Leave a Lasting Impression.this Disc highlights His Genius.any subject&he has a tone that captures the Enviroment Right on Time.You Feel his Depth here.
5,Great Trilogy,"Since the romance writers discovered the Vampire, it is difficult to get a real rock 'em sock 'em blood drenched vampire book with lots of action and steamy sex. Look No FurtherNight Blood is the first in a trilogy of ""Blood"" Books. The other two, Dark Blood & Immortal Blood MUST be read in sequenceand tell the story of the presence of vampires among us.The Story moves geographically from Houston to New Orleans and ends in Banff, Canada.The only weakness in the books is the author's attempt to ""update"" those attempting to read the books out of sequence or as a stand alone. The plot has lots of twists and turns.The eventual ending is predictable, but the series are a very enjoyable read.There could even be a FOURTH Blood Book."
3,A bit stuffy,"Some of the terminology required a dictionary on hand. It was interesting and informative, shutting down the theory that serial killers are a modern invention."
1,sluggish,"This book was written in a form which was not conducive to easy reading. Not sure where the author was going with his opening chapters, but I can give a suggestion where he could put them."
2,Not so Remarkable,"The life of the author, Englishman Harry Brodribb Irving, (1870-1919) is much more interesting than the one, and only, book he wrote. The first 8% of this book is devoted to superfluous verbiage about nothing as the Brits are want to do. Harry, the author, had gone to law school and then decided to be a stage actor, but was never able to come close to his father in that craft. Father remained the best known and loved English actor of the time. Eventually Harry put his law degree to work in researching and writing about noted criminals of the 18th and 19th century. Comparing his writing to John Grisham, one can't help but wonder if Irving's years of theater didn't taint even the criminals biographies. Definitely not a page turner."
5,fascinating,"it's in the public domain and i downloaded it after reading a brief blurb. Irving became fascinated with crime after hearing his father talk of sitting up late discussing murders: ""rob history and fiction of crime, how tame and colorless..."" an introduction to 19th century criminals of all sorts."
5,Fantasic,This is a great product. I hate slimy or stick and this is neither. It does not leave you feeling dirty after the act. Allows for easy insertion but not like you just stuck it into a can of WD40
3,Haven't finished it.,"Haven't finished, but what I have read is interesting. What is great is that it was written before the DeFoes, Mansons, Dahmers ect."
3,Maybe,"The criminals described in this little tome may have been remarkable in their time, but perhaps not as remarkable as some of the psychopaths of the past 50 years, such as the zodiac killer, the Green River Killer, the Boston strangler, Jeffery Dahmer, etc."
5,A great book for all dancers,this book is a necessity for all serious and recreational dancers! It helped me reach a new level in my dancing by giving me guidelines in how to maintain a healthy weight and how to acheive an optimum state of health required in both the professional and pre-profession dance worlds. Even those who are not dancers but want to achieve a healthy body and sustain a healthy lifestyle will benifit greatly from this book. It not only outlines dietary necessities but also stresses the importance of excerise and keeping a well balanced lifestyle.
4,Great for non-dancers as well!,"This book helped be understand WHAT kind of exercise I needed to do in order to lose body FAT. I'm not in the ""overweight"" category, so books that tell you to ""just take a walk"" or ""take the stairs instead of the elevator"" aren't the most useful (I already do those things).I'm not a dancer but I would recommend this book to anyone who would like to go down ONE size, and doesn't need to go down 3 or 4."
5,i'm in love,"Finally a book for dancers. all ballerinas KNOW we have a different set of standards to adhere to, and FINALLY, theres a book that pops up and helps us instead of attacking. I think the skinnyhaters need to calm down and understand dancers live on a whoole different PLANET. To Chmelar and Fitt - i adore you, thank you, thank you, thank you."
3,Not what I expected,"This book was way too complicated to understand. It was like a science book, I was looking for something a little more easy to follow. I ended up giving it away."
3,Diet,Gives some good info and I felt it really helped me understand about dieting and the dancers body. Full of great information.
3,Mmmh!,"It is a little confuse for young adults, specially if they are not familiar with measurement :-("
3,A Character Study,I bought this DVD in part on the strenght of the reviews. This film has an inteesting cast and they prove they can act. Not a masterpeice but not a dud either
3,not so home alone,well...i am a maculay culkin fan so i bought this not knowing anything about it. it was a good film. i was so proud of maculay at the end of the film. totally worth a watch. maculay saves this movie
3,A bit too long to start,"Very good film of author, a bit too long to start and we would like some more.The distribution is excellent, and we take time to know the characters... Too much for my taste.We would like to have some more: to know what it occurs in their head after their experiment. Will there be repeats?I've been announced this film as being a comedy, but it is more one drama of manners.The reactions are realistic (though some other reviews say) and I would have preferred that this vision is looked further into. To see this film in couple can certainly bring a certain discussion.The play of the actors is right and the realization is without too many artifices. The soundtrack is amazing.Admittedly a good entertainment but we remain on our appetite.In my humble opinion, it takes too much time to try to know the protagonists; we would like to really know what occurs AFTER...Still, it is a good movie it's worth seeing..."
3,Unrewarding,"Tiresome dialog that passes for spontaneity does not a full-length movie make. Somehow, a dire experience that reminds me of 'John and Mary' (Dustin Hoffman and Mia Farrow, was it?). Give me 'Bob and Carol and Ted and Alice' any day, instead, despite the dated scenario. Even an episode of 'Sex and the City' merits more involvement on our part."
5,"Swisher Zero turn 36"" mower ZT1436","...The ZT1436 is ...It is a bit noisier than other brands I have tried, but for the money I saved it's bearable.It does the same job around trees and plantings as the more expensive units and for me should last a lifetime as I do not intend to use it daily to mow for a living.(Professional brands)I would recommend this to anyone with ""stuff"" to mow around as it cuts your lawn care time in half(even less) so you can move on to other interests.Just as easy to use as the Big names zero turn units, only half the price.So far I am quite pleased.Parts are available internet and phone, but no local dealers for service.I figure I can fix anything that may go wrong and they will supply the parts if need be.This Zero turn mower actually makes lawn work fun!"
4,Great Unit ForThe Money,"The Power Tower is sturdy, and works well. It takes up more floor space than it looks like it does in the picture, and there is sometimes a little wobble to it. The handles are very comfortable. Assembly was fairly easy.It would be nice if the chinup bar went totally across, or if there was a part that was not angled.All in all, it has been a good addition to the home gym."
4,very good product.,"Use these almost everyday. I have very oily skin, and it's very hot where I live; these beat having to carry around a bottle of facial wash.These little sachets stand up to being knocked around in your handbag, too."
1,This battery is junk,"This battery is junk, it doesn't accept more than 40% of charge whatever you do and you will have to pay to ship it back for replacement."
1,Outrageous Total Ripoff !,I paid for a battery for use with my two C840 laptops. The thing they sent me did not charge beyond 23% and caused my Laptops to display a white warning screen saying the battery was dangerously defective and that the laptop would shutdown automatically immediately. None of the other batteries (from Amazon and DELL) have any of these problems with either laptop. I was forced to pay to return the defective battery.And now I have paid over $62 and have nothing but an email run-around.Disgusting and outrageous!
1,Dont buy it.,"I assumed I would get a battery that would charge and discharge just like my old Dell one. At first this battery seemed pretty normal but it would discharge a little faster than it should have. 3 weeks later, its only charging to 80%, and seems to be going slowly downhill."
1,NOT WHAT I ORDERED,This battery DOES NOT work for DELL Latitude C640 !!! It needs a battery that is 14.8V with a 3800mAh !!! The battery sent to me only has 2200mAh !!!They advertised this item asTechnical Details14.8v 4800mAhFALSE FALSE FALSE!!!
3,A Sincere Cry of the Heart,"This book is so authentically heart-felt that, even if the reader has not had the adoption experience personally, reading this author's thoughts and feelings on one of the most important and frightening things that ever happened to her, is valuable and deeply affective. Of course each mother's reactions and responses to having a child are different but this author clearly delineates the universal and central beauty of motherhood: love. In her most interesting story of birth, surrender and reunion love shines. For 38 years the ember of a mother's love for her first child lies in this author's heart and its power gets the people written of through a difficult, thorough-going life change."
2,Not recommended,"I was disappointed in this book primarily because it was Sally McNamara's tribute to herself as a birthmother. I felt that her reasons for writing the book as well as the way in which her book was written screams out ""narcissism"". In addition it was poorly written and poorly edited. I found myself sympathizing with her relinquished son who was not being heard. At their first meeting she went on ad nauseam about her education, how bright she was and her school activities while her son awaited the story of his birth and some validation."
2,"wasn't, able to use this product",This seat wasn't tall enough. I wasn't able to use it at all. Too bad I couldn't send it back.
3,Missing Pieces,I bought two White Mountain puzzles last Xmas for my mother in law. While she enjoyed the challenge of putting them together one puzzle had 2 pieces of a different puzzle in the box and was missing the two pieces necessary to complete the picture.
5,More helpful than any other source,"I have spent hours on the phone with Dell, Microsoft, SBC, HP and countless other ISPs and manufacturers and have not been able to resolve issues or restore my system to usable status. This book tells you all that you need to know to put your system back in order, without transferring you around, routing your questions to India or blaming software or other system components for your problem. If you are tired of wasting your time using ""tech support"" this is the book you should have."
4,excellent insights about the new ages in front of us,"The author presented a very well developed imagination about what types of world and society is coming to us and what tasks we should prepare for. The seven traits of LWB(learning as a way of being) were excellently contrasted with the present paradigms of education which we must overcome. I wish the author or else could go further into the possible and more concrete pictcures of educational system in comparison with the present public and state educational system, represented by the schools."
5,I've stopped using my stove!,"It's is a great skillet. I bought it for the size. It is big enough to act as a griddle -- I can make bacon in it and pancakes to feed several people. The temp control is responsive, the glass cover convenient, and clean up is easy.Strongly recommend this brand and this bigger size."
5,presto electric skillet with glass cover,The skillet works very well. The non-stick surface is holding up well. The clean up is easy and it holds an even temp. Would buy again.
5,Presto Skillet,This is one of the best electric skillets I have used. Tryed other brands and the non stick surface always sticks... This one has large pan and heats evenly across the entire surface. Would purchase again if needed.
3,Fry Pan Review,"The frying pan is roomy, heats well, the only drawback is that you cannot put the lid on partially or vent it."
5,"16"" elec skillet","Very nice style, works great. The heat seems even throughout the bottom of the pan, no hot spots like others I've had. Easy to clean. Very nice product."
4,Nice Electric Skillet,"I like this skillet, it gets the job done. It cooks evenly and has accurate heat settings. Also, the clear top is a plus. My complaint is that it feels cheap. It just seems really light weight and there is a lot of plastic pieces. I feel like it is just going to crack or melt.....But it has not yet! So far so good!"
5,Great Skillet,This is a great skillet. I've had a couple of square skillets made by a different company but the size of this one makes it much easier to cook. The quality of the non-stick finish is better than the previous skillets I've owned and I like being able to see the food I'm cooking without taking of the lid. Great quality at a great price.
4,Presto electric skillet,This unit is larger than most electric skillets. & Amazon has the cheapest price going.We use it often because it's quick & easy to use.http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007XRTDG/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_title
5,great product,Pros: 1) adjustable temperature 2) easy clean up 3) roomy enough for both bacon and eggs 4) great for gravies and sauces 4) serves as additional cookware when all the burners on your stove are being used 5) portable. No cons on my part. Great buy from Amazon.
1,Non-stick means coating comes off!,Functions well except that coating flakes off too soon. Expect more durability and quality for an item that comes in contact with what is eaten.............
4,super electric skillet,"even though there are just two of us I love this large skillet....I can cook pancakes for both of us at the same time. same with french toast...can cook bacon,sausage and eggs all at the same time....love it! It is great for poaching chicken breasts to make a big batch of chicken salad. It can be awarkward to clean in a small sink, but that is a small price to pay for this great skillet."
5,Great,I bought this electric skillet and have used it once so far and I really like it. The only down fall that I see with the electric skillet is the glass top does not have a vent on top to let the steam out. You have to keep taking the lid off to see the food.
2,Don't waste your money!,"This skillet was okay until it stopped heating up! I have only had this for a few months then one day when I went to make pancakes, it just wouldn't heat properly. I thought maybe it was my outlets, so I change where it was plugged-in, nope, it just stopped heating! What a shame too because I really needed and wanted a larger electric skillet, but I guess you get what you pay for. This is a true piece of junk and I would not recommend to anyone! Oh Presto what happened to your quality products?! Unfortunately for me, this turned out to be a big piece of junk!"
2,Nasty black film after dishwasher,"I replaced an old square skillet with this, and this one is about twice as big. A bit too big for cooking for 2. Also, it is too big to fit in my sink, to wash it. Since I can't wash it in the sink, when I put it in the dishwasher, it comes out with a nasty black film on the underneath metal part of the pan, and the film rubs off on EVERYTHING. So after the dishwasher cleans the inside, I have to scrub the bottom with a brush to get the black off. I would not buy again, just for that reason alone."
4,the nonstick is a bit too easily chipped,"I really enjoy the skillet for a many variety of things. I cooke eggs, bacon, at the same time. Pancakes, potatoes. This skillet is really a great product. I would say the only downfall is the non stick surface is starting to chip. It just seems you have to be SUPER DUPER Careful because one touch of a fork can ruin your skillet."
4,Versatile pan,"We love this skillet and use it for many things including frying and boiling. The ONLY drawback I have found is that, after using and general handling such as cleaning and storing in cabinet, the one handle starts to loosen and I need to get out the screwdriver and tighten the screws on the bottom... an inconvenience but does not detract from usage."
5,Great!,Used it to cook and I really really loved it. Was simple and easy to use but cooked and held everything I needed!
5,Glad I bought this unit,"I needed a new electric skillet since the coating on the old one had come off due to wear and tear. I liked the idea of a glass top to see how the food would be cooking while at the same time preventing grease and splattering from the food go on the counter. I have used this unit twice and I like it a lot. The heat was even throughout the skillet. It said that it could be cleaned in the dishwasher but I don't think I want to subject the coating to an hours worth of pounding water and dish soap. That's just me talking. I cleaned it both times by hand with a dish cloth and soap and it became clean easily. I haven't had any heavy grease or stains,crust,etc. on it yet but I I imagine that would come of also pretty easily. The directions said not to use a brillo pad or real abrasive pad to clean it since it could harm the coating. I like the unit. I also like pancakes which cooked well!!"
5,Love it!,"We love this skillet because it is so easy to clean it. The see- through lid is a plus. No need to remove lid to check food. This is our second one The first one was lent to son & family. They did not want to part with it. So, we gifted it to them & found this deal hard to beat. More expensive in retail stores."
2,Be careful,"I love this skillet with one exception. The feet of this skillet are very slick. There is no traction. In turning the Salisbury steak the other night it took off on me and the next thing I knew it was dangling off the counter by the cord and dinner was on the floor. All it would have taken would be manufacturer flattening the foot portion of the leg a little or applying some sort of no slip/rubber foot. I will be sitting the skillet on my silpat for all future use as, in my opinion, this presents a serious safety hazard."
5,great skillet,"It's really hard to go wrong with this wonderful electric skillet. Ease of use and cleanup has to be the most alluring factors when considering buying a skillet, and this product does very well on both of these levels."
5,skillet that truly cooks without sticking,"I used such skillet five times since a purchase. A meat or a fish did not stick to the bottom, neither protective layer has been peeling off. The screws that attach ""legs"" may get loose but this is not my concern."
5,Great for the RV,"This is just the right size for the RV and for home. The RV having limited cooking space, and the propane oven is not easy to cook with. This can be used for everything and cleanup is a breeze."
5,Fabulous Product!!!!!!!,"This is the best electric skillet I have owned to date. It is extra large, nice for a big family. I use this about 3 times a week. Cooks great, cleans easily, great value for the price."
3,Presto 06852 Skillet,"I bought the skillet to replace one that would not control the heat and the teflon was coming off. I have used this skillet about 6 times and I was disapointed on the non-stick coating, it is very rough. It is slow to heat, and is a problem to wash, it is so big, the cradle is way to big for their purpose. But what could I expect from a China product, Amazon should put the country where their items are made. I try not to buy China products."
2,Burns the pancakes,Try making pancakes first. This skillet left burner marks on the bottom of the pancakes...making them cook unevenly. I will try another brand.
1,Not Non-Stick,"This skillet lost it's non-stick finish after 2 uses. Not only that, but it was cumbersome to store. I threw it away after 3-4 uses."
2,Cheaply made.,"The legs are terrible. They aren't stable even when you first screw them on, and then the screws constantly loosen so it wobbles. This is a safety hazard. The lid doesn't have a steam vent, which is annoying. The pan also has hot spots.It's a nice large size. Nice for cooking, but cumbersome for storing. I made the mistake of storing it on top of my refrigerator, and one day it wasn't pushed back far enough and the whole thing came tumbling down when I opened the freezer. The glass lid broke into 7 billion pieces, some of which I am still finding.My last cheap electric skillet, a Black and Decker Deep Dutch, was much better. I got a few years out of that one, with the legs staying sturdy the whole time(the heating element eventually broke)."
4,2nd one,This is my second purchase of this item since I wore the 1st one out. I love the large size. I researched intensely to find the best rated electric skillet and this is the one that all sights rated the best...especially for the money. It doesn't cook completely even but all electric skillets probably have hot spots. My only gripe is the base becomes loose frequently and I have to tighten the screws. The same thing also happened with my first one. I thought the maufacturer would have corrected this flaw on the newer models and was quite disappointed when I saw they didn't. I love how easy it is to clean up. Completely immersible. Very good buy for the money.
5,Presto Electric Skillet,Presto 06852 16-Inch Electric Skillet with Glass CoverBought this to cook breakfast a couple of times a month for about twenty people. Cooked over 3 dozen eggs in nothing flat and then a couple of dozen pancakes. Just the right size to cook large meals.
5,Great Skillet,"The is an excellent electric skillet. I have owned several different electric skillets and this one is the best so far, it has a huge cooking area and the controls are accurate."
4,Fry Happy,"I read the reviews and on them I bought this pan. I am very, very happy with it. I only wish there was a vent hole in the lid and non-skid feet. To prevent sliding on the counter I filed the roumded edges of the feet flat and added non-skid sick-on strips cut from the edges of non-skid pad sheets. Great skillet! The tempurature control is very accurate and one can pour grease from the pan without slopping all over the legs. This skillet beats the tar out of my old GE skillet."
3,Pretty Good,"This product is pretty good! It cooks wonderfully, but the handles have a cheap feel when you pick the pan up like they are going to break. Overall- for the price it is a great buy!"
1,Beware - Lid Shatters,The skillet lid shattered after using the skillet twice. It shattered when my wife laid it in the drying rack after washing it. Very disappointed in the quality of the product.
3,"okay, but outdated","A week or two after I bought this skillet, a newer model came out that offers significant benefits over this one. The new one has a steam vent in the lid. Amazingly, the pan detaches from the legs for easy cleaning.My skillet performs fine (my only beef is that the control is awkwardly located under a handle, which makes it difficult to operate and hard to read.) But I wish I had known the new one was coming out, as I would have bought it instead."
4,Electric skillet,"Works as advertised. Researched and compared this product to others before purchasing and I would like to thank everyone for providing their input on the product. Works great, have had no issues with it, and it has held up to heavy use for the last year. I believe I got the best value for the price on this purchase."
4,One -and-a-Half Thumbs Up Skillet!,"This electric skillet is one of the better skillets I have purchased. Heats up quickly and evenly. The glass lid is great for ""keeping an eye"" on what's cookin! The only thing that would make this product better would be the ability to attach the lid to the pan."
2,Mistake to have purchased,"Pros: Heats well, Non-Stick is great, Capacity is goodCons: Lid doesn't fit, Lid handle is loose, cord is REALLY shortI wish I would have returned this when I originally bought it a couple of months ago. It's fit is just awful and the cord is so short I have to use an extension cord."
4,Almost Perfect,"When I first started to look for an electric skillet I checked with America's Test Kitchen & read many of the customer reviews at Amazon. The ""Big"" Presto seemed to be the best & so I took a chance. We're very happy with the way it cooks very evenly across it's entire surface & the way it maintains it's cooking temperature. We are very pleasantly surprised by how well it cooks. The only thing we're not crazy about, is because of it's size & shape; it's difficult to empty the used cooking oil. Not sure how they could improve that. Perhaps the kind of ""lip"" you find on a coffee machine carafe. That would make it perfect."
5,Glass cover is great,"Usual high Presto quality. Glass cover is great, as you can see what's cooking without uncovering it."
5,Excellent Service and product,I was very happy with the service and the people I sent the fry pan to were surprised to get my gift and used it right away and were pleased with it!
1,terrible,"it is by far the worst design that presto has come out with.too big and hard to manage when washing. seems to me they could come up with one with a not so big and bulky handles and feet. the older ones they made were greaaat,why change the design when you had something good to begin with. i used it a couple of times aand took it back to the store.please come up with a better onethank youkathy"
2,faulty lid,I found that the lid carckle easily underpressure or deress. Very disesting. Thank you I had be buy another new unit to replace the shatterered unit. All I did was move the lid to another surface and it crakleed into a thousand pieces.
2,too deep,"I purchased this pan to make chicken cutlets but it was so deep that when I went to turn them I burned my forearm. I wanted a normal frypan depth, not something to make a roast in!"
5,Great spacious pan.,"I love this pan - cooks great, cleans easily and is very spacious. I highly recommend it for everyone to use."
4,Plenty of room to cook!,"I need a wide skillet when all five grandchildren come for breakfast or dinner. I like to fry bacon slowly to get it lovely and crisp, and french fries with rosemary are always a big hit. This skillet is an ideal size for a big crowd of kids. I have found it does a better job on the french fries than on the bacon, as there are some areas that are hotter than others and I'm not completely satisfied with the evenness of the doneness. With a deep layer of oil for the French fries it doesn't matter. The fries cook beautifully. The bacon works OK when I turn the themostat just a little hotter than I like it, but you have to be careful to watch and turn it just at the right time. The surface is a cinch to clean, and the glass top is great. All in all a fine value, and a great size."
4,presto is like cooking magic,this presto electric skillet is the best i've ever owned. it's deep and the 16 inches makes it very versatile for all sorts of cooking.one caveat however....like all other electric skillets i've had the handles tend to come loose on a regular basis. this is quickly remedied with a quick twist of a screwdriver.i highly recommend this product.
4,Good as ever,I have been using my 50 year old electric frying pan ( still works) but decided to get a better looking and newer model. This Presto is exactly what I was looking for. Another 50 years?
4,Good Skillet,"Works just as you would hope. There is nothing that blows you away with it, but nothing wrong with it either. Cooks even, heats up quickly, cleans up nice and quick, non-stick surface works nicely, and it cooks bacon without all the splatter. I wouldn't hesitate to buy again."
4,Very well made; excellent value,"This skillet has met all my expectations. The Teflon coating is very sturdy as is the glass top. It is also attractively designed and holds a lot of food. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that I would like to see it get a bit hotter. Even though it heats to 400+ degrees, this doesn't seem quite enough for a quick stir fry. I cooked a whole pound of bacon in it draining the fat half way through. It produced the crispest, best bacon I've had in years. Yum."
2,...nice concept except for the non-stick coating,"We use an electric skillet about 3x's a week. So, this Presto skillet was used on a regular basis. The concept is great...to be able to use the skillet to serve in...is a nice plus. It's attractive enough to put on the table for family dinners. But, the coating began to flake off after about 3 months. The skillet heats quickly and the thermostat was precise. I just wish these manufacturers could get this non-stick coating to STAY ON the skillet. Non-stick is a great plus in a electric frypan...but, I'm looking for Calphalon to introduce an electric skillet. This was my last purchase...i've gone through about 6 different skillets. I'm done with these for now...!!!"
1,Not happy,I ordered this product a year ago. It has been used 2-3 times per week since then. I am very disappointed in this product as the non-stick coating is coming off. I would have liked the skillet to last longer than a year.
4,For Now,"This electric skillet is working well at this point. It is a daily user and it has cooked multiple types of dishes well. The only concern I have is the temperature dial gets stiff and is difficult to set or turn. I would like to be able to review this electric skillet in six months, to see how durable it is."
5,My Secret Weapon,"The size and quality were certainly as expected. I use my electric frying pan quite frequently and the larger size allows me to cook with several meals in mind. The glass lid is such an improvement over my old skillet, and by far the best feature is the ability to immerse the skillet for washing. Great product....great time-saver."
1,it's a toy,"Bostitch does not have a customer review section, that should tell you a lot. The compressor comes with a 1 year warranty. Mine quit just after a year with very light usage. I tore it apart. The 1.3HP motor should not have a ratting of more than 1/8 HP, no heat dissipation, very little fan cooling and then only when running. Just as it needs the most cooling when finishing a compress cycle the fan cooling quits. The motor has PLASTIC bushings! The Max.ambient operating temp. is 94'F. The over temp protection is very cheap and unreliable, mine took over 3 days to reset! The motor has just barely enough power to build enough pressure to shut the motor off from the pressure switch. The diaphragm pump is undersized as well, the last 10 pounds of pressure takes about as long to build as the initial 115 pounds. SAVE YOUR MONEY, this is a way under-designed product, not worth the money at any price."
1,Do not Buy!,"Had unit 18 months, was used maybe a dozen times. Motor froze up. Warranty supports wants me to drive 80 miles and pay to gave it repaired. Don't waste your money!"
1,Works great for short time,"All my good air tools were stolen, including a good Makita compressor, so I decided to buy an inexpensive compressor that wouldn't be such a loss if stolen again. Bought a relatively inexpensive Bostitch that worked well at first, and then bought another rebuilt one for spare. Neither compressor got much use during warranty periods, and both refused to build enough pressure to drive framing nails into southern pine after light to moderate use. Still work OK if using spruce lumber or small finish nails. Good compressor for someone who will never or seldom use it. Sort of like a cheap exercise bike. Good tool to buy if you don't plan to use it much! Basically, it is a junk throwaway tool."
2,Bostitch Compressor Parts are cheap and do not last,"We bought this 6 gallon compressor and have had it for two years with very light use. The regulator knob where you set the psi is plastic and it threads onto a metal pipe, so the threads are quickly eaten up and then the unit will not work. This is a very common problem with these compressors (you can look it up and see many complaints online with the regulator).We tried contacting the 800 service number - who sent us to a local (40 miles away)service center. Of course they will be happy to replace it for parts and labor $ - with another plastic knob that will not last.We have also had to replace the hose that was on the unit. I do not recommend the Bostitch brand of tool or thier service."
1,smells like burning,"I bought this compressor with the trim gun set for a good price at Home Depot. It always smelled kind of funny when it ran but since it was brand new I assumed that's just the way it was. I had it two years with very intermittent use and one day it started to smell worse and worse and start to smoke. Now it won't even cut on. The warranty is up so even though the compressor is basically brand new and broken, I'm out of luck so far.From other reviews I've found online it sounds like this model compressor is a complete dud."
1,Poorly designed compressor,"The regulator WILL break, get another brand. It only lasted 3 months on medium use."
1,Defective from day one,"The very first day I started using it, not even two hours after I ran it for the first time it just ceased. I called the manufacturer and the only other option they gave me besides shipping it back to them was to physically bring it in to a repair shop over an hour away. I got it back two weeks later, and it worked just fine for about a month until it started acting up again to the point that it just wouldn't load beyond 20 PSI.For a less than $ 200 compressor, it is just not worth my time to be on hold for an hour to claim the warranty or drive for an hour to have it fixed yet again.My advice, invest on something more reliable ( I am not blaming the brand, I use Bostitch Nail Guns ) but I know that if had taken the time to research it a little further I would have never have to waste my time or money on this."
3,Not bad but could be better,I bought this compressor about 3 years ago and had the plastic regulator knob broke within 6 month. Took it to a factory repair shop that had it over a month waiting on the part. That same part failed again the other night I am not ordering a replacement from them. I removed the regulator and am using the compressor that way. I may get a off the shelf regulator for the few times I may need it.
2,"OK at 1st, but terrible really","Feb-2014. I have 2 of these. One runs but doesn't compress air; the fittings broke off the other (under pressure, which was fun) so I'm using the 1st one for parts.If I'd known these were made in Italy I'd have not bought them. I have 2 other pancakes: 1) a Sears that's older and been abused and still works great; 2) A cheap Porter Cable that also works great.After a few years of bad experience w/ Bostitch tools - the nail guns also suck - I'd not buy any more.-------------------------------------My initial review:Pros: lightweight, relatively quiet, super-inexpensive.Cons: barely keeps up with my Bostitch NC80 coil framing nailer. Runs almost constantly when framing. It's fine for roofing or finish work but be prepared to work slowly if you're framing and don't even consider using it for 2 people.Net: I wouldn't buy it again and almost asked Amazon to exchange it."
1,Bad Design & Poor Manufacturing Quality,"The unit was a gift. I started using it some months later, after it was out of warranty. On the very first project, it started leaking air at the regulator/switch assembly and would no longer develop pressure. The design of this assembly is very poor. I can see why the factory was not able to assemble it correctly and the reviews are so low (more 1s than 5s). Out-it-goes. No Bostitch purchases for me. I got a Husky, no problem."
3,Handle broke on delivery,"I waited impatiently to get this and when it came the hanldle was in the bottom of the box broke, very disappointed,other than that the product looks great, but the handle causes a problem."
5,Great air compressor,"I use this compressor for site work. It is too small to be run in a shop but at a work site it's great. It can keep up with 2 or 3 guns no problem, and handles an air chuck just fine. The compressor is quite which is rare in an oil less pump design. I like that it has a ball valve on the bottom to drain the water and it is very easy to carry around. It is defiantly the best compressor for the price range."
4,A pretty nice little air compressor for the homeowner!,"I have owned this air compressor for about a year and a half. We built our own home, and I used it quite a bit. If you were going to be using a compressor all the time, you may want one with a little more air capacity so the compressor does not kick on all the time. But for me, this works just fine. And a great price on Amazon to go with it!"
2,Broke after a few months,"First one arrived broken. Amazon took it back and sent a new one. Worked ok for a few months and now runs constantly at about 110 psi when its not even being used. I'm told its a bad piston/valve assembly and now I have to take it to the nearest repair center. Its also pretty loud but comparable to other similar pancake compressors. Anyway, my advise is buy a porter cable if you want something that works for around $150. Sounds like many others would agree."
2,Hopefully it dies tomorrow!,"My home compressor is a Makita Mac2400 which blows this thing out of the water. However, I have to use the bostitch at work. Earplugs are my new best friend. This thing and the portercable pancake are too loud IMO.I have to admit, we run this thing pretty hard bangin in floors all day and it keeps up. It seems to be hard working. Regardless, I can't wait till it breaks."
1,bostitch junk,THE FIRST COMPRESSOR I ORDERED CAME WITH A BROKEN CARRY HANDLE.GUESS WHAT? THE SECOND WAS THE SAME WAY.QUALITY IS NOT IN THIS PRODUCT.
1,Disappointment,"Have been waiting for this item. Delivered today. When I got home I found the box was left upside down, because the bottom of the package had been taped up. When I looked inside, found the handle broken with pieces in the bag. Item looks like it had been repackaged because the staples were open on the bottom and had been taped shut, the top still had the staples in. Will now have to wait for a replacement and another week of waiting or so. Quite possibly they tried pawning one of the other broken handle ones on me based on the other reviews."
1,Don't buy from RFBDirect,BAD RELATIONS WITH RFBDIRECT TRIED TO RETURN MY COMPRESSER BECAUSE OF VERY BAD REVIEWS AND RFBDIRECT WANTED THE COST OF SHIPPING FOR BOTH WAYS PLUS 15%RESTOCKING FEE ABOUT THE COST OF THE COMPRESSOR. I'll NEVER BUY ANYTHING FROM THIS COMPANY AGAIN...EVER
1,Not convinced they work...,"They did make a goopy mess by morning, but it never lessened or changed. Not sure these actually do anything, and haven't found any real research to show that they work."
4,"goodbye modesto, goodbye grandaddy?","if you haven't heard, this is quite possibly the second-to-last grandaddy release. we'll probably get a single or two from next year's album, but jason has said he's movin on and up and out to l.a., leaving grandaddy behind. oh well. he's also said he'll always record music, so that's all i need to know.anyway, on to the e.p. in a word, brilliant. if you're a grandaddy fan there is no way you won't love this. the only reason i gave it 4 stars is the length. need more."
4,love among the ruins,"a really provocative, interestingly written and performed Grandaddy special that manages to touch on some heartbreaking topics in a surprisingly melodic and hypnotic way. Never fear: there is great humor here, as well. I'm not sure that there's anyone else in rock today who so touchingly references human hopefulness in the midst of environmental decline in such a moving and infectious way.Grandaddy are not the same as Flaming Lips, as some misguided reviewers would have you think. They are/were something truly unique and enjoyable who will live on in their substantial repertoire of great music that evokes so many emotions and soothes the soul in multitudinous ways. Long live Grandaddy!!!No one did else did melodies like this."
1,Not Very Comfortable,"Product did not fully meet my expectations but it did arrive in a timely fashion. Very happy with both shipment and service, just not the product. I do not recommend this product as it was not very comfortable to wear for any length of time."
2,"A Celebration of Culture, Not A History Of Sport","I got this book for my soon to be 12 year old nephew who's lives in Newport Beach and already surfs many times a week. But he won't get a lot out of this book. Why? It's more a story of the culture around Surfing (particularly when it was popularized in the mid sixties) than a story of how the sport evolved. There's lots of nostalgia to enjoy if you're 58 years old like me and grabbed your first wave in '63 but, I also know Surfing's history inside out and there's too much missing here to rate this book highly. Any book that supposedly tells the history of Surfing and neither Phil Edwards or Nat Young are mentioned but actress Barbara Eden is 3 times is laughable........."
5,Bad Kitty is a Good Read!,Our son is only 2 1/2 and LOVES this book. He has TONS of books to choose from but each night we MUST read this among the books of the evening. It is a laugh out loud book (especially when you add Kitty's responses). It is a great way to learn the alphabet. The pictures are charming and funny on their own. A real gem to add to your collection. Although I did have to search on the pronunciation of Xigua(lol). We are hoping Kitty has more bad/good days to come!
4,Engaging,"Bad Kitty kept the attention of my 3 1/2 yr old grandson who doesn't like to sit still for any reason. We read the book together, front to back. The range of vocabulary is wonderful, pictures are captivating. In other words it was the best Christmas gift I could have given."
5,Bad kitty,No in uhhBacchus y lecithin y highlight it th it uhh g ivy I ivy it v itching ivihhvhyviyviuyv v hi gigging joking
3,Bad kitty,"Cute character not very fuzzy. I thought it would be soft but it was well made and stiff. If you just want it to display with the book, I would recommend it. It arrived when I expected it."
3,Taught my son to read with Bad Kitty,I am a big fan of Bad Kitty because through these books my son had a desire to read and we did. My only gripe is that I wish the books were longer.
5,Bad Kitty,"My sister is a kindergarten teacher and she said the best thing to buy for a child to get ready for school is ALPHABET BOOKS! Alphabet books that have the upper and lower case as we read more in the lower case. And the more books, the better!! So as a dutiful Grandma I happened to find this one and I just loved that it had a story to it, it was irreverent, funny and I didn't mind reading it over and over again. Lots to talk about in the pictures too with your little one."
1,not what it says,Disappointed ... says 40 pages.... where are the other 20 pages... I think I got ripped off! I hope I can get refunded.
1,What a kitty book,That book is fantastic. I liked how you used expression in your book.You are an amazing writer. I love it.
5,Very funny,My sons repeatedly read the book and enjoy it every time. Please keep writing more! Shipment was fast. Thanks for the great service
3,Wow,"It was great the only thing was... it was short. It would be better if it was longer. And if it were I would give it a five star rating. From,Nia"
2,BAD Kitty,I think this is a cute book and great for the kids.I enjoyed reading this delightful book and hope you do too.
5,ONE OF THE MODERN COUNTRY CLASSICS...,"This album is unbelievable...and really showcases how talented him and his band SLY DOG are...his vocals and songwritng are great and original...the only influence I think that really stands out in his voice and music is WAYLON JENNINGS...who was a good friend of his! Billy has done things his way since he burst onto the scene and that's the way it should be! It is a shame that he gets overlooked. In 2003 all u heard was how TIM MCGRAW used his band on his latest album and everybody made a big deal about it...well BRC has been doing that for a long time now...sorry TIM! People need to get their heads out of their u know what...and finally give this guy some credit...just listen to I AIN'T EVEN LEFT, ENOUGH IS ENOUGH, THE PAST AND GERONIMO and see what I mean(hear his outlaw sensabilities)...that is from all the bashing he had been taking up to that point. Pick this one up and his latest TIME FLIES while you are at it!!!"
1,I'm with Leslie.,"Hate to say it, but I found myself doing the same thing as the reviewer named Leslie: leafing through the book, searching for passages about the author's husband's illness, and not passages where in which she talks about herself. I was disappointed by this book, and found it nearly impossible to care about the people in it. I thought I would have been left thinking more about what became of them and wondering about the author and her family's well-being, but all I thought was, eh."
3,Who's the story about?,"I was a little unhappy with this book. Not because the author isn't a decent writer, but because from the description of the book I thought this book was about the life of a male anorexic. The book, however, is mostly about the authors life (wife of the anorexic), not her husband. I did not buy this book to read about the life of a wife of an anorexic, but to take a rare look into the life of a male anorexic. This book jsut didn't provide that. It is still, over all, a good book, which is why I still gave it 3 stars."
2,Too much who cares info,"A good book about an eating disorder is a fascinating read. This is not that book. Unlucky enough to marry one of the few men with anorexia, Lawrence fails to examine his syndrome, instead wasting pages on her priviliged, but dull, life. Older women who feel trapped in their lives may relate; me, I kept skimming."
4,"Women, past and present","This story about a woman who doesn't feel loved and makes choices based on that feeling mirror some things that I have done in my life. I identified with the author's underlying fears and feelings of inadequacy that made her feel like she deserved the life she ended up with. It inspired me to be careful and make sure I make a choice because it's the best choice for me, not because I fear success or failure. This book reminded me of my mother - how she put up with challenges and a husband that wasn't right for her because she wanted to be a 'good wife, good mother'. It helped me understand why she stayed married to my father when it was obvious she wasn't happy. The author in this book gives so much insight into the motivations of women in her generation. They are worlds away from mine! I loved this book, and I will get my mother to read it. I recommend it to any daughter who's parents have divorced, and any wife who stuck it out way too long."
3,Not all it's supposed to be!,"From the previous reviews I thought that this would be a wonderful book, but I am sorry to say that it's not. The most basic feeling I got out of this book was a depressed feeling about all the trouble the main character has gone through. If you like sob stories then this is good for you, but I wouldn't recomend it to my friends."
2,spelling book,this has been a good book for someone who wants to learn to spell correctly; and it doesn't matter what age you are!
2,Not as good as the first,"I loved Clan of the Cave Bear. All of the different characters and their way of life was interesting and exciting. This book was too slow moving with not enough action, and I was not happy with the character development. I have never not finished a series, but after reading the reviews and seeing them get worse with each book, I've decided to end with this one."
4,A fabulous sequel - Must read!,"This is such a wonderful book that chronicles Ayla's journey alone after being banished from her clan in the first book.The detailing of her fight for survival from the elements in the valley, her encounters with other animals that share the valley as their homes, her on-going struggle to find peace with herself after losing her son and yearning to find her own people and her eventual rescue of her soul mate, Jondalah, is just pure magic to read.The romance, the splendor of the valley and the heart breaking reconcilation of Ayla and Jondalah is just some of the many reasons why this book is a page turner for me.Not for the cynical and jaded."
4,It was a good story,"I read this book, because I wanted to find out what happened to the character from ""The Clan of the Cave Bear"" It was a pretty good story, and the details were amazing, but it was no where near as good as the first book in series. If you are planning to read the whole series, you need to read ""Valley of Horses"" it moves the story forward, and the next 2 books make numerous references to ""the valley"" It is a little slow in places, but once you get in to it, it becomes more interesting."
3,A pretty good but expectable sequel...,"This book lacks the originality of the first book, but it does show a different aspect of the living during the ice age - how the ""others"" had lived, and how a woman can survive all on her own. The book also tries to take a look at how man learned to control wild animals and turn them into the domestic creatures we know today... Even though I'm pretty sure they were not all tamed at the same time by the same person... :0)"
2,Valley of the horses,"This is my 2nd time with Valley of The Horses. I read the story when it first came out in 1982. This time around I listened to the digital audio version from the public library.I guess 20 years ago the frank sexual content did not bother me, but now that I am older, I think it should have been left out of the book. It slows the pace and seems unnecessary to get any points across. Much of the historical culture content that made the first book ""Clan of the Cave Bear"" interesting is lost in the gothic romantic style of this book.Still, it was an interesting book even though I did fast forward through many sections."
3,1/2 Good-1/2 Bad,"I absolutely loved The Clan of the Cave Bear so I was anxious to read this book too. Instead of the historical, informative, bibliography that was so well done in the first book, I found myself reading a trashy romance novel half of the time. I loved the parts about Ayla and her adventures with Whinney and Baby, but I hated the chapters about Jondalar and his brother. SEX SEX SEX. WHY? WHY? WHY? was all that necessary?I hope the next one will be better."
1,Cave Bear Crap,"Clan of the Cave Bear was good. I would recommend it. This book is pure crap, and reads like a cheap romance novel. It is boring, repetitive, and trite. Characters are stereotypical, and the dialog belongs more in a bad twentieth century soap opera. I feel compelled to get the star rating for this book lower...since it is listed as a 4!!!"
4,More descriptive than Clan of the Cave Bear...,"especially the first half of the book, where perhaps too much emphasis is in immersing the reader in the setting, at the expense of plot. The first half of the book took me 6 days to read, which whilst not boring it was easy to put the book down. The second half of the book I read in one sitting as the plot & pacing of the book became Auel's primary focus. The first book was excellent & this is nearly as good & should definitely be read if you enjoyed the first. Ayla is a wonderful character & Jondalar isn't far behind."
2,Repetitious,"First off, I liked Clan of the Cave Bear because of its imagination. This book is not as good. For one thing, everything in the book gets repeated, and then repeated again, and then repeated again. We aren't stupid, we got it the first time. For another, about 2/3 of the book is spent romanticizing an entirely unbelievable new character (Jondalar) who we don't even care about until at least mid-way through the book.I found myself skipping entire pages and never missing having read them.Maybe the Mammoth Hunters will be better. We'll see."
1,Yuck,"An out and out bad book. The dialogue is corny, and the scenes are quite boring especially those with Jondalar and Thonolan. I skipped a lot of pages because I couldn't bear to read through their dumb scenes. It's supposed to be prehistoric times but these two characters talk like they're in 2002 L.A. with the main goal of scoring on women. Pretty [bad]. How this book ever got good reviews from the critics is beyond me. The only interesting scenes are those with Ayla. Clan of the Cave Bear is really good but don't waste your time on this one."
2,Jean Auel turns to a smut author?,"I, like many others, really liked Clan of the Cave Bear. I liked Valley of Horses up til the latter half when the wanton and repetitive, graphic sex began. I mean, I don't mind an occasional sex scene in a book, but this got to the point of monotony. It continues in The Mammoth Hunters which I was unable to finish. I found myself skipping over the sex scenes to get to the plot which became repetitive in itself. The author tries too hard to make Ayla into a superwoman and Jondalar into the ultimate ladies man. Then when they get together, they become bumbling idiots who can't even look at each other without jumping in the sack. I was so disappointed with the direction the author decided to go with this series."
4,Not as good as it could have been.,"Uummm...A little too much sex for me, an 8th grader. Swithcing on and off on Ayla's and Jondalar's life was a little bit bothersome. I liked the part where Ayla lived alone and adopted her two pets, but the trust between Baby and herself is a little curious."
3,Mediocre follow up to Clan,I agree with the reader from Calif...Auel's novels degenerate quickly after Clan. The next one is worse yet...
5,Audio books at there best.,"I was pleasantly surprised when I bought this book, It is well read by Sandra Burr even with some mis-pronounced words, but having said that I have noticed other readers make the same sort of mistakes because they are trying so hard to be as clear and concise as possible in the reading.I especially liked the fact that there are separate discs so if you take note of the chapter you finished at when you want a break it's easy to get back into the story. I will certainly be looking for the other titles in this series by Jean M. Auel read by Sandra Burr."
3,Older CD may not work great in newer equipment,"I was looking for a digital download but this whole series had been recently pulled from Itunes and audible. Several of the CD's would not play in my car CD player but i was able to download to my Itune library. The info on the CD from online source was incorrect and had to be enterde manually for almost all of the CD's and the 100 tracts per CD. A bit of a pain, but I enjoyed reading the series when it came out and the audio version was great once technical issues were overcome. Amazon ordering and delivery was flawless."
4,Good book,"I think this book was good. I haven't read the first one (The Clan of the Cave Bears) but I have read the other books. Unfortunately I have to admit that they don't better. But I liked The Valley of Horses very much specially the survivel part when Ayla lived alone in the Valley with her animals, because it was so exiting."
4,Great 30 yr adventure,Jean Auel has taken us for a ride. With Alya as a guide.Book was received in a timely fashion and in good shape.
4,Some errors in translation...,"I love this book! I own the hard cover and have read it several times and was looking forward to having it on my kindle. Unfortunately I have found that there are several errors in the Kindle version. Most of the errors have to do with punctuation, but there are some spelling errors as well. A majority of these typos seem to be in the last half of the book. I am no expert in grammar or spelling but if I can notice these errors it makes me wonder if the person doing the editing started skipping over parts the farther along they got.All in all I absolutely love the book, and I would have no problem giving it 5 stars if it wasn't for the typos."
5,wonderful...couldnt set it down.,if you like a story with a heroine in it youll love this ayla is great i just couldnt stop reading
3,Lots of typos in the the Kindle edition,"First of all, I have to say that I enjoy this book--if you haven't figured it out already from the other reviews, it's light, easy-to-read, entertaining fiction. Auel certainly did her research and there are passages I skim over b/c they go on and on in tedious detail about the grasslands, the glacier, the animals. The book (and her others) can definitely read like an encyclopedia entry. That aside, I do like the stories and have reread them many times.My rating, though, is for the quality of the Kindle edition... I'm sure they used OCR to convert the printed book to electronic and it appears that they did virtually no spell-checking. Not the end of the world, but it interrupts the flow of the story (even more than the repeated references to Jondalar's ""blue eyes"" and ""prodigious member"")."
2,sucks you in...and spits you right out,"Well, Clan of the Cave bear was interesting enough...but then, once you get over the amazement of ""wow! this seems just like New York!"", you start to see flaws...still, I read Valley of the horses...same thing, except here, they're taller, and can't keep their hands off each other...come on! 4 times in one chapter....sheesh!Also, doesn't this seem a bit too advanced for the Paleolithic period? or is that just me?? a spear thrower...why not! after all, we've already figured out how to strike fire, and set up a society where you screw over who ever you see..."
1,Kindle edition is riddled with typos,"The typos are many and distracting. I gave up reading it on the Kindle and picked up the hardback version. The book is a great sequel to Clan. Looking forward to the new one, but won't be buying it on the Kindle."
2,What a let-down!,Clan of the Cave Bear was a great book. I rushed right out to get Valley of the Horses and continue the adventure. What trash! It was boring and read like a cheap romance novel.
2,Too much sex,"I'm totally not a prude, however the frequent sex scenes became tiresome. The author obviously did a lot of research for her books, yet I found myself skimming pages as she droned on and on about the flora, fauna, and techniques of caveman survival. I think I'm done with the Earth's Children books."
4,what drew me to the book...,"I read the first book and instantly fell in love with Ayla and the craziness of her life. I couldn't wait to find out what happens to her next so I immediately bought the second book. Although the books are quite long and at times can seem to only contain descriptions of the character's worlds and routines, the author manages to work in exciting tidbits and details of the character's story lines through the vast explanations. You are literally just reading chapter by chapter till Ayla and Jondalar meet. Just when you think you can put this book down and pick up another it snags your attention and you are completely engrossed once again. The book can definitely be quite explicit at times just like the first but once you move past this fact all you want to do is keep reading to find out what happens."
5,Finding a Self,"THE VALLEY OF HORSES by Jean M. Auel is my favorite of the Children of the Earth series.Ayla is banished from the Clan and must leave her son behind. She escapes to a hidden valley where she finds shelter and food. Most importantly she explores herself as an individual apart from the Clan. She makes friends with animals and rescures a man who is much like herself.A slow read that is forever fresh.Nash Black, author of SANDPRINTS OF DEATH"
2,"Great Book, Terrible Narration","Valley of the Horses is one of my favorite in the series and I was thrilled to see this at the library. After twenty minutes, I gave up trying to listen. The female narrator is really annoying to the point I was unable to focus on Auel's terrific story."
4,Whoa! I didn't expect that!,"Okay, I just recently finished reading Clan of the Cave Bear, or the fisrt book in this series, and thought it was good. I read this, and got to the ""Rites of Pleasure"" part, and about gagged myself with a large spork. Jesus, I am thirteen, and that is about the dirtiest thing I have ever read in my life. It is like Porn in a book."
1,Not for kids!,"I really enjoyed this book long ago. However, i did a search for children's audio books and this was on it! Hello!!! There is explicit sexual stuff in this book. I gave it a one star for the stupidity of the person that put it under children's audio. Please don't get this for your children thinking it is something educational (historical fiction)."
1,Got Hosed!,I am glad I had the chance to do this. I have sent e-mails to Amazon 2 times and the seller once. I ordered 2 books before Xmas. One came in January and the other still has not showed. I would not buy another product from them if I owned the company!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2,Have seen better,"The Clan of the cave bears is a great book, I could not put itdown while reading it. Then I started reading this book. I wonder if the same person wrote these two books ! The book started alright, then Ayla met jondalar, and the rest of the book was about sex."
5,Audio enjoyment,I love the Earth Childrens series - but I must admit that I enjoy the audio's more. Good rader - wonderful story
2,Other Books,"Stoneage Romeos.With one big difference. The album by the Hoodoo Gurus is brilliant, the book isn't even remotely close to that, in fact several stars out of 5 not so.This veers well into really, really boring romance novel territory. It may be supposed to be like that, but at that length, it gets really tedious, really, really quickly. Avoid it, unless that is what you are looking for, as smart guy and smart girl lust after each other across Neanderthal territory."
3,Way Boooooring,"The only reason I gave this 3 stars is because it was the next book in the series and continued Ayla's story well.As for action, it was kind of there. Pretty okay tale until Ayla gets with ""her man"". It really did the book in toward the end with all the silly bickering Jondalar did with her. I found myself sighing with frustration wondering when it will end. ""Oh she isn't looking at me so I guess she doesn't want me."" ""Oh Jondolar isn't looking at me so I know he hates me."" Chapter after chapter of this b.s. almost made me stop listening. Grow up you two and get on with it!The first book was great, I only read/listened to it because I saw the movie. Now that I listened to the second, I have stopped completely. Jondalar is a wuss, and Ayla seems to get a bit wimpy too.Disappointing.For the reader, I've heard more pleasant voices. Burr doesn't have a smooth sound like Donada Peters, the woman who read Clan of the Cave Bear. Grab her version rather than Burr."
4,"BUENA SECUELA, MUY BUENA.","Un resúmen:El clan del oso cavernario: EXCELENTE, INSPIRADOR.El valle de los caballos: BUENA SECUELA, RECOMENDABLE.Léanlo, si leyeron el primero, vale la pena...COMPRENLO.Los cazadores del mamut: SOLO PARA FANS.El libro de los viajes (""Plains""): REPETITIVO, LENTO Y ABURRIDO EN DOS TERCERAS PARTES (LA'ÚLTIMA PARTE, COMO EN ""cazadores"", PARA FANS).....LA ESPERANZA....""The Shelter of stone""...donde los que admiramos a Ayla, esperamos reencontrarnos con ella..."
4,My favorite of the Earth's Children Series,Ayla's development is revealed to her as it is to the reader. She becomes the person she will be throughout her series of ongoing adventures/ life.
2,Good but repetitive,I realy enjoyed the first book and enjoyed this one as well. My only regret is that it is sooooo repetitive. I realy got tired of hearing Ayla's ideas of where babies come from. I have read the entire series and firmly believe that if the author took out all the repitition it would turn out to be TWO very compelling and enjoyable books. I hope the author takes into consideration this recurring complaint from her readers and keeps the flashbacks to a minimum on her next endevour. I eagerly await her next book.
5,It doesn't get any better than this!!!,"This is the best book in the Earth's Children series thus far. The details that some have scoffed at, make this story all the more believable. I love ALL of these well researched details; from the description of the steppes to the description of each plant and its uses. No where have I found a story more touching or brought to life in such vivid and colorful detail. Ayla is strength, fierce courage, gentleness, and naivete` all wrapped into one. As for Jondalar; this world sure could use a few more of his kind. The passion between these prehistoric lovers is hot enough to make the pages ignite. Like I said before; it doesn't get any better than this."
5,Better than ever,"You thought clan of the cave bears could not be topped? Guess again, and add some good crys for the romance and love/sex scenes. This was UNREAL. Don't worry about some bad reviews you see here. They are from men who know they could not possibly match up to Jondalar, so they have their ego speaking. I have yet to find someone, female OR male, who did not like it and learned a little something in the process. After all, this is how every woman would like to be loved...."
1,Here we go again - Romance among the woolly mammoths.,"Like its predecessor, 'The Clan of the Cave Bear' this novel is well-written but ethnocentric. The archaic Homo sapiens (Neanderthals) have disappeared, which is a pity considering their rich culture and belief system. Instead we have the person who is deemed worthy of being Ayla's mate - a tall, blond, blue-eyed Cro-Magnon like herself, who could show Don Juan a thing or two when it comes to sex. The happy couple also invent the spear-thrower and learn how to light a fire with flint - in the process Jondalar of the amazing virility meets the only woman who can love him. Try a Harlequin, they're cheaper.On the plus side, 'The Mammoth Hunters' and 'The Plains of Passage' are bad enough to make this book look good."
4,Sequel to Clan of the Cave Bear,"""The Valley of Horses"" is Jane Auel's sequel to ""Clan of the Cave Bear."" ""Clan"" is by far the better book, but ""The Valley of Horses"" is a worthy sequel (and there are several books to follow this one).When we left ""Clan of the Cave Bear,"" the heroine was a modern version of man living among a dying species. ""The Valley of Horses"" helps the heroine find more people like herself for the first time, and she meets Jondular and falls in love. (The sex gets incredibly steamy -- it just didn't seem to fit.)Overall, a good book. Good enough, in fact, that it successfully lead me to the next book in the series, ""The Mammoth Hunters."""
2,"Sorry, but i have to agree with the negative reviews","I have read all of Jane Auel's Earth's Children's books and this one is only slightly better than The Mammoth Hunters, which is awful.I absolutely loved Clan of the Cave Bear and have reread it no less than 12 times since it was first published. Unlike Clan, the middle two books are brain candy. It's like Auel is being forced to write a bad tv sitcom.Fortunately, it gets better with Shelters of Stone. Maybe every author really does have only one great novel in them?"
3,Average,"What i have to say is that this book is not as good and compelling as the ""The Clan of the Cave Bear"" i had to stop reading it...i couldnt go throuh with it. I intend to try it again some day in the future, maybe i can see it in a different perspective."
3,Painstakingly slow start,"Besides the very slow start, it was very enjoyable to read. I was sitting on the edge of my seat waiting for certain things to happen through the first 80% of the book! But it led into the third book very nicely."
4,The Valley of Horses by Jean M. Auel,"I have only just begun with this book but found Clan of the Cave Bear, the first book in the series, to be great. I'm sure this book will be to my liking."
3,Adventure and Romance,"First, I think that Auel is a fantastic writer. The amount of research that she does for her books, and the rumored number of rewrites that she's done as new information surfaces makes the books in this series very good - you know that when she describes how they hunt that that was how it was done. The characters are great; well developed and likeable people. and the storyline is original (or it was at the time it was written, these days everyone is churning out historial fiction).With that said, let me say that the book reads like Tami Hoag's first thriller ""Lucky's Lady"", in that it features a lot of sex for no reason at all. It's obvious that much of the sex in the storyline is gratuitous, almost all of it unnecassry to further along the plotline."
1,Stone age soap opera,"I had heard a lot about this series over many years and looked forward to reading it but had not got around to it. I finally read The Valley of Horses (I have not read The Clan of the Cave Bear, and now I never will) and could not believe how bad it is. I don't recall ever coming across a less convincing attempt to recreate the language, relationships and culture of another time. It is as if the author took a script for a 1980s soap opera, changed a few words and offered it as a rather poor parody of a stone age story - except that it is not intended to be a parody. I am sorry I wasted my time reading this (...) when there are so many great books I could be reading."
5,Fast Service,Received fast and in excellent condition. Worth reading a second time. Would recommend this and her other books to anyone interested in people of long ago.
5,Repeat Offender,As a rule I do not ever reread a book. But I make a exception with Jean Auel's books. In fact I re-read the first 3 books every other year. I do not know why the books are empowering but they just are and I highly recommend them. I ordered a copy of this book for my Kindle App on my iPhone. I love to read at lunch or waiting in line or waiting for the train to pass or waiting for an appointment. And as I always have my phone handy well then that means I always have a good book handy. And this is a good book (#2 in series).
2,"YIKES...hard to believe the smae author wrote ""Clan of the Cave Bear""",I found this mostly tedious....lots of overwhelming and BORINGdescriptions of things...little interesting character development..BUT if you are interested in Ayla's story...it serves thatpurpose superficially
4,Not as good as the first book.,"I really enjoyed the first book of the earth's children series and could not wait to get hold of the next one. This book was a lot slower than the first one and, at some points, it gets a little bit boring. However, overall, this was a good book with plenty of description and thorough detail that allows you to really transport yourself to the early days of the homo sapiens, also giving you an interesting point of view of how these first men used to behave and their way of living in society."
5,The Valley of Horses,Unbelievably awesome and so hard to put down. An experience no-one should miss. Every word a self feeling of reality.
2,The sex book,"I tried really hard to like this book, but the first half really drags. Let's see what we've got here - Ayla talks to herself, weaves, invents the lighter and livestock domestication. On the other side of Europe, Jondalar and his brother wander through villages having graphic sex with pretty girls. They also get injured a lot and get drunk/stoned a couple of times. Oh yeah, and we find out that the Others don't like the Clan. Oy vey.Finally, Jondalar hooks up with Ayla. Oh boy! maybe things will pick up for the second half! Overall, they do, but Ms. Auel needs to be introduced to the black marker in the worst way. In short, the book is necessary reading if you want to understand the rest of the series, but it's really just a transition book. It could have been a lot more."
3,"A good story, but...","I bought this after reading the Clan of the Cave Bear. The rich culture that Auel creates in that novel left me hungry for more, but unfortunately this falls flat. The first half is a tale of survival that I really got into, however the second one seemed a bit hard to swallow. There are quite a few harlequin romance undertones throughout, and the story loses its realitic edge when you have two perfect people dicovering how to make fast fires, tame horses, invent the bow...oh and learn to talk almost overnight.In addition, this ebook suffers from quite a few typos, mostly missing periods. There are a few places where the word is entirely wrong, such as ""tune"" instead of ""time""."
4,Kindle Version has problems,"I have all the hardbacks - and love them!I wanted a kindle version, so I ordered it (Valley of Horses)What I found was that this must have been a scanned version - there are SO MANY typos, it's unbelievable!e.g., tune instead of time; Jetximo instead of Jetamio; just to point a couple.Don't get me wrong, I love the books and can't wait for the Painted Caves. But I think that Jean Auel would be aghast if she knew that her books on kindle are prepared so shoddily.I have prepared 5 novels for kindle and it's not that hard. Someone should get their act together and do it right instead of rushing to get the novel on kindle."
5,Beautiful and heart-renching,"The Valley of Horses has the revered spot on my bookshelf. Ayla is so beautiful and masterful, so full of thought and emotion. The whole story transports you and you long to be hunting with Ayla. For students learning about early man, this is highly reccomended, though it is fiction. Fairly graphic, so children under 13 shouldn't read it."
2,Is this really the prehistoric era?,"First let me say that I loved Clan of the Cave Bear and had great hopes for this one. Boy, was I let down. I found myself arguing with and complaining to the author as I read. As a student of prehistoric human culture, I found the portrayal of these characters' culture to border on the absurd. Everyone is well-fed, because hunting and gathering are so incredibly easy. Whenever a tool or device is needed, the characters simply invent it! Marriage ceremonies, domestication of animals, and the building of boats are the extracurricular activities of these Ice Age peoples, since no one is too preoccupied with the business of surviving. And let's talk about building boats, since the author does; slowly, uninterestingly, and for an entire chapter that you can just skip if you want to - you won't miss a thing (except a few yawns). The size of Jondalar's member is also discussed more frequently than is needed. Overall, this is a poor addition to the series."
4,"liberated woman, sensitive man, in prehistoric costume drama","I remember reading this several years ago--and I must regretfully admit I did read it all the way through.But I never read another of Ms. Auel's books. Couldn't. My one-word review to friends? ""Paleoporn!"" Seems to me that in 20 years it will be laughably apparent that this fable is not about prehistory at all, but about the free and independent fantasy woman we wish we could be, and the perfect relationship we'd like to have with that supremely sensitive and sexy man. For those who want their bodice ripping adventures to have a little extra in the way of costume drama and historical research, I guess this would be a treat, but I have to say I found it hilariously anachronistic and soon-to-be dated. Any historian could nail this production within a five-year period of its publication. I think Ayla probably looks sort of like Gloria Steinem...don't you?"
2,Where is the 'Clan of the Bear' writer?,"More than half of this book is like reading two different books, one chapter at a time. In one of them, Ayla is Isaac Newton of her era. No wonder Jondalar confused her as a Donii. In the other part you learn about the sexual adventures of two young men. The end of the book is all about sex. Don't get me wrong, I like sex stories, but not when they do not add anything to the story. This book could be much more about the clashing of the Clan and the Others cultural references. It actually gave me some hope when Jondalar and Ayla met. But some chapters later she learns Jondalar's language in a nightmare and from then on it's all about solving relationship problems.I read the reviews of the next 3 books and I'm really disappointed. What happened to Broud? What happened to Durc? Why is Durc the next step of the Clan? And finally, who wrote the first book?"
1,TOO FILLED WITH SEX FOR HIGH SCHOOL LIBRARIES,I CAN'T SAY THAT I READ THE BOOK I ONLY SKIMMED IT SINCE MY DAUGHTER BROUGHT IT HOME FROM HER H.S. LIBRARY. I WAS SHOCKED AT THE EXPLICIT SEX. FOR ADULTS THE BOOK IS FINE BUT I WOULD LIKE TO SEE LIBRARIANS MORE AWARE OF ITS CONTENT AND NOT LET CHILDREN HAVE ACCESS TO IT.
3,romance in the ice age.,"Ayla is banished from the Neanderthal clan that raised her. After Iza and Creb's deaths, Ayla has nothing to hold on to her ""cousins"" anymore except her son. She manages to find a cave where she can live a while before restarting her search for ""The Others"". She befriends a horse and a lyon.So far so good.But what I disliked about this book are the Jondalar and Thonolan characters... Specially Jondalar. He is so ""perfect"" it is very annoying. The countless sex scenes were a bit out place and quite boring to be honest.Besides,Ayla inspite of being ""self sufficient"" gives everything up to be with a man who is not even worth it. I guess cavewomen were not much smater than some of the women in modern times... But I see this book as a transition book, a link to the third volume of the series which is way better in my opinion."
1,Valley of Horses,"After reading 85-90 percent of Valley of Horses,book would not allow me to continue. Instead, I got an advertisement and would not proceed forward. I could not finish the book. I hope you can help me.Fran"
4,The equal sequel,"Without the large cast of supporting characters in ""Clan of the Cave Bear,"" this one gets more up close and personal with Ayla and her aloneness after being banished from the Clan. The contrasts between the way she obviously views herself and the way Jondalar views her are very interesting, showing that her life with the Clan afforded her little or no sense of self. Their confrontation over the fact that she has borne an ""abomination"" rings so true. To me Auel writes of certain things, even bad things like discrimination, and depicts them as flaws in our nature that did not just develop with complex societies. It's very rewarding to read about Ayla learning about herself and developing the talents that the Clan punished her for. And the sex scenes...can't say I've ever read anything that graphic. Talk about steamy. But in a lot of ways it highlights the naturalness and the basic-ness of these people."
4,Captivating Series,"Valley of the Horses is second of the series written by Jean M. Auel. The first is The Clan of the Cave Bear which is fabulous. Valley of the Horses is good, definitely worth the time spent reading, but Cave Bear is better. I loved reading the author's view of how horses could have been domesticated early in human history and the weight they took off of everyday living. Good Read!"
5,Captivating.,"Definitely a guilty pleasure, but pleasurable none the less. The first half (Ayla until Baby; Jondular until Thonolan's marriage) is close to the best section of the entire series. The last quarter after the two stories converge is quite fun. The third quarter isn't very good and I actually skipped it the first time I read the book (without any real loss). Worth it for the fantasy, not really for the writing or for the story itself."
4,Satisfying sequel to Clan of the Cave bear,"The story in the first book was more interesting to me, but this continuation of Ayla's adventures is also a rather interesting and satisfying read if a bit slow at times, and serves more like a bridge to the third book than a full story on its own. Even though I call it a 'bridge'. this book is more than, and is satisfying and fun to read. A solid 4/5 stars."
4,Adorable backpack - tons of fun to play with,Any child would love this adorable backpack. It rolls and can be carried and is just the right size for preschool or trips for a small child.
5,L-Bag,"Have used this exact model in the past, but current Dr. does not use these. Great size, straps, and valve."
2,2nd set blues,I had purchased these glasses a couple years ago for my wife for Christmas. We were so happy with them that my wife suggested that I get an additional set again this year. However we were very disappointed when we opened the box to find that the glasses were not of the same quality they were 2 years previously. The crystal is inferior quality and the color is not as vibrant. This will also make it harder to use both sets at the same time.
3,Gloriously okay!,"Without a doubt, the Escalante River is worth writing about. It's a thin ribbon of shallow, silty water that winds a crooked course among some of the most beautiful slickrock and sandstone walls this side of Mars. It's got reeds, arches, beaver dams, sunlight, and the remnants of forgotten people. It's one of the most amazing places on earth, and it deserves volumes written in praise of it.That said, that's what this book's about.So, it's got to be at least okay, right?Don't worry. It is.It's okay.It's got a good chapter on touring Glen Canyon Dam, a nice piece on the mystery of missing artist Everett Ruess, and some good descriptions of the rocks and plants and wildlife.It does drag on at points, though--as slow and muddy and meandering as the river the author's writing about....But maybe that's what he was going for."
5,Florida Atmosphere,"Adventure against the lush Florida wilderness. I grew up here and have lived eleswhere, and wild Florida is very wild indeed. Lea Grambling has a sure command of his art, accurate and efficient in his discription of an environment that many who even live in Florida cannot imagine, brisk and commanding in his plot, and hard edged in his action scenes.I was inspired to run out and explore the nearest swamp, but I was too busy turning pages."
5,Great product,"Very good/sturdy net for use on smaller bed trucks. It is limited to the dimensions given since it doesn't stretch like the bungee nets. However, be warned that the bungee nets are TERRIBLE unless you like untangling things for the fun of it and this nylon net doesn't tangle nearly as easily. Very easy to use with bungee cords provided or with four standard bungee cords. Recommended!"
4,Cargo Net,This was a gift for my son and he loves it! Very sturdy and maneuverability is great to change possible configuration changes.
3,What a mess. Is it a net or a puzzle?,"I bought this when Amazon dropped the price down to $10. I own a short bed pickup and thought this would be perfect in certain situations. The two times I went to use it I was scratching my head at what to do and how to hook it up and I'm normally pretty hands on kind of guy... It may sound easy but it comes with parts that aren't easily figured out and the two times I went to use it I didn't have two hours to figure out how it all went together and latched down. The instructions were either non existent or just written very horrible, don't remember as it's been like 6 months since I've tried to use it.Going camping this summer and I'm definitely going to take this thing out again and carefully examine it and will update the review then."
4,A great new single,"I really adore ""Come Home Billy Bird,"" the lead-off single from the Divine Comedy's new album ""Absent Friends."" It's bouncy, jaunty, and be-lyricked delightfully. It sounds nothing like the rest of the album, though, and the b-side ""Idaho"" (a somber, somewhat overwrought number that clearly deserves it place as a B-side) is another thing entirely, heavily orchestrated and heavy on Mr. Hannon's exquisite vocal impact."
5,Very nice product,"REally nice when bought as a package with table cloth, place mat and napkins. Add class to any eating area"
2,DOESN'T GET ANYWHERE!,"I'd suggest sticking with 'tilt' because this is a big let down. The musicianship is superb as is the production but the tracks are over before they've begun. Some lasting over a couple of minutes before ending. With Jazz/fusion you expect relatively long tracks to give the musicianships a chance to show off their chops, but on this apart from one or two tracks it doesn't happen. There are very few solo's if any. A shame because the ideas are brilliant in a sub-mahavisuna text. Imagine 'inner mounted flame' crossed with 'hot rats' without the solo's and this about sums it up. I was dissapointed because it just doesn't get anywhere or is never given the chance because of the pitiful length of each song. There is fifteen of them so that about sums it up. What a wasted oppertunity."
2,Dated.,This Arti & Mestieri recording is nowhere near as good as their 1976 release Tilt. This recording which pre-dates Tilt by a couple of years is a far busier affair with a pronounced emphasis on the horn section. The tunes are just not compelling or memorable. As their sound matured they became increasingly more enjoyable. This recording proves that impressive musicianship alone is not enough to carry a recording as it comes off as a poor man's fusion era-Zappa. Give this one a pass and go instead to Tilt...Simon
5,"Subtle melodies, rich music; full poetry, daily language!","""Rumo"" was the name of a group of musicians from Sao Paulo, the biggest brazilian city, whose songs explore the music that arises from the spoken Portuguese language. They follow the steps of Noel Rosa, the best samba's composer ever, although with renewed sensibility. I've been a Rumo's admirer since its very beginning, in early 80's. I'd love to read someone else's opinion: how does it sound to a non-Portuguese speaker? ""Rumo"" does not exist anymore, but its members followed their own ""solo"" carrers: Luis Tatit, Na' Ozzeti, Helio Ziskind, Paulo Tatit, and others."
2,Not Historiclly Accurate and Cheaply Made,"If memory serves me correctly this was an ABC Movie of the Week film. This film like the 1991 Bugsy film is a Hollywoodized phony biography of Siegel and Hill. Hill is shown in this film as a savvy woman who came from the hills of Kentucky to make a life for herself. She was in fact from Georgia and had what one woman called ""the mouth of a truck driver"". Hill was one of the original Hollywood drug dealers. Her main line were Amphetamines supplying even poor Judy Garland and numerous other stars who needed to stay thin and used her services. Siegel built the Flamingo with Lucky Lucianos's heroin trade profits. It never amazes me how Hollywood loves to glamorize 1940's gangsters. Dyan Cannon was horribly miscast as Hill. Keitel plays Siegel in this film and was actually better than Warren Beatty's performance in Bugsy, Keitel is in that film also."
2,Marginally fun,"Pro's: Great variety, level of challenge, and good ideas.Cons: Sometimes lessons are very obscure without being practical. Assembly language is the devil.I read it several times to make sure I understood it, and what it was trying to show."
1,FDA Recall!,Be aware that the FDA has issued a recall for this design because the paint has LEAD in it! These are made in China and the FDA issued a press release 4/28/08.
3,Gadget! Good Clean Fun!,"Inspector Gadget is at it again, with a review of his favorite doodads and crackpot crime fighting tools. You and your family will love this video, and watch it over and over."
2,Not Nearly As Good As Push Not The River,"I absolutely fell in love with James Conryod Martin's novel, Push Not the River. I couldn't stop flipping the pages to see what horrible misadventure and life lesson the countess would learn in the coming chapters. It was like peering at a bad car accident. A real guilty pleasure.However, this sequel left me sorely dissappointed. While the first novel was mostly the story of the countess' personal life adventures, this novel was essentially a war story. In fact, it seemed at one point like Napoleon was the main character. Also, the characters' personalities seemed to change dramatically from one book to the next, which made it difficult to buy into.I highly recommend reading Push Not the River, which was actually based on the countess' diary, and leave the cliffhanger ending to your imagination. Skip the sequel."
1,"Against a Crimson Sky"" A novel","I have not received this product. According to account information, it has shipped and was due to reach me about Feb 2, 2010. Today is Feb. 10, 2010."
5,Great Historical Fiction,"""Against a Crimson Sky"" left me longing for a trilogy as much as its predecessor ""Push Not the River"" left me longing for this sequel. This book brings history during the Napoleon era to life. If you like historical fiction such as Leon Uris's ""Trinity"" or ""Exodus"" you will love these novels too. ""Against a Crimson Sky"" is a captivating story with exceptionally well written historical connections. I wish I could see the movie!"
4,Good history,Good history lesson on Poland during the revolution. It is the second book written about the same family. Read Push Not the River first.
1,completely dented,This arrived with 8 dents in it I'm so angry. Costs more to ship back. So disappointed. should have been cool.
3,The Bad Time,&#65533;The Mean Time&#65533;is a book about a kid named Luke that moved to a school that racism was going on and the kids at the school would make fun of him and say he didn&#65533;t belong and he&#65533;s just a little black kid. One night Luke&#65533;s family was having dinner and boom! A rock went through their window and they saw the white kids scramble away running very fast.I didn&#65533;t really like this book because it had too much racist things like saying bad words and saying that you don&#65533;t belong. I think that some people would be very offended by this book. The fighting in the book remained me of the book the outsiders I liked The Outsiders a lot more than The Mean Time
4,Good tool for the money,"I bought this drill as a part of a larger battery operated power tool set, and for the price I paid, I've been happy with this tool.Althought it might be a tad heavy, it's tackled many jobs around our house. It's been about 3 years now, and one of the two battery packs has ceased to work, and the other one has worn down a little bit.It seems to be a little heavy at times when the work is shoulder height and above. That would probably be my only criticism given the pricepoint."
2,the drill is great but the charger is a bust,"The charger for the model CL180 always tended to overheat when plugged in...and finally lasted less than two years despite only light use. And it seems to be unavailable for separate purchase. So apparently I get to throw away a perfectly good, nice, cordless drill for want of a charger!"
3,Vintage Louis Lamoure,"The legend of Louise Lamoure lives on through this epic tale. Lando Sackett emerges from the shadows of the Tennessee mountains, proving his manhood as he tries to piece together the mysterious history of his long lost father. As this tale unfolds you will find yourself swept away as Lando is faced with unbelievable odds, waist deep in the middle of a ruthless treasure hunt fighting for his life."
2,I have seen better,I have read better Outdoor Leadership books. This one is VERY wordy. Koseff's book is much clearer and easier to read
4,Pryor in his embryonic stage,"Much of this consists of early versions of routines that he would later make famous. The Preacher routine is the forerunner of the more concise (and funnier) ""Our Text For Today"" on ""Is It Something I Said."" Some of this may also be found on the video ""Live And Smokin'"" from around the same time (1971). The bits oabout ""Oilwell,"" The Osmond Brothers/Jackson 5, that N---r's Crazy, etc. are all forerunners of what was to come."
5,Exactly what I wanted,These braces replaced the one I received from my Doctor after my ankle injury. It was exactly the same brace. It works just great for me.
4,I'm confused,"I'm sorry I haven't read the book yet, but I've seen the movie and at the end the audience is told Mr. Jung won't be released until the year 2015. However, the Kirkaus review says he is free, delivering seafood on the East coast! Could someone please clear this up for me."
3,"It's okay, the movies better","Like I said, the movies better. This may be the tell-tale truth but you'll find that it is a complete 180 from the movie. If you've seen the movie, you're bound to get confused during the reading. A lot of this book is jumping back and forth, more fact than story-telling. George Jung was definitely a huge player in the cocaine business, though I think he is rather over-rated as a public star. I found myself during this book reading a paragraph three times over but finally going to the next with ""this doesn't make sense"". A good book in the aspect that it's the true account of the life of George young. If you really want to know about the business and others like it, search elsewhere for detail."
4,Too much- Too often,"Such daring! Reads like a fiction that couldn't be true, but is!!! I felt sorry for him in the end... But what a ride while it lasted."
4,"great book, snowblind even better","i agree with all the above reviewers. this book had good detail about the drug trade and was a riveting story. however, i think snowblind by robert sabbag was even better. Sabbag is a more skilled writer than Porter. Too bad this movie did not turn out as good as the book, but isn't that usually the case?"
4,A real page turner,"George Jung is widely acknowedged as the man who introduced cocaine for mass consumption to people in the United States, and this book tells us how he did it. Sort of a lesson in how to smuggle.From his begginings as a high school football player, through his early days selling marijuana in Florida, right through to his career as the number one cocaine supplier in the US and ending up with him languishing in prison, every aspect of his life is covered here in all it's glory.With a life as rich in detail as Jung's, the book could easily have become bogged down in detail, but it's to the writers credit that he never lets the pace flag.Highly reccommended."
2,check your spelling,"If you look at the book jacket, you will notice colombia the country ,is spelled columbia. You would think they would be more careful and spell a country correctly."
5,BY GEORGE ITS GOOD,After watching the movie I had to read the book. It was really good. An actual real to life smuggler who just could not quit. If you grew up in this era it will be even a better read. This book has a lot of real characters like Escobar and Lehder but George Jung definitely is the star. Great read anh highly recommended.
3,"As my fellow colleague so eloquently put it, ""Pizzazz!""","""Blow,"" a fast and furious romp through the heydays of coke, is likely to give you nose-bleed. But don't go running for your straw just yet. With the 20/20 insight that hindsight provides, I would like to suggest that the author and Mr. Jung's collective noses have grown a bit since penning this non-fiction? Notwithstanding, it is still an interesting, if not warn, story. If you still want to read a story that hindsight has illuminated, not eroded, then read ""CIA: Cocaine In America,"" or ""Dark Allinace,"" especially the former, it will ""blow"" your socks off!"
4,This book will Blow you away!,"Blow's double meaning works well to describe the blown life of its protagonist and the object of his destruction. Although fairly blaséé and uninspired throughout the first third of the story, the frenetic pace of the remaining two thirds more than makes up for it. I also felt like I couldn't see the coca plantation for the coca plant. It continually begged the question that ""If one man could traffic hundreds of millions of dollars worth of coke, then how much coke truly flows into this country on an annual basis?"" If you're looking for a book that maintains its frenetic pace throughout and that addresses the much larger questions posed by ""Blow,"" then I STRONGLY recommend you order ""Operation Pseudo Miranda"" by Kenneth Bucchi. Pseudo Miranda, according to its jacket, is also being made into a movie by Universal Studios. I can't wait!!!"
5,EXCELLENT!!!!!!!!!,"This is one of the few books I have read more than once. The story is very well written and the pictures are a nice extra detail. Georg Jung is a GOD (and he is still alive too!...amazing, a living legend!)"
4,a truely great book,"This is one of few books that lets you experience the drug smuggling trade from the traffickers point of view. No media hype, no anti-drug message. Just a great story about a smart individual in a rough trade"
1,Do not use,This book is full of errors and incoherent answers (explanations do not even relate to the question asked). Not recommended at all.
2,No index,"I just wanted to warn people that the book I bought does not have an index. I went to a local bookstore, and the other books were similarly afflicted. This is a bit ridiculous for an educational book, but it seems to be consistent with the other reviews about the poor editing on this book."
2,Deceptive!,"The questions in this book are very different from and much easier than those that show up on the NBME surgery shelf exam. I did all of the question in this text and felt very comfortable with the material (having answered most correctly and quickly). Fortunately, I used pretest and surgical recall as well. Had I relied on this book alone, I would have been shell-shocked while taking the shelf. Again, the difficulty level in this book is inappropriate and provides poor preparation for the exam that counts! See also my reviews on Surgery Pretest and Surgical Recall if interested."
2,I hope the errors have been corrected...,"I do not recommend the third edition of this book. I have not read the 4th edition yet, but the 3rd edition is chock-full of grammatical, spelling, and even FACTUAL errors that make the book less uesful than others I have found. I would advise anyone to purchase the 4th edition with caution."
1,Insufferable,"Like most other reviews of the book indicates, there are way too many errors in this book: several wrong answer choice indicated as being right (e.g., it would say C is correct when clearly the explanation says that D is), run-on sentences, spelling errors (""alcoholic"" stool?), and explanations that are ambiguous and don't even address why the correct answer was correct. In one instance, the explanation just cut off in the middle of a sentence. It's almost as if the editors didn't even read it over after the first draft, or maybe they are marginally literate.What truly worries me, however, is how much these minor errors reflect the possibilities of major informational errors; THAT would be the worst part of the book by far."
2,Not a good resource during M3 clerkship.,"I can't say how these questions might compare to the surgery shelf exam, because I haven't taken it yet. I can definitely say that this book isn't good preparation, because the explanations don't make any sense. The first chapter is Trauma. I read my assigned textbook's chapter on trauma, attended my rotation's trauma lecture, and then tried my hand at this book. The questions didn't have anything to do with what I'd read in the textbook or heard in lecture. Question 1 deals with proper used of a Steimann pin for a supracondylar fracture. What??? The explanation didn't give any more info above saying that this fracture should be treated with a Steimann pin... didn't mention WHY that answer choice was correct, why the other answer choices were incorrect, or what a Steimann pin was. If you're looking for a question book that will actually teach you something, look elsewhere."
2,Try Pretest instead,"The purpose of doing questions, in my opinion, is to get better at doing questions like those on the shelfs! People say that they expose holes in your knowledge as well, but that is not always useful information because people generally study as much as they can in the time they have. This book is not good at training you to answer questions correctly because the questions were way too difficult. By difficult I mean that you couldn't use your brain to figure out the answer with the knowledge you've accumulated, you had to have known the completely random fact that they decided to write a question around. In summary- buy PRETEST, much more useful for the shelf, in fact, there were at least three questions on my shelf directly out of the book!"
2,Too many errors,"As the other reviewer said, this book has too many errors. I reviewed the 4th edition and they are still there. In addition to factual errors, there is simply sloppy editing. I would look elsewhere for review for the shelf and step 2 until they put some additional effort into this book"
4,Good stuff,I'm very glad this stuff exists. Its great to use while pregnant. Its not as powerful as the non-organic stuff though.
1,Doesn't Remove Nail Polis,"The shipper was great. Received the product promptly. However, the product is a bust. I read the instructions carefully, and was even prepared to spend more time removing the nail polish if it meant it was less toxic. But after 20 minutes of rubbing my nail with the remover and there was little to no change, I gave up. All it did was make the polish a little softer so it was slightly easier to chip off... but it did not remove the polish by any means. Try another brand."
3,VERY difficult to remove polish,"I bought this to use on my daughter and was drawn by the non-toxic factor. Unfortunately, it doesn't work well because it's hard to get a toddler to sit still long enough to work per the directions."
3,"Not the best, but no toxic smell is worth it.",You might as well wait for the nail polish to come off. That will be awhile though because the Acquarella Nail polish is better than the traditional! It stays on & looks good for a really long time. The remover worked fine if you got any on your hand. (I got the remover & polish because I didn't want my daughter exposed to anything too toxic & not painting your nails was not an option for her :-) I think they need to improve it a little bit.
2,Does not work at all,I was very disappointed in this product. I was looking for a gentle nail polish remover. There were no directions included in package contrary to product listing and the remover did not remove anything. My cotton ball/pad was still clear after scrubbing and trying to remove polish.
2,only works on water-based nail polish !,The product does not contain any of toxic ingredient(at least that I am aware of). The smell is not too bad however it only removes water based nail polish.
1,"This stuff does not work. Acquarella, please improve your formula!","This stuff does not work. I wish it would because it is really natural non-toxic product, but it does not do its job neither on conventional nail polish or acquarella nail polish . By the way I followed all the given instructions and suggestions - no success."
1,is it me? this stuff doesn't work at all!,"I have a few allergies that I recently found out about so I have been trying to buy more organic and natural products. I found this brand and when I saw the nail polish remover (with the nail polishes), I thought I'd try. Well, not only does the nail polish flake off in a couple of days but the nail polish remover, that is suppose to take off this special nail polish, doesn't make a dent. I used 1/4 of the bottle without removing a speck of the color. I had to resort to old fashion nail polish remover which took it off in one swipe. This natural/organic product is not worth buying."
3,Good If You Have a Lot of Time,I purchased this mostly to remove my daughter's polish and she just does not have the patience for it. After a great deal of soaking and rubbing I went back to the toxic stuff.
1,I want my money back,"I've tried all the ""green"" beauty products out there, and this is by far the worst...sorry, I don't have time to let my nails sit in remover for 5 minutes so that I can then go back with more remover and try to scrub the polish off. Tried it once and threw it in the garbage -- what a waste of my time and money. It's time people out there make green products that WORK and SMELL GOOD!"
1,Doesn't work at all,"I read the bad review and risked it, thinking the polish we are trying to remove would be easier as it's all natural (Piggy Paint). Nope. Didn't work at all. Soaked for a minute and it softened it, but no amount of rubbing would remove it."
1,Does Not Work,"This remover isn't helpful in taking off the nail polishes and it smells vaguely off putting. It's also feels strangely soapy and greasy at the same time.However, I love Aquarella nail polishes so what I do is remove them with soap and just peel off the rest with my finger nails or a scrubby in the shower. Some soaps are better than others for this, but I natural oil-based soap usually does the trick.Don't bother buying the remover."
1,I would give this no stars if I could,"I know it is supposed to be water based and non-toxic, but it doesn't do what it is supposed to do. Which is to remove the acquarella nail polish."
2,Doesn't work,"I wish I could say that this was worth the while, because it is supposedly safe and earth-friendly, but it does not remove nail polish!"
1,Doesn't work,"Doesn't work at all. It's sudsy like it has a soap base, but couldn't get any of the nail polish off, even scrubbing over and over."
4,Overall good remover,"I had never used nail polish and/or polish remover before simply because of the health and chemicals concerns I've read about them. Out of curiosity, I tried the Acquarella polish and remover as my first nail polish products and have been enjoying them. As other reviewers point out, it's a must to follow the instructions of the remover for it to be effective. I have also found that soaking nails in warm water for a little bit before using the remover to remove polish is very helpful. After all, the polish itself is water-based. With the added step of softening the nails and polish with water, I actually find that just a small amount of the removal on cotton ball can remove polish on 10 finger/toe nails."
5,Works great with the polish - Best customer service!,"This remover works well with the Acquarella polish and the company is just great. If you have an issue with anything they will take care of you. I have pretty much every product they make and it's all quality, non-toxic products."
5,Great for 8 year old granddaughter,Was looking for something that would please an 8-year-old granddaughter. Love this as it can be added to so gives easy ideas for future gifts.
5,Simplicity,"I have read a lot of ""spiritual. inspirational"" books over the years and none have ever come close to answering my questions as this book has. The interesting thing about the book is even though I have found it of enormous help I find I don't have words to express all that it means to me other than the usual cliches which I have grown tired of. A truly unique book."
1,a reader from london,"i stumbled onto these books a long time ago and i remember thinking too myself how unusual they were, these books appear to be a very unusual form of mysticism, but are ok if the reader takes them as a story i certainly wouldnt believe the author. the author claims to channel the spirit shebaka but in my opinion shebaka is really a figment of this authors imagination sort of like an imaginary friend that children have. the author deals with a chapter entitled schizophrenia in one of the books and defines it as a split personality,which is in fact a very uneducated definition of the disease i myself am a clinical psychologist and can say that mr mcmahon hasnt got a clue about what he is talking about in that chapter and he certainly has no understanding of mental illness. all in all i would have to say that these books are the product of a very eccentric mind and i didnt enjoy them at all."
1,a reader from the uk,"having read these weird books i would have to say that the author is obviously on a bad acid trip or schizophrenic, certainly not sane. the author of these books in my opinion is like a cult figure the next heavens gate, he believes things like that fleas and hippopotamuses have souls and that they some how fit in with the scheme of things on earth, then to make things weirder he believes that souls can live on other planets, personally i found these books bizarre and im sure any normal person would agree with me after having a read of them that the author is a headcase, obviously a headcase looking to make some $ out of the publics gullability."
5,No more fumbling with paper rolls,"I used to set up a paper roll, background stand, and umbrellas. Now I use this with theCowboyStudio 24"" Photo Soft Box Light Tent Shooting Cube Open Top - 4 Chroma Key Backdrops. Setup time is much quicker for the same clean results (see the photos I uploaded).I store it underneath one of my sofas in the box it came in. It looks like it can get dirty easily and if I was to do it again, I probably would have purchased the translucent one."
3,middle of the road,"The Missouri Review comes out three times a year. It's a literary magazine. I thought it might be tough to review, but really, it's not. It's not a great magazine (The Texas Review and The Hudson Review fill the same niche and are better), but it isn't the worst either (Boston Review, that's pretty bad, but it isn't quite in the same category). The fiction contained inside is pretty middle of the road--though they have published some great writers in the past, it's just the last couple of years... I've found the poetry to be atrocious most of the time. Their essays are what is pretty good. They have an intereview each issue, that goes up and down. Just depends on who is getting interviewed. There are just so many other magazines out there that fill the same niche and are better, I'd go with them. But the Missouri Review isn't that bad. I suppose it is worth surbscribing to at least once."
4,Precise Dovetails,"I have taken several of Lonnie's workshops and his dovetail DVD is as precise and methodical as his teaching in the workshops. I have been doing dovetails for many years and have read much on this joinery as well as having had personal instruction from Frank Klausz. I would consider this DVD to be a very excellent instructional tool! I recognize that you can't cover everything, but I hope that Lonnie would conside coming out with a DVD on dovetail variations (sliding, half-lap, etc). I echo one of the other reviewer in that I would like to have seen some time on troubleshooting problems with making and fitting the joints."
2,Think before purchasing,"The drive belt keeps coming off...the plastic cover for the belt got destroyed the first season-the assembly of the mower was not easy. I had to fabricate a fuel filter to keep the gas tank from clogging...as already stated a very poor overall design...if someone gives one to you, take it...just dont spend any money on one."
2,not a good buy,Hard to assemble. No real directions. The plastic cowling is now broken that covers the gears and belt it was not put togeather correctly and had to be adjusted. the trash shield broke the first time it ran. if you run the unit on high to trim the cord gives way like butter but if you use the lower speed it lasts some longer.you have to be strong to hold it up for whatever it is doing especially vertical trimming. The advertised easy to install new Swisher line is quite hard to set in place as it is so stiff it dosen't want to go there and the loop is lose. you have to wear the goggles and overalls when using the machine as the blow by can really bite.it is very dangerous if you let it go to the ground. Wheels are so big that the machiene changes angles and you get more bite than you thought - BE CAREFUL.Oh - it is very easy to start!
1,Poor support,"Don't try getting repair parts from Swisher. You can't get most of them. They don't sell through other distributors so you can't get them from there either. The cheezy little staples that hold the line on mine broke. After welding them a few times, I tried to buy a new disk. Nope. Can't. It's a simple device. Motor, belt, disk and a couple wheels. Works OK for what it is, discounting the cheap B&S; engine that's designed to last one season and be unrepairable at any reasonable cost.I got it to do heavy brush around a fence line. Works for that. It isn't a mower. No easy height control. Too heavy and unwieldy for general whacking. Lines break frequently at the staples rather than wearing out. Bad design. Pick something else or glue some wheels on your week whacker."
1,swisher,I used it once and determined that is was too big and cumbersome for me and I had it in my garage for years until I sold it a garage sale for a lot less than what I paid for it.
4,Swisher ST65022DXQ TRIM MAX Trimmer Mower,Was very satisfied with the quick arrival of the trimmer mower. Still learining about the machine but have put it to a tough test with excellent results to date.
5,"Yes, it will chop just about anything.....","I have used this trimmer for the past three months to control the weeds around small trees. It will cut through just about anything (including trees!) without bogging down. The line will last quite a while as long as you are chopping weeds and not rocks, barbed wire, or anything metal. Overall a very good product. I have not ever used the tilt head. The only drawbacks are the flimsy wheels (replace with metal rimmed wheels) and the tendency to get too close to something important! The brace holding the guard did break off but a quick weld fixed the problem. My machine has been run for about 120 hours with no problems under some severe conditions (heat, dust, large amounts of vegetation, etc). I would purchase this item again but I may look at the Trail Cutter for my application in the future."
2,Needs heavy duty protection,"I bought one of these to help with the weeds on the 10 acres I have. The cheap plastic guard broke first day. Found out that you have to wear heavy duty clothing to keep from getting destroyed by debris. I have hired two people to use this machine, and neither will. I salvaged a Dish TV satellite dish and formed a new guard of my own, but it is insufficient. I am currently looking for some way to fortify the protection on this beast.Oh, and the trim line sucks."
3,Swisher ST65022DXQ TRIM MAX Trimmer Mower,"I bought this mower because I had a riding mower by the same company and was satisfied. I have used this mower for around an accumulated eight hours.On the plus side, the mower has a fairly simple design and is easy to use. The engine has plenty of power to mow weeds and can generally be run at a low rpm. At a low rpm, the line seems to last longer than a smaller trimmer mower I have owned.On the minus side, the U bolt assembly used to adjust the tilting was broken on arival. Also while assembling the mower, I found an axel plate was placed on the mower backwards at the factory so I had to correct that during assembly, The grass guard is made of plastic and is roughly half deteriorated from objects striking its surface. It has thrown its drive belt once."
3,Profoundly Disappointing,"Readers expecting to find the humorous, satirical writing of Joe Bob Briggs are in for a bitter letdown. ""Profoundly Disturbing"" is a very serious book about movies that broke boundaries and shocked audiences in their day. The movies are well-chosen for neophyte shock seekers, but most people who would be attracted by the Joe Bob by-line will consider these fairly familiar. This could easily be a textbook for a film class, with all the good and bad that that implies. This isn't really Joe Bob Briggs at all, it's John Bloom (Joe Bob's creator/alter ego, writing a book that tries very hard to be scholarly, and engages in the kind of sociopolitical analysis that Joe Bob sneered at. It's not a bad book on the subject if you just want to skim the topic, but Joe Bob's fans will miss their hero and his three B's."
5,No Drive in Totals? Now THAT'S Disturbing!!,"That's right, in this book, Mr. Briggs dispenses with the ""9 breasts, 10 dead bodies"" reviews, and pens literate, thought provoking essays about fifteen films that shocked film audiences and helped change film history. Whether it's the legitimization of porn (DEEP THROAT) or the beginning of explicit gore (BLOOD FEAST) all fifteen of these movies hold places in film history that are just as important as BIRTH OF A NATION or CITIZEN KANE. The essays are all well written, thoughtful, and informative. Once in a while, the trademark Joe Bob humor kicks in. I'd like to thank Mr. Briggs for writing a book that shows that the movies that I've been watching and loving for years have had a great significance to the world of cinema and are more than just trash. All I can say is, BRING ON THE SEQUEL!!"
1,Profoundly Tedious,"Joe Bob Briggs becomes what he rails against - a bore! Too many goldurn words in very teeny tiny print that drone on and on about the significance of this and the importance of that. Thank God I was given the book and didn't have to buy it. Joe Bob knows better than anyone the curse of overanalyzing the obvious -shame on him for being such a hypocrite. The worst offense committed by Mr. Briggs, is that after getting into his essays and being so turned off by his tedious workovers, I am also uninterested in watching the movies themselves. In his weird, condescending way Joe Bob assumes that exploitation movies need literary validation. Avoid this book, and watch the flicks - if you are into that sort of thing. I too am profoundly disappointed in this effort. Joe Bob Briggs, beloved Drive-In Reviewer of Grapevine, Texas - should hang up the speaker and limp off to teach a film appreciation course to people who would rather intellectualize a movie than see one or make one."
3,"Actually the best of the series, but doesn't say much","This one is actually quite funny in the series, although the message is somewhat cliched.Panda is given a new toy and wants to play with it. He learns to use it, slowly, all the while friend Gander wants to have a turn. Panda always justs want one more turn and try it in a different way. Finally Panda breaks the toy, he fixes it but still wants to have another go just in case it doesn't work anymore.Gander gets sick of waitning and goes to play on another toy which Panda suddenly wants to play with as well. Recognise the story? The story of any parent's life! It is a bit cliched, but then it is actually quite funny in some ways. I wouldn't really recommend this series as a matter of course, there are much better books around."
4,Good resource,It does not give too much details about specific problems of singers but it is a very good resource for experienced voice teachers
2,Good book for highly seasoned tutors,"This book addresses some, but not all common garden variety questions teachers have about everyday issues with technique. Moreover, Miller's answers are highly technical and clearly directed at seasoned tutors in an elitist manner. For the ordinary mortal, you will need to have Google or a music thesaurus at hand at all times so you can research the numerous references to biological processes and parts of the anatomy which, after some chapters, makes for very tedious reading indeed. Miller has not written this book for the every man and most of the information is either irrelevant or too highbrow to comprehend. I imagine that the purists would love the information in the book but for the rest of us we are better off looking for resources that are more easily understood and that can be put to practical use immediately."
5,It gets under your skin,"At the first listening,I thought it was a moody and sad music.But now I realised that between 8 Mina's CD's in my collection this is the one I am always returning too.The album was recorded in 1973.and I can't say its the best she ever did,because I should have listen all of her work in that case.But this album has its own dark beauty,almost baroque arrangements that suits this ballad-collection perfectly.Every song on the album its a ballad sung by that special Mina's style,voice full of yearning,bitterness,dissapointment and hurt.I would choose Jobim gentle Bosa Nova song ""La Pioggia Di Marzo"" (Aquas de Marco) as potential stand-out but there are others beautiful songs here as well,so maybe everybody would find his own favourite."
4,Solid Journal For the Military Professional,"ARMY provides a great forum for professional discussion about military life in green. Former general officers write many of the opinion articles, while young officers in the field provide most of the current techniques and procedures for the conducting the art of war. The Association of the United States Army (AUSA) sponsors this periodical and annually hosts a conference that presents many of the issues relevant to those in the service. This magazine does not have a lot of depth in its journalist pool, but it does do a good job of seeking input from the officer corps on defense related issues of importance. If currently in the Army or retired, I recommend ARMY to stay in touch with today's relevant military topics."
4,Unique blend of classical and electronic,"I really enjoyed this album, and it is a great blending of classical music with electronic influences. It's similar in ways to the Tron Legacy Soundtrack from Daft Punk, adding the driving power of electronic beats to the force of string instruments."
1,Not a good buy,"I regret buying this book, the line length does not fit the Kindle screen and while there is an index there is no active table of contents. If you are intrested, as I am, in having a copy of this I would strongly advise trying a sample first."
5,Lots of Fun Projects Here!,"This is typical Diana Thompson, with a twist. Yes, there is compound cutting - but she also takes us through simple but elegant box making, inlay, and relief cutting. These boxes come out really great, and the patterns and instructions are clear and complete. If there is one complaint, it is that Diana must have access to a really good lumber supplier, because many of her wood choices are not available at all at ordinary wood providers. The designs come out well with just Home Depot-type woods, though, so it shouldn't discourage anyone. I love this book."
3,He got a lot better than this,"Even though the recording sounds old, there would be no trouble in recognizing Sutton as a ""revivalist"" here. Why? So many elements: groove, attack...a certain literalness in the phrasing which evokes the player piano. An absence of anything crazy or quirky - all of the stride greats had this. Such a heavy first beat in the left hand, which is so much more Barrelhouse than Stride. The greats did use this, but only occasionally, for emphasis. Sutton sounds like he never thought about playing for dancers from the Georgia or Carolina Coast - that background is what gives James P. Johnson his special lift. But the Post-War listener to Pre-War Jazz generally is not so involved with this music's more Afro-American elements; they're usually happy enough if there's no traces of Bop or Beyond. More's the pity...But, hey, at least Sutton figured it out, to a large extent; his later playing is a lot groovier! Thus, this issue is really for completists only."
2,Disappointed - What happened ?,"I have to start by saying that I immensly enjoyed Hawley's two previous albums, Late Night Final, and particularly, Lowedges. Cole's Corner simply does not match up to them. Hawley has always had a wonderfully soulful, somewhat Scott Walker-ish quality to his music. On this disc, unfortunately, all of that is gone, and he has careened off track and made a country album. Not a bad thing, I suppose, if you are a country music fan, which I decidedly am not. All the songs on this disc strike me as left over country music B-sides. As one other reviewer put it , the songs are under-written and over-produced.Please, Mr. Hawley, take off the cowboy boots and back slowly away from the pedal steel guitar....Lowedges is a markedly superior effort to this."
2,Anodyne,"I bought this on the basis of other reviews (and because I've just moved to Sheffield and love the place) and was very disappointed. If you like classic crooners, fine, but he's no Scott Walker; the lyrics are nothing special, and overall I found it very anodyne. Good background music, won't frighten the horses, but nothing more."
2,If you like Country& Western.......,After hearing Richard Hawley's True Love Gutter CD i immediately purchased on Amazon. It grew on me the more i played it and i knew i just had to have more of this smooth voiced entertainer. Coles Corner is a complete contrast from the aforementioned album and sounding very country & western which is not my favourite genre in music. I have played it several times and it just doesnt grab me like the other...so into the frisbee bin it goes.
4,Performs as Advertised,"Unit did the job during the short period of power disruption caused by hurricane Jeanne. Started on first pull out of the box and any other time I have started it. It has more than enough power to handle a freezer, two refrigerators, a few lights, fan, and TV. Despite the oversized muffler, it still produces a pretty good amount of noise (thus four stars). But, it sure cost a lot less than a quieter Honda."
4,hmmm,"definitely interesting and humorous, something we can all relate to but potentially be insulted by in a non-offensive way, if that makes sense. very enjoyable easy reading."
3,Nice read.,"This is, indeed, a nice read, as we say, and many people willfind it a very pleasant book to browse through. This is a compendium of pure Andy Rooney, and if a person enjoys hearing his 60 Minutes commentaries, they will enjoy this present book.His stories are short and to the point, and he makes no pretenseof them being anything other than his personal opinion on dozensof topics, from WWII to the present, and he is usually funnyand accurate.But there is nothing new here, and the book moves along almosttoo smoothly. There is very little to catch the imagination.This book is easily put down, and it can be read anytime, anywhere with some satisfaction.It would be a wonderful gift for Rooney fans."
3,His show is better than his book,"I love Rooney. His appearance on 60 minutes+ is like a delicious dessert as the final course of a truly good meal, or wine in French dining, simply indispensable. However, may be I had too high an expectation, this book of 154 essays on 14 major topics seemed overstretched and not delightful. Perhaps I had been so used to his short, sarcastic but always to the point remarks on TV. I couldnt be absorbed into his messages without his trademark tone and look. Still a fine choice for leisure reading, but definitely not as interesting nor enlightening as what you watch on TV."
2,Andy Rooney's version of reality television.,"This book consists of numerous very short (1-2 page) essays on a wide variety of mostly mundane topics. Each essay appears to have been written in about 20 minutes -- the overall effect is like watching a slow-moving reality television show about a fairly articulate, occasionally amusing, and otherwise ordinary old man. We hear how Andy likes to organize his papers, what he does on a typical Saturday, what his dream house would look like, and so on. None of it is particularly enlightening, funny, or well written. Since the essays are all so short, this is a good book to keep in the bathroom or at the bedside. It will also appeal to people who favor Reader's Digest."
1,There are much better ways to waist time!,"I enjoy watching Andey Rooney on television, his thoughts are always insightful and funny. Much to my dismay, ""Common Nonsense"" is neither. It is truly a waist of time to read a bitter old man's opions on anything and everything that has to do with modern life. This is the first book by Andy Rooney that I have read and it has truly ruined my opinion of him, I almost feel sorry for the guy! How can a man live through a war and return home only to become a well known, if not famous figure in the U.S. media and still complain about EVERYTHING! Don't buy this book unless you enjoy being disapointed."
2,Irritatingly Repetitive,"I thought I liked Andy Rooney, I was wrong. This book is a collection of observations of Mr. Rooney, observations that have been poorly researched in some cases (Stating that police officers have a arrest quota was one of the more laughable beliefs). The book is entertaining for a few pages, then Mr. Rooney's constantly whining voice started eating at my brain and I just got sick of the whole thing. If you are a real fan of Andy's 60 Minute spots, then this would probably interest you. I, however, was nauseated by the constant bitching of a man who has more than most could ever hope to have.T"
1,Inane,"Common? Sure. Nonsense? What else can we expect from Andy Rooney?I can't believe this silly old meatball ever got anywhere in journalism, if journalism is, in fact, what he does. The only reason Rooney is still breathing is because he's surviving on the air in his head, which is as plentiful as it is noxious. Unfortunately, that leaves his head empty except for the hollow footsteps of a long gone thought, an inane one, of course.""Inane"" is the word to describe the author and this waste of a perfectly good tree."
2,Too much lopsided for my taste.,"The problem with this book is that it offers an astounding bibliography, being therefore a mandatory list to further readings, but unfortunately it is entirely teleological, as it considers neoclessic economics of the most conservative kind to represent the acme of all economic thinking."
4,good for econ dudes,"as an econ major i found this book highly informative and interesting. however, if you are not mathematically inclined you might find some of the models and graphs difficult to follow, especially the ones involving differential equations.but if you are an econ dude, this book is great. lots of insight about how commonly used theories and models came about. well written for the most part, but somewhat wordy at times."
3,Wow!,"This movie pack is definitely for adult viewing!!! If you are familiar with jackie collins books, well the movie adds the visual for sure. Joan Collins fits her role well as the bitch."
2,Good to watch if you have problems falling asleep,"I'm afraid I can't give this product a good review. The Stud was a bit better than the Bitch, which is why this product gets a 2 at all. It had a bit of story to it, and it was fun to see the seventies looks of it. Other than that, it wasn't good at all. The Bitch was even worse. I'm afraid time hasn't been good for these movies and people these days have come to expect more from a movie. I fell asleep several times during the Bitch, and it was hard to stay awake. After watching these, I saw another bad movie - but the experience of having seen these two prior made that movie seem like a brilliant masterpiece."
5,"Grandfather, the King","As a member of Mar Puatu's writer's group, I was priveleged to watch this masterful tale of the human spirit take form and flight. Mar is a gifted and exceptional storyteller, riveting his audience with a personal account of horrifying as well as heart-expanding experiences during WWII. His story centers around a Phillipino boy whose family is taken from the heights to the depths of suffering at the hands of the occupying Japanese. The magnificence of the story emerges as the reader becomes aware of how important vision, attitude and integrity are in defining experience. This is a work of the spirit and inspired me greatly. Mr. Puatu is a philosopher for our age."
5,More Than Powerful,"Grandfather, the King, is a beautiful and powerful novel. The author deals with a young boy's coming of age against the backdrop of a family dynasty and WWII, and intertwines it all skillfully and tenderly. I could not put the book down. It is a novel I will never forget. It is also an amazing history lesson about the Philippines during that time period. I couldn't recommend the book more highly."
2,Don't waste your money!,"Poorly made with cartoon crashes! Soap stars are everywhere! Some sceens are sharp, but it lacks the punch for true disaster fans..."
2,Disaster movies,Disaster 4 Film Collector's set - not particularly inspiring so far. I have watched Earthquake and Fire and have to admit that if the other two are in any way similar then I can't consider this to be an exceptional buy
4,Good quality easy assembly,"I bought this table and two matching chairs and find myself very happy with the sturdiness of them all. I don't have any children to test them with. but it exceeds my expectations, sometimes you buy an article unseen and you are not happy with the quality. I just want to say that I'm very happy so far with the quality of my table and chairs. I recommend them you won't be dissapointed."
1,Bad Science - Please don't let children watch this,"If you know anything about electrical circuits, you will find this video to be horrible. The corny music is bad enough. But the science is just so terribly wrong on many points. If I may quote from the video, ""AC current flows in both directions. DC current only flows in one direction; away from the battery. So with DC current there is no complete circuit.""This should be labled ""Science Fiction"" and ""Humor."" It should not be shown to children in hopes of advancing their education. I showed it to college physics students. They stared in stunned disblief. They rolled on the floor laughing.Please don't buy this video for your children."
1,Purchased by Mistake,"I have not viewed the video ""Let's Get Harry"", because I inadvertently purchased it thinking that I was buying a DVD. When I found out that itwas to be viewed online and that I could not be refunded for my mistake, I figured that I would just absorb the loss."
5,Let's Get Harry,"This is really a great action packed film. Even though the film was not a successful box office hit, I love Robert Duvall's character. If you have a chance, watch this film!"
2,Stupid movie,"I bought this movie because it is advertised as a movie that Mark Harmon appears in. Mark Harmon has only a few lines and does not appear much at all in the movie. The movie played fine but the ONLY reason I bought it was to see Mark Harmon. I will never watch this movie again. So, if you're a Mark Harmon fan this movie is NOT for you."
4,Let's Get Harry,"Fantastic movie with a solid plot. Actors Gary Busey, Mark Harmon and especially Robert Duvall are convincing. Duvall's character brings a certain level of atmosphere to an otherwise semi=predictable rescue tale that takes place in Central America. It is a great action story and certainly surprised that it is not on DVD yet.Bake some cookies and order a tall glass of milk, sit back and enjoy a pleasant and ample action film minus the over the top special effects and larger than reality characters often seen in today's movies. It is solid, good and at times even a bit humorous."
4,A readable textbook,"One of the better text books I have seen- it does not put me to sleep, and is informative.The book is organized by arbopathogen rather than vector. It does focus on the vectorial aspects of disease transmission and pathogen life cycle. The writing is not so clinical that non-physicians can't understand what is being discussed. All in all, this is a good book to add to a personal research library."
5,Academically great,"This is not a terribly exciting book to read, but it is a superior reference for looking up Greek mathematicians. It is apparent that the author is partial to Euclid, as his section is close to a third of the book, (see the author's version of the Elements)but being a Euclid fan myself I can forgive this easily. Even the most obscure mathematicians are covered in good detail along with what they proved, as well as how they proved it. For those interested in historical mathematics, this book is invaluable. Note: This is a two volume set. I thought it was only one and I only purchased the second. Be sure to get both."
3,1 Year Old,"I purchased my 42"" Swisher Walk Behind from Amazon, and received on July 15th 2003. I didn't find assembly to be complicated, just that I had to disassemble the handle bars and assembly the gear lever first and then reassemble the handle bars. If they came with instructions saying that, it would have helped. But I figured it out, so it worked out, just cost me a little time. I never had to make any adjustments with the belts. This mower does cut nice. I will sell mine for eight hundred fifty. So you can save some money.Joelemail lancelotnelaine@yahoo.com715-268-6356"
4,Great Value,"I purchased this item in March 2004. I have had no problems operating this mower. A note of caution: If you are not mechanically inclined and are unable to read directions, a Democrat, don't purchase this item. This mower has a belt drive system as opposed to the more expensive direct drive systems. This requires adjustments to the cables to operate properly. The 42 inch deck contains 3 blades which makes for a beautiful cut and prevents scalping. This mower turns on a dime and allows for a professional cross cutting look. I enjoy using this product and recommend it to anyone with a yard larger than 1/2 an acre. Saving more than $2,000 and only having to increase tension on a few cables is worth it. My only complaint is that it doesn't have a bag attachment."
5,Good fodder for discussion,"This is great for encouraging your children to be a little more civilized. It presents examples of correct and incorrect behavior through short stories and poems, and backs them up with quotes from the Bible and Ben Franklin's Poor Richard's Almanac in the margins. Easy to slip one in at bedtime or whenever you see a need during the day. Some are catchy and easily memorized by your child to ponder at other times."
4,Good for older kids,"Dr James Dobson recommended this and I promptly bought this. I agree that it is a fine collection of classic poems and stories which subtly hint at good manners,,,,,, however my kids are 7and 9 so I read the poems to them. But I am sure that they will love e book and its beautiful illustrations when they get older"
2,Foreword by Joe Paterno? Are You Kidding?,"I couldn't get past the foreword by Joe Paterno. Why would an author who has a serious interest in children and has a campaign with her husband to occupy the White House, ask Joe Paterno of all people to write the foreword to her child's book on manners? Joe Paterno couldn't sell anything to me and I certainly wouldn't want him associated with anythings to do with male or female children. I wouldn't want any children in family to even see his name in print or see his photograph based on the history of his and other coaches sexual child abuse misconduct at Penn State."
1,Too Complex,"I bought this book as a bedtime storybook for my 11-year-old stepson. Not only can he not follow the stories because of the out-dated language but I, as an adult, can't even follow them. I had bought this book to replace a different book with which I had the same issue. If you have the time, energy and patience to translate the wording into modern, understandable verbiage, then you may appreciate this great collection of worthwhile classics. I returned this book and will be looking for something with stories that a child can understand as I read them."
2,Elizabethan,"I have great sorrowful sympathy for parents who must use this sort of publication to instill values, etiquette,and social behaviors.These are normally learned from the parents and nanny, not stories and books, perhaps, unless the parents themselves lack these social graces...."
1,worth about $1,"SAVE YOUR MONEY!! TOO SIMPLE. YOU CAN GAIN EVERY BIT OF INFORMATION ON YOUTUBE. Pilates Ladder Barrel with Dr Godoy, in one short video shows you multiples exercises that will help you. I'm shocked at the lack of exercises listed on this dvd. The information in the video is good and well explained. But GOOD GRIEF! Save your MONEY! IT IS RARE THAT I WOULD LIST THIS KIND OF REVIEW BUT THIS DVD DESERVES IT! It's worth about $1. & I know its the Trainer Series. Still worth $1."
3,Great buy on a double duty nailer,"I have owned this nailer for 3 months and have shot about 2500 3 1/4"" nails and about 750 1 1/2"" hanger nails through it without any jamming or misses. One feature I do wish the nailer had was to stop firing when the magazine was empty. One does get used to monitoring the magazine though. Its lightweight and shoots nails into engineered lumber without any problem. I'd rate it a 10."
4,Great Nail Gun,"I am a professional buildong contractor that uses nail guns all the time. I have 2 of these guns, one with the positive placement tip and one without. The positive placement tip works great for attaching metal connectors but the single fire trigger setup ( a must for nailing conectors on ) gets old when nailing sheeting, of framing walls. I end up using my older gun that has the bump firing set up the most."
4,Happy user,Have used item briefly...having a little difficulty changing depth of the driven nail. Everything else seems to work okay. Item is well balanced and is very easy to handle...even though it looks as it would be heavy to pack around though it isn't.
1,Sorry I bought it,"One Star because BOSTITCH DOESN'T GET IT! Buying a nailer is endorsing a company and a philosophy. Oh, it's a great nailer all right. I love mine. BUT - if you intend to use it to hang metal connectors,(and let's face it, this is the big draw here) be aware that you will need to special order the nails, IF YOU CAN FIND THEM, and it will cost more than [money] for 1 box. [My local hardware store] charges [money] for 5000 nails. At more than [money] per 1 1/2in. nail, I understand why virtually every retailer does NOT stock them ... If I had it to do over, I'd buy the cheaper Porter Cable FR350 and have no problem with nails or their price. Why not the Bostitch n88ww? Well, when Bostitch builds a nailer but won't supply REASONABLY priced nails, I refuse to go back to them. They don't even offer nails at their site. Good nailers mean NOTHING if they don't take care of their customers."
5,Terrific movie,"This was a very informative and ""watchable"" movie. It stuck to the facts about an assassination attempt on Hitler. Very well done with a really good cast."
3,Fairly clumsy and pointless TV movie,"Despite some quite nice casting that avoids the biggest problem with Valkyrie (Tom Cruise is simply unconvincing as von Stauffenberg), this German version doesn't compare well. The script is surprisingly clumsy and expositional and some of the action sequences are badly executed. At times, it feels like a school play. On the whole, the budget wasn't the issue. It just feels rushed, both in preparation and execution, and the story suffers. von Stauffenberg and his co-conspirators come off as deeply incompetent and extremely naive. It's a reflection on the film that I couldn't tell if that was the director's intention. Three stars is generous."
1,Not as anticipated based on trailer,"We had just finished watching ""Valkyrie"" with Tom Cruise. Interested in learning more about this period of history, we found ""Operation Valkyrie"". We watched the trailer, and it indicated that it was a film with period film footage and interviews with historians and others from the time period. We watched the movie, which was not well-acted, waiting and waiting for the real meat of it--the historical footage and interviews. They never appeared.If the movie trailer had shown the video we actually ended up getting to watch, we would not have wasted our time. Very disappointing.Where is the historical footage and interviews promised in the trailer?"
4,Great sequel.,"To be true, my wife read and I'm starting in some days. From her impressions, this book is a great sequel to ""Mystic and Rider"", and all the characters we love are back but focusing on Kirra and her relationships to the nobles and to Don.Great reading with a lot of emotion and a great fantasy romance."
3,First Shinn book that I disappointed me.,"Warning....Spoiler...parts of the plot are revealed. Sharon Shinn is one of my favorite writers, but she hit a sour note with this second volume in this series. The sour note was the adultery storyline that dominated the book. Adultery is never romantic. Kirra's lover comes across as the most selfish man in the world and Kirra comes across with the emotional maturity of twelve year old. Things get worst when Shinn's attempt to enoble Kirra by having her heals her lover's wife from a life threatening illness and then erasing her married lover's feelings of love for Kirra from his mind. If Kirra was noble, she would not have indulged in the adulterous affair.Due to the time wasted on this boring tale of adultery, the trilogy does not develop as much as the reader would want."
1,Not Shinn's best work,I have read all of Sharon Shinn's books. This book is similar to her very early work. The plot is thin and very slow to develop. There really is no point to reading this book unless you want to read about Kira's adultery. Shinn usually weaves a better tale between good and evil. The Samaria Trilogies are more enjoyable to read.
3,"Frustrating, still good","Most of the reviews of this book are spot on - watching Kirra be an idiot just isn't any fun. You can guess the likely result of Kirra's bad judgement starting all the way back in chapter three, and sure enough, the second to the last chapter has her sobbing in a heap in the rain. You know it's coming the entire time, but you have to suffer through page after page of Kirra's idiocy.If you took out the ""Kirra is a fool"" thread, the rest of the book could have been written in about ten chapters. I may not have liked the main plotline, but I do like Sharon Shinn's writing style. I'm looking forward to reading the next book in the series, but if it's as annoying as this book then I'm going to give up on the Saga of the Twelve Houses."
3,The one problem I had with this work....,"...was the inherent sexism in it. Why, oh why, was everyone so quick to jump on Kirra's back about having the affair with the married Romar? It takes two to cheat after all. Where were the nasty words and admonishments towards the man? True the book was written largely from Kirra's POV but Shinn could have inserted something showing that Kirra's friends were not just blaming her for the affair. I was disappointed by that.Other than that it's a good book even if it isn't as well written as others in the Twelve Houses series."
4,Great character development,"I only recently found these books and was really taken in by Mystic and Rider. The Thirteenth House delves deeper into many of the characters, with Kirra front and center, of course.Possible SPOILERInitially I found her clandestine infatuation rather juvenile for such supposedly more mature adults, but I realized that this affair was quite true to Kirra's approach to life (although Romar was less plausible to me). So the love story drew me in so that by the end I was truly moved by the character's plight and resolution. I truly enjoyed the characters' development in this book, although the villians of the story seem a tad one-sided. I would like a tad less romance and more forward movement in the plot/story. Still, a very good book indeed!"
1,For Science,"This film asks a very important question - does a movie really need a plot? After pondering upon the matter for two hours, during which I was subjected to a noncohesive sequence of CGI scenes, I think I can safely conclude that, indeed, it does. Further inquiry would reveal that some presence of acting aptitude might have a distinct impact on one's viewing experience. The title is clearly a cruel pun directed at the viewer and the dialogue appears to have been written by a trained monkey using an Etch a Sketch while she was actively participating in a feces fight. I recommend that instead of watching this video game you just play one or rent a decent film. Either one."
4,Great work of cinema - highly underated - litte commercialistic though,"This is an engaging and artistic film that works on every level. It could fly over the heads of some people who don't understand the artistry and intelligence film because of the very intentional and self aware flash and spectacle that is in the film. Anyone who dismisses this film as a mindless action movie is an idiot. This is a well written, well directed work of cinema that posesses a level of artistic quality that is rare and usually completely absent in hollywood films. This film is a result of an individual's creative vision and not another banal product for the masses.Sucker Punch catches you with a jarring twist at the end that turns out to be a feint and that is part of the genius of the script writing. The film then flows into an ending tone which is great.A very entertaining, as well as a very satisfying movie.Highly recommended. Ignore the low reviews. This is a Solid 4 star movie."
5,Way better than I expected,"Wasn't expecting too much when we rented this flick. Boy, was I surprised! High speed action, well done special effects, and a story that keeps interest. Very human without being maudlin. I am recommending it to my friends. LB"
5,Bizzare,this was a weird movie. but it was good. i liked the action and the actors were great in this movie. this movie was awesome. if you have not seen this movie then i recommend that you do
4,Amazing Soundtrack,"I saw this and theaters and didn't have big expectations of this but I do have to say that I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE the soundtrack and even though this is directed towards the male audience I enjoyed it."
3,A little disappointing. Probably a rental.,"I enjoyed the director's previous works (300, Watchmen). The trailers for Sucker Punch looked interesting.Popped the Blu Ray in last night. The movie got off to an interesting start, but once it went into the fantasy world, I lost interest. By about half way through (1 hour in), I stopped watching. Not sure if I will ever finish it.I couldn't buy into the premise, and especially in the fantasy world, I couldn't care less about the heroine. Some of the action scenes were very nice (some were lame too, especially when Baby Doll first goes into the fantasy world and meets Scott Glenn's character).Now the rest of the movie could be great. I just couldn't make it that far. In hindsight, I should have rented this movie instead of buying it. Wanted to like it.I was hoping the critics were wrong on this one (pretty bad reviews on Rotten Tomatoes). In my opinion, they weren't too unfair."
1,Pathetic Attempt at Social Commentary?,"Currently at 28:10 mark and *yawn*. So far:*Mindless fan service sans the franchise*Poor acting*Bland characters*Incoherent plot*Uninspiring soundtrack, excluding White Rabbit*Mediocre SFXThis film lacks vision - all I see are women in costumes walking around in front of a camera. I think we need to leave the pinkish violence genre to the Japanese, or Tarantino.Addendum: Ended just as I expected. How disappointing. And I'm really not clear on what Zack Snyder was trying to accomplish by marketing this film to an audience whom he then uses the movie to berate. Um, what?"
1,Almost better than being poked in the eye with a stick,"The very thin plot exists only to tie the action cutscenes together. Speaking of which, the camera work on the cutscenes was so shaky it made me nauseous to the point where I couldn't even watch. The actresses all seem to have studied at the Kristen Stewart school of acting. I only recommend this movie to people who have wronged me in some way."
1,Does Zach Snyder know what a story is?,"That was the question I had after watching the film...After the promise of 300 and the effects heavy, soulless adaptation of the Watchmen - and now this...I'm beginning to wonder if Hollywood is the one being sucker punched. Sure the effects are great, but the fact that one remains unmoved and disengaged in the process of the film is BAD NEWS. Vapid just about sums it up. Abbie Cornish is great though. Sucker Punch had the potential - but it just makes me wonder whether Mr Snyder can really make a good movie, or if he needs help in the scriptwriting department. Probably both!! Avoid this like the plague..."
2,2 hours of my life I won't get back.,"some great special effects and action scenes but these get tiring after a while. overall very depressing movie that seemed to be trying to express some overarching deeper meaning. It failed. Miserably.Really,really not worth the time or the money."
1,Just awful,"Combine extremly out of place, unexplained action sequences with the most wretchedly depressing storylines I have ever seen. I can sum it up like this. A group of young women are sexually and physically abused constantly, then imagine that they are fighting robots and all this nonsense (I am actually a fan of this genre), when in reality their situation constantly gets worse. None of the absolutely disgusting villains get whats coming to them, there is no closure or justice whatsoever. Watching this movie is like molesting a mentally challenged person, then giving them a lollypop to suck on and telling them to 'pretend it never happened' that is the same sleazy, shameful feeling you get watching this horrible movie. I was shocked at how wrong this movie was. Very sad, horrible, depressing, exploitive, wretched, miserable movie.. easily one of the worst I have EVER seen."
1,Mindnumbing,A conglomerate of music videos for the misogynist male. The characters are two dimensional with a very weak plot for the storyline. The resolution of the movie is jarring and disconjointed. The visual effects are beautiful but even that can put you to sleep like repetitive mindnumbing sex. Try doing the missionary position for an hour and a half with no forplay and you will get the same effects as this dvd.The viewer is the one who gets Sucker Punched!
1,All kinds of bad...,"Just a really poor movie. Non-sensical story used to jump between sci-fi action sequences. It made little sense, was misogynistic in nature, and just boring. It's like a 1970s ""women in prison"" movie without nudity. Even adding nudity would not have saved this clunker.What I wonder is who's spending millions to make junk like this? Why not just donate 1/100th of the film budget to me. I could write a better script."
1,Disgusting,"I'm a huge fantasy movie fan, and love comic-book style movies, so this was RIGHT up my alley. Or, at least it would have been if it were not so repulsive. I simply couldn't appreciate the gorgeous graphics and amazing acting behind the sick and twisted way that women were treated in this movie. All I can say is thank heavens I rented it, and did not purchase it based on the genre hype. I would hate to throw away something I'd just bought! That said, however, if I had bought it, it would have gone straight into the trash regardless. The victimization of this poor girl (and the others) was just too horrible for me to bear, in spite of her fighting it. I would have LOVED this movie based on the graphics, acting, and ""fight scenes"" if the subject matter they chose didn't turn my stomach."
1,Extended Cut? Is that a threat?,"I made the mistake of watching this film recently on a date. To be honest I am surprised the girl is still talking to me after this horrible film.I am a fan of Zack Snyder's former works; That being said, It was so painful to watch that I started disliking movies of his that I thought I had enjoyed.One thing that many people have managed to somehow skip in their reviews is the fact that the soundtrack is essentially a snuff film version of classic songs retooled to make the original artists turn in their graves. Poor Freddie Mercury and John Lennon, I am so sorry that they did this to your memories.Zack, I really think it is time to switch careers. I hear the gas station around the street is hiring. Maybe you can go back to school part time and actually re-learn how to make films."
1,this movie sucks,this movie is the stupidest movie i have ever watched in my entire life it doesnt make any sence and it is wack thats all i can say
1,Depressing & Disappointing,"A young girl's sister is murdered by her pedophile stepfather after her mother dies. Then she gets framed for her sister's murder and is locked up in an insane asylum where she's given an illegal lobotomy to keep her quiet. If you think this is ""fun"" and ""entertaining"" then I feel sorry for you."
1,"Go to a ten movie cinaplex, and spend 10 minutes in each theater.","My wife got this. I saw it and thought the cover looked interesting. The cover was far more interesting than the movie.Imagine going to a ten theater Cineaplex, and spending the evening watching the first 10 minutes of each movie.I got about to the third or forth plot change and just gave up. It is like a movie where the producers keep demanding a complete script re-write and then they piece all the unrelated previously shot film together to make a movie, simply because they spent money on it. The segments themselves were dark and sadistic without any real reason for it, since none of the segments were carried through as is done in a traditional movie story-line."
1,This is the worst film ever made,This is the worst film ever made. The movie with carrot top is better then this film. It's terrible. People who like this film have no taste. Go and buy Inception and Shutter Island instead of this stinker. They are about the same price combined as this film and you will thank me later. This film is garbage.
1,Beautiful Garbage,"I knew little about this movie other than it was from Zack Snyder and I liked his other films like 300, Watchmen and Dawn of the Dead remake.Not sure what anyone was thinking when this movie was put together. And I love Grade B movies, usually even the bad ones are worth laughing at. Not this one.It looks nice, especially on Blu Ray. The CGI is pretty. But what about THE PLOT???Don't waste your time with this. Take a walk or a nap or go have a drink and figure out something else to watch. And if you are one of the creative wizards in Hollywood who helped get this film made and are reading this review, you suck. And you are responsible for how bad movies have become in the past few years.BLECHHHHHH!!!"
4,I'm Buying!,"I haven't seen the movie yet. I've only seen the trailer and it blew me away! I've seen other Zack Snyder movies and I believe he'd have some sort of reason to make this one. THAT reason, no matter how weak, is enough for me. I'll be enjoying my @$$ off watching this on Blu-ray and a 63"" Plasma HDTV. I'm a SUCKER for this kind of movie. There, I said it.;-)"
1,.........puts the suck in sucker,"just horrible. not worth it. basically watching a drugged up high girl, day dreaming. It was painful to watch. my only favorite part is the music you hear in the first fight scene."
4,zack snydervis a god in tue cinema world,"Great story telling... Great visuals... Dragons. Steampunk, awesome soundtrack, what more can you ask for!? Snyder had won me over with his first film (dawn of the dead remake ) and every film since. Cannot wait for man of steel."
2,TERRIBLE!,"The only reason it gets 2 stars is for the special effects. What a dark and terrible story, extreme DOWNER!"
2,SFX ROCKED...BUT !!!,"I came out of this movie feeling dirty. Girls getting used & murdered. It was not advertised like that. Girl empowerment, uh no! Girls getting used, and ended with no sense of justice, just sadness. Seem as if Zack Synder's mind was on overload when he wrote this. SFX were great, Zack should have made a dumb live action ""Sailor-Moon"" but he made a mess... See at your own risk !!!"
5,great picture and soundtrack,Nice visual effect and superb sountrack. The sroty is vague which you have to interpret the ending yourself. I like the movies that get me thinking after see them.
2,I don't like it but someone might,"I didn't get a whole lot out of it. The way the story line cuts off into no-existant action scences was weird for me and the whole thing was very dramatic and fantasy based.Others might like it though. The animation is very good and the fight scences are pretty impressive. There's definitely more action than story line so if that's a plus for you, you might like it. I thought it was too much flare and not enough movie though. There is a plot line but it's weird and dramatic and there are random jumps into make believe battles, which I thought threw off the momentum of the story. Recomend it only if you're in the mood for lots of action and are okay with the over-dramatizations.One last thing. There's this big thing about the main character dancing but you never see her dance... That's pretty weird right? Lot's of random stuff that doesn't make any sense."
3,Sometimes boring,"Pros:Beautiful,stylized imagery throughout the filmPlenty of actionSad and tragic story but effective nonthelessCons:Extra scenes hurt the pacing moreCan be all over the place at times story wiseThe made up world felt too tacked onSummary:Its an ok movie, just wouldnt recommend watching unless you were bored stuck at home and this came on tv."
2,Not My Cup Of Tea,I did not really care for this movie and would suggest doing a lot of research prior to purchase. I did not care for the way women were treated in this movie.
3,Sucks,I've started to see the film but stop it because I didn't really understand what was really the film talking about.
4,Bluray is awesome,"This movie is just eye candy on Bluray. Its super clear and the action scenes are just awesome. The story is okay, and the acting is just par. None of the characters really stood out. But just watch for the action scenes. Each one is about 5-10 mins."
3,One time watch,"While this is a dark, graphic movie, filled with scantily clad young women in peril, it turned out to be anti-climatic, as the story line played out. I good one time watch."
3,Lacking,"Disappointed with the movie overall. Was excited when I fist saw the previews, and the previews were much better than the actual movie itself. Felt that it repeated itself throughout, no real originality from scene to scene."
3,SUCKER PUNCH (Two-Disc Extended Edition) [Blu-Ray],"I saw this in the Theaters and yes visually it rocked, But story wise I felt it was missing something. I waited for prices to drop before purchaseing this. Got it for under 12 bucks at COSTCO. That was still too much money. Yes it still visually rocked. But the extra 17 mins or so didn't really add any depth and the animated shorts were a total let down. Not Zac Snyders best work. It needed more depth."
2,A mixed bag at best,"I was surprisingly somewhat disappointed with this as I love Synder's other films but ""Sucker Punch"" suffers from style over substance throughout. While the effects are great & the film itself is very picturesque & beautiful, it nevertheless feels like your watching a two hour music video or a video game. I thought I was watching the Animatrix after about thirty minutes into the movie. While its purposefully over the top with it's mash up of genres it still seems to lack that special something that 300 & Watchmen had. Oh well, can't win 'em all."
2,Didn't do it for me,"This is a really weird movie. Half the time you have no idea what is going on and even when it is over there is some open interpretation. I don't mind movies like that, but this movie was just so weird and it was not my cup of tea. I think this movie is for a select crowed. The artistic stuff and action scenes were pretty cool, but the story so so. I would rent this first before buying if I was you."
5,nice angel,"to the packaging of this parcel, I'm sure I've got a mint, collectible item to my movie collection. I had got the bad packaging of artbooks before by Amazon. But they solved the problem asap & I can have the great item again. I'll keep to order my favorite items from Amazon in future. Support it always."
5,Steampunk meets Kill Bill.....Sweet!!,"I love the strange, unexpected and visually appealing. This movie hit it all. As a woman I would love to kick butt in a sexy outfit, but unfortunately those days are gone for most of us past 38.5, so I get to live vicariously through movies like this one. Pretty friggen awesome!! I plan on buying and putting it right between my copy of Donnie Darko and Alice in Wonderland.....................I know, lame review but I decided not to counter the self-proclaimed cinephiles' in-depth, super critical reviews. They obviously don't have the same taste as I do so they probably were disappointed. I certainly wasn't!"
5,perfect film to reintroduce imagination,"this film on blu ray really helps develop the creative feel of the character's imagination evolving into something extraordinary for the human eye. The storyline is not too difficult to follow and although it is not a happy tale, survival is the focus here and it is interesting how the characters push to survive in the tragic lives they live."
5,"Great movie, the lead character is really hot, and the film LOOKS incredible on BluRay","I won't sit here and pretend like I am IMDB. I suppose that you could go read a review of this film there. I'm no Roger Ebert (thank god). But yeah, she's hot and the movie looks great."
3,It's a good Movie,"I got this movie for a good price, i recommend if you like movies like Kill Bill or anything with crazy action lol"
1,Not worth stealing.,"I can sit through most movies just for the sake of watching something new. This one had me nodding off in record time, and altogether dismissing it before I was halfway through. This movie won't be what you expect, regardless of what you're looking for. Visually striking and very pretty, but the action was just not believable and the acting was horrible. I can't imagine who would rate this tripe five stars. I'll give them one star for the creative font on the movie title.The main character should've hit the gym, special effects can only do so much. I can believe most things for the sake of immersion and entertainment, but her struggling to get off the ground (uninjured) kinda ruins the flying through the air and dodging bullets parts."
2,One of the worst movies I've seen,"I bought this movie thinking it was going to be a kick ass action movie with hot girls, well at least they got the last part right. It almost seems like they either had two writers write completely different stories and then piece them together or they wanted to add ""depth"" to a movie that was a TnA action movie. Honestly with movies like this, or what it should have been, I don't want to ""think"" that hard, if I want that I'll watch Inception or Pans Lanbrynth. It's like she's crazy and imagines herself as a berlesque dancer but that imaginary world is so messed up she imagines herself in another imaginary world fighting things.....what??! Other than the girls(especially Jamie Chung and Vanessa Hudgens) being hot and maybe 2 good imaginary fight scenes, I would'nt recommend this to anyone."
2,Is this the future of movies?,"I have not seen such an incoherent pile of dog puddle in years. As near as I could tell the only thing that holds this movie together is the laws of physics that makes it possible to create the DVD disc. Somewhere Roger Corman must be laughing his head off. Not only did the makers off this movie produce a razor thin plotline of a movie, but they bilked the financiers and the public while doing it on a grander scale than Corman ever dreamed. Cheap plot held together with a few decent action scenes, but the only worthwhile stuff are those action scenes. You could fast forward through the rest of the movie and come away with as much enlightenment of what the movie was about as I did watching the whole damn thing. Those action scenes are the only thing that saves this movie from the 1 star rating."
1,Sucker punch,"The only reason I gave it 1 star is because there wasn't a 0 star. May well be the most stupid movie made in the last 20 years. Don't waste your money. Even if it's given to you, you are waisting hours of your life you will never get back! Go to the dentist and have a root canal, it will be less painful."
1,"Yeah, I was suckerpunched...","I am not going to try and fluff this with words that only critics understand, so here it goes. It sucked. A horrible mish-mash of dream montages aimlessly fill the screen. The ""stop and pose before I react"" thing is getting old, as is slow motion nearly every 5 minutes. The movie made no sense at all. Scott Glenn needs to be donkey punched, as he cannot act to save his life. (well none of them for that matter) Save your 3.99 and rent something else, anything else.Glad I didn't see this in the theater, I would have been financially scarred for life. Good luck."
1,Garbage,"This movie suck, sucked,sucked. The cinematography was lousy. Dialogue hollow. Generic special effects. The story is unoriginal. A girls life sucks, get worse, then hits rock bottom, then ends. Yippee. Not."
1,Ugh what a trashy movie,It was stupid and boring to boot. I skipped through huge chunks of it. I did kind of like the ending. Wouldn't watch again and won't recommend.
3,SUCKER PUNCH = DANCER IN THE DARK,"The main inspiration for SUCKER PUNCH seems to be a little cult film namedDancer in the Dark (New Line Platinum Series)starring Bjork. Indeed, a few of Bjork's songs are sprinkled into SUCKER PUNCH. Think of Zack Snyder's latest as a high fantasy, computer-generated, girl power version of DANCER IN THE DARK. Even SUCKER PUNCH'S ending scenes are similar to that movie.Like Dancer in the Dark, the main character of SUCKER PUNCH escapes into a fantasy in order to cope with her situation. The movie is highly episodic. The main character Babydoll doesn't stay in her fantasy continuously, like the trailers make you believe. Instead, she comes in and out. And when she's out, the movie is kind of a teeny, tiny, tad boring."
1,Sucker punch to your wallet,"I have now seen 3 movies by Zack Snyder; Watchmen, 300, and Sucker Punch. And all of them suck. Each of them featured a great idea, an original idea never turned into a movie before, and all were overly surreal movies that lacked empathy, relied too much on stylized action, and superhuman feats of strength. The only thing original about this one was the use of five women as the key characters; three blondes and two Asians. The casting really did not matter here, the script was just bad. The dialog was boring, and the movie reminded me of previous all-chic action flicks like Charlie's Angels. All in all, a waste of time and money."
1,perfectly awful,"this is easily one of the worst movies ever made. the person who compared it to watching a sibling play a video game for an hour is accurate except i would add that its like watching an unusually boring video game. I saw this in the theater and it felt like an extra long trip to the dentist, except more uncomfortable. Maybe like having a dental procedure while getting a colonoscopy at the same time? It felt like it went on for about 6 hours and was incredibly boring and stupid. The only good thing about this movie was the sense of relief i felt when it ended. If i had not been there with a group of people, i would have left after the first half hour. I dont understand how so many people could watch the same movie i did and give it 4 or 5 stars."
2,The Sucker Punch is for the Viewers,The movie ending is disappointing. Just like the ending of the Matrix. 3-1/2 of the 5 heroines end up dead. It must be too hard to make a movie with a happy ending. Or maybe they have to keep us guessing. Anyway the worst part is that they are trusting this director with the 2012 Superman movie. I guess I will need to keep my expectations low. This movie is for suckers.
1,I love this movie and was one of the 6 people that saw it in the theater,"I saw Sucker Punch on opening night in the theaters. As well, I bought the DVD yesterday. However, I feel very much like a second class citizen since the extended cut of the film was only available on BluRay!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! That's complete (R@P. I could complain extensively about this but, obviously, those responsible DON'T CARE WHAT I THINK. Which is what has created this prejudice manifesting in real-world terms of the product disparity. I was even going to buy the BluRay combo pack just to get the extended cut of the film until I read on the back of the box that the extended cut in the combo pack was only on the BluRay disc. Like I said, complete (R@P. Yes, I gave this a 1 star rating as an editorial comment on Warner Bros. In an earnest review, I give the movie five stars."
3,"Visually stunning, loose plot.","This was my first Zach Snyder film. The visual special effects belong on the big screen. The metaphorical comparisons between the brothel, asylum, and Baby Doll's fantasy worlds just never connected, even through Sweet Pea attempted to explain it.I am very happy I didn't waste my money going to the theatre to see it. The plot was just too thin. The action sequences are visually stunning. I feel robbed that Snyder never showed us the `dance' It works for dinner and movie with friends"
4,punched out,"I had an open mind with no expectations going into the movie. The first few sequences were very good, but then it fell into a repetive trap and I thought it was a mistake. But then ""I got it"" once one of the superwomen died. After that, it all started to make (some) sense and I loved it.Great to see that the modern graphic novel adaption doesn't try to water it down for the masses. The ""dispatcher/bus driver"" is still a bit confusing but I'm waiting to buy it so I can fill in that piece of the puzzle. ;)"
2,This is what happens when 12 y.o. boys are the target market,"Seriously, who gets paid to green light dreck this awful? 2 stars because the production quality is excellent and the acting decent at a minimum [clearly, one cannot expect actresses cast based solely upon their appearance to establish new standards for thespianism...] Can't fault the direction or the CG guys: they had a manga comic book script to work with, and did a bang up job! It's just... GIGO. You can't fix stupid!"
3,Missing something!,"I was really looking forward to this movie and couldn't wait to get it. The world of sucker punch is extemely cool and the inspiring scenery was joy. However, the story was unfulfilling. I got the alternate realities, but the pay off should have been bigger. The battle scenes were predictable and I found myself fast-forwarding through two of them. If you want to see cute girls in combat, this would work for you, but i would recommend DOA: Dead or Alive (its more fun). The story in sucker punch just falls short."
3,Flawed and studio disemboweled but has moments that entertain,"The studio insisted on removing the musical sequences which took a large chunk out of the story's heart. These sequences are part of what made the film so unique and what they ended up with was just a another CGI riddled movie that will be forgotten before it's had time to be appreciated. I am so glad I was able to see the director's vision of this film in it's entirety, in a theater. I am sorry the rest of the world was robbed of that chance."
3,Entertaining enough,"This movie entertained, but struck me as very confusing. Had I not read the synopsis I would have been completely lost. The directing was great and the special effects were awesome. I do not feel as though I wasted my time or money, but I would have appreciated a little more background on some of the characters."
4,Eye Candy,"This film may not have a great story, great characters, or win any Academy Awards, but it is beautiful to watch in Blu-Ray. Environments and animated characters look stunning in 1080p. Whether or not the story is enough to support the visuals is doubtful, but this is still worth having if you have a clear picture on your HDTV."
3,Interesting BUT...,Lots of action and beautiful girls but story is kinda lacking. I did not leave the theater thinking wow great movie. It was ok and would make a decent rental.
5,Fantastic,Alice in wonderland on acid. Great piece of cinema art work. For those that didn't grasp the concept stick to conventional flicks.
3,Sucker Punch,Nice change of pace movie. Definitely not for those who do not want a cerebral challenge. Still had to shake my head and think at the very end.
4,Movie Kicked Butt!,"This movie was so awesome that after watching it twice from a redbox, I knew I just had to buy it. The videography is fantastic along with a great soundtrack."
5,You have all the weapons you need . . . Now fight!,"I purchased an HDTV and Blu-Ray player specifically so I could watch the Blu-Ray version of this movie. I loved the theatrical version on DVD, but I loved the extended cut version on Blu-Ray even more. The extended cut answers some questions I had about the theatrical version. For instance, how did the shot Baby Doll fired over her stepfather's head strike her sister? As Senor Zoidbergo explained in his excellent review, Baby Doll fired a second shot that grazed her stepfather's arm, presumably passed through her sister, and then struck a steam pipe. Baby Doll flashes back to the steam pipe being struck in her final moments of clear thought. This movie has incredible graphics and action sequences, very likable characters, and an awesome soundtrack. One of my all-time favorites."
3,What a let down,I had such big hopes for this film but I was really let sown. Dont get me wrong a few of the fantsy sequences are amazing but the rest of the film was a little boring. And the ending was totally stupid. Zach I hope the next film will be better.
3,Great Action but HUH????,"After seeing the commercials for this movie, I decided to rent it (thankfully instead of buying it). It is action packed, but is rather confusing. The scenes jump from one place to another and starts to remind me of the ending to Wizard of Oz - where Dorthy says she had a dream and everyone was in it. I never figured out what the plot of the whole story was. So I give it 3 stars = 2 for the Action and sort of excitement and 1 star for showing how strong women can take over an action movie."
1,Crapperpunch.,"I think this is quite possibly the worst movie I've seen in 5 years. The ""storyline"" rips off parts of 4 or 5 other movies (maybe more I didn't catch) and the girls walking around all bas ass comes off as a Saturday Night Live skit. Some of the battles were cool, but even then every time the girls fall from any height they have to land all dramatic like on one knee with their head bent to the ground, which is ripped from the naked Arnie parts of the Terminator movies. A movie for hipsters."
1,Just awful,"I waited and waited to see this one. Seemed to have everything. 300 style action, pretty girls, awesome cinematography...but they blew it! The girls are just catty, the fight scenes are totally unbelievable and one sided, the music is awful and makes it seem like a music video (remakes of an Iggy Po and Pixies song).I kept wanting it to just be done with. The girls have four tasks to complete and by the 2nd I just couldn't believe there were two more to suffer through. Even if you're just looking for eye candy, there is just not enough of that to entertain for an hour and a half.Boring, boring, pointless."
1,Absolutely terrible.,This film is terrible and an absolute waste of time. Watch it at your own peril. You have been warned. That is all.
1,"Stink, stank, stunk","What a stinker - no plot, way too distracting with all the special effects hurtling past your eyes, and bad acting. It's the trifecta of awfulness!!"
1,Bad movie,I really wanted to like this movie. First problem is that the movie did not sync with the ads and trailers. The second problem is that the plot is bankrupt of entertainment value. Don't get me wrong loved the effects and action sequences but they could not overcome the fatal flaws of the plot.At best this is an acquired taste.
1,One star only because its as low as Amazon allows,"This is a movie for teenage boys who live in a fantasy world of video games and porn. Great special effects, but a story line that jumps around more than a water bug.Borrow it from a ""Sucker"" who bought it, and then only if you have watched every other video in your personal library, the public library, your church library and the bargin bin at Wal-Mart.Maybe you can get a corporate training film, or a video you watched in drivers training. Avoid this movie. Unless you like that one hot chick in it. :) Then turn the sound down.I wish I could give negative stars for this waste."
2,Can you say ... boring,"What can I say, the movie was boring. The WW1 scenes were unrealistic. The story was blah. I fell asleep the first time I watched it; watched it again and still wasn't impressed. The girls were cute though."
3,Mixed feelings,"There are a lot of great things about this movie but also many bad. The ending just sucked and that pretty much blew it for me. It makes me sad this movie was awesome in parts, the twists and turns got me interested but if you've seen Skyline and thought the end was weak then is even worse :(I can't mark it too low. There is some great action and three stories in one but a max of 3 stars is all I could give it."
2,What a c***,"From all the commercials on TV I was looking forward to watching this movie, but.... it under-delivered. What a drag... I fell asleep in the middle of it."
2,Unique spin with way too much Hollywood glamour,"When I see a good movie it usually entails characters that are developed or developing, high detail in story and portrayal, and uniqueness from the mainstream archetype. This movie fulfilled the bonus points for initial interest, but lacked detail and coherency for plot. There were too many holes in the story that seemed like things were rushed and filled in with a gleaming overabundance of ""the bigger the better"" mentality.A decent movie if you're not interested in thinking at all while your eyes are fixed on the screen. There's a tremendous amount of eye-candy (not specifically speaking of the scantily covered ladies). However, a horrible movie if you need more substance to feel a longing for more or rewardedness for plopping your butt down for the duration."
1,Sucker Punched for Dummies,I rented this movie thinking I would take a chance.. Boy what was I thinking ....A big waste of 3.99 and my time .. The bonde with big false eye lashes looks like aperson from a girlie show on the strip .. story line unbelievable . How Ironic thatpeople would pay to see this in a theater ? Well enough said not even a good enoughB- movie....Sorry
1,Ugh!,This is a vile and disgusting film. Huge plot holes. Horrible treatment of women. No resolutions that are at all satisfying. I felt dirty and unclean after watching this film.
4,An under apprecieated movie,This movie is a bit strange and hard to follow but after a few times i really love it! One of my top 10 of the past few years
2,"Potentially awesome, realistically dreadful","Some any fantastic ideas are in this film. However, it takes on a profoundly predictable and overly tripe structure. So much wasted potential. The action was epic and the visual were stunning. But such lackluster storytelling was intolerable. Two hours utterly wasted."
2,Boring,Stopped watching the movie after 40 mins. I just did not see how this movie was entertaining. The Special Effects where ok but they were not convincing. Lame acting and thismovie was just flat out boring.If you want cool special effects any Matrix movie will do. If that does not tell you how out dated and lamethe effect where in the movie..
1,The pretiest WTF? movie ever,"This movie does nothing but look good. The actors phoned it in, but at least they were nice to look at. It felt like every cool visual you've seen in a dozen other movies got mashed into this one.The character development is non--existent;the plot- barely hinted at; and the pay-off- who cares? Looks GREAT, though. I'd watch it again... for free... with the sound off."
5,Smooth like honey,"I loved the inversion of the traditional formulas, the strong acting, the twisted plot, and the deliriously beautiful visual FX."
3,Good quality,"This movie was TOTALLY not what we expected. O.O it was still good, but in a totally different way. This is a serious/ sad movie, not an action/ sexy girls fun movie.. It is neat to have two disks though, so we can let people barrow the DVD and be surprised like us."
4,Entertaining,"This film does a very good job of giving you the impression of some pretty sordid behavior without getting graphic about. You get sucked into the main characters situation and the tension builds nicely throughout the film. There is meaning in the film that goes deeper then just the main plot. The action sequences are a bit outrageous, but frankly they are entertaining and well done. I would recommend it."
4,Kind of a surprise,"Not giving to much away for those of you who haven't seen this yet, this movie has 3 levels to it. First there's the reality level, what is really going on in the real world, you quickly forget about that until the end, which is most likely a good thing. Second there's the low level of fantasy, a story within a story, which the characters create in order to cope. I guess you could say this is how the characters, or at least the main character now view reality. The third level is just total fantasy, lots of action very anime like, I found that in itself to be well worth the movie. I just couldn't wait for the next action scene to kick in. There were a few areas in the film I found a bit lacking, but I guess it was required to leave somethings unknown in order for this type of movie to come together. All in all if you like action flicks, you should be pleasantly surprised. And there are a few twists to keep you guessing as to what's gonna happen next."
3,Honestly,"This movie takes far greater a beating than it should. In a market where sequels, adaptations, and remakes rule, a veritable effort at a fresh concept should be praised just for existing. Not to say that it's a great flick or anything, believe me, but it's far from being the disaster so many describe it as."
3,A Movie Shouldn't Make Me Scowl...,"Good movies captivate me, making me forget what day and time it is, what I have to do later on, and just take me away for the few hours I am sitting in front of my excellently large flat screen tv. This was not the case with Sucker Punch.My boyfriend and I were very excited to see this. Thinking that we had saved money by not going to see it in the theaters, I went out on a limb and bought this Blu-ray the day it was released. So last night we sat down and watched it... all 2+ hours of the Extended Cut.I agree with the critics. It seems like three or four different movies put together. I caught myself several times looking at the clock to see what time it was or scowling at the tv! My boyfriend, who loves a lot of movies (more movies than me!) gives a C- on his grading scale. I give it a C+, for effort, makeup and costuming, and the action scenes."
5,"This is the Blu-Ray extended, BD theatrical and DVD/Digital Copy","Just to confirm what I received. This IS the Blu-Ray extended cut with DVD and Digital copy. I was skeptical on what I was going to receive in the mail after reading some of the reviews, but I was pleasantly surprised when I opened the package and all standard formats where covered. The extended cut is on one Blu-Ray disc, theatrical is on another BD and the DVD/digital copy are on the same DVD. You will not be disappointed! It is a great movie as well, visually stunning!"
3,"Great Movie, Bad Transfer","As much as i like the movie, i hate the quality of the transfer. Running at 1080p off a Vivitek Projector on an 80 inch high contrast screen, i have to say the movie looks very grainy and not sharp enough. Comparing this with the Blu Ray of Transformers, this is just devastatingly inferior. The special features are nice and the digital copy is a great bonus though. For the price i paid for this, i dont have huge complaints, its just that i expected the sound and picture quality to be better than it turned out to be."
4,Fantastic Movie,"The movie was what I expected and more. I loved that it spoke mostly to women in the sense of being strong and to not be a damsel in distress type thing, you can be beautiful, smart, strong and wise. I was kind of hoping throughout the movie that it would actually go back to show what really happened in the ""real"" world, but it didn't :( The only thing I am disappointed with is that the extended cut will only be on blu ray, not everyone has one & I think Snyder should have also made available special edition extended cut on dvd."
2,It almost works,"It's a cross between 'Girl Interrupted' and a graphic video game, with altered layers of reality and hyper-sexed versions of the costumes from 'Chicago.' In short, it's a mess. There is an undercurrent of entertainment running through it, but it doesn't quite add up to an entertaining movie. Zach Snyder has an immense talent for creating stylized and gorgeous films; it's just a shame he put his talent to use making a movie like this. Hollywood needs to cancel his blank check and reel him in."
5,Best visuals in a movie. Ever.,"Ok forgot about script, story, characters - If you like anime, CGI cutscenes in VGs and straight out awesome fight scenes, look no further.This movie combines so many genres and then breaks them down into her dance/dream sequences.It's like a merging of The Matrix, Inception, Equilibrium, 300.Imagine a dream within an alternate reality within a bleak reality.If you remember nothing else just know that when you see the Wise Man on screen, its about to get crazy"
3,a great show for the eyes but a bit twisted for the mind,"As special and uncommon as it looks like anything else, Sucker Punch is a great action movie and a very good window on what action can be when greatly mastered. Though, the movie really needs to be seen twice to be fully appreciated because even if its visual is astonishing and oustanding, the story part is really, really twisted and quite difficult to be understood the first time. And last but not least, the extended version, except for one sequence, really helps to fix the small details that lack in the theatrical version. A masterpiece but only to be seen for its action sequences and visual effects, nothing more."
2,crap,this was the worst movie ive seen in quite a while the fight sceens are what draw you to this movie but thats all that was interesting the whole story was a mess to follow dont waste your time on it
2,A let down,"Ehh...I enjoyed the action scenes, but the rest...the story and how it played out in the asylum/brothel was retarded...how can I describe this movie........maybe an action chick flick? I still don't know...I watched the movie and was impressed by the action sequences, but that was all.....I felt disappointed in almost everything else....I will not buy this movie nor would I recommend it to anyone"
1,Stupid,"Zack Synder might be a visual genious, but his movies are getting worse and worse. The plot was so so and a lot of new faces so you cant expect the acting to be great. Zack Snyder needs to go back to the roots of 300 and do better projects with quality story telling."
1,This is Blu-Ray Only,Unlike nearly every other Blu-Ray set out there this one does not include a DVD version of the movie and if you don't have Blu-Ray you can't get the digital copy either. Also the price dropped considerably two days after I ordered it.
3,Okay movie,"The plot is average, but the main let down is; with all these babes it should have been much sexier. The outfits should have been hotter and camera shots could have shown much more. I regret purchasing it but would still say it is worth a rent."
2,Dissapointing,"Actor's performance, direction and art direction was exceptional. Story line is a bizarre attempt to combine martial arts, video gaming, and music videos that left me with a jaw agape for much of the movie. Seems to target 16 year old boys as an audience."
3,Strange movie,"The story was a bit hard to follow. It starts out with Baby Doll being comited to an insane asylum by her stepfather. From there it switches to Baby Doll, an orphan being send to a brothel, were all the girls have to dance to be chosen. She recruits several girls to escape and needs to steal 4 items. For the other girls to steal the items she distracts by dancing. To be able to get into her dancing ""zone"" she falls into a fantasy world were she and the other girls are a bad a@@ team tasked with retrieving items representing those same 4 items in the ""real"" world. The movie ends back in the asylum and the viewer trying to figure out what happened. Half the movie is ""drama"" with forgetable acting, but the visuals are great and the fight scences (the other half of the movie) entertaining."
1,Ugh - the same action scene over and over,"The movie started out interesting as they went through the first fantasy action scene. Then the second scene was just like the first fantasy sequence. After a few more predictable fantasy action scenes, we just wanted the story to end. It had a nice graphic novel look, but there really was no substantive. I think that if you're an 18 year guy raised on graphic novels and 1st person shooters, you'll love it. Maybe the rest of us are just too old to get it..."
5,holy crap!,"literally the best movie i have ever seen. my favorite movie was edward scissorhands, dont ask why cause i dont know, but this movie punched edward right in the face! it was just amazing...everything. but the one downside in my opinion was that the main story wasnt very expansive as it could have been. but thats it. everything else is perfect."
1,Just Bad,"This was just a bad movie from start to finish. I had very little idea about what was going on as the plot jumps all over the place and the acting was just as bad. Save you $$ and wait until it is on HBO, etc."
2,Makes a great trailer,"So the best part of this movie was probably the trailer. Usually I'm decently entertained by a movie but this one for some reason made me wish it was over. I can't put my finger on it, and I was a bit disappointed by the end of the movie.Great visuals, that is about all. I really wish I could say this movie was awesome, but I can't. I'll probably never watch it again, I may watch parts of it though"
1,was horrible,This was by far the worst movie i ever attempted to watch. Don't waste your money or your time. Amazon has many good titles. I suggest you choose one of those instead.
1,Aptly Named,"This movie is appropriately named, because I felt like a sucker after watching it. It was clearly made to bring in the male geek audience with its video game-like fantasy/action and scantily-clad actresses. But as a geeky girl, I was going to overlook the latter in hopes for some substance in the film. Unfortunately, there was no plot or character development and the ""dance"" that she does repeatedly before going into her fantasy world is probably the stupidest thing I've ever seen. Overall, it's a visually striking but horrid film. Only watch it if you have some time and some brain cells to kill (or if you've misplaced your hallucinogen of choice)."
2,This Movie was a Suckah Punch,"This movie had all the potential makings to be good, but alas it failed to deliver. The only significant blow was the attempt to convince its audience that it would be a great movie and with only one good blow it wimps out. The visual effects are stunning, the girls cute, the ""daydreams"" are puzzling , this was more pulp fiction that and actual cohesive movie with a plot. Good thing it was only a rental."
1,horrible movie.,"Probably the worst movie I've seen in a LONG time. What a waste of $1.The acting wasn't bad, but it seemed like they came up with some action scenes with CGI and then just put filler where a plot should be. I should have read the reviews first. Lesson learned!"
1,Horribe,"Shouldn't even be called a Movie because there was NO character development or any real plot. If you want to watch a music video/video game then you will love this movie. The writer and/or director did a lazy job!!!! I really didn't care if any of the characters lived or died. You could cut out about 90% of the ""movie"" and you wouldn't have really missed anything!!!"
1,I did not enjoy this,"My expectations were wrong. I thought I was getting a fantasy movie. Its not. The fantasy parts are not connected to each other. In that sense, it contains some fantasy mini-scenes. I've seen better story line coherence in video games. The fantasy parts are linear and last about 5 minutes each. Then its back to this weird hidden psycho-ward of no escape. Its kind of like Sin City if you imaging that movie without a plot. But then Sin City does not float between multiple realities like this does.The worst part of it all is that no time is spent to explain the relationship between fantasy and real worlds. Or why she has these fantasies. Its kind of like playing a mini-game inside of a game, in order to accomplish some task. But then there is no explanation about why the mini-game served to complete the task in the real world.I strained to watch this. I did not enjoy it."
2,Fine Print Alert,"If you don't have a Blu-Ray player, DO NOT purchase this item. I had planned to split the price with a friend and keep the DVD copy, but the extended edition is offered ONLY on Blu-Ray. The DVD and Digital Copy included are Theatrical Version only. Now I'm out 20 bucks and don't have anything to show for it, as I already own the theatrical version on DVD."
3,"Cool looking, messy story","This Blu-Ray extended edition really is the only one you should see given the added material. The addition of darker elements of the film helps fill in some holes left by the somewhat jerky and incomplete story. I don't much care for films that rely on fantasy and happenstance to ""explain"" much of the glitches in the writing. Nevertheless, this is nice eye-candy on Blu-Ray and the story is better told in this longer format. If you hated it in the theater, you'll hate it here. But if you sort of liked it or really liked it, this version is going to be a home-run for you."
3,Graphics are cool,"This movie is kinda dull. When the main girl dances, she dreams of fighting things. Those are the sceens you really look forward to watching because the graphics are cool. The only thing about these sences is that the posse of girlfriends kill everything with the greatest of ease. Because of that you kinda already know that not much will happen to the girls."
1,WORSE THAN HOWARD THE DUCK,Good thing this was cheap on Black Friday. I should have burned my money in the fireplace instead. Don't waste your money.
2,Disappointing,"The previews made this look pretty cool. There are so few action heroes that are women, that that alone made me want to see this. But the movie itself was a horrible disappointment.A common problem with some movies is that they start at 1000 miles per hour, leaving them no where to go, nothing to increase the tension. So, the plot & the intensity just flatlines through the whole movie.The stylized fight sequences which looked incredible on the previews, went on WAY too long. The sequences / settings, seemed to have no connection to the movie or to the fight scenes. They were just random scenes that I assume, someone just thought they looked coolAnd the ending...without spoiling it......was a total let down."
3,Sucker Punched with the ticket price,"While I did enjoy this movie, I enjoyed it for all the wrong reasons. The visuals and the women in it were great to look at, but there was zero substance in this movie. The plot was confusing/relatively non-existant."
2,okay to rent but not buy,"This is probably going to get lost in all the other reviews but I'll put my two cents in. First of all I'd only rent it. I would have felt ripped off if I paid full price for it. It seems to have been designed with the notion of turning it into a video game. You get the gist of the plot at the start of the movie, but no real detail. You never find out why the other girls are there except in the fantasy land dance hall or what happens in the real world of the mental institution while all the fantasy is going on. All in all, it has the feel of a comic book that was turned into a movie, but had to be cut and edited like Lord of the Rings to be able to adapt it to a movie."
1,Wow...,"This has got to be the WORST film I have seen since Twilight, I didn't think ANY movie could top that one on the c***dar but WOW. This one definitely hit the nail right on the head, such a disappointing movie, I had such high hopes for it. Other then the obviously gorgeous girls, there is nothing to be praised, i wouldn't even give this film half a star if I could."
1,Shocked,"I really had been looking forward to seeing this movie. I finally get to watch it and it easily has one of the worst plots ever!!!! Its like they took two movies and put them together to make one bad movie. Granted when babydoll has her ""dreams"" its pretty bad ass. But WTF it makes no sense for the plot. It isn't that the plot is so deep no one could understand it. It is just that the plot is so bad I don't know how many people were so generous on the reviews. Honestly if you want to see it, I do not want to sway your opinion but the movie is just painful to watch. I mean really.....still in shock of how horrible the plot was."
2,Umm Come off wondering WTF,Ok so i don't review allot of movies but i do try to watch my far share. Me and some friends where watching this movie and kind of looking at each other when it finished like what was the meaning of all that. I have to say it was to me a life is a bitch ending. I did read that the director had done 300 and watchmen so this was his artistry movie but to spend so much on over the top special effects dream sequences just didnt seem to stick enough substance in to the film to justify all taking place in her head. I have to admit as a guy in his twenty yes the women where attractive but was that a enough to drive the movie i dont think. I would say u have a hour or two to kill go ahead but dont choose this as your weekend movie night flick. Hope he does better with superman reboot hes directing next.
1,Deceptive marketing,"Note - this a review of the product, not of the the movie. Sucker Punch is an amazing movie and I have been eagerly awaiting the extended version.What the package reeds ""Blue-ray, DVD, Digital copy"" The product features list include :Extended Cut Feature FilmTheatrical Cut Feature FilmWhat they do not tell you is that the extended version is only on the Blu-ray disc. The DVD is the theatrical release only. If you do no own a Blu-ray player you can not watch the extended version."
1,Not worth the money.,I wish I hadn't purchased this movie. It really is awful. It is all fantasy and music. The story line is really bad. It reminds of that movie Moulin Rouge but the fantasy version of that story.
4,BUYER BEWARE,"One thing that someone should point out is that the picture is incorrect. This item is NOT the combo pack of Blu-ray and DVD. It is a two disc blu-ray pack. That surprised me when I received it, but I decided to keep it all the same. This has more features than the combo pack does, which was fine by me. The special edition is worth getting for all of the extras that it contains, and is probably better than the combo pack (unless you have a ton of friends who doesn't own a blu-ray player or you are currently do not have a blu-ray player, but are considering buying one).The movie doesn't have too much, if any, plot. Sure, I said it, but I still love it simply because of Snyder's visual style and music and feminist message. Almost every piece of music during the fight scenes are performed by women (and some are even covers of songs written by men). I think it is, aesthetically, a great work by Snyder. However, if you're looking for plot. Try looking elsewhere."
3,Eye Candy,I waited for this to go on sale ($4.99 on Blu ray) and than I bought it. I was not really pleased with the lack of story line or substance in the movie but the eye candy is well worth the cheap investment to add this title to your movie library. If great visuals and pretty ladies are all right for you I would say buy it.
3,Pan's Labyrinth Sequel,"Remember Pan's Labyrinth,how the little girl in that movie had wild fantasies and lived out fantastical events? It's pretty much the same idea here, although they took it a step further and put imagination into imagination. There are three levels going on here:First Level(Reality) - the girls are in an insane asylumSecond Level (Fantasy A) - the girls are trapped in a burlesque house type of dealThird Level (Fantasy B) - the girls are a team of fighters; the events in this fantasy are guided by events in Reality and Fantasy A.The movie starts off with a bang and then slows down so much it makes you wonder if you have the right movie playing........However, it picks up again and eventually provides a satisfying ending.One of the annoyances of the movie was the BLARING soundtrack during the fantasy sequences. A little less would have been better.Check out Sucker Punch."
5,sucker punch,LOVE THE MOVIE!! alot of people didnt like it but the thought and the way the cinamia flowed watched it now 15 times
3,Good Movie if your expectations are low.,"The Trailers for the film can be a bit misleading unless you read the synopsis. Visually striking yes and the soundtrack is awesome but the film is sometimes repetitive and is ultimately lacking something (at least i felt that way, dunno bout you guys). Still a good movie though, Just don't expect much."
4,merlin,It was a little hard to follow at times with flashes into fantasy sequences. The overall plot was good.It was enjoyable. You pretty much get what you expect.
2,Why?,"Apart from the graphics, not much I can say about this waste of time, sorry excuse for a movie. Even the characters appear disinterested & very distant. Though, being kidnapped & used in sex trafficking can make one so, however, I get the feeling that some of the actresses are thinking to themselves: ""why did I agree to to do this film?"" There's very little to no commitment. Maybe, you 'll see it differently when you watch it. Mine, a BD, went to the trash the same day I saw it. Didn't even bother watching the extended edition."
3,"An involving, gut wrenching dark Art movie","I actually don't normally write movie reviews. I felt like I had to with this film...It was so very interesting and had us riveted to our seats during the entire film. But... It was too dark for my tastes. I was expecting something a little different. I had lots of moments during the film where PTSD (from abuse) slipped in and made it such that I did not want to finish watching the film.Personal junk aside:The film was expertly shot, the angles and transitions were superb, and the camera motion never distracted me from the ""living in the movie"" experience I always get with films like these. I like plot twists, and this one delivered a few nice ones.This was sort of like a modern Twilight Zone episode with excellent FX, killer song covers, and convincing actors."
1,Sucker Punched Cruel & Unusual,"Sucker Punched is how I felt watching this. While the cinematography was very well done and given a real script it could have been an action fantasy in the new noire style of Sin City etc. it instead pushes a bunch of poorly stitched fantasy MTV videos together in a dismal attempt to come off vaguely philosophical or something, jury is still out on whether there was a point.I wouldn't mind seeing more from the crew who put it together as long as they get a script and troop of actors worthy of the effort... Somehow Cruel & Unusual films is a perfect name for this production company."
3,Action: Great. Story: Mediocre. Overall: Slightly lacking.,"I thought this movie was great when I first watched it, but that was only because I was hooked on the action scenes. So, allow me to delineate what my second thoughts were when I came back and watched it a second time with a clearer head, by quoting the show Community.Abed: It's the movie ""Sucker Punch"" on Blu-Ray.Pierce: That's the meaning of Christmas?Abed: No, it's a metaphor. It represents a lack of payoff."
4,"Three discs, not two","Like the heading indicates, this is actually a three disc set, not two. A Keller Incident takes place, mayham insues. Sounds like this might have been a show where it would have been substantially better in person. I mean, Halloween, Vegas, SCI, ya know, a complete freak show. It still holds well on disc though, and is enjoyable with the obvious playful nature that the band exudes. Solid, but a must have because of the time and place"
4,Better go with complete,"Like other reviewers before me, I would also recommend getting the Complete Weekend on the Rocks from the band's official website. It's pricey but worth the money. The set offered in Amazon is a summary of a great show that doesn't deserve to be shrunken and picked apart.With that said, this is still a good buy if you're a fan but not a crazed, completist DMB fan like most people who purchase DMB's live CDs. The new songs from the Stand Up CD sound so much better live. That's were DMB's energy can really be felt and appreciated."
5,Incredible - wish there was more!,"I'm a DMB obsessive, and this album was a huge addition to my collection. I've been stuck on all the old stuff and haven't really gotten into the new stuff until i bought this one. On the cd's, the highlights for me are Don't Burn the Pig, #41 (one of DMB's all time best!) and Smooth Rider. The entire DVD is brilliant, but the ones that stand out: Dreamgirl, Louisiana Bayou, Recently and Jimi Thing. If a non-DMB fan watches Recently on the DVD and is not a fan afterwards, they have serious issues. The only issue I have is that I wish there was more on the both the CD's and DVD!Buy it - you won't regret it for a second!"
4,Good but could be better,"It's a good compliation of songs that were featured at the 4 day Red Rock event this summer. I think it's a little too much with the Stand Up songs, and they should have replaced American Baby with American Baby Intro which I think is probably one of the best live songs from the Stand Up album. Although I will say it is one of the few times that I've heard Dave not sounding flat in American Baby. The highlights for me are the first live releases of Pig (aside from the full weekend at the George set), Say Goodbye and Lousiana Bayou, Time of the Season, and Halloween.I personally would have liked to have seen a full band version of Typical Situation from the weekend be included, Drive In Drive Out, Seek Up, Butterfly, Grey Street, and Hello Again. But that's why I also ordered the complete 8 disc weekend set from their website."
5,Works well for what I needed,I purchased this battery for a GE 900MHz phone model 26938GE-D. It works very well. The old battery would not hold a charge for very long anymore. The battery will hold a useful charge for several days under light use. After a month or so of use we have not experienced dropped calls due to loss of battery charge.
2,You need airforce pilot eyesight to use this!,"I played a few of the songs on guitar, and the chords seem correct but could they make the type any smaller? I don't think so! If you don't have the music right up close and with good lighting, a person (especially over 40!) can't hope to be able to enjoy using this book.I was very disappointed--great selection of songs, but no hope to be able to use the book in a party environment."
5,R & B Fake Book,"Another great Hal Leonard book! This one's got lots of great Rhythm & Blues songs, by such favorites as Diana Ross & the Supremes, Marvin Gaye, The Temptations, Otis Redding, and James Brown, to name just a few. 375 songs in all!"
3,400 pages,"It's okay, but it doesn't have guitar TABs. I read music, but not anywhere near as fast as I can read TABs, which really slows down my being able to use this book."
2,Don't be fooled by the contests,"The idea of this fakebook is terrific, but its design and structure are highly flawed. Don't waste your money on this book. All you get is the melody and the chord changes, all of which are printed so small as to be illegible on the band stand. In addition there are no bass lines or any real sense of how the tunes are supposed to unfold. If you want to see how a fake book that contains R & B should be layed out and published check out the New Real Book series put out by Sher publications. Unfortunately the R and B is scattered throughout those books and not systematically put in one cover as it is with this horrible edition by Hal Leonard. It would be incredible if Hal Leonard's people would subcontract the work to make a good fake book to someone like Sher, then we would have the comprehensiveness that Hal Leonard provides along with the very high quality and true usefulness that Sher and his arrangers bring to a project."
5,The ultimate cheat sheet!!,"What can I say. I like taking short cuts, and this book allows me to quickly get the gist of songs, and add my own flava. Also makes a great practice buddy."
4,Great Classic Country,"This is a great single-disc compilation of classic honky-tonk. I lopped the first and last tracks off, and the abbreviation makes for a perfect sampler of music perfectly suited for driving down the back roads out west with one hand on the steering wheel and a cold bottle of beer in the other."
3,"Very pretty, not very durable","This is a beautiful hip scarf--I received a lot of compliments on it-- but the beads started falling off in the first month I bought it. Every time I'd hit my hip, I'd lose a couple beads. It's good if you're just taking a belly dance class once a week or so, but if you plan to use it for a couple hours a week for 2 or 3 months, and it will fall apart."
5,The disco empress at her best,"1970s disco music still resonates with me, ringing with the joy and optimism characteristic of the style -- a joy soon stifled by the economic miseries of the mid-late '70s. Donna Summer epitomized this music. To my ear and spirit, she stands out above all others, even though Gloria Gaynor and others made some great hits. Buy this before going for any grabbag collections of disco. This is not serious listening music, nor music to critique for its rhythmic complexity. It's feel-good, get into your body and get moving music!"
5,Endless pleasure,"Endless Summer is a chronological collection of Donna's greatest hits from the middle 1970s (Love To Love You Baby) through the late 1980s (This Time I Know It's For Real). It offers the best of her dance classics like I Feel Love, MacArthur Park, Hot Stuff, Bad Girls; the best of her ballads such as Dim All The Lights and On The Radio; plus great pop songs from the decade of the 1980s when she worked with a variety of producers. My favourites amongst her post-disco work include The Wanderer, the majestic State Of Independence and This Time I Know It's For Real. This collection proves that Donna could do it all - her mastery of various styles is complete and her talent has stood the test of time. Five stars for this great album by a singer who was once the Queen of Disco but has proved herself a consummate vocalist and a true original long after the disco lights had faded."
3,Fair Collection Has Some Flaws,"Aside from a poorly done remix version of ""No More Tears,"" a few key singles are absent: ""Unconditional Love,"" ""There Goes My Baby,"" ""The Woman in Me,"" ""Who Do You Think You're Foolin',"" ""Cold Love, ""Walk Away,"" and ""I Love You."" Not that these were all as big as the hits included here, but for the price of this CD, more should be offered. Check out the more comprehensive anthology for your missing favorites."
3,A workable book,"This is a 32 page beginners guide to playing the recorder. It's comparable to most books of this sort, and will work just fine."
3,Very basic book,"Intro to recorder music, good for a young child. As an adult i was able to finish the book in 30 minutes and play the songs. Would recommend a more advanced book for any adult or someone who has a little recorder experience, for example if you played in elementary school."
1,Warning: For Soprano Recorders Only,"I own an Alto recorder, which is the principle instrument of the recorder family. This book is for students of the Soprano recorder. This creates two serious problems. First of all, the fingering for the Alto very different than for the Soprano and, secondly, the sheet music is intended for an instument with a much higher range. The product description fails to note this rather essential feature. The book is useless to me."
5,Excellent Introduction to Music and Recorders,"This book is old--but it still works. I first came across it when I was in fourth grade and we learned how to play recorders. That was in 1985. I stumbled across the book almost 30 years later and found that it holds up well. The 32 book page is excellent for children and those of us who have little background in reading music. Alfred d'Auberge and Morton Manus do an excellent job in providing simple instructions and varied if somewhat dated pieces to practice on. Keep in mind this book is for true beginners--and some more experienced readers will find it very simple. Despite this, ""It's Recorder Time"" remains an excellent introduction after all this time. Recommended."
1,All Audio Expo,"The other person who wrote stating that these are used, they are actually refurbished. Same thing. When I got mine, it looked like it came out of someone elses vehicle. It was missing the decal on the top of it and had scratches. The Dealer called me and asked me to take off my rating and he would refund 10% back to me. He also stated that it was his fault because it was labeled new, not used/refurbished. I agreed to take my rating off and he still has not refunded the 10% back to me. I gave them 1 star because of dishonesty.Cleveland,OH"
2,toxic,"I was quite happy with the product until I found out on the website Cosmetic Safety Database that Hemp with Organics is highly toxic. Wow, I guess ""organics"" is really a misleading advertisement; there's nothing organic in this product. I'll look for another product to use in the future."
3,ok would like more grip,I think this is a good product. The pros are the wrist control from the straps. I am reall not fond to the lack of grip on these particular gloves and I do not recommend major lifting with these gloves unless you plan on buying these gloves along with your daily hygien products as they will wear fast.
4,Better than most,I bought these gloves because of were I am at there is only 1 set style. I like the grip on these and the wrist wrap was a great touch to it.
1,Not the Usual Rubermaid Quality,"Very unhappy with this; Rubermaid usually delivers but not on this step stool. I've had it about a year. First, it split in the middle then, one of the caster legs broke off. It didn't roll very well anyway. A poor substitute for the old fashioned kick stool from the library."
2,Just ok not really worth the money,"Great idea, but I feel a little unsteady on this step stool. It's also rather large and is cumbersome. I find myself picking it up to move it around, which is not what I bought it for lol."
3,Hopefully will be better in time,ProsFit over seats fairly wellHopefully they will wear well enough to justify costConsExpensive for what they areMounting accessories missing from bagMounting straps too long for appropriate use
1,Don't buy it! Not even worth the 1 star rating.,"The rumbling you feel isn't an earthquake it's George & Ira rolling over in their grave. This CD is not at all what I expected. The price..... would have been better spent tossing it out the window. If I could have given less than one star I would have done so. If you cherish the Gershwin tunes, don't buy this one as you'll be greatly dissappointed."
3,Harmonica Plenty,"I prefer to listen to Gershwin played by a full orchestra. Too much harmonica! Vocals are ok, but not great."
4,"Listen and enjoy Elton, Sting et al...","My biggest surprise after reading reviews that trashed Elton John's performance of ""Someone to Watch../ Love is Here to Stay"" was actually listening to the mature Captain Fantastic's track and being very delighted and impressed by his vocal control and inspired interpretation of these songs. Bravo! And shame on those listeners who bring their prejudices about a performer's nationality, sexual orientation, etc. to negatively color their enjoyment of music. Very nice listen, the whole CD. You won't be disappointed."
4,Witty and brutaly honest view of relationships.,"In ""Brothers...,"" Mr. July candidly and with great wit presents a man's point of view on relationships. The title to some may imply a strictly African-American slant, but in his diverse essays Mr. July conveys an everyman's experiences in the dating jungle. This is a notable addition to America's unique multi-cultural oeuvre of male vs. female discourse."

4,Tool for Strengthening Aging Hands!,"I am 65 and in good shape, working out several times a week. However, lately I had noticed that my hand strength was not what it used to be. I asked my personal trainer and he suggested this product. I found it in a catalog but when I searched online found the same product for less online. I works well and I hope with using it several times a week, my finger and grip strength will improve!"
3,It's okay.,"Shock Labyrinth was an okay Japanese movie. I wouldn't call this a horror movie, it's more like a suspense movie. So if you're expecting something like The Ring or The Grudge, you're going to be disappointed."
2,Odds with this one,"The movie:Hard to understand it. Lots and lots of weird stuff going on in the story line. You have to be into this sort of drama to get into it. I guess I am not.___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________3D effects:Loads and loads of crosstalk. I have an high-end 3D TV. the crosstalk was way too much. As a matter of fact, this is one of the worst movies that I have because of the ghosting that is going on.Recommendations to my friends? Probably not.Recommendations to my enemies? Oh yeah.Will I loan this to my brother to watch? I'll give a warning, but if he wants to watch it, then who am I to deny him the fun of being disappointed.Would I loan it to my best friend? Hell yeah... pay back is a dog!"
3,Pratchett's take on MacBeth and other things,"As a major fan of Pratchett's work, I was rather disappointed by this one. Pratchett weaves a tale of murder and intrigue in the tradition of Shakespeare (MacBeth to be exact). This should be a great story; but, it mires early on and doesn't pick up until late in the novel. The last few chapters are funny and well paced; but, are too late to really save this novel. Read this if you are a Pratchett fan"
1,"Great story, bad narrating","Pratchetts work, as always, is entertaining and enthralling. The narrating, however, leaves a lot to be desired. The voice characterisation is poor at best, turning Nanny Ogg into a vague ""whingy"" old lady, and confusing the Duke and Granny (which is very confusing when they are talking to each other). The tone of the narration would be better suited for a pre-school text rather than a literary novel. One wonders why Ms Imre was even chosen in the first place, let alone employed to narrate more than one novel.Hated it so much that I'll buy the abridged versions instead of Ms Imre's in the future."
4,Not the best...,"Well, frankly I didn't like it very much. It had some great moments in it but everything was kind a slowish... altrough there are some extremly very funny moments the story is kind a weak. The crazy duke, and the controlling duckess were the only two gems in the whole story (and maybe the dwarf writer... he was kind of cool.) But maybe I just didn't like the whole withc thing (altrough Equal Rites was superb.)"
2,Boring,"This was definately not one of his best books. It was boring and the plot dragged on, the characters weren't interesting enough to care about, it took me two months too read this book because I forced myself to read it. Everything seemed to be the same, I was glad when it was over.Even though this book was a disappointment I will definately recommend many of his other books, such as Mort and Colour of Magic."
5,Granny Weatherwax Rules,"Excellent character development in this Discworld novel. Granny Weatherwax reminds me of some of my grandmother's sisters and oddly enough, Nanny Ogg reminds me of Grandma herself. Fun story, good adventure."
4,A Discworld take on the theater and the Bard,"Pratchett's Discworld books are generally satires, each skewering a different topic. This book is no exception, though it helps to be somewhat familiar with Shakespeare to appreciate the humor here. The story here includes elements that are pretty clearly lifted from Hamlet (including a regicide and a ghostly king) and Macbeth (the three witches), among others. There is even a theater under construction in Ankh-Morpork called the ""Dysk"" (i.e., the Globe). But, as usual, Pratchett takes all these well known elements and gives them a distinctly Discworld twist.While this book didn't have as many places that were laugh-out-loud funny (though the reactions of the witches to their first experience at the theater was close), the book is full of amusing situations and improbable encounters (after all, this is Discworld, where the improbable happens all the time). This was a quick read and a pleasant diversion, and would likely satisfy most fans of Discworld."
3,"Wyrd Sisters; Weird Book, but what did you expect?","First let me say that, as with all Terry Pratchett's other books that I read, I liked this one, but not as much as I liked Guards! Guards! I am sure that Wyrd Sisters had, at some level, a deeper meaning than was obvious to me. I don't view the Discworld stories as satires, although they may be, I just want some time to escape from Earth. And this book filled the bill. The main characters were well developed and the book was overall a very good read. I look forward to reading many more of his stories, although I am not calling my travel agent to book a visit to Ankh Morpork."
5,"Great Book, look into amazon.co.uk","This paperback is also avaible from amazon.co.uk, ships within 24 hours (so it might take less time to reach you even though it crosses the atlantic) and it may be cheaper after shipping.However, I would reccomend just get the mass paperback from amazon.com, unless you like nifty covers."
4,Zany Fun,"This was my second Terry Pratchett and though it did not make me a die-hard fan it put me down on his list of admirers.The zany humour in this book had me laughing out loud. From the comical metaphors to the crazy town names to the engaging little footnotes Pratchett thoughtfully put in.The characters are unusual but engaging and likeable at the same time. Anyone who can make selfish Granny Weatherwax, wishy washy Magrat and an intelligent Fool loveable has got my vote.Read this whether you love fantasy or not."
5,One of his best,"This is one of my favourite Terry Pratchetts ever!! And definitely the best of the Granny Weatherwax, Nanny Ogg and Magrat Garlick adventures. The spoofs on Macbeth are hilarious and creepy at the same time, the characters are slapstick without being superficial, and the jokes are some of the most incredible Terry's ever turned out. Absolutely marvellous!"
3,Practice novel leading up to Brilliance,"I adore Terry Pratchett, but I admit that he has learned a lot in the last 25 plus years. This book is not his best, although it includes many of the aspects that make his best books not only best compared to his own work but also compared to those of others. In this novel, there is satire not only on our own society's cynicism and blind belief, but also on the deep fairy tales that continue to move us, and the surprising forces that give us hope in our own individual free choice.This book isn't Pratchett's best, but it is a great deal better than most authors' average,and reading it will give you an entryway to some of the best fiction writing of our time, fantasy, ""realistic"" or otherwise."
3,The book's not bad but the reader needs help,"Tony Robinson really needs to stick to reading Agatha Christie or something. The book is pretty good but, unfortunately, the reading of the audiobook is quite annoying. Sometimes it's hard to make out what people are saying because, in an effort to make voices unique, they end up talking in a tone that reminds one of fingernails on a chalkboard overlaid with breaking glass. It's not a pretty sight. A lot of the humor is lost because the reader can't convey it properly.Bummer."
5,A wonderful pastiche of Macbeth.,"From what was happening in real life in Elizabethan times to the actual story of Macbeth, Pratchett does a marvellous job of parodying Shakespeare's play and, for a change, Granny Weatherwax, Nanny Ogg and Magrat are really great, very funny characters. Well worth reading."
4,"These Sisters are really ""Wired!""","I thought this was a marked improvement on Equal Rites, a much more complete introduction to Granny Weatherwax and the Ramtop Witches. Nanny Ogg is very funny, and so is Magrat Garlick, especially in her interactions with the Fool. IT is so classic just to read about the three witches when they cook up spells and always argue about the ingredients. Here we also read a lot about ghosts, in particular the dead king Verence of Lancre. Of course, there are also all those Shakespearean gibes, especially with MacBeth. That alone is worth reading this book. But there is much more, much, much more..."
3,Not one of his best.,"Story spotty and a little hard to fallow. It is a middle ground book for a very talent and funny writer. The Discworld is overall excellent, but this one let me down some. It did not flow like the other books he has done."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"In a comedy series that goes this long and has witches it was going to be pretty hard for Pratchett to resist the urge to do a Shakespeare spoof. He takes a crack here, and it is not too bad. For fans of the Death and Rincewind type of antics though you may well not enjoy this one as much.Some amusing lines, but only average, to me."
5,Among the Best of the Best,"Wyrd Sisters was the first of the Discworld series I happened to stumble upon. Pratchett, using his characteristic style of humor mixed with common sense and blatant attitudes, hooked me with the three witches, Verence the Fool, and, my favorite, Death. I would recommend it for anyone new to the Discworld series. With a plot that turns in on itself, it's sure to make for a searing read, bound to make impressions, and definitely going to leave you laughing."
5,Buy all of these now...,"...so we can create incredible demand so I don't have to pay 16.95 for some of the ones that Harper hasn't bothered to publish yet! This is one of the best -- anytime Granny (Esme to her friends -- er, I mean friend) shows up, it is bound to be entertaining. This one has everything, including flat chested women (you will recognize her sort from your local looney NuAhge store) and fools who would be kings, apparently. Buy this now. Terry Pratchet's sanity can't hold out for much longer, and even the paperback's will be worth something when he finally cracks. Highly, highly recommended."
5,Probably the best book in the Discworld series.,"In this magnificent spoof of Shakespeare's Macbeth,as well as many of his other plays, the witches GrannyWeatherwax, Nanny Ogg, and Magrat Garlick are pittedagainst a mad king who thinks that (gasp!) witches shouldpay taxes, oh, and he's also a murderer. A hilarious story,this is Pratchett at his best, but then, when is he ever bad?"
4,I love my tea..,These a great for my tea maker. I wish the plastic was a little heavier soit won't break other then that I love this and helps me with my tea fix.:)
4,Exactly what it said it would be,We use our tea maker all the time and I knew it would only be a matter of time before we needed a second pitcher. These were exactly as advertised. They fit the tea maker and have been through the dishwasher on the top rack without ill effects. We've only had them a few months but they are holding up so far. Would purchase again.
4,great tea but picture feels tad weak,Still no dishwasher eventhough it says ok. It is a great product and the maker helps with the best Ice tea made.
1,Don't buy from Small Appliance,"I bought this pair of pitchers from Small Appliance and the first one started leaking during the brewing process within the first month. I did not put it in the dishwasher, but always hand washed it. When I contacted Small Appliance (just past the 30 days since it shipped but not 30 days after arrival) to address the situation, they initially balked and told me that since I had had the item for more than 30 days and they couldn't do anything about it. They grudgingly passed it on to a manager who did finally agree to replace it, only I had to mail the item back myself... no pre paid mailing label, their company policy. I know when I have had to deal with Mr. Coffee directly in the past for a similar issue, they were much more cooperative. I plan to avoid purchasing anything from Small Appliance in the future."
3,Good by not Great!,"These pitchers are good, but you cant but them in the dish washer like the one that comes with the ice tea maker."
3,Pitcher,"Exactly what I ordered. The original pitcher cracked on the seam, causing it to leak when the tea was brewing...hopefully these will not."
3,Very bad packaging,"The canopy was so poorly packaged that parts were spread from their shipping dock to our home incalif. This was to be a X-mas gift and the first shipment was useless junk! Amazon guareenteed me they would have a replacement to me in two days (before X-mas at least I hoped). It was not shipped until mid Jan. When it was received from UPS, it also was torn open and parts were missing. Amazon doesn't seem to care about the problem as I have contacted them and they failed to answer."
4,ADVERTISING 2ND EDIT,"ADVERTISING 2nd Edit, John S. Wright, Daniel S. Warner (McGraw-Hill, New York, 1962-1966)From the era of MAD MEN?This book, hardcover, from my personal collection, is still as entertaining as when I used it for a course in 1963. The book is full of interesting vintage media hype and technology. Someday when you have a yearning for old BURMA SHAVE technology give this book a look. It's fun to review the creation and function of advertising. An example of what attracted us way back then: a State Farm Insurance advertisement slogan ""St. Louis Woman Tickled with Twisted Bumper,"" depicts a smiling matron in sensible shoes hugging her damaged car bumper. This, a good visual message for car insurance.ADVERTISING, the book, is a window back in time before our senses were blasted with in-your-face bling. I will admit a bias for the AFLAC duck."
5,Excellent exercise program,"I am an experienced orthopedic physical therapist currently focusing on arthritis care. This exercise program has all of the right components for the arthritis sufferer. There are several options for people to adjust the level of intensity for them. The music is a little hokey, but that's the only minor complaint that I have."
2,not pleased,"Although it claimed to be in very good condition without much ware, there were multiple large scratches on the c.d. Also, it was shipped in a re-used envelope in a sloppy manner. Not happy. Will not buy from this name again."
4,she is also a woman,"Tough I think that venessa williams is a very good singer but to gentle to be the spider woman ,I will say some good things about this version of the spider woman. I think that the orchestra is putting the emphasize on every single bit in the musical and playing the music with a grate timing which is excellent .and I think that valentine sings "" the day after that "" in a very convincing and sensitive way and though I liked the original version more...I think this is a very good version and it is worth buying it."
1,What happened to Dean KoontZ?,This book was unreadable. Seemed like he just felt it was time for another Odd Thomas book and cranked this thing out to fill up a certain amount of pages. couldn't finish it......
5,I love the suspense!,"Poor ODD lost his Stormy. Wish he was a real person. I'd go out with him. Although, it would be a little weird having Elvis hanging around."
3,Good for minor jobs,"Has 20 screwdriver tips and the sockets and allen wrenches are both inch and metric. That was a nice surprise, but the hammer is about half-size, which will give you an idea of the size of the other tools. The biggest issue I have is that the screwdriver handle is hollow plastic. It's a shame to have all those screw driver tips and no decent handle to use them with. My advice, if you're planning to do more than small jobs, better shop elsewhere."
4,solid tool set,"Good tool set, looks to be geared for cars. Would rate more highly if it had screwdrivers."
1,WARNING - EXTREMELY OLD STOCK,"I ordered these labels and was shocked when I opened the box - the labels were at about 15 years old, Avery had not used the packaging since 1996, in fact the cover of the package boasted about working with WordPerfect and AmiPro (for those not old enough to remember, these were at one time the premier word processing packages, before Word took over the market). At 15 years old, these labels probably no longer stick, which is why they are being sold so cheaply. Thankfully, Amazon was great and took the item back immediately and issued a refund - you have been warned!"
4,Great advice for entering the U.S. Hispanic market,"Attorney, author and advertising executive Juan Faura spent 25 years studying the dynamics of U.S. Hispanic culture. His hands-on research included months of road trips to meet thousands of people, individually or in groups, in Latin communities from Boston to San Diego. He uses that experience to create composite portraits of U.S. Hispanics, and to contradict or sometimes support long-held marketing stereotypes about this $600-billion annual market. getAbstract recommends his warm, chatty advice to advertisers and marketers who want to reach this large, diverse and still expanding audience. Join his picaresque travels through the land of America's Hispanic consumers to find out what they really want and how you can sell it to them."
3,Boring book,This book is very boring. I had a project for my sociology class and I had to read it. It has very few pictures and unless you want to lear about the aspects of sociology I wouln't recommend. The information is great
4,Great Jazz Rock & Italian Folk fusion,"Great band that i was not aware of until recently. Originally on the same label (Cramps) as the great, great (let me say that again) GREAT Italian band , Area. And although this group does not really have many similarities to Area there are some. like their interest in melding together jazz/ rock with folk influences. All players (six) are really good and project that high energy muscular fusion so characteristic during the 70s. The guitar player comes from the Arti & Mestieri group, so high energy playing comes as no surprise. What really surprised me was their original sound and compositions. There are vocals but used like another instrument, a little bit crazy and weird (which is a lot of fun to listen to). I have their other 1st one and it is also very good. Recommended."
4,I want to hear more,"This is the only Mountain Goats album I've heard and I'm amazed that its this good in light of how material is already out there from this guy. I don't know what to make of the lyrics yet really, maybe pretentious aburd or whatever but I can't remember the last album I heard with authentic poetic lyrics. The music is very impressionable though, gives me goosebumps, heartfelt and magical sounding. check it out. 4 and 1/2 stars probably.I like tracks 1,2,4,5,6 and 8 the best so far."
4,"We, us, ours","Among other things, this album is Darnielle's love letter to the first-person plural pronoun. Anyone over 25 ought to understand the tragic loss involved. There're a couple of clunkers here, but overall it's a wonderful journey back."
5,Great find.,"Excited to find this and discover this author was my great, great uncle! Part of my family history that had been forgotten."
3,"Funny and cute, better then the other rush hour movies","The movie is better then the other Rush hour movies.it has Ziyi Zhang in it, she looks as hot as she ever did, it's funny, a lot of amazing jacky chan fightsthe DVD has nothign going for it really just the movie is worth a damn here.Funny? = YES!!!Ziyi Zhang Is Hot? = YES!!!!Nudity??? = NO!!!! it's a fun jacky chan movie!Good fights? = YES very fun to watchGood plot?? = it's ok....good movie for pizza, beer and friends."
4,Rush Hour 2 Infinifilm Edition,"Dear Amazon,Excellent product, would have been even better with English Subtitles."
5,Rush Hour (Special Edition),DVD was hilarious.DVD arrived in a very timely fashion.DVD arrived in excellent condition.
4,Good DVD but no English subtitle !,"This is a very good action-comedy movie. With Jackie fighting and Chris talking, it is hilarious. All the extras on DVD are worthwhile to watch except that while they are trying to give you so much extras, they forgot the most basic feature which is the English subtitle!The subtitle is the norm for the DVD and I was so disappointed that this was missing. I need this option since Chris talks so fast and I couldn't catch all he said (this is very true since Jackie himself pointed out this fact in one of the extra features).Overall this is an excellent entertaining movie to watch."
4,They made me do this,"I had to do this review for my English class, and I didn't see a movie for a long time. The last movie I saw and remember is Rush Hour 2. The movie was very funny, but especially the scenes that didn't get in the movie that were shown at the end of the movie."
3,A good kick - but nothing else,"Jackie Chan does his thing. Chris Tucker talks does his thing. A good laughs, A few good action shots. Put together the movie is your average action-comedy flick. Nothing exceptional - usual shaky story line.If you're on a tight cinema budget and are looking for a funny action flick check out the Kiss of the Dragon first. Overall not worth the [money]. Without the novelty that Rush Hour had, it is just an average mildly amusing action flick!"
5,hour of the spewing donkeys,I believe that the actors in this film(John leg-o-llama and mr. weinerschnitzel himself!) where eaten by a dog(weinerschnitzel the 3rd) and his friend the cat. I also think that the bird bath(spire-o-weavelington) was knocked over by ME
5,A 2nd Rush of FUN!,"I loved the fist film when it came out, I was hoping this film would be as good, I was oping it could live up to the first one IT DID. This film is absolutely hillarous and has a lot of good action scenes. I heard some people calling this film racist, I don't think it is at all, if anything it shows that two people of different backgrounds and cultures can get along with each other and become good friends. I think Chris Tucker is the funniest man in movies I defenitley hope that he would do more films. Chan also does an excellent job with blending in his unique Chineese fighting skills with Tuckers trash talking this movie defenitley entertains, and that is all a movie should do is: ENTERTAIN YOU!"
1,Humor Misses the Mark,"The plot here is uncreative and tedious. I find Chris Tucker particularly grating. His voice itself is jarring, though I suppose that can't be helped. Moreover, it appears that his character is supposed to typify an attitude of USA-centrism. He needs to spend less time gawking at the foreign culture and making unhumorous cracks and more time adding something to the movie. I found the movie as a whole to be less than amusing."
1,CRAZY CORNY!!!!,"THIS WAS FUNNY FOR A MINUTE.AFTER THAT,IT WAS EXCEDRIN TIME.IN FACT,IT WASNT EVEN FUNNY.MORE LIKE GOOFY SILLINESS.THIS IS LIVING OFF OF PART ONE'S FAME.AND PART ONE WAS ONLY MARGINALLY ENTERTAINING.ALL THIS AMOUNTS TO IS RACIAL GIMMICKTRY.CHAN SAYS SOMETHING IN CHINENGLISH AND TUCKER MOCKS IT.BOORRRRRINGGGG!!!!THE PLOT(IF THERE WAS ONE AT ALL)COULDNT HOLD A COMMERCIAL TOGETHER.THIS AND MOVIES OF THE SAME TREND AMAZE ME ON THEIR POPULARITY.ONE WOULD THINK AN AUDIENCE WOULD BE TOO INTELLEGENT TO FALL FOR SUCH TRIPE.BUT ALAS,TODAYS AUDIENCES ARE MADE UP OF 10-15 YEAR OLDS WHO LIKE THE MOVIE SOLELY ON THE STARS POPULARITY.... THE ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY MUST GO TO CHURCH DAILY THANKING GOD FOR THE PRE-TEENS WHO DONT KNOW ANY BETTER AND THE POOR PARENTS WHO DOLE OUT THE GREENBACKS FOR TRASH I MENTIONED."
2,"Funny, but obnoxious.","There were many take offs from Rush Hour in this sequel, as we all knew there would be from the commercials. As an owner of the first Rush Hour dvd, I'm rather irritated that most of the jokes in Rush Hour 2 seem to come at the expense of women. Breasts seem to be the highlight of the film...seemingly Mr. Ratner was now fresh out of ideas and had to go to stock. Misogyny abounds in this film, even comparisons of women to buffets. Even Jackie Chan has now taken part in such ludicrous objectification. I'm highly disappointed with the quality of entertainment. Zhang Ziyi and the Chinese Vegas partner were the only pure joys in the film. Of course, Zhang Ziyi's fighting scenes didn't do her justice one bit. Tucker and Chan seem to have outworn their charm."
4,Fun movie. Tucker is a tremendous talent.,"In both Rush Hour films, actors Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker bring two long-time cult genres - the Hong Kong action picture and the buddy cop comedy - to the masses. And they do so with a style and freshness that escapes most big budget action flicks. Rush Hour 2 finds our intrepid, odd-couple protagonists in the heart of Hong Kong and in the midst of a complex money laundering scheme. As in the first Rush Hour, the plot could use some work, but the fast-paced action sequences are first class, and the interplay between martial-arts superstar Chan and Tucker - who grows funnier with every film - is priceless...."
3,A disappointment,"Absolutely loved the first one, but this one was just OVER-done. Tucker is usually hilarious when he runs his mouth, but everything he said in this one seemed so forced and unfunny. There were exactly two moments in this movie where I let out a little chuckle. The fighting and action scenes were pretty good...but even those were a step down from chan's usual. He's gettin a little old."
4,very good,a great film with great humor and great action. thank god for chris tucker for the humor and thank god that jakie chan was in this movie. this is a great movie to watch with your friends or kids.acting:3 action:5+ violence:3+ humor:4
4,Undeniably good!,"I am a big fan of the original ""Rush Hour"" and I didn't expect the second one to be as good as the first one. I think the first one is still better, but the second one has more personality to it. For example, instead of just focusing on Chan and Tucker the movie focuses on them and two absolutely STUNNING women!!! Roseyln Sanchez and Zhang Ziyi from Crouching Tiger. The action was toned down, but there were still plenty of memorable moments. Perhaps the reason some critics gave it bad reviews are because either they are too uptight and stuck up or they just don't get this type of humor. Which isn't a knock on them because everyone is intitled to favorite brand of humor. To me and most everyone else I see... Love this movie! There are several laughs to be had and the bloopers at the end of the movie puts the icing on the cake! I definitely will go see it again and get the DVD, which should be out in time for Christmas."
5,More action and drama than before,I liked the movie very much. I thought it was better than the first one because it has more action scenes and some drama to it. I especially liked the scenes with Chris Tucker.
4,It actually *is* as good as the first,"Fans of the first Rush Hour should definitely give this one a view. The undeniable onstage chemistry between Tucker and Chan delivers a very entertaining action/comedy. The first few minutes had me worried that this movie suffered from ""sequel-itis"" but it soon picked up and had me laughing just as the first did. Highly recommended."
5,This movie is the best!,This movie was the most hilarious movie I have ever saw. Everyone in the theatre were all crackin up. I bet whoever watches this will want to see this over and over again!
5,Omar,I rated this 5 stars because I thought it was very funny especially Chris Tucker. I thought Jackie Chan was action and Chris Tucker was comedy. I also thought the bloopers were pretty funny.
4,Entertaining and light.,"Jackie Chan is probably to old to do as many stunts as he used to. Good thing he's a decent actor to boot. I can't say the same for Chris Tucker; they should have done what was necessary to get Chris Rock to play alongside Chan. The Ugly American routine got tiresome rather quickly. Mercifully, Jackie was always there to rescue us from it.The movie itself was at least as good as the original. Even though there was plenty of action, it was still suitable for the 10-14 year old boys it inevitably attracts. Rush Hour is a class act, and it reflects Jackie Chan's desire to make more serious movies.I would give the film 3 1/2 stars, but since I can only assign integers as ratings, I will give it the benefit of the doubt and round it to four."
4,Get ready for a 2nd rush!!!,"A lot better than the original, Rush Hour 2 is choc full of sharp, witty, comical dialogue, exciting action sequences and better acting than its predecessor. The story once again takes us from Hong Kong to Los Angeles and Chris Tucker has come along way since the first movie, he deserved the 20 million he got paid for this film. Jackie's action sequences are lot better and creative in this one and this sequel also stars Zhang Ziyi in her first hollywood film. It once again features bloopers over the end credits and is full of extra features as well. Even if you don't like the original, you may find this movie to your liking. All fans of the first will definitely want to buy this, it is well worth getting.Can't wait for the 3rd installment which hits the big screen in August 2007."
4,Jackie + Tucker = Hk meet Hollywood,"Plot of this one is not guide as stand out as the first rush hourm is a been more complex and sometime non sense, but it turn out funny because of that, comedy scene here won't be as class as the first, but they did add alot hk style in here one which first one is lacking, great cast in this set, however still lacking at some element of worthy 5 star, so i hoped the third one will be best in the series."
2,Should Have Left It At Rush Hour,"Brett Ratner really should have left Rush Hour a stand-alone show. Rush Hour 2 is pretty overblown and it's even annoying enough at times to make one visibly wince. The writers had Tucker go from funny & clever in the first one to downright annoying and obnoxious in this sequel. Some of the sequences were entertaining however, mainly the fight choreography, and the 2 high-powered women (Sanchez and Zhang) help make the movie more interesting, but overall the film falls flat on plot and buddy cop chemistry. 2 stars for introducing some new elements in the Rush Hour saga but failing to deliver in enjoyment value."
2,not impressed....,"well i have to say that i wasn't impressed by the movie. the story is the same as the first one only with other actors. i mean, there were some funny side effects but nothing special. the funny side effects are the exact ones as the first movie."
2,seen it before....,"I liked this movie the first time when it was called Lethal Weapon, I mean Lethal Weapon 2, I mean 48 Hours, etc. I saw every joke coming from a mile away because it was borrowed from every other buddy cop movie ever made. For a younger audience, I'm sure the movie was hilarious, but for a more seasoned audience, it just looks tired and old. It gets 2 stars instead of one because of the nice eye candy in Zhang Ziyi."
3,IT WAS OK,"THIS TIME, THE DUO ENCOUNTERS SOME CHINESE CRIMINALS WHILE ON VACATION IN HONG KONG. NOT AS FUNNY AS THE ORIGINAL, BUT, IT STILL MANAGES TO BE OK. THE HIGHLIGHT OF THIS MOVIE IS ITS EXPLOSIVE FINALE, WHICH TAKES PLACE IN A CASINO. CHRIS TUCKER AND JACKIE CHAN MANAGE TO BE FUNNY ENOUGH TO MAKE THIS SEQUEL WATCHABLE."
4,My Wife Liked It,"I got the movie for my wife. I did not care for this buddy-flick. I am not a fan of either actor, but my wife liked it and I guess that makes it all good."
3,Great Action... Limited story,Movie was fun to watch but much less thought went into the story line. If you liked first movie you will enjoy this one as well.
3,Funny but not great,"Rush Hour 1 was a hilarious film. This follow up, although funny at times lacked the oomph of the first film. It just didn't have the quality humor, non-stop humor of the first. The fight scenes weren't as creative. It was a decent film and worth the rental. After it was over I was left with a feeling that the movie was thrown together because of the success of the first film. You'll laugh but not as hard."
4,pretty much the old one except in China,Rush Hour 2 i thought was going to be better since a lot of people said it was funny. it was kinda funny but most of the funny crap was in the commercials. i still think it was better than the first one.
2,why do these sequels always disappoint?,"One of the most frustrating things about Hollywood is thatonce an executive thinks they have a marketable brand, theystop caring to nurture it. So it is with RH2, a far cry fromthe original. Yes, it's still fun. But not fun-ny. There areso few scenes that are funny, it sets itself up even morefor disappointment when the action is strikingly average fora Jackie Chan picture. If you watch the DVD extras, you get agood impression that the director is a hack, the studio justwanted to make a buck off a sure thing (and they DID), andJackie Chan saved this movie from being much worse with hiscreative input. Oh well."
4,4 1/2 stars,"I loved this movie. I like the first one a tad better, but there are still enough funny jokes and intense stunts to get me through. The bloopers are especially hilarious. I just wish they haven't shown the funniest jokes in their trailers."
3,"I am VEY surprised to say this, but # 2 could have easily been a 4/5 with A FREAKING SCRIPT.","The only real high points in this movie are the stunts and Zihi Zhang. And they both are shown repeatedly. it was nice to see Zihi star in a different role than the period pieces she's been glued to(Daggers, Hero, Musa, Crouching Dragon), she really shines in what she was given here. So not NEARLY as funny as the first, but still a good movie.Now another BIG problem I had with this movie was the lack of hand-to hand full view. The only fighting was close-ups on hand and really not what I wanted to see. I wanna see Jackie show people doing the long-range kungfu that was a staple for about 25 years. i can't stand seeing people fight, but never actually SEEING THEM."
3,"Good Movie, Great DVD","This is a decent movie, I won't go into details on the story, but its a good watch on a slow day.The DVD however is great, tonnes of extras, great video transfer, and some more of those greta outtakes.If you liked the movie, the DVD is a must get, however I did have some problems with the movie, Jackie hasn't made a great film since he took over Hollywood. (for vintage Jackie i recommend the Project A, Police Story and Armour of God series of movies...all of them brilliant)"
5,Extremely Funny and Hilarious and Well Produced,"I enjoyed RUSH HOUR 2 much more than the original. It not only has a better a script, more genuine humor, better fight choreography, a better supporting cast, better acting but the overall production has a richer feel to it. This was a first rate production. Lalo Schifrin&#65533;s score is rich and robust and perfect for this film. After all he did score ENTER THE DRAGON so he is a veteran in that sense. The camaraderie between Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker now has a stronger base and you can feel it. The chemistry is definitely better in this film. The jams they get into are no longer routine but seemed to be well thought out. The villains are a step above the original and are more worthy adversaries with their sophisticated cunning and ability to rebound against our heroes. I definitely enjoyed this one better."
4,Worth the money!,"This was a very funny movie, probably funnier than the first one. Chan and Tucker make a great duo on screen. With Chan's incredible martial arts, and Tuckers zany mouth, they keep your attention on the screen.The movie also brings several gorgeous women to the screen to give you the eye candy that sells movie tickets!The story revolves around a Los Angeles police officer (Tucker) and a Hong Kong detective (Chan) together in China on vacation until an explosion at the United States embassy kills two people. They are thrown into the case to help solve the crime. Their adventures take them from Asia to LA to Las Vegas in search of the Triads and a counterfeiting ring.This one is worth the money!"
5,Spotlight of 2001,"This movie is the funniest movie I've seen this year of 2001. Every year, a movie is made that stays in the spotlight and RUSH HOUR 2 is that movie of 2001. It's funnier than the original, it's more action than the orginal and it's better than the original all around. Not to take anything from the original cuz it was funny too but they outdone themselves in part 2. Unlike Eddie Murphy done with Nutty Professor 2, a total dissappointment but what do he care, he still got PAID! Get RUSH HOUR 2 and you will watch this movie at least 3 times a day if not rewind and rewind and rewind and rewind and rewind.....!!"
2,NOT FUNNY AT ALL,"When you see the trailer of this movie, you lough more than seeing the movie itself.This is a bad sequel, the first RUSH HOUR, was really cool.This one is stupid and not funny at all.Chris Tucker is the only good thing here.Jackie Chan gives me the creeps."
1,Noz a must see!,"junk!!n junk jink!! terrible unfuuny movi thaz waz ruining by Chirs tucker. when will thisz guy become funny?? will thatz day ever happen??!! he just kept on talking TRYING to make a joke after joke. chan wasn't thT GREAT EITHER. really bad movie that i'm suprisedz to knowz people will like.n it just proves anything canz getz made today, and someone will always like it. pure junk......word out!"
2,Ripped off by the postage charge!,"I really wanted this item for a halloween costume this year. The item is very small and lightweight and the charge was 0.99. The postage and handling charge was 7.99! I couldn't believe it so I emailed Amazon to complain. The company owner lowered the postage by $3.00 so I purchased it. I would have cancelled it but I really needed it!I gave this item 2 stars; actually the item itself is just fine, good quality, however the postage charge was so high I was very unsatisfied."
3,Only Women with Women,"Yes, the stories in this book are letters written by women, but what they don't say is that the letters are all about women with women. If that's your thing, then this book is for you, otherwise, you may want to look elsewhere for your erotica."
1,Sucks,"Why anyone would want to read this sick garbage is beyond me, especially when with the right mind set and the partner you have chosen for life, you can make all of our own stories, fantasies and romances come a live. Books like this are only tearing marriages apart and causing divorces."
4,Shows hard times of pioneers.,What a hard journey these people had. I can't even imagine are the hardships and heartbreak they had. These were very brave women.
4,Invaluable historical accounts - great!,Book came in good condition - I have not completed reading it but think it will be great reading -
3,"Greatest ""Hits From the Bong?""","I love Cypress Hill, and I must say that the songs on here should be on a greatest hits album, but like everyone else that commented I fully agree there were just many songs that should have been added. Should have been a 2-disc set.The one thing that I'm surprised I didn't see in any of the other comments which gave me the need to add it is this...why is this album called ""Greatest Hits From the Bong"" when they don't even have the song ""Hits From the Bong""??????? that alone made the rating drop. This greatest hits album would have still been lacking a bit, but at least been acceptable if that song was added."
3,Barely gives me a buzz.,"I've waited a long time for a ""hits"" collection from Cypress Hill, and now that it's out, I see that it's just as disappointing as the House Of Pain ""Best Of"" was. The reasons are many. There's ONLY 10 hits, only 12 tracks, only 50 or so minutes, and many missing tracks. It has three cuts from the debut, two from ""Black Sunday"", and then only one pick from each other album, if that? So I ask, where is ""Pigs"", ""Born To Get Busy"", ""I Wanna Get High"", ""Hits From The Bong"", ""Illusions"", ""Can't Get The Best Of Me"", and others? C'mon! On a positive note, what's here is all good, and this would be a decent start for a new fan, which is the point. Oh, and the full title is ""Greatest Hits From The Bong"", which we always knew it would be called."
