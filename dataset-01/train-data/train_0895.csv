2,Bamboozled and slimed,"The green slime, the add bamboozled me. The acting was fare and the miniatures where very good and very similar to the thunderbirds TV show. The monsters where decent, however the director and camera director should be put against the wall and shoot at dawn(kidding). The directing was so bad it killed any of the good parts of the movie. Well someday I will watch it again to see if there was something good in it I missed,Ha!Pigzilla"
3,Spagetti space Japanese classic,Robert Horton (Wagon Train's scout) makes this movie a little bit slicker than it would have been if someone with less great good looks had played the ultra-hero. Loved this movie when it's florescent green glop rained down on its hapless victims and Robert made himself look good as an interstellar hero a lot like Eastwood but a bit prettier. The Green Slime left a good taste in my mouth as a youngster and prepared me for even greater futuristic dangers and flesh absorbing monsters we would meet out there.. in the great not-yet-known. This movie took 'getting there for granted' when what you found when you got there was largely the whole plot and gee-whiz foundation. Loved it.
3,The Green Slime is Coming,"I actually remember sitting near a window in grade school at P.S. 166 in New York (I was 9 at the time) and seeing a skywriting airplane write ""THE GREEN SLIME IS COMING"". After advertising like that, I went to see this movie with my older brother. We loved it! One of those extra-cheesy space films of the sixties where the women still found time for heavy eye make-up in outer space."
3,A good flick to watch on a rainy afternoon .,"I too saw this when I was a kid, and loved it. Yes, it has cheesy special effects and so-so plot, but hey, so do Godzilla movies and I still enjoy watching one every so often. The Green Slime is entertaining on a rainy day when you have nothing else to do. There are some somewhat notable American actors in this and you can poke fun at the Japanese direction and fx. Even the full grown monsters are a little scary. Just plain fun."
2,Legs have not changed much. Perhaps a tad svelter.,"""Open the door you find the secret. To find the answer is to keep it. You believe it when you find something screaming cross your mind. Green Slime.""Now days the CGI is not good enough to make it look like matures it is difficult o make the sound effects happen a second before or after the event. The last time I heard dialog like this was in ""a funning thing happened on the way to the forumHero: For us there will never be happiness.Philia: We must learn to be happy without it.The movie's namesake looks like kudzu on steroidsThe sci-fi part of the story is just surface dressing. The value of the life of the kudzetts is not important. Neither is important if Jack (Robert Horton) is nimble or quick. The true missing on the film is to determine the best way to command. Wither it is best to be ruthless and by the book or flexible to the point of subordination."
4,Kids Will Love This,"I remember the first time I saw this movies - I was about 10 years old, on a UHF ""Friday Night Frights"" program. I LOVED it! And you gotta love the funky theme song. If your an adult who can sit through a film without takling it too seriously, you'll love this, and if you have boys between the ages of 6-10, they'll love it too."
4,DVD-R!!!!!!!,this movie is deserves better than a DVD-R.too pricey for a DVD-R.shame what they are doing to classics.
4,One of my favourite old movies,"I've been dying to see this movie for ages and ages and this DVD didn't disappoint. Fun, fun, fun. I highly recommend it to anyone considering looking for this movie."
4,Very Solid Work,"(Maybe 4.5) I will admit, upfront, that I haven't read a ton of current mysteries. That being said, I thought this was complex, fun and engrossing. I can agree, coming to this book blind, the first 3 chapters were pretty grim. One death after another, each more horrible than the last. But I enjoyed making my way through it. I enjoyed the chracters. There was only one bit at the end that I thought was an unnecessary, sort of pat wrap-up with the sisters. It felt like it was more a nod to the au currant culture than anything that was integral (or even made sense) for the character."
3,kept waiting,"I kept waiting for the stories to connect, but it never happened, otherwise it was an ok read for me."
2,"high price, low value","This excellent novel is available in other versions that include readers' guide, author interview, better quality paper, bigger margins. It was not suitable for my purpose, reviewing it for a book club. I got a used copy for 50 cents at a book sale that was much better"
3,Not my favorite,"I'm just going going to say not the greatest book I've ever read. Didn't care for the author's style of writing when she came to the end of a paragraph or chapter and on to the next - I kept stopping and going ""what"" and having to reread what I just read becuase it seemed to jump around to much. Not one of my favorites and I read about one book a week so..."
2,Boring,"My daughter thought this book was great. For me, if it's a mystery, I want it full of action and excitement."
3,Not exactly top drawer,"Kate Atkinson is quick out of the gate with several sharply drawn vignettes. The mid-story causes her problems. She attempts to reach beyond the detective genre and add ""Literary"" depth to her story by in-depth interior monologues of all the major characters. The problem is that there is no differentiation between these. Everyone thinks in the same syntax, same vocabulary, about the same trite, shallow and soap opera-like subjects. She's also fond of couching some of the most trites thoughts in parenthesis, which adds to the annoyance. Amateurish. The ""detective in peril"" sublot is also a problem, as it is poorly developed. It feels as if it were bolted on after someone explained to Atkinson that the detective is usually in fear of his life in one of these things. Overall, it missed the mark as crime fiction and missed by a mile as literary fiction. I would suggest Ruth Rendell as someone who writes this sort of novel successfully."
4,sisters in crime,"The best thing about Case Histories is that it is not a murder mystery. Kate Atkinson's novel has many of the characteristics of a traditional murder mystery - sympathetic gumshoe, unsolved crimes, supernumerary suspects, and cats - but the story is more a study of the confusion inherent in the innocent interactions of sisters and daughters.I was pleased by the lifelike, sympathetic presentation of the two male characters. Unfortunately the many female characters never lifted off the page.The plot of Case Histories consists of three unrelated cold cases. All the dramatic tension of the book consists of the promise that these cases will be connected by their resolution. But this resolution fails to materialize. The detective solves one murder, the perpetrator casually confesses to a second, and the third is disclosed only in an anonymous flashback. And the cats live happily ever after."
4,"Good, if a little long.","Perhaps I've developed a short attention span, but I feel this novel wound in a few too many circles around the middle. Just as I began to lose interest, it picked back up again. I liked the way it all wrapped up into a nice package by the end, but again, the middle was a bit convoluted."
4,Well worth it,"This book starts somewhat slow but you soon find it difficult to put down. More a character study than a true detective story but a very well written (dare I say ""literate"") book. I am sure I will buy the next one when it comes out this summer."
2,"Good writing, meh plot","The writing kept me expecting more, but at the end of the day there was no more. I was especially disappointed with the deux ex machina ending of one of the three main ""histories"". But the protagonist is interesting, and perhaps if Atkinson writes more novels with him doing ONE thing instead of several different, disjointed ones then I'll read it."
2,Highly overrated.,"Case Histories is what happens when someone has three ideas for mysteries, but discovers that none of them has enough heft to carry an entire book. Instead they're thrown haphazardly together, given some tangential coincidental relationships and packaged as a whole. It didn't take me long to finish the book; I couldn't wait to find the hidden thread that connected the three stories in a logical manner--unfortunately it doesn't exist. After that, the implausible string of coincidences that would neatly fit in to the overall story are just left as an implausible string of coincidences.Having said that, the characters are interesting and the novel is very well written. Atkinson consistently jumps forward and backward a few hours at a time, and you'll tear ahead to find out what happened at the last cliffhanger. I'd definitely try something else by her, but I wouldn't recommend Case Histories to anyone I like."
1,prozac should be included with this book,it is tedious and depressing. there is not one normal person described and all the families are dysfunctional and unhappy. save your money. this book serves only for kindling the fireplace!
1,Confusion reigns,I read this for our book club and would not recommend it to anyone else to read. There were so many compound/complex sentences that I had to keep reviewing what I had read...ugh. There were too many characters to keep track of...and most were not described well enough to be memorable. End was short...like she ran out of gas and just had to quickly close it all. Will not read more of her books.
2,"Starts out promising, but...","I, too, was drawn to this book because of the lavish praise on the cover. The crimes are interesting, as is Jackson's life. But, the rest of the characters are unlikeable and awkward. The author uses a lot more crude language and sexual reference than is necessary. The lesbian scene at the end was just gross and I really wish I could retract it from my memory."
1,Save yourself - move away from this one.,This is easily one of the worst books I have ever actually completed reading. The story-line is both trite and contrived. The characters are unbelievable - the dialog/ue simply impossible. The situations are so cliched as to be laughable; indeed I wondered part way through if this was a parody.The author appears obsessed to an unhealthy degree with child molestation and overall seems to have a weirdly unbalanced outlook on human nature (even for a murder mystery writer). It is almost as if the book has been written by pasting cuttings from the 'Daily Mail' (a notoriously right-wing British tabloid) in the manner of an anonymous letter.Simply awful!
1,So boring!,"I was so disappointed in this book - I thought I would upgrade my love of thriller books and read a ""literary"" thriller, but this wasn't up to my expectations one iota. I lost interest in the book half way through and didn't even finish it - there were so many wordy descriptions that were so boring, it would make me lose any continuity to the story line. I couldn't even classify this as a ""thriller"" in my opinion. I don't recommend buying it - go to the library if you're curious and get a look-see for FREE."
3,"Another of those ""hurry up and end it"" books","Up until the last chapter, I might have given this book a ""4"" (even though there are just TOO many incredible coincidences). But the ENDING! Ye gads! What a disappointment!"
1,I Wish I Had Known!!,"I got this book through a paperback swap web site and thought it sounded interesting. If I had known about all the complimentary blurbs on the book's covers, I wouldn't have bothered (because every book I've ever tried to read that had all those blurbs has been a disappointment). I really don't think the people who write them have ever read the book! Oh, well, at least I didn't waste my time reading the whole thing. Boring, boring, boring."
2,confusion,I think the author had as much difficulty keeping these case histories straight as I did. My high hopes for this book were not met. I trusted too many other good reviews and was very disappointed.
3,Too many stories,"The character of Jackson Brodie shows promise for a series. However, I was not compelled to read more about him. I found the ""cases"" to be too weak to hold my interest."
3,not a thriller,"Did not find this novel a really good read. Not much suspense and a slow pace. I am much more comfortable with books thatdelve deeper into the actual police work. Kate Atkinson was highly recommended to me, but is not my cup of tea."
4,odd characters,"Good story lines, good author, currently reading ""One Good Turn"".""Case Histories"" moves well, disfunctional characters, comes together well at end."
2,"starts well, slogs to a finish","The early chapters of the crimes and the characters within the families were wonderfully done and captivating. The middle of the book bogged down for me as I could not keep the characters straight and lost interest in them because of it.I began to lose interest when the mathematician died.I would have liked to have known more about the detective ... I didn't connect with him at all, really.That said, the early chapters are worth the read, even if, like I did, you give up half way through."
2,Typical mystery - nothing special,"This is a story of 3 different murders that are somehow linked with each other. There is an investigator who is investigating the murders years later. There is nothing special or clever about the stories. If you like murder mysteries, you will enjoy this one. Perhaps it was a bad choice for my taste which is why I gave it 2 stars as opposed to 1. Some of the characters have depth, but the reader does not connect with most of the others. Another criticism is that the author puts a lot of of stuff in parentheses which I find annoying.If you like the Lifetime channel or murder mysteries read this book, but do not expect anything particularly special."
1,Surprisingly disappointed!!,"I was anxious to read this book once I read all the great reviews for it, especially the endorsement from Stephen King as a must-read. However, the whole book from start to finish was depressing! I didn't like a single character and I cared even less what happened to them, but I was determined to finish what I start, hoping that the author would pull together a great ending. Nope!!! Oh well, maybe next time I get adventurous to try something new, it will actually be worth my time."
1,An absolutely boring and awful book,"I kept forcing myself to finish this book because I figured that it must get better (I don't know how it is getting such good reviews), but it never did. I wish I never wasted my time reading this book.I love crime/detective novels, but this was not one of them. The author spends the whole time describing these crazy characters, then the book ends with all of the crimes miraculously getting solved. The detective does not follow the clues to solve the crimes, they just sort of get resolved. There was no climax to this book, so don't waste your time."
1,A Study in Malevolence,"I have to admit that I could not finish this book. It was so tragically malevolent that I stopped part way through and then read the end. It was even more terrible than the beginning. If you want to explore a nightmare world where tragedy and hopelesness rule the day, this is the book is for you. It you seek a vision of competence, of happiness, of people achieving values despite struggle, then I suggest you read another author."
1,Very disappointing,"Well written in parts, but too scattered and rotten ending. I thought Stephen King had better taste than this."
4,"beautiful engrossing novel, ending too pat","I have read all of Kate's novels, and love them. She knows how to grab the reader, and does. The characters are fascinating (although I wasn't as impressed with Brodie as some other reviewers are, he's too good). For most of the others, you want to reach out and help them (or kill them, depending on the character),The only weakness of the novel is the ending - too many ends neatly tied up.Nevertheless, this is a must read for any reader."
4,If only...,"The book is generally well written and enjoyable. I liked the characters and the way the story fell together. What bothers me are mistakes in grammar/punctuation by a professional writer - ""alright"", ""he would have hated to have been sitting with them"", ""six months' pregnant"", ""fifteen years' missing"" [with the apostrophe], a man ""lay the bike down"" instead of ""laid"", the incorrect use of ""who"" for ""whom"". These kinds of things are distractions from an otherwise good book, and they would be easily preventable by a thorough proofreading or more careful writing."
4,Fun Book with Dark Matter,"This book is like a song with a catchy hook as well as moving lyrics - she can do it all. Atkinson writes like a dream, with fully fleshed-out characters who all have dark pasts but that does not stop them from being terribly entertaining. One gets the satisfaction of feeling sufficiently ""literary"" in reading this novel, but also get caught up in an engrossing tale that will surely get made into a movie one of these days."
2,Too Disjointed,i keep trying to read kate atkinsons novels but this is my last attempt. The style of disparate characters coming on stage and then dissappearing to reappear again later on is very hard to follow. Disjointed work with patches of brilliant writing.
1,Left you in the air.,I did not like this book at all. It left you hanging not knowing what happened next. Interesting at first.
3,Expectations too high...,"After Stephen King's recommendation of this book, I rushed to order it. I launched into it with the highest hopes, and read with particular care and interest to find all the clues because these small plots were all going to be tied together. Perhaps if my expectations had been lower, I would have enjoyed the book more. As it was, the plots are tied together in a slim way. Don't bother worrying about clues as you are reading. Some characteristics about Jackson, the investigator, were enjoyable and realistic. His relationship with his ex, for example. But the author threw in an unbelievable plot line that had Jackson's life threatened, and it wasn't believable, well drawn, or necessary. It seemed she might have written it in to provide some action for a future movie version. The book is okay, maybe even pretty good. With that in mind, read it and enjoy."
5,I could read it again!,"I agree that some of this book was painful as a mother to read but it definitely was one I could not put down! I definitely recommend to all, not only for the mystery but for the sharp wit that Ms. Atkinson includes throughout the book. A good comic relief at just the right moments!"
4,It Gets Better As The Story Progresses,"Like some other readers , I had very high expectations for Case Histories. I am a little disappointed. It was a good novel. but, I wouldn't consider great. There are a few mysteries in the story but, it really isn't a hard core mystery novel or a crime novel. There are many likeable and sympathtic characters. The book is about how tragedies of a criminal nature effected families. I liked the protagonist Jackson.The story does get better as you get more into it. The ending was satisfying. I would rate this novel A -."
1,Incoherent,"I bought ""Case Histories: A Novel"" because it was #1 on Stephen King's ""Best Books of 2005"" list in Entertainment Weekly.I stuggled to get through it. The first several chapters seemingly had no relationship to each other. When there is an attempt to tie the characters together all the unfocused prose adds to the confusion.I can not recommend this book."
3,"3 Stars, but I'm being generous","I finished this book, but it was tough. It is very ""British"" in both style and substance, with expressions and references only an Anglophile and/or those from Britain would understand."
1,Would not waste a penny on this one,This is not worth the paper it is printed on. What a waste of money and time!!NEXT!!
2,unfinished,"Seemed like a good start, however pages 25 - 57 were missing and I had to return it, Am waiting for you to send it to me and I will be happy to review it then"
2,meh. not great.,"When I started the book, after the first chapter, I thought that it was a book of short stories... It would have been a much much better book if it was... As it is, the story started out strong and progressively went down hill. The ending was beyond predictable, the characters became tedious and it felt like the book was very drawn out."
3,"Okay, but why the hype???","I just bought this book because Stephen King said it was the best book of the year.Well, I just finished it and I'm not feeling it's anything special. Haven't I read a million books like this before?It's well-written and I like the author's dark humor, but where is this alleged greatness? Where is the ""deft story weaving""?I don't believe the story came together and I'm scratching my head wondering what the story line of Michell/Caroline had to do with the other stories?When I was 3/4 the way through the book, I evaluated it as fair, and I looked forward to this supposed grand finale where everything would ""come together.""Sorry, but I didn't get the feeling that things came together very much.I finished the book just thinking that I read a routine mystery.If anyone could point out to me what I've missed, please do. Email me at azee8996@yahoo.com"
2,"Stephen, how could you?!?","I picked this up at the library this afternoon solely because of Stephen King's high praise, and now I'm wondering if I should bother with the other two books I also checked out at his recommendation. The book is well and often wittily written (NOT well-constructed, mind you), and I afford it two stars for that, but that's the only good thing I can say about it. The protagonist is so poorly fleshed-out that I never even bothered to form a picture of him in my head (and certainly don't care what he may be up to in her next novel), and the remaining characters are either equally boring or so over-the-top as to be unbelievable. The most annoying, unsatisfying, unforgivable thing however is the author's lazy use of the deux ex machina to ""tie up"" one of the story lines. This felt like three short stories - only one of them at all compelling - forced together to make up a ""novel."" Really, really disappointing."
5,Murdoch/Drabble/Howard,"Oh ""golly"" ... if you like Iris Murdoch, Margaret Drabble, and/or Elizabeth Jane Howard, on the English side, or Lee Child and/or Harlen Coben, on the American side, you are really going to like Kate Atkinson's ""Case Histories"". I have just finished it, loved it, and my next activity will be to order all her other books. The characters! The descriptive excellence! Jackson the detective! This is our kind of book, kids, and it should be on some Murdoch-Drabble-Howard list ... really immensely enjoyable!"
2,You Are Kidding Me - Right?,"Read the many reviews - they say this book is above and beyond. I'd say the hype is over the top and the ending horrendous. I thought the author would eventually do a phenomenal job wrapping all the pieces of the puzzle together - she did not. The ending was contrived.If you are grading on writing alone, I believe I would have given four stars. Grading on plot, climax, and ending - two stars and that's grading on the curve."
4,Interesting....,"I really liked this book...I found myself trying to read it every spare moment I had. A little dark, a little twisted but I liked the mystery, character analysis, jarring details...might not be for everyone, but I'm looking forward to reading another of her books!"
3,"Loved the TV adaptation, the novel not as much","I didn't really like how the novel jumps around, nor did I think the characters in the novel were as interesting as in the film. It was difficult for me to feel any empathy for most of the characters, other than Caroline and Theo.In the film, they did well to emphasize the secretary and Jackson's daughter, the most engaging characters in my opinion. Also, by making Laura's murder contemporary to the plot, it was possible to bring that case to a satisfying conclusion.I'm not sure why they needed to move the site of the action to Edinburgh from Cambridge, other than perhaps to fit the accents of the actors better."
4,Case Histories,Good book. Kept me reading right to the end. Liked it very much. All tied in really well in the end
2,Good start - boring finish,"Started of well - interesting characters and a nice melancholy tone to the whole thing. But after the first 1/3 of the novel, it dragged horribly to the point where I was so bored I didn't care who the murderers were."
2,Case Histories,"Not a bad book, per se. Great writing, funny, good characters. It was really more like three novels than one, or two short stories and one novel. One story (of Theo and his daughter) could have been omitted in my opinion. Just could have been better story-wise."
4,A Case for Kate,"Kate Atkinson is a master of intrigue-In ""Case Histories"" she has done a masterful job of weaving many stories into a novel of mystery which is spellbinding."
3,love this series,"This book is the first in the Jackson Brodie series, which I became addicted to. He is a great character, among many, with true-to-life (unlike some of the situations that the same characters find themselves in) inner conversations that seem familiar yet original. I can't wait for the next in the series."
3,Formulaic but still enjoyable,"I read the reviews and noticed a pattern: Those who picked it up because it was recommended by Stephen King were sorely disappointed. Well, I had no idea that it was recommended by him and had I known, I probably would not have read it. It was gifted to me by my sister who enjoys this author. I must admit it took a bit to get into because I found Rosemary's character incredibly depressing. However, once I was in the thick of things, I couldn't put the book down. I agree with the reviews which said some characters were not fully developed. It seemed like the author researched everything just enough to make a story out of it. In other words, it lacked passion. Nonetheless, it was quite enjoyable, though very formulaic at times. I don't think I will go out of my way to read another book written by Ms. Atkinson but I did enjoy this one while it lasted."
3,The Reader Sees What Those Involved Can Not See,"Several mysterious 'cases' blend together unknowingly though the years. We, as readers, can see the connections while those who are involved in the 'cases', or impacted by them, do not connect the dots. We see what they can not see.I began this book with great expectations and ended it disappointed. The cases lacked verite' and the revelations of the cases were not particularly important to me. I wanted the book to be more than it was."
5,Case Histories,"Kate Atkinson is one of my favorite authors, she always produces amazing stories with very tangible and likeable characters, the plots are excellent."
5,Great!,"Great - understated. Clever, emotional, poignant but not shmaltzy. V interesting how the plots became interwoven - not contrived. Very enjoyable"
2,so overrated,"Please do not believe the hype with this book. (I should preface this by saying that I finished reading a Cormac McCarthy novel last week, so perhaps my palette is scarred.) The characters wallow about with too much lame dialogue and expected idiosyncrasies. The plot starts out at 80 mph, only to sputter to a geriatric standstill by the 5th chapter. I kept turning pages hoping it would get better, be written better, and seem like less of a Lifetime channel movie you watch on sick days. Sadly, dear potential reader, it never did. When I finished the last page I immediately walked outside and left it on the curb, saddened that it ever occupied a place on my bookshelf. If you want to read it, you can find it outside on the sidewalk and save yourself the shipping charges."
2,Not Sure What the Hype Is,"I really wanted to like this novel. Was looking to sink my teeth into it. The book got off to a good start but soon I began to feel cheated. The ending was dismal. As a detective novel this book fails miserably. Trying to unravel the clues is useless. As a literary work, this also piece also fails. Although some characters are well developed, others are one dimensionally vilified and demonized."
3,"Good read but, as the title implies ""case history""","Kate Atkinson is definitely a skilled writer but, if you are anticipating a real private investigator mystery novel you may be somewhat disappointed. The story, for a good part of the book, is indeed a series of case histories of several dysfunctional families. Jackson Brody, the P.I., doesn't even appear until about half way through the book and up til that point the pace can be quite slow and many details perhaps overly drawn out. Once Jackson becomes involved in the story line, things improve considerably. I normally watch the video versions after reading the book but, in this case, I stumbled across the TV series first and then decided to read the book which proved to be somewhat of a let down by comparison. But give it a try, you may not agree with my assessment; it's definitely well written."
5,Overlapping Plotlines Stimulate the Reader,"Atkinson is well known, but I had never read anything by her. ""Case Histories"" is a somewhat complicated plot because it is told from several perspectives, but it is not a unique style. Virginia Woolf taught us to appreciate the style in ""The Waves."" Atkinson is indebted to her for the concept, perhaps, but the linchpin of the structure is her inspiration to have a private eye connect the dots. Great way to spend a lazy summer afternoon. I am indebted to Amazon's prodigious listings for my introduction to Ms. Atkinson."
2,Not your usual mystery novel,"I was prompted to buy and read Case Histories after hearing it discussed on a radio program on Diane Reems' public broadcasting station. The panel members were almost unanimous in faulting it as a mystery novel, but said the characterizations, wit and style (particularly the details of setting) lifted the novel out of the realm of the ordinary. I have to agree, although I found some of the sexual overtones offensive and unnecessary (unless that's what a young writer has to include in order to sell her book). The ""solution"" to the mystery of each case history was disappointing. I understand that a sequel is planned in which the detective will be re-introduced. I do not plan to buy the sequel."
3,Depressing,"I looked forward to reading this book as I enjoyed the author's ""When Will There Be Good News"". I read it without reading any reviews, which was a mistake. The first chapter, about a beloved 3 year old girl who goes missing was very good. The next chapter had another tragedy and was good. By the 3rd chapter (and 3rd death) I was wondering if the whole book was one depressing short story after another.The author then began to weave the stories together, but with added sub-plots and details that I found unbelievable and overdone. This was not a terrible book, just trite, depressing, and, at the end, confusing. It ends rather abruptly. Not the author's best work."
3,Is everyone really this messed up?,"With a heavy heart I rushed to finish this book, mostly because I wanted it to be over, partially because I wanted to find out the answers to the mysteries of the three cases. <a href=""http://www.ew.com/ew/article/commentary/0,6115,1141302_5|111144||0_0_,00.html"">Stephen King names this the best book of 2005</a>, with this reccomendation I bought it for my wife and after she finished I sat down to read it. However the subject matter grew out of such human and personal depravity that I was really put off by the nature of the story, the casual and repugnant sexual incidents. Since Atkinson miracously weaves all the story lines together, the book really gives a pervading sense of hopelessness, almost as if entire society seems to have so many laden problems it will just mire in the filth of its circumstances. Well written, but not uplifting or in my opinion worth the cost of reading it.http://www.niffgurd.com/mark/books/2006.html#case"
4,punks are drunks all over,"This book didn't start out as a pageturner, but I read it over three nights, staying up late to finish it the last. So you could say I couldn't put it down. Characters are upper class Irish Catholics in Dublin. Enlightening view of new territory -- after reading McCourt's nonfiction, Uris, and various native Irish writers, I had no idea such a group existed -- at least not over there. Drinking stories of the pinting-crew are entertaining. No nudity or sex, little violence, one chase scene but whole tale held my attention. It's an entertaining, contemporary look at modern Ireland."
5,Worth waiting for!,"Considering the performance history of this opera, one would assume that there would be a wide selection of visual performances from which to choose. However, I have been waiting a long time for a DVD of Faust to use in a course I teach on opera and am delighted that this performance has finally been released. It was worth the wait. The cast is outstanding and the production concept very interesting. Not only is the ballet included, it conveys the utter perversity of Mephistopheles' domain better than in any other production I have seen. Angela Gheorghiu and Roberto Alagna are superb as Marguerite and Faust. Her final aria is particularly moving. Simon Keenlyside, whose Hamlet is the current gold standard, is always commanding and one wishes that Valentin, and Sophie Koch's Siebel, had longer roles. For anyone who loves the opera Faust, this is a treasure."
1,Poor performers,I was very disappointed in the voices of theerformers - especially the men. Didn't like the choreography or interpretation. This opera is more enjoyable by a different company and director.
3,Didn't like it,If you are watching an opera solely for the talent then I would say this is one to watch. Marguerite didn't come across as an innocent young girl. And I think some of the scenes were overdone. It's not one I want to watch again.
1,A disc to be avoided by fans of Django,"This disc is a trivialisation of the music that Django and other contemporaries strived to articulate with such talent.This is no comparison to ""Roots to Django"" also by Bireli Lagrene.The latter is a work of love and respect while 'My favorite Django"" is at best ""lift music""... Django fans stay away"
3,This item is different from the one shown in pictures,"I chosen this one, because it looks foldable in the third picture. But when I received it, I was so disappointed to find it's not the truth."
3,Can't say I didn't have fun,"This is one of Jess Franco's ""period"" gothics where you still might see a peasant wear go-go boots or Frankenstein pull up to the castle in a limo when everyone else is in horse and buggy. Frankenstein and trusty monster zip up to Dracula's castle to revive the staked count, and create an army of electrified zombie-vampires who will obey and help him rule humanity. However the local gypsies are fed up with this stuff, and send a pasty-faced werewolf the doctor's way to mix things up.Full of Franco's slap-dash, choppy, stream-of consciousness technique, the film nonetheless delivers the delirium Franco-fans savor. So turn a blind eye to that plug-socket on the wall of the vampire's crypt, those dime-store rubber bats, and all that day-for-night photography, and have a little fun."
5,Subtle Genuis,Many things have been written and said about Mr. Franco...some true some well..who knows...what I can say is this particular film stands with the best of Jesus's works. His approach to imagery and abstraction in this particular film is in a word remarkable. It's a film whose story is secondary to the atmosphere and dialogue. Simply put it's a film whose visual importance and potentcy is absolutely under appreciated. I would consider this film to be one of the top 5 Franco works. Essential to any fan of the more off beat kind of horror films.
4,great,"More great prog from the Vertigo cannon. Atlantis have all the features of most early 70s prog bands: mutiple part songs, sneaky time signitures, keyboards, keyboadrs and more keyboadsBut this band had molodic insticts. The songs are almost pop in parts, with hummable melodic lines, played a lot with a delecate chime from a Fender Rhodes. Yet, the long avanues and sudden changes in rhythm in a lot of the numbers will quickly inform you, Atlantis was far from being a pop group. You could compare them to Yes, or Caravan, not so much in their sound, but their emphasis on melody and the pastorial over the disonece of bands like Egg and Vander Graff Generator. But Atalantis could also rock when they wanted, and that is clearly in evidence on this album.Prog far above average. (Of course, it was on Vertigo)"
2,Malachi's Cove,"This book is about a young girl called Mally Trenglos. She collects seaweed to sell as manure for her uncle who is now to old to do the job himself. A young man named Barty decides to collect the seaweed himself instead of paying for it. This leads to a disagreement between Barty and Mally. They decide to have a contest to see who can collect the most seaweed. Barty falls in and knocks himself unconcious. Mally saves his life, and as he awakens he asks to see Mally. He thanks her. They then get married and Mally moves in with Barty. I would recommend this book to people who enjoy late 1600 stories and love stories."
4,Drn - Xenologix,"Dron offers some skittering electronic music on their album Xenologix. Although most of the tracks are backed by rhythmic elements (the peppy ""Ski,"" for instance, skates by on icy percussion), others (like ""Enhale"") drift by entirely on ambience. Sustained chords and tinkling melodies prove for enjoyable music -- something best listened to late at night, preferably on headphones. On ""Caltron,"" the humming tones and crackling sounds, like chitinous insects breaking apart, are both calming and disturbing. ""Toob"" is darker and slightly faster, while ""3 AM Drive"" retains the darkness but not the velocity. Would this fall under the banner of IDM? I would argue so. So go ahead, invite Xenologix into your home."
4,Ida is the best band that nobody's heard of,"Their first two albums are way better than this one, although I love this one as well. ""Ten Small Paces"" has a quirky mood to it that the others don't, but I would DEFINATELY check out the other two first."
4,"Solid CD, but sometimes it tends to drift","This CD has moments of sheer beauty, the kinds of sounds that draw you back to it again and again. It also, unfortunately, tends to be _very_ slow and lumbering. It's a melancholy affair for the most part with little drumming and a lot of space. It can be quite pleasing but to me comes off as choppy and disjointed."
4,Trestle Desk,"This is a beautiful desk and is very spacious--it would be quite sturdy except the pre-drilled holes on one side of the desk were about an inch off, so that I could not assemble one side. Tried drilling my own holes but could not get around the table leg with an automatic drill. Carpenter's glue did not help much either. Hopefully it will not need to be moved too often. I purchased this at a discounted rate, so I guess you get what you pay for, but it would have been nice if the defects had been stated online so I knew what I was getting myself into."
4,Lights entire room great floor button switch,"Great lamp that really helps light an entire high ceiling guest room. It's not quite as tall as I pictured, but still works very well. I also love that the on/off switch is on a flat disk on the floor so you can turn on the light with your foot in the dark. The quality is high, what you should expect from a pretty expensive item. The glass on the top is thick and when put together the entire lamp is very sturdy."
3,Not Espresso,"As others have said, a good looking lamp, easy to assemble. good light but the color is much lighter than pictured. Checking Minwax stain color chart, it is more like English Chestnut, which is a lovely color just NOT expresso as pictured."
1,Very wimpy lamp for a large price,Lamp was much more petite than it appeared in photo. Did not have a quality appearance. The glass shade was exceptionally thin and fragile and arrived broken. Lamp not worth anywhere near its price.
5,MICKEY MARCUS WAS A MAN WHO LOVED FREEDOM,"This book is a fantastic biography of an amazing man. He is a man who should be loved by those who love freedom, and hated by those who despise freedom. This book intimately details the sacrifices of this war hero in both WWII and the Israeli War of Independence. Ted Berkman does a superb job in documenting the feats of this man, enabling David Mickey Marcus to serve as a role model for future generations."
3,new NANO no fit,"Was really sad when I tried to dock my new 2G Nano. Apparently, there is NO communication between the quality control of the two companies. The INSERT supplied with the IH6 for the Nano, doesn't allow the unit to dock properly. The hole isn't cut at proper size. Such a pitiful mistake. I like the IH6.sp"
1,Junk,It just doesn't work.. Brand new out of the box it wont respond to radio buttons or Ipod controls. Not supported on website. The clock works. I guess I can time how long I'm not listening to music.
2,hard to use,"not particuarly intuitive, alarm hard to set, and has this really huge box on the outlet plug, which i don't know why is necessary for a simple alarm clock/ radio"
2,No good for long term use,The volume and tuner spindal wheels don't work after a few years. Spend your money on a better one instead.
4,Great sound for such a small radio,"I love the sound this machine produces. It feels as if I have a much larger speaker system in my room. For as small as it is, the sound quality if by far the best I have heard. I primarily bought it for the ipod/radio function and i have no complaints."
4,Great option for listening to music from your iPod,"I needed a new bedside alarm clock, and when I started investigating what I wantd to buy, I decided to look for something that could also play music from my iPod. I'm very pleased with the purchase. This product looks great, is easy to use, and the music sounds great. It charges the iPod while it's in the docking station which is a great way to ensure I always have a fully-charged device. My only complaint would be that the light from the clock radio is too bright at night. There may be a way to turn it down, but I haven't figured it out yet."
4,"Alright, Now This Is A Cool Little Gadget!","I was in search for an alarm clock/iPod stereo, and I came across the iHome iH6. Read a couple of reviews and decided to get it. It turned out to be a great product. Although a little pricey for my taste, the iH6 has great sound quality, it's easy-to-use, and the ability to utilized two alarms at once, one with the radio/ one with an iPod, made it even better. I particularly like the gradual increase in volume with the iPod alarm, so the music doesn't just blast your ears out at 6 A.M. I found only one thing I didn't like about it. If you are one of those people who like to listen to soft music as you fall asleep, the next morning the alarm will be as soft as you put it the night before. It kind of sucks, especially if you're a deep sleeper. Other than that, the iHome iH6 is a great product and would recommend it to anyone in search of a new iPod-compatible alarm clock, or just a great iPod stereo."
2,Can't wake to the shuffle,"We bought this clock because it seemed to work with the iPod shuffle. However, even though alarm 1 has the option to wake to an iPod, that doesn't include a shuffle iPod. I called iHome about this, and was told that it also doesn't charge the shuffle (although it seems to be doing so when we use it)."
4,A necessary piece for the iPod,"There's little to say about the iH6 Clock Radio. It does what you need it to do (wake you up with buzzer, radio or iPod), it sounds good (acoustic chamber design) and is easy to use (convenient controls on the top of the unit). The unit is a little pricy, but the small remote control helps offset that. The instruction manual is almost unnecessary, too (which speaks to the design). I also like that it keeps the iPod charged and available at all times."
4,"Great features, easy to setup","I originally bought my daughter an iLive IBCD3816DT boombox for her birthday. The hiss was unbearable, so I took it back and purchased this product. Much better quality control and it docks perfectly with her 2GB ipod nano using the supplied insert. Very pleased with this product and would recommend it to anyone. It sounds great, looks good, and the controls are very intuitive."
2,Does not include required iPod inserts,"I bought the white iHome IH6 from Apple along with a 2G Nano. The directions say you must use the proper insert for your iPod and it includes 5 inserts. None of the inserts support the current 2G Nano nor the Mini, Apples best selling model. The directions helpfully suggest that you may _purchase_ inserts for your iPod. What a crock!I plan to confront iHome and Apple. If they do not give me the inserts for my iPods, I will return the IH6 and move on. Why is buying consumer goods always such a pain?"
4,Christmas Present,My son had ask for one of these for Christmas. Truth be told he does not even know he is getting this. It is still in the package it arrived in.
2,DOES NOT WORK WITH SHUFFLE,"Despite the product description (and even the box packaging!), the claim that this product works with the Shuffle is incorrect. IT DOES NOT WORK WITH THE NEW, TINY iPOD SHUFFLE. It only works with the old, ""stick"" form-factor Shuffle.So: cool design, looks and sounds great, but does not work as advertised."
3,Good until it stopprd.,Lived up to it's favorable reviews for around a yesr. Then no audio in any mode. 90 day warranty should be a warning. $30 repair charge plus shipping when out of warranty means go look for something new and hopefully more quality.
4,Great Clock Radio,"I purchased this for my wife as a Christmas present. She has loved it from day 1. The sound is great, set up seemed easy (she never asked for help!). I read other reviews about the time display being very bright, it is but the dim setting ends that issue. The only reason I do not give 5 stars is it appears if you fall asleep with your iPod playing you can not wake up to a buzzer, only music. I don't have a problem with waking up to music but my wife is a little concerned she will sleep through the alarm. To date she has not."
2,Pitiful AM reception,"I realize that most people buy this product to play their iPods through it. However, when a product is advertised as an AM/FM radio, you expect to get exactly that. The AM reception in this device is so pitiful you would think you were listening to an old Japanese transistor radio from the late '60's. Very disappointing to say the least. We still have this player, but the under-counter device from iHome was so bad we donated it to a fund raising auction. There is something wrong with the engineering iHome is putting into their AM receivers - or maybe they're not engineering them at all. Maybe they are left over from an old Japanese warehouse."
2,One significant design flaw,"If you are looking for an IPod alarm system this is your machine. The reviewer comments about good sound quality are on the mark. But it has one serious design flaw at least for how I wanted to use it and I'm returning mine. I thought it was a dual IPod/Radio alarm system, as advertised. It is not. The radio alarm is only a second alarm, apparently for a second sleeper. You cannot select between the two options. Tried the work around of setting the second alarm to go off first but you can't not set Ipod alarm so when it (or the buzzer) goes off it shuts down the radio. Can't understand why they couldn't have worked around this issue but beware if you want choice and flexibility in what you wake to."
4,"Great for the office, but....","I just got this and it works very well. I first bought the Eton Sound 50 Speaker Dock, which had a great sound, but the problem with it was that it was too loud for the office. I finally decided to get this one and having used both now, I can say this is the better system, for the office. The reason is that this system is much quieter than the Eton system. I haven't tested its highs yet, but it's lows are low enough that I can play any type of music I want. With my old system, I was only able to play solo piano music.The only aspect to this system I do not like as compared with the Eton speakers is the functionality of the remote. With the Eton system I was able to control the iPod completely with my remote so that I could scroll through menus and select songs. With this sytem, the remote only allows you to skip to the next/previous song and not through the menus. It's a definite drawback if you plan to put the dock further than arms' reach away."
2,iPod and Radio Player,works well for iPod and AM. Does not pick up AM well at all. we returned it since we could not get our favorite channels on FM.
4,Very cool alarm clock,"I wanted a nice iPod alarm/radio for my bedroom and this device is almost perfect. The radio works well, very good volume to listen to it and the ipod both. I use it with my 30 gig video iPod. The tiny remote is cool you can change volume, the songs, etc.I like the overall black and silver colors however the orange led light on top buttons doesn't really match the silverish/blue light the front clock led lets off. There is a dimmer for the front led but still I don't really like the orange light on top. Maybe I can find a way to turn it off.It doesn't seem like you can have the iPod as your wakeup on BOTH alarms, just the first, and the second to the radio. I'm not sure yet if it has a regular ""alarm"" sound but who even needs that awful noise.So far...so good!"
1,This piece of $%&* doesn't work!,"What a waste of money! First, when I plug in the multitap, the start buttons don't work on any of my controllers, rendering most games unplayable. I don't know if the other buttons work, because the in the game I'm testing on, you have to press start before you get to any menus. The video out on the AV selector part doesn't work either! I hear sounds, but it misses the point of ""video"" games. I am very good at hooking up wires and following directions, and there is really very little room for error, so I don't think it is an ""installation' problem. The ""manual"" (a 6""x6"" slip of paper) is not very clear and the buttons don't do what they say they should on the remote. If I continue testing it and find I am wrong, I will update this review, but for now, be warned! This thing bites!"
4,Works great!,"The multi-tap connects right under your Slim PS2. Takes up very little space. I gave it 4 stars only because out of 200 + games I have, 2 games didn't work with it (super monkey ball dx is one of them). I wish it was compatible with all the games. Also, the multi-tap does not connect to the PS2, it just sits under it, if you pull the controller, the PS2 can slide off."
1,Doesn't work,I tried two different ones and could not get either one to work at all with teh new PS2 slim. Couldn't even get a light on.; Maybe the PS2 slim doesn't prove enough power to it. I wish it did work becuase I bought it on clearance for $9.00 at Toys R US.
4,Enjoyable book,"I am a huge fan of Michael Moorcock's Elric series and because of my high opinion of the author, I decided to purchase this book. I was shocked to find that he was not a big fan of some of my favorite authors. He seems to have no use for H.P. Lovecraft and Robert E. Howard who I enjoy reading very much. He also doesn't like Tolkien much either. He does back up his opinion with reasons that are well explained and after reading this book, I at least understood why he disliked certain works."
1,Crap!,A book about a person sleeping on friends sofas and working as a stripper. Waste of time reading this book.
1,He was on the take,"Folks, it has been revealed that Peter J. Ferrera was paid by Jack Abramoff to write about his clients, who engendered the ""Choctaw Revolution."""
1,Archives is geared toward a particular style of learning,"The examples in this book are geared for UNIX administrators, limiting its usefulness to other users. Consider this book if you are a UNIX administrator who learns best by looking at code examples, otherwise your time and money are probably best spent on another book. For examples of how to do things - Python Essential Reference is a better book. Archives is not as much a reference as it is a method of learning Python by looking at code examples and explanations of the code."
3,Ubu goes Pop with a Brain,"I first heard this album as a very rigid fan of Trout Mask Replica style avant garde and hated it. Pere Ubu totally goes bland and sells out, I thought. 6 or 7 years later, this album is far better than that. While Ubu could do better (as proven by their next album) Story of my Life keeps a lot of the quirkiness of classic Ubu with a sugary touch to wash it down more easily. If you like the new wave side of Pere Ubu you'll like this album. If you like Fear and Richard Hell, buy the Modern Dance instead."
5,GREAT!,"Great music, good band, beautiful song.I found more info about the band and mp3 at: http://www.zoetheband.com"
2,The Room,"This album of Zoé indeed is not as good as the other albums they have. I do not understand why they made seven different versions of the song ""Dead"". Only the first one and one otherone I like. However, there are other really good songs on this album, and it comes with two videos: one of the song ""Dead"", and another one that León Larregui made. The album is worth to buy."
5,Zoe rocks!!,"i fell in love with this band from the very first time i heard them. i'm referring to rocanlover here and their latest single is HOT!! i just now found zoe on cdnow, they weren't there before so i'm very excited because now i won't have to pay for the outrageous international shipping prices.zoe is a must!!"
5,Also looking for refills. Great Product!,"I have bought this soap (refill size bottle) many times in the past. I can no longer find the product in the refill size. I decided to search the web for it today and I see that there are others looking for the same product. I hope to find it somewhere out here in cyber land. I don't want to purchase the small bottles either. If I do find it, I will post as I hope others will do. I thought I would find it here. I hope Amazon will look into this; it would bring additional revenue for them as well as keeping their customers happy!"
1,CREASES,I ordered this 2 months ago. My weight is 115. My weight could not hold this foam without it creasing. Now it has a huge crease and dent right through the center. It felt so nice and soft at the beginning and I am glad I did not rush to leave a review. Now I am disapppointed.
5,Love it,I have joint problems and arthritis. My mattress was too hard to make moving in bed comfortable. This pad really helped with the comfort level.
3,functional,"This item works fine, but the cut is not really correct for my bed. I have an Eastern King, I think it would be better on a CA king. The cut is also not really very straight along two sides. It is also not as thick a pad as I expected. I think my pad is about two inches thick.I was expecting the consistencey to be more like the Tempurpedic pillow I own. It feels a lot less durable and I do not think it will last as long. I do feel the item is the correct value for what I got and I would prbably order it again because the price is so good."
2,smells terrible,"While this pad does help a very hard mattress feel good, after 3 weeks I can't get rid of the smell. I wonder if it will ever go away.!"
3,check out specifics,"I am going to have to resell this product sinced it is not compatible with my computer. Since I am not very tech oriented, I did not think to check out these things. Buyer beware.It arrived in very good condition although it took forever to get the product from the supplier (over a month) because she said she did not get her notifications because she was on vacation."
3,There was a time...,"There was a time when scene after scene of screaming Italians meant 'art film' and endless depictions of tedious pathology was 'interesting.' Not now. There are standout performances that are timeless, but you should bring a lot of tolerance to this if you plan to enjoy it. Also, there are no extras on the DVD - nothing to help the viewer appreciate why this film was important when it was made, etc."
1,I would not recommend this product,"I would not recommend this puzzle to anyone. Many of the pieces are shaped the same, making it hard to find the correct place for each piece, especially when the pieces are the same color. The pieces are larger than I expected for a 1000 piece puzzle and many weren't cut all the way through, so I had to pull or tear them apart. The box it came in was very flimsy and I had to cut it open myself. I wouldn't have minded the extra work if the puzzle had been worth it. I was very disappointed with this particular puzzle and I don't plan on finishing it. I will also not buy any more from this particular company."
2,Not Relaxing,Will never buy another Jeff Wilkes puzzle unless I have absolutely nothing left in the world to do. All the pieces are the same. I enjoy a challenge but this one was rediculos. Do not recommend to anyone sane.
3,good present,"I purchased this hiking stick for my sister who is an avid hiker. The design is simple, but nice. When I tried to put my weight on it, it looked like it would not hold, but i'm not sure how my sister feels about it. The bottom in rubber, so it might not be very good for digging in it to the ground. Overall, I thought it was pretty descent."
4,Golden Fun : Rumpelstiltskin never made more sense!,"Okay, so we all know the Brothers Grimm had it all wrong; we know there had to be a reason the miller was willing to give up his only daughter. We knew it. Forget the Grimms. Take the Vande Velde Route, ie, the one that makes you laugh as well as making sense.Vande Velde delivers her audience many scrumptous tales of Rumpelstiltskin--all refreshing and unique. Not a one didn't leave me laughing and thoughtful. HOORAY! A Rumpelstiltskin that isn't a ""Problem.""Mix humor, good sense, and a dash of ""strong heroines"" and you've got your ""Rumpelstiltskin Problem."" Only one problem; sometimes a little dragging, but that is easily overlooked. So my advise to you? Pick it up at the library or store as soon as possible! It'll be worth the trip!Happy reading!"
5,You think you know Rumpelstiltskin?,"OK, it a fairy tale and middle school students are too old for such things. But wait, you haven't been pulled into the complexity of the tale and what the ture story is. These six short well crafted stories will draw in the most jaded student."
3,Incredibly Creative and Wonderfully Crafted,"A well crafted, humorous, tongue in cheek, unique spin of the classic Brothers Grimm fairy tale Rumpelstiltskin. There are six variations on the theme of this goblin-like character who helps the miller's daughter spin straw to gold.Some of the tales are so funny that I laughed out loud. All are creative and witty."
2,boring but creative,"The beginning of this book is very interesting and entertaining. The voice of the author in his note is very amusing and makes a clear point. His ability to come up with such different and full versions of the classic story, Rumpelstiltskin, is extremely creative and enjoyable, but gets very dull as the book holds six different versions of the same story that we already know of. The questions that the author throws at the reader is what kept me reading the first half of the book, but had to force myself to read to the end. For the most part, I didn¡t enjoy the book, but some parts were amusing."
2,Read Me!,This book started out hilarious. I luaghed histerically when I read the authors note. then as I read on this book became less and less amusing. It was no longer funny and it soon became boring. I would say that if someone wanted to read this they should read the author's note then put it back on the shelf.
5,Great Nutrition,This bar is packed with healthy ingredients and supplies energy throughout the day due to the whole grains. I would recommend this variety pack to anyone.
3,Clif bars are healthy but they are gross,One of my health nut friends eats these things all the time. I tried substituting one in my daily routine and that got old really quick. I bought two boxes and the second box is not going to get much use I think.Clif does have some good flavors but surprisingly only the walnut ones are good in the variety pack.If you dont care about taste and only care about health these are great!
4,"good exercise food, bad snack","I would never eat these things as a snack when I'm sitting at my desk. They have too many calories and too much sodium. On the other hand, they are a great fuel for endurance sports. A decent breakfast plus one Clif Bar per hour (plus water or Gatorade) is enough fuel to keep me going on an 8 hour bicycle ride. The bars are compact enough to easily slide into my pockets or saddle bag and the calorie and sodium levels are just right for a 1-per-hour refueling schedule. The low fat levels help them digest easily. PowerBars work, too, but I like the taste of Clif bars better."
2,I Don't Get It,"Clif bars are gross. They're fake food. I prefer REAL food and real snacks. I still have my box of these things sitting in my pantry if anyone wants them. They totally disappointed me, though...."
4,taste good - texture a bit undercooked,My husband and I bought these for the low saturated fat content and the good protein to overall fat ratio. He loved the taste and found the slightly undercooked texture to be similar to a gooey cookie middle. I found the taste to be OK but the raw-ish middle was too gooey for me.
4,Great energy source,These bars are an excellent blend of protien and carbs for all of your workout needs. We even have eaten them as a meal. Good taste.
4,Tastey Energy Bar.... Urban Legend? Myth? or Fact!,These are the bomb when it comes to energy snack bars. Just make sure you have something to drink since they tend to be rather chewy and can leave yur mouth a bit dry... but one of these and a liter of water puts me back in shape for a few more hours of activity.
2,Kinda blah,"I liked these when they first came out, cuz there was nothing else ouyt there!. I wish Clif would come out with soemthing exciting... the Buildersbar didnt do the trick. Tastes like gravel."
1,Hardly a sensible choice,"Instead of a Clif peanut butter bar, why not just grab a Reese peanut butter cup? They're just about the same in terms of nutritional value.Think I'm crazy? Listen up. Check out these stats. Reese on the left, Clif Chocolate Chip Peanut Crunch on the right.Calories: 280/250Sodium: 180mg/210mgProtein: 6g/12gSo you say Clif has vitamins? Big deal. Chew a Flintstones in the morning.Add to that the fact that the Clif bar tastes like Richard Simmons' sweaty shorts dunked in bad chocolate, and the choice is clear: Eat Reese Peanut Butter Cups for health. They're just as good for you as Clif bars, and much better tasting."
5,Wonderful!,"This is the TV version of I Dream of Jeannie; there is a ""later release"" by Sony; this release is by Screen Gems; this has ""TV Land"" in the lower part of the screen; both are the same except the Sony release is not the TV version.Excellent job Screen Gems!"
5,ATrue Story on Drug Testing,This is a very interesting and true story on how someone can bewrongfully treated in a world of drug testing. i cant beleive what john and Roger went thru.All the work and hassle to try to prove your innocence.clear your name and get your job back.it is a great book.id advise anyone to read it.Great job John and Roger for all you helped and stood by John and believed in him. Your great guys.Love YARENEE
5,what I needed,Worked great just the part I needed. Order showed up on time and was what they said it was! Nice work!
1,"one works, the other rattles like it's full off rocks","The quality control on these must be terrible. While one worked (for how long, who knows...) the other rattled like it was full of rocks. Not even close to right.Caveat emptor."
2,Don't be fooled,"These are a healthier candy bar, and not a good choice for getting protein. They're loaded with sugars and saturated fats - there's more carbohydrates than proteins in these things. If you're eating a protein bar in order to get protein, in the context of a healthier diet, there's plenty of other bars with equal (or greater) amounts of protein, but with substantially less sugars and fat, that I still think taste fine. As for the taste of these bars - I find them to be something like a medicinal candy bar, and cloyingly sweet. I wouldn't call them bad, but I don't really enjoy the taste either.I couldn't recommend these to people, except for those who absolutely have to eat candy bars from time to time, and want to try something a bit healthier. It might also be good a good snack for a long hike."
3,Strong taste buds,Don't know how well they work but they are not that tasty. and you will have to have strong taste buds to finish 1
3,fits in perfectly,"This is a good product. Very tasty and filling while very protein-packed and no trans-fat. I'm not a ""builder"" but rather a college student on the go. This bar fits in perfectly with my busy school day."
4,Pretty Good Bar,I rely on bars daily for protein. These are tasty but do have a little more sugar than I would like. Overall It is a good bar. Most bars with this amount of protein have an awful aftertaste but these do not.
3,Poor shipment method in warm weather,"The product itself was not an issue. However, I won't be ordering these to be shipped in the summer ever again. They came completely melted. By the time I was opening them up at work during a break, the chocolate was basically all in the bottom of the packages and would get everywhere when I'd open them. I'll only repeat this order in cooler weather. I've been eating Clif Builder's Bars for a couple of years now, and they are truly one of the best tasting protein bars on the market. I stand by the bar, just not the method of shipping chosen in 90+ degree weather."
3,"Clear, concise and informative on Greek Tragedy","On specific works however, needs more analysis to back up its statements, for e.g. in Oedipus Rex, there are some sweeping statements that users need to take into account."
2,"Death: ""wasn't"" The Time of Your Life",This character from the Sandman series is not anywhere as good as the Sandman series. My advice - stick with the Sandman books.
3,I had bagels and hot dogs..,"This is definitely not the best Gaiman work, nor is it even close to the standard of Sandman.While it is quite a good read, it is very quick with little depth, with a completely bizarre introduction from Tori Amos, and the character of Death is not quite the powerhouse woman I imagine from Sandman. Lets not forget the unusual end section regarding unsafe sex..of all things. The graphics are generally below the standard of Sandman, and the supporting cast are very poorly explored.Both she and Sexton are quite cute characters, and her brief offering of life is nice touch. Cute again, even. This is what Death; the cost of living remains...one of the shallower cuter parts of the Sandman. I am suprised Gaiman did not expand the story, it definitely had the potential."
3,"Fantastic art, average writing","You see, it's not that this is a mediocre work - it's definitely above average (hence the 3 out of 5 star rating) - it's just that we've been spoiled silly by the brilliant standard of writing, plotting, philosophy and character that Neil Gaiman so generously gave us through the epic run of his, 'Sandman,' series and when we come across a spin-off graphic novel that doesn't quite live up to that standard, of course we're going to be just a wee bit disappointed. With that being said, if you were a fan of the, 'Sandman,' series then you certainly dug the character of Death, and with that of course you have to read this volume as well. While the artwork is brilliant throughout (almost taking on a japanese manga look at times) the writing, sadly, just isn't quite up to snuff. Still, it's a slim enough book to make breezing through quite an effortless and pleasing experience."
4,Tori,"I think Four-Stars is good. nothing is so incredibly flawless it deserves 100%, but i think that Gaiman is a beautiful writer in his perspective of life. ~Death-time of your life~ is a great book that i envy the possesion of in a friend of mine, along with any other Gaiman written works. Has good humor with deep expression, accompanies good artists work. somebody should smile and all be so simply complicated."
2,A Waste of the Time of Your Life,"It's hard to believe that this came from the mind and hands of Neil Gaiman. There is simply nothing here of any interest. It's been said in other reviews here that this simply suffers from comparison with Neil's better offerings, but I think this would fare poorly no matter who the author was. There is little mood, little characterization beyond obvious cliches, no atmosphere, no build up, no pay off. You will not be changed in any way after reading this, other than to have lost some of the time of your life."
3,Death is oh so cute,"This trade paperback of a cute little girl who is Death is quite amusing. The writing is very sharp. Gaiman is a veteran to telling stories of the non mainstream characters. Is Death so threatening? Why should she ? Gaiman leads the readers to a web of a young girl's journey, full of curiosity and agony as she ""does her job."" The art, needless to say, is average at best. I dislike this type of almost all black-and-white treatment of a comic book. The art is at times sloppy and lazy, in my opinion. But the writing does not slack off. The originality of the story is another question mark. I thought it wasn't anything new. It was Neil Gaiman, yes, but ground breaking and exciting it is not. I think a gamble on this is ok. But don't gamble on this book with your last dollar."
3,Not As Awesome As Death Usually Is,"While the storyline of this book gets a bit convoluted and seems almost tragectory, it covers some jolly-deep topics, which is what makes it worth reading. However, the big disappointment is how poorly drawn and totally peripheral Death is in this particular book. It's like she's merely some goth ornament, which pissed my feminist self off."
2,Not So Hot!,"I saw Wolfgang Puck on TV demonstrating these pans. He said they clean up easily and are great to cook with etc. Well, when I got them and tried to cook with them, everything sticks in them. Because everything sticks, I have to use scouring powder every time to keep clean. When you go to wash the pans, you will end up pouring water on your floor or counter because the water goes down the hollow handle and ends up wherever you're aiming the handles. You must season these pans just like the old cast iron if you don't want stuff to stick and even then......I think you can do better than these pans."
4,Tradeoff: heavy but no eye strain,"I bought this to use in my office as a stand-in PC, so naturally I wanted a large screen. I bought the docking station, which came with a wireless keyboard and mouse. The setup works great for my purposes, and because it's a laptop I can take it home with me. However, at 8.1 pounds it is truly heavy. Carrying the laptop plus a briefcase feels like lugging a heavy load up the Himalayas. Another unanticipated negative: You cannot see the screen when using the laptop outdoors, even under an umbrella. That's a bummer, because before buying it I had visions of working by the pool, umbrella drink by my side."
3,Verdict is still out,"I got this super cheap at Target (i.e., $7.50). It seems cool enough. The audio is loud enough to hear without needing headphones. The picture is a little grainy. Also because the device is see-through, the movement of the disk moving right next the screen is a little visually distracting. (But my son doesn't seem bothered by it.) Lastly, the picture will freeze up sometimes. I wouldn't spend a lot of money on this... but if you can get it cheap I would recommend it."
2,"Got two, one doesn't work","It's Christmas morning. Thank GOODNESS we bought two identical VideoNows for our two boys, as one of them keeps freezing, if it plays the picture it is all snowy. We tried a different brand of batteries to see if that made a difference. I'm not thrilled with the quality - if they all work the way the second one we opened work, then it's a great (hopefully more sturdy) alternative to a standard portable DVD player."
5,Killed By A Poison Dart,Another pre-WWII film by 20th Century-Fox. Charlie is giving a weekly Crime League radio broadcast at the museum when an escaped convict seeks revenge on him for helping to put him in prison. One of Charlie's panelists is mistakenly killed by a poison dart intended for the great detective.Sidney Toler plays Chan while Sen Yung is again cast in the role of Jimmy Chan. The screenplay is by John Larkin and the movie's director is Lynn Shores.CHARLIE CHAN AT THE WAX MUSEUM is one of the best entries in the series.
5,GREAT JOB,"Like new , I can't be happier. You send it to me very quickly. I will enjoy it for manny years. ART"
4,Fun Little Film,"This is another Sydney Toler film with his number two son Jimmy playing the comedy relief. This story was not as good as the others in this series.The number of suspects and the fake radio show was not really that well done.A criminal at a jury gets convicted to the death penalty and steals a gun and shoots his way out of court. He makes his way to a crooked face doctor who has a front as a wax museum curator.The confusion comes when you have pretty much every character acting suspiciously.And the end was not all that interesting except for people mistaking wax dummies for real people or real people posing as wax exhibits.Overall, not a bad entry into the Charlie Chan series."
5,Direct Replacement,"I looked around quite a bit for a replacement for the original screen that was in my shower, but I couldn't find the exact one the contractor that had built my house had used. So I cross-referenced and landed on this one. But, as with all things, it wasn't an exact match, First, it was metal, which mine my plastic, but I didn't think that was a big deal. But the mounts were way different. Mine had a consistant smooth 2 7/8 throat that fit inside the drain pipe fitting where as this had 4 prongs that were 2 7/8 apart. After thinking about it a bit, I figured it probably should work ok. Got the part, slipped it in with a little pressure and it fits quite nicely."
5,Bran revisited,This retelling of the Legend of Bran was really relevant for today. I really enjoyed it.
1,Dog Loved It,We used this on several items and we have two puppies. One loved it and even chewed her crate pillow. Don't waste your money.
3,It was OK read.,"It started off well,but then got slow down in the middle.the author had a great idea in the beginning,then looks like she lost track somewhere.Overall,it was OK read.May be my expectation was too high? i don't know."
1,Wish it had worked,"I had great expectations for the SassyBax, but, alas, they were not met. The product was extremely uncomfortable after about ten minutes of wear. Too high under the arms and the bottom band rolled up. Does anyone make a comfortable bra?"
2,Not enough support!,"Oh how I wanted this to work for me. However, since I have major boobage, I need major support. Somehow I thought the sassybax would offer more support since it has so much coverage. Not so. I sag and jiggle . . . it does serve as a 'round the house bra. This is not a one-size-fits-all solution for those of us with bigger bodies."
3,"Good looks, Not so good airflow","I bought this fan, thinking it would provide god air flow.this fan looks incredible, but i was shocked becuase it was very strong for the size.But, i was also shocked becuase the fan does not put out air at all.Buy for looks"
1,"Understanding, but no helpful solutions","I got half way through ""Love & Betrayal"" by John Amodeo and had to put it down. While the author seems to fully understand how one who has been betrayed feels, he offered no helpful solutions for the problem. I was looking for ways to help deal with what happened to me so I could move forward without hurting my current relationship. After reading chapter after chapter of the same thing over and over again, I finally threw the book away. It's possible that the final chapters have some kind of solution, but I was looking for something positive and encouraging and didn't find that in the first half of the book. Like I said, and much like the book, I repeat, monotonous!"
1,THIS BAND MOCKS RELIGION,"I have to say it, in ""Waste of time"" they don't even have their facts straight in the lyrics. They say that praying is a waste of time, which just isn't true. They are mocking people with religious beliefs. Read the lyrics and you'll see what I mean.That, for me spoilt an otherwise okay album.Musically it's rocks, lyrically it fails"
2,Old man falls for young chick,"Second rate movie with a third rate plot. Ford is beginning to show his age. To make matters worse -- Heche's character is totally uninteresting; a real airhead. Now why would a middle-aged man, who supposedly is wordly, go for a young woman, who between the ears is nothing more than a wind tunnel? How much more entertaining and intriquing this movie could have been if the woman's part was played by someone closer to Ford's age and sophistication! It would have given Ford's character a run for his money, and we would really see the sparks fly. (Ah yes, but this is Hollywood -- no guts, and always choose the easy way out). The pirates were a bit much. Could have been a good flick, but got wasted away -- as usual."
5,6 days 7 nighs dvd,I was glad to find one of my all time favorite movies on Amazon. I hope they continue to keep items like this available.
1,Terrible,"Warning -- Watching this movie may be hazardous to your intellect. While I appreciate that Amazon is in the business of selling movies and would probably rather see reviews accentuating the positive, I would urge you to buy just about any other movie Amazon offers before you consider this one. With the exception of a couple mildly amusing exchanges, the movie is without any redeeming qualities. Even the usually dependable Ford fails to save this one from the garbage heap. The plot is ridiculous, utterly implausible, and insulting to one's intelligence. I wouldn't waste my own time or money, and I urge you not to waste yours."
1,Stay away from this one!,This is NOT one of Harrison Ford's best films. I feel that he lowered himself to take this role. No way can this film be compared to Patriot Games or Clear and Present Danger as far as one of Harrison Ford's great films. This show was so stupid that it was very sad to associate such a great actor as Harrison Ford with this waste of film. It doesn't suprise me with Ann Heche in this film. A poor actress for a poor film. Don't waste your money or time on this film.
1,Poor Acting,"If you like ""Soup of the Soul"" type books, you might like this movie. Otherwise, stay away. The acting is second rate and it's obvious Anne Heche is struggling in the romantic scenes to be something she is not. The only good part of the moive was Ford and his airplane."
1,Harrison Ford can do a LOT better than this!,"I expected a fun flick, but was very disappointed. It was terribly boring, and I actually had trouble staying awake. Not one I'd recommend to anyone."
1,Wide Screen Version Dang it!,When I bought this DVD it did not state on the description that it was a wide screen version yet when it arrived that's what it was. I prefer full screen versions of movies and do not buy wide screen versions. The DVD's advertized on Amazon should state clearly if they are widescreen versions or not.
1,Wish I could give it a zero.,The only good point about this movie was Anne Heche was in a wet t-shirt for about half of it. Totally predictable. The best laughs were in the trailer.
1,sucked!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"it was the biggest waste of my time. it was one of the worst movies i've seen. my advice to everyone is don't buy it, you will hate it."
1,Caveat emptor,"There's a storm, an aircraft forced-landing ( and Harry of course is in it ), a deserted island ( well, at least it's not a treasury island ), waterfalls and, oh yes, of course ( how could they not be there? ) there are some pirates too, and they're really mean...a typical Harry Ford movie...oh no, I almost forgot, there are no extra terrestrals in this one!"
1,This movie is CRAP!,"What a huge disappointment. I have this movie on VHS. WAtched it once. I want to use it for target practice. Then I bought a DVD player and got it for free. Its still in the plastic. I could never watch this movie again. Anybody want it? Its free!The jokes were almost as bad as the story. Come on?? Crash on a desery island and have to survive? Gee, thats a new concept. Oh and the pirates! Who has pirates nowadays?!Heres a scary the scary thing. I am a huge fan of Harrison Ford. I'll say it again, what a disappointment. This was his worst movie. This was the worst movie since Babe! I give it negative 1 star."
2,Just another trite and sappy romantic comedy,"Note to producers: For God's sake, if you're gonna make a movie about being stranded on a deserted island, don't film it on Kauai. The idea that a large and utterly gorgeous island like Kauai could be deserted removes any semblance of credibility your movie could have had."
3,Six Days Seven Nights,"""Six Days Seven Nights"" I like Harrison Ford, but the acting needs work. I like aviation romances. I enjoyed the aviation scenes, being an aircraft mechanic. I would recommend it to other viewers."
2,I don't regret seeing it,I would say this is a fine movie to watch while you're falling asleep. The plot was blunt and required no real ability to think. I was impressed by the beautiful scenery and got a cheap laugh at the character's facial expressions.. I questioned Robin's ability to remain so beautiful and hairless while spending the better part of a week in the wilderness. I love Harrison Ford but this wasn't one of his films to brag about. This movie was simply entertaining if not captivating.
4,When Harry Met Anne,"I like a Romantic Comedy that doesn't take itself too seriously. That is one of the reasons I enjoy viewing ""Six Days And Seven Nights,"" with Harrison Ford and Anne Heche. Besides these two actors being amoung my very favourites, I was totally caught up in the old-fashioned approach used in the making of this captivating film. The dialogue was hilarious, enhanced by the skills of all involved. Each person contibuted to the success of ""Six Days and Seven Nights,"" and by success I mean the ability to make a movie that causes intense laughter every time you see it, even if you view it in succession. The only thing I would wish for would be to have had it been a longer film. Stereotypes not withstanding, it is always a joy to behold When Harry Met Anne, Et Al."
5,A lot of movie scenes in one movie,"This movie is a hoot and a lot of fun. Best part is all of the scenes stolen from other movies, the kissing on the beach from From Here to Eternity, the jumping off the cliff from Butch Cassidy and The Sundance Kid, and the pulling the pontoons down the river with Harrison Ford pulling on the floats like Bogart did in The African Queen."
3,The cinematography was gorgeous on DVD,"If you haven't been on a vacation to a tropical island, this dvd will make you want to book a flight. The color of the sunset and beaches was awesome. I couldn't understand why they had to throw in some pirates (Maybe if this was fantasy island). There could have been other ways to add more intensity. Maybe have Harrison break his leg from a fall or something or maybe a volcanic eruption."
4,Extremely Funny and Uplifting. Harrison Ford is excellent!,"I thought this movie was great! and so under-rated by the critics. It was extremely funny and again, shows the complete versatility of Harrrison Ford to be able to play both dramatic and comedic roles extremely well. Bravo and I advise everyone who wants a laugh to see this movie."
3,"Cute, fluffy, predictable movie.","I did enjoy this movie, however I am a big Harrison Ford fan. It reminds me of an old fashion style of movie. The bantor between Ford and Heche is cute. Reminds me of Sabrina but I thought Sabrina was a little better."
5,Each Viewing brings Six Days Seven Night Worth of,"This has been one of my favorite movies for quite awhile. Not only does it show Harrison Ford's talent with comedy, but also how he and Ann Heche worked so well together, and it seemed like there was no script and that they were just reacting to one another. David Schwimmer is forever terrific and I was surprised at Jaqueline Obradors, whom I recall from NYPD Blue...WOW! My only complaint was that the picture didn't fill up my screen, as it was just about 12 inches tall and 24 inches wide, and the sound volume was not very loud, even though I had it jacked at high as it would go! I have NO complaints with the seller at all and they deserve a 5 wtar rating, as well. Except for some pretty explicit swearing, which, added NOTHING to the quality of the movie, and use of tamer adjectives would have sufficed, I really love this movie!!"
4,Great Movie,My husband and I liked this movie. We are big Harrison Ford fans.I would recommend this movie to anyone!
3,never really comes together,"I wanted to like this movie alot...and I guess I did enjoy it somewhat. Unfortunately the cute, if somewhat simplistic and over used, plot of this film could have used a rewrite, as well as different cast. Ford does a decent job, though this is hardly a role he will be remembered for. But there is absolutely no...none...zippppppppppppppppo chemistry between him and Anne Heche. In the end the movie feels kind of rushed as if large gabs of the film might have been left on the cutting room floor. Nothing that happens in this movie leads me to actually believe that Anne and Harrision have had the time to fall in love. Though as I already stated, there is no chemistry between them anyway."
3,An Enjoyable Movie,"I didn't know what to expect in this comedy starring Harrison Ford and Anne Heche. I was pleasantly surprised though, and some scenes had me rolling. The video transfer is good and the sound is nice. Overall an enjoyable movie to rent, but I wouldn't recommend purchasing this DVD because there just isn't enough to keep you coming back. Lets see, we get some trailers, and...not much else. Bottom line: not worth purchasing."
2,Nice shots of Kauai's NaPali Coast but...,"that alone didn't hold this movie together. Pathetic love story, shallow story, even more shallow characters, and action scenes consisted of ""Keystone Cops"" meet the ""Pirates of Penzance"". But maybe that is what the director intended. If you must buy/rent this movie (not film) keep it on a 21"" screen or smaller."
5,"A BEST ""aviation movie""","For me, this is one of those wonderful aviation movies such as ""Airplane"". I expect that it may not be a ""great"" movie BUT it IS ""great"" fun. I have found that there are several individual scenes that just become a joy to review and share with others. (I am a pilot of general aviation aircraft and may be a bit prejudiced with my viewpoint.)"
3,Easy to watch!,"Just the thing for a lazy Sunday afternoon when you don't want to concentrate too much. It is light, entertaining and quite funny. Nobody smiles like Harrison Ford! My guess is he made this movie for the fun of it because it is not up to his usual standard. This is the first time I saw Anne Heche in a movie and well ... she is nothing extraordinary."
4,Flaws in the Movie:,"Well, they could've just glued it back together! He had glue in his pocket (you see when he boards the plane, it says ""Elmer's School Glue""). So, he wasn't being sarchastic when he said ""Sure, we can just, like, glue it back together!"". He meant it, but the script prevented him from doing so."
4,"If you're looking for light, romantic comedy, this is it!","I really liked this film! Harrison Ford still looks great, and he could be playful in ways his other roles haven't allowed. There is definitely chemistry between Anne Heche and Ford. So it wasn't The Fugitive or Patriot Games--this is a perfect film for those interested in light, romantic comedy along the lines of Romancing the Stone, African Queen, and so many others. I think some critics were unfairly harsh toward this film. I still recommend it!"
2,Lacks focus,"Ann Heche and Harrison Ford are stranded on a remote island when their plane is struck by lightening. Beginning as antagonist, they eventually fall in love as they attempt to get home. The movie does contain some extremely funny scenes and Harrison Ford, as always, is excellent, but Ann Heche's off screen public homosexuality made her portrayal of an young woman falling for a much older man unbelievable. Contrary to Hollywood's attempt to normalized the relationship between the two, Heche's infatuation with a man old enough to be her father comes across as foolish and Ford's willingness to accept that infatuation, as predatory. The remainder of the story line contained so many useless subplots (pirates, Heche's fiancee's sleeping with another woman while trying to find her, etc.) that the primary plot is lost as the story flow is interrupted over and over again. The end of the movie comes as more of a relief than a conclusion."
2,A FOUR STAR AVERAGE RATING!?!?!,"PEOPLE! Get a grip! There are only five stars! This was an okay flick, not a bad time waster, but is it really 80% of the movie that, say, Taxi Driver or One Flew Over the Cuckoo's nest are? Does anybody trouble him (her) self to think before entering the star rating? Amazon should make 1 star the default and have people work up from there. Like 6 people think this is 100% of what a movie should be! The mind boggles. Too many kids online maybe."
2,wonderful until they shatter,"These are for the most part, magnificent wine glasses. Notice I said for the most part. The problems stem not from the experience of drinking the wine, but from what happens afterwards. It seems as if anything-- and I do mean anything-- can and will shatter these fragile glasses. They have broken in the dishwasher; broken when washing by hand (as gently as if I were washing a baby's bottom); broken when being tucked away for the night; broken even when glanced at (though it was with some degree of malice). And this state of fragility is not limited to the cabernet glasses, or, as I refer to them - the brunello glasses. It happens with an equal frequency to the barolo, chianti, and even the meek and diminutive pinot grigio size.If you enjoy drinking wine, and don't mind stocking a garage full of wine glasses, then please click the button to purchase these. They are fine glasses while they last.Jim Giammatteo"
4,Great Design and perfect Crystal,These are the best Wine Glasses. the Quality its outstanding; perfect for any kind of cabernet or red wine.
2,great product; damaged,"I ordered 8 Riedel Vinum Bordeaux glasses. 2 of the first four were chipped. I returned them and was sent replacements. One arrived with the stem broken. In checking with a local store, I saved only the tax and would have had less trouble and perfect condition glasses.The glasses themselves are great."
4,good weird fun,"As another reviewer so correctly pointed out, this is adult humor. Pee Wee should never have gone into children's television. He's much better when he's satirizing it. I wish this were available on DVD. I got this video largely for reasons of nostalgia, but it still holds up."
5,Pee-Wee Herman,This is an original before Pee-Wee's Playhouse & the movies.It has all the classic characters & gags is still makes me laugh when I firstsaw it on HBO.Not exactly for the kiddies but not vulgar adult humor.
5,classic humor,I didn't buy this dvd on Amazon but I have had it for a while. It is a funny adult live presentation of Pee-Wee. It is what started it all. If you have a funny bone you'll love this.
5,Brings me back to my childhood...,I remember watching this so much when I was younger..I love the part where the two people who are BBQ'ing start singing!!!
5,Silly fun,"I have watched this video many times over the past 10 years and the silliness still holds up. This origianl show first broadcast on HBO around 1991 is original and worth a watch. It is unfortunate that it is only available on VHS, DVD would do the production far more justice."
4,Classic Pee-Wee,"This is where the character blossomed, this show preceded the hit TV series, and still stands on it's own.Pee-Wee in all his great spoiled, devilish, wonderful glory and Phil Hartman as Captain Carl.I loved it, and felt it was original back when I first saw it on HBO, and if you are a fan of Pee-Wee, I'll be surprised if you don't love this on stage performance, with him and his zany cast of characters. Mecha Leceha Hinee Hoo!!Long Live Jambi!!!"
3,Not Accurate,"The description is wrong, these are the flavors that I got: Orange (12), Cherry Passion(12), Wintergreen(6), Spearmint (6).Looks exactly like thisTic Tac Variety Pack (Orange, Cherry Passion, Wintergreen, Spearmint) - 36ctI'm not exactly fond of Cherry Passion and would've preferred trying the two other flavors instead, however, they did come at a good price."
4,Fascinating slice of history,"Bizarre, fun, weird, historical, slice-of-life, walk back in time.....all describe this film. Even the sound and film editing is bizarre, but in an artsy fartsy way, it pulls you in for the ride. I liked it, felt like I was given an opportunity to step back in time. Wow, how so much has changed and, at the same time, so little has changed."
3,First of the three Morrisey/Warhol/Dallesandro movies,Great start to the trilogy. If your a Warhol or Dallesandro fan you must start here. Acting is not great but being a fan of Warhol & that era it is great to see all the people I've read about.
4,Flesh,Joe Delesandro is great in this Andy Warhol movie. I watch it over and over. Not your ordinary theater movie.
2,"Naked Flesh Is The Only Good Thing About ""Flesh""","Let me make it simple. Whenever the beautiful lead actor Joe Dallesandro is naked onscreen, ""Flesh"" is great. However, whenever Dallesandro is clothed, ""Flesh"" is boring. Now, wasn't this the best review ever?"
2,For Joe Dallesandro fans only,"If you are looking for a good story and character development, this movie dissapoints. The story is rather thin and slow with more focus on Joe's good looks. A irritatating aspect of the DVD was white flashes occuring at innapropriate moments during the movie."
1,Anthropological artifacts,"Without wanting to sound like Bob Dylan's Thin Man, I have to say that the movies in this collection are nothing more than anthropological artifacts, amusing in parts, but crude and technically deficient. The acting, if it qualifies as acting, portrays a gallery of marginalized outcasts in the main, just letting it all hang out for the cameras. Their performances are stiff and flat, and lacking emotional depth. You get exhausted watching Joe Dallesandro lounging about in the nick while other characters squabble about their dysfunctional relationships. It's an aimless meander from one bazaar scene to the next, amid a parade of weird white people, peeling off their clothes at the drop of a hat and indulging in exhibitionism, voyeurism, and trainspotting. In some respects, it's Jerry Springer without the audience and Jerry, but a little less restrained. If you like inarticulate weirdness, this collection is for you."
1,The single worst piece of crap I have ever seen.,"This is the worst movie I have ever seen. It isn't the gay sexuality, I have no problem with that kind of content. But the acting, the editing, the dialog were all terrible. I am even a fan of Patti D'Arbanville, and I still hated it. I watched the whole thing thinking that the characteristics that the people who gave it a 5 star rating would arrive, but they didn't. I feel cheated even though it was free. I wasted an hour and a half on this."
4,SIMPLY BEAUTIFUL,"The movie as well as the hunk are beautiful! I fell in love with Joe as soon as I saw his body that no other guy can compete with.The story is very good. Sensitive, fragile and desperate. We do not loose any minute with this film as Joe keep us under his spell all the way."
1,Horrible,The suspenders were terrible. The clip on the end is broke. I never got to wear the things! I was gonna send them back but for ten bucks... thats how much it would cost to ship it back. Not worth it in my opinion.
2,Dated opinions make for a irritating read,"I was excited to purchase this book. I was expecting timely words and insights on the importance of farmers and small local markets. And don't get me wrong, that was there, but peppered throughout his book of opinions (I mean observations), were dated, aged comments about youth (such as I)and the popula culture of today. I felt mis-understood, and could only relate as a I do to my mother. (Yeah, I know mom, I know...)Very dissapointing.I wish I could return the book."
5,A Powerful Book-Read it NOW,Michael Madison addresses many the issues facing us today as humans while he navigates the farm and farmers markets. Could be the (god forbid) new Peter Mayles of the United States and turns the area he is from a new tourist destination! I certainly want to run to his farmers market. Blithe Tomato took me out of my life for a day!!!Loved it!!
5,Shock and Awe,"I was frankly astonished to read an Oscar Wilde children's story and find that it promotes a rather traditional ""moral."" Knowing him from his very witty, sometimes risque plays, I wasn't sure what to expect, but not this.What you get is still witty -- just because it's for kids doesn't mean Wilde has lost his sense of the ridiculous -- but also providing a simple, moving lesson on what it means to be compassionate and giving. I think what works best here is that Wilde never talks down to his readers. He assumes that they're young, not stupid, and I find that refreshing.The title story ""The Happy Prince"" is deservedly the most well-known, but all of the tales contained here work in a similar way -- a traditional ""lesson"" to be learned, but told in a charming voice with a touch of humor and a tug at the heartstrings."
2,Same old story,"I bought this book because of the RITA award and excellent reader reviews. I was so surprised to find it completely predictable and trite. I don't mind if Romance novels follow the same worn plot - in fact, their very predictability is comforting. I do mind if they lack any originality, however. I found the conversation dull and unrealistic. There was no spark of passion. I did not understand the motivations for the characters at all. They were so weighted down with pathos and past injuries that I could barely keep myself turning the pages. My favorite regency romance is Whitney My Love - the same old plot but with humor and complex character development."
1,Unreal even for a romance novel,"It began well enough, but from the middle to the last page it went frankly boring. The only part I really laughed through was when Adrian was telling Leah his sad,sad,sad story about how cruel was his father and how heartless was Charlotte... Although as I'm reading all the good reviews I'm not so sure if I read the same book as them. Maybe mine has all the good parts missing..."
1,"""Merely Unreal"" even for a romance novel","It began well enough, but from the middle to the last page it went frankly boring. The only part I really laughed through was when Adrian was telling Leah his sad,sad,sad story about how cruel was his father and how heartless was Charlotte (the pages whisper ""clichè...! clichè..!""), although as I'm reading all the good reviews I'm not so sure if I read the same book as them. Maybe mine has all the good parts missing...; )"
4,A fresh take on an old story,"Readers of romance novels have all seen the plot of this book before - two people who loathe each other are forced to marry and end up falling in love. Ms. Coughlin updates this plot by giving us wonderful, well-written, likable characters and sparkling dialog. I loved the way Adrian and Leah verbally dueled, and the way that they gradually developed respect, and then love for each other. The love scenes were great, too! I especially liked the way the author avoided endowing the hero or heroine with the unrealistic attributes that some romance authors do to their leads. There were no surprises in the story - I knew exactly where this book was going, but really enjoyed the journey!"
4,Very Funny and a True Delight to Read,"Leah was traveling to London to prepare a house so that she could launch her sister into society and make a great match. On the way she becomes sick and is expected to die. Along comes Adrian, the Duke of Raven, he is so obsessed with on marrying and being tied down to a woman that he thinks marrying Leah and the playing the grieving widower will keep him out of the ""marraige mart and the matchmaking mamas"". Little does he know that Leah is destined not to die and thus begins the very funny tale of Leah and Adrian. Leah is such a strong character that stands up to Adrian when she wants something. She is very good at adapting to her surroundings and making the best of any situtation. I thought that when Adrian tried to suduce Leah in the artist studio was so funny. But then when he broke her heart, I didn't think anyone could be that cruel. Through it all Leah bears every situtation with quiet self-assurance and proves that love can win in the end."
4,Intriguing,"There were many, many things I liked about this book. Leah wasone of the great, wonderful heroines who took on the devil and won. Iloved her spunk and devotion to her sister.However, I had some problems with Raven. In my opinion it started off bad that he would even think to marry a woman dying without her consent. Leah handled it very well, but it put me off him and he never quite recovered.I found his motivations weak and unbelievable. When he ""exposed"" his past to her, I wanted to shout--could you stop snivling and grow up. He just seemed like a spoiled baby to me.In spite of that, though, I really did like the book and have recommended it to several other people. It was a nice effort and I'll definitely read Ms. Coughlin again."
5,A most enjoyable read!,"I highly recommend this book to anyone. It's a wonderful book which kept me laughing all the way through (ok, except near the ending). I finished it in an afternoon and looking forward to re-reading it again. The dialogues are witty and really funny and they don't depend on the stupideness of the naive/innocent heroine to make the reader laugh. Instead, Leah is a very clever woman and Adrian is wonderful. The story goes on without delay, without 10-pages dialogues, and with great humor. A very nice, entertaining book for anyone to read which will lighten up your day!"
4,Murder Mystery with Sci-Fi Addons,"I bought this book after hearing about it on Instapundit. If you can picture an Islamic New Orleans French Quarter set in the year 2400, you've got the setting for the book.In this setting a man is hired to find a missing person. Almost immediately there's a murder, and the story goes to double-crossing, violence, more murder, and a surprising end.There's a bit of sci-fi here, in a ""Matrix"" ""I know Kung Fu"" way, but it's almost incidental to the rest of the plot. It was the skullduggery that held my attention.The book was a decent read. Given that I got it second-hand (in excellent condition) for a couple of bucks, it was well worth it."
2,Kind of interesting but gets old,The setting is kind of unique and the main character is somewhat interesting but the story kind of drags. Plot development isn't helped by the often innane dialogue. It was interesting enough to finish but I really wouldn't recommend this book (unless you're just a hardcore Cyberpunk fanatic).Not recommended.
3,"Nasty, dark cyberpunk","If you always wanted to read about cyborg transsexual prostitutes getting brutally murdered in post-future Beirut this is the book for you. The book is entertaining and a quick read, but not especially well written. The characterizations are consistent, if flat. The subject matter is really ugly. Most of the characters are totally amoral, and those that aren't are too high to care for the most part. As far as cyberpunk goes this book adds nothing original. It's an entertaining detective genre novel in a cyberpunk setting."
3,"Good, but not great","Fans of old school cyberpunk fiction will probably like this book, but at times it feels like a pale comparison to Gibson's Neuromancer. Both novels feature a drug addicted anti-hero who gets cybernetic implants in order to do a dangerous job, but the protagonist in ""When Gravity Fails"" just doesn't come off as likable as in Neuromancer. Most of the novel plods along as the protagonist tries to avoid things.The setting is very realistic and the description of the world-changing tech is very realistic, but the pace is too slow at first. It picks up almost too quickly at the end, leaving the reader to wonder what took so long."
5,"The best big band in the world, no doubt about it.","When I first heard the band I thought the songs where, a little unusual. That lasted about three minutes. Ever since I've been hooked, and this is the best album yet. Anyone who likes jazz should buy this CD."
4,"branded, starring Alan Ladd","this is a great movie. For a Westerm, there is little r no ""dying "" scenes. good story line. anyone with a western collection should include this movie!"
2,Excessively negative on the space program and astronauts,"This is more a story of embellished government incompetence and mud slinging toward brave men and women who fly into space. While the book is interesting enough to finish, it leaves you with a sense that Burroughs had to stick to the rumors and gossip to make this book fly. It was dissapointing in how few facts or science were cited."
5,Astronaut verified,I met an astronaut who had gone up on Space Shuttle missions if all that stuff in 'Dragonfly' was true. He looked a bit serious and nodded his head and quietly said 'pretty much.'NASA's PR machine probably doesn't like 'Dragonfly' as it doesn't paint a pretty picture often times. It's a great read and I blazed though it.
5,Thrilling Look at the NASA - MIR Program,"This book is an excellent look at life on board an aging space station. The author does an amazing job conveying all the problems on board including the relationship between the cosmonauts as well as the problems with TSUp (the Russian ""mission control""). What also makes the book even more exciting are the transcripts of the communication between the cosmonauts and the ground team in Russia. We really get a sense of actually being in the station and going through the chaos along with the cosmonauts. One of the best accounts of life on board a space station. Highly recommended."
4,A facinating insight to Mir and Russian space procedures,This book is a great insight into the Russian Space agency and realy sheds light on the proceces and people. This is a great book because in reading it you can put in context the present actions in space
4,Read as a cautionary tale...,"Burrough does a great job of explaining most of the political, scientific and technical issues behind the crisis on Mir during 1997. It's a pretty balanced, yet engrossing account of the mistakes, blame-shifting and corner-cutting that characterises the world's combined space programs in the late 1990s. It's sobering to realise that you can imagine just about all of the same problems and issues surfacing in virtually *any* industry that deals with intricate complicated technology, logistics, and large quantities of money that have a impact on people's lives (the airline industry and Y2K spring to mind). The fact that it's set 400 kilometers above the Earth is almost incidental."
4,Organized religion has plenty of problems,The assessment of the quirky aspects of Mormonism is revealing. But all organized religions have their weird aspects and sects.
2,My Son and his Dog Broke it!!!!!,"When I just bought this toy for my son,he played with his dog and he tripped on it.The posts droke and the ropes ripped.After that I gave him a beating and smashed the ring on his head."
3,A MUST WITH THE ACTION FIGURES.,"If you get the WWE action figures, you must get this ring. My sons love using their WWE action figures on this ring and they think it is soo cool that the ring bounces just like the real one."
3,Good price for Ring,"I bought this ring used and it came with seven used action figures. It was in decent condition. It doesn't look as neat as in the picture because, even if you buy it new, the only way to attach the ropes is to tie them and the knots are visible. My son doesn't have any complaints about the knots. But, the ring also comes with surrounding pieces that resemble the mats on the outside of the ring and those do not work at all. The company should re-design them to make them fit better to stay without constantly coming unattached. Other than that, it was a good price for the ring. I would not have purchased a new one at the current new price listings."
5,stunt action ring,"this ring is the best that jakkspacific has ever made. when the figures hit the mat, the mat as a whole bounces. it is smaller than the hardcore action ring. the box says that it works with the wwe ring gear. these are the things that it does NOT work with. the ring skirts don't work neither does the rage in the cage. the tunbuckles work, but raise the ropes up about half an inch. i got the ring after it was shown at a toy fair in new york a while ago, so i have had it for a while. i got it even before it hit stores. it has held up. it is very durable compared to other rings and toys. it is a little hard to put together, now dont get me wrong, it didnt take an hour, it only took about 15 min.. i totally reconmend this toy."
3,"Ring ""Ropes"" Are Not As Shown","Be advised that the ring ropes will not look like the photos here.The ropes have to be threaded through the ""turnbuckles"" then tied in a knot to complete the ring.So, you'll have three big ugly knots in the ropes. There is no way to hide them. All you can do is maybe slide them close to the ""turnbuckles""."
3,There are better playsets...,"If your children (or maybe you adults) are looking for a wrestling ring to play with their action figures in, this is not the best one to buy. The ring itself is pretty thick and durable. The turnbuckles will break if you tie the ropes too tight. Another problem is that the ring is smaller than other rings and isn't proportional with normal 6 inch action figures.The gimmick for the playset is that the ring mat was supposed to bounce when your action figures hit it. This is not the case with this set. The mat does move up and down, but has barely any bounce to it at all. Most action figures just weigh too much for any bounce to occur.There are much better playsets out there. This one is too small and a takes a bit more time to assembly with less payoff. The fact that it is one of the more durable ring sets is what gives this one three stars."
3,this ring isnt great,when i got the ring i was so happy i couldn't believe it i built it as fast as i could after a month i didnt like it it was to small and i got like two in a month and they both broke i would recommend the big one the official scale but if you can't afford it then get this ring.
3,"Does it's job, but cheap quality","I use this tape measure to measure out a football field. It does it's job, and it was great for the first 3-4 hours. Then the handle broke off. So now I'm left having to turn the axis with no handle when wanting to reel in the tape. I'm still currently using the measuring tape and other than the handle breaking off, it's a good."
5,"Must read Robert Rostand thriller,","If you like thrillers, hard-edged, full of political intrigue and fast moving, ""The Killer Elite"" and brash hero Mike Locken may be your kind of stuff. A really good read."
5,MGM at its best!,"If you want to know about Hollywood splendor... this is your movie. The ""golden age of the movies"" greatest studio was the MGM and Mr. Mayer and company put all the best in this brilliant adaptation of Vicki Baum novel. I love every frame of it. The art deco, the music, the stars... Oh, my God! This is cinema! The cast is superb. The Barrymore brothers, the little Crawford (then), the great Beery. And Lewis Stone, what a kind of gentleman and good actor. And Garbo, of course. When she is sad, you are sad. When she is happy, you are happy. And when she said: ""The sun!"". Is summer for us."
5,DVD Grand Hotel,Our grandson appeared in a local production of Grand Hotel. He was so pleased to receive the DVD with the original cast. Arrived promptly and in perfect condtion.
3,Not that Great....,"The movie is relentlessly grim, even in it's lighter moments. Garbo and John Barrymore's hammy scenes together are embarrassing.But John is really endearing in his scenes with brother Lionel Barrymore. Also, Joan Crawford (!) gives the most understated and brilliant performance of the entire cast.Worth a look, but as a whole is a little heavy-handed."
2,Bizarre,"I've seen this movie several times, and have always hated it. I don't know why - I love old movies, but I find this one impossible. Garbo is simply bad - incredible histrionics and inexplicable gyrations and shakes of the shoulders which I'm sure were meant to demonstrate her character as a ballerina, but which look only odd to the modern viewer. The whole film is stilted and shallow. The only other ""classic film"" I've ever come away from feeling shafted by was ""Mrs. Miniver"" for, I think, similar reasons. I think the modern viewer is simply incapable of viewing these movies in the spirit in which they were intended."
5,"this is joy, definitely watch it","definitely worth watching. all these people emerging from the decadence of 1910s and avant-garde of 20s thus bringing a charming mix of mannerism and crude realism. Joan Crawford's shoulders move should be taught in acting schools (do they already?). and damn, can Garbo take on camera! nowdays they cannot last more than 5 seconds of closeup without their faces desolving until they all start resembling one giant boring motionless face of Keanu Reeves doing ""no spoon""."
4,1932 oldie,"If i get a chance to see a movie from this era,i like to have a look at them probably for nostalgic reasons.This movie was very well made and the acting quite good.But i thought it lacked a good plot.I struggled to follow this movie going in and out of thinking about other things,and then saying to myself it's a bit boring.I just couldn't get into it for the most part.There was a murder towards the end and i started following it a bit then."
2,The Kings did way more.,"I was a bit dissapointed with this book. There is so much that could be said about Saul, David and Absolom that book just didn't even try to break the surface."
1,a tale of three kings,"save your money, was not what i expected. i will stick with the Bible's view.threw the book away....a waste of money."
3,Serendipity?,"An interesting little tome I stole from the ladies' room at work. Well, it had been there, neglected, for months. I read it and 4 months later its still hiding in the cabinet. It tries to explain the complexities of God's will, and how one day, it may be His will that you lovingly nurture your fellow man, and another, He may will that you provide tough love to help another achieve. One never knows which role one plays at any given time, and one role has no more value than the other. In this way, its much like Nietsche's ""Beyond Good & Evil"". The flawed perception of the human animal can never fully interpret the ""Why?"""
1,a tale of three kings,whats going on there was not one word of this book jn the sample nice kathy elliott
2,A book that isn't helpful,"A friend recommended ""A Tale of Three Kings"" to me and I liked it, but it really doesn't make any practical suggestions as to how to deal with the issues it talks about in regards to leadership. It was ""nice"" but not helpful."
4,A profound look into the purpose of why Christians suffer,"A Tale Of Three Kings is a an awesome piece of Christian literature. If you are tired of all the ""holy spirit, healing, prosperity, achieving wealth through biblical principles"" type books, than Gene Edwards is your man. In this book, Gene lays out a refreshing perspective on brokeness that is not quite traditional in mainstream ""Sunday school, pulpit preachings"". Through his wonderful and simplistic story telling style, Gene goes into the depths of the hearts of three kings, namely King Saul, King David, and King Absolom. Not only will this book aid in your journey towards the deep things of the Lord and His ways, but it will cause us to look into our very hearts and ask the question, ""which heart of these Kings do I have....."" Indeed men fix things that break, but after we read this book we emerge w/ the understanding that God breaks men to fix them."
1,Phrases not scripturally founded.,"I thought the book was laden with writings that were not found in the scriptures. The premise seems enlightening, but is it worth reading if an author does not base his fiction on the truth of the word in the Bible? Does the end, justify the means?"
4,A Tale of three Kings: A Study in Brokenness,"Fantastic book, everyone should read this book. An excellent and creative view of David and His approach to God's word to him, both as a King and Leader.An attitude worth making your own. Thanks to the writer for giving us yet another way of looking at life and other things with a different outlook."
4,The Tale Told,I have not had an opportunity to read this book yet but the person that recommended it was very impressed. She said anyone that has been hurt by those you value this is the book for you. Most often those that hurt you are love ones or those that you value as a friend. This book will put it back into perspective for you and direct your focus on the problem and not the person. You can continue to love through your hurt.
4,"Enjoyable, Insightful, and Readable.","A fun fictional story/narrative representation that gives a perspective of a Biblical theme. It is specifically about Saul, David, and Absalom who are three kings in early Isreal. The story line investigates the themes of brokenness (especially), but also leadership, authority, and humility.It helps to have a framework understanding of the Davidic Monarchy and the basic character sketches of the kings prior to reading; but regardless is enjoyable insightful and readable. I have read it a couple times because I think that the author captures and embodies in his work some excellent characteristics of life and living."
4,another Edwards classic,"I have given this book to some Christian friends struggling with issues of submission and forgiveness. Some have thanked me, some have not understood or rejected its message. In my experience, those who cannot face the challenges God seems to be bringing them and refuse to see another way than the ""easy life"" that we Americans sometimes worship cannot read this book without anger. Those who prefer to go where God is taking them, rather than holding tightly to the reins of their lives, will be uplifted and transcended by the radical ideas Mr. Edwards always proposes. The same earth-shaking ideas Jesus illustrated many times, I believe. This is not a thorough dissecting of the life of King David, but an insight into things the depthless name-it-and-claim-it prosperity crowd will never understand."
5,Shedding Light in hidden areas,"This is an easy read for anyone. The book will make you read it twice and each time you will find another area to reflect on your own life. It's amazing how the book helped reveal areas that I hadn't uncovered in my own life. This book based on the word of God, shed light on those areas and now God can and is changing them.I hope you will read this book and find things in your life that you didn't know were there and expose them for the sake of positive growth taking place.If you are someone that says I have hit a plateau in my Christian walk and there is no room to grow try reading this book. You will be glad you did."
5,Excellent book,This book was referred to me by my pastor and he recommended for us to purchase it. I am so glad that I did. I skimmed through it the first go round but ended up reading it again at a slower pace. I really received the message in this book for myself and the situation I was going through. Truly this is an excellent book and I highly recommend it for those that have been wounded by leadership.
5,A Tale of Three Kings,"What an awesome book.As you learn about the Kings you begin to look at your own heart and what is really in it--you look at your attitudes and motives and you decide which Kings charater and attributes you want for your life.I feel it is also representative of the different levels of Christianity--Is your focus on the Kingdom and God and his will being done here on earth? Is it worldly and all about what I can for me? or Are we a usuper of someone else's place and position because we think we are intitled to it, for whatever reason?It makes you look at yourself and your motives in your relationship with the Lord."
3,Well written classic,"I just finished my second reading of this book. The first time I would have given in 5 stars, but this time I may be looking at it from a more skeptical eye. Edwards' well-written book tells the story of Saul, David, and Absalom and draws subtle illustrations on the subject of leadership and God's will in leadership. In effect uses David as the Model of leadership, and that he never attempted to overthrow Saul, nor stop Absalom. He just did nothing, and the will of God just happened.But doesn't God use leaders to speak out against Sauls. Was Bonhoeffer wrong in his attempt to assassinate Hitler? Should America stayed out of the war and done nothing so that God's will could have its way.I'm not saying Edwards is wrong, but these are the questions I'm left with. Perhaps I get exactly what he was saying. Perhaps he was just speaking about leadership within the church.Whatever my misgivings, I'm still glad I took the time to read this interesting, well-written book"
1,Disappointed,"While Edwards' book is great literature, I found it theologically, biblically, and pastorally empty for those traumatized by abusive churches and denominational leadership. Where is NT church discipline where we call both members and leaders into account in a gentle spirit that speaks the truth in love. I much prefer VanVonderen's When God's People Let You Down and books like Allender's Bold love that help us deal abusive people. I'm sorry that I bought the book and will not read anything more by this author although I had thought about it."
3,Not what I thought it was,"I read the book, but found it to be just more of what is already out there. There was nothing really inspiring or new in the message,"
3,Decent expected too much...,This is a decent book. It gives a few good pointers but it lacks scripture reference. So many people recommended this book to me that I guess I expected too much.
1,Don't purchase this item!!!!!,I bought this DVD. It didn't play. I asked for a replacement. It also didn't play.It was a great disappointment as I was looking forward to watching this program.
4,Hank bears his soul and his weight on DVD...,"This two-fer for Rollins fans is an easter egg. Half the stories he tells on both discs are tales told already on his spoken albums, but now have a nice visual touch added in for an even more intense view of Rollins' wonderfully twisted psyche. From travel stories, to personal enlightenment, to the death of friends..., Rollins has a superb gift for making the most mundane experiences we all share, to tight and personal stories you were miles away from, into events the audience can take away as a present, feel they were walking with him, laugh and hate, and feel good overall. Very good, very funny, very touching. A must for anyone who likes to hear a good story."
5,Amazing Book,"This book was so exciting, I couldn't put it down. If there is only one book you read all year, it should be this one. Victor Carl starts out on a seedy mission of revenge, but slowly comes to believe his hapless client is innocent. How he goes about proving it is amazing, and I don't want to give anything away, but you won't be sorry you read this book."
4,Victor is back on track...and so is Lashner...,"Fatal Flaw is far better than Bitter Truth, in league with the first book in the series, Hostile Witness. This book is lengthy, but does not feel overly long. The long, wandering passages of Bitter Truth are no where to be found (nor are any references to that story). A twisting, turning, but never hard to follow plot keeps you intrigued. And Victor, while not more successful, really has grown up. Well, not in his choice of women, but certainly in his understanding and the fact that he is not striving for money here. That is a refreshing change. I was still annoyed to see Beth as a secondary character. Even more, why the heck was Morris Kapustin ignored (ok, there was one mention). Couldn't have been used in some way? Oh, those are minor quibbles (as Skink is a good PI). I look forward to the next adventure of Victor Carl."
2,Impossible,"This is an OK book, but it's too long and the author seems to write long passages to no effect becuase it's fun, not because the story needs it. As usual, small town America is the root of evil and there wasn't much mystery about the real murderer's identity. We have an attempt on the hero's life by the standard technique of running his car off the road; this never works, so why bother? The plot is also totally impossible, because no attorney could represent a defendent, when the attorney is the person who finds the dead body, and the murder weapon, and who sees the naked defendant outside the house where the murder occurs. He would be a prosecution witness. Perry Mason used to do the same in the TV series (not in the books) but the author should know better."
5,VICTOR CARL SERIES # 3,"I have really become a fan of William Lashner. This Victor Carl, lawyer from Philadelphia, is outstanding. I think this third book is the most entertaining of the three I have read and think it can stand alone. I always say read the series in order and still do but this one stands alone if you must. Love is the issue her and a siren that effects everyone she meets is murdered. Who done it? LoL. Great story, a little predictable and wordy but a good story with our man Victor more deeply involved than the prosecution knows. I really enjoyed it. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED."
3,It could have been better,"I didn't dislike this book as much as it bored me in too many places. Victor Carl's constant analyzing of his morals, philosophizing about love or not love or whatever is endlessly, endlessly overdone. He also repeats his confused uninteresting thoughts endlessly, endlessly. The only decent person in this cast is Victor's partner, Beth who barely makes a dent in this narrative. Lashner should make her the chief character in his jaded view of the lawyerly conduct.The story itself is interesting and the twists somehow worked. A good premise somewhat undone by boring, pretentious blather. I'll keep reading some more of Lashner's work, hoping for better than this. He can write."
2,"Unlikable characters, slow plot.","Let me start by saying I read books for character; if I don't like the characters, it's a good bet I won't like the book. For me, this book didn't have a single character about whom I could care. There's the lawyer who is cheating on his wife and family, there is the protagonist lawyer who is having an affair with his ""best friend's"" mistress. That alone was enough to make me stop reading. If that doesn't bother you, the plot was decent enough, although slow and, at points very repetitive. The only reason I ranked this higher than NR was because, to be fair, others in our Mystery Group rated this book Good to Very Good. While they agreed they didn't like any of the characters and found some things improbable, they felt the characters and plot were well done. But for me, I kept thinking how many other, better books with more interesting characters I had waiting to be read."
4,much better than standard fare (4.5 really)--but one issue,"Lashner is an amazingly witty writer, and it is a great pleasure to read his books. Plus, the set-up here is more interesting and exciting than Hostile Witness. Still, Hostile Witness was better, because the writing was better. The one problem I had with Fatal Flaw--its flaw--was the constant repetition of words and phrases for supposed emphasis. Ex.: ""I told him, I told him and then"", etc., etc. Just a guess, here, but they must have been trying to reach a word or page minimum--the repetions are that pervasive, that obvious, and, too often, that out of place and distracting. Lashner is too good for such a trick, and I am still delighted to have discovered him and delighted that I read this otherwise outstanding and entertaining thriller."
2,"Too much repeating, too much repeating, too much repeating",This is the first and last book by William Lashner that I will read. It lost me after just the first chapter or so. I just could not stand his stupid and utterly rediculous habit of repeating every other word or phrase. I just could not stand his stupid and utterly rediculous habit of repeating every other word or phrase.See how annoying it is?!
2,"John Grisham, he ain't",This is the first (and only) book of Lashner's I expect to read. It was necessary to read nearly half the book before it became interesting. Mr. Lashner spends too much space describing things not related to the story and continues to repeat himself in a most boring manner. I only rate him two stars because most of the last half of the book was interesting but still not comparable to many of the other 'lawyer' books. No more Lashner for me.
3,Would get 5 stars if it worked with Vista,"I am wondering how long it takes to get in the mindset of looking to see if devices are compatible with Vista BEFORE I buy them and try to install them??Yes, I just recently got a Vista computer and am not used to it. Most of the programs play nice with Vista, but this one didn't... I tried installing it and ran into errors...it wasn't compatible. The installation finished anyway and I thought maybe it actually did work. I tried to connect to my bluetooth device (cell phone) and it did connect, but then it tried to install the drivers again (it must have bypassed them the first time) and it was pointless. I checked the website and, nope, no Vista drivers.So now I have a useless $30 dongle and have to try and find one that will work with Vista."
1,No instructions and will not install,Not only will Windows Vista not recognize the adapter it will not install the software. The instructions are for installing the adapter on a system running Windows XP. Instructions on the internet are less than helpful and I was never able to find the Kodak software. A real dissapointment from Belkin.
2,Brands fail too,"I am the kinda guy who will pay enormous premium for branded products. This toy I bought just dint work. Poor documentation/implementation. At some point, when I got this to work, my wifi on the laptop wouldnt work. I may try Linksys in the future, but have not bought a replacement yet."
2,Issue connecting about half of the time.,"I have the latest drivers for Vista but I'm constantly plagued with connection issues. Right now I'm trying to download some images from my Samsung cell phone. The bluetooth app starts up and I hear a connection tone but nothing allows me to transfer the images. This sort of thing happens about half the time. Of course, A reboot will resolve things but that is a work-around, not a solution."
2,"Nice photo's, little substance","The photography is good. If you are looking for pictures of weddings for possible ideas or just to see other photographers wedding photo journalistic styles, it's only an OK reference.If you're looking for more advanced techniques on finding beautiful light, best poses for your subjects, as well as camera and flash techniques for the photo journalism style, there's not enough information here."
1,"No Substance, photos disappointing on the Kindle Edition","As someone else noted - photos appeared posed, not natural. Also, photos don't look all that great on Kindle and do not appear to be optimized for it. Given that there is very little substance other than the photos, the book is not of much use on a Kindle."
5,Part-time wedding photographer,"I found this an easy read, and very helpful. What I liked about the book it was not just by one photographer, but many. Each one brought to the book their point of view about wedding Photojournalism, and how they do it. I'm starting to do weddings in this style, so it was nice to hear how the real pros shoot them."
2,"Ehhh! Nice pics, but not much on substance!","I'm not sure why this book got so many 4-5 star reviews! Obviously, it's full of great photographer's work. But this book, in my humble opinion, is one for the coffee table. It seems to be a compilation of work promoting a group of WPPI photographers - the first 4-5 pages spotlight all the featured photographers - which dilutes the book far too much. If you are new to wedding photography (as I am - i've only been shooting weddings for about a year) I suggest you readDigital Wedding Photography: Capturing Beautiful Memories. Best of luck!"
4,Well worth looking at because.............,"I always approach this type of book by looking firstly at the images and then reading the details. The images in this book are inspirational and of a high quality. I know from personal experience just how hard wedding photography can be and I think Bill has done a good job with this book. It always helps to have such beautiful women to photograph and Bill's photojournalistic approach works well - the candid images are very good. I enjoyed the written explanations, but I am left with the slight feeling that more diagrams and photos of the techniques could have made this book really outstanding. A great advert for the photographer though and well worth buying! (most of which I have said about his other books on wedding photography!)"
4,Beautifully Illustrated,"This book has wonderfully warm photos to illustrate the joy of ""Wedding Photojournalism"", by several photojournalists. I found it interesting to read, informative, with helpful posing possibilities and techniques."
3,"Great perspective, difficult writing","Ms. Tuchman is a good historian, but this book wanders before finding some focus. My friend asked what the theme was and a quarter of the way into it I couldn't really tell, which is a shame because so much of this part of our history was unknown to me. The book does pick up and is worth the buy, but its not an easy read."
2,Poorly written and eminently forgettable.,A huge disappointment. I love well-written books about early US history. I found this book to be so poorly written that I began to forget what it was saying before I even finished it. Not recommended.
5,A broader view of the Revolution,"Wonderfully, wonderfully written. If only high school texts had Tuchman's easy-going fluency I would have retained a lot more History.Much of this book, of course, focuses on the war impact on The Dutch and The French. To that end, it truly presents the Revolution as the first world war. Much of her discussion is of the ineptitude of the British leadership at the time. There are excellent profiles, particularly of Sir Rodney."
4,Starts slow but builds speed,"This book is slow-going for the first hundred pages or so, but pleasure and insight await the reader who's willing to tough it out. Certainly not Tuchman's best, but it'll do..."
2,Is a bad Tuchman still worth reading?,"A tour guide at Williamsburg recommended this as 'essential' reading and since I had enjoyed Tuchman's ""A Distant Mirror"" I was ready for a good book. Into the fourth page describing intricate and, to me, unimportant interrelationships of the Danish royal family I came to the conclusion that at some point in this book's production Tuchman just gave up. So I did to. The chunk I did read was very well researched but I don't need to read a summary of everything Tuchman read in researching this book. The choppy writing and, most importantly, lack of editing wore me out. Is a bad Tuchman worth reading? If you need to know every angle about the American Revolutuion the answer may be 'yes.' But, for me, the answer is 'no', not when there are so many other good books out there."
3,"good, but not her best","This book is interesting and informative, but much more as a collection of curious trivia than as a coherent history of the Revolution. What Ms. Tuchman covers about European politics during the war years may well indeed be more topical and important than our textbooks would suggest-- but it is presented in an almost chaotic fashion that only obscures her main points. This book will not give you any sort of contextual, continuous, and sensible account of the events of the war from any point of view. Read it as a general-interest Tuchman specimen _after_ being converted by the splendid ""Guns of August"" and ""Proud Tower""."
1,The old girl's lost the plot,"Ir rambled on and on, and I didn't finish it. I concluded that Tuchman was going gaga and didn't know she needed an editor."
2,"Dry, but different focus","Tuchman was recommended to me-- I will read another of her books to see what the hype is about. This one was dry and slow-going.Although focusing on naval and European interest in the Revolution, it was still just tough to keep slogging through. I wouldn't recommend it."
1,Better than taking sleeping pills.,"I am a lover of history. American, English, and Roman are my favorites. A good history book, brings history alive. This book does not. It is one of the slowest, dull books I've ever tried to read. Mrs. Tuchman should find another line of work, as she has no business pretending to be an author. This book does not rate a review longer than this."
5,Surprisingly enjoyable,These were written in China for use in teaching Chinese to non-native speakers and they are surprisingly good and surprisingly enjoyable. They are a little focused on things an undergrad would need to say ... I have not needed to ask anyone in China where his dormitory was. And they are obviously written with Chinese students in mind ... most Americans would not start with an early distinction between older brother (gege) and younger brother (didi) or grand mother on father's side (nai nai) and grand mother on mother's side (wai po). But the books are well designed and actually work well for self instruction.
4,Intermediate/Advanced Chinese Book,"I learned a lot of characters and more complicated dialogue, but I feel that 2 semester on this book was not enough for me. Still, as long as you get help from Chinese teachers and tutors both before, during, and after the semester is over, your Chinese can greatly be stable and improve. I recommend this book for those that really want to learn Mandarin Chinese.I also heard that there are Chinese Books that go up to volume 6. I wish the community college that I go to went up to Chinese 6, but unfortunately, that is not the case."
2,Glossy paper,"I was kind of disappointed reading this book.Very little practical advise can be found inside.Honestly, I found more information on the web and feel kind of cheated. Good quality of paper and color photographs inside thought.Thanks, Vlad"
3,A valve that might or might not last.,The valve started out working really great but after only a few months it never shut off all the way and water would constantly flow out of the sprinkler heads. Once it started leaking through it was only about a week before it went from damp to a constant flow. I can't understand why so many of these don't last yet I have others that are well over 5 years old that work perfect. Toro has always been a really good brand so I had hoped these would be better than the rest. I don't know if all of these type are made by just a couple of manufacturers and then they just get a label on them but if you use this type I'm sure you've noticed they all look very much alike. Bottom line is it's hit and miss regardless of brand.
5,Sprikler Valve Adapter,I was not able to find this product locally and had to order by Internet. The manufacturer has changed from Lawn Genie to Toro but it is exactly the same than the previous adapter that I replaced. I works well and it is easy to install. One of the nice features is that the valve has an internal bleed that allows manual on/off operation and flushing.
5,AWESOME LOVE STORY,"I happen to stumble upon this book, and I must say this was an GREAT LOVE STORY!! Great job Mr. Arnold. Don't sleep on this book!!!! Looking forward to Part 2!!"
3,"It's Captivating, But...","I read the sample without really meaning to--what a captivating start to a book. Most of us have probably been in that car situation or something similar. But, gosh, it needs a good edit! There are places where it is over-written and others where there are grammatical errors. It distracts. Too bad."
4,Loving Lovin' Mrs. Jones,"Loving Mrs. Jones was zesty reading for a first time author. I enjoyed the book and look forward to the sequel. Although the book was written from the male perspective, I think all females can relate."
4,"Good read,..just a little wordy","I enjoyed reading this book. I just found it to be a little too wordy (explaining/describing everything). But overall it was good...hated the cliff-hanger (smile). However, I am looking forward to the sequel!"
2,Not What I Expected,"This was a very lengthy book with poor dialog that didn't leave much to the imagination. Everything that was thought, was written. Now I understand why inferencing is so important (giving every little detail makes the story boring). The story lacked a well thought out plot and developed characters. It has some interesting ideas, however, they weren't aggrandized. I believe that the formatting caused some gaps in the story (or should I say I hope it was caused by formatting but I'm just speculating) as some sentences started but when the page was turned they didn't finish. The next page would start with a totally different idea. The main male character was suppose to be such a beautiful, strong, independent man, but to me seemed more like a punk. He couldn't make up his mind to say anything, when it counted. With the help of a good editor this story can blossom.Twana Spencer Brunson"
5,soul inspiring,Very moving soul inspiring love story. I couldn't put it down. I Can't wait for the sequel I hope its longer.
4,Going Out on A Limb,"Can u meet someone days and I do mean DAYS b/f your wedding and have feelings so strong/new that u begin to question your current relationship? Well that's what happens in this book. The 2 characters chemistry were flying off the charts. It starts innocent enough, but what each is thinking to themselves, the other is also thinking the same thing. Do u throw away a current relationship or do u go out on a limb and take a chance w/something new that mentally just feels right?"
5,Lovin' Mrs. Jones: A Love Story (Book 1),"This book was very good. I read it in one day. It was a real page turner and I wanted to read if Mrs. Jones and Gabriel was going to finally be together but I was hit with an unexpected ending and is now anticipating the release of the sequel to this book. Those that purchase this book will not be disappointed in all, if anything you will escape into the pages and become consumed with the storyline."
4,loved it!,1st Mr.Arnold needs to write part 2 ASAP. TRUE LOVE STORY HE REALLY HAD ME CAPTURED AND UPSET WHEN I GOT TO THE LAST PAGE I WAS SO READY FOR More Gabriel and Alex. Sign UP FOR THE EMAILS TO INFORM YOU WHEN PART 2 WILL BE OUT.
5,Simply Beautiful,"This was a very moving love story. The title leads you to think that it is the usual story of a lust laced affair, but the love between Alex and Gabe was genuine. The writing is so poetic, that by the end of the book, you would have thought that you were listening to two friends tell their story of how they found love.What I love most is that story was not full harsh words & meaningless sex.Good job Mr. Arnold, you have another fan."
3,Lovin' Mrs Jones: A Novel,"It was an easy, enjoyable read. A delightful love story and a feel-good reminder of what it is like being truly connected with the one you love.There were a few gaps in the story where I wondered if I had missed something and had to 'guess' what might have occurred. I was also a bit disappointed by the spelling/grammar errors that haven't been picked up in the editorial process.The ending was a little abrupt, would have loved more..."
1,Mediocre,"Very disappointing reading after such good reviews. Very superficial writing -primitive plot, lengthy yet empty dialogs, poor descriptions. Not realistic, not well- thought through. Waste of time."
5,Captivating to the End,"Immediately after reading the Preface, I felt drawn to the characters. As I read word after word and line after line I felt that the characters were no longer ""book character's"" but my friends... people that I knew. I found myself moving on an emotional roller coaster as I turned the pages. I couldn't read fast enough. This book was TRULY captivating. I am sure that a movie of the book would be a box office hit!!! I anxiously await the sequel because the ending was NOT AT ALL what I expected."
5,Love....unpredictable.....wonderful,"This book was awesome. I will read and reread this book. I have never gotten so attached to a character and her feelings.I was there and I was her. Undescribable.If you dream of love and and always wondering how real it can be, this is the book for you.Experience the moments, they are heartfelt. Just when you think you've experienced all love has to offer, life springs a surprise. WOW!"
5,Awesome,"This book was amazing!! I could notput it down, I finished it in one day. Can't wait for the second one!"
4,Soulmate matters,"I read up to 85% on my Kindle in one day. I did not want it to end so I extended the last 15% into the next evening until I could not take it any longer and finally consumed the entire selection hoping to find a link pointing me to the sequel. Capivating love story. Here is to hoping the next book picks up where Alexandria and her soulmate, Gabriel Washington, left off. If you have yet to find your soulmate then you may not get this text; if you are looking for the soulmate then you may want to check this text out for paying attention to your heart not your head."
5,Great Product,"I take thisfor energy not weight loss.This is the only product that helps me get out of bedin the morning, helping with my fatigue!!!"
4,A sample of a versatile musician,"It's a master sample of the ability of a man with a high love for the music and of course with the high capacity to sing whatever he wants. It's sad that this CD had just five songs, I would rather something else."
3,The Honeydrippers Vol. 1,"The music was as I expected, but the length of the CD was disappointing.I felt it should be longer for the price paid. However, I do enjoy the music."
3,"GOOD ROCKIN""","Sea Of Love is the first song I heard from this album. Yes it was an album when I bought it the first go round. But, I kinda took to Rockin' At Midnight. A big band take on Good Rockin' Tonight. Lost a star after I heard Solomon Burke do the song."
1,Don't buy this for Robert Plant....,"I remember when this came out... Robert Plant crooning away like Wayne Newton? Sea of Love...pullleeease! Blown away? More like just plain blows! I saw his solo tour when this came out...the encore consisted of this tripe with the band all decked out in satin and sequin suits. I almost barfed! We made a quick exit. If you like that kind of stuff, you'll probably think it's good. If you're looking for something more along the lines of Zeppelin, or actual rock and roll, go somewhere else. Anywhere else."
5,A Return to Zep Roots,"I remember this album from its debut. I didn't get it. I was way beyond the whole rockabilly sound. Swing didn't swing. But since it was a Zep side project I thought I would check it out. Nope, I didn't get it. So what changed? Not the Honeydrippers...Anyone who doesn't get this album -- or, more specifically, it's place in Zep history -- needs to check out the Whole Lotta Love medley on ""How the West was Won."" This live version segues through several blues standards and sounds, at times, like a mini-concert of the Honeydrippers. It doesn't have the whole Big Band thing going on, but it's definitely got the rockabilly/blues/swing thing working. That entire CD (HTWWW) made me appreciate the breadth and depth of Plant's and Page's (and Bonham's) abilities more than ever.Now I appreciate the Honeydrippers. I think I ""get"" what this was all about. It's an homage to their roots. It's another side to their musicianship. It's a Whole Lotta Fun."
1,Intec Multitap for Slimline PS2 - Don't waste your money,"I purchased this multitap to play Rayman Raving Rabbids with my kids. It would only recognize one controller. I also tried it with Justice League Heroes, with the same results again.Don't waste your time and money buying this because it looks cool or is cheaper than others, it's not worth the aggravation."
4,+2 Fun!,The Multi-Tap worked on my slim PS2. It was very easy to set up.My friends and I enjoy playing with more than two people.
2,Billard As it Should be Played,Book was small and have difficult time reading and seeing the diagrams. There is a larger size of the same book. I'm still looking for it.
2,Disappointing,"I was really disappointed in the content of this book. Rather than focusing on the historical data the author seemed more interested in spinning a interesting story based on his interpretation of fact. The book has the feel of a historical novel and contains a lot of editorializing in the place of solid analyis. Documentation of his stories and sources could be better. His bibliography is weak considering the vast amount of data available, both original source and works written in the last 50 years. To be fair the book is very readable despite it's shortcomings. Some chapters are not as scholarly as I would expect and I think that a person who has more of a technical interest in the subject would be better served by other titles."
2,Pleasant,"Destroying Angels is kind of a pleasant book in a way. You like the protaganist, and that helps. It had a hard time holding my interest as the pacing was so even that I can't say I found the suspense very compelling. True mystery lovers might like the book better than I did though."
3,Mill drama!,"Set in 1830, just post-regency, this novel has none of the charm and idealism of the regency genre. It is a perhaps over dramatic story of a young girl, Dandre, who feels Mr. Chesterton is up to something and is determined to find out what. Chesterton's highly unbelievable stay in a cotton mill is made intensely ludicrous by the gently-bred heroine joining him there. However if one can overlook the melodrama this is a touching love story with some charm. It also manages to convey a frightening and very interesting amount of detail on life in the mills at that time and the attempts at social reform. Quite good."
2,NO EXIT,"The film moves along as if it is a poorly done version of ""No Exit."" A man and a woman are in a prison. They don't know how they got there. There are strange things going on as well as annoying flashbacks. There is also a subplot of a model being interrogated for murder. She attempts to act sexy and cool during the questioning aka Sharon Stone. We also see dead bodies (no faces).As a ""No Exit"" type movie, it was cleverly, but poorly done. I know that is hard to do. It was a good idea, but poorly executed. The acting and dialouge had the poor quality of a soft core film. There were no tense or scary scenes as the scenes change too often with annoying flashbacks to allow it.Now if you thought I gave you a plot spoiler, I didn't as this wasn't a ""No Exit"" film. While the ending tied the movie together, I just shook my head and said, ""You got to be kidding."" The shorter German version was far better. No sex or nudity. Not worth the view."
5,WoW !!!!! =))),"The story is really sweet that I swear it made me smile all day long (even in my sleep, I think =P). Master of Desire is my first book of her. I love it sooo much that I finally went hunting for her older books and found this book at my fave used bookstore. Jack is sooo gentleman. And the way he act towards Lori is so nice and sweet. This book is really a keeper ^_^"
3,Good book - not a fantastic Kinley book!,"Everyone of the MacAllister series and the knight books I absolutely loved and gave 5 stars too. I just did not feel either Jack nor Lorelei were the compelling characters as in the other books. Jack started out too cockey and too sure of his seductive powers and Lorelei seemed all to sure of her powers to make any man fall to her charms. Neither quite appeared vulnerable enough to really make you feel as strongly for them, as in the other Kinley books. Still I do like Kinley's style of writing and found even this book better than many many other novels out there. And I will give a go at Pirate of her Own about Morgan."
2,Blah...,"Oh Lord!!! And to think I bought all the books in this series (6 total I think)...I hope they at least get a little better because this one was bad. One day I'll learn my lesson and buy one book at a time, but I thought since Sherrilyn Kenyon(she writes as Kinley MacGregor) wrote these they would be good, but this one was not."
3,readable but short,"This book was good, but not great. I bought it on the absolutely glowing reviews here. Ms. Macgregor is a good story teller, although I thought this book seemed to be missing some detail. I liked the interjection of humor, which is often missing in romance novels. One last note, and this is my pet peeve, the picture of the half naked man on the front does not in any way reflect Jack as written. He is supposed to be blond. Why do they put those stupid pictures on anyway, it makes it impossible to leave the house for fear someone might see and make fun of your reading choice."
3,Good Enough,"""Master of Seduction"" is the second Kinley MacGregor book I've read and it was certainly better than ""Master of Desire"". The characters were nicely developed and the story far more interesting. The romance aspect was sweet, although the love scenes were rather tame. The ending was terribly unbelievable...in that everyone is forgiven quite easily for past wrong-doings no matter how awful: the jilted fiance, the abused and abandoned son, etc. And sorry to nitpick, but the cover model was an unappealing brunette, while the story portrayed our hero as a dashing blond pirate.However, the book flowed well and it was an easy and light read. I will sample more of Ms. Macgregor's books, but I think I like her writing as Sherilyn Kenyon better."
5,great book!,Was just what I expected when I made my order. Could not have been better described and was just as it was reported to be.
3,a good book and a great author,"Master of Seduction is the story of Black Jack Rhys and Lorelei, who I first read about in A Pirate of Her Own. I read them backwards. They both are stand alone books but it is enjoyable to read about Morgan from the second book in this one and Jack and Lorelei in the second book.Jack is a notorious pirate and Lorelei is helping her English fiance track him down. Jack kidnapps her when he realizes she knows who he really is. He is very strongly attracted to her and she to him but they try and fight thier attraction until passion wins out. Jack is deeply troubled by his past and Lorelei must break thru it all to get to the good man beneath the hard shell of Pirate.This book is filled with humor and adventure and passion and tenderness. I really enjoyed it and look forward to more by this author. I would really like to read a book about Kit Jack's son when he grows up."
2,"Blood Diamonds, Bleeding Heart","The author is trying to sensationalize the bloodshed that resulted from the diamond trade in Africa. His allegations that the smugglers or the people who buy the product as jewelry are somehow culpable is unsubstantiated. In any other part of the world, such resources would've been a stabilizing factor that enriched the nation economically, bringing jobs, added tax revenues, better schools, etc. This is really a book about the inability of a populace to police itself and the author's focus on the ""guilt"" of the West is just bullcrap. The one chapter on Al Qaeda and the diamond trade was interesting but short on concrete facts. This is lousy journalism."
4,It's ironic how marriage engagements are sealed with other people's blood,"What? The title doesn't make sense? Did you know how many people suffered to get the diamond on your wife's or fiancé's hand? I don't either, but you can take a guess once you read this book. Come, take a ride to a place where children spend their last breaths in a ditch, sifting dirt and mud for the precious stones. Take a walk with the men that die in jungles while transporting this contraband to another country. Sit down with the monsters who butcher the pregnant women, who cut the arms of teenagers, who kill for pleasure.This is not fiction, my friend, this is real and it occurs even now as you read this review. And it will continue to occur until the value of diamonds remains artificially inflated by DeBeers' monopoly. But I know, next time an anniversary or marriage comes along, you'll still buy a diamond for your wife or fiancé. What do you care, you don't have to die to buy...By Simon Cleveland"
1,MISSING PAGES!!?!?!,"I GOT THIS BOOK AS A GIFT ONLY TO HEAR FROM THE PERSON I GAVE IT TO THAT THE BOOK WAS MISSING PAGES!?! IT WASN'T THAT THE BOOK HAD PAGES TORN OUT, JUST THAT IT WAS PUT TOGETHER WRONG, THE SAME CHAPTER WAS IN THE BOOK 3 TIMES, IT SKIPPED FROM PAGE 18 TO PAGE 30, RESULTING IN A BOOK THAT MAKES NO SENSE!!?!?! BEWARE OF BUYING!!! MAKE SURE YOU CAN EXCHANGE IT FOR A NEW ONE IF THIS HAPPENS TO YOU!!"
5,Exposes the integral role diamonds played in the war,"For over ten years Sierra Leone was devastated by civil war, but nothing contributed to its downfall more than the diamond, which funded rebel groups, served as the foundation for attacks and bloodshed, and destroyed the lives of its people. Blood Diamonds exposes the integral role diamonds played in the process of war in the country, creating an eye-opening story of bloodshed in the name of wealth."
5,A GEM OF A BOOK,"Want to buy a nice diamond for your loved one? Read this book and you will, hopefully, change your mind. What if your loved one could not wear a diamond because his/her hands been cut off by people in the diamond pipeline?Did you know that the DeBeers Corporation (world's largest diamond company) is an illegal entity in the USA and that no more than four of their employees may be in the USA at the same time? Read this fascinating and disturbing book to learn how fortunes have been made mining and marketing diamonds to an unsuspecting public.Congratulations to the author for shedding some light on the horrific abuses carried out in the name of ""luxury goods."""
4,Pure Pop Paradise,"Her first solo album, released by the Imago label which soon after went belly up, this was criminally under-promoted.The ""big"" single was the very beatles-esque ""I Should've Known"". While a good tune, the true gems are gorgeously depressing ""4th of July"" and the pop masterpiece ""Say Anything"" (which, amazingly is entirely performed by Aimee and producer Jon Brion) - quite possibly the best marriage of brilliant songwriting and production of the ninties. Of course, this record came out during the zenith of the grunge revolution - when ""pop"" was almost as dirty a word as ""liberal"" has become since the Reagan/Bush era..."
5,Aimee Mann....Where are you?????,"The most elegantly written collection of songs about heartbreak, frustration, longing and dissapointment. The music and arrangement styles differ on each song and are constantly challenging the senses.Why this woman isn't a household name remains one of the great mysteries of the world.Do yourself a favor and buy one of the few ""great"" albums of the 1990s."
5,Aimee's music is like fine wine.,"Being a fan of Aimee's solo output and 'Til Tuesday, I find that I still perfer mid-period Aimee. ""Whatever"" and TT's ""Everything's Different Now"" remain for me her best releases. Is it because she writes songs that continue to enfold us with truth and meaning? They get better with age for me, and these two hit home right away and continue to be my favorite albums from the 80's (EDN) and 90's (Whatever). I don't think I'll ever be able to put ""I'm With Stupid"" up with these two, but ""Bachelor No. 2"" might make it someday."
2,Don't buy this.,"I had Aimee Mann's superb second album ""I'm With Stupid,"" so I bought ""Whatever"" thinking that it would pretty much sound the same. Big mistake. Whereas her second album was filled with intelligent and edgy tunes, ""Whatever"" seems like a bubble gum pop album. Aside from ""I Should've Known,"" the rest of the CD sounds like the kind of songs Belinda Carlisle would write. A surprisingly weak effort."
2,Sadly voices carry,"Sorry to break the fantastic chain of 5 stars but in a case like this it had to be done. I was very excited to buy this album and thought nothing but great things would come from the alluring vocals of Aimee Mann. However, I found myself quite bored and eagerly anticipating the end of the CD. The lyrics seemed flat and needed to have matured a few years to keep up with the more profound writing of this era. I didn't find a single song to be catchy or worthy of immediate replay once finished. Vocals, too, seemed somewhat frail and lacking of any depth...almost as if she just discovered her vibrato and forced it. Maybe I'm missing something as all the reviews have been so good but I'm going down to the used record store and swapping it out for a sure bet, like Stevie Nicks."
3,GO ON AN ADVENTURE,Well I thought that this video was well thought out and very exciting. buy this video if you like skiing
3,i truely do not know what to make of this book...,"i read this book for the first time several years back...since then i've re-read parts and shared my copy with a few friends...my problem is that this book is portrayed as a non-fiction account of the life and crimes of one athol visser...yet countless people(in the know)have assured me that no such person ever existed...i sort of enjoyed this book(i say sort of because parts where extremely well written) but certain parts were too much...i guess i have trouble with the part where the author claims that the entire works were penned verbatim...i mean, are we to believe that a person with this kind of background suddenly developed a gift for writing?? i'd like to hear from someone else that has read this book...what do you think? is this merely a novel or did it really happen?"
1,A true disappointment!,"I would recommend AGAINST this shower curtain. We thought ours (white) was perfect for our beach-themed bathroom. It looked fantastic against the turquoise walls! BUT THEN WE WASHED IT. We had to wash it because the white turned quite yellow. The seams' finished edges frayed COMPLETELY, leaving long ropes of bound, detached edges behind the curtain! One even frayed enough to leave a 2"" gap in one of the quadrant seams. The seams puckered severely, and the center seam distorted badly, pulling in a curve toward one side. It's going back to the place of purchase tomorrow! What a shame such a cheaply made object fools people into buying it because it bears the Nautica label."
5,BEST BILLY VAUGHN COLLECTION AVAILABLE ON 2 CDS!,"I have many of these greatest hits on lps and waited impatiently for a CD release. Because Billy Vaughn had big hits in Latin America, South America, Africa, Japan, Hong Kong, Australia, Sweden, Germany and the US among other countries, it is definitely a feat to include just 50 of his most popular on a 2 CD collection. This collection was originally aimed at the German market. Yes, there are some HITS missing including US and German hits but those are available on other CD collections. Some of the tracks are in mono but that is because they either were not recorded in stereo (Sail Along Silvry Moon, Melody of Love, Raunchy, etc.) or a stereo master is not available. The greatest thing about his collection is that many of the cuts were previously available only on 45 rpm singles.This is the best introduction to the most successful studio orchestra of the rock n roll era."
5,Finally!!,"I had been haunting music stores and collectors for the last two years, looking for CDs or tapes of Billy Vaughn. Many of his songs stand out in my mind but mostly it was ""Shifting, Whispering Sands"" that I really wanted. The rest are icing on my cake but what an icing it is! Superb."
2,The 'Best' of Billy Vaughn...?,"While this CD contains 50 of Billy Vaughn's original hits, the versions all seem to be low to mid fidelity. The version of ""Sail Along Silvry Moon"" is not the more peppy, layered radio version that many of us are used to hearing [with the harmonizing saxophones].I returned this product and purchased the ""Sail Along Silv'ry Moon/Blue Hawaii"" CD which contains the better remastered recordings... it contains only half the number of tracks, however.Billy Vaughn is the best!"
4,The Best of Billy Vaughn and his Orchestra,Still waiting for - The Best of Billy Vaughn & His Orchestra CD. Will watch for further versions especially those from EMI Music Australia..
2,"Outstanding!, but Not a complete collection.","This is not a complete collection, this contains only the first two volumes(..Seasons if you will.),""Rozen maiden"", and ""Rozen maidens:Träumend"". However there is a third called ""Rozen maiden:Overture"", unfortunatly, it seems that there are only two episodes made so-far, weather or not there anymore made, and if we offered this season remains to be seen.I have seen the two episodes of the third season, and there is no closure to the series, in fact it just started to shed light on the doll's pasts, and to the origin of the ""Alice game"". This is the only reason I gave it a two star rating, otherwise this series is a perfect score!"
1,Cheep Plastic,"Bad choice if you have any self-respect! Poor construction, not durable, and the cheesiest thing I have seen in a while."
3,"Right Price, Cheap Construction","You get what you pay for, I guess.On the plus side, the shifter is attractive and well priced. The materials, however, feel very cheap. The surface, which feels like those cheap toilet-paper-roll rods (you know, that really light plasticky fake metal feeling), deteriorated quickly. The knob also doesn't tighten well to the shifter rod, so it requires frequent tightening and always wobbles a bit for me.Still, it's usable, and the price is right."
4,try this out...,a little more depth to this album than the first... better production... absolute poppy noise pop... buy this one... never miss them live... ever.
3,Hawkwind - 'Friends And Relations:The Rarities' (Griffin),"A decent fifteen track compilation of often hard-to-find cuts by Hawkwind's offshoot bands,like Inner City Unit,Harvey Bainbridge,Robert Calvert and Atom Bomb.Exactly the same track listing for the UK import CD by the same title on the Anagram/Cherry Red label(see my review),just a totally different cover."
4,Good Basic Fish Finder,This is the first more modern fish finder I have tried out. Good basic finder. Easy to view during the day or night. And pretty accurate once you figure it out. Easy to install. I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a reliable fish/depth finder and doesn't want to drop alot of cash.
2,No Extended-Life Battery Support,"Like most aluminum cases for Dell x50/x50v handlhelds, this case is NOT compatible with the extended-life battery. The extended-life battery (2200mA) adds an additional 1/4 inch to the thickness of the handheld."
2,Very Odd Black-n-White Film,"A movie about nymphomaniacs, in a setting of a alcoholics anonymous meeting in the beginning and then it totally lost me, as woman were molesting every man and then everyone was getting shot and it was all in black and white and looks to have been made in early 60's.And well, waste your two bucks elsewhere, like crumble it up and throw it in the toilet, cuz someone should have done this to this movie long long ago"
1,Stupid,Don't even waste your time with this. An insult to you're eyes and ears. Acting was so bad could not get through the first ten minutes
2,Not That Great,"Just didnt look like what i thought it was gonna look like when i opened it, as far as the map goes. Would probibly be something to have next to you when your looking at a place like Trip Advisor or looking at other peoples pictures of there trip. The whole thing would have been better if it was made into a brochure/travel magazine like you get from a board of tourism. Good info in there but the map set up is all wrong i think. Could have been way better then it is."
3,SparkNotes Can Do Better,"I've found some SparkCharts very helpful, but this one is an exception. It's muddled with information the average Calculus student already knows and doesn't include enough information about more difficult topics. Though I did score a 5 on the exam, it was in spite of - not because of - purchasing this chart."
1,RADIO HIGHLIGHTS OF JIM REEVES,"I do NOT recommend this CD - I got it cause I thought it was the album He'll Have to Go"" - but it's radio broadcasts and certainly not a good sound and not worth the money! A real disappointment and now I'm stuck with it!."
5,Reviews at other link,All the reviews for this album are at the other amazon listing for Ancient EchoesAncient Echoes - Music from the time of Jesus and Jerusalem's Second Temple
4,Battery is a major problem,"Recvd on 4/09/08. Battery lasted 15 mins. LG sent replacement, new batt.last for 45 Minutes. The picture quality is great. So if you got a elec.outlet the cord will reach go for it."
2,Volume problems.,"I bought this as a gift for my husband, but ended up returning it. He says the volume doesn't go high enough with earphones (he used it for watching movies on the plane and really had to strain to hear the sound). His earphones work fine with everything else. Oh well, glad Amazon has a great return policy!"
2,not that good...,At first the unit seemed fine even if the audio is pretty quiet unless its right in your lap. However the battery has lost power in just a couple months and if the cord comes undone for even two minutes it tells me to check the battery. Basically its useful only when it can be plugged in. I'm not sure the audio is loud enough even for two people to share in the backseat of the car.
2,OK when it worked.,"I bought this product (new) in January so that my toddler could watch DVD's for an upcoming flight we were taking. I tested the machine out at home and it worked perfectly- no problems. The player worked great on our trip and the battery held a charge for about 2.5 hours.We've only been able to use this machine twice... I went to charge it up so that we could use it for another flight and it won't play. We aren't getting an error message, the disc is spinning- for some reason the player isn't reading any of th discs we play. (all of which it played before without a problem)I am going to call and see if they will replace it. If not, then we will not be purchasing another LG brand DVD player. I am really bummed out that we really only got one use (one round-trip plane flight) out of it. I was expecting much more."
4,dvd review,The person who I got the DVD player for is very satisfied with the product. And I have also been pleased with the service given by this company. Please keep up the good work.
3,"LG DP771 7"" Portable DVD player",This DVD player has great picture but the volume is not very loud I do not believe it's worth what I payed for it. I bought 1 at Staples for only $69.00 that is much much better.
2,It's too gummy. Looks worse than the scratch.,"This stuff is really terrible. It is very thick, and will stick out like a sore thumb when complete. I did my wife's brand new black toyota, so there was no issue of fading paint. I also thought, ""You can't get black wrong"".In addition, it takes several days just to fix a little scratch. After each application of the different items in the kit, you have to wait 24 hours to dry. After all that work it looked like the paint melted in streaks. Also, you have to be real careful with the wet sanding or you can scratch the original paint around the scratch. I would rather have my old scratch back and use a sharpie.Avoid this product."
1,I Wish I'd Asked Earlier,"Ugh. Just ugh.I bought this in hopes of filling the rock chips and parking lot scratches. Being my first try at body work, I followed the instructions -- a lot of sanding was recommended before and after filling and painting. I should've stopped there. Now I have tiny gray bondo spots and dull sanding marks where the chips were. And Duplicolor doesnt match the Torch/Colorado Red for the 2004-2010 Fords.So after a panicked visit to a Waxing Detailer web forum, I bought a bottle of high-end touch-up and some Meguiar's ScratchX. Lesson learned: Either leave the minor damage alone and cope or get some serious professional advice before undertaking paint/body work."
3,Must be better than DrColorchip,I honestly know nothing about this product but I wanted to share my experience with the DrColorchip product and my experience is that is was totally ineffective and a waste of time and money. You can believe the videos on their website if you want to....
3,"OK, I Guess",I really wish that the description would have been just a little better. You don't get a lot for your money either.
2,winnie the pooh multi tote diaper bag,"The mulitple compartments are nice, (if you can remember where everything is). The only problem is the seam down the front tore after 1 month of use, making it one big compartment that hung open so far you couldn't use that space. Its not as sturdy as of diaper bags I've seen and used. I actually am going to try to return it or at least exchange for a new one so I can give it another try."
1,Not so great,"I had this bag, and liked it because there's lots of room inside, but the lining tore after only a couple of months use, and the separate compartments became a thing of the past. I would not recomend this bag to anyone."
2,Don't Buy,The lining of this diaper bag tore within a few months. It may be worth the $6 but no more than that. I paid $20 in March for this bag and already need a new one.
2,Torn Diaper bag,"The diaper bag is real spacious and offers alot of pockets for organization, but with that being said constantly going in and out of the pockets the velcro and the fabric tares easily. But I still love it, just wish it was manufactured with better material."
2,flimsy,"I've used a real bargain no-name mandolin for years and thought I'd try something a step up. I ordered this, tried it out once and packaged it back up. The gap between the blade and mandolin body makes this mandolin unstable and flimsy. Better off going back to my bargain brand! Bought my other for about $8 10 years ago. Will just grab another one since the blades are finally getting too dull."
4,Effective and Durable,"I bought my first Super Benriner at least 10 years ago. It has gotten a ton of use, especially using the standard flat blade. It is only recently that the main blade has finally become dull. The flat blade isn't available for sale as a replacement unit (as far as I can tell) here on Amazon but I did find it easily via a standard web search. Even if I had to replace the whole unit it would still be worth it, considering the relatively low cost and excellent utility of the Super Benriner. My only complaint is that the plastic finger guard damages the blades when it comes into contact with it, making it effectively useless. I'm investing in protective gloves to use instead to help the blade last longer.I considered upgrading to the more expensive stainless steel Mandolines here on Amazon but I didn't find any convincing arguments to do so."
5,great for the price,I use this four or five times a week. i had the smaller one and it broke while i was moving. like the larger size. easy to swap blades. adjustable thickness. easy to clean. no complaints.
4,Does what it should.,This item is very handy for consistent slicing every time. The safety handle is not very effective so watch your fingers! I use it often and wouldn't be without it.
4,Works well great kitchen tool so easy to use and clean,"Took the advice of other reviewers and got the cut proof gloves with this. There is a little bit of a learning curve, but once you get the hang of it, it works easily to get nicely sliced vegetables and fruits. I have made zucchini lasagna and it turned out great, added in some sliced peppers and cheese. Quick and easy clean up. Be careful when using this it doesn't even seem like it is cutting when you use it. The adjustable blade comes out easily so be sure to tighten it. I wish the instructions were a little better. I rated it four stars because of the instructions which are hard to follow and understand. The slicer works great and it is I easy to adjust the slices haven't used the Julienne part yet but will soon. This is wonderful tool for my Specific Carbohydrate Diet and I will be making some veggie chips soon."
4,Cuts Great,"I love this slicer. I tried one a long time ago (cheaper brand) and wasn't happy. Knowing more about safety and what I wanted helped. Using blade cut and slash resistant cloves really helps. However, I would suggest some instructions to be included with the product. Most of it seems simple, but those of us who are new to this need help. Thank you."
5,Great mandoline,"This is a great mandoline slicer. It is quick and easy to use. Clean up is easy. It would be nice if it came with a case, but it is still a great unit."
5,A slicer for every home,"The slicer is as simple as it is .However , it can do a variety of thickness one would like to have.It could be washed easily .But mind your fingers .You do not want to have them in your salad :)I love it .Hope my review will help with your decision ."
5,A Must Read for the Blended Family!!!,"Terri has a way of putting the complexity of a blended family and the situations which they face in just the right perspective. It helps to have a christian perspective, and the voice of experience."
2,Very Dated & Predictable,This was a boring book plus it is so dated in its cultural aspects that it was annoying to read. Can't recommend the book but do recommend the author's more current writing.
1,*Not* a micro-fiber cloth,"If you bought an Klearscreen cleaning kit it most likely came with two polishing cloths: a ""Micro-Chamois Cloth"" and a""Micro-Fiber 'Terry' Cloth"".I bought this item because the micro-fiber terry cloth was travel-sized and I wanted something a little larger to use as my primary screen-cleaning cloth for my matte screens. This is not at all the same type of cloth as the micro-fiber cloth that comes with the cleaning kit. It has a coarser, rougher texture, and is far less absorbent. That means that it won't to a very good job of cleaning your screen, won't dry it completely, leaves streaks, AND doesn't dry itself very well. The rougher, thicker cloth also means that it doesn't fold and travel as well.I used this a couple times and then threw it away because it really just wasn't good for anything. It never did a good enough job cleaning my screen that I didn't have to follow up with something else. It didn't even make a good dish towel. Would not buy again."
2,Very Unstable!,"A friend gave this to us. They had opened it and had never used it. I understand now that we have it why she didn't put her precious baby into the darn thing... Although very pretty and practical, the bassinet is very unsteady and flimsy. We're due for our 2nd child in October, and as of right now, I don't believe we'll put our little one to sleep in this bassinet. I would love to see and hear from other mothers who own this product... Is it supposed to be this junky or is it just mine?"
2,Couldn't finish it.,"Unbelievable as it sounds, I had to putt this one down. But then I dragged myself through BIRTHRIGHT as well. I love Nora - there's no one like her. But this seemed so tired, as if she, too was tired of it all.I got to page 120 and nothing significant had drawn me into the story, there was no conflict, no adversaries...so dissappointing!And so I re-read my Nora favorites...Honest Illusions #1, the Quinn Brothers series #2...over and over, hoping she'll hit another home run with her old magic."
3,"Good book, yet....","I haven't much luck with Nora Roberts book, but ""Northern Lights"" looked like a good read with its 500+ pages, but after reading this book I have some mixed feeling.Nate Burke is man trying to find some peace after a shooting left his partner dead and Nate a broken man. So he decides to take the job as the chief of police of Lunacy Alaska. After arriving he meet a huge cast of residents including Megan Galloway, an indepenent woman. But all is not right in Lunacy with the discovery of a body that sets of a chain of events.The one things that I didn't like about this book, there were so many character that could keep them straight. Also the ending seem a bit rushed much of the middle of the book could have been cut. Its a must for Ms. Roberts fan, but other might want to wait for the paperback."
4,"Pretty good. I always liked ""Northern Exposure.""","I agree with several of the other reviews of this book. It will remind you a lot of the television series ""Northern Exposure,"" except Nate comes to small-town Alaska as Police Chief instead of a doctor. You can actually take a cast list from the series and compare it to the characters in the book. I also agree that Meg is not as likeable as most heroines, but then she had a jealous slut for a mother and father who went on permanent ""walkabout."" Hopefully, some of Nate's goodness will rub off on her. I enjoyed this book; therefore, the length did not bother me as it did some readers. Not the greatest, but then I only gave it 4 stars."
3,Northern Lights = quite a sight!,"Having been to Alaska, this book was a treat for me. Nora's descriptions of everything Alaska were right on. How does she do it? The story was fair; the hero and heroine were ok. And except for Hopp and Charlene the other characters were flat.I usually like most of Nora's books. She has written some spectacular romance but this wasnt one of them. It was a very long book but I read it quite quickly - maybe because it was double spaced?Since Nora has graduated to the hard cover books, I will rent them from the library from now on. Her J. D. Robb books are a great favorite and amaze me every time."
4,"Never read a NR book before, but will now . . .","After a particulary chaotic Hoilday season, I found myself without a book to read. Feeling a bit desperate, I ransacked my mother's book stash and came upon ""Northern Lights"". My taste in books is usually more eclectic. But having either this or my choice of romance novels, I went with my first Nora Roberts book. Boy, was I pleasantly surprised.Yes, the book is 500+ pages, but I was gripped by the story and the characters. I hardly noticed the length and there was never a dull moment. Ms. Roberts draws you into the setting and the characters lives. Her descriptions are compelling and realistic.And she keeps you guessing!This is my first Nora Robets book, but not my last!"
3,Not as good as her previous books,"An old Nora Roberts fan, I have been disappointed by her more recent books. While they are all fairly entertaining, they are not as good as the novels she was writing before. Northern Lights is a fine book about a man who moves to Alaska to escape some bad experiences. The mystery he has to solve there is dramatic and well-done in a flash-back sort of way, but it is resolved a bit quickly is a less than satisfactory way. Nora Roberts does not write convincingly about his relationship--we are left unclear as to why he falls in love with one particular woman. I find her dogs much more appealing than her herself. The character development is disappointing. You are left with the feeling that there was a lot more she could do in this area. All in all, a disappointing purchase. I don't think I'll bother with her next book"
5,Reminiscent of Stabenow,"Nate Burke is hoping to escape into the Alaskan wilderness, but the former Baltimore cop, now the police chief of Lunacy, Alaska, is surrounded by the eccentrics who cluster there. Trying to recover from the death of his partner and his recent divorce, Nate struggles to understand the close-knit town, while investigating the death of the frozen body found in a remote mountain cave. Unfortunately, the body is the long-lost father of local bush pilot, Meg Galloway, the one person who seems to hold Nate's attention. Things become a lot more difficult for Nate when all signs point to a local murderer, even though the state have written the death off as a suicide."
4,Not really what you might expect!,"I am giving this book 4 stars because I did enjoyed the story. I didn't think this book was a romance novel .........or what most people consider a romance novel to be so that could be good or bad depending on your propective. The story is more about the murder of Meg's father... the lives of the people left behind, and Nate's battle/determination to go on after the lose of his partner and best friend - Jack, with a bit of mystery, suspense and sex thrown in. I think the relationship between Nate and Meg was rushed and needed to be a little more detailed. I know some of the people who have reviewed this book disliked Meg; but I thought she was just fiesty and opinionated and not your typical female heroine. I am a true NR fan and after I finished the last page I still felt like the story ended with alot of questions and not enough answers. If you are a die-hard NR fan you'll like the book ...but ..........don't think you'll love it."
3,Small Town Crime in Alaska,"One of the things I liked most about this book was that Nora Roberts must have spent a lot of time in Alaska or done some extensive research. Her descriptions of the mountains, glaciers, and how the seasons evole was quite interesting to me. Her development of the characters were also interesting. The plot could have taken several turns and the reader was left guessing just who the bad guy really was. I do think the entire story was a bit long and drawn out. The author could have woven an interesting story in less that 562 pages. But, all in all I enjoyed the story of how Ignatious Burke, the former Baltimore homicide cop related to the folks in Lunicy, especially Meg, the daughter of the murdered victim."
4,A different read from Nora Roberts,"I purchased this book, finished it, then read the reviews. I'm glad I did. I do enjoy reading the reviews and base some of my purchases on them.While it did take several pages before I got into the story -because this book was different from many of the stories NR writes. That's what I liked about it.While I've read many of NR books, sometimes they can be pretty much the same. I've liked them never-the-less. So much so, that I will continue to read her books as they come out.I hope NR continues to write more books like this one. It was a good read, what a reader wants in a book. Something different from a favored author."
1,Bora Roberts?,"I used to be a huge Nora Roberts fan, but now wonder what happened to the person who wrote books like the Born trilogy. No evidence of her here in Northern Exposure, which was a total bore. Neither the romance nor the mystery were credible or in any way captivating."
1,Read Three pages,"I regret that I cannot base my review on more of the book. As a person who lives in Alaska, I was unable toread more than three pages of the book before realizing there was very little reality to the story. I like good escapist literature as much as the next person, but the small ""details"" that were supposed to make this story seem accurate were very incorrect. The most glaring one is that most small villages in the Interior (where planes land on frozen rivers) are dry, but suffer from alcoholism as a serious problem in the community. A mayor would never offer a drink to a new person in town just off the float/ski plane. I try not to publish negative reviews, but I feel it is necessary in this case."
3,Alaska...BRRRR,"Pretty good book. Descriptive. I don't really care for romance novels. My favorite female writer is Mary Higgins Clark.I am the author of Domestic Abuse All Sides, Domestic Abuse Our Stories and Murder in New England & Closing the Circle"
5,Enjoyable,"This was an enjoyable read. I love the main characters, i almost feel like I live in Alaska and know what it looks like...I also like the murder mystery, it did not take over the whole story, it flowed easily with the relationships."
3,Northern Lights,"I am a big fan of Nora Roberts but this book really dragged in the first half. It takes place in Alaska with the point of view from a Baltimore cop relocated to Lunacy, Alaska as the chief of police. The plot involves a murder that happen 20 years ago. The main character works his way through the whole town looking for suspects. Not the same page turning narrative that Nora Roberts normally delivers. The second half did pick up some as new murders were occurring but overall I was disappointed in the pace of novel."
1,Didn't Care to Finish,"As a big fan of Ms. Roberts and a former resident of Alaska I was excited to hear that ""Northern Lights"" was coming out. Unfortunatly I got stuck about 1/2 way through the book and just couldn't make myself finish it. I didn't care who was killing of the townspeole and the heroine's family members including herself made me wonder what was in the water supply of the fictional Lunacy. Wait till paperback, or rent it at your local library."
2,"Sorry to say, not her best","I was really looking forward to this book. And unlike some people, I was excited that it was so long, it just gave me more Nora to read. But, this book was a big disapointment. It bothered me that she didn't get inside the female lead's head as much as she usually does. I heard her say on Good Morning America that she researched the northern lights on the internet. I think that made a big difference. When she writes about Ireland, you know that she loves it and has experienced it. I felt like anyone could have written this book."
3,Okay,This Nora Roberts book is not up to par. It took me sometime to get into the book and I did not like the journal entries throughout parts of the novel dating back to 1988. I only liked the main character who happens to be the police chief but that is all. I suggest picking it up at the library instead of making the purchase.
5,Good Story,"Northern Lights was a good story set in beautiful, but cold Alaska. NR described it beautifully. The murder mystery was very good and defiently kept me wanting to read more. I loved the use of Star Wars names and trying to guess which was which. Nate was a good charactor. I liked the small town feel and the secondary charctors it defiently felt like older NR books. Meg's was an okay charactor not completely orginial she felt too much like other NR charactors. Still good thought."
3,A little disappointed.,"While Nora Roberts maintained her ability to write brilliantly, she fell short this time in the characterization of her heroine. Sadly, because the woman was not as likable as past characters I was unable to really be drawn into the story. I loved the Nate Burke character, but the mother/daughter team left me completely cold. I felt like Nate was getting the shaft as far as quality of woman and that was disappointing. There are very few Nora Roberts books that I do not own, this is one of them. I checked it out of the library (which is a rare thing for me to do, I usually just buy), read it and was glad that I had not bought it instantly, as is my normal response to anything written by Nora Roberts. The writing did not fall flat, the two of the characters did, one of them a main character."
3,disappointed,"I'm been an avid Nora Roberts fan for 20 years and eagerly await each and every new book. I found this book to be somewhat of a disappointment, I expect more from her. It's obvious she used the old TV show, Northern Exposure, as a model for this book, and it starts out slow,however, once you're into it, it picks up. I also felt there were too many characters introduced up front and took away from the fluidity. It's a good read overall, just not up to usual Nors Roberts standards."
4,Love it,"This is one of her books that I bought not only the hardback but also the paperback, audio and Kindle."
5,A Must Have,"I purchased this book for my Kindle even though I already own it in hardback because I wanted to have it available to me if I decided to re-read it when I am away from home. This is my favorite Nora Roberts book for several reasons. Although I like most of Ms. Roberts books the characters in this book spoke to my heart and it doesn't hurt that I love Alaska and the unique people who live there. It was, and remains, a very good story of survival and the power of love."
4,Great reading,Good story and having been up there makes it even more real to imagine the setting. Wets your appetite to go there again experience some of the story. A must read in my book.
4,Realistic Depiction of Alaskan Life,"I picked up this book nearly two years ago and finally got around to reading it on a recent family vacation. It was very good and held my interest given my love for just about anything ""Alaska"".I'm not much of a reader in general, and especially not romance type books. Northern Lights, however, captured my interest and had me reading through the 600+ pages in just a few sittings.At first I didn't get the whole 1988 journal aspect of the story, but was happy to see it melt into the overall storyline of Chief Nate and the good people of Lunacy, AK. Well done Ms. Roberts."
3,"Not really big enough for a 13"" Lenovo","Bought this for my 13"" Lenovo x200 (13"" is the diagonal screen measurement; the computer is more like 12"" long). Even though the package says it is for 12-13.3"" laptops, mine is an EXTREMELY tight fit--I have to pinch the zipper together to close it--which is not something I have time for when I'm running out the door or from one class to another. And yes, there are chemical smells coming from it, not terrible, but kinda gross. I'm bummed that it's too small, because other than that, the color is cool, and it seems sturdy and very protective. I would definitely recommend this if you have a 12"" laptop, but would not recommend it for anything bigger.Update: the chemical smells dissipated pretty quickly. I am still using it for my 13"" Lenovo, and although it is a tight squeeze, it does fit and the bubble shape around the corners probably does provide some extra protection."
2,"Great 1st year, followed by nightmare","The laptop is sleek, light, fast and great looking.But what good is all that if just after one year it will start to break down because of a design flaw that leads to overheating of the motherboard? To replace it, if you are out of the factory guarantee of one year (surprisingly convenient timing for HP), you will pay almost the price of a new computer. Which is worthless if you consider that it will be a matter of time before a new overheating.Do not take my word for it. Google this product and expressions such as ""will not start"", ""three beeps"", ""overheat"", etc.The two stars were given just because of the sweet memories of the first year of use. Now they will be only memories because I will never again buy an HP laptop."
4,Knock on wood,Looking at the other reviews I wonder what is different about my laptop. I have had it for 18 months with no problems. I use it constantly for work and internet. I am going to buy another HP laptop for my wife. The dv2000 is exactly what they stated.
2,Broke after 10 months of use,"I bought the dv2000 after noting a good price with powerful options. Now it won't boot up and there was no misuse. Therefore it is a hardware problem. I have also lost all of my data since the laptop will not boot. I will never buy HP again, great prices terrible reliability."
2,Too..too..FAKE!,"I admit that once you start this movie you won`t want to stop, and that the extra features are good, but this seems too fake! Like what are the odds of you having a father who`s running for whatever in England, and is marrying a money-hunter, and never knew about you???I think that if you watch this you`ll agree with me that Byne`s has done much better than this!"
3,Review by Cindy and Annie,"I thought 'What a girl wants' was great. It was not a very dark story but a fun comedy. There was a handsome guy Colin Firth. It was also funny that Daphne was not suited to English high class society.It seemed like everyone was in a struggle. Especially the struggle between Daphne and Clarisa was really exciting because Clarisa was very rude to Daphne but they did not actually fight. It made us laugh. Daphne changed because she wanted to fit herself into English society therefore Ian was disappointed. Finally, Daphne got back to her family and fell in true love with Ian. My favorite scene was when Daphne danced with Henry. I would recommend this movie to my best friends."

4,"Pretty Cute, but...","Th I liked it a lot, except for one huge problem. Amanda Bynes, Daphne Reynolds in the movie, can't act to save her life. With the huge launching of all these new teen actresses that are all the rage now, it makes sense that there's going to one in the bunch that sucks. Well, Amanda Bynes is that one. She was really awful in the movie, and it would have been much better if someone else had stepped in. She was trying to act all cute, but ended up just looking fake. Plus, I really felt that they were trying to take advantage of her all-too-cute body by squeezing her into skin-tight shirts that left absolutely nothing to the imagination All in all, it was a sweet movie though, and I like the fact that she didn't have to change who she was just to please her father. The plot was a little silly though; some aspects of it just couldn't have happened.Oh, and by the way, Oliver James, who plays Ian Wallace, so incredibly good-looking."
2,"Rehashed, Stupid Teenage Blather for the Most Part.","This movie was a genuine bore. There were a couple entertaining pieces here and there...but they only lasted for about a minute. Nothing was particularly clever or funny about it. Peach & Pear were the best characters due to their names alone. Other than that I didn't much like it at all. I actually didn't finish the last half hour or so---and unlike good movies, I'm not sorry about that."
1,This girl wants her money back!,"This movie was so contrived on so many levels. I've seen better acting in puppet shows, although to be fair, it was definitely ""cute"". I wish that were enough to make it worthwhile."
4,Colin in leather pants -- need I say more?,"Moms, this is one teenie flick you may want to sit through with your daughters. Yes, the story is silly, contrived and deserving of every critical barb it's received. But you will get to enjoy the luscious Colin Firth in various attire, including a scene in which he dons a t-shirt and black leather pants and plays an air guitar. You will want to watch that one over, and over, and over ... so go ahead, buy the DVD. If you order it from amazon, it will arrive discretely in the mail and your grown-up friends need never know."
4,"Clean, Fun, girly movie","i have 3 daughters who all love the movie, i'm a guy so i cant give it 5 stars. its a good, clean, fun, teenage movie."
4,Colin Firth. Need I say more?,"What this girl wanted was to see Colin Firth in a film again. However what I got was over a hundred minutes of pure fun. Highly enjoyable fun, at that. As a 'girl' who never knew her father, I can certainly relate to this story line. When I told a friend of mine that I'd seen this film, and had enjoyed it, she said, ""That's a kiddie film."" She was mistaken. This film will appeal to anyone who simply wants to be entertained. And watch Colin. Let's not forget Colin. It was great to see him let loose. Loved those black leather pants, too, Colin. :o)"
5,What a girl Wants,"What a girl wants is a story about a seventeen year old girl named ,Dapne Reynolds,and she searches for her father.Along the way she falls for a guy named Ian and he's a muscician. When she gets there her father is running for some campaign and along the way of that she acts like a clutz or just a fun person and decides she has to change.This is a great movie for everyone at any age. I love this movie it was very entertaining."
4,What a Girl Wants,This is a good movie about a young girl connecting with her father who didn't know he had a daughter. Funny at times and serious but enjoyable.
5,What a girl wants dvd,"My daughter had been wanting this movie for a while and we couldn't find it in any of the stores, she was very excited to finally get the movie. She has enjoyed watching it over and over again."
4,A sweet movie with just a hint of angst,"Colin Firth makes any movie worth watching as far as I'm concerned, but thanks to the super cute Amanda Bynes and just a hint of angst this movie appealed to my kids as well. No, there's nothing really heavy or deep here, but there's enough conflict to keep it interesting and make the movie a great escape for the entire family...and a refreshingly clean one at that."
4,The Best Family Movie since The Parent Trap!,"This Movie is a very good movie! The story is a real nice simple story. The characters are amazing, and the plot is nicely done! This movie is a movie that the whole family can enjoy! Great Cast, Great Story, Bottom Line it is great!"
5,Brilliant!,"More than just a chick-flick....okay, it is a chick-flick, but a very nifty one. Like an onion it has multiple layers, all of which are pleasing and delicious!"
3,What A Girl Wants,"Although this movie was funny, and entertaining, I think that the story was a little innapropriate for a PG movie. I have to say that I was rather surprised by it.I would not recommend this movie for younger children, although I might recommend it to slightly older children."
1,Horrible movie...don't even bother,"This movie was one of the worst I've seen, with a cheesy, overly predictable plot and amateur acting. It also portrays Americans as clumsy and brash and the British as overly pompous and unaffectionate, which was a disappointment. The movie is clearly aimed for female ""teenie-boppers"" between 8 and 12 years of age, and is highly annoying to anyone else who attempts to watch this garbage. Just pass it up and don't waste your time."
3,Typical,"Overall it is an entertaining movie for the casual viewers but it is, like many other Hollywood films, built on too many stereotypes. We start off with a teenage girl who's never met her father but is eager to meet him based on the stories her mother's told her. She is clumsy, loud, but down to earth and, of course, does not fit into the uptight British society. The filmakers absolutely HAVE to make her fall off of the stage in the fashion show and into the lake off of the boat. And of course there has to be an evil stepmom and stepsis who do everything to get rid of her. Too predictable, nothing new in this movie."
3,Not as Humorous as What I Like About You,"This movies mainly about her and her father and is more on the serious side than the humorous side; If your looking for lots of humor w/ Bynes I'd highly recommend ""What I Like About You"" http://www.thewb.com/Shows/Show/0,7353,||1003,00.html Lets just hope the DVD comes out.. But hey if you want to see Bynes in action watch this movie.. Has some occasional laughs worth watching for"
3,About what you'd expect.,"Like many others, I watched this movie only because of Colin Firth. He doesn't disappoint. Well, neither does the movie, because it's exactly what I expected it to be--a teeny-bopperchick-flick. It reminded me a lot of ""The Parent Trap""--except Colin Firth is much more my idea of a dream dad than Brian Keith.It is a cute, harmless movie, and I enjoyed it more than I thought I would. Colin Firth is definitely leading man material."
3,"Nice teen movie, but nothing spectacular","OK, if you consider this to be just a teen movie, then it is fine. I personally thought it is rather stupid and slow moving, nothing too hilarious. However, I was surprised that my 13-year old child liked it, so maybe it just seems stupid for us. It is just aimed at a different audience. Nice British scenery. I liked how Colin played, although I don't think his role required too much mastery. He was just well suited with all his previous roles and image.Anyway, it is an OK relaxing movie that you will quickly forget, unless you are a teen or a Colin fan."
4,What a Girl Wants,"I liked the fact that I could what this movie with my grand daughter with no fear of unnecessary foul language or nude scenes. Need more movies for younger children to watch with grandparents. The movie was cute but a bit predictable. It was entertaining and I would rate it alone with ""B"" movies."
2,Could be worse....,"This movie is definetly not for people who seek any kind of realism in films. I only watched the movie because I love Colin Firth and I think Amanda Bynes is cute but the movie is gag out loud sweet. It contain three things I hated1.) The uninspiring dance scene. I hate Hate HATE when movies deem it neccesary to have every one dance the SAME move at a party. (other that the electric slide or something like that.) I've been to many parties and that has never happened.2.) So strange young girls can just pop up on your doorstep and claim to be your daughter and no blood test.3.) A girl 17 years old, I repeat 17 years old can fly all the way to London ALONE and find her father within like two days of leaving.I found this movie to be too cheesy for words. I can't relate to movies if they don't even try to treat me like I have a brain."
4,A great flick,"This film is wonderfully done! Amanda Bynes is a great actress. Plus, the gorgeous and talented Colin Firth is her father. The plot may be predictable, but it will definently make you smile."
4,This was a really fun movie,"This is about a girl named Daphne(Amanda Bynes) who sets out to find her father, who left them before she was born. But there is a twist. Her father is not just normal. He was a .... I'm actually not going to tell you. Watch the movie. It was really good and fun.Buy it!!!!!"
2,Cliched To Death,"Considering I don't really like Amanda Bynes, Hilary Duff, or the retched Olsen Twins, this really isn't the kind of movie for me. However, I agreed to see it with my Aunt and little cousin for some fun and a few laughs and that's what I got. But if it wasn't for my Aunt making cracks at the movie I just might have barfed, for this is the kind of film that makes you wonder ""Gee, can this story numb my brain any further?""I mean, is there a ""Movie Making For Dummies"" book that the writers followed or something? Come on, you could have added a little more creativity than this guys. Anyway, maybe if you got stoned you might get a kick out of it but otherwise, you better leave it for the Bynes devotees."
1,HORRIBLE,"Frankly, this is one of the worst movies ever made. It has a flimsy storyline, and Amanda Bynes is a complete horror. Her portrayal of the main character was almost painful to witness.I would never in my wildest dreams think of reccomending this movie to anyone I think of as a friend. This movie is absolute FILTH.It is not even worth one red cent."
4,Tall and thin but shapely & lovely legs of Amanda's,"Though her legs are not perfect like Miss Hilary Duff's, Amanda Bynes has very lovely and long legs, that seem to go on and on for miles, she looks particulaly good in mini skirts and short dresses tah tshow off her lovely long limbs. Her legs are almost the main attraction of her, they made her a star. oh such lovely legs, but not exactly perfect and shapely like Hilary's, but oh so lovely, none-the-less."
5,105 Fun-Filled Minutes!,"Last night my teen-age daughter invited me to join her in watching ""What A Girl Wants"". This time I decided to leave the work and watch with her.This film is a charming, modern day fairy tale in which Amanda Bynes plays the role of Daphne, an American teenager whose annual birthday wish is to meet her British nobleman father. Finally deciding that she will have to find him, Amanda sets out to fulfill her dreams. Her successful search lands her right in the middle of upper class British society, an impending marriage and a high-stakes political campaign. From then on Amanda and her father, Lord Dashwood, played by Colin Firth, try to adjust to their new relationship, discern their priorities and, in the process, find their true selves.This light, delightful, film enabled my daughter and I to share 105 fun-filled minutes. Come to think of it, isn't that What A Girl Wants?"
5,good family movie,"This movie was very funny as well as having a lot of heart. It also shows that we all have to make choises, making them with the heart is not as simple as it seems. I enjoyed the contest betwee the snobs and the just plain folks. love thei movie and recommened it to all ages."
4,We Care,"We Care being Whale's debut album and their 1995 release had the surprise hit ""Hobo Humpin' Slobo Babe"" and other great tracks such as ""Kickin'"" and Pay for Me"". The sound is a mix of alternative rock and trip hop. Allmusic and Rolling Stone both gave the album high grades in their reviews. No lyrics are included in the booklet but a photo of the band at the time of the release. 4/5."
2,I'm a hobo humpin' slobo babe,"Damn, that is good stuff. That hobo humpin slobo babe is awesome. It is the greatest song ever. I cannot believe that this song is not on the top of great mass of people screaming songs. that singer is so sexy with those braces while they toss her all over the world. Unfortunately, the rest of the cd is not very good. But if you see it for very cheap, then get it and treat it like a single."
4,"Great bags, great compromise","These bags were used in West Hollywood in their public dog bag dispensers, and I thought they were great because I was using Bags on Board until I learned they are not biodegradable. Dogipot is not 100% biodegradable either-- they simply break down into tiny plastic bits, which might not be good for the environment either, but at least they disappear somewhat. They cost about half as much as a true bio degradable bag."
1,Dogipot litter bags,"did not like the product - felt the bags were too thin and when I 'tossed' one, it ripped."
4,Good for smaller dogs,Worked fine (once you figure out how to open by wetting your fingers) for my 20 and 25 lb dogs. Tough to work with with my 80 lb German Shepard especially if you have gloves on.
4,Great for the price,"These bags are thicker than most plastic grocery bags which is what I use when I run out of store bought bags. They fit my hand well. I have 2 dogs that weigh 70+ lbs and have not had anything too big for the bag yet. I have found cheaper bags (because of shipping costs) but they don't tear as easily and are thinner. So, I will purchase these again."
1,Will not buy this again,"the bottom seam on some of these are not sealed. Something happened to the 2 rolls I got. When I stick my hand in the bag, the bottom easily rips open. Obviously, poor quality control system. Will try another product."
5,doggie bags for the envoronmentally conscious,"These bags are great - discovered by us for our 2 dogs at Sugarloaf ski area, and used exclusively now here at home. They are brown, meaning the contents are not visible as one walks around, and biodegradeable plastic, which means that, placed in a paper bag for disposal at the dump, they aren't buried treasure for the next millenium ! The size is adequate even for big dogs, and they are sturdy without overdoing the plastic content. The easy to use roll is a plus as well."
4,great for dog walks,"they use these bags in the park next to my house so we decided to buy a supply for ourselves. They work great, are strong and easy to use."
4,litter bags are okay,I bought the bags because they are inexpensive. They work well. I've only had one bag tear at the top seam while I was tying it off.... I will be buying morebags when my current order is gone.
1,DULL and Noninformative,"Contained a lot of info used from previous teacher ed. courses. Many of our profs skipped through chapters in the text rapidly, just to say they covered it. Sad that it's used as a graduate level text, it really shouldn't be used for anything above a BA"
4,Textbook for a class,This book was purchased for a summer class. The book was well organized and seemed to fit the purpose pretty well. My favorite thing is the indepth summaries at the end of the chapters. This provided a good way for the students to focus on the important information.
4,Good Connection,This book has a great way of explaing the material. The first chapter was overwhelming but by the second Chapter it was better to comprehend.
5,Tiger Tank R/C,"Great Product. Seriously, it really is great. I study Wars and Military history extensively, and this tank is right on. A very excellently detailed by Heng Long. My advice would search youtube for demo videos before buying, though.The tank as an R/C toy, however, is only decent. The sound, light, airsoft, and smoke are very, very nice, but the R/C functions can go a little haywire when used indoors.This is a very good product a very very low price. I would suggest that if you are looking just for a R/C airsoft tank, get this one. THe Tiger is a classic.However, be sure to check the seller's rating before purchasing. I purchased mine from Amazing Tech Depot, and while the tank was fine, the contents inside were not. The smoke bottle had been opened and was leaking, the bb's were all over, and when i contacted the seller to ask about details, i got a very rude and upsetting answer."
3,Mantlet upside down on Tiger,"Has anyone else noticed that the gun mantlet on these tigers are upside down? Now as to the quality, I would say is is a 3 on the 1 to 5 scale. It represents an early production Tiger however the friggen mantlet is upside down. The gun sights, 2 holes are supposed to be on the LEFT side and not on the right. I am amazed at how this went on for several production runs. Unless you know what you are doing do not try to fix this. It will only make it worse. Anyway have fun out there and try note to freak out the cat."
2,Broke Tiger,Worked great untill the screw came out of the drive srocke.There was no way to replace it without destroying the drive sprocket up.
1,German RC Tanks made in china,The seller of this product will not return emails!!!!!!! Dont buy these models. I have bought two and one arrieved with a broken remote control. This seller will not return emails about a replacement. (within the 15 days of return) Items are not for small children a lot of very small parts and easy to break. Shipping is too high per item $25.00
1,Does not work - i bought two and cannot return them??,"This is a horrible product - i would agree with the previous reviewer. The battery dies after 15 mins, it will not turn or work on carpet - i think the entire line is faulty."
1,"These are bad,stay away from",I bought three of these new and have not got even one to work. What a waste of money. Support for this product is nonexistant. I now have 3 oversize paper weights.
3,"Hebrew Bible is not an ""Old"" Testament","I just purchased the other set because I am uncomfortable learning the meaning of Biblical Hebrew from Christians. We just don't intrepret things the same way.The number of stars reflects being forced to pick one, as I haven't seen them this should be blank."
5,Hebrew Vocab Cards for text book,"I highly recommend these cards if you are using the associated text book. They have helped me study for my class. There are 1000 cards in the box and over half are presorted by chapter, however, I found that a few of the words (about 5) were in the textbook chapter vocab but not presorted in the box. You will probably want/need to create your own cards for things like prefixes and suffixes (about 20 cards)."
3,Really needs an index sheet,"The font is nice and clear, and I really would like to use these cards. We're using Kelley's grammar however and I refuse to shuffle through 1000 cards/chapter. (Okay, sure it would be fewer each chapter ;) ) I've switched to Visual Education's cards, which has a really scratchy font; but at least I can locate the cards via an index booklet. This (index) is something Zondervan should publish in pdf form and make available through their website. Were that to happen I could rate these cards a 5."
1,Unhelpful Card Order,"I found that this product was way more hassle than it was worth. I am studying Hebrew using BBH and thought these cards would be keyed to that grammer since the author's names are on it. However, best I can tell the cards are placed in word frequency order NOT the order of the vocabulary by chapters. Thus, I have hundreds of cards I have to rifle through and sort by chapter myself. Then in the end there are not cards for every vocabulary word in the grammer itself.Do yourself a favor- save time and money by writing out your own flashcards on notecards or paper. This is NOT WORTH IT!"
3,Great cards marred by organizational errors,"I've been using these cards to great effect for some months now in tandem with the Pratico/Van Pelt Grammar (which is very good). They're great cards, with one major problem: not all them are properly keyed to the Pratico Grammar. The cards are organized by frequency, and a few words here and there will have a disparity between what's in the book and what's on the cards. This problem isn't a big deal when you're dealing with the high frequency words (as the jump in frequency will be larger from word to word) but when a rarer word isn't keyed correctly it can be very difficult to find. This oversight is especially infuriating because both the cards and the book are put out by Zondervan. The problem may be due to different editions (I can't think of anything else that would cause it) but it's still unacceptable. The cards are still definitely worth the money, but know that you're going to be getting angry at them from time to time."
2,"Tea: I do believe, after that sip, I'll pass.","Overall, this was another mediocre romance, a story that lacked real depth the characters or the plot.It follows a young innocent girl who is forced to stay at a sort of rival's castle. And as expected, there starts to be some sparks between the rival and the young girl, big surprise there.Interesting idea, it was so very predictable, how the story unfolded, that it failed to impress me or truly grab my attention. Not bad characters though. It could have been awesome, but it petered out as just 'so-so'.It's a light romantic read, and if you enjoy that type of book, this might be just the ticket.Otherwise I'd recommend Elizabeth Vaughn or Kresley Cole."
1,If you like pushy...............,"You'll love the heroine of this book. I didn't. I found the story severely disappointing, particularly since I'd so thoroughly enjoyed everything I'd read by Ms. McGregor both under this name and under Sherrilyn Kenyon. In fact her book, 'Fantasy Lover' is my favorite romance novel ever. This one, however, landed in my trashcan around the time I reached page 90. The hero was sympathetic but dreary and repetitious; the heroine was spritely and sparkly but not very bright. And abominably intrusive. The supporting cast with the exception of the hero's brother is lackluster. The writing felt forced. I don't think even the author liked this one much."
3,Easy Read,"Master of Desire is a fast read and a nice story. The characters are likable, and the heroine is reminiscent of Julie Garwood's historical women (sweet and outspoken in their innocence). It's the typical romance formula: the gruff, unyeilding warrior with no emotion allows the sweet, beautiful, virgin Lady to break down his defenses and give him the ability to love. This story is not earth-shattering or terribly memorable, but it's a perfect book to bring along for a day at the beach."
4,Kinley does it again!,Master of Desire was the second book I have read by Kinley MacGregor and while I liked it - I did not think it was quite as good as Born In Sin which I rated 5 big stars!! Draven Lord Ravensood was another tortured rouge and determined to never allow love in his life. He felt he did not deserve love and when Emily is forced by the king to become his ward for a year everything he ever believed of himself is challenged by this lovely female. It is a romantic tale and I truly enjoyed it. Kinley does have a real ability to bring characters alive and make you really care about how their lives unfold!! I would recommend any book by this author.
2,Didn't finish... dialogue was too modern,"For a historical romance, I found the dialogue, minus the occasionally inserted ""aye"" and ""anons"", too modern. I really expect I could hear people on the street having these same conversations. This was my first Kinley MacGregor and I'm not sure I'll pick up another. I liked the concept she put out there, and I'm always a glutton for tortured heroes, but the dialogue and lack of much forward momentum. I even liked the heroine. I think I would have been able to get through the book if the dialogue hadn't bothered me so much."
2,Same ole' Same ole'...,No luck with this one either...Just the same ole' same ole'...nothing great or even review worthy...Hopefully better luck next time (and considering I bought all in the series BEFORE I read the first one then lets hope they get a little better!)
1,The Master of Desire,"The plot of the book was a good idea, however, it became VERY boring when all you would read about is how much pent up frustration Draven had with his lower body. IT was becoming vulgar. I am interested in the romance of the story not the lust one man has over a woman.Now if you are a reader who thinks that when a man has feelings or ""loves"" the heroine he must lust after her and all the man can think about is sex then this is the book for you.My overall opinion is that it was a great idea, underdeveloped, and WAY to much on below the belt reaction."
3,Eh...,"I guess I've been spoiled by Julia Quinn, Stephanie Laurens and Liz Carlyle, but I was disappointed with this book. All the elements seemed right, but just didn't come together with a story that engaged me. It was shallow and simple, and not all that spicy..."
2,Unreal!,"This was my second book by Kinley MacGregor. I find her writing to be more for the younger reader. This book/story was totally, totally unrealistic and silly, but it was fun. I did smile and laugh. But, I like a higher intellectual, mature story. I won't read anymore by Ms. MacGregor. Added note: She writes detailed intimacy scenes which I like, but without the maturity of the writing/story to go with the love scenes, they are unmoving. You want to be moved - read Madeline Hunter's 3 books that start with ""By......"" they are fantastic mature love stories."
1,Very disappointed with this one...,"I am normally a big fan of Kinley MacGregor books, but this one was such a huge let down. I felt that the characters were weak and the chemistry b/n the love leads was severely lacking. I kept rolling my eyes everytime I read something along the lines of ""I can never have her, but there's just something about her, but I will not allow myself to succomb to my desires."" blah,blah,blah... After reading this basic sentiment for the 20th time, I was thoroughly bored. I was never attached to the characters or yearned for them to come together. I won't be completely negative though, I enjoyed the scene that took place at the Lincoln Fair, but that's about it."
5,Love It,Have read this book before and it is just a sweet story that I can read over and over! Great!
3,cute but very small,"these are adorable letters, but don't miss that they are only a couple inches in size. i returned them because they sent his first letter w/o the other two, but nonetheless wanted letters that were the ""typical"" size you see in stores, about 6 inches."
3,Cute but tiny...,"I had wanted to put this on a wall but did not look at the dimensions prior to ordering. The letter is very small, but quite detailed and will now reside on her nightstand."
4,As described,"I bought letters for my son and God-son's name. The letters have a very good size, dont know why some reviews indicated that it is ""smaller than expected"" as the dimensions are given in the product description. All in all, I really like these letters, they have lovely detail, makes the nursery look very beautiful and gives these kids a sense of ownership of their rooms."
5,Does Anyone Know the Plot of This One?,"I don't know what this one is about, but I will say that the drawing is MUCH more realistic. In all the the new books the covers are terrible, especially Sterling's Second Chance and Christina's Courage. Sterling looks like a Percheron and the tack and clothes are all wrong. Anyway, good job!"
3,Racing Parker-Review,"In this book , Christina meets her old friend Parker at an auction . I think that Parker is wierd . he has no right to take Christina away from her friends . But I feel sorry for him . I wouldent like mean parents . I would hate to leave all my friends ."
5,Kept Me Hooked!!!,"I think Joanna is Doing good work. Most people dont like the romance, But hey, Christina is thirteen, what do you expect! Do you whant her life to be nothing BUT horses! Come on, the girl has to live. I like that Sam is back and also that she's hear to stay. If you like othe r Throughbred books you'll like this one."
1,This book SUCKS!!!,"This book is so stupid! The only reason it got one star insteadf zero is because the only intense part is when Parker crashes on Foxy. THAT'S IT!!!! Christina acts so naive in this story!! IT'S NOT EVEN NORMAL!!! This book sucks, and everybody gets a little stupider just by reading it!!"
3,This book was getting better!!!,"I have read this book ( am I the only one??) and I think that it is a major improvment over the books since #24. For once Christina isn't totally focused on Dylan, and for once Sterling acting up like a maniac because Christina pushes her too hard isn't the plot. Parker, by the way, is the Townsends son. I think, though, that Sammy shouldn't have abandoned racing. But the book was badly titled. Before I saw the cover, I thought it was about racing. But luckily, it turned out OK."
4,Better!!,"I thought that this book was much better than some of the other ones about Christina, but what happened to racing? and Dylan? I thought that the Townsends were supposed to be bad!! In the much earlier books (#7, #8, etc), Samantha says that she'll never be cut out for jumping, and then she just drops racing and becomes an event rider!! JOANNA CAMPBELL, IF YOU'RE OUT THERE, PLEASEEE COME BACK AND FILL IN THE EMPTY SPACES!!"
5,Tucker DVD,"This is a very sad story, but unfortunately very believable and probably very close to the truth.Typical corporate lost souls with their rape and plunder mentality laughing all the way to the bank while the true spirit of America takes another shot to the head. It makes me want a law that imprisons dishonesty, but then...how would the government exist."
3,Solid,"Tucker: The Man And His Dream is a good solid film, but, as Coppola himself seems to realize (in his commentary), it's nothing special. Its stylized realism is appealing, but ultimately an empty appeal to nothing of substance. That's too bad, because throughout the film I was thinking that there is gold to be mined in the old adage that not all who think that others are out to get them are crazy. Trust me, I know. But this theme is not really even touched on in the film, and only glancingly so in the commentary by Coppola, when the filmmaker muses that newer Internet technology likely makes it easier to succeed against the powers that be (no quite so, Francis!). Nonetheless, the cumulative positives slightly outweigh the negatives, and even if they did not, the film's historical focus deserves viewing. Just, keep expectations in line (unlike Tucker) and you will likely find something of benefit, whether or not Coppola intended it or not."
3,A Fun Movie And A Bit of History,"The American automotive industry has quite the history, and this movie tells the story of one of it's forgotten: The Tucker Torpedo. It's done in a very period-esque style, indulging in many styles of the 1940s, from the big band sounds from that era, to the flaky movie style. It's a great movie, and doesn't institute any sex or violence. On top of all those qualities, you will inadvertently learn something.Tucker created a car that would have brought the rest of the automotive industry to it's knees. The Torpedo was a durable good, free of planned obsolescence. This would have killed the industry because it was based on the ideals and morals of the original Model T. The story that unfolds is one of corruption, greed, and back-stabbing tactics that often surround big industry. All the while, the movie entertains and is a fund joy ride through automotive history.Not a 5 star epic by any means, but any movie collection would only be improved with this as an addition."
5,Great American Movie,"This Is a great movie about a man and a dream. Jeff Bridges is awesome,and its really neat how they go from one scene to another.The movie shows what America was about and has been lost.everyone should watch this movie,should be shown in schools."
4,Informative and Inspiring,"While surely a bit Hollywoodized for dramatic effect, this movie by and large sticks to historical fact, and the direction and acting are wonderful. Jeff Bridges and Martin Landau carry the film very capably, creating believable characters who make us care about them. The overarching theme, of an individual pitted against corrupt government and corporate officials, is quite applicable to the present day, and Preston Tucker's story is an inspiring tribute to the human spirit. This movie is well worth a look."
5,awesome movie!!,this is the best movie ever in my opinion. not only does it show the history of the tucker automobile but it also shows how it would have been if you came up with a new idea and what would happen to it. Also in the movie you will see saftey features and things on the 1948 tucker car that are just now in 2009 appearing on cars. again awesome movie!
5,Provocative and inspiring,"Wonderful movie and its stature is bound to increase over time. The movie captures the optimism of the immediate post-war era through its rapid pace, colour and music. At times threatening to succumb to a sense of gloom and foreboding, the movie, like the man, Tucker, never does. It moves from the story of a ""man and his dream"" to the larger issues of innovation and creativity against the protective mechanisms necessary within society. Anyone who works in computer technology today is bound to see parallels."
4,best complete box set of Schuberts masses for the price,"The five cds in this set comes beautifully packaged in carton sleeves in a space saving cardboard box with a thin plastic covering. There are several different performers in this set but they all are good. The sound quality is great although not quite excellent. Everything but the German mass was recorded in 1996. The german mass was recorded in 1975 and is an analog recording, but it sure doesn't sound like it.The instruments are heard loud and clear, but it sounds as though the mic is too far away from the singers sometimes. It is still good though, a much better deal than the vox box that costs almost as much. This one also comes with a few extras and a complete German mass that the Vox Box set seems to lack. It's too bad there are no samples for this one, everyone buys the one with the samples but if you just take a chance on this one, you won't be disappointed."
3,A Mixed Review,"There's a lot of good AND bad stuff in this book. The Latvian Gambit is thoroughly demolished, but the dubious Cochrane Gambit is recommended against the Petroff. Some of the analysis is pretty terrible and some of it is pretty good. I recommend that the reader have a strong program running on a fast computer to help separate the good stuff from the junk. Although I can't quite recommend the book, I can't call it a complete waste of money."
2,Startling Indeed,"This is not a very good repertoire book. For example, the Cochrane Gambit against the Petroff is a joke. The lines recommended after 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bc4 Nf6 4.d4 are mostly favorable to Black (the book is a repertoire book for White). The analysis is full of holes. The author could have tested some of his material against computer programs; obviously he did not. The player who tries out some of these dubious lines against strong opposition will be startled at how fast he winds up in hot water."
2,Not Impressed,"There are songs Mary has done that I really love as well as other albums but this one consisted mostly of a lot of mindless, superficial choruses such as with the song ""Family Affair"" or ""Love"". Most of these songs are filled with a lot of chorus repeats to fill the time and superficial lyrics. Her poem in the last of the tracks tries to make this album seem ""deeper"" than it really is but fails. Unlike her album named ""Mary"" (with songs such as ""Beautiful Ones"" and ""Your Child""), this one is not thought-provoking and lacks power because there are no emotions behind any of the songs. While some of the songs are good for dancing, they're not good for listening to in my home. Skip this album and buy ""Mary"". I can see I probably won't be buying anymore Mary J. Blige albums."
3,Not Bad,"I bought this album on a whim during my lunch break. It's not too shabby. The production is really really hot, tho some of the hooks and lyrics could use a little more polishing. This album feels like a sequel to her debut, or My Life, instead of going in the psuedo-timeless, wannabe Aretha Franklin direction of her last album which I mostly didn't care for. It's also not quite as pop oriented as Share My World was, with more of a lean towards dirtier urban beats and general ghetto fabulousness. While I don't like every track, they do all have a certain focus, if you will, and none particularly come across as being mere filler, which is always nice. Overall, a very solid album."
5,"Mary's Back, and she's still the Queen","Since I bought Mary's previous album ""Mary"" I spent everyday of my life waiting for her next one. And now, after 2 years I understand that every single day was worth of waiting! Of course Mary have changed a lot, but in a good way. Her rhymes became stronger, beats more up tempo, and here voice became even more beautiful. When I'm trying to find at least one flaw in this record, I just run out of words, because this album simply perfect. The highlights are Family Affair, Steal Away, PMS, No More Drama, Forever No More, but there's no better or worse songs on this CD, you'll be listening all of them, and this album worth every penny it costs. Sure it will say new word in hip-hop and R&B music, and it supposed to become even more successful than its ancestor. So lets go celebrating No More Drama in our life and lets get crunk cuz Mary's back."
2,Sorry Mary...this is weak,"After the artistic strength of 1999's MARY, to have NO MORE DRAMA is very much a disapointment. The album caters to the current R&B/hip hop crowd, with some lifeless tracks. The album was even re-released and repackaged with new tracks and a new album cover (which is also awful I might add). There's a few tight joints here, PMS, Family Affair, No More Drama, 2U, etc but there is also some on the very weak side like Rainy Dayz (with that ever so awful and always in your face Ja Rule), Destiny, Where I've Been (feat. Eve), LOVE, Dance With Me, etc. There is almost no soul on this album, and it seems like a rushed project. Please bring the DRAMA back Mary, or come back with a better album than this. You could do much better..."
5,Mary Aint Never Lied!,"Mary J is one of the realist female R&B vocalist ever. She breaks it down and makes you see her world and helps you relate it to your's. I have always loved Mary J since ""Whats the 411""? I love this cd and recommend it to dance to and groove to."
3,Still a work in progress,"While there are some songs on this album that I truly enjoy, most notably ""No More Drama"", ""In the Meantime"" and ""Family Affair"", I think that this album doesn't hold a candle to any of Mary's previous albums. I suppose the reason why myself and so many other fans are drawn to Mary is the way she conveys pain, anguish and eventually hope in her music. Her music really feels genuine. And sad truth is that Mary just sounds better when she is expressing pain.This album just seems so ""busy"" to me, like Mary was just doing way too much with such a limited vocal range. Or maybe I was turned off by the fact that she had way too many collaborations and I want to hear her and not Missy, Eve, the Neptunes, etc. It seemed like Mary's stamp on the album was not apparent except for those times when she mangled the English language. I think Mary realizes as fans should too, she has some talent but still is a work in progress."
2,objections of some track,i want yo know why she objected rainy day featuring ja-rule if possible i need my cope.
1,I'M NOT A FAN,I thinks she can't sing and how ugly she looks. She just screams about her damm boring life on every song. You're no Madonna okay get it Mary J. Don't buy this crappy album.
4,Extra Tracks,"I bought No More Drama the original CD when it first came out because i love mary so much, imagine my dissapointment when Extra Tracks came out! I already have the original CD and now I am missing a few great songs (rainy Dayz, etc..) Im pretty dissapointed, and deffinitly not going to go out and buy the same CD with 2 or 3 different songs!"
5,No More Drama: the perfect soundtk. for post-Sept. 11 world,"Mary J. Blige's latest cd is the best possible cd for those trying to deal with fears, tears, and anger associated with the world after September 11ths horrors.The song ""No More Drama"" is perfect therapy for anyone full of worries. The song ""Family Affair"" is a great coming together song designed to bring together people of ever race, color, and religion. All in all, I have to say this is the best cd that MJB has put out so far. I'm glad that I bought it."
4,No More Drama in Mary's Life...,"I am Mary's biggest fan. I have all of her cd's. This album was good, but I will have to be honest and say this was not her best work. I am still in love with My Life and Share My World. I can always relate to Mary's music whether it is sad or happy. If you listen to the words you will see that she always lets her fans know what is going on with her life.My favorite tracks were #4,#5,#6,#9,#11,#12,#13,#14,#15 and #17. Tracks 12 and 13 really stood out! And ladies didn't she lay it down for us with the song titled PMS?!..."
4,They don't call her The Queen for nothing ...,"Mary J. Blige has a fantastic singing voice. And since the pop music scene is filled with photogenic sexpots who can barely carry a tune, that would probably be enough. But Mary also has a knack for pouring her personal experiences, struggles, and emotions into her lyrics and music, and that's what her fans really respond to. ""No More Drama"" is more than just the title of this album and it's centerpiece song ... it's a manifesto. On this CD, Mary is putting her old troubles and demons behind her, and opening a new chapter in her life: one which focuses on growth and spirituality. Mary deserves the title ""The Queen of Hip Hop Soul"", because she rules."
4,the re-release album is better.,"This is the original release and it's pretty good. The songs they took of for the Re-issue were the weakest songs like ""Destiny"" which is ok but way too long to be playing that riff. ""Crazy Games"" is pretty weak too but ""Keep it movin"" is a good song that people can relate too. However the worst song on the album is Dance for me. What the heck that song is just terrible. Never again should that song be heard! LOVE was a good opener. Family affair is cool 2U was really good. No More Drama WOW! This is over-all a good album and worth buying. The cover is very interesting too! LOL!"
3,good hit records,family affair and no more drama are the only songs I really enjoyed on this CD. Mary is talented and all but as a whole this album is not even as close to good as Share My World and Mary which were more well deserving of grammys.
3,I cannot listen to No More Drama cd,"The only tracks that stand out on No More Drama are ""Family Affair,"" ""Steal Away,"" ""No More Drama,"" and ""Beautiful Day."" This album is ordinary, and I sold the cd. The lyrics could have been better."
1,not for me,"i tried, but i couldnt get into this cd. always liked mary and played out all her cds but not this one. family affair is the only song i even kinda like. i bought it the day it came out so i didnt even get rainy days on my copy. just alot of songs that i dont wanna sit and listen to when im driving or just relaxing. i just dont wanna hear unhappy songs or songs about pms, im just not in that place in my lfe this album just wasnt for me i like feel good music, fun music, love songs, not bitter music and thats the feeling this cd gave me. i highly recommend mary j. blige as an artist share my world is one of the best cds i own, but i will probably never listen to this cd ever again."
4,FANTASTIC!!!!!,"I loved this CD. Especially PMS. That song should be nominated as the woman's national anthem. Keep bringing it the way you do. And I agree, life is too short to put up with drama in your life."
4,Soulful Mary! Loving the new sound...,"I had to listen to it several times and I must say it is very different from her other works and it is very refreshing! I like the new beats and mixes she included are great! I am a lover of music and recognized right away the remixes most artist uses in the songs! I always love Mary's unique style, all I can say is I think she done it again--it's a hit!!!!"
4,Mary J. Blige HAS DEFINITELY ALLOWED US TO SEE HER MATURE!,"I have all of Mary J. Blige's cd's and I have always enjoyed her style. She has allowed those fans such as myself to experience her growth and maturity through music. She has taken us through the journey of ""What's the 411"" in looking for answers to ""Mary"" in wanting us to know that she is Real. Now this cd ""No More Drama"" wanting us to know that ""what matters most is how she see herself."" Of course these are all my personal perceptions but this is what I get from her music. She is tired of explaining, justifying, denying, pleasing people, and all those in the scandalous music industry. She is here for herself first and for you if you've been her shoes, I have. This cd is very motivational, upbeat, funny, and maybe her best work yet.Thanks Mary J. and I hear you girl..............Keep It Moving!"
3,Doesn't cut it....,"I was disappointed in this CD. Out of 17 songs, I found 7 of them to be enjoyable. Of course the standout tracks on this CD are the already popular ""Family Affair"", ""No More Drama"", and ""Rainy Dayz."" The others just did not live up to the hype and power of these three. Admittedly, the ""No More Drama"" remix (feat. P. Diddy) was a good song, and ""Beautiful Day"" and ""Where I've Been"" are also OK. But if you are looking for a CD full of songs that are along the same line as the three hits out on the radio, you won't find them here."
4,DIFFRERNT BUT TIGHT,THIS ALBUM IS QUITE DIFFERENT THAT HER OTHER 4 ALBUMS. NO MORE SAD LOVE SONGS FOR THIS DIVA!! I LOVE MARY........I HAVE ALL OF HER ALBUMS AND I MUST SAY THAT THIS ALBUM IS THE MOST SYMBOLIC OF ALL..BUY THIS ALBUM!!
3,Not exactly bad...,"I have never really been a screaming fan of hip hop and r&b but I do know how to recognize and appreciate good music. I got the CD after hearing the first single off it, ""Dance for Me,"" hoping that the CD would yeild other great songs that had a good beat to them. I was rather disappointed at first. Nothing else seemed to really be catching my ear. Instead, I started to hear beats that were seeming to be the same one with a slight variation on it and lyrics that always contained ""No more drama in our lives"" as a lyric. I figured that I would give it a fair shot though and let it live in my CD player for four entire days and listened soley to that CD. Unfortunately, those four days did not change my mind. It's good for some background music at a party but as for something to get up and dance to, I'll stick to something different."
3,"Borrow, but don't buy","Listening to No More Drama will make you wanna dig up What's the 411? because this album starts off as weak but ends with a few good songs. Dr. Dre wasted a good beat for Mary's ""Family Affair"" and ""Steal Away"" sounds like every other song produced by the Neptunes. However, ""Dance With Me"" will give you some hopes of a happy ending to this album. It seems as if the woman who was dubbed the ""Queen of Hip-Hop Soul"" is now trying to gain her status back, evidently making her sound like a shadow of her former self. Also, if she stayed in the studio a little more, she would have produced better vocals, because on this album she's singing like it's Star Search."
3,"disappointing, but it has it's highlights","This is not a good album at all. the lyrics in each and every song seem so much the same! (""dance for me"", ""dance""' ""no more problems/drama"" etc....) and the tunes aren't great at all! the single ""family affair"" was good and so does the 5-6 first songs, the rest is just boring. In addition mary's vocals can be very lame (for example, the song ""keep on moving"" in the middle part!). However, this album does have it's good points. As i said the first 6 songs are quite good.1. love- nice2. family affair- catchy3. steal away- i didn't like it first but surprisingly it's a very good song! i love it now.4. Crazy Games- i love this song too!!5. p.m.s- loved it first, now i just tolarate it.6. no more drama- gets better in time, and towards the end the song is very beautiful!that's it. if you really want to buy this album give it a listen in the store but start with track 7 to see how bad and not original this album is."
4,I'm a No-More-Drama-Queen,She just get's better and better. No More Drama is my favorite song from 2001. She heals and sooothes. What a great voice.
5,no more drama,"I love this cd, and it sounds great in my car! I didnt think it would, but this cd is tight!"
4,mary keeps it comin,"This album was a great Mary J Blige album, it was upbeat and powerful at the same time. No More Drama, PMS,and Family Affair are the strong points."
2,She is not the 2nd coming of Aretha,She is lucky she's successful enough to afford the best producers...they're the only reason why any of the songs on this CD are any good...I would like her to find a key & stick with it for a while.
1,MJ is aight but...,"I do respect Mary J. She is awesome, but she didn't worth the Grammy for Best R&B; Vocal performance for ""He Think I dont know"", it didnt become a single. It should have been for Ashanti (""Foolish"").You can find her best vocal performance in Love & Life, in the track ""It's A Wrap"" (her 4th single from the album)"
2,"Please Mary, get some drama back in ya life!","Now don't get me wrong by just reading the title of my review. I am a fan of Mary, own all her albums and still listen to them on a regular basis. I am happy that Mary has finally found some peace in her life and has decided to let everyone know. But, dang!, I am or should say was sorely disappointed by this CD. I have only listened to it about 5 times and everytime I've listened to it, I get mad that I spent good money on it. Now, dont call me a hater or say that I'm not a fan, because I am, but the truth is, Mary was in her prime earlier in her career when she was having major drama. Its my belief that pain makes excellet music material, and so does happiness for that matter, but Mary is at her best when she's been down and out. I would suggest passing up on this disc, burning it from somebody or buying it used."
2,I'm glad I'm not the only one that thinks this is bad.,"No offense to Ms. Blige, I've got much love for her, and no offense to you fans, but this album is in no way a good one. Some songs like ""Family Affair"", ""2U"" and ""He think I don't know"" floats my boat, but I must agree with another reviewer, this sounds rushed. Top notch producers, including: Swizz Beats, Rockwilder, and The Neptunes don't shake it up. She's forgiven though, she's only got one bad album in her career."
3,Blender woes,"Really nice looking and strong. However the base seal started leaking and whoever designed the top should be taken out and shot. It works very well in place, however the taking off or replacing of the top requires careful attention and a bit of brute strength."
2,"Good power, terrible quality","I liked this blender quite a bit for about 6 months. Then the thin plastic screw base to the glass jar cracked and the blender leaked. After much searching, I figured out how to buy this little part from Bosch. It cost about $10. O.k., round 2. The blender worked for a couple months and then that same piece cracked again. The problem is that the base of the jar is very hard to unscrew and after repetetive pressure the cheap plastic base cracks. It's a simple case of really bad design and cheap parts. I'm done with this blender."
1,"Looks nice, but stay away","I've had lots of problems with this blender. I've noticed the same funny burning smell that others have experienced, and just recently, the plastic base cracked, and pieces of it fell apart, making the blender unusable. Bosch customer service has been non-existent for me on this."
3,Worked well for about a year...,"...then the motor died. Has to replaced, 'cause none of the two Bosch service providers I contacted would fix it. Apparently, if I find the receipt Bosh may replace it."
2,This could have been a lot better.,"The old school wall of sound firmly drowns out most of the vocals leaving me having to read along, which greatly diminishes the quality of this album. It has a cold icy feeling combined with a dark moodiness, which I appreciate, but.. I need lyrics I can understand."
5,Essential Xymox..,"If i were mistaken Id say this were a Best of Xymox cd...this cd really has the best Xymox songs all on one, even though its just a normal LP. But normal is an understatement,...anyone who likes Xymox must get this, or if you havent heard them...still get this. ""Masquerade"" is my favourite Xymox song...But just about every song on here is great (save the instrumentals, although they are still cool), The only Xymox album almost as good is Creatures...But be aware that after this album came out Xymox started putting out a lot of sh**, so until Creatures (well Twist of Shadows was alright), You might want to stay away from the albums inbetween 1989-1997, those are pretty aweful, too bad. But Creatures is good so maybe they are getting back on track. Just get this...enough said."
3,"Great band and good album, but slightly dated","My first exposure to Xymox was their ""Twist of Shadows"" album which made me an instant fan. This was the second album of theirs that I tried. It's more melancholy and slightly more dated but hey, that's to be expected since it was released in 1985! Melancholiness and 1985-iness aren't bad, they just don't cater as well to my personal taste. But if they cater to your taste then go for it! It's a good album."
4,See above comment on a copy of the same book,It is the same book as Living With Contradiction: An Introduction to Benedictine Spirituality above which I bought for a friend to use in a book discussion.
4,A Good Read,This book gives short meditations/talks about the Benedictine life. This author has another book on this life. I suggest you read that one first.
4,Living With Contradiction,Provides an excellent insight how the Rule guides us on the path closer to God. Brought up some excellent points on living a Christian life that I will apply to my personal life.
3,Nice to own this one in case there is no other available,"The record company should re-release the first two albums instead of holding on to this sampler which does exclude some real beauties. Still, WW even today is a strange brew and it is hard to find a band like them"
4,"DEFINITELY a full-force, hardcore psycho thriller.","I'm surprised. I really am. I expected what one usually gets from a novel such as this: gratuitous violence, gratuitous sex, a sicko psychopath and an author with little or no idea of the actual workings of police, detective and forensic operations.What I found was a very deep and gripping book, fully researched down to the most basic of details, and full, deep, finely-honed characters. I found myself liking each and every character, even the psychopath, for distinct and different reasons.If I admit to skimming some of the more graphic details of the removal of body parts, it is only because I couldn't put the book down and was eager to see how it ended. And what an ending it was!I wasn't aware that there was a genre dedicated to books of this type, but I do know that this has got to be the best of the lot."
2,A Failed Attempt,"Yes, this book is unflinching and daring in it's presentation of real-world style horror. But the characters and events are really sort of...well, stereotypical. No one comes across as fully fleshed or real. Everything is painted in broad, day-glo strokes with little sense of nuance or care. I do see a bit of potential here though."
4,Needle-Work Anyone?,"Portrait goes the extra mile dark psychological thrillers should. Truly a very disturbed mind that is brilliantly detailed throughout every page. Chemical imbalances misfire that will grab your throat with both hands. Gore, torture and insanity spin wildly from cover to cover as Lee and Steffen present fresh new ways to make readers grind down their teeth. She will make you smile and she will make you sick and your going to love every painful moment!"
5,Good....,I got this watch as a gift to my wife. When the wristwatch come; i was very happy. My wife liked it a lot. thanks to amazon and the seller.
2,Smug rather than supportive,"There are way too many negative examples in this book - case studies of what stupid or weak-willed people did wrong, in the author's opinion. She does have a lot of insight into how to build a niche, but she delivers her knowledge with a sharp-edged know-it-all attitude that I could not take after a while. Despite being a marketing consultant who wanted to recommend this book to clients, I could not finish reading the book, I found it so offensive in tone."
5,Brilliant. Loved it. Ordered copies for the whole company.,"Over the years I've collected and read just about every book on marketing and building businesses that is on the market. Some have been very good. Nichecraft, however, is far and away the most insightful and innovative book of its kind I've ever run across. If I'd had this book when I started my business 15 years ago, it would have saved me a fortune in lost time and wasted efforts. One of the best things about this book is its practical step-by-step approach. Dr. Falkenstein lays out her nine-step process clearly and with great style. Her experience comes through loudly and clearly. Although I am a professional photographer and am applying Nichecraft's principles to my own specific business, I can see that it would be invaluable for any business in today's environment. It is so good, I ordered copies for everyone in my company."
4,plethora of ideas and gold nuggets,"Great book with a plethora of ideas and gold nuggets you can put to use immediately to grow your business. I was able to look at my specialty and narrow my niche as well as communicate to others what I do as well as how I can help my clients. Falkenstein takes the reader step by step including worksheets to help you individualize your niche. Competition and economic factors are two obstacles which this book addresses and gives practical methods to eliminate obstacles to success.-Gary Perman, PermanTech"
3,Prodigal Daughter reads about home town,"I was born and raised in Estherville, Iowa, later attended Iowa State University at Ames, and relocated to Florida fifteen years ago. I've always been fond of regional writing and was delighted when my mother gave me a copy of Esther's Town as it featured my home town. Perhaps I, like many, develop more of a sense of sentimentality and nostaligia the older I get; however, I think most readers would enjoy the tales of the strong and brave pioneers of this northwestern Iowa town. The author worked for the local newspaper and knew all the ""characters"" so the authenticity of the book can't be questioned."
2,Disappointing,"I eagerly awaited the arrival of this book. Unfortunately, I found it to have little garden information, pictures which lacked good perspective and a narrative which was weakly written and included only sketchy details. ""Reflections on Pools"" is a much better book."
5,Loved This Book!,"I took a chance and ordered this novel after reading the previous reviews. I was not disappointed. If you love a story and characters that leave you resonating long after the initial read, get The King of Billy Goat Hill. I've read six more novels since and still I keep thinking about Wade, Luke and Mac. I agree wholeheartedly with the earlier reviews, and, yes, this book would make a terrific movie!"
4,Not always sure what the point is,"Most of the stories seem to have little connection to each other or to any theme. Only at the end does it become clear what the effect of any of the earlier experiences are. And the latter half of the story takes time in too large of leaps to really make it's connection to the first half meaningful.However, the scenes from childhood easily stand on their own. One is drawn into the position of Wade Parker quite well. Makes one feel like he is there, with all his young fears."
4,Perfect for a Z1 or FX1 camera and tripod,"Although a little pricey, this carry case is well designed and has perfect room for both your camera, tripod and accessories. It is comfortable to carry (although a little bulky) and looks stylish."
3,Short and simple,"This is up against a lot of competition. Maya civilization has attracted some excellent writers. For an enthralling acount of the decipherment I best liked Michael Coe's ""Breaking the Maya Code."" For a heavy duty textbook if you have time and dedication go to ""Understanding Maya Inscriptions"" by John F Harris and Stephen K Stearns, published by the University Museum of Archeology of the University of Pennsylvania. Longhena's book has the advantage of being short and straightforward. Even such a neophyte as myself noticed innacuracies. On page 14 the number thirteen is mislabelled as twenty-three."
3,Classic drive-in movie theater trash,"This speedsploitation flick was nearly a one-man show for writer-director-producer-star Bill McGaha, who spends the entire film strutting around looking and sounding like a drunk George W. Bush. Speed Lovers offers some of the.worst.acting.ever. (Mind you, I love bad car movies.) This makes the originalGone in 60 Secondslook like an art film, andTwo-Lane Blacktopan Oscar winner. The on-track footage--especially the vintage pit crew action--makes it worthwhile, even if the shots are incongruently spliced together. Were there that many crashes back in 1967? Damn.Genre rating: 3 starsNote: This review is for Speed Lovers only. The sole release available here is a double-feature with 1964's Thunder in Dixie."
1,Where are the robots?,"This movie needs the robots from MST3K. Thunder in Dixie, or Thunder at the Colony 7 near Baltimore, is disjointed and wierd."
4,Enjoyable storyline.,"I hadn't known a lot about the Batman continuity - this book bridges some of that gap wonderfully. Beautifully drawn and well-written, the story shows the trials and tribulations of Dick Grayson as he takes on the mantle of the bat - and a glimpse of Bruce Wayne's reurn - in the end."
3,Oh what could have been.........,"While far from perfect this is what the ""Knightfall"" storyline should have been. Take out the ridiculous character of Jean Paul Valley and insert the most logical choice to replace Bruce, and you have Dick Grayson rightfully stepping into the mantle of the Bat. While Dick's first adventures weren't the most dramatic, his thoughts and actions were great as he feels the pressure of replacing Bruce. His conversations with Tim were fantastic. The inclusion of Two-Face was fitting and paced well. Overall, as with most events with multiple creative teams the chapters were very hit and miss. Overall and decent read and a must for Bat-fans!"
3,Four stars for the band; Two stars for the mixing,"Ah, what might have been. I love Tank but this CD is a bittersweet disappointment. The songs are good and similiar to the first album but what the bleep did they do to the vocals? They are mixed too low and made to sound like the lead singer of Molly Hatchett. I can't even listen to it. I am very bummed!"
5,Great set of knives that last!,"I've been using these knives for almost 3 years now. I sharpen them regularly maybe once a month using theWüsthof 2-Stage Knife Sharpener, and I hand-wash them to prolong their life. I have to say, for the relatively inexpensive cost, these are a great set of knives with wide versatility. I haven't needed any other knife as a substitute for the knives in this block. Highly recommended!"
2,oneida cutlery set,"looked ok, but the blades of the knives were quite rough. Would not want them laying around where children or others might get ahold of them. Thought this would be the perfect gift as I had seen a friends set from quite a few years ago."
1,Bad Knockoff on a great product,"I just received my shipment of ZINO Davidoff with great anticipation of my favorite Fragrance , what a let down when I opened it and used it for the first time. Nothing like the original that I was accustomed to. It wasn't even close! Would not recommend this if you have had the original. I really don't think that they are making the original, just got my hopes up."
1,AWFUL; YOU DON'T WANT TO SMELL LIKE THIS STUFF,"I don't know whether it's genuine or counterfeit, so I can't add anything regarding the controversy among the other commenters. However, I can tell you that whatever this stuff is, it doesn't smell good or masculine at all. It actually smells very effeminate, in fact. What you're probably looking for is something more along the lines of Tuscany Per Uomo by Aramis (though this is sadly also out of production)---something with notes of woods and leather. You don't want this terrible stuff; trust me."
1,Not actually prime (2 day) shipping,"This is a gift for my dad, first off the shipping was supposed to be prime I ordered it on the 9th and it says it will be here on the 16th. So far I am not happy with this purchase at all his birthday is on the 15th and I will be giving him his gift late"
5,Great,"My dad's favourite parfume since, I don't know, forever! He was looking for this parfume in a while, so he was very happy when I gave it to him for his birthday. :) The box arrived intact."
1,Beware of discounted perfumes,I purchased this item at a discounted price and should have known better - it was a knock off - not the real thing. Now I get to return it and reorder the real thing. -You get what you pay for.
4,"Good songs, no staying power","This is an underrated rock album. Rocks all the way thru. Extremely good guitar hooks and songwriting. However after listening to it over time, the songs become kinda dull. Production seems to be a bit dry too."
4,Pretty good mic for the money,"I got it for a locution actually, and it's a very good mic. Could be better with a right preamp though, at least better than mine, but from money/quality aspects is a very nice mic with clear response and even nice looking :)"
5,Bang for the Buck,"This microphone is as good as my previous audiotechnica mic which cost me 200 dollars more... the store where it came from, musicianfriend has other great offers as well and the mic, by the way, was delivered very fast."
5,A favorite for years!,"I love this book! My mother bought it for me years ago and I read it so many times I wore it out! Now, all grown up, I have re-purchased it to read over and over to my kids! An excellent story, well written, and impressive. Not only a great ghost story, scary enough to keep the older ones interested, but not to scary too frighten the little ones, but amazingly it gives you insight into how the underground railroad was run and the desperate measure and danger they met along the way. If you have some kids that are struggling in subjects like history, this is an excellent way to 'sneak' in some knowledge and get those wheels turning! You won't be disappointed with this book!"
5,A great ghost story for kids...,"Sixth-grader Nina Tanleven and her friend Chris spend a summer in the Catskills, as Nina's architect dad restores a historic old inn. The two friends - who have experienced ghosts before - soon realize a young Confederate soldier's spirit hovers about the property.While they are intrigued, simply wondering why a Confederate soldier would be so far up North and why his spirit is unable to rest, someone else - living and deadly - is following the girls, wanting to keep them from finding out the truth.When she's not out hunting ghosts, 11-year-old Nina is just a regular girl. Abandoned by her mother at a young age, she and her dad are particularly close, and tomboyish Chris proves just the right companion for her adventures..."
3,What a Shame,"This has to be the strangest computer book I have ever read, the book should have become a classic as an introductory text to the Ruby language. This book has a great layout and format. The author(s) present the language through a series of case studies that help put the various elements of the language in an understandable context. It is apparent that the author(s) have a deep understanding of their subject matter. So what's the problem? The author(s) obviously speak English as a second language and the book was not edited. This book appears to be a first draft that was slapped together and shipped. The editors (Ben Ryan, Kathryn Malm, Pamela Hanley and Brian Snapp) should look for another line of work. 5 stars to the author(s), 0 stars to the editors. Too bad this book wasn't published by O'Reilly."
3,"slow-paced intro to a wonderful ""agile"" language","May be good for total beginners, but very wordy and repetitive presentations of basic concepts. I really wanted to like this book, but it's poorly edited. Disappointed at Wiley, it has more of the slapped together feel of one of those doorstop publishers (without the bulk). If you've ever programmed in perl/python, java, C, you won't learn much from the first 100 pages. The sections starting with exceptions are worth reading, however, with useful code examplesAlso, there are some bad typos, in regular expressions, they've confused $' and $`."
1,Don't even read this book,"Don't even read this book, it will actually damage your understanding of Ruby and programming in general. I looked at it, not as a master Ruby programmer, but someone with a long, deep involvement with programming and writing who wanted to see how different authors approached Ruby. Jim Haung's blistering review is an understatement: the author had no idea of what he was talking about, the author may have had trouble with English as a second language, and the Publisher's editorial process not only failed, it could never have happened. The work is an intellectual toxic spill that can only be handled by professional Ruby programmers and computer scientists wanting to grasp deep human misunderstanding."
5,Hands-on Basics,"This book provides a good introduction to the Ruby language for anyone looking to understand its basic features. The approach was very practical and hands-on, with helpful examples throughout. A good way to get started with Ruby."
4,dark portrait of the human toll of ambition,"I pulled this book off the overstock pile and was immediately absorbed in it. WHile it is not a scholarly treatment with footnotes, etc. - it is from essays Wills wrote in Esquire - it is a very humane inquiry into what ambition and power cost the Kennedys.Wills makes one of the most cogent arguments that that family, so obsessed as it is with winning at any cost, is in fact hiding sickness and brutalities from outsiders. The story is indeed sad, as Wills concentrates on the lesser known characters in teh drama, such as Ted K's ex-wife, who was temperamentally unsuited to compete with this gang. There is no doubt that this is one side of this remarkable political family. To his credit, Wills does not let his political predilections intrude too much, but instead explores them as real people.As always, Wills' writing style is beautiful and flowing, a true natural talent. Warmly recommended."
1,Not all of it is factual,Based on the recent declassification of the Kennedy White House Tapes. Some of the material about Kennedy in this book is based on false information provided by those within the Kennedy circle. I recommend reading more recently published books for a more truthful account of Kennedy.
1,STAINs! DO NOT BUY! NOT WASHABLE,"Do not buy. This paint is like a dye that stains skin and tables, floor, anything. It is not WASHABLE (read the fine print.) Don't make the same mistake I made by using this product. NOT FOR KIDS. Wil even drip off a dry paper and stain a large area."
3,not very shimmery,I was very disappointed in the product as I do like the dot painters. There is really very little shimmer. The silver is just grey and the gold is just yellow.
2,Boring,My grandgals don't play with it.There is nothing to do but dot-dot-dot.I thought it would be a little something different but itdid not go over.
4,Not much shimmer,The paints are great but there isn't much shimmer. The paint doesn't have any shimmer until it dries. The colors are bright and vivid and the sponge tops are a good quality.
3,love the dots - sad about the shimmer,"We love the dots, we color with them quite a bit. No problem with staining. In fact the puppy got a tube and made a big mess and it didn't stain. But there isn't much shimmer, glitter, or sparkle. Disappointing about that part. Just get the regular colors."
1,"The paint stains on hands and clothes, not washable!","I purchased this for my daughter and the paint stained all over her hands and clothes. I tried to wash it off, but it was impossible. Moreover, it stained on my table and took a while to clean it off. I do not recommend."
3,not pyle pro.,K so i open the package n this was not a pyle pro 15. so i go to return it n u need to print off a return label um i don't have a printer. so i kept it hooked it up sounds great would like to order another one but the shipping is no longer free n its not worth 31 dollar shipping. totaling 115 or something. just not worth it.
4,Value for your money,"Gives you the bass you need for a house party. A well built subwoofer, would recommend to anybody who is looking for bass but is on a budget."
4,You can improve the sound,"Had been looking at these speakers for several weeks and could not pass up the deal on Amazon. Paid $81 each and shipping was free. Hard to go wrong at that price. Was a little hesitant though, as I could not find many reviews on these. When I set them up with my Yamaha DJ equipment, they did add more base but was not totally pleased. Then I read about adding an Aphex Aural Exciter with Big Bottom. Found a good deal on a used one and when I hooked it up to my system with the subwoofers, they REALLY came to life and now sound more like subwoofers that cost hundred's of dollars more. If you buy these and are not totally pleased, try adding the Aphex Aural Exciter with Big Bottom, and I think you will be very pleased."
1,be carefull!!,"hello, i recently bought this item (12-29-09) and it arrived quick, but the major problem was that it had something loose inside and the woofer sounded very low, it turn out that a part of the crossover was broken and the woofer was blown. so please be caustious when you order the item, other than that the cabinet is nice looking (i replaced the speaker) and it sounds GREAT not too large nor to little"
3,loud but not that loud,i got a 1400 watt pyle amp powering it and its just okay. i am used to the bass in the trunk of my car... this does not compaire. i do however have a $1000 subwoofer system in my car.... but i was expecting much more bass out of this thing. oh and i completly forgot!!!! upon delivery i plugged the speaker up and it did not work. i picked up the speaker and felt somethign rattling around. probably the crossover or something.... so i emailed the seller and they were good about getting me a new one after i sent the broken one back. the seller got the first one to me quick so as long as it isnt broken upon delivery this would be a pretty sweet deal. but again i was expecting a bit more ground shaking bass
5,great product,guys this is a really good deal good for the money . just make sure you have a good amp thats it ..
3,Pyle PASW15 Subwoofer,I recently purchased two of these subwoofers and both were packaged nicely but one of them had a scratch on it which doesn't bother me at all since I am a mobile DJ. I hooked these up to my pyle 1000 amplifier and they sound pretty good except you can still hear some of the words coming out which means that the crossover isn't truly a crossover. Also the grill rattled a bit. Overall I would recommend them but you will have to go out and purchase a crossover which any DJ should have except I just started out upgrading my equipment.
2,Cheaply Made,"I had ordered 2 of these to add to a DJ setup and I do realize that they are cheap and all, but when I went to test them, one sounds great and the second one sounds like trash! It sounds like the woofer has ""popped"" and will need replaced."
5,Good Product,Great and resonable for beginner DJ. The 15inch woofer rocks with the right amount of amp power put to them.
3,took a chance and i'm satisfied,"i was very skeptical about pyle and such a low price, but i needed to downsize my mobile dj gear so i took a chance. price aside, this thing had to fit in my corolla along with my mains, rack, etc...i've been using mine for about 18 months at about 60 gigs a year.the sound isn't great but at 1/4 the price of a berhinger (nevermind qsc or jbl) i cant complain! i've never pushed it too hard but it's been adequate for small halls (3000 sq/ft). i'm running it @470w one one side of my ipr3000 and i KNOW i would blow it if i gave it full power, so i'm always cautious. i'm actually going to buy another to supplement for larger rooms.it's small and lightweight, but the construction isn't too good nor is the quality of the cab. there is an internal crossover, but i opened it up took it out and resoldered the jack.overall, it's slightly better than decent."
5,My Favorite Dash,"Get You Some of Me came as a huge suprise. I hadn't heard anything out of the band since Tiger Town, their 5th record. I knew the band had been through a line-up change, but since I moved out of Louisiana, I hadn't been able to keep close tabs on their status.Get You Some of Me is most reminiscent of Dash's second album, Ace of Clubs, in that it features a variety types of music, all quintessentially DASHesq. There are a few songs with goofily ill-advised lyrics, but overall Get You Some of Me has become the record I go to first when I'm jones'n for some DASH. Where else can you get punk, country, blues, ragtime piano, and disco all in one package."
1,Too much left unsaid,"I must disagree with the previous reviewer. While I respect the friendship between these two former foes, and find hope in it, I feel that so much is unsaid in this book that it becomes revisionist history. What tips the scales for me is the letter from the Japanese pilot to the author's granddaughter (and indeed, I find the book's letter format to be a precious device, but that is just my opinion). I don't have it front of me now, but it says words to the effect of ""ours was a small, poor country, and so we had to go to war."" Quite a statement about a nation that inflicted unspeakable acts on the civilian populations of Korea, China, all of the South Pacific, and also on POWs--not to mention that unprovoked attack on Pearl Harbor. It is a disservice to write half-truths to readers of any age."
4,my son loves hot wheels,"Hot wheels are one toy that has not changed since I was a kid, now my son loves them. All he asked for was the ""mystery hot wheel"". The only difference is you cant see the actual car. He loved it!! The surprize of not knowing what is was was great."
2,"Think ""Inside-the-Box"" Textbook","It is disappointing that we teach and are taught with such uncreative, mind-numbing texts. If you want to peddle institutionalized, professor-manufacturer's, buy this, read it, and believe it."
4,By the steps into the Holy Land,"The book is very interesting and contains a lot of material from the Israeli historian point of wiev. N. Schur argues that the French historians are disregarding the eyewitness' material and accounts of the events. However, the author disregarded the military structure and organization of the French Army of the Orient - there were no brigades or regiments back then, but always demi-brigades by regalement of 1794; the rank colonel been restored by Napoleon only in 1803, and so on. When citing the magnificent work of la Jonquere, it is always good to check additional references, and specifically the articles published by the French military historian Rigo ( in various issues of Tradition or Uniformes magazines)."
4,beginners guide to modern spiritual thinking,"I should have bought stock in this publishing company. I first read this book in the late eighties, I enjoyed reading self-help books and I thought that this was just another example of that genre, it's much more than that, it can be thought of as a beginners guide to modern spiritual thinking. I was so impressed that I have brought copies for my children (5), my sister and brother (2), nieces and nephews(6) and a large number of friends (??????) I still purchase copies now and then for acquaintances who show budding interest in spiritual matters. It's not just the book itself, but the other thinkers that you are introduced to, at the end of each chapter there are recommendations for further study or reference.The big mistake that most people make is that they think that this is a, ""How to Get Rich Manual"" and it isn't. It is an introduction for people who wonder at the complexity of life and try to understand their role in it."
4,Hits the spot,"This book is a good combining of New Thought and Law of Attraction. As with any book like this, it may be eye opening for some and not speak at all to others. But it has given me several insights and epiphanies.I heard of this book just recently when I purchased a CD by Kelly Howell called The Secret Universal Mind Meditation (which I *love*). She explains that the meditation is based on Anderson's works so I got this book. I do recommend it and will be reading his other books as well.The reason I only gave it 4 stars is because some of it is a bit dated, as it was written in the 50s. Also there are arguments that were probably needed in the 1950s to convince or persuade people of the validity of what he was saying that aren't really necessary today."
1,not for a christian,"The title draws you in but the more you read you feel something is wrong. When I thought I knew where he was going I went to the back of the book and confirmed my thoughts. I ""Am Not God"". I was ashamed I had purchased the book."
1,"old time language, convoluted writing style","I bought ""The Three Magic Words"" by US Anderson because it was chosen by the book club to which I belong. I wish I had not bought it. The author's writing style is convoluted, patriarchal and exclusive. It is all about men. I haven't read a book like that in over a decade and had forgotten what it was like to read a so-called metaphysical book that excludes half of the human race. Also, since his book was written so long ago, he has nothing new to say. I consider reading this book a waste of time. Other authors, like Wayne Dyer, Caroline Myss, Bruce Lipton, Dawson Church, David Feinstein and Donna Eden and Robert Schwartz just to name a few, are far more informative and their writing style is easier to digest. Anyway, that's my opinion."
2,I've read better written children's books,"Maybe I'm just not ""deep"" enough but quite frankly I found this to be one of the most convoluted, poorly written books I've ever read. Further, the whole book can be summed up with a bumper sticker: ""Think Positive"". Repetitive and at times nonsensical, it repeatedly includes unsubstantiated stories of people who have used their subconscious to do the impossible (""A woman who didn't know a word of Greek ran into a room and told a man in Greek that his wife had died"" Really? Where? When? Where's the proof?) One could argue that the Bible does the same thing but I didn't buy the Bible, I bought Three Magic Words. Irritated, I just put the book down but not before skipping to the end to find out what these Three Magic Words were."
5,Do you REALLY WANT to command your world?,This book is awesome! I absolutely love the meditations at the close of each chapter. You will be blessed immensely!
3,Good title,New Thought title that presents what worked for Mr. Anderson on his spiritual journey. The New Thought Movement is more about the manipulation of the mental over the physical rather than tapping into our spiritual resources.
5,Enjoyed this book very much,This is a good starter book for someone seeking an understanding of how to create and change your life. Lots of great affirmations.
5,Three Magic Words,"The is the most amazing book I have ever read! While it is dated, the principle espoused by USA is even more provable by science today. Furthermore, USA's 3 magic words have the potential to bring you everything you ever wanted. Life will never be the same for you after reading this most amazing book. Sincerely, Gary B. Green JP ..."
5,One Step Closer to God,"I came across this book by accident, it has been my ""Bible"" ever since. If you want to be a more ""Spiritual"" person, this book points you in the right direction. Just read the first chapter ""The Lock"". If you don't like it or it doesn't make sense, just put it down and don't read it. However keep it handy, maybe your just not ready for it. One day you will pick it up again and start reading and everything will finally click. It may be a month from now or it may be years from now. When that time comes, that is when you will really appreciate this book. If your looking to be one step closer to God, then this book is for you."
5,"Loaded with wisdom - ""Magic"" has little to do with it.","The title doesn't nearly tell the story. Don't be confused with the word, ""magic."" This book has wisdom and revelation on every page. I am convinced the writter of this book understood what prophets of old were trying to tell us. After reading this book I had clarity on who I am and Whose I am. Read it, too, and you'll experience the connection and come to know unity."
5,Reading for Your Soul,"If you are on the ""path"" to have an explanation to everything in your life, look no further. Bring your whole self into this book and discover your truth. Read every word, absorb every tiny essay, reeducate your body, mind and spirit. The last pages brings the Magic to light. The last three words tells the Secret. Very Powerful and Empowering."
5,A book that MUST be read!,"There are few books that MUST be read to learn how to manifest your desires. This is one of them. Wattles The Science of Getting Rich is another.The 3 magic words is one of the best written and delivers.If you have not read Think and Grow Rich, read it, and if you have, here is a great new edition that I found out about on a course:Think and Grow Rich: The Personal Study EditionIt is worth it's weight in GOLD!"
2,Three magic words to hoplessness - is that really all there is????????,This book did not make me feel better. It took away any sense of hope I felt about life and left me almost suicidal. I am not God. What an aweful thought that my frailty is all there is. If this is not what the book was meaning then it did not do a good enough job communicating it's true meaning.I would not recommend this book to anyone and will be tearing the pages up before trashing it.
3,is ther a God,"This book scared me into believing that God may be the universal unconscous, and not THE DEVINE ENTITY I WANT GOD TO BE"
3,One Error I'd like to bring up,"Obviously it's very easy to go on about this book forever, but I will just mention one thing Mr. Andersen says that is so very out of place.In the chapter ""Love"", Andersen quotes the following, which is supposedly what the Buddha said: ""Love is all, God is love.""Big mistake. The Buddha, no matter what school of Buddhism you look at, did not mention the existence of a ""God"". Buddhism does not even hint at the notion of an all-powerful being.If anything you've heard about this book has aroused your skepticism, add this glaring error to it."
3,haven't read it yet.,"I have to at least get it three stars, because I bought this book... I'm into Self-Help books and so on, so I came across this book with pretty good reviews, so I purchased it... I will let you all know my other decission after reading, lol..."
1,What ?,I could not get past page twenty five of this book. More words for the gullible to consume as far as I am concerned.
1,Embarrassingly POOR edit.,"I LOVE this BOOK!!! In fact, I think this is my favorite book to read when I want to re-center and reconnect and remember that thoughts make things and we create our reality. And I love giving this book as a gift to people who are looking for a change in their lives or wanting to grow.BUT, this new publishing of Three Magic Words is so full of typos it is embarrassing. The large shape of the book makes it hard to hold and read and the typos really diminish the powerful intelligence and divinity that the words contain.I suggest any buyers try to find an earlier publishing of this book, before amazon and createspace got it's paws on it, so that you are not distracted by the amateurish print job."
2,Meh,"I'm not entirely sure why this frame is so expensive. You can get frames for 30 bucks cheaper at other stores for the same quality. I would have gone with one of those if I could have found what I was looking for in silver. This thing is nothing special, and other frames typically have a hanger on the back of the cardboard. This one doesn't. I think you're probably supposed to use the clips that hold the board in, but getting it centered is kind of a trick."
4,"Great! Title should be ""Guide for AVOIDING Wine Snobbery.""",This witty little gem will guide the aspiring wine enthusiast past the pretensions of wine snobbery towards an informed appreciation of wine. It's a beginner's primer that will save the reader from the occasional social faux pas and knock the real wine snobs down a peg
5,Learn about wine (or just how to pretend to know about wine),"Hilarious. This book will teach you all the rules you'll have to follow, and all the affectations you'll have to take on, to pass as a wine snob. At the same time, though, you'll really learn about wine. This book was first published in 1981 and it also offers a glimpse into gourmet snobbery before good food was democratized and celebrity chefs took over. The illustrations are just as funny as the prose and they will both remind you of real wine snobs you know. Every aspiring wine connoisseur should read this book."
4,Charming,"Quite amazing this is seen so rarely. The music is wonderful with some blockbuster arias but not as memorable as La Boheme or Madama Butterfly. I absolutely love the 1920 setting...but a kept woman theme seeking romantic freedom from her stodgy benefactor can be transported to any century. I believe Gheorghiu and Alagna make a fine romantic pair with darn good acting. Not the best soprano and tenor of the last generation but more than adequate. I found Lisette adorable and a fine singer...but her lover Brenciu I found weak at times. The most disappointing person in the cast was Ramey, who sounded out of tune and discordant even shaky at times. The picture quality and sound were great as were the subtitles and staging. What I really appreciate is the MET HD series at the movie theatre. If I had not seen this opera at the movies I never would have considered it. Worth adding to you library."
5,"""Then let me go...""","The only thing I could start off by saying about this movie is: Remarkable. You find comfort, hope, insecurity, and a whole other mesh of feelings and emotions in this movie. You find Astrid (Alison Lohman, Matchstick Men) who is raised to be against anyone who isn't her mother. But she finds herself in a situation where she must learn to adapt to others, and find out..not everyone is the enemy. She meets a string of new people throughout the new phases of her life. All of which are very different and teach her so much about herself. (All in different ways of course..)This was definitely Alison Lohman's best performance, and a breakout role for her. Other great performances were that of Renee Zellweger, and Robin Wright Penn."
4,Powerful movie!!,"This is a powerful movie.I felt the misery of the main character, Astrid (wonderfully acted by Alison Lohman)the whole movie. This is definitely one of the better dramas out there. I was a bit let down by it's Hollywood ending, but Michelle Pfeiffer's incredible acting helped selling it. A must-see for every drama fan."
5,"A beautiful, haunting movie.","Pleasantly suprised by this flick. Don't believe those who put it down. It pulled me in for 2 hours & wouldn't let me go. Beautifully filmed in parts... exquisite opening sequence leading from Astrids bedroom to an LA rooftop at night.Michelle Pfeiffer is perfect, as is the rest of the cast. My only complaint is the underdevelopment of the story leading to Barry's murder. Ironically, the director notes in the film's commentary that an additional 40 minutes of material had been filmed related to the Ingrid/Barry relationship, but Warner Bros pushed to trim it. UGH! Sometimes studio execs don't know best.... Too bad they couldn't have included these scenes on the DVD.Anyway, a beautiful movie, check it out."
3,Book is Far better,"I was throughly disappointed in this adaption of a extrodinary book. I expected because of all the exceptional actresses in this movie that of course it was going to be great. So many key elements of the book were left out. It is absolutely one of the best books I have ever read. The movie could never exert all of the powerful emotions the book does. Don't buy the movie, just go read the book!"
2,"Read the book, skip the movie","The movie doesn't come even close to the raw truth documented in the book. If you really want to understand Astrid and the story's uplifting ending, you must read the book."
1,boo! read the book instead!,"This painfully boring and mild screenplay leaves so much to be desired. It's slow. It just doesn't come close to the drama and emotion of the book. Left out are so many of the foster homes- some truly defining moments of Astrid's life. I was so excited to see the movie- but i had to watch it in 2 sittings - it just wasn't riveting in the least. A lot of the acting is forced- it seems to be they hurriedly filmed this just to get it out in a timely manner, ignoring art- except they did make an attempt to make it interesting with the ""blair witch""-like cinematography (the shaky camera, etc.). Which shouldn't have been so noticable.Take the time to read the book."
4,"a captivating, and pretty good film...","which even though it offers nothing new has some memorable performances,and touching moments.this movie tends to get a bit trite, and fails to live up to it's full promis at the end, but I think it is nonetheless a touching and enjoyable film which can be watched over and over again."
3,"Movie OK, Book Was Better","Maybe I'm biased because I loved the book so much, but this movie just didn't do it for me. So much of the book was cut out that the story wasn't as powerful as it should have been. Also, I thought Renee Zellweger was horribly cast as Claire. However, Michelle Pfeiffer, Alison Lohman, and Patrick Fugit were wonderful.Bottom line: If you really want to experience this powerful story, read the book."
1,No...,"This movie was a chore to watch. They took all the emotion from the characters in the book and butchered it until it was completely unrecognizable. They cut out some of the best parts/characters, and then they squished the rest together to fit it into a film. Don't waste your time with this one."
1,awful!!,"if you've read the book and loved it, do not see this movie!! They cut it up so badly you wont even recognize it. They left sooo much out, things that needed to be there in order for the story to retain its integrity and just simply to make sence. Here the characters fall flat and are 2-dimensional,and the storyline is silly and incoherent. I really enjoyed the book and I dont expect the movie to be exactly like the book, but when they cut out a third of the novel, you kind of wonder did the people who made this movie understand what the book was really about?"
3,2.5 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:As breezy as it is forgettable, White Oleander engages the viewer in its story of foster homes and relationships but never makes anything substantial out of its plot or characters."
5,Wonderful!,"This is truly a wonderful movie! I just watched it today, I walked out of the movie theater feeling as if I had been watching real life, not a movie. The acting was SOOO good! Alison Lohman (Astrid) does the greatest performance I have seen all year! She is so talented! Michelle Pfeifer (Ingrid), wow! Her glares send shivers up your spine, proving once again that she is one of the greatest actresses! During the movie I was thinking that Alison Lohman's performance should win her an Oscar, and then I came home and read reviews on this movie and found I was not alone. Almost all the reviews I read raved about her performance, it really is something to rave about. All in all, this is a REALLY great movie if you like dramas, and if you don't then at least see it for the fabulous acting."
5,A Great Movie,"This movie is a great movie, although I believe it didn't get the credit it deserved. This movie is also more of a chick flick to watch with you frieds, not you husband/boyfriend/brother (basicly any boy)"
2,Very Disappointed,"First off, did everyone read the book. I did, and it was a great book, very detailed, loved it. Maybe it's just me but I wanted to see all the characters from the novel. Everyone and everything Astrid came in touch with. She didn't even have the scars on her body from the dog attack, which was very significant to the story. You never got to see how Astrid grew up with all the moving around, it was mentioned in the movie, but it wasn't even the correct amount of times. I gave it two stars only because Pfeiffer played her role perfectly."
3,"it was only ""o.k.""","I think the point of this movie is to show 2 things (1) how your kid can grow up totally different without your parenting (2) just how bad broken home/ foster care really is. IT was a good movie, but it was a bit slow to get to the point, and really didnt have the ending I was hoping for. It also at times was very far fetched: like her moms power over people, the jesus love'n gun happy wife, the suicidal lady, etc."
3,Fair to Good,Arrived as advertised but I was not permitted to make an exchange when I realized I had ordered the wrong version. Very disappointed.
2,Loved the Book? DON'T See This Movie!!,"I give it two stars because it's a decent film. BUT, I absolutely love the book and this movie deviated from it. I don't feel it did it justice...pretty disappointing, really."
4,"Good movie, better book","I liked this movie, which I watched before reading the book, otherwise I probably wouldn't have liked it as much. If you have read the book and have not seen the movie, then be prepared that about 2/3 of the book is omitted from the movie version. I felt like there were some pretty important things left out of the movie, most notably the number of foster homes in which Astrid lives (she lives in six in the book, three in the movie). I read some reviews that said the movie is very close to the book, so I'm wondering if those people actually read the book. I do recommend this movie, though, because it is very well-acted and, like I said, what is taken from the book is closely adapted in the movie. If you have not read the book, though, then I recommend reading the book, which is a wonderfully written story that may be a little dark and depressing at times, but is very real."
3,Only part of the flower,"If you haven't read the book, you may very well like the movie. It remains an MTV video of a very fine, albeit very self-conscious book: all fits and spurts, without getting into the characters' motivations, flitting from circumstance to new scene, without developing a rapport with an audience. Other than the actress playing Astrid, the protagonist, and an intereting character turn by Robin Wright Penn, the acting was wooden, esepcailly that of Michelle Pfiffer, who lacks the strength to show the love/hate disfuntional relationship her character forges with her daughter, who is shuffled from home to home, searching for a sense of normalcy and seeing only chaos. Read the book OR see the movie. I closed the book thinking of all the characters and flaws and heartaches, realtionships,and their needs and motivations; a fine study of the dysfunction in a person's life taken to extremes. I left the movie thinking it was better than watching the Angels lose."
2,Better as a book than it is a movie?,"Based on the best selling novel of the same title (which my girlfriend loved), WHITE OLEANDER is a film about the problems a young girl named Astrid (Alison Lohman) faces as she is bounced around in a series of different foster homes after her mother (Michelle Pfeiffer) kills a man in cold blood.I'm a movie fan not a book fan. But I can see where this would have made a better book than it does a movie. There's way two much ground to cover in two hours. This story needs a background and we need to understand ALL the characters and in the film we don't. Good performances by Alison Lohman (in her debut I believe), Cole Hauser (PITCH BLACK), Patrick Fugit (the ALMOST FAMOUS kid), and Renee Zelwegger (JERRY MAGUIRE) though. Fans of the book may want to check this out just to see what they think could have been done differently. I know my girlfriend had plenty of opinions of her own."
1,Tedious tale of a totalitarian state,"Mary Fulbrook's review of the former East German state misses the point totally. It is too longwinded, bogged down in detail and fails to underline the major key principle, that the GDR was loved by over half of its population despite what the Western media would have us believe. Having spoken to former East German citizens, the book seems to be too concerned with the origins of the Soviet satellite state and doesn't address the issue that most East Germans were content with their state. In all, I found the book overpriced, badly researched and most disappointing."
5,"I didn't know anything about it until I read it,","The truth is...In early July I went to see my dentist.We talked a little bit about health,the he asked me if I believe in miracles.I told him I did. Then he said he wanted me to read The Book that his dad lended to him .and the BOOK is Love,Medicine and Miracles,translated into Portuguese and I have a difficulty to understand so I visited the site and decided to once for all all 4 books...The books ( I only received 2 of them ""Love, medicine... and ""Peace, Love and..the books are my inspirations to live and overcome any health problems!!AND see life more colorfully."
4,Headphone with microphone,"I bought this headphone mainly for speaking with friends over the Internet. This is a convenient device that allows me to move about a few feet around while speaking. A desktop microphone does not allow me to do this unless I take the microphone with me, which is not practical.The sound quality is very good for the price. I often use it to listen to music."
2,"great sound quality, poor comfort","I have to say that this headset lives up to the reputation of Sennheiser: the sound quality is remarkable, the voice is clear. However it presses my head like crazy and after a couple hours of use, I have to get it off my head, leaving me some headaches. And I have a fairly small head. So big head, beware and avoid this product."
5,The best for me,"I just switched down from a Sennheiser PC350 to this baby.The basses are not as good, but I can wear this all day long (PC350 for a few hours).Very easy wear and excellent sound quality (not a surprise from Sennheiser).The USB versions I don't like that much, I don't want to switch back and forth for each application."
4,Sennheiser pc131,"They are very good for talking like on skype, no problems with micHeadphones are not very loud not recommended for listening loud music or playing games where every detail is important"
1,the mike leg is too short,"This set did not work for me, so I am just using it as headphones only. The mike's leg is too short for me. When the mike is not directly in front of a mouth, the level is too low. There is no way to extend the leg.Makes me think that standard head has much smaller distance between the ear and the mouth than mine :)"
2,Know how to make it work with your computer,"I'm sure it's a very nice headset mike, but I can't for the life of me get it to work properly with my Gateway laptop that runs Vista. When I can even get the computer to recognize it, it sounds like I have a cold. I went back to the cheap mike that came with a previous desktop PC. The quality is inferior, but at least the sound is clear."
1,Good quality but headaches after some minutes,"I bought two of these long time ago, for a friend and me. Although I liked the sound quality very much, my head started to ache when I had the headset several minutes on. This was not because the pressure at all, I think it was a kind of electromagnetic stuff. I felt the headache just under the line of the headset structure over the head (where the wire goes). My friend happened to feel the same headache. So sadly, I threw mine away."
5,"Works great, and great price!",These work much better than another similarly priced set I had--much better quality of audio playback for the screencast videos I make for YouTube.
2,"Worked Okay, Didn't Last","Used for six months, microphone quit in a couple months, right side of headphones quit recently.Headphones should last longer than that! A disgrace to the Sennheiser name.Volume control was nice while they worked and they had a rather compressed but standard sound. Good for watching movies, not quite up to standard for studio audio work."
1,Unacceptable sound quality,"The sound quality on these headphones is absolutely terrible. On conference calls, others can barely hear my voice and it is very muffled to distraction. When I listen to music, for some reason I have to crank the sound nearly all the way up in order to hear it very well and again the sound quality is very poor. I borrowed other headphones which work just fine. I DO NOT recommend these headphones."
1,Did not work,The cable seems sturdy and well built but it simply did not work with my equipment.The projector (Optoma H31) did not recognize the source (OPPO DVD 971) and there was no image. I tried with my PC but it didn't work either.When I use the 6' DVI cable supplied with my OPPO DVD it works fine (it is too short for my layout though) so it really seems that the problem is the Arista DVI cable.
1,Not a 5 pack,"This is an excellent network adapter. However, Amazon has this wrong. they claim it is a 5-pack, but it is only a single. I have tried to correct them, but have failed. I am still trying to get them to send me the other 4."
4,good relaxing chair,"This is comfortable and nice looking. Reclining is excellently relaxing, or sit up to relax and read."
5,Great Review!,"I bought this book to review recent information on glomerular diseases. The authors are all ""heavyweights"" in research, diagnosis and treatment of these disorders. All of the major primary glomerular diseases are covered. It seems quite up to date including some of the newer molecular biology and genetic information. It is not a ""cookbook"" on treatment but it is well referenced for that information. I am finding it a very informative and actually enjoyable read."
3,Not sure yet...,"This is my very first time using it and so far it's making my scalp tingle like I smeared mint on it. I guess that's the menthol in the product. Smells like hair mayo but its not a terrible smell strong though. As soon as I put it on my scalp started to itch, idk if that was an allergic reaction or an adjustment because the itching stopped after 5 minutes. I'm going to continue use and update my review in about a month; it says results in 8 weeks but hopefully I see improvement in my thinning areas. I wouldn't reccomend it just yet but it's worth a try and its inexpensive. Good luck to anyone who gives it a shot."
3,From the 1986 animated movie,"The songs on this album are not from the 12 episode manga series directed by Kichi Ishiguro but rather from the animated movie called Guyver: Out of Control. That movie is since out of print because it sucked bigtime. The music is ok, but does not live up to the great background music that accompanied the 1989 manga series. I recommend buying the image album rather than this one."
5,Kitchenaid I love you!,"How on earth did I live without one?I am starting to decorate cakes after completing 3 Wilton courses. And I purchased this refurbished KA Artisan mixer. I stick to just baking holiday cookies and cakes and frosting so this worked out fine for me. I decided to wait on purchasing the heavy duty mixer, until I decide to get into bread making.When I recieved it. It looked brand new. I called Kitchen Aid and gave them the serial number and they were able to tell me when my model was made. Found out it was made this year and only a few months ago! Alot of people get them for wedding gifts and return them.. Or they are demo models for a store. KA has the best customer service, and their website has friendly people with plenty of ideas to help you get started. I am a member there too.This has helped me so much in the kitchen, that I don't have anything bad to say about it."
5,This is a good product for the money.....,"My mixer was delivered with no damage to the factory box. I have used it already for cakes, cookies and breads. It wobbles every so slightly when on the highest speed and I'm not sure if that's normal, but it whips cream excellently! I highly recommend this mixer...it looked new right out of the box. With Amazon's free shipping this is an EXCELLENT buy!"
5,I am so happy with my mixer!,"I was so thrilled with getting this mixer! I had wanted a Kitchenaid stand mixer for a long time, and was so happy to finally get one. I had never used one though and was concerned with it being remanufactured; however my concerns were put to rest when I opened the box. The mixer that I purchased was a deep brown, called chocolate, and it was beautiful, not even a smudge! I cant even express what a convenience it is. We use it everyday: eggs, pancakes, icing, cookies, pizza dough, the list goes on. I only wish that I could afford to buy one for all of my sisters! PS did I mention how great it looks on my kitchen counter!"
3,Could be better,"I have an ""old"" unit from the late 80's/early 90's that was made in the USA and still works great. It belonged to my Aunt before she passed away. Comparing it to this made-in-China reconditioned unit I bought from Amazon, the old unit is much quieter. I am guessing the gear train in the motor has been cheapened over time, but it does not appear to affect it's ability to do work. Unless you are using it every day, I don't think the added noise is a big factor. Still, I reach for the old one more often than the newer one."
4,My Kitchenaide is Here!,"Ordered on a Saturday, arrived on Thursday,free shipping(it is very heavy)and $25.00 off promotional coupon. Can't beat that price!Ordered the Oynx Black and it is a beauty, one tiny little scratch on base. Was a little hestitant about a refurbished machine, but, after reading all the reviews, I felt good about ordering-it still comes with 6 months guarantee and Kitchenaides reputation. Have always wanted one, but, the price was prohibitive-Thank you Amazon!! ordered some Farberware Stainless cookware,also and it is terrific!!"
2,Nice mixer but it broke,"Blah, blah, blah...what a nice mixer to have for my museum kitchen. Yes it worked ok while it worked, but it just broke. I don't know why, but from what I've read, it will cost at least $100 to find out and fix. My $200 mixer just became a $300 mixer with no warranty.From now on I'll just use a cheaper mixer (or do it by hand)."
5,this is the way to go,"Reconditioned: other than a few scratches inside the bowl (maybe it was used once) there were no marks indicating this was reconed. After using it the first time we had put as many scratches in it. It comes with a 6 month guarantee from the factory, and has been checked carefully after the recon. to make sure it works, probably checked more than the regular ones coming off the line. Price savings $90 over a brand new one. The mixer showed up 3 days earlier than estimate and the shipping was free with Super Saver. In other words, a great deal.Mixer performance, so far fantastic. My wife uses it for baking bread which it does wonderfully, the less strenuous tasks it performs very well. It sits on the countertop in the back out of the way (too heavy to put down below) but it looks very kitcheny sitting there. You can tell by the weight this is a quality product that will last a long time. Very happy with the purchase and performance."
1,Great Beginning but Dead End,"I needed a mixer that would knead my bread for me which I make twice a week. I loved it when I first got it (Aug 2004) but last night it died (May 2005). The bread I make is the only bread I can eat so I went out and bought a new Pro 5 Kitchen Aid with a 450 watt motor. Hopefully this will be able to handle the bread (only 2 loaves at a time). The mixer is supposed to knead bread and my recipe isn't any larger than the one in the Kitchen Aid book and I didn't knead on any higher speed than 2 but this mixer (size of motor or reconditioned motor to fault?) couldn't take it. If the buyer wants to knead bread twice a week, I wouldn't advise this mixer."
5,"Great mixer, great value","Having had good experiences in the past with factory re-conditioned items, I took a chance on this one -- and was not disappointed.The mixer is solid, quiet, powerful, and looks terrific on the kitchen counter. We have used it for kneading bread dough to whipping cream. It does everything well and came with all of the accessories that we needed."
3,A bit too big for a person who has an apartment,"It doesn't mix ingredients that are on the very bottom of the bowl. It is easy to clean, but is quite heavier than I had expected. I think this product would be fine if you have extra counter space. I think it's a bit pricey and I'm actually using a hand mixer instead of my expensive KitchenAid mixer. I have had this product for 4 years, so it seems to be holding up alright thus far."
5,I LOVE THIS MIXER,"Wow! I love this mixer, Im 49 and this is my first mixer. I love to cook and have always mixed by hand. Also, refurbished? Couldn't find one thing wrong. I didn't know it could be so easy, Thanks to God for everything He has given me and to Kitchen-aid and thank you Amazon for your wonderful service. WoW it sounds like I just won a reward, I did!"
5,Great Deal,"Hi, I was in the market for a good mixer for my wife, who loves to bake. She has always wanted a good stand mixer but never really wanted to spend the money on herself. I saw many other options but this one was the best for my budget and my wife's need for one of the top of the line mixers."
5,Reconditioned looks and works like new,"I needed a mixer for my second home because I was having a big birthday party for my dad and wanted to make his favorite, making carrot cake cupcakes. But I didn't want to pay full price. This mixer was the perfect solution, and thanks to Amazon, it came right on time for the cupcake-baking extravaganza! Plus, KitchenAid is durable, reliable, and the greatest mixer ever. And although this is factory-conditioned, it looks like new."
4,Wife Loves it.,"I bought this for my Wife, She loves it. Works great and you wouldnt even know it was factory refurbished. Havent had any problems and arrived looking a feeling BRAND SPAKIN NEW!"
5,"Great affordable mixer, perfect conditions","I got this refurbished mixer a couple of weeks ago, for just $169!!! It looks and work perfectly, I'm so happy I could find such a great deal.... Now I look forward to get the pasta attachments"
5,Defently going to be my choice of mixers,"My parents got a new Kitchenaide mixer for their wedding. They used it my entire childhood to make cookies, pizza, tomato soup, ect. Sadly, it died over the summer. The thing lasted for over 20 years. No that I am married and setting up a household, there is no way my husband is talking me out of getting anything else but a kitchenaide mixer!"
4,Great product at an amazing price!,"I have always wanted a Kitchen Aid but didn't want to pay over $300. Before Christmas I came across the great deal here on a refurbished unit. I was nervous to buy a refurb but after reading the other reviews here and Amazon's great return policy I decided to go for it. I bought the black Artisan series mixer and absolutely love it!It has ample power to do any job that I create. I didn't like to hand mix very much, so now I am baking and mixing more, therefore cooking more! I even made bread dough in a matter of a couple of minutes for a school project the other day. Cookie and cake baking have become a joy and are so quick!The mixer arrived without a scratch or flaw - appeared to be brand new. It looks very nice on my countertop, where I keep it so that I can use it all the time.I highly recommend this product to anyone considering buying a mixer. The amazing price and free shipping is also a bonus incentive!"
2,Very Small,"This is a pretty bracelet, but it's very narrow. Even on my 6"" wrist it looked small. It would be ok for a child."
1,Disappointed,"I was really disappointed with this item and it's partly my fault...it was 7 inches which is just too small for whom I intended it for. I should have thought that out better. But the item came dark in color which makes me think it was an old product, close to being tarnished. So it was just not something I could give as a gift."
2,doesn't work,"Tried these for lowering the pH in my fresh water aquarium, simply put, doesn't work. Tested water directly from faucet and pH was around 7.6 and after adding 2 tablets to a 20 gal aquarium, pH is near 8!!! These tablets are useless, stick with something you can read a label on the packaging that describes contents & remedies. Directions do say you may need to soften very hard water first, don't know if this would've made a difference or not!? I'll be buying something else from now on."
5,SUPER,"For those who love German Hard Trance, DJ Dean as always delivers a blast of Euro-energy. What's nice about Vol. 16 is that the heavier techno is nicely balanced by the more commercial Euro-sound, like Adrima - Rainbowland, Ralph Fridge - Man on Mars, Pinball - Stars, ""Dreaming about Paprica 2003"", and the rare 'DJs in the Mood' remix of ""Raise Your Hands Up."" There's even some breaks and rap (""Thunderbird"") to keep things interesting. A very powerful and impressive hard-trance release from DJ Networx.""You can knock us down, but you can't keep us down... We'll just keep getting up stronger than you can possibly imagine.""(The Warp Brothers - Power)"
5,Eros in fine form,"When Eros is in good form, there are very few artists that can come close to his song craftsmanship. This record has more upbeat songs than his previous work, '9', and is a very strong entry in his catalogue. There are many high points on this album, such as 'Bambino Nel Tempo'('Como Un Nino'), 'Solarita' ('Solaridad'), 'Una Nuova Eta' ('Una Nueva Edad') and, of course, the wonderful duet between Eros and Anatasia, 'I Belong to You'. An excellent album full of fine melodies, great singing and quality production."
1,Please Eros - give your songs a grammar check before singing,"I really like some of Eros' previous songs but I also think that his last two albums have been the worst. His syntax is senseless. If his goal is to convey a message in a new language, 'italianish,' then he has done a fantastic job. ""Solaridad"" - is that supposed to mean solidaridad. He has made a fool of himself by not giving his lyrics to a translator that can make sense of what he says. No wonder why he only gets 1-2 hits ot of every record. No one can follow what the *&^(^* he's saying. His harmonious melodies save his ass%%#."
2,"Cute, but dumb","Cheesy, badly drawn coloring pages. Not what I expected; I only give it a two instead of a one because there is an obvious attempt to create a sexy, funny way to interact with your significant other."
1,"Trash, do not purchase","I bought the 512MB version of this product, plugged it into my computer to charge (it charges from the USB port), it flickered a few times then died completely. I contacted their customer service and have had absolutely no response or action. Apparently all they are interested in is taking your money and sending you a rather expensive plastic paperweight, as it can be used for almost nothing else. Build quality is also very poor (it is made in China). Shame on Oregon Scientific for selling such a piece trash and then not even answering any of the customer queries for return or replacement."
1,"On the bright side, I wasn't electrocuted...","...On the down side, after six months of proper usage, water has seeped in, the display is no longer visible, the unit doesn't work, and the USB plug is rusted.I was initially pleased with my purchase. I solved the loose earbud problem by adding Jabra EarGels. I paid attention to the Oregon Scientific guidelines for the player-surface swimming only, for half an hour, and was careful about a tight seal after charging. However, after four months, the display had water in it. The player continued to work for another two months before quitting entirely.It has taken over six weeks for me hear back from Oregon Scientific on how to send the product back-and there is no guarantee they'll fix it.So I have switched to an iPod Shuffle and an Otterbox waterproof box. It's big and bulky, but I'm betting it's a far better investment than another Oregon Scientific product."
4,First solution that works for waterproof music,"I got this as a Christmas present and I love it. I had tried 2 attempts at waterproof music in the past (a waterproof case for a regular mp3 player, and a waterproof radio made by speedo), and both were miserable failures. It works really well for lap swimming. I have 2 suggestions for improvement- wish the volume went up higher, becuase sometimes the earbuds come slightly out of my ears and it's hard to hear. Also, the cord to the ear buds is too long and drags in the water, I have to tuck it into my suit."
1,Very disappointed,"I was very disappointed in this MP3 player since it's the most popular waterproof available. I followed the instructions, but found water in the screen after two uses & rust-colored water coming out of the holes in the ear buds. The third time I tried to use it...it wouldn't even power on.The player is difficult to use because each button performs multiple functions. Even with the manual in front of me, it's confusing to operate. The buttons are small and VERY difficult to push. The water ear buds are uncomfortable & don't stay in place while aqua-jogging. The screen is hard to read even when it's illuminated. The clip comes off so easily that it's almost impossible to clip the unit to anything b/c it just pops off.I wouldn't recommend this product to anyone for any reason. Fortunately, I've recieved a full refund from the vendor.Thanks to the suggestion of another reviewer, I've learned about Otterboxes. I'll be buying an iPod Nano as soon as Otterbox markets the box to fit!"
3,Can't go swimming without taking it with me,"After read many negative reviews, I took a leap of faith to buy this mp3 player. It turned out better than I expected. Please do not buy this thing if you're planning to use it without wearing swimming cap. The headphone won't stay till. The reason I gave it 3 stars because the headphone hurts my ears after using it for more than 45 mins. Overall, I am glad to buy this mp3 player. It keeps my workout more entertaining."
1,"MP3,MP120, Oregon Scientific","Unit is easy to program but I have had nothing but problems with the ear-phones from day one. I was sent replacement rubber cups that protect the phones from water but they too come off. This design is not well suited for our ears, much less water, thus it is just a glorified expensive MP3 player and does not perform as advertised, water proof not with those ear-phones SHAME ON YOU O.S. take this unit off the market. I do not recommed this unit as water proof no way !!"
3,Great Player..... Not So Great Headphones,I bought this player for lap swim but it is impossible to keep the earbuds in my ears. The player works great but just not for lap swim. I use it now in the hot tub.
1,"Don't buy it, even if you think it will be ok.","I read the bad reviews and knew what I was getting into but thought it would be ok. I was wrong. After two uses, the headphone connection started to go bad. If you tighten up the headphone bottom unit, to prevent water from getting into the unit, the headphone connection does not work. In my case, I loosened the headphone bottom unit just a little past extremely tight, to get the headphones to work, and water leaked into the unit. I have an extended warranty but it will not cover water damage. Nothing like a $100 paperweight. Having to remove and re-tighten the headphone bottom unit (to charge or download music) is this products downfall, because the headphone connection will go bad, like in my case, or you will not tighten the unit enough, again like in my case, and water will ruin the unit."
4,A concert to watch over and over again...,"Most concert videos are worth watching only a few times yourself, maybe once with friends etc. But Live Wood is a very energetic concert, well performed, really a must for Weller fans. Especially us Americans who don't get to see him much. I've watched my copy at least ten times and still enjoy it. The energy between Weller and his drummer Steve White is really the focus of the live show. The other musicians are competent, but low-key, almost so as to not steal any attention from the star himself. Highly recommended to all Weller fans."
5,Continuing the Evolution,"If you have seen the earlier Pride Legacy dvds then you will see this as a continuing step towards the great pride events of today. Many of the early Pride events had great matches but are not even close to being great events. Today, the MMA fan wants excitement and a variety of styles and personalities. This volume of Legacy has all of those and not just for one match per event but for almost the whole events. Some of the discs are better than others but everything is good. If you do not have any Legacy sets than this is where you should start collecting old events. Then move backwards till it gets too boring for you to stand and dismiss any event past that threshold. But I highly recommend this one."
5,"Hot, ole time blues with today's recording technology","Sweet all the way down to the bone. Can't say enough about this effort. I can only wish Luther will produce a part II. As reviews go, Moonshine looks like my second favorite blues CD of all time (in my 43 yrs experience), next to Savoy Brown's Getting To The Point. Thx Mr. Allison"
5,Educational? Yes. Dull? No.,"I'm shockingly ignorant about Christian sects and religious history, not to mention my own Jewish background. Oppenheimer's book sparked interesting conversations with my fiance, who was raised going to Catholic folk mass, joined an evangelical group in high school, and then was part of a Unitarian congregation in his early 20's. I had known nothing about these movements, and the book gave me a window into a world that I'm usually separated from. Besides being a great topic for cocktail parties (people don't talk about religion enough), the book is scholarly and meticulously researched, with dozens of interviews with people who were influential in or lived through the religious changes that were a product of 60's counterculture."
1,yawn,"i've read all of simmon's books and have loved every one of them, but this was just boring. sorry, but after finding this book, buying it and trying to read it four times i eventually gave up. it is the first dan simmons book to gather dust on a shelf."
4,The Crook Factory delivers riveting suspense,"Dan Simmon's has written a plausible and exciting tale of suspense and espionage. He creates a compelling portrayal of Ernest Hemmingway during WW II in Cuba. The plot revolves around Hemmingway's foray into spycraft under the supposed aegis of the FBI. The fact that this novel is based on historical fact, makes it even more interesting. The novel is full of plot twists that ensures that the reader is constantly engaged. He is equally adept at character development--his Hemmingway is endearing and convincing. Dan Simmons illustrates great imagination and technique in a variety of genres--horror, science fiction and historical fiction. He is a truly versatile talent. Don't miss this one."
2,Yawwwwwn,Boring....zzzzzThere were maybe 4 chapters of the book that held my interest. The writing was too predictable...WAY too predictable. I knew who agent X was from the get-go. Not Mr. Simmons' best work.
1,Dan Simmons should stick with horror and sci-fi,"I'm a great fan of Dan Simmons and was excited to read his latest, The Crook Factory. It didn't take long to realize that despite his great talent writing horror stories and sci-fi, Dan Simmons cannot write a spy thriller with any of the tension or plot twists required in this genre. I worked on reading this book for 4 weeks convinced at some point it would stop putting me to sleep and get into the spy story. Unfortunately, the story seemed more intent on describing Ernest Hemingway and his celebrity- and party-filled life during WWII. Since I am not an Ernest Hemingway fan and have no desire to know the minutia of his life, I found this book an excellent sleeping pill. It deserves two stars because the last 50 pages were moderately interesting, but I give it one here to get the average rating down to where it should be."
2,A One-Sentence Review,"Dan Simmons remains one of my favorite authors (due to Carrion Comfort, Hyperion, Olympos, etc.), but like many successful novelists no one edits his work any longer, so - while there is an exciting tale of WW2 intrigue in Cuba with Ernest Hemingway in The Crook Factory - all the heart and thrill is compressed out of it by being minced and wedged between 300 unnecessary pages of pure, boring suck."
3,Not Simmons' best work,"This is an OK book, which makes it below the average for Dan Simmons. It's interesting at times and Simmons deserves some credit for trying to write a spy novel. My main complain is that I figured out most of the secrets well before the book ended (NOT good for a spy novel).If you are a fan of Hemingway you may like it just for a lifelike in-depth description of that man. I did not care that much."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"A spy type story, not really very good. Dan Simmons is delving into something a little Farmeresque, but in this case, you would call it creative biography, rather than creative mythography, I suppose, as this is based around a group of spy types that Ernest Hemingway has put together. How much of this is based on reality, I do not know, but presumably some elements are."
1,Painfully slow moving.,"I am a great fan of Dan Simmons, but this book was slow moving and I couldn't wait to be done with it. If you are a fan of Hemmingway and like slow moving spy stories you might like this, otherwise do yourself a favor and skip it."
2,Life is too short to waste reading dull books.,"I have read just about all of Dan Simmons's writings and the Hyperion books are top-notch science fiction. His horror books easily surpass anyone in that field, including Stephen King but I have read 261 pages of The Crook Factory and had to lay it aside. The only action so far has been the murder in a whorehouse in Havana of a radio operator for a spy ship.A lot of time was spent by the author in researching this book and I am sure it appeals to those readers who enjoy a good spy yarn but it is not my thing.I may read the rest of this book someday when I am retired and have lots of time on my hands but I am in no great hurry to see how it turns out."
1,More chiller than thriller!,"I totally agree with the ""reader from Kansas"" on 7/18/99. I give this one star to bring down the overall rating. This reader's statement that the last 50 pages were somewhat interesting, and that the reader kept waiting for something to happen, are also true. I read this because I like the author, and I kept on because of the reputation of the author, but there is no tension, twists, etc to this story. It just goes on..and on..and on..The problem is that it is described as an espionage thriller, and it's not. It might be good if reviewed within another genre, but not this one."
4,Powerful,"This book really ministered to me concerning revival, and if you are a fan of folks like Leonard Ravenhill, you will enjoy this book. The only part of the book I found rather weak was the last couple chapters that were a large collection of sniplets from the personal Journal of Oswald J Smith. In my opinion, they did not add much to the book, and sometimes it made me wonder if Oswald J Smith really was sound in his faith. Overall though, good book."
2,"Interesting, but by no means enlightening","This book is more of a therapist's guide to dealing with a few particular narcisstic marriages. The only thing this book does is to discuss certain narcisstic personalities in a marriage situation. That's about as far as the author takes the topic. Narcissism is only talked about in a marriage setting, not in terms of any love or relationships outside of a marriage. While the author does give some interesting examples and does well comparing and contrasting narcisstic and non-narcisstic personalities, the examples are few and are very particular to certain types of marriges and are hard apply to anything else. The author also doesn't give any clues on how to go about changing narcisstic patterns if you're stuck in them, which is what I was hoping to find when I bought the book."
4,Narcissism and Intimacy,"A defining dimension of pathological narcissism is the inability to foster and maintain intimacy. Intimacy is not only feared - it is despised because it is perceived as 'common' and 'degrading'. The narcissist idealizes his sources of narcissistic supply and then habitually discards and devalues them. This book is instrumental both as a somewhat iconoclastic introduction to narcissism and as an anatomy of the frustration that is life with a narcissist. Sam Vaknin, author of ""Malignant Self Love - Narcissism Revisited""."
4,Enlightening,"I have read this book 5-6 times over the last decade and find something new each time, as I have grown and changed over the years. It is not an easy read for the lay person but well worth the effort. It gave me insight and understanding into the behavior of a former husband as well as others over the years, including myself at various stages in my life. I highly recommend this book to anyone for it's value in explaining object relations - what an eye-opener."
1,other book better,I could not get into this book at all........... the other book I bought was so much better. Sorry.
4,Good one...,"Keith Urban is doing well as a country singer. However while listening to the songs you tend to get a queer feeling that his previous album ""Golden Road"" was slightly better. However if you enjoy country music, you're in for a treat. Good lyrics, wonderful rhythm, and good music all lend to that ""easy going"" kind of a feeling. A pleasurable album & a must have."
4,I like it.,"Each and Everytime I listen to it in the car, I find I like a new song. Slow or fast - happy or sad. They all make me smile."
4,Good Cd,"This is a really good CD. My FAVORITE song right now is ""Making Memories Of Us"" - What an AWESOME song!!"
3,Be Here,"Not a bad CD. It is a little tough for me to rate this cd properly due to the fact that I'm not a fan of country music. However, I enjoyed Making Memories Of Us, The Hard Way, and Tonight I Wanna Cry a lot."
5,keith urban is the hottest!,"he is absolutely amazing! i love his voice, his accent, the way he plays the guitar and of course his incredible good looks! MARRY ME KEITH URBAN!! The new cd is so good! All of his songs are worth listening to every word - Go buy the cd!"
5,You will not take this out of your CD player!!!,"His music is addicting, comforting and just plain fun, you will go through so many emotions listening to this CD and will love every song a long the way. I am so proud, I can not say enough about Keith Urban. He is the real thing - a true musical talent, guitar playing that will knock your socks off!! I FEEL THAT HE IS ON THE VERGE OF BEING ONE OF THE GREATS IN ALL MUSIC GENRES. There are not many CD's that will captivate you to listen throught to the end, if you want one BUY BE HERE!!!"
2,wasnt as thrilled....,"I thought that this album wasnt one of Keith's best albums...I like some of the older albums better but maybe we will see more of the ""better"" albums in the future."
2,really mediocre,"Hard to believe that this guy is a best selling artist. Sure he's got the looks, the flash, and the slickness to be a success in the entertainment industry, and I suppose his Australian/New Zealand roots make for an interesting back story. But in the final analysis, the music here is bland, formulaic, and ultimately boring. It's sort of like a paint by numbers painting, Nashville style. Sure it's fun to do a paint by the numbers painting, but do you really want to put it in a frame?"
1,Poser,May the Gods of Country Music save us from posers and wannabe's like Keith Urban. Here is a guy that couldn't play his guitar fast enough to play rock and roll so he settled for country. Makes me wonder if the founders of the Grand Ole Opry are spinning in their graves right now. Might as well have Britney Spears sing Patsy Cline. This isn't country it's pop.
4,Worthy follow up CD from talented Urban,"Not typically a Country music fan, I was recently introduced to the Australian crossover sensation and was impressed and won over by his approachable, listener-friendly tracks. This latest collection is also great, although I expected some more insightful maturation in the lyrics or even more experimentation with the music. I think, while making sure to please his diehard CW fans, this effort played it a little too safe.Regardless, the guy is a real talent & showman and this CD will probably be in heavy rotation on your stereo!"
5,Almost Live,"If you have ever seen Keith Urban in concert, then you know that his recorded music is as close to ""live"" as it gets without actually being ""live"". ""Be Here"" is no exception. Great music, great songs and great recording! Keith always puts his heart and soul in each song, even the few songs he didn't have a hand in writing. ""She's Gotta Be"" is perfection! ""Be Here"" is track after track of songs that will soon be your favorites. If you have never seen Keith Urban in concert, then Be Here is a taste of what you can expect."
4,Keith Urban is amazing!,This CD tops Golden Road which I absolutely loved. The songs are clear and strong and he performs them with lots of heart and soul. I strongly recommend it.
5,Keith Urban AMAZES me again,"WOW, this cd is nothing short of amazing. I have to say that the song ""Days Go By,"" is one that you roll down the windows, slide the sunroof open, and crank it while cruising down the road. ""Nobody Drinks Alone"" is a very deep song, after hearing it, stuck in my head for awhile. ""Tonight I Wanna Cry"" sent chills down my spine, very good track. I could talk all day about how good the whole cd is. The upbeat songs make me feel great and the slower songs break me down. Isn't it strange that you can be listening to country on the radio or a cd even, then all of a sudden that song comes on that relates to the way you are feeling at that very moment? It happens to me all the time. I have a special place in my heart for country music. Anyways enough rambling on, BUY THIS CD!!!! Indulge yourself into Keith Urban's music, it is money DEFINATELY well spent."
5,His best yet,"This new Keith Urban CD is just great, even better than all the others, if that's possible. His tracks are full of emotion, sensitivity, good beats, great lyrics and Keith Urban's singing is as gorgeous as ever. I highly recommend this CD to any Keith Urban or country music fan."
5,Awesome CD.....From start to finish,"First I heard of Keith Urban was on Sessions at AOL...I like listening to artist's live first and see if they can really perform - and I was impressed! He did not only look good but he can strum those guitars and crank up the vocals. I was never a big fan of country but when I bought his albums, I listened to it from start to finish (I hardly do that nowadays). I also had a chance of seeing him live in concert......really, really awesome! Definitely not just a studio singer. Highly recommended CD"
5,LOVE THIS CD!!,I've never been a country music fan until I heard Keith Urban! This CD is great! Every song is a hit and Keith has a great voice. What a cutie too! I saw him in concert a few months ago and loved him - what a great entertainer!
5,Great Rockin' Guitar Driven Country !!!,"If you like to jam to country music,......this album is a MUST !!!Rockin' guitar and soft balads all the way through !!!!Beginning to end: AWESOME !!!!"
5,MAKING MEMORIES OF US,MY NEW WIFE OF 10 YEARS AND I LOVE THIS SONG.I WISH I HAD MET HER WHEN I WAS OF MARRYING AGE
5,A Truly Moving Experience,"I happened across the trailer for this movie on the apple trailer website, and it looked really interesting. On a whim I picked up the dvd when I saw a deal. My wife and I watched it and I have to say that this movie is one of my favorite films. The awkwardness of being a teenager has never been so vividly, humorously and at the same time heartbreakingly shown. The director obviously went to a lot of trouble to show Billy honestly, but with dignity. Billy is a special ""kid"" and I think most viewers can see a part of themselves in him. I highly recommend this film, it is incredible!"
5,Billy the Man!,"Easily one of the best documentaries I've seen in a long time. A great, quiet little film about an amazingly complex, intelligent, unique young man. Fantastic!"
3,Only Showed The Negative Side,"I recently watched this documentary on Hulu, and there were many scenes that I felt were painful to watch. This documentary only showed the negative side of having Asperger's Syndrome. It showed that he has trouble interacting with people. There were many scenes where I went back to my painful memories of high school. There was a scene close to the beginning where his mother described a bad encounter with a girl at his school, he confessed his love for her and she dumped him in front of a bunch of people. Although his mother said he handled it well, I flashed back to my painful memories of high school. I know how it feels to be set up and humiliated by people. Billy did seem like a very intelligent and likable person, but I couldn't really see it shown in this documentary. I was offended that it showed the things Aspies can't do, and didn't focus on things they can do."
3,"Stick with ""Too Bad Jim""","This isn't bad, but I wish Jon Spencer Blues Explosion had never heard of R.L. Burnside. Just stay out of his way! Anyway, ""Too Bad Jim"" is the essential R.L. Burnside album. The rest are decent but unnecessary."
2,This is strange,"No not the music, but my changed opinion of it. I used to love this. It was great late night post-party malaisey haze music. Now all I hear is a guy who can't sing, count or keep a beat. So what has changed? Well I drink less..."
2,Not a Great CD,"This CD is ok. Most of the songs are boring and slow. The 1997 hit""Your Woman"" is the best song on the CD. The second best is ""Undressed"" then it goes down hill from there. If you heard the song and are dying to hear it over and over then find the single! If you want to hear their other songs I suggest not to get this CD but it's your choice. I made a mistake getting this CD but I had no idea. Save your money, and don't buy this CD."
2,A disappointment,"I must admit I had high hopes for this album. The single ""Your Woman"" became an out-of-nowhere hit, with good reason...catchy, distant, spooky, recalling the best synth pop of the 80's topped off with obscure lyrics...an astonishing single. The album as a whole, on the other hand, has some pleasant moments, namely ""Death of my Desire,"" ""Undressed"" and the bizarre and downbeat female-led ""Wanted""...but none of these tunes measure up to the single. A thoroughly painless listen, but bland. Stick with the single."
1,Devoid Of Musical Talent,"If you like the song ""Your Woman,"" try to buy it on a single rather than this whole album. This album is bland and lacking any true talent. It's sad that they would have one good song and the rest would be amateur at best."
2,blah,"I suppose there might be some people who would enjoy this ""music""...however I didn't...Your woman is a great song in the same way that folk implosions ""natural one"" is a good song...but white town really don't have much else to go on with this album.I have a feeling that some people might follow this band devoutely but I think for most, that if you feel like buying this you might want to get it for like 2 bucks or something."
3,The DJ of White Town has great talent but doesn't always sho,"White town has good remixing skills and has the right ear for beat, melody, etc., as shown in ""Your Woman"". However he fails to carry out this talent in his other songs, or should I say he has an entirely different sound to his other songs, and though this could be a good thing for some people, I prefer the sound of ""Your Woman""."
2,UGH!,"If I would of only known that only two songs are worthy from this album I would of taped it from somebody else, but yet again I doubt nobody would of had it since it prolly sold even atleast 2,000 copies. 'Undress' and 'Your Woman' are the solid ones, the rest are skipable. You'd be better off now downloading only the ones mentioned. Again 90% prolly doesnt even know this band (album) exists so i don't know if my suggestions will be read."
3,???,Going through my old CD's and found this one. I can't believe that I actually listened to this crap back in the day. It's hard to believe that I've made a transformation from this to hardcore metal...WIERD!
1,Not worth buying,I purchased this for a closet and wanted a battery operated fluorescent for brighter light. It was used only a few times before conking out. I thought a GE product would have been of better quality. Guess I'll continue looking for a solution.
1,Cheap--don't buy,"I bought 3 GE 6"" Fluorescent battery operated lights for my curio cabinet. After having them lit for 4 hours the first night, all the lights were out due to dead batteries. That was a total of 12 AA batteries used, which were new when I started. Not worth the money."
4,The modeling book must with Lightwave!,"I am a designer who is attempting to delve into the world of 3D. In comes Brilliant's book on Dinosaurs, but the kicker is that what you learn in this detailed and simple to follow book can be applied to much more than dinos. Very well written and illustrated (great image files included on the CD). With a minimal knowledge of most 3D apps, you can start creating some neat stuff. I also like the fact that texturing is greatly discussed in later chapters. This book fills a definit publication niche specifically dealing with organic or creature modeling, dinosaurs in this case. I wish this book would have been included in most 3D application packages as part of their documentation...one can only wish!"
3,Dated and basic,"Coder to Developer is about the basics of being a software developer. The book focuses on going over concepts like source control, creating a build process, and bug tracking. There are also many pages that cover tools for Visual Studio .NET 2003. This is unfortunate since this information is now out of date and no longer adds any value. I didn't derive much value from it, but I feel it could have been useful for me if I had read it right after college or if I had never worked for a large software shop.If you consider yourself more of a software developer already, I recommend readingThe Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Masterinstead. Despite being written four years earlier, that book is written in a much more timeless manner by focusing on concepts and ignoring the tools of the day."
2,"Worthwhile Topics, Out of Date Tools","Some topics in this book are timeless, the tools discussed are not. This book is so far out of date now that I cannot recommend it.The author covers project planning and setup from spec to code storage in chapters one to three. Chapters four and five cover some good practices with .NET code. Chapters six through eight; .NET tools. Chapters nine and ten; bug tracking in .NET. Chapter 11 is how to work with people. Chapters 12 and 14 documentation and licensing. Chapter 13 and 15 build and deployment of .NET projects.At the time of it's writing this book would have been great for a developer who was fresh out of college and starting a .NET job. I often found myself thinking, ""Yep, I do that because learned the hard way"". I also found myself skipping sections when author mentioned a specific tool.I wish I could give this book a good review. Had I read this when it came out I would have given it five stars. Now it's worth at most a skim of the good chapters."
2,Average at best .Net,"This is a beginner book specifically aimed at .net developers. I'm afraid a lot of people will think this is a general language book for advanced development/system architecture methodology - it is not.As i said, it's pretty beginner and full of product reviews. its filled with tools, and even some tool documentation which feeled more like filler (if you are going to use Nant, will you use the crap documentation in this book, or the one that comes with nant?).If you are developing .Net application and don't know the basics than this book might be for you."
4,Quality read,"I am surprised at the number of people that complained about the .Net specific material. I have read many books using JAVA and other languages that translated well to my current development efforts. It's how the tools are used not what the tools are.This book is a great introductory text into general programming techniques: take advantage of your IDE, use tools that complement your IDE, use test driven development, map out a project, team development, track your time, etc.Almost all the subjects deal with programmer professionalism. Subjects that we take for granted that no one really writes about and most programming texts do not delve into: leverage your tools, look for resources beyond the accepted tool set. Will this make you a top notch programmer? No, but it's like having a break room conversation with a programmer ace and realizing that what you do could be a lot easier."
3,Best for .NET-using novices,"I really didn't get much out of the book. The .NET-specific content, of which there is plenty, wasn't useful or interesting for me, because I work on Java and Macintosh software.If you're not a novice programmer, I'd strongly suggest looking over the text before purchasing.It would, I think, be useful for a novice programmer, or someone fresh out of school who's been working on class assignments, rather than real-world projects.The author is focused on individual or small-team development, but I would have liked to have seen quite a bit more on design and development processes."
2,Serious errors,"I used to use this text for AI undergraduate courses, and have given up. It has grievous errors in it, including in the on-line errata. Two quick examples: the information theoretic equations for decision trees is dead wrong. And the alpha-beta algorithm is completely incorrect. The text also has packed large amounts of information into very tight spaces, leading to poor explanations in important sections: the backpropagation section in particular consistently leads to serious confusion among students. And attempts to reduce algorithms into a procedural rather than functional/recursive format only result in excess complexity.This is particularly frustrating because there really is no good undergraduate text for AI. This one comes close, packing in lots of stuff into an inexpensive volume. But the errors are serious enough, and in such high-utility sections, that this book cannot be recommended."
1,Terrible,"both speakers were bad, did not perform, only purchased for preaching and singing, and upon installation both speakers were terribly distorted. Had to go pruchase speakers from a pawn shop to replace them. Never buy speakers online again. $70.00 wasted."
4,Pyle PPA10 PA Woofers,"Sounds good but, if you want them to last, I would just use a 100w. per channel amp for these with a good equalizer. You'll be satisfied."
5,Works great - neutralizing wax,This product is great at removing any wax put on the floor so you can start fresh. Easy to apply -
3,Those bloody Reds.,"Ivan Bunin would have you believe that the Ancient Regime in Czarist Russia was a kind, benovolent regime. Most historians know that is not the case. Bunin would like you to believe that it is. Bunin records his beliefs on the Russian Civil War. His observation was from Moscow and Odessa. He describes the brutality of the Reds and how they treated people. The Reds may have been more brutal, but both the Czarist and Communist regimes had very difficult problems with respecting human rights. Both killed people.I found his memories of these days interesting. They should not be read as a disinterested observer of the new order. He was very vocal about the Reds, and viewed the Whites as a hope of mankind (which they were not). However, this story gives a view of the Russian Revolution from a member of a class that lost it all."
4,Inspirational!,"I bought this book after hearing Heather interviewed on a radio programme. She sounded so friendly, serene and content with her life. If I hadn't heard her before I read the book I might have thought she was 'too good to be true' because in the book she comes over as a unbelievably forgiving and accepting of God's will.However this really IS a story of hope and positivity and shows that if you have a positive nature and strive to put your trust in God (do what your instincts feel are right and good)then you can overcome anything. Like Heather I truly believe God never gives us anything we aren't equipped to cope with.A book that I didn't put down until I'd finished it!"
5,Startling Beauty,"Heather Gemmen was raped at knifepoint in her own home while her two young sons slept down the hall. The subject matter is real and not sugar-coated. We feel her pain and read her thoughts as she shares honestly and openly the struggles faced by herself, her family, and friends, and the agony surrounding each day and every decision.After I read the book, I stood in the shower and sobbed. I wept for Heather, for myself, and the others who have endured this torment. Rape is violent, degrading, and demoralizing. Startling Beauty is proof that God can heal, restore, and turn suffering into a thing of beauty.Thank you Heather."
5,Startling Beauty,"This book is both interesting and inspirational how she could find beauty and restoration after experiencing such evil. Complete with study guide questions in the back, would make for a great book club discussion. A very good read!"
4,Courageous,"After reading all the reviews I am amazed how each person draws something different from this book. Rape + baby does not have to equal abortion. In fact God reveals His awesome ability to take what was meant for evil and create so much beauty. Not just in Rachael - but in Steve's and Heather's marriage. I am in awe of the personal strength that it takes to reveal to the world this kind of personal and emotional nakedness.I hope those who are in law enforcement and those who deal with those who have been raped, male or female, will benefit from this book.Words can heal or destroy.Thank you Heather and Steve."
4,Enjoyable...,"This has the typical super-starred, glamorous touch that house had back in 1995-1996, before it started to get produced a little too well (jazz-acoustic-r&b-FUSIONS...made by a number of people sort of like a live band, instead of by one or two DJ/producers). You got the catchy jingles, thumpin beats, and of course Derrick Carter blending tracks over each other for minutes at a time, hard to tell wether it's cumming or going. Chicago made a strong comeback, although this sounds more New Yorkish at the Sound Factory or the Tunnel, but anyways it's all good, I bought it in March 2002, and it still sounds nice!!!"
1,If your a Manc then your a Wanc,First off the video quality is terrible and the audio seems to be a half a second off from the video. It's really hard to navigate the DVD menu. Most importantly Manchester United sucks and should perish forever. This is a waste of money. The only reason I purchase this DVD was to compare it to the quality of Arsenal's DVD. There is no comparison. I regret this purchase.
5,"This album is just as good as ""Upstairs at Erics""","I find it hard to beleive people knocking this album. I do not see any weakness any of the songs written by Alison Moyet. Songs like ""Sweet Thing"" and ""And On"" are awesome. This album I'd say is a bit more moody and deep that Upstairs At Erics. I guess that spoils the mood for people who just want a dance album. The political and social messages of this album are strong and brillant... Examples are ""Mr. Blue"", ""Unmarked"", and ""State Farm."" A moody, poetic, brillant and charming synth album. The strenght of both their albums has made Yaz one of my favorite bands."
4,good old 80's,Remember the good days of music. Kids these days are getting into the 80's. You can see why when you listen too this. Im glad vince clark split up to create erasure. However I wish he would of made more yazoo music.
3,3 1/2 Stars...,"Although I like Upstairs At Eric's better, this one has some stylish tunes that should please fans of 80's synth-pop: Some of my favorites are ""Nobody's Diary,"" a catchy melodic number to begin, ""Softly Over"" and ""Mr. Blue,"" slower but nice, ""Sweet Thing"" and ""Walk Away From Love"" are a couple floor favs, and ""State Farm"" is cool. Alison has such a soulful mix in her vocals and Vince does a bang up job on the synths.If you like electronic music, I recommend Agnes Poetry, Iris, and De/Vision also. <Cheers>"
3,Track TEN?,"I discovered the band YAZ last year during research on the birth control YAZ.Interested, I borrowed the CD from the library and loved it. Especially #1 ""Nobody's Diary"" had significant meaning for me. Most all of them are wonderful, but #10 was ""HAPPY PEOPLE"" and I listened to the most- it was upbeat and very catchy.However when I purchased the CD it looked exactly the same as the one I have borrowed... yet upon listening to it realized that this track is different. (State Farm)I haven't a clue why the discrepancy... if someone could help explain it to me (politely) or even how to go about getting a corrected copy, I would gladly rate the item higher. It really is a good album otherwise, but Track Ten is terrific!"
5,No collection is complete without it,I dont care what kind of music you listen to this cd is a must have. There is not one song that got major airplay but when you listen to the cd from start to finish you will not find a dud. My favorites are Nobody's Diary and Mr. Blue (one of my favorite songs of all time).Some might argue that you can get the best songs on the greatest hits album (Yaz only had 2 cds) but I think your money is better spent by buying both albums.You and Me Both can be bought used for a $1.99 and I would stronly suggest you buy it. Once you play it you will never put it down.
5,"Loved it then, love it now!",This is without a doubt my favorite cd of the 80's. Especially Mr. Blue is captivating. Excellent!
5,A Secret Treasure !!!,"This album is every bit as good as Upstairs at Erics. In fact I like it better. Alison Moyet really shines as a vocalist. The songs are accessible and really turn into favorites very quickly. These songs have a bit more social depth to them, if you truely listen to the lyrics, you can see it. Mr Blue is an absolute gem, and Ode to Boy is so special, it's almost erotic! Buy this album if you liked Upstairs at Erics... you will like this one too!"
1,A HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT!!!!!!!!!,A HORRIBLE FOLLOW UP ALBUM TO UPSTAIRS AT ERICS. ONLY 2 SONGS - NOBODYS DIARY AND STATE FARM ARE EVEN WORTH LISTENING TOO.
3,"Band had one good album, this isn't it.",Upstairs at Eric's is the one to own. Don't bother with this one.
3,Cheap price without the fillers!,"This contains no PETROLATUM OR MINERAL OIL!For all my natural or organic friends you know this is good.Smell is light and the texture is creamy.I will give an update later on,but so far seems very promising.If you read my reviews, I have given the swisa butter a good one but I wanted to try something that is specially geared for hair care.UPDATE... Not as moisturizing for my dry hair as my swisa,but still worth a try.I will keep it and incorporate it my routine."
3,Beware of pub date!,"Although Amazon is listing the pub date as 2008, the 'new revised edition' actually came out in 1999 - and this edition ONLY covers movie titles up to 1995!! Although the book is quite thick (AND heavy) the type is rather small, and given that India produces over 900 films a year, this necessarily covers merely a fraction of the total output (synopses are of about 25 - 50 films each year), so there are some glaring omissions. That said, it is a fairly good and accurate resource for Indian films from 1910-'95, as well as biographical material on some of the heavyweights involved (the first 240 pages of the book). It is past time for an update...or perhaps even a second volume, covering 1995 to the present."
3,critic,complete from beginning to 1995 . A bit old fahion an few B & W photos. For specialists or students wanting datas
4,night forest,"this is one of the best native american flute albums i've heard,very talented and worth purchasing.........lookingbear"
3,Middle of the road for CO,"This CD is middle of the road in listenability of all CO's stuff to date. Seems this first came out in 1996 which is pre-Thunder Chord where they really found their sound. Most of the melodies are thin flute solos and, with the exception of Woodland Flutes, are not the more enticing layering or droning that appears in CO's best works. This is probably worth having in your 'Native Flutes' collection if you are heavy into CO, otherwise not. These days my hat goes off to Scott August who has many brilliant CDs such asRadiant Sky"
3,Dissapointment compared to previous works,"Compared to some previous works like Thunder Cord, I found this release to be a disappointment. A few good individual tracks but the album dosn't flow well or seem to have a central theme like other Coyote works."
2,very average and the start of decline,though her voice is still intact the music is gets real boring and very safe.she hasn't been the same artist since this disc.it's been very down hill.this disc is to soft and to much like a poor Mariah Carrey knock off.her first two are still her best two.a few songs since then but overall she has lost her edge.
3,Not one of her best.......,"I had lost all of my CD's and am now trying to rebuild my collection. I'm a big Mary fan, but forgot that this particular CD was on the mediocre side."
5,THIS IS THE BEST MARY CD OF ALL TIME,"THIS CD IS GREAT FOR HANGING WITH YOUR FRIENDS, CHILLIN' WITH YOUR MAN(OR GIRL),AND JUST KICKING BACK AFTER A HARD DAY."
5,What can I say I love this girl...!!!!!,Share My World is another one of my favorite albums by Mary J. Blige. No other R&B female can touch this woman!!!! My favorite tracks were:#2 I Can Love You (BETTER THAN SHE CAN) sing it girl!!!#4 Round and Round#6 Share My World (She was definitely in love w/ someone)Favorite#7 Seven Days#9 Thank You Lord Interlude#10 Missing You#11 Everything#13 Can't Get You Off My Mind (I was definitely feeling this one!)#15 Searching#16 Our Love#17 Not Gon'Cry (I had to cry on this one!)WHAT CAN I SAY I LOVE HER MUSIC!!!!
5,QUEEN OF HIP-HOP WITHOUT A DOUBT,"MARY IS DEFINITLY A TALENTED ARTIST. WHO HAS SHOWN THAT EVERYONE IS DEFINITLY HUMAN AND WE ALL CAN FACE MANY OF THE SAME TRIALS WHETHER YOU ARE FAMOUS OR NOT. I LOVE THIS C.D. IT HAS HELPED MY MAN AND I THREW MANY OF PROBLEMS JUST LISTENING TO THE LYRICS. SHE IS DEFINITELY ONE OF THE HOTTEST FEMALE VOCALIST OUT THERE. MANY SAID SHE WOULD NOT OF MADE WITHOUT PUFFY, BUT SHE HAS AND IF YOU ARE A TRUA FAN OF HER WORK YOU WILL LISTEN DESPITE WHAT LABEL SHE IS ON. I THINK SHE IS A SOULFUL,SMART AND RESOURCEFUL HUMAN BEING.AND NOBODY IN THIS WORLD IS PERFECT WE ALL NEED TO STOP JUDGING EACH OTHER AND LOOK ON THE INSIDE."
2,Mary has done better,"This was a good Mary J album, but it was not a Mary J Blige album: Only two songs really rocked: it's on and seven days, everything else was okay. I say down load to the two songs and keep rolling."
3,No Diva in this album,"I read some of the other reviews and now that I have the album I pine for the old days of soul. Yes she has a great voice, but the writer makes many a song a hit. In this case the writer fails to come above anything other than an amateur. Beat, rythmn both there but then try to listen to the song. Just doesn't have the impact of a Stevie Wonder, Etta James, or Marvin Gaye song. Sadly I do not feel that this is one of the top albums that one would relish in a collection. Good but not great."
2,Y'all know I love Mary,"but if you are considering this cd...skip it. The radio played the mess out of what could have been one of the few interesting songs on the cd (I Can Love You). This cd is sooo commercial. It feels like air. None of the bangin' beats characteristic of the Queen of Hip Hop Soul are present. Searching has a cute break beat thing happening. Other than that I really felt like getting my money back. I recommend What's the 411, My Life or Mary."
3,"No, No, No.......","Here we go again, more over-rated acclaim for an average album. I give the SONGS ""I Can Love U"", ""Everything"" and ""Not Gon' Cry"" 5 stars, but as far as the album in it's entirety, now way will I give in and call it classic. To add insult to injury, the vinyl copy I bought was poorly pressed and defective. Most of the songs skip and I can't even listen to ""Everything"" because the needle just goes crazy on this track. I would rather Mary J. Blige release an album with just 8 songs on it, and leave the rest of the filler off. Thank u."
2,THIS CD WAS MEDIOCRE....,"I like some of the songs on this CD, particularly ""I Can Love You""(Lil'Kim's rap solo is off the hook even though she made that lil error re: Ninja Honda) ""Share My World"" and ""Everything"". Let us address one thing though... Mary.Cannot.Sing.She can carry a tune. She slurs notes instead of hitting them straight on. Her pitch is awful at times and what could be considered her ""vocal stylings"" are basically the same scratchy, non-melodic riffs throughout every song. I think the word here should be ""caterwauling"". You can tell that the studio has glossed over her vocals and judging by her awful live singing you can also tell that she was coached in the studio while making this album. I don't dislike Mary J. but if she is the Queen of Hip-Hop SOUL with all that pitiful wailing then I guess Al B. Sure is the King *laugh*"
1,Do not order from this company,"My actual rating is no star. I ordered this Mary J. Blige cd on April 10, 2009. It is now June 27,2009 I have yet to recieve this cd. However they did get my money! Be very careful."
4,I love this cd!!!,"I think this album was a good one to own. I still listen to all the songs. I love album were you can listen to all the way though and never get tired or bore with it. My favorite songs off the album is ""Can't Get You Off My Mind"", ""Round and Round"" and ""I Want to Get to Know You Better"". Also the Hits from the album such ""Everything"" and ""I Can Love"". Think you should check out this album it is a must for any Mary J. Blige fan or for any R&B lover."
4,"I think ""Share My World"" along with Mary are just fantastic!","I am a real big fan of Mary J. Blige. I think that all of her albums are great. I have all of her albums. I think that she is a very talented lady. I would definitely like to meet her one of these days. Anyway, if you haven't bought the CD or any of her other CD's, I suggest you buy them now, especially if you are looking for something soft and soothing."
3,Disappointing,"It was bound to happen to her sooner or later. She made two excellent albums in a row. I guess the third time wasn't the charm. This album didn't really live up to my expectations of the first two. ""Love is All We Need"" is kinda forgettable. And she really didn't do much justice for Natalie Cole's ""Our Love."" The only great song on here is ""Seven Days."" I hope she can make up that mediocrity with her next album."
5,No one can touch her!,"This has to be the best R&B album of 1997. In this album, like her previous two, she sets a trend instead of following one. In this album, Mary has proved that she is a force to be reckoned with in the music industry. She is indeed the ""Queen of Hip-Hop Soul"", and there is no one out there who comes close to dethroning her. While the hip-hop is not as abundant as her other two works, she still keeps it real and to the streets with hip-hop classics-to-be ""I Can Love You"" and ""Round & Round"". The rhythmic ""Everything"" is sure to appeal to the masses. Quiet storm dwellers will cuddle up to songs like ""Share My World"", ""Seven Days"", ""It's On"" and ""Missing You"". And songs like ""Searching"" and ""Keep Your Head"" will have you thinking as you move to the beats. There is a song for everyone on this album. A definite buy; this is a classic in the making."
3,Not Bad,I only wanted this album for one song and the rest of it wasn't bad but you really have to be a Mary J. Blige fan to appreciate all the songs. It's okay.
5,TRULY A CLASSIC!!!,"I could not put this book down once I picked it up and I am not a person who usually likes trivia. Everything from the 50s to the 70s is included. I especially enjoyed the rock and roll time line and the top 350 songs of the century. Joe has a great sense of humor that is reflected in the book. I especially enjoyed the section about death songs and the one hit wonders list brought back a lot of memories. 'Rock, Roll, and Reminisce' has hundreds of challenging trivia questions all listed by category. I would recommend this for anyone who loves the oldies and this book would make a great gift."
3,Not bad but a little cheap,My two year old daughter loves playing with the animals and she would never notice what I saw: several of the animals had paint come off (before using them) and the giraffes and zebras did not stand up very well since the legs were too close together.Not the best quality but they are fun for my daughter.
4,Hardwood Magic,"The NBA today basically ignores the NBA that was home to places like Syracuse, Cincinnati and Rochester. That is why first-person recollections are so important as the history of those seasons fade with the passing away of former players and owners.Critics can state with some credibility that Red Auerbach has had so much written on him and by him that Let Me Tell You A Story can be overlooked. But John Feinstein brings new life to old stories by piecing together biographical information with recollections by Auerbach through interviews at weekly lunches conducted by the hall of famer and friends.For older fans, it is a travel down memory lane. The fans who started with Bird-Magic, Michael or LeBron will learn where the league was not so many years ago and how the foundation was set to make the NBA truly a world league."
4,Great stories from a great coach,"If you're a coach or a leader of any kind, do yourself a favor and make time to read about Red Auerbach, a managerial genius.I have not (yet) read other books on Auerbach (but I will!), so I cannot say whether this is the best book, but it certainly contains many wonderful stories.I enjoy John Feinstein's straightforward and unpretentious writing style. I also like that he quotes people directly rather than paraphrases them.The only reason I give this book four stars instead of five is that I found the framing story (about all the weekly ""China Doll"" restaurant lunch attendees) less interesting than Auerbach's stories themselves. Regardless, this book is definitely worth reading. It's fun to read and full of wisdom.--James"
2,Disappointing,"I was expecting a lot more anecdotes about the NBA and its players. An inordinate amount of this book is taken up with discussing Red's post-retirement weekly roundtable lunch and the various participants. Hearing about a bunch of middle aged and old guys sitting around eating chow mein and idolizing Red is not very entertaining.I have no doubt that all of Red's adventures in the NBA would make a fantastic book. Unfortunately, this is not that book."
3,a great look back into time,it is a great book for the originals of basketball back when the ball player didn't make millions of dollars great story telling when basketball was basketball
5,Fascinating and Entertaining Read,"Growing up during the prime of Red Auerbach's coaching career in Boston, I was still too young to understand why he left coaching. This book reveals much of the factual story in a very entertaining way. John Feinstein has organized the material and put it together so that I heard Red's voice telling the stories and John's providing explanations when they were required.I highly recommend this book to all basketball fans of a certain age and to those who may be distressed over where the game is going."
4,terrific,great book awesome stories. i actual went by the restaurant wherte they eat. The game lost an amazing lifer.
2,Just not for me,The case its self was cracked when I received it but the CD its self was in good shape.This was the first Lake Wobegon I had tried and they just arent for me I will not purchase another one
1,not as stated,"I bought this and 2 other CDs with the impression from reviews that certain stories were included. Apparently the stories I wanted were on the audio cassette, but NOT on the CD. Thanks, Amazon, for teaching me an expensive lesson. I'll not be buying from Amazon's vague product descriptions again"
3,A little disappointed,"I was looking for good Garrison Keilor's monologues and I didn't like the CD of lake Wobegon as much as some of his other stuff. I am still looking for ""the Young lutheran's guide to the orchestra"" for exemple. That was way funier. I still really like this man, even if this Fall CD is not my favorite. Does anyone know if he made CDs of his more recent stuff?"
1,No clue,"I did not understand it. Will pas it to someone who has more knoweldge in the matter. Sorry it is very local, no apt for foreigners."
2,"Good, but depends on what you like","This is a nice book. It's well organized, with insightful essays and thorough geographic coverage. It includes at least one color photograph for each entry. But the entries themselves will determine whether you like this book or not. Deco and Modernism rule the roost for this author, and the selection of buildings reveals that. It's not a guide of historic architecture, per se. Sure, you'll find the obligatory gaslamp district, Old Town and Balboa Park in here, but not the subtler more hidden gems scattered around Bankers Hill, Olive Park or Hillcrest. There is also a heavy emphasis on domestic architecture, which leaves enthusiasts of traditional religious and academic buildings (such as myself) somewhat disappointed."
3,BRUN THE RACIST SYSTEM DOWN!,"Twin citites hard core 100%, some ragin tracks on this cd. my favorite is definatley song 37 DEAD TO THE WORLD, but this cd has a lotta good ones just listen to it, a lot of the songs aren't even a minute long that is the only downfall about this cd but all in all if you like hardcore sh1t this cd has your name written all over it."
4,Great tires for the price but there are cheaper tires!,I ordered these tires for my dolly after I went to tractor supply and noticed they wanted $35 just for one tire. Only complaint I had was they took a while to come in but once they did they slipped right on with no problem. I didn't notice until after I had ordered the tires that harbor freight had the exact same tires for like $5 a piece and I wouldn't have had to pay the shipping or waited forever for them to come in but otherwise I am completely satisfied with this product.
4,"2 New 10"" Air tire wheels 5/8""","I have used the wheels for about a month. I haven't had any problems yet. Before I used the Tricam wheels.The bearings went out on them. I use my wagon to recycle bottles. These wheels, with the sealed bearingsseem to be much better."
4,"Solidly constructed, but ended up with a flat","I bought these to build a go kart (non-motor) with my son for a cub scout project. Overall they seem pretty rugged. However, they do have an inner tube and after a few runs one of the wheels got flat and we found a hole in the inner tube. We patched it with a bike inner tube repair kit, but then it got a new leak. I looked inside and outside of the tire for something that was causing this, but it never found anything. The other tires have been fine. I don't really think the flat tire is due to the quality of the product, but I am not 100% sure - it could be from somehow getting pinched in side there. Overall, I am willing to give it the benefit of the doubt and recommend it."
4,A Great Chief of the Sioux,"As a former Director of the Nebraska State Historical Society Mr. Olson had the opportunity to study many documents unpublished before of the Sioux Nation and the wars between them and the United States. So the idea is given : to write a book that could be considered as a supplement to George E. Hyde's basic work, Red Cloud's Folk. The main purpose of this book is to make acquainted the reader with the less known episodes of the life of the great chief while it of course can be used as a comlete biography. It is for everyone who is deeply interested in Native American culture and history.A serious study from a serious historian to serious students."
5,red Cloud,I am very interested in the Native Americans. They were very much ill treated. Granted they never developed the land. They roamed like nomads. Put that aside the politicians lied to them over and over. The Native Americans are still treated as if they are no human. Red Cloud became a Christian. he tried to save his people. As Christians the politicians did not act as Christ would have us act. I find it mighty interesting that we have to have tolerence for other peoples religion but we have no tolerence for the Native Americans
4,A good book for beinners but take a look at your course req,"This was one of the first books i read on process control.Whether or not you should buy the book would depend on what your course demands.The beauty of the book lies in its lucidity which shows the authors understanding of all the sensors and instruments...the book stresses on the principles of working of all the instruments. i understood every single transducer I learnt about in the book.Another plus point of the book is that it is self-sufficient, in that you dont have to take another book while reading this one.It starts off by discussing all that you need to know about OP-Amp circuits for process control and even digital electronics.My course in Process Control demanded a very high degree of detail in most of the process control mechnanisms and transducers so i didnt find everything I needed in this book.But it covered my syllabus to the greatest extent of all the books and explained it in a beautiful manner."
2,Process Control Instrumentation Book,"The book is full of good knowledge, but the print is just the worst, the printlooks like it was run on a really bad old copier and the spine glue is very weak.I do not recomend this copy cause of very poor quality in its manufacturing."
4,Still the sickest,"If you don't normally listen to Necro - try one of his earlier CDs first to see what he's all about and than give this one a shot and you'll see how Necro's music has evolved and emerged.There is some killer (pun intended) tracks, my favorite is #1 Creepy Crawlers, complete with Charles Manson interview snippets exemplifying how disturbing he is."
3,good but dissapointing,"I have at least 6 or 7 necro albums, and this wouldnt be in the top 3. I like death metal and rap, but i cant get into it when you put em both together, its actually kinda annoying. i wish he would do more stuff like ""i need drugs."" theres only about 3 or 4 songs that i like off this album. Lyrics:B+ Beats:C-. but necro is still one of the illest rappers/producers just needs to stop trying to experiment with ""Rap Metal"""
1,Either wrong one or defective,I bought this flasher to replace the original one in my 1987 Ford F-350. Fits but is DOA. I did not bother to return it. Probably my fault for not following through with a return.
5,Buss 552/536 2-Prong Flasher,Good dependable heavy duty flasher. The one I recently purchased replaced the one I purchased almost 20 years ago. I stick with Bussmann because I get the best service. Best prices I find are through Amazon.
2,Rotating motor,"We bought this motor to rotate a hanging whirlygig in the house. I struggled to get the motor to rotate in the direction I needed. You have to insert the battery backwards. It is noisy and the D-cell battery drained in a relatively short period of time (continuous operation). To be economically reasonable, I will have to buy a rechargeable D-battery (or several). Maybe my expectations were too high but this motor certainly didn't meet them."
4,A lot of material!,"The textbook, actually a collection of lectures, provides a lot of material and examples, and it tries to lead the reader from the basics of subject to the applications of wavelets. Despite of the wide range presented by the chapters, the high reciprocal independence and the completness of proposed path, as an introductory book I would prefer the classical ""Ten Lectures on Wavelets"", even if Benedetto-Frazier work could be more suitable to get at-a-glance what people are doing (i.e. were doing at the moment of publication) with wavelets."
5,My Intro to Westerns,"Cheyenne was my first cowboy and it was love at first sight. I was all of 5, maybe. I never missed an episode and westerns became my primary interest until I hit my teens. Sitting through this old series really takes me back. The strange thing is they don't seem dated to me at all. For instance, in one episode the settlers are griping about the ""savages"" and Cheyenne sets them straight by explaining the reason the local tribes don't trust the settlers. It struck me as an unusual trait for its time; to begin setting the story to rights. I plan to buy each season as it comes out to share with my young nephew and my older kids. These are from an age when television was entertaining!"
5,Still as good as I remember,"After 50 years Cheyenne can hold its head up high. The good bloke wins, and there is no foul language or gratuitous sex or violence.The whole family can watch it and enjoy it. What a pity they lost the art of plain story telling.Cheyenne was the first of the genre and is still one of the best.Video and sound quality are great as is the presentation.Well worth the purchase."
4,Old TV Westerns,Another of the Great TV Westerns that screened back in the Sixties.Though I have never seen this back in the old days growing up. I had read many Comic books and so I have always wondered what the TV serries was actually like. I don't believe it was ever syndicated here in New Zealand. The DVD delivers on all fronts with good story lines and plenty the old cowboy action and is a must have for us collectors of the old Cowboy progammes.
2,5 stars,"Years ago I watched CHeyenne Series, when I found the complete first seasonI was so happy.When I received the videos I was very pleased with the qualityof the videos, I had ordered other cheyenne movies from another website, and was very disapointed in the quality of the picture, it appeared asthough they had recorded off the T.VThank you in Ohio"
3,Cheyenne,I like it but it is in black and white. I need the colour! If it had been in colour my rating would have gone up.
1,cheyenne the complete first season,"Its got subtitles at the bottom of the screen,my brother is upset over this."
5,Great series - can't wait for season 2,It was such a great experience to watch Cheyenne again after so many years. This was one of my favorites growing up and one of my father's favorites as well.My wife and I are watching these shows together and she enjoys them as well.We can't wait until Season 2 of Cheyenne is released and available for purchase!There is nothing on TV now that even comes close to great entertainment like these Warner Brother westerns.
5,Cowboy Yipees! Second Season coming!,"The most welcomed and long awaited announcement was recently made on Clint's Walker's website, that WB will be releasing the SECOND SEASON of the still extremely popular TV Western show, ""CHEYENNE"". As an added bonus for all this most beloved star's fans, WB will also release a DVD of another of Mr. Walker's movies, ""Fort Dobbs"". What a wonderful Christmas present for all Clint's fans...and oh boy, does this make us all happy!! Well done WB....well done Clint Walker...(Grannie hugs for all!) Y'all will have to keep checking Clint's website to get more particulars...."
5,The Image of the Old West Heroes,Cheyenne was my boyhood hero. Right up there with John Wayne as far as I'm concerned. I want every episode in my collection.
4,cheyenne first season,It was good to go back a see one of my favourite shows again. The big fella is still a standout
5,Cheyenne,"Cheyenne, Cheyenne where will you be traveling tonight. Only man Cheyenne....It simply doesn't get any better than this. Cheyenne was the precursor to Clint Eastwood's ""Man with no Name"" character in Sergio Leone's westerns. Now if Warner Bros. will only release ""Fort Dobbs"" and ""Yellowstone Kelly"" present day audiences will get a chance to see that Clint Walker was ""The Man"". Cheyenne was the baddest and coolest cowboy to ever ride the range of the small screen."
5,Classic Western!,Cheyenne is one of the classic westerns of the golden era....thankyou Warner Brothers for releasing it. Far too many years had gone by since I last saw Cheyenne. Please keep giving us more seasons to enjoy as soon as possible. I'll be there to buy them!
5,Cheyenne Rides Again !,"Yes- Yes- Yes -- Come on Warner Brothers, bring us more ! Lets have the second season and how about some of the other shows you have ? Give us Bronco, Sunset Strip, Lawman, Colt 45, and on and on. It is about time these companies wake up and realize these older shows will sell. Instead of putting so much of this new stuff out within a few months of being on television give us more of the older shows. There are lots of older people like myself that hunger for this type of release. So Come On Warner Brothers, keep them coming."
5,Great Western Stories with a Big Tough Hero,"These stories of the old west have adult themes and seem authentic. Cheyenne is a Big Tough Man that follows his convictions no matter what the consequences.Because Cheyenne roams the west he encounters a wide variety of situations that require a cool head, bare knuckles and a fast gun.The stories are consistently entertaining and I am looking forward to season 2. This is probably the best western TV series that I have seen. There have been some good ones like Have Gun Will Travel and some others but Cheyenne is the best.You certainly know where you stand with Cheyenne.Worth the price.I would like to see WB release other Classics like 77 Sunset Strip and Maverick."
2,Disappointed!,"Commercial Studio releases are NOT suppose to be missing 20% of each original episode! These episodes run as short as 40 and half minutes!!!!!!!!!!!!!Great series - pitiful release - especially for a major studio! Even Worse,the original song with lyrics has been replaced by an instrumental track - my vote for the WORST release of a great series by a major studio - the Amazon facts say running time of 780 minutes - the Boxset actually says 630 minutes- like I said - short about 10 min of each of the 15 episodes! Amazon should correct this error also - it's misleading!"
5,warner bros please wake !,why oh god why is warner bros sleeping over a gold mine called Cheyenne .Why warners failed to release the complete seasons of Cheyenne is a big mystery .Lesser Tv westerns have been released but Cheyenne has not gone beyond one season .Even other Tv westerns such as Bronco have not even got one season release from warners.PLEASE WAKE up WBs.This was the best of them all and why are you denying the best series to us.Clint walker was the Giant who resurrected warners from closing down .At least give the show a decent respect by giving it a proper release with a nice interview etc. lets be gratefull to the big guy who gave us so much joy . Thanks. Virender from India
3,Cheyenne TV - The first season,"While the quality of the transfer appears as good as possible, the actual transfer makes me wonder what is left out of each episode. Thus far I have not completed the entire season, each of the first several shows is only about 40 minutes long, a length I find woefully short for the era.I would have expected something around 50-52 minutes and there are no explanations which I have thus far discerned to explain this. That is where my ""complaint"" if we can call it that is lodged. The price was certainly inexpensive enough but I still would have expected at least an explanation."
3,Good for the price.,"Floor isn't anything special, just two pieces of corrugated plastic. Also, the walls don't go all the way to the ground so if you are worried about insects be wary, they will be able to get in through the bottom. Super easy to put together, looks nice assembled. Would of been nice if they could of included a base that zipped to the sides to make it fully enclosed."
1,"Unassembles without much contact, don't waste your $$$!","Took over two hours to assemble because the connecting points are too wide and the connections are very very loose. This makes it easy to disassemble without much contact. One of the connecting rods is too small and disconnects from it's point at will! For $50, it's not worth it. Falls apart all the tine. Requesting a refund."
1,Very Flimsy!,"Very badly manufactured, comes easily apart, extremely flimsy and unreliable to hold heavy winter coats, with just a piece of cheap cardboard as the floor. I ordered two of these closets at a time and the products together with the shipping fee to Canada were about $260, much too expensive for such bad-quality products."
3,"Overall, not the best quality.","I put this together fairly quickly. However, I went to move it and it kept falling apart (some of the poles kept coming out)! Then, I put the plastic cover on (which helps hold it together overall) however it ripped down one of the seams as I was putting it on. The plastic is fairly thin. Overall, it is holding up a bunch of my winter coats in the basement, which is why I gave it three stars - but dont expect too much!"
5,perfect introduction to digital photography,"I have used this video in my introductory digital photography class for three years running now and have found it wonderfully helpful for demonstrating in the field the full gamut of tips and photo techniques we read about in textbooks. Jim is a good teacher, crystal clear in his delivery and knowing when something is likely to be unclear without further demonstration. He also has a charming natural style of delivery that makes the viewer feel like another friend out on the photo shoot with him. The use of a wild animal farm as the setting for much of the series of shooting situations also works well and gives the lessons enough variety that the lessons always seemed fresh as we moved through the modules every week. I highly recommend his courses."
4,Great investment!,OK...this DVD really helped me get a jump on my new found passion. I love how you could compare examples of the pictures that were taken right away. This DVD broke down the basics and gave many helpful hints.The only reason I gave this 4 stars is because some of the points were repeated. I would have given 4.5 stars but Amazon didn't allow that option. I owe a lot of credit to those folks over at Betterphoto.com and can't wait for their next DVD release!!!I highly recommend this DVD!
1,Not as adverstised.,"This is not an adjustable box holder. It is an open ended, static box holder that is too big (deep) for standard window boxes. The only adjustable portion is the mounting bracket, but it is so poorly manufactured that it doesn't hold (it fell off the railing as soon as I put the empty windox box onto the holder). If you want it to stay in place, you will have to use 4 screws (not provided) to screw it into your wood railing (2 screws per mounting bracket); if your railing is metal, you are out of luck. The manufacturing is terrible - the coating on the metal is thin in several spots, and will undoubtedly cause it to rust in the near future. The holder is also not squared, and the mounting brackets aren't even the same length. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY."
5,"Deep characters, great plot, fantastic read","The Ransom is the exciting conclusion to the Matthews and Matthews series. The characters were deep, engaging, and real. The story was riveting until the end. Without spoiling the plot twists I'll just say that more than once I got a warm, glowing feeling and parts of the story brought tears to my eyes. I love a book that gives me not only an escape, but an opportunity to feel something special...Bonding with characters and wanting good things to happen to them. And yes, I even felt a bit sorry for the villain. I'm also totally impressed with how the author brought out spiritual truths in such a natural way. Nothing preachy here, just inspirational. Great read. This one is definitely worth your time. In fact, get the whole series! You'll be glad you did. I just wish there was a book 4 because I want to see Brad and Melissa happy, too. If it ends here, I don't get to see them find true love. That makes me sad. :("
4,Single catalog but great reference,"This book is merely a reprint of a single (yet large) catalog of McCobb's designs for a single manufacturer, however, the line featured is often considered the most sophisticated of his furniture. Another reference that encompasses McCobb's work is needed, but this is the best thing available if you can't find original ephemera."
2,don't bother,"This is nothing more than a catalog reprint, 'written' by someone needing to get out of the office on time. These Directional images are all over the net, era furniture magazines, and period New Yorkers. There is a willing audience for an insightful, & knowledgeable book about Paul McCobb. This ain't it."
5,Comfort and safety,Two things that rarely go together are comfort and safety. But thats what you get here. Great safety shoe at a great price.
3,Your guide.....if you have not attended a private school,"Excellent brief guide for business begginers or for those who have not attended a private school and want to improve their general manners in life. Brilliant spots on general concerns. If you do not feel sure about yourself, this is also a brilliant little guide for the millenium to succeed in public. Worth of a try. Pequeña guía básica de toma de contacto con protocolo general de negocio. Buen comienzo."
5,PERFECT for the newly diagnosed patient!,"Jami Bernard provides the reader with humor and personal experience throughout her cancer treatment journey in this book. As a recently diagnosed patient, I wanted to learn more about my new unchosen journey. Jami detailed what to expect during every step of the treatment process and provided helpful hints for dealing with not only the physical but the mental side effects from the initial diagnosis to surgery to treatment. I have read many books since my diagnosis and found this book to be the most helpful and insightful. Thank you Jami!"
2,book,"I felt that taking 10 days to get here was exessive. Book was ok, didnt realize it was printed in 1997, but that was my fault."
2,Welcome To My Garden DVD set,"Disappointing. Instruction could have been completed in one DVD. DVD #1 used up 10 min or more at the end, interacting with a grandchild. This time could have been spent on instruction. DVD #2 , which was to complete the wreath begun on DVD #1, did not show actual placement of some of the flowers/greens. It only showed the wreath after the fact. Since you are only able to see the finished wreath, it leaves you guessing at why particular greenery was chosen and why it was placed in certain areas of the wreath. I felt this was important information to have when attempting to design a wreath of your own (which is why I bought the instructional DVDs.)"
3,Good book to have,"The book gives the latest developments and views on money management and portfolio management, however, (at least to my opinion) not into detail as the previous book, The Mathematics of Money Management."
4,Addresses questions I've never seen addressed before,"This book provides a theoretical framework from which to address the topic of portfolio integration and asset allocation, taking into account reward, risk, and the often missing elements of time and leverage. Although the book is actually pretty old by now, it still would seem to be applicable to today. Even if you don't agree with Vince's conclusions, and I'm not sure I do yet, he gives you a lot to think about. Also, most traders won't even take the time and effort to work through these issues as thoroughly as needed...giving the trader who does a competitive advantage. The only reason I haven't given it five starts is that there seem to be some editorial mistakes in the book. It seems like whoever edited the book did not really have a grasp of what was being discussed and so missed some serious problems in the sentence structure. On the other hand...it could be that I'm the one who didn't understand :)"
3,works ok,does not really keep ice more than a day. Nice size and handle works good but the wheels are small so you need a very smooth surface or you will be dragging it rather than rolling it. I will keep it but not any better than my other units. I like the form factor for packing in car.
2,Igloo fails on drain,"The drain hole is 2"" above the bottom of the floor of the cooler making it difficult to drain the cooler with anything inside. Also no way to fasten the lid of the cooler so racoons can't get inside. The cup holers reduce the insulating integrity of the lid. On the plus side it is a good size compact cooler that kept better cooling than another cooler it replaced. Still looking for a great cooler for camping."
4,Great idea,"Best thing - it keeps stuff really cold.Worst thing - the wheels don't work real well in sand, nor after using in sand (not good for beach)"
5,This thing is great,"I've only used this to transport a large amout of food on a couple of short drives, so I can't attest to it's ability to keep things cold for a long time. All the frozen stuff was still completely frozen after about two hours in the cooler with no ice. I love it. It is huge, and fits a freezer and fridge (almost) full of things. The wheel/dolly design is fabulous, and from what I could tell watching my husband lift it, it was definitely easier to wield than the same amount of food in a traditional chest-style cooler."
3,Bad lid hinge,"The ice stays for only about 2 1/2 days in 73 degree temp I kept this cooler in the shade.But one must remember the ice you buy in a bagis mostly hollow so it's made to melt fast. guess why ?But! the real problem was when ever I opened the lid the two pegs to hold the lid on would slip out of their shallow hole and let the lid fall right off and into the sand/dirt.I will have to come up with a strap type hinge to correct this problem.Now for the good !!I like the depth so that higher items can stand up, I will need to make a shelf for over the ice.it's easy to handle and slip into the back of the van.I guess it deserves about three stars.Robert"
4,Rolling cooler,Nice cooler easy to handle bought it to take on the boat easily handled by one person easy to clean
4,Nice but overpriced,"The cooler is almost identical to the 60qt cooler with exception of a different lid which gives more internal clearance. You actually save money buying the 60qt and upgraded lid. This cooler would be more fairly priced at $39.99. Lastly, the colors are inconsistent. You may order it think it looks like the picture but it may be a very light blue instead of the dark one shown.Besides all that, it's a good cooler, the 60-qt is just a much better deal."
1,Nice design but fails to keep anything cool for long periods of time,"This cooler is big. It has rollers for easy transport. It even has cup holders at the top. But it fails to do the most important thing - keeping things cool. It must be an insulation de-fect or design flaw. Or perhaps it's not produced to keep things cool for long periods of time (like 12 hours or a full day). This barely kept things cool for four hours, with ice in it. Everything melted.The problem with good coolers is that someone manages to steal it from you. So I had to purchase a new one. This looked good, but upon using it once, will never use again.DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT."
3,its okay,chest is easy to handle but is very heavy when full.It holds a lot.Dont plan on having ice for five days.It aint gonna happen especially if in a hot humid area.It does hold ice longer than a standard chest.I have only tried it with machine ice.I want to see how long block ice will hold up.Cooller is the wrong term.It does not cool anything.
5,Worth the money,I got this and the regular igloo cube. This one kept ice way better. Twice as long at least. My boyfriend and I used them both as checked luggage on Southwest. Fit all our gear inside and strapped them shut.
2,Not good for the Beach,"Cooler looks and feels great however one day on the beach and the sand got in the handle and made it impossible to close it, and if the handle isn't closed you can't leave the lid open so that makes it very inconvenient. Unfortunately we had to return it. If they make something like this but with a handle that doesn't have holes I would purchase it again."
4,Before Centuries,"A very interesting ""map"" of the european-based units of USAF during the cold war, with amazing color pictures.Now, let's expect the second part, with the history of american Super Sabre in Europe..."
4,"Obscure, but really good","The band may be obscure, but the music is great. Tired of mass produced music studio formula music? These guys play good old fashion punk stuff, with maybe a hint of (was it?) rock-a-billy thrown in. Good party, feel good, high energy stuff. Just what you need to wash all that pop crap from your ears.The sound reminds me a little of Motorpsycho."
4,"it does what is needed, but the price seems high","It does what is needed to solve the immediate problem and my dad has been able to use it successfully, three times per day. Sometimes, some of the pills go flying when he tries to get them out of the slot. His fingers are a little wider than average, I think. Also, based on the materials and how things fit together, over $200 seems a little on the high side."
1,TOO MUCH FLUFF,I regret buying this book. The author spent too much time dealing with irrelevancies rather than concentrate on the core of TCP/IP. Materials in the book are very poorly arranged and the reader finds himself spending valuable time piecing information together.
2,Too many errors and poor writing style,There were too many errors and I found the writing style to be extremely annoying. The analogies were some of the worst I've ever seen. I couldn't take it any more after the first 3 chapters and bought the Exam Cram book to study from. This was the 5th Sybex book I used for studying for my MCSE and it was nowhere near the quality of the others.
2,Needs a lot of work,"After reading previous reviews, I gather people either love or hate this book. So farI haven't been able to get past the first three chapters, so I'd agree with the haters. A lot of things I have learned before about networking and subnetting are now explained in a confusing way or flatly contradict what I knew before. So who should I believe? According to the other reviewers on this site, I don't think I (and others) can rely 100% on the accuracy of the explanations offered. I do however agree that the questions at the end of the chapters are excellent."
2,"Errata, errata and more errata","There are so many errors in this book (2nd edition) that I stopped reading it after the first four chapters. If you go to the Sybex web site, they've posted about three pages worth of errata (mostly exam questions). And the errors aren't just typos - they're often completely different answers with re-explained explanations. Even after making all the corrections I'm still finding errors, so I may try to get my money back on this one. Too bad - the content is really important and useful stuff."
4,Best TCP/IP book yet,THis is the best study guide to prepare for the NT 4.0 TCP/IP test. It helped me pas the test with an outstanding score on the first take.
2,"Sample test questions are good, but that's it","I can't believe that some of you guys actually liked this book. The only thing that this text was good for was for passing the exam. I have got to admit that the questions found on the back of each chapter were pretty reflexive to those of the 70-059 questions. Having read the book a couple of times, I found Lammle's style to be annoying and that it added excess verbage to this $50 paper weight.If you REALLY want to know more about subnetting and TCP/IP, you'll find more in ""The Cat in the Hat"" (also available through amazon.com) and the ""Joys of Vegan Cooking."""
1,"Disappointing, overly wordy book does little to help prepare","I found the writing in this book overly wordy. I appreciate the authors attempts to make the subject matter less dry, but in doing so they make the information we need to prepare for the exam less accessible. They make frequent use of analogies that do little to make the material more understandable. And many of the in-depth concepts covered on the test are missing. I found the TCP/IP study guide published by New Riders (which I purchased when I found this book wasn't helping) much more useful because it was more comprehensive and made frequent use of graphics that helped explain the concepts being presented. My impression is that this book was written hastily and is badly in need of editing."
5,Yet another great study guide from Sybex.,"Many here complains about how wordy this book is, but after all guys, this IS a study guide and it's supposed to spoon feed you a bit. If you don't like this style, you should buy a reference guide instead. It covers all MS exam objectives thoroughly. I've just taken the exam, and must say, many of the questions were verbatim from the book. I'm an MCSE now, and couldn't have done it without the Sybex series. The CD is especially good. Buy it if you want to pass the exam!"
2,Hilarious to read but annoying for studying purposes,"I had just finished the Server 4.0 in the enterprise from Lisa Donalds which ended with a rather difficult subject. So when I started this book I very much appreciated the good humour at first. At some point Todd should have limited the amount of jokes because it was very annoying when trying to concentrate and soak up the information. After all I am 'trapped' in a fast track course and needed to finish the book within two days. So, my judgement would be, Todd you're a funny guy but it was just too much !!!"
2,Many ambiguous statements. can't get straight to the point.,don't waste your money on this one unless you have no other options
3,Good hands-on component. Coverage of material is incomplete,"I used this book along with SAMs ""Teach Yourself..."" series to prepare for this exam.Together, they were a good combination. I would not rely on this book alone. It was at its very best for the end-of-chapter labs which walked me through the interactions of WINS, DNS, and DHCP. (I'm from the Novell world, where IPX/SPX took care most of this for me, so it was all new ground). I agree with some of the other reviews, that sub-netting is incompletely explained."
2,Poorly written book,"This book is poorly written, making it difficult to read and understand for someone who only has basic knowledge of the subject. Many sentances could be interpreted in two ways, making it difficult to understand what is being stated. The content layout make it difficult to work out what was required to know for each exam objective. The subject of interdomain browsing appeared to completely miss the point of how WINS and LMHOSTS aids the interdomain browsing (I cross-referenced using the Microsoft Knowledge Base to find the truth). I used the New Riders study guides for the core subjects and found them to be much better in comparison. The New Riders books were very easy to read and understand, and very clearly identified what was required for the exam."
3,Good book but you would require additional material to pass.,"A good book because it helped me pass my TCPIP exam. It is very weak on explaining subnetting ,DNS implementation and other IP related topics."
2,Book stinks but CD is very good.,"This book is written in some other lingo than ""easy-to-undertand-student-guide."" I did not understand about 75% of the book. However I would pay the price just to get the CD if I were you. That much is worth the money for the book because it describes how to create subnet masks better than anything I came across. I used the Sybex Test Success (I think) to supplement, as well as ""Mastering NT Server4, 5th ed. by Mark Minasi"" which has a very good TCP/IP chapter (200pgs). With these resources I was able to pass MCSE test 1st try. This book is not what I have come to expect from Sybex, however the CD was a cut above the other CDs I've seen in other Sybex MCSE study guides."
4,This is the book to use for the TCP/IP exam,"I found this book to be one of the best study guides for the TCP/IP exam. It covers all the information needed to pass the exam. As with all test prep materials there are errors however, I found that they were very obvious errors. I would reccomend this book to anyone that wants to pass the TCP/IP exam the first time. Using this book along with practice tests will get you certified.btw- I also agree that adaptive tests are easier than the old format!"
3,Could have been better,"The authors of this book obviously know their material. But, while reading the book I felt they addressed it more towards one of their peers versus someone interested in learning TCP/IP.Their attempts at using analogies were often more confusing than the material at hand.I'd recommend this book, but only if you have previous experience with TCP/IP. Otherwise, get something written in layman's terms."
2,Terrible writing and too much of it.,"After using Sybex NTServer4 and NTWorkstation4, I bought TCP/IP. The authors filled the book with useless analogies and long winded lead-ins. The reader could not help but 'scan' each page before reading it, in order to see where the TCP/IP info might be found. Even when they were not trying to build up the word-count, the poorly structured explanations made the subject more difficult than needed. My last Sybex book."
1,Pass on this one.,"Poorly written. Poorly edited. A huge disappointment. The review questions were somewhat helpful, but not worth the cost of this textbook. Go with any of the more highly-rated books on TCP/IP. You can't do any worse than this one."
2,flawed and rambling with some good stuff,"I'm very disappointed in this book - I bought it because of thereviews and because I've used Sybex books for my MCSE. The materiallacks sufficient structure, the exercises are worthless - you can't even follow the instructions in most cases. Like most MCSE stuff, I'll have to rely on mulitple sources to ferret out the info I need."
1,Disappointing and confusing,"I simply do not understand how so many people can rate this book so high. I bought this book after reading the reviews here, and found it to be a disappointment both in scope and structure. There are numerous errors in the book (3rd ed.) which should have been caught by the editors.Also, it needs a better structure. The text sometimes just rambles on. And why the emphasis on IIS 4.0, when it's not even one of the exam objectives?The only positive thing I can say is that the witer, Todd Lammle, responds to questions and comments very quickly, sometimes within an hour!I haven't checked out any of the other books, but it would be really sad if this book is in fact the best among them.I'm going through the exam Cram book right now, and even though it doesn't nearly have as many pages, it's much clearer on most subjects."
4,"Wordy, but very useful for 70-59","I got the book on a Monday, read through it in a week, and scored 982 on the exam. The book has alot of great information in it, but it is too wordy. If you can cut through all of the bs, and concentrate on the relevant information, you will have no problem passing the test. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn TCP/IP, and pass the Microsoft test. Thanks to Todd!"
3,Not the last book purchased on TCP/IP,"Book is full of information on routing, WINS, DNS. Detailed explanation of how name resolution works. Has a great sample Transcender demo included. I Still had questions after reading the book from front to back."
3,"Rambling, digressing tale of TCP and IP","I have begun to read through the book and so far it has proven to be a disappointing start. The authors, if they understand the material well, cannot convey it in a coherent manner and often disappear into the woods mumbling about subnetting and IP classes. By all means, do NOT use this book alone; instead, use as supplements other books like ""MCSE: Electives in a Nutshell"" by Michael Moncur and the Microsoft Readiness Review. There are books (and authors) that, at the end, murder their subject matters. But it seems that Todd and Monica are already guilty of manslaughter by Chapter 2, and that does not bode well for me."
3,Not Enough,"Not a bad try. If you want to pass Microsoft's TCP/IP for NT 4, you'll probably need more than this book alone. There wasn't enough information on subnetting, and the author seemed rather unfocused, but as an introductory text to TCP/IP, it's not bad."
1,Mistakes,"Presently, I am studying MCSE courses in California. The training center suggested SYBEX product and I purchased a few of them from the center. As I am reading this book, there are so many mistakes in the book. One of the CD is not working as well. I believe it is very unprofessional to have these errors shown in the third edition. As a big company like SYBEX, should have provided much better quality than this to computer book readers."
3,English or American languages..,Is a good book but i'm not an American and it writted for American people not for europe citizen. Try other if yuor english isnt good..
2,Many relationships not explained very clearly ...,"Honestly, i don't quite like this book. I buy this one because of the comments here but it turns out that they have betrayed me. First of all, many concepts are explained with metaphors in the American style, which really irritate me. Secondly, it touches many important concepts without making them water clear. It will just leave you there in the mist. Probably, these details are not necessary in the exam. However, if you are a curious guy like me, you'll need a better one than this is."
4,"Good book, but not complete","I used this books for my MCSE exam (70-59), and I scored 896 on the exam. This is a good book, but doesn't have enough information on subnetting. You may also want to get more information on DNS if you are going to use this book for TCP/IP 4.0 (Exam 70-59). Otherwise this book has what it needs to pass the exam"
1,Looking for a great way to spend $50 preparing for MCSE?,"Go buy a dozen of beer and drink it all right before the exam - at least you'll get a story to tell your friends. I haven't rated it 1, because it seems like authors *tried* to write something. I found the style to be unacceptable and analogies poor. The book should be renamed to ""Tcp/ip for dummies"". Sorry for my English."
1,"MCSE : TCP/IP for Nt Server 4 Study Guide, 3rd Edition","I am currently sitting this exam towards my MCSE and found that some of the content whilst being useful was full of holes and that some of the examples given would not work practically in the real world.I also found that alot of the questions in the back of the chapters are either mistyped or the answer is completley wrong which would give the reader a false sense of what is correct and what is incorrect.As this is the 3rd edition I have found that amount of mistakes in this book to be of an unexceptable level. If it wasnt for the extra book i purchased ""MCSE electives in a nutshell"" by micheal moncur then I would have been very confused, I also reccommend that you do study as some part of a course so you can have tutor interaction to define what is right and what is wrong inside this book, otherwise passing the exam would be a nightmare."
1,Tcp/Ip for NT Server4,"I am currently studying towards the sitting of this exam and have found this book to be useful to some degree. However there are many mistakes within the book.Not all the information given is the definition that Microsoft use.The questions in the book are good, however alot of the answers to those questions at the back of the book are incorrect. This is when the originall question has not been mis typed.I have found this book useful in some areas, however if you do not use other study materials or attend classes I feel you will be hard pressed to succesfully pass the exam.Alot of rework is required by the authours to fix the errors made throughout the book, and considering it is the 3rd edition I feel it is unacceptable."
2,disappointed,"Throughout the book, the author is trying to be funny instead of really explaining the material. It was a frustrating book to read, and I'd wish I bought another book. Because I have experience with TCP/IP, I passed the exam, but most of the questions were not really covered in this book.MCSE, MCP+I, CCNA"
2,No thanks!,"I personally am a fan of Sandra Brown's but this book was definately one of her worst! She could have made this one better if she would have taken the time to develop the story just a little more. The whole plot begins great with Katherine taking her sister's child away from the Manning family, but then she just willingly let's his brother Jason move in and take over her life. The whole point was to keep baby Allison away from her grandparents, yet they never seemed to pose a real threat throughout the whole book. They just seemed to fade into the background without any kind of confrontation at all. If I had to sum this book up in one word it would have to be BORING!"
5,A must Sandra Brown read.,I've read all of Sandra's books and I put this right up at the top of her best. This book is only seconded by Sandra's MIRROR IMAGE. A must read for any romance reader. Jason Manning is what dreams are made of.
3,Very Sweet,"This was a good book, but typical. It wasn't one of Sandra's best, but it was still Sandra. Towards the end, it got surprisingly interesting and kept me going until the sweet ending."
4,BAD BOY_classic 50's one hit wonder,"This is a must own album because it contains Bad Boy. The others are mostly cover songs by American Artists, and although ""Marty"" does a great job, I will stick to the originals. I am very happy to get a copy of his monster hit Bad Boy.Did you know his last popular hit was in 1969 and called Abergavenny (taking a trip up to Abergavenny), using yet another stage name Shannon? Don't try to find it on cd...it's never been released. His daughter did a couple of 80's releases with the Wilde name...Kim Wilde: You Keep Me Hanging On/Kids In America..This Bad Boy was worth the price."
3,Workman-like tale.,"When Prince Stephan Reynard of Castile arrived in Willoughby, Texas, to retrieve his nephew, heir to the throne, he never expected to meet a Texas wildcat. Mandy Crawford was the adopted mother of the child in question, determined to save young Josh from the cold upbringing his father had endured. As Stephen and Mandy struggle to work out a solution, they fight a strong personal attraction.If you can ignore the fact that the ruling family would have sent lawyers to handle this situation, not the current heir, you may like this story. The writing is good, but the emotional punch is missing."
5,ATB Awesome!!! Again!,"MARRAKECH THE NEW ATB`S SINGLE FROM THE NEW PRODUCTION ""NO SILENCE"" AMAZING SOUND,AMAZING VOCES,AMAZING REMIXES!!! 100% TRANCE LOVERS!"
2,not what i asked for,Gloves weren't black & yellow. They came some funky grey color and smelled just as funky. They are rugged though.
2,Dewalt work gloves,Gloves were as described but were no better than a pair of work gloves that I could buy for half as much. I will blame it on myself for not shopping around first as I usually do but got taken on the price. I found these gloves much cheaper even with shipping than from here. I was going to return the order until I found out that I would have to pay for return shipping which would have then eaten into the savings of returning the gloves. These guys got me this time but it will not happen again. Gloves were as described but beware of the price.
4,Great gloves for the price,I haven't used them enough to be able to judge durability but they've been great for the half a dozen times I've used them so far doing light yard and handyman type stuff.
1,GARBAGE,"PURCHASED SEVERAL DEWALT ITEMS...THOUGHT THEY WERE QUALITY....I WAS WRONG!!!!!!!!!!! CHEAP $5 3 PACKS OF GLOVES LASTED LONGER. WITHIN 8 HOURS HAD HOLES THROUGH 1ST LAYER PREMIUM COWHIDE, SOON HOLES WERE CLEAN THROUGH AND I PUT ON CHEAP GLOVES THAT LASTED LONGER. GO TO MENARDS BUY PACKS OF 3 INSTEAD. I ENJOY MY DEWALT TOOLS AND I PUT THEM TO THE TEST OFFEN. RUN AWAY FROM THERE NON-TOOL ITEMS, I WILL FOR NOW ON!"
5,very good,I bought two sets of these gloves so me and my honey could use them when doing yard work..they are perfect...we have alot of rose bushes and these gloves keep us from getting stuck with thorns when we are pruning ..and also make the weedeating and hoeing and digging easier...no more blisters..nice thick material and very heavy duty..
4,"good quality, nice fit","The gloves are good quality, with reinforcements and have nice -large- fit. Like the color too..."
1,Go to Walmart!,These are the same $1.89 gloves at Walmart except they have Dewalt name on them! I know because I own the $1.89 gloves as well! You make the choice.My family of 10 is the testing grounds and we give the real world exam!
2,May be good maybe not,I got 1 pair they lasted a month before the first rip was in them so I got another pair after 2 days they ripped doing the exact same work both times.
2,SO SO glove ---- won't buy again,"After the 2nd time I used the glove, the inside lining ripped loose and seeing that it could not be fixed I just ripped the rest of it out of the glove. Overall the exterior of the glove is fine but, the inside needs more quality."
1,Junk - don't bother,"I used the gloves once for some normal gardening - cutting azaleas, hauling branches, etc.. They are total crap. Two of the finger seams on both gloves ripped where the leather and cloth meet. Useless. The funny joke is they have ""Guaranteed Tough"" printed on them........"
1,gloves,the gloves are poor in quality. I used 1 pair for 2 weeks and now they are trashed. not heavy construction just around the yard. the palm wore out as well as 2 fingers. what should you expect for $7.00 dollars. if the gloves are made out of cowhide then it must have been a thin cow.
3,"better than junk, but I was expecting Dewalt","I'm doing lots of renovating of my house, and along with the full complement of DeWalt 18V tools (which I love), I am also an aggressive user of work gloves. After going through a half dozen pair of gloves from home depot, I thought it was time to buy ""the good stuff"".Well, these lasted about as long as the rest. One day of doing demolition, and there's a big hole in the fingertip.Which I might have expected from home depot, but it made me sad because these gloves matched my tools, look ""manly"" and... didn't hold up.I'll buy them again when they are cheap, but I'm sure glad the company makes better tools than gloves!"
2,Didn't hold up,"These gloves worked well however around the cuff it is tearing and falling apart. I do a lot of work with gloves from planting new trees to wood projects to mowing the yard. I had some basic leather gloves from Home Depot for many years and they held up great until one of the fingers started to get a hole. I bought this pair of gloves as a replacement and they didn't even last 6 months. They were comfy, but not durable enough. As a DeWalt product I was very surprised to see the low quality. All my powertools are DeWalt and I love them, but these gloves were no good."
1,Cheap construction,"I have had great experiences with Dewalt tools so I figured spending $7 on a pair of their gloves was a wise purchase. Wrong! These gloves are garbage. After a couple wears the fabric and leather came apart and my pinky fingers are sticking out. Duct tape will fix that, but come on! I agree that the cheap $2 gloves at your local store are a better buy."
4,yellow is a good color,"...because they are yellow and they are new and I haven't gotten them very dirty yet or washed them yet, I can find them easy. I have grey work gloves of similar type and they get lost in my garage. Also yellow Dewalt work gloves provided a nice protection for my hands with the suede reinforced parts in the right places...I am wondering why Amazon asked me to review this and why I am..."
5,"DEWALT DPG41L Premium Cowhide Leather Work Glove With Reinforced Palm And Wing Thumb & 2-1/2"" Safety Cuff Size",They are a useful pair of gloves and reasonably priced. They servethe purpose for which they are designed.
2,Average,"I've had two of these and they are simply average. They do the trick but eventually break from wear. If you plan on jumping rope regularly like I do (20-45 mins a session, several times a week) you should get a better rope.A decent rope will not cost much more than 20 dollars (e.g. a Nike rope, which I just reviewed), but will last you for years. I have worn out one of these Everlast ropes in just a few months. The other lasted about a year before breaking. Typically ropes break either near the handle or where it hits the ground - I've had one of each type of failure happen with this rope. The handle does not have a bearing, so the rope isn't as free to rotate. Furthermore, the rope itself is pretty thin and doesn't last much wear.Sometimes ""more is less"" - if you go ahead and just dish out the 20 bucks now, you'll probably end up with a rope that will outlast several of these."
1,Terrible.,"Do not buy this product. It wears down and breaks, either at the handle or by the cord (yes, I used it so much that it wore down the rubber cord so that it broke).Do yourself a favor and spend the extra money to get a better rope."
3,"Good speed rope, but not durable","I've purchased this rope for around five dollars at my local Big 5 Sporting goods. I wanted to learn how to box and become more fit so I purchased the rope for speed training - and it performed adequately. The rope was light, fast and made of a sleek-looking plastic material so it was easy to use. My only problem with this rope is that it recently snapped at the handle as a result of the plastic rope in the handle breaking off due to rotational wear and tear. In short, you get what you pay for. The rope lasted me for about five months and now I'm looking again for a durable speed rope."
2,jump rope,Not great. You can't adjust the rope length. There is only a small plastic stopper inside the handle - no ball bearings to help the rope rotate. The vinyl rope holds kinks way too much. Don't buy this...
2,Good while it lasts,"I bought this from Ross for like 4 bucks. I liked it, until it broke after 2-3 weeks. The rope rubs at the handle and will eventually break. The rope weight is good and it spins well, so I'll give it two stars, but it is not durable whatsoever. I think other reviews have said the same thing. I just bought the Valeo deluxe speed rope, and that seems way more durable and it spins even better in my opinion."
3,Good rope but breaks too easily,"Positives are that it's a nice light rope thus easy to turn. The material is pliable, not stiff, so it doesn't kink so it's pretty good for doing most tricks. I do like the handle design as well, fits perfectly into my hands and is comfortable. Unfortunately, these ropes seem to break a lot easier than others I have used, in the worst case, actually broke on my first use. It does not seem to tolerate really fast crosses such as double under criss crosses that well. For basic skipping though, it's more than adequate."
1,Everlast? It broke after a week.,"Rope snapped at the handle, and the other side is worn through 50%, so maybe the plastic rope is too soft, or the handles too sharp.I'll put it with the Everlast Heavy Bag, which snapped its hang straps in 4 months.Ironic company name, now that I notice it."
3,A LITTLE TOO RUSTIC,I enjoyed this book but found it a little too rustic; kind of over-the-top for the average rustic aficionado. The same styles were repeated over and over with little variation.
3,awfullycutelal,Had some very interesting cabins. Liked the work. Something very original to have sit on your coffee table for when people come over.
3,Solid Not Great,"Good list of songs, especially tracks that are not easily found on other compilations (e.g., Long Tall Glasses, Welcome Back, Fallin' in Love, and City of New Orleans by Arlo Guthrie). However, one problem exists with the product. Fallin' in Love by The Souther, Hillman, Furay Band is listed as a track when it is actually Fallin' in Love by Hamilton, Joe Frank, and Reynolds, which is a totally different song (but which is equally hard to find on compilations. If it hadn't been for this sloppy work, the disk would have rated 4 stars instead of 3, and I would have bought it anyway."
1,Nothing to learn from this book,"In all honesty, I belive the author hardly has any knowledge of game development at all. I would say 80% of the book's text is theory about RTS game design --which isn't anything you don't know already. The rest is code that lacks basic features such as unit selection.If you've been modding RTS games you probably know more than the author about RTS game design/development."
1,Self Indulgent Intellectualism,"This DVD could not be interesting to anyone but pretentious film geeks and those under the effects of mind altering substances. Much of it is just fact-cut images that has no meaning. Other parts like ""America"" are so anti-Americam that it actually has the words ""Give me terrorism...I would feel more at home in the ruins.""I've heard that this stuff is actually used as a teaching tool in some universities. It's no surprise the film industry produces the lefty trash it does."
1,Flimsy piece of junk,"You get exactly what you pay for with this thing. I should have known better, and I'm glad I only got one. The moment you start to roll the rack with any weight on the bar, the whole thing pops apart like a child's toy. Then the cheap metal tubes bend, and the plastic parts crack, and you have $30 of trash on your hands, and your clothes in a heap.I learned my lesson. You can't do a rolling rack on the cheap."
3,"It's Okay, But...","This was our first digital camera purchase a few years ago, and at the time I was very pleased. But I think the convenience of not having to develop film, plus that ""new camera smell,"" skewed my perception.The start-up is ridiculously cumbersome. The shutter speed is unbelievably slow. Plus, the zoom function, if you can call it that, is nothing to speak up of. There's two levels--far and close--and nothing in-between. Very annoying.I do have to praise how nice the pictures come out. The whole Kodak Color Science thing is totally worth its snuff, because the pictures came out crisp and beautiful, with accurate colors.Overall, this is a good starter camera and will work very well for someone who wants to do more point-and-shoot stuff."
2,inconsistent quality?,"My first bulb was installed in Dec 2007, and is still running fine as of Feb 2008. However, I installed my second bulb on a different socket (on the same circuit) 2 weeks ago, and it has already burned out. I called Feit to complain, and they insisted that they could not help me out because my bulbs don't have the model number printed on their base. After offering to read off the model number that's printed on my box (ie, 50PAR20/QFL), they were very reluctant to accept this info. Strange. Anyway, after ~10 mins or so, they eventually stated that they'll ship me a replacement, and that it should arrive in 4 to 6 weeks. Yup, 4 to 6 weeks! A Final Warning: Feit informed me that they don't normally offer replacements for bulbs purchased through online vendors. I guess I should consider myself lucky?"
5,Works well - I like the bright light feature,"Too often, vent hood lighting is more for accent. The bright light feature of this bulb gives us the option of using this light beyond accenting the stove top."
5,As advertised,"Recieved in great condition, very quickly; easy to install and work great. would highly reccomend to anyone for their range hood."
2,ONE BULB NOT WORKING,"I RECEIVED THE SET OF TWO BULBS AND INSTALLED THEM IN MY NEW RANGE HOOD. ONE BULB WORKED AND ONE DID NOT WORK. I SWITCHED SOCKETS AND BULBS AND STILL THIS BULB WOULD NOT WORK. I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT MY RECOURSE IS, BUT I DO NOT RECOMMEND THAT YOU BUY THESE BULBS."
2,Halogen flood is too costly,"This is showed while buying the Baron kitchen range hood. but this will be too hot for that range hood and the same is available in home depopt for cheaper price. i don't find any defect with this. but Since even though i have amazon prime , Can't return this item. beacuse of the shipping."
2,Arrived Broken,"Although they were packed very well, one bulb arrived broken. The outside was intact but the inside rattled like small screws inside a rusty tin can. I don't think it was damaged in shipment as the box was completely intact and packed with foam peanuts. Now comes the horrible return process. I just don't think I should have bought light bulbs by mail!"
4,Too Damned Short!,"I've been a performer for over 30 years and have had the pleasure of seeing Dave Edmunds several times. Each time reminds me that I want to put my guitar in it's case and leave it under the bed. Now comes a CD that captures one of the loudest shows I've ever heard (next to Slade) to taunt me, and has me looking for my guitar case again. The only problem I have with this CD is that it's too damned short! It seems like an economy version of the shows I remember. A must own for true D.E. fans! It will help keep you ""Closer to the Flame""."
4,Great travel bag for the money.,"I just took this bag on a golf trip to Arizona and it held up very nicely. It has room for the clubs, shoes, and more. I was nervous about a soft golf bag but it is really good. The reason I gave it four stars instead of five is that it doesn't quite stand upright on its own very well. this is a feature that would be nice, but overall this is a great travel bag for the money. You won't regret this purchase."
4,Excellent Guidebook,"This ""compact guide"" is just that. It provides a general overview with details (including humorous & sarcastic examples), of the subject matter in each chapter. As a first year law student, I'm finding it an excellent ""preview"" of what I'll be up against as I try to read my casebook. Since it's now out of print, I would recommend tracking down and buying a used copy. I've already ordered its companion volume ""The Compact Guide to Tort Law""."
3,Great Toy BUT....,They baby brother and sister don't fit in the items well at all. So I would have to agree with the first post. Fisher Price please redesign these items. My Daughter loves it otherwise. She carried them to sleep the first few nights.
2,Dora's twins brother and sister,"My girls recieved the Big sister Dora and Twins along with the swing and cradle set. The twins do not fit nicely in the swing and cradle like described. They can not lay down in the crib, just sit in it. They are too big. And they do not sit well in the swing. There bodies weren't made to where you can put them in a sitting position. There limbs do not move!!"
3,Typical New Age Story,"If you took The Celestine Prophecy and the original Star Wars trilogy, tossed in bits and pieces of A Course in Miracles and Conversations With God, you'd get this book. I kept expecting Yoda to pop out from somewhere instead of the more prosaic ""Cadenas Rotas.""But- telepathy, believing in yourself (uuuuse the FORCE, Luuuuke!), walking on water for Christ's sake (no pun intended!)As the Barenaked Ladies would say, ""It's all been done before""A mildly compelling story with a few semi-novel twists. The poetry at the end was mostly of the formulaic ""moon, June, balloon"" variety. My girlfriend loved it though!"
4,Warranty,"Hi, I already got my watch and it is beautiful, but with the package didnt come any warranty or anything, so how can I get it?"
4,Excellent Book,"Thr Recording Sessions is a great piece of work, very detailed & with some real insight. Dylan's many states of mind are captured along with the anti-methodology he employs in the studio. Dylan is easily America's most important artist of the 2nd half of the 20th century & this is one of the best 3 or 4 books on him..."
3,Not normally my favorite music but.......,"I bought this album for one reason and one reason only ---- I'm a Jack Tannehill Fan and Jack sings one of the songs on the album. However, I enjoyed a number of tracks from local bands and singers popular to the NorthWest New Jersey Music scene. If you like Graham Parker you may or may not like these renditions of his songs. It really depends on if you like the way Graham sings them or you like the songs. If it's the latter then you are more apt to enjoy these versions of which some are not much different than how Graham would do them but others are quite different. Jack offers the most different and refreshing rendition with the song he does --- My opinion of course"
3,individual containers are very small :(,I was disappointed with the container as the individual days containers were very small..much smaller than any container I had had in the past. If the pills are larger you can only get a couple in there. This is NOT for someone who takes multiple pills.
4,Great pill organizer,"I really like this organizer in every way except one...the green color. The other reviewer says that she has this in every color. I only see the one color here on Amazon.com and find only blue when searching elsewhere. Regardless, one of the main things that I like about it is that it doesn't look like a pill organizer when closed. It's in an attractive case so that when you travel or carry it with you, it isn't obvious to others what it is.It's well constructed so that it not only looks solid, but is. Compartment lids stay in place without any problem, and have just the right amount of snap to them.Also, I like the fact that each compartment is big enough to fit all of my pills (8), and then some. I have tried other organizers that just fit a few medium sized pills.Overall this is a keeper."
3,"Okay shipping, way too small for any pills more then one.","great product, just way too small to store more then one pill in even a good size single pill has a hard time fitting in this case."
3,Pretty good,A bit disappointed with this dvd. It was just not as challenging or informative as I had hoped. Would not buy another from this series.
2,"Así, asÍ","This dictionary is only okay. Its main weakness is the lack of entries. I could barely find any words that I needed to do my Russian homework. When I found a word, I was happy with the information provided. Occasionally, it provided an example of usage."
4,Good book - not perfect,"To be perfect and outstanding this book should have a Audio CD with all those conversations that available in the book.But in generally, it helps a lot."
1,Easy to Read? Easy to Sleep Through!,"These plays may be easy to read but so what? As a 5th grade teacher, that isn't high on my list when my class puts on a play. I look for interesting, well written material. This book of plays definitely doesn't fit the bill. The plays are dumbed down and lack anything interesting. They will bore you, your students, and their parents. Avoid."
2,Completely Innacurate,"I just purchased this book for trip to Georgia and have to say it hardly helped me at all. It is laid out ok, but the issue that the country is changing so quickly, a 5 year revision turnaround on this book simply doesn't work. Almost all of the practical information is incorrect about transportation, museums, roadways, etc...If you are planning a trip to Georgia, this may be slightly useful for one or two sites, but you really need to consult the internet for trip reviews from other sites like Trip Advisor or Virtual Tourist."
5,2000 update on Georgia,"I have just returned a month's teaching in Georgia and found the Bradt guide amazingly accurate, current and very helpful. The author knows culture, birds, history and politics. Can highly recommend if you plan to visit."
2,Strongly NOT recommended guidebook for Georgia,"During my journey through the Caucasus, I bought the Bradt guide Georgia, trusting the Bradt guides ""reputation"".I should not have.This guide is too verbose and not clear enough, the search for the required information is not easy because buried in long paragraphs.The detail that I was confirmed in my poor opinion of this guide: a guesthouse in Kutaisi was warmly recommended and of course I've gone there...but I quickly realized that it was a brothel (!)At the end of my trip, I made the comment to the editor. I never received any response. This means that the entire editorial policy is very doubtful. They could at least answer me with a kind of automatical polite message ... But no, nothing.In short, do not rely on a reputation, you may be very disappointed.For my next trip I would defitively avoid the Bradt guides."
2,Compared with Lonely Planet... Not worth the money,"Now I know we all want to have our own adventures when going to a place like the Republic of Georgia, but this guidebook was not very helpful in doing so. It gave brief descriptions of the city, Tbilisi, but when actually walking around it was not very useful to take a guided tour with. I am mostly comparing it with the Lonely Planet Georgia, Azerbaijan, and Armenia book which always happened to make it into my daypack. This book mostly stayed at the guesthouse, hotel or hostel and gathered dust.Now on the plus side, it does have a lot of good information, I just didn't like how it was organized and had a tough time making it work for me."
5,Classic punk-rock goodness,Satanic Surfers is one of the good true remaining punk rock bands with awesome vocals. Hero of our Time has got to be one of the greatest albums i've heard. Don't let the name throw you. It's good clean awesome punk with the rawness that gets your adrenalin up and keeps you happy with good lyrics.
1,Step Bach from the brink of insanity!,"This has got to be the worst Robert Goulet CD in history. I don't care if it IS a bargain; even if it DOES have the patented smoothness you only get with Goulet's magic vocal chords (move over, Mel ""Velvet Fog"" Torme!); even if it does have moments of pure bliss... But I digress. This is the worst one. The sound quality is easily the worst, and the songs are not even close to the superb bliss of the ""Golden Classics Edition,"" which always soothes me into luxurious ecstasy -- if you want Goulet, get that one. Of course, Goulet's no Burt Bacharach -- my personal fav, the god of the crooners -- but he's fab, and this second-rate collection doesn't do him the justice he deserves."
4,"Was hoping ""This Christmas I Spent With You"" was on this one","Please help me find ""This Chrismas I Spent With You"". It is for a special person for Christmas.Thanks"
3,A close call for Sogan,"A mission that had to be a quick-in/quick-out repossesion of an arms load carried off by pirates turns to grief when the nature decides to play a part in the whole bussiness. Sogan's telepathic link to animals is of little help in this world of horrors, and the succes of the mission depends solely on his willingness to take the most ruthless and self-destroying decision.I was really waiting to see what'll happen if and when Sogan finally decided to kill himself due wounded pride, rightful reason or any reason at all. This was the one chance he got to do it - and the team saved him again. After all those horrific wounds only he seems to get (the others are about always saved by his actions), he chose to shot himself with the blaster. I was expecting a battleship to blow up with him - but nope, and he survives this strain, too.Recommended."
5,'ease of use',Maya is a complex program. This book breaks down the complexity into key features/executions. Results are achieved in a fraction of the time required through other manuals. A must have quick reference guide for serious users.
1,Its a rip off,"After 2 years use, the battery started to fail. BenQ tells me battery cannot be replaced but will offer a discount on a new camera!!"
3,New twist on the old zombie,"This is a fun and fast read. It never digs as deep into some of the things I was hoping it would, but then if it did it would not be such an easy read. For what it is, it's a lot of fun. Tim Lebbon has done a good job of this one. If you like mysterious government plots and strange underaged zombies, this might be right down your alley. If you want ultra gory horror, this is not the one. This bowls it straight down the center. It may appeal to everyone, but won't win anyone's vote for best."
3,"Two and a Half Stars, Really","I scanned the other reviews, and I agree most strongly with those who complained of the slow pace of this novel. I thought the idea was original, but I just kept waiting for something really interesting or cool to happen, and I was kind of letdown. That might just be me, because there's action and new information here and there, but it doesn't really pick up until almost the end, and I still had questions by the time it was over. Including, does Natasha's kind need to breathe? I mean, she was buried for ten years, so how did she survive? Other questions I could share would probably spoil some of the story, so I won't post them here. Still, I'd read more by Lebbon, and give him another chance or two. I also read and reviewedThe Cabin in the Woods: The Official Movie Novelization, but that's based on a screenplay that Lebbon didn't write; he wrote the novelization, but much of the story credit goes to Joss Whedon and Drew Goddard."
4,4 and a half stars,"Good book. The writing is flawless, and riveting. From the get-go, the action starts and does not let up. This is a dark, creepy read that will keep your attention throughout. I am impressed with Tim Lebbon and will read more of his work soon.This is a dark book, with some excellent graphic imagery. It's very easy to feel bad for Tom when things go really wrong--after all, he's just trying to answer some unanswered questions.I deducted a half star because I thought the ending dragged on a bit and was a bit confusing...but the first three hundred pages rocked. Worth the investment."
3,"Vampire, werewolf or science gone bad?","I like Lebbon's writing style. There are a couple of things I didn't like about Berserk. Its not very clear if this is a story about vampires, wherewolves or a military science project gone horribly wrong. I believe it is the latter although I'm still not completely sure. That in itself is a big problem. If you are looking for a good scare I can't recommend Berserk. On a scale of 5=Exorcist and 1=Alice in Wonderland I'd give this about a 2. The story essentially covers 24 hours in which the central character goes in search of his dead son accompanied by an unusual passenger. I found all of the suspense of the journey minimized by an anti-climatic ending.I liked Lebbon's writing so much that I picked up a copy of Dusk. A much better read."
3,"Good, but Lebbon is capable of better","I enjoy Tim Lebbon's work very much, but this one disappointed me. It really was a good read, so please do not think that it isn't worth buying, because it is. It was drawn out in parts and I felt it needed more ""scares"". I do know that Tim Lebbon is capable of better because I have read his other books. Maybe if I hadn't read his other books first, then I wouldn't have been let down with this one."
1,second worst zombie book ever!,"this book is just horrid and not in the good zombie way, in the who gives a fken S type of way. I wish I never pickedup this book as there are very very few redeeming qualities for this book. I would highly suggest against reading this book as it is a waste of time. at least it had an ending but i was left with a feeling of who cares. this author should not write this type of books, he should stick with dramas and stay away from zombies as he has no talent for it!"
4,M.R. Gott's Cutis Anserina Reviews...,"Tom's journey in Tim Lebbon's Berserk is grounded in parental compassion and a well developed sense of loss. Tom provides a strong emotional core, giving greater weight to the events that unfold around him. I strongly recommend this book to anyone searching for an emotionally rich unique horror tale.Click for more[...]"
4,"Wow, this guy can write!","Berserk is a unique and interesting horror novel, with creepiness to spare. This being my first time reading Lebbon I was worried that after reading such an interesting blurb on the back of the book, that it would be hard to deliver. Luckily Lebbon managed to meet my expectations and more. The book is about a man who's son ""died"" ten years ago when he was fighting in war. After overhearing a conversation about the coverups done at the place he son died, the man (Roberts) heads off planning to find out what really happened. I don't want to go too into it but needless to say there is a government coverup dealing with monsters, what are they vampires, werewolves?? Lebbon is too creative to make it so clean cut. The only problem I had with the book is that a times it can be a little slow and though I liked the ending I wanted just a tad more. But the book was so good that I'm willing to overlook those points and read more of Lebbon's work."
2,WANDERS TOO MUCH,"THIS BOOK IS NOT VERY GOOD,I LIKE TO READ A HORROR BOOK THAT HAS MORE BLOOD AND LETS YOU KNOW WHAT MONSTER YOUR DEALING WITH! I DONT RECOMMEND THIS BOOK."
2,false security,"I always trusted the Reese name for 30+ years, nothing but Reesee for me, but this #74172 hitch pin has changed my thinking. I had this pin a little over 3 years. Being a contractor, I change my hitch attachements 3 to 4 times a week, and after the first year of use I noticed that you could open this lock with any key of similar size no matter what brand. Now after 3 years, I can open it with a pocket knife blade. It becomes more and more useless as it ages. I would never trust this lock with valuables hitched, and now I only use it to move things around my construction yard. STAY AWAY from this false security."
2,It's ok,"At first when I started to use it , it left my hair so soft and straight then after a while it started to leave my hair puffy and so soft but don't like to waste money so I'm going to finish the bottle and I'm moving on"
3,OK in my hair,"I wasn't that impressed with this product when I used it after shampooing and conditioning my hair. I used it (along with a shine serum) to blowdry my hair and it left my hair feeling like it had a slight film on it. I may try it again to make sure, but otherwise it's not my fav product."
5,Not just for afro-american hair.,"I have been using this product for several years and its the best I've ever found.This leaves my coarse hair smooth, shiny and hydrated. Glad amazon has it as its hard to findoutside ethnic neighborhoods."
