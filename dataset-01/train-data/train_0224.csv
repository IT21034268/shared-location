4,"PRESUMED DEAD, A CIVIL WAR MYSTERY",I really enjoyed the story in the book. My interest was held all through the book. I was interested in the area because some of my ancesters were living in the area at the time listed in the book. The auther did a great read!
1,they lie,The product states they work with the cannon multipass f80 and it does not.As a matter of fact the actual received product states on each cartridge the products that it supports and the multipass f80 is not listed.I am out $53 and am left trashing a bunch of unused ink cartridges.I thought I could trust the dealers on Amazon and have had great success until now.I would not buy this product or shop with this dealer
1,LAME,This book is full of really stupid and useless information. Its really more like a bad joke book about duct tape. I wasted my time and money on this book. I did not learn or read a single useful thing about duct tape from this book.
3,"Funny if you like ""dumb guy"" humor, otherwise largely dull","While this book does contain a few sensible tips for solving problems using duct tape, most of the content consists of dumb guy jokes. As an occasional handyman, I appreciate the value of duct tape, having found many uses for it, from cleaning spark plugs to fixing the brake light switch on my car. However, the humor in this book is much too crude for my tastes, some of the ""uses"" of duct tape border on the cruel and sadistic. The authors are well aware of this and some of the ""suggestions"" contain a footnote that is a disclaimer. For example, on page 69 there is the sentence, ""Or, tape birds and squirrels to trees for dogs and cats."" This is of course not funny.Therefore, if you are a fan of the ""dumb guy"" genre of humor, then you will find this book amusing. However, if that is not to your taste, then you will the bulk of the book boring."
5,Love This As a Gift,My husband and I have given this book to several male friends and/or relatives. Everyone always expresses delight in receiving it. A FUN gift.
3,Hysterically funny,"Hysterically funny and loaded with sage advice. This book is the perfect gift for any handy guy or girl, on your gift list. Loaded with unique tips on pet care, household repair, fashion and travel, this is the book for you. You will find yourself asking ""why didn't I think of that""."
4,"This book is NOT intended for practical uses, but humor!","...and the humor is great as well! If you're lookin' for a book that'll give you instructions on how to build a duct tape house or a duck tape boat - look elsewhere. This book is humor-based with silly ideas like ""Gals - tape the toilet seat down with your duct tape.""It's nothing serious, but nice for a quick little chuckle - it's a great novelty gift for someone."
5,Excellent value,Does everything a high performance shielded cable is supposed to do for a great price. Belkin PureAV cables are an excellent choice for all audiophile levels.
1,not for the serious listener,"anyone who chooses dianna krall as part of their recording project is only in it for the comercial aspect of what i call commercial jazz also known as smooth jazz or better yet kenny g. music ""straight no changes""."
5,perfect,"super quick, super easy, and ive used it with a variety of 'mixers' [tuna, canned salmon, ground beef, mashed red beans and once even with just hard boiled eggs] - equally yummy with all of them"
1,Zatarain's Tuna Cake Mix,"I tried the Tuna Cake Mix, added tuna Disappointed! I then added crab to a batch, since the main ingridence is the same for tuna, or crab. Still the same, not what I expected. Your better off making these from scratch."
1,Its so Out of Touch,"This book is so out of touch with the Code book.I have to correct most of the NEC section writtenin this book, it is base on the 1993 codebook,that the section is now mostly renumbered thatwill only confused you or failed you if youused this as a preparation for an exam."
2,case cracked,"case cracked, two of the drivers were pulled from their handles, didn't return it because my son decided he could use it - poor quality. Don't buy it."
2,You get what you pay for,"What can you really expect from a screwdriver set that's so inexpensive. I like to give good reviews but this is one of those times where I just can't. When I received the toolset, the first two watches i tried to unscrew, broke the screwdriver. The quality of this product is not very good. You're better off spending extra money and purchasing a more quality product."
5,A great little set,A great set to have for those pesky little screws you encounter when opening up your computer or laptop to install memory etc..... also great for eyeglasses. The case is a joke. I took mine out and put them in an old clam shell eyeglass case.
3,"Good tools, cheep box","These are very inexpensive for the set, but if you need a small screw driver every now and then they are very good. The box is a bit cheap and will not last long, but for now they look good orginized.The qualtiy of them is good enough for my 3 year old to use the small philips to change the batteries on his toothbrush and toys. They are just the right size if your kids want to help."
1,A Box of Junk,"This set is a box of useless trash. Amazon, you shouldn't allow this sub-quality crap on your site. It is bad for business."
1,"Bent, broken, and mis-packaged","I bought this set of small ""precision"" screwdrivers to do detail work on electronics and RC vehicles. When I opened the package, I noticed that a large chunk was broken out of the case. It can be glued, but the packaging needs more padding. The real problem came when I noticed the smaller screwdrivers and one of the nutdrivers were all bent at the neck. Also, the 2.5mm hexdriver was missing. Instead, there is a second small phillips screwdriver. And there is also an extra small screwdriver that doesn't have a slot - just got thrown in, I guess. Overall, you get what you pay for. I was looking for a cheap set, and I found a cheap set."
3,good product terrible case,"The case came cracked. The tray is as cheap as you can possibly make. Although the screwdrivers seem good, and I don't need to use them very often, I'll end up with a pile of tools in a coffee can within a very short time. For anyone whose had to deal with bad cases, and I have (can you say ratchet set?) this is a pain. I wouldn't buy this again, I'd opt for something that I could store in a case that would last - this one didn't even stand up to the shipping -"
2,"Decent set, horrible packaging","While the screw drivers are certainly functional and small, the plastic packaging is a joke. Rather than having slots to securely hold the tools, it is a clear plastic insert inside the already poor case. If I didn't need the small screw drivers so bad I would have returned this in a heartbeat."
1,broken case on arrival...,"The case was all cracked up in multiple places. All the tools inside were present, but the case is useless now."
2,not useful for me,"It would make much more sense if there was 2mm nut driver instead of 5mm. Have those people ever tried their product? To unscrew 5mm with this narrow handle? It frustrates when people sell scrap they would never use by themselves. Stop pollute planet!Ok, specifically: my sunglasses (and that's how this product came out - ""eyeglass repair kit"") have 2mm nuts (I cannot imagine eyeglasses with 5mm nuts), so I could not use this kit. The only reason I did not return it - shipment costs.Seller should at least be more detailed in the item description. At most - replace 5mm with 2mm nut driver. And test what they sell.Fuller Tool 135-0916 16-Piece Precision Screwdriver Set"
1,Worst Screw Driver Set Imaginable,You're better off using a kitchen knife than buying this useless set of screw drivers. I won't even unscrew the easiest of screws because they aren't long enough at the tip. Completely garbage. You can save money getting a different set that actually works.
5,Good around the house,"If you are a do-it-yourselfer like me, it is hard to believe I went so long without a precision screwdriver set. I have found many items to use it on, including replacing electronics batteries, fixing a watch, and other small scale project. i read many reviews where customers complained about similar sets twisting and breaking prematurely. I have not found that with this set and have found it to be very durable."
3,IT IS NOT MAGNETIC! :(,Was disassembling a few gadgets and it struck me that I did not bother to check if this was magnetic.
3,Not percise enough,I wanted a set of small tools to fix my glasses and maybe an electrical item or whatever. To bad the smallest phillips screwdriver isn't small enough to fit any of the screws on my glasses. More money not well spent.
4,Good,"I have several package screw driver of this type.my father has too!some of them are 30 years old!and these stay alive more than anyother screw driver!the price is best.the reason that i didn't give 4 star two this screw driver is,first of all it doesn't have plastic handle,if you work more than 15 minutes,you fill pain in your hand!second it has bad smell!"
2,It was a blind Guess for me,"I intended to use them to dismantle cellphones, but up till now(almost 2 months after getting them) they have served for other purposes. I still can't get any of the cellphones open. I think that they are not a complete set of precision screw driver. Maybe you should make more information available to customers. But the quality of the product is good anyway."
3,Fuller Tool Screwdriver Set - Good Combination of Tools,Seems a good product. Hope steel is not too brittle only time will tell.
3,"Cheap container, ok quality","Not much to say....container broke in a matter of days.The tools are just ok, one already broke off the handle.I use it to change the batteries in my watches....or tighten the4 screws on my glasses.I'd stick with the sets available at the dollar stores....this set is worth $5 at most"
2,Hex head round out in a mater of days,These are cheapo tools. Save your money and get a better grade of metal tools. These tools are made of soft metal that will strip and round out after a few uses. I guess you get what you pay for. Not good for RC hobby!
3,"Great set, not very sturdy",The metal this set is made from is not very strong. After a few uses the tips started bending.
4,"Great product, easy to use, but the handles are a little small.","This set is great the only thing I do not like about it is the handles are too small, it hurts alot trying to get out screws that are screwed in really tight, I had to use a sock on top so my hand wouldn't get bruised anymore, oh and the smallest hexagon tool is bent on mine, it doesn't bother me because I don't use it but it's worth mentioning."
1,History lover who hates this video,"I love history and watch several documentaries and biographies. This is probably the worst one I have seen. Basically all it is is speeches and film footage rather than interviews from the experts. It starts when FDR becomes Assistant Secretary of the Navy and ends when Pearl Harbor is attacked. The last 10 minutes or so drags on his Supreme Court packing debacle. Nothing on his early life, Eleanor, World War II, Yalta or the end of his life. To the people of A&E (Biography) PLEASE REMAKE THIS! FDR is too important to have a low budget production like this."
5,amazing harmony,"the chemistry between these three performers is obvious. their voices blend like they grew up singing together, and their lyrics are fabulously singable. girlyman is a blast in concert because of the power of their songs live and the background stories they tell about the songs. you wont regret purchasing this album!"
4,No special features?!,"First, the picture quality is very good--at least on my TV. The major disappointment with the DVD is the absence of special features. Above all, an audio commentary by the cast and crew would have been most welcome. But the film is on DVD--finally! I must confess that I'm a loyal fan of actress Kathryn Leigh Scott, and she looks great as usual in this 1970 film. And with her great legs, no actress ever looked sexier in a miniskirt! ENJOY!"
4,Bare Bones...,"First off - the movie looks and sounds great. It will be a relief to those forced to watch VHS transfers.What is sadly lacking are extras - a trailer - that's it, and somewhat disgraceful given the number of hard core fans that have kept this all alive for 4 decades. Perhaps it was a assumed fans would already have what had to be said in Kathryn Leigh Scott's books. But, it is a shame that she and others are not on a commentary. A great loss indeed..."
2,BAD MOVIE,"Not nearly as good as the series. Im a big fan, but come on, this movie bites...no pun intended"
3,House of Dark Shadows kind of bloody,"I love Dark Shadows and loved that this movie was really like watching episodes. But I didn't like the bloodiness of it. It was kind of ""over the top"" for me. I'm glad I got the Instant Video instead of buying the DVD because I probably wouldn't watch it again."
2,It's time has clearly passed,"When I was a young kid, I was creeped out by Dark Shadows. In hindsight, it had more to do with forbidden subject matter to a young child and the occasional flashing of fangs rather than the quality of the show. I remember seeing this film version of the show and enjoyed it because there were more fangs, blood, action and suspense. More monster movie and less daytime soap opera. That was then, this is now.Viewing this film 40 something years later, this stuff has not held up at all. Barnabas Collins is hardly a threatening character (Van Helsing/Buffy/Blade would have iced this wimpy vampire immediately), the acting is so corny and the story is preposterous.Universal and Hammer studios monsters are timelessly endearing but this is just a curious and nostalgic relic from the past."
1,Awful,"I hated this movie and I'm surprised at the good reviews. It was just dark and sinister and killing off most of the Collins clan was a big mistake. It did not show the ""real"" Barnabas we had come to love. The 1991 series revival that Dan Curtis produced was much better at showing the angry sinister Barnabas who was also tortured, lonely and still wanted family and love. The movie just seems to reflect the mood of Curtis and the writers in the last year of the series - It's almost over so lets get rid of everybody and move on. After watching House of Dark Shadows, I can understand why Jonathan Frid refused to be in the next movie. He had class - it was time to move on."
3,Vampires????,Saw this movie as a kid and wanted it. Brought back a lot of memories. Good quality DVD ...definitely 70's but fun to watch. Jonathan Frid was the best vampire of all time!!! HA HA
2,Long wait for nothing,This is not as good as the VHS version that was oout 20 years ago. It has critical scenes that are too ark to seewhats going on. This for a bluray is a real disappointment.
5,Best Horror/Romance Movies of the 70s,"A movie that has vampires,romance,violence,evil child brats, how can you not like it.By far the better of the two Dark Shadows movies.Great acting.You almost want the Carolyn to kill that brat David."
5,House of Dark Shadows should be listed with the classic horror films,"I originally saw the series in my youth ( 9 years old ) and fell in love with it. This is ranked with my classics Horror of Dracula, Dracula Prince of Darkness and Bram Stoker's Dracula."
3,House of Dark Shadows,"I expected better. It seemed to me that the story took for granted *everyone* who saw the movie had seen the series and skipped some connecting scenes, but overall, not a bad movie."
5,Finally the classic is released,"Best Dark Shadows movie of all time, and added feature on Blu-ray! One of the best horror movies of all time."
1,Terrible transfer to Blu-ray,"My home cinema is one all my friends and most middle class folk for that matter would drool over.- 60 inch Panasonic 3D plasma- Yamaha 670V 3d receiver- Panasonic BD210 3D Blu-Ray player- Pioneer 420V Multi-region dvd player- Kef 105 speakers front and 300v rear and side- Axiom sub and centre- Bryston 4b amps- other dedicated stereo gearEven with this, this transfer was almost unwatchable. Quality is on a par with vhs, sound is miscued and fades on occasion. Colours wash out and blacks are a joke.This really upset me. I was so looking forward to this movie as I was a devoted fan of the series.If this was on dvd in black and white for $5, I would buy it. Otherwise, wait until it hits the sale bin.Good flick, not as good as some episodes of the series but good. They ruined it though with this transfer."
3,Series;,I love this series and enjoyed it as a 'youth'. I own The Beginning 1-6. Now what do I buy to continue the series?
3,Not enough of the best DS actors,No method actress Lara Parker (as Angelique). Little of Thayer David (as Professor Stokes). Enough Grayson Hall (as Dr. Hoffman). Enough Jonathan Frid (As of course Barnabas). And almost enough Nancy Barrett (as Carolyn). These five (with comely Barrett leading) are the greatest DS actors. Everyone else is second-rate. The story is good though since when where Roger Davis and Kathryn Leigh Scott an item?
5,Revue,Dark shadows is one of those campy 60s show a classic soap Opra of the time it has everything the TV show has all your favorite are here if you like classic horror this one is for you
5,foxxy/ j.r.,"there's no word to say about this movie BUT-FAR OUT...FOR BING A DAY TIME SHOW,i ran home just to see form the start...(i think the show began at 3:00 pm and i came out from school at 2:50 pm) then when the movie came out OH MY GOD !!!!."
3,Memories of Dark Shadows,"When I saw this movie when it first came out, about a hundred years ago, it gave me nightmares. This time, when I rented it, I drifted off into a sound repose before it was over."
3,Overall picture quality of film is bad,"Unfortunately during the whole 'island' scene, Jeff Clark fighting off Prof Stokes is too dark to be viewed. Don't understand the quality of the dvd since that particular scene is in the trailer and it is entirely vuable. Also, the overall quality of the video is too dark. Fortunately I have the VHS tape and can see everything clearly. I was hoping for quality at least as good as the VHS tape. Somebody dropped the ball on this one."
5,The best vampire movie?,"Forget Coppola's overblown, overstylized Dracula remake, and try this classic out for sheer gothic mood and atmosphere. Taking a small part of a plotline from the TV show, and adding lots of chills and blood, this is still one of the best vampire movies ever, using excellent real-life sets instead of the cheesy backstages they filmed on for TV. Most of the core cast returns, too, so if you are a DS fan, this is for you! The full-length version (with several missing sequences) is being feverishly sought out by fans, so that a more complete remastered DVD could someday be in the works (we can only hope!) - for info, check out the Dark Shadows restoration website. And since even the VHS is out of print, track down a used copy like I did, or wait for the TNT/TBS reruns."
2,"Entertaining, but student film level production values?","This movie is a head-scratcher. I'd be curious to learn the history behind it. It has the look, feel, and polish of a student film. Scenes start and stop abruptly. Music cues come to an abrupt end as if there wasn't time in post production to do a proper transitional fade. Audio is sometimes out of synch -- again as if not enough time in post production. There's very little coverage -- many scenes are shot with only one camera set-up. Apparently it was shot on 35mm but looks to be 16mm.The lowest budget Hammer horror film is ten times more slick and professional than this movie.It almost seems like a two-part TV episode with a little more blood than usual? If you were to place it in that category, it's a worthy endeavor. But otherwise the production values (aside from the interesting location work) are student film level quality.On the other hand, the DVD transfer is top notch... for whatever that's worth."
5,THE BEST ALBUM OF 1995......MAYBE OF THE 90's!!!!!!,"This CD is so cool. I could go on and on with like 1 billion reasons y u should buy this album.....but i'm not gonna. I am a magical genie if u didn't already know and of coures from being that, i never lie. Also if u say this review was helpful 2 u good luck will come your way and if u buy this album even more good luck! thats a graet deal. Y not say that its helpful now!"
5,interesting,"Gwen Stefani has a great voice. She has a unique style that you don't hear to often. This is the type of music to listen for getting away from the same o' stuff you hear everyday. It all starts to sound the same, and I guarantee this is worth buying. And to all the other reviewers who made comments about her makeup, sorry, but that has nothing to do with her voice. Who cares what she looks like. She can sing!"
5,"Brilliantly original, definitely not ska music!!","This album is incredible. I used to hate No Doubt, but as I got older, I decided to give them a chance. Much to my surprise they are incredibly talented. This album cannot be put into a category, since it's such a great mix of everything. It's definitely not ska music, cause ska sucks and that's why I initially stayed away from this group. Anyways, give this album a try. It just may surprise you."
5,The kewlest CD I own!,"This CD is soooo awesome! I don't know of anyone that doesn't like it! From the moment I got it I was in awe. Not only is Gwen the best alternative singer I know of, but the rest of the band is also slammin'. If you visit their website you can find out for yourself that they're not only teriffic musicians, but nice, down-to-earth people (and still manage to be cool)"
4,No Doubt's Best Work,"""Tragic Kingdom"" is an excellent album with great songs. I guess you would call this ""Ska"" music, but it's just great alternative rock. Gwen Stefani has a great voice, but it can get annoying at some points. This is also the last album they did with Greg Stefani (the founding member) before he left the band. The albums after ""Tragic Kingdom"" gradually get worse. ""Return of Saturn"" is a contender for this one, but ""Rock Steady"" just plain [stinks]. If you buy this and like it I suggest that you get the debut album, ""NO DOUBT.""You know that some bands get worse with age, No Doubt is one of them. Don't buy ""Rock Steady."" Instead, get ""Tragic Kingdom."" You'll thank me. I give ""Tragic Kingdom"" four stars because Gwen is so annoying. They need a new singer that won't hog all the fame. Let Gwen do her horrid duets with Eve and Moby. Make No Doubt a real band again. Ditch Gwen."
3,Better than I expected,"I didn't expect much from No Doubt. I heard a the catchy ""I'm Just a Girl"" and liked it, but didn't think there was much to it. I was wrong. ""Tragic Kingdon"" has a lot of energy, four or five decent songs, as lite ska-pop goes, and a good lead singer. Gwen Stefani actually reminds me of a female David Bowie circa earler 70's (and I'm not trying to be redundant by saying a female David Bowie). Nobody else seems to think this, but listen to some of the fast numbers on Bowie's ""Pin Ups"" and see if you see what I see (er, hear what I hear what I ... you get it)."
2,Don't buy this c-d!,"This c-d is awful! Gwen Stafini has an awful, screechy voice. The only songs I like are: Spiderwebs, Just A Girl, The Climb, and Don't Speak. The only reason I bought this stupid c-d was because I liked: Spiderwebs, Just A Girl and Don't Speak. So if you only know those songs, don't buy this c-d! I would borrow from a friend to see if you like this c-d at all. One more reason I gave it two stars was because it had the words to the songs. But in my oponion, this c-d is SOOOO bad!"
2,Just another American ska album,"Total dissapointmeant for me. I don't understand why this band is so different from other skas such as Smash Mouth or Sugar Ray. What music critics will talk about the in another 20 years? This band is declared for me as the ""Don't Speak"" band. Being a blonde-sexy-female-singer is not necessarily saying that your band is much better than the other ska bands."
5,YAY!,Got the product in no time in fact it arrived quicker than I thought.I had forgotten that I purchased it new so when it came shrink wrapped I was pleasantly surprised!This is going to make a perfect Christmas gift!
4,Rockin' the Alternative World,"This CD is the coolest, if you like No Doubt famous songs! If you want new stuff by them, chaeck out thier new CD, ""Return to Saturn""."
3,No Doubt...... that it is alternative,"What I think of this cd is that i use to really like this band but now since im more of punk/ska person i dont listen to it at all. I mean i dont hate the group. This band may be ska but it is no the kind of ska that i like: Voodoo GLow Skulls, Reel Big Fish, etc. I would recommend this cd if u are into female singers(not Shirley Manson) who sing somewhat of ska. This is for people who also like Save Ferris."
4,GOOD CD,"ND is a totally unique band with a sound all its own. Even though they aren't that popular any more their songs still have a huge effect on me. Sunday morning is an excellent song and i didn't here anyone say anything about it. Ok, the worst songs are the climb and you can do it. these songs seriously jack up the cd. overall, it's good."
4,I really dig this cd,"I got this cd when I was in the 5th grade. <im going into 10th now> and I still love listening to it. Gwen's voice is so unique and so pretty I could kill her for it. But, anyways, My favourite songs are *just a girl*, *happy now*, *differnet people* *the climb* *sixteen* , *sunday morning, and *tragic kingdom* every song is listenable (if thats a word) though, so the cd is well worth it. Do yourself a favor and buy it."
5,What can I say? NO DOUBT RULES!,"Hey,This cd was the best ever! You should buy it! The best song on it was Just A Girl ( Number 3) or Spiderwebs (1). I also like Excuse Me Mr.(2).If you wanna listen to some fun rock then buy this cd!"
5,A really great listen,"This is one of my favorite albums by this group. My favorite is their self-titled debut album. On this CD, my favorite songs are Different People, Don't Speak, Just A Girl, Tragic Kingdom... well, the whole CD, really. Whenever I'm looking through my CD binder, I always find myself putting this CD or No Doubt's first album in my CD player."
4,Thoughtful,"Amazing music by No Doubt. Though they have become increasingly popular, I think it is partly because they have compromised their edgy/different personality to do so. That is why I like their early music, like this CD, so much more.It's a perfect antidote for bubble-gum music, with songs about all different kinds of things. Though you may buy it because you like one or two songs on it, all the songs, I thought, were pretty good. You could tell a lot of thought had been put into them.A classic."
5,TWO THUMBS UP!,When I first heard this album I thought it was good. Now I think its great. And Spiderwebs is on of my favorite songs of all time. WAY TO GO NO DOUBT!
5,Magic Kingdom,"No Doubt came from out of nowhere to reach the top of the charts with this ska-tinged cd. The album is a therapy session for lead singer and main songwriter, Gwen Stefani. She and bassist Tony Kanal were a long time couple and just prior to starting work on the album they broke up. Gwen wrote many the songs about the demise of their relationship. ""Excuse Me Mr."", ""Hey You"", ""End It On This"", ""Happy Now?"", ""Don't Speak"" & ""Tragic Kingdom"" all deal with Gwen's hurt over the break up. In songs like ""Spiderwebs"", ""Just A Girl"", ""The Climb"" and ""You Can Do It"", Gwen is trying to cope with life after the breakup and her anger towards Tony. Matthew Wilder, who was a one hit wonder in the 80's, tempers the heavy ska music the band played with a more accessable sound. The songs are about the hurt and anger of a broken relationship, but the music has a bright and sunny feel to it. In the tradition of Fleetwood Mac's Rumours, the tensions between former lovers create great music."
4,Different...,"I bought this after hearing Don't Speak, which is still my favourite song on the album. And I'll admit, when I first listened to the CD, my initial reaction was ""weird"". But I always give a CD a second chance, and as I listened to the songs again, they really began to grow on me. Now they're almost addictive, and I frequently find myself humming one of the many songs which I love. It is now one of my favourite CDs and I have since went on to buy other No Doubt albums too. I have about 7 favourites, but only one song which I don't like (world go round) which is pretty impressive. Also, the songs cover a very wide range, which means it covers a wide range of tastes. There should be at least one song which you love. But probably more."
3,A pretty good album,"No Doubt is my favorite band because they are innovative, always changing, fun..and they make great music. Tragic Kingdom was one of No Doubts biggest hits because of its catchy tunes. Tragic Kingdom has some great songs like ""Dont Speak"", which is there biggest song ever. ""Sunday Morning"" is probably my favorite No Doubt song ever. ""Just a Girl"" and ""Spiderwebs"" are also good songs...but the other songs on here are mediocre to me. This cd is pretty good but not as good as Return of Saturn and my favorite Rock Steady. Some of the songs go on for too long...and some of the tunes can get a little annoying. This cd was a huge step from there self-titled album and The Beacon Street Collection...but just not as great as there follow-ups. This cd is still a must for any No Doubt fan...or any music fan."
3,It Doesn't Blow Me Away,"Tragic Kingdome seems like the most hyped recording by No Doubt. With all those singles: Don't Speak, Spiderwebs, Sunday Morning, etc.... I thought that this CD would be a classic. Somehow, it is not.The thing is that in addition to the five singles there are ten other tracks. And many of them just do not do anything special for me. I think the hooks are less memorable as on Rock Steady and The Beacon Street Collection. Sixteen is an exception as its a fairly catchy new wave rock tune. Different People has a nice jazzy beat to it with good horn arrangements. And the title track has some interesting textures to its style.Therefore I count the recording as about a fifty fifty split between good songs and nothing special ones. Therefore three stars seems like the right rating."
5,one of the best,"This is one of my favourite albums of all time. The themes are consistent through-out the entire album, and references to DisneyLand are hidden through out. This is one of those cds you should have on a top 200 basis, especially if you love 90's music. The singles on this album are superb, but even the non-single tracks are awesome. The title track is epic. Also good are Happy Now, End it On This and World Go Round. Classic Ska, Classic 90's, and just good stuff all around."
4,"No doubt, they are good!","Although ""Don't Speak"" was terribly overplayed on the airwaves, (so much so, that after a while I used to change the station whenever it came on) this album as a whole is excellent. I enjoy it more now than I did when it first came out. Gwen has a voice that is different from the run-of-the-mill girl vocalists these days. And the band is very talented, the songs are melodic with great riffs and hooks throughout. No Doubt are one of those bands that write, play and sing their own songs. True talent. The booklet contains all lyrics and lots of photos."
4,One of those things you either love or hate,"Although Gwen Stefani seems to be a bit of a prima donna, she has a great voice and the band has a totally unique style that no current artists can obtain. However, I can understand why some people don't like Tragic Kingdom; it's just the type of music that some people adore and others can't stand. I personally adore it."
5,cool and modern,"No Doubt is one of the only modern bands I like- I'm mostly into oldies, although I'm a teen- and I think their music is catchy and overall cool. My favorite songs in Tragic Kingdom were Spiderwebs, Just a girl, and Don't Speak."
4,great party music,"it's wonderful to finally see a woman who is singing about what it's like to be a female in the 90's. Gwen is beautiful and talented, and singing about the things that bother her in todays soceity, without selling sex. If your into up beat music and just want to have fun the you should really pick up this cd. It's a real good time. I love it and i thing you will too."
2,this CD is sooo OLD!!!!!,"Look, this CD had gotten old, i admit a couple songs were good when they first came out, but now i hear it on the radio and i CRINGE!!!!!! if you want you can buy this CD, but after a month, you will be sick of it."
3,good but very overrated,"honestly the singles that were released are the only great songs on this record, even though this was when no doubt was at their commercial and popularity peak. The rest of the record sounds too overproduced for me to enjoy. I would recommend getting Return of Saturn and Rock Steady instead, those albums are masterpieces and much more friendly to listen to, or get their greatest hits. Don't Speak is however one of the best pop/rock anthems of the 90's and spiderwebs was funky. They sure had well done videos at the time this record was released and gwen became a fashion pop culture icon for her unique style, but musically, their creative peak was in the 00's with the 2 follow up albums and I recommend those before checking this one out."
3,couldn't listen to it everyday..,"I bought this when I was really little, around like 8 or 9, and I hardly knew any better. I bought cds because of their hits, and I think that everyone I knew bought this cd because of Spiderwebs and Don't Speak. To this day, I have never been able to listen to ska, I don't know why, maybe some day I'll like it. So, I tried listening to this cd again, and I couldn't. I just kept on going on to the next song, and then the next, until I got to a song that was played on the radios. I don't know what it is. So if your someone that doesn't get turned on by ska, I don't really recommend it. Keep your money and buy a better cd."
5,Great Pop-Ska Cd,"This cd, which richly deserved its diamond status, brought ska and No Doubt to the peak of popularity. While the ska fever has died down, this album and band remain vital in the music scene. This album is, for the most part, a happy affair. Gwen Stefani is for this band what Christine McVie is for Fleetwood Mac, someone who can make bouncy songs even about depressing subjects. Anyway, this album is fantastic. The title track descends into a cacaphony of clashing instruments, and other tracks, such as ""Don't Speak,"" ""Sunday Morning,"" ""Spiderwebs,"" and ""The Climb"" are also spectacular. If you don't own this album now, what are you waiting for? Buy it, listen to it, and love it."
1,the album that gave ska a household name,"first of all i'd like to start of by saying that no doubt is not and never will be a ska band. for some real ska or ska punk bands try listening to the pietasters,the toasters,skinnerbox,the gadjits,issac green and the skalars,the busters,the specials,the slackers,desmond dekker,op.ivy,the skoidats and many many more."
2,Awful!,"The only songs I like are Just A Girl, Spiderwebs, Don't Speak, and The Climb. That's all. She has the worst voice in the whole universe. I don't know anybody who likes this c-d. At least it has the lyrics! So I would borrow this c-d from a friend first before you buy it! In my oponion, this is the worst c-d I will ever own!"
2,Boring,This cd is good at first but after a while it starts getting extremely boring. I dont recommend this cd. If you want to listen to a female vocalist garbage is much better.
1,one star is one too many!,"This CD and this group SUCK Any one who catogorizes No Doubt, Gwen and their sell out music into ska must be smoking!!! The C.D. ""No Doubt"" was some what tolerable, but Spider Webs and I'm Just a Girl make me barf! This C.D is far from being good music and even farther from being ska!!!"
5,Im not under 13 it just wont let me review otherwise,hmmmmm 10 million records sold says it all dont you think?
5,Changed the face of music,"Up until ""Tragic Kingdom"", Ska/Pop type music was unheard of in the mainstream. After the release of the song ""Just a Girl"", all of that changed. It opened the floodgates for a wide variety of bands with horns.Back around 1995, when this album was released was when I actually liked Gwen Stefani. Her voice was excellent (has gone downhill since), and she just had an attractive energy about her. She was the single reason why No Doubt surfaced on the scene.This album, Tragic Kingdom, was a masterpiece. I can listen all the way through, without skipping a song. Standout songs are, ""Just a Girl"", ""Spiderwebs"", ""Sunday Morning"", ""Don't Speak"", ""Happy Now"", and ""Different People"".A must have!"
1,the worst album ever,"this is the worst recording possible.""NO DOUBT SOLD OUT"" with their crapy single ""dont speak"",thats what gwen should of done.the only good no doubt song in the world is ""total hate""...because bradly nowel of sublime is in it...so everyone go out and buy some real music"
2,No Doubt ...,"This CD is pure pop w/a bit of Ska mixed in. The ska is what saves it from being horrible. I do like Excuse Me Mr, has a more punk feel and Don't Speak is a terrific little love ditty. Have you seen this band live? Ugh. I had to leave their Halloween 96 show because of Gwenny's screeching. Maybe she's taken voice lessons, but that show was horrid. Luckily Face to Face made it worthwhile. She was hot when she had some chub, but now she's not so hot w/this ... glam look. I will never purchase another No Doubt CD and this one's going to eBay. If only they kept to their more-ska roots instead of where they are now as rulers of the POP world in cutesie punk/ska/rockabilly clothes. They remind me of the term sell-out."
1,1.5 Stars,"This CD isn't so great... the only really good song is ""Don't Speak""... it's a shame, I was hoping for more songs like it, but they are all ""strange"". I should have known better than to get a CD with rotted peaches on the cover! Oh well... at least it DOES have that one song on it..."
1,Paid for NEW...got USED,"The CD that arrived was clearly used. There was no security strip present on the top of the CD, the shrink wrap was loose and did not look original, the inside cover booklet had a bent corner and cracks/creases down the binding (like it had been opened many times). If I ordered a used CD this would be fine but I ordered a NEW CD.Luckily, Amazon refunded my purchase immediately!"
1,one great song,aside from don't speak which sounds like the greatest song that madonna never did this group is way overrated.the album is boring and the singing is awful.
1,"Horrible, Only 1 Good Song","I hate Gwen's yelling, screeching vocals and all the songs accept for ""Don't Speak."" The dance/pop band Clueless does a decent cover of ""Spiderwebs,"" but it just sounds like a lot of noise by No doubt."
4,Great New Wave/Ska Revival,"I listened to this for the first time in a long time recently and was pleasantly surprised at how good it sounds.This is the ultimate No Doubt album - terrific sound of ska/new wave/pop. Listening to this album again during our present penchant for 80's revival made me realize that ""Tragic Kingdom"" was about 10 years ahead of it's time.""Spiderwebs"", ""Excuse Me Mr"", ""Just A Girl"", ""Sunday Morning"" and ""Don't Speak"" are all great singles.Hopefully this band will truly return to their great roots and return to this fine form in the near future...I think it's the perfect time!"
5,MY FAVOURITE CD EVER,"""Don't Speak"" was my first song that i learned in English, after that i try to undestand the rest of the ""TRAGIC KINGDOM"" cd and as result i love this cd. ""SpiderWebs""""Just A Girl"" ""Excuse me Mr."" ""Sixteen"" ""Tragic Kingdom"" and ""Different People"" are amazing. Buy it."
5,very nice,"Nice looking, heavy weight - a nice complement to the hardwood floors. I like it a lot - might buy a second one."
4,Prompt shipping,Shipping was prompt and condition was fair. I do not remember any mention of notes being written in the margins on the description of this book. I am quite happy with them in any case but would want to be aware beforehand.
1,A RIP OFF,I WAS EXCITED THAT THE BOLTON BROS. WAS SUPPOSE TO HAVE A NEW CD. SO I BROUGHT THIS NOT LOOKING AT THE SONG TITLES AND GOT HOME TO FIND OUT IT WAS THE SAME MATERIAL FROM THE LIVE SETS DONE IN ATLANTA AND MOBILE. I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED. IF IT WAS TO BE A REPEAT OF THE SAME MUSIC ALREADY OUT IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN STATED SO. SAVE YOUR MONEY..IT IS NOT EVEN THE BEST SONGS OFF THE LAST CD'S.
2,Appetite for Talent,The sad thing about the album is that it is the best thing they have had to offer. I think Rocket Queen is the best song they have written. Axl can't sing. The drummer blows. Slash can't make it out of the box and his tone sucks. The bass player failed at guitar and continued his tradition on the bigger guitar with two less strings to screw up. I saw them live and had to bail.
1,NO HALL OF FAME BAND-C'ON MAN,"I don't like this band, they've had maybe 2 or 3 songs worth anything, I'm just venting about this band being put into the R&R Hall of Fame. give me a break, U gotta be kidding. This is NO hall of fame band and everybody knows it."
1,its been said perfectly before...,"Squash 'n squeek a couple of guys behind me has said it the best, this album is the most overrated of all time. I think that the reason that it is popular is because Guns 'N Roses made a genre like Metal more tangible in the public eye, when there where many more talented metal artists out at the time, before, as well as after. I do not think that they have enough talent as musicians to be considered so great. They made songs with some good aspects that I feel are way overclouded with the bad ones (and there are a lot!). They are just drug addicts with no substance to theie musc, and they have maybe one or two decent songs. I'm sorry but this gets a one star review in my book."
3,hindsight,"G n' R should remaster their whole catalogue and make it richer, less tinny. Then, this truly would stand the test of time. Damn good musicianship here. Good songwritin' too!"
4,Overrated,"Gun's and Roses is one of the most overrated groups that ever. This album, though, is good enough. Axl Rose is a jerk who must make himself feel better by damaging others. If you want a real group then go look at Nirvana"
2,So so,Guns and Roses would be a good band if Axl Rose's singing didn't sound like a MOSQUITO buzzing in my ear at loud volume.
1,"""THE BEST DEBUT ALBUM OF ALL TIME""?","Reality check.The Velvet Underground's first album was released in 1967 - This album inspired everyone from David Bowie to the Clash to start playing music, and has proven to be much more influential than Appetite For Destruction.And if you think Appetite for Destruction is the best debut album of the last 20 years...Reality check.Pearl Jam's 'Ten' was released in 1991 - Is almost every band on the radio trying to sound like Pearl Jam? (creed; nickelback; default, etc..) or Guns N Roses? Exactly...Best debut album of all time? Not even close."
1,It's not the 80s and hair bands are not cool,"Let me tell you something. This band was never ""cool"", and just because they were a bit famous back in ""their day"" doesn't mean they are good. Just because they got a couple of videos on MTV doesn't mean they are worth jack now. Times change, and now MTV only plays GOOD rock music and these losers are nowhere to be seen. I've never listened to this album but I can tell it sucks just from looking at pictures of the band. None of the rockers on TRL or the mall look like these guys so that means they must be bad. If you don't look cool then you can't produce good music. That's why Beethoven sucks. Thank god Nirvana saved music in the 90s."
1,"Totally unoriginal, stinks to high heavens","I got this album due to its repuation as being the greatest metal album of all-time, yada yada, but I was sorely disapointed. This CD stinks. It is plain to anyone with ears that Guns N' Roses is just a huge rip-off of Creed. ""Welcome to the Jungle"" is a third rate ""What if."" ""Sweet Child 'O Mine"" is a poor man's ""With Arms Wide Open."" And the list goes on and on. That hack Axl Rose is such a Scott Strapp wannabe it's not even funny. All of Slash's solos are straight out of Mark Tremonti's songbook. Anyone who says this CD is good doesn't know a thing about rock n' roll."
1,guns and posers,you posers. this is pop music. good chgarlottoer is real metal!Welcome to the junge is the worse sogn eva. i hate that song! dlisten to the collerst song in the world: old mcdonald. now that real rocks!
1,Peice Of Mutilated White Trash,"Guns 'N Roses pulls the limits when they decide to spread their ignorance and machismo onto the young minds of the world. This disc is just a negative effect it has on bois and grrls, that says the male needs to be the boss, that 'real men' hit women and 'real rock stars' must have 20 body guards to feel important, homosexuals must be hated and that people outside the white race not to be dealt with. This disc and this band is the scab of rock music, a mosquito bite, the in-laws that just wont go away. Axle Rose is a sham and a fake, he sould be welcomed into the jungle and shot for his ignorance, stupidity and egotistical way of being."
5,One of the best Rock N' Roll albums of all time.,"This is pretty damn near to a perfect rock album, it's raw, dirty and it gets you with the opening chord from WTTJ and doesn't let go until the end of Rocket Queen. This includes the ""Big Three"": ""Welcome to the Jungle"", ""Paradise City"" and ""Sweet Child o' Mine"". But there's more ""It's so easy"" has a great vibe to it and is a really fun song that shouldn't be taken too seriously, ""Mr. Brownstone"" again has a great vibe to it and talks about drug addiction and how it starts from doing little until little won't do, ""Nightrain"" a pure Rock n' Roll track about a really cheap booze called nightrain, ""Rocket Queen"" song about relationship with an older woman that starts off as a rocker then changes to a ballad in the middle. What the hell am I blabbering about here? You have to hear those songs and others on the record yourself! Get this album NOW!!!"
5,One of the greats,This is one of the greatest records of all time. 80's metal fans should already own it.
1,Buy the unedited album.,"Appetite for Destruction is arguably the best debut album of all time. The ""censored"" version is not very good. Most of the material is very poorly censored and although I respect the idea of censoring the music, I don't support it - because frankly kids should not be listening to Guns N' Roses, and if adults have a problem with mild language (and it is quite mild here) they just shouldn't be listening to Gn'R! Sometimes profanity filters are good (such as the one I purchased for my television for family viewing) - but editing a hard rock CD isn't a good idea since the content to begin with is pretty hardcore. I mean, the very idea of censoring ""naughty words"" from ROCKET QUEEN is hilarious - forget about the recorded female orgasm that plays midway through, just make sure they don't say any bad words!"
5,A true classic,"When you hear something special you know it. When you see something you know it. This is the single best debut album in the history of rock. There is no comparison when it comes to something that is an absolute success. The album came out in '87 but was not an overnight sensation as a number of records are. This one didn't explode for nearly a year and explode it did.Welcome to the Jungle, My Michelle, Nighttrain, It's So Easy, Mr. Browstone, Rocket Queen, Sweet Child O Mine, Paradise City the list goes on of amazing hard hitting rock n roll. This is a true must have record and if you are young and want to hear what a truly amazing album is this is it. Down, dirty and hard! Nothing compares to this in terms of what hard rock truly is and is a masterpiece."
5,Brilliant!,"Incredible. As if you don't already own this!! Well go ahead, get the track listing, write it down in order, and go download it you sillly little freak!One of the best straight up rock and roll albums of all time. If you bought this in the cassestte era, you already know that the first side is an absolute classic. This album influenced everyone who has heard it. HEY YOU- YOU HEAR IT NOW..."
5,Rock & Roll,"With 1987's Appetite for Destruction the Guns & Roses brought back to Metal what it always was supposed to have been.Rough edges,spiteful vocals,ever pounding drums and an attitude of sheer defiance towards the world.Heaviosity in rock was back,decrowning the hair metal gods like Poison and bringing back the transgression present in Megadeth's and Metallica's early works.They even managed to be radio friendly(Sweet Child O'Mine)at the same time that they wrote songs about heroin(Mr Brownstone) and prostitution(Welcome to the Jungle).And they were global,sold millions and carried themselves with an unthinkable swagger.Above all they had their music to back their attitudes with each track of teir scorching debut ultimately achieving classic status and entering rock's mythology."
5,WOW!!!!!! rock n roll at its best!!,"When I got this cd I was totally blown away. The bands song writing on this album is one of the best Ive ever heard!! The songs on this cd reflect the bands life in L.A.. Its awesome to hear the song Sweet Child O Mine in the midst of all the sex, drugs and rock n roll that is the rest of the album. This record is one of those that you can listen to over and over and not get sick of it. Between Axls song writing/singing, Slash and Izzys guitar, Duffs bass and Steves drums- Guns N Roses have created one the best rock n roll records ever!!!"
5,The Greatest Album of all Time,"In my opinion, this is the greatest album of all time. I first brought this album as an 8 year old back in '88 and it still rates as my favourite album. No filler tracks on here. The album opens with the famous 'Welcome to the Jungle' and ends with the awesome 'Rocket Queen'. There is not one bad song on this album, Still the only album to this day which i can play from start to finish. Hopefully axl and slash can reconcile their differences because they complement each other. A must have in any CD collection"
5,Best Of Guns N Roses,"This album is probably one of the best Debut albums. This and Kill Em' All, but anyway it is awesome. Its probably gnr's heavyest albums and it is really good. Slash is awesome and axl's vioce is good. I dont really know wut else to say. Overall its an awesome album and i recommend you buy it."
3,What A Debut!,"""Appetite For Destruction"" is one of the biggest selling debut albums of all time, with 15 million copies sold, and in my opinion, is one of the best albums of the 80's. With this album, and the hit single ""Sweet Child O' Mine"", Guns N' Roses began the success of whom many people consider the best rock band of the 80's and 90's. The highlight of the album is clearly ""Sweet Child O' Mine"", but ""Welcome To The Jungle"" is also a great song."
3,The only GN'R album you'll ever need,"This album is the only GN'R album you'll ever need. It's got ""Welcome to the Jungle,"" ""Sweet Child 'O Mine,"" ""Paradise City"" and some good album tracks. I've dropped a couple stars because singer Axl Rose sounds like Ozzy in the late 70's, and in my book, that is not a good thing.This is a must have for any GN'R fan or lovers of late 80`s hair metal."
5,THE GREASTEST ALBUM OF ALL TIME,There is no better rock vocalist than Axl Rose. The twin guitar assault of Slash and Izzy is incredible. Duff Mckagen is the man. Steven Adler's steady beats are kick ass. Possibly the greastest debut album of any rock n roll band and dispite the break up the band lives on. AXL JUST ASK SLASH TO COME BACK AND YOU GUYS CAN ONCE AGAIN DOMINATE THE ROCK SCENE!!!
5,One of the Best,I grew up with this album and it's in my top 5 ever. In my words and in simplest of terms..............PURE ROCK AND ROLL. A must for everyone.
3,The definition of true Rock & Roll !,"I am more into metal but Guns 'n Roses' Appetite For Destruction tells me what Rock 'n Roll means.Be sure to check out their twin album Use Your Illusion I/II! It's a compilation of Hard Rock, Ballad, Rock 'n Roll and Punk, whoaw can't miss that!"
5,The best Album ever,"I can certainly say that Gn'R's appetite is the best album ever recorded:Put the best musicians on their fields: such as Slash and Izzy on guitars, Axl on singing, and a very original and great rhythm section by Steve and Duff.Make them write the best songs they can: Fast (You are Crazy), heavy (Welcome to the Jungle), melodic (Sweet Child O' Mine), bluesy (My Michelle), angry (Out ta Get Me), hard (Nightrain), pouding (It's So Easy), experimental (Rocket Queen) and exciting (My Michelle).Write the best lyrics for this songs: true and real lyrics, talk about the streets (Welcome to the Jungle), drugs (Mr. Brownstone), sex (Rocket Queen), all what rock n' roll is really about.Get the best presentation for the album, the best producer, and you get the best recording you can for a rock n' roll band.THIS IS ROCK AND ROLL!Highlights: AllLow points: It's only an hour long... Wish it was 3 or 4..."
5,As hard-core as it gets!,"The most successful garage band ever, G N' R introduced their kick-ass sound to the world with their now-classic debut, Appetite for Destruction. Although the artsy side of the band wouldn't emerge until the Use Your Illusion set, the raw talent and energy was apparent from the beginning. Every track on this disc is as hard core as it gets! But you probably already know that, don't you?"
3,A greta band hammpered by a megalomaniac singer,That's it. That's why the band did not survive. Axl destroyed it.
1,Use Your Brains Part 2.......,"I agree with 'use yor brains part 1'(previus reviewer). There is nothing about this album that has an original thought tied to it. Very predictable record. Axl went to the same vocal coach that every other wanna be heavy metal singer went to in the 80's. The man simply can't sing. These guys spent to much time idolizing Keith Richards off stage persona and not enough time paying attention to his playing. All these 80's glam bands did this. They wanted to be rock stars before they learned how to play. It wasn't about music, it was about being famous. Only real talent has staying power. These guys barely got through a second album. They are now listed in the 'Where are they now?' category........the funny thing is though..........nobody is even asking."
1,Foolish,"Never have understood the popularity behind this drug addict band.Seems to me that they were more about the image and Axl's temper tantrums then they were about the actual music. Most of these songs are played on FM rock radio to death, i'm pretty sick of hearing ""Welcome to the Jungle"" for the 100,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 time. It's moron rock at it's worst, no other way to describe this horrendus group's music. People claim them to be the dangeorus ""bad boys"" that brought mean and nasty rock back in the hair-metal era. These people need to have head examinations, this is no different from Poison or Def Leppard, change the make up and spandex for bandanas and ripped jeans. Same processed commercial [...] wrapped up in a different package to be sold to the gullible masses. Guns and Roses is about as freindly, processed and mainstream as you can get, why is it that $h!t bands always make it big while the hard working, talented original ones never get their due?"
1,IT'S NOT GOOD!,"TO COMPARE THEM WITH LED ZEPPELIN IS A JOKE OF BAD TASTE.THEIR PLAYING IS POOR, THE LYRICS ARE AWFUL AND AXL'S VOICE REMINDS ME OF AN AGONISING SEAGULL.PEOPLE WHO WERE TEENAGERS AT THAT TIME TEND TO LET THE HEART SPEAK WHEN TALKING ABOUT THIS SHALLOW MINDED GLAM BAND. THEY WERE JUST LUCKY TO BE ON THE RIGHT PLACE AT THE RIGHT TIME (THE BORING END OF THE 80'S AND BEGINNING OF 90'S).RED HOT CHILLI PEPPERS WERE THERE TOO, BUT AT LEAST THEY CAN REALLY PLAY."
1,Overrated Garbage,Guns N Roses has to be the most overrated band of all time. Welcome to the jungle is the only decent song...But it can't save this album from total Wackness.
1,"poor, drunken, previlaged, forgotten","very sad homophobic LA teenie rock, RIP Axel. About as hard as the spice girls."
3,overated,"there are some good songs on this record, but is overated. axle rose is not a very good singer, but slash makes up for it, with his excellent guitar work. I hate when people make axle out to be one of the great front men, he's not. all in all a decent, but overated album. If you want real hard rock you won't find much here."
3,Not the same as it used to be,"When I first heard this album I was pretty excited, it was a fun listen. The truth is that it really hasn't stood the test of time for me. I really can't listen to it anymore. I would give it less then three stars based on how I feel about it now but that would not be fair, because at one point I had a much higher opinion of the music. Most everybody has heard at least half of the album on the radio, so you should know if you like it or not. This band seems to have somehow attained much more respect then they deserve. This is a cool album at first but it is nowhere near the classic masterpiece that people will insist that it is."
2,THE MOST OVERRATED ALBUM OF ALL TIME,"Ill never figure out why people always rate this album as one of the greatest rock albums ever.When it came out ,Welcome to the jungle was catchy but thats about it. Its very overplayed on rock radio. Axl Rose is a no talent with the most annoying voice in many years. Ill never understand all the hype after all these years, thank god they broke up and Axls new version of GnR was a disaster."
2,What's The Big Deal?,"I agree.Slash is the best guitarist ever,but that's beyond the point.I,along with others,belive that this album is on a low level of lyricism and is full of hair metal ego.Sure,it was a groundbreaking metal album,but it only changed the face of the metal world,where as albums by such artists as Nirvana,Pearl Jam and Green Day helped form modern rock as we know it.Plus,the songs to some people sound the same,using riffs that are to similar to the last.Plus,all the songs are about the same thing:Women or their city.Belive me,women are awesome.But hearing some ugly dude talking about them...not so cool.And people call him the ultimate frontman,which just meant he was an egotistical jerk.So,instead of listening to a one hour and fifteen minute death sentence,go buy Nevermind or Dookie,or Ten(even though i dissed it,it's still better than this).Seriously,this should only be used in execution chambers to murders who have killed many people or anyone else who deserves it."
3,medioacre...at best,"Has some memorable songs...""welcome to the jungle"" ""its so easy"" ""Sweet child o' mine"" But then there are songs like ""Rocket Queen"" and ""Mr. Brownstone"" Axl Rose sux"
2,3 out of 12 tracks,"mr.brownstone is without question one of the BEST rock songs i have ever heard,hands down,welcome to the jungle and its so easy, are the other stand out tracks."
5,Best Glam Rock Record Ever Recorded,"This album is a time capsule of the best glam rock had to offer. Sweet Child Of Mine, Paradise City , & Welcome to the Jungle are 3 tracks that should be in every collection."
5,One of the best albums ever!!,"Appetite for Destruction is clearly one of the best albums ever!It has stood the test of time, and is pure rock and roll."
1,What!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"guns n roses brought back booze drugs and women and killed the corparate hair metal era so many bitching about the profanity, a band with a reputation like G`n`R shood give you an idea of wat wil be on this album and if you dont like it (in the words of axl rose) ""you can suck me"". I will always love this album but what i will never love is censorship, buy the dirty version and get the real G`n`R experience."
2,Great Cover....HORRIBLE SOUND,I was so happy to get this copy of GNR AFD with the original cover. The disc said it was new but when I opened it the disc had scratches on it already. Then I went to play it................SOUNDS TERRIBLE!!! What a depressing pressing. I'd want my money back but I did get this for the cover in all actuality.
5,Oozing with Quality,"Appetite for Destruction may best be known for the hits like Paradice City, Welcome to the Jungle, and Sweet Child O' Mine, but the entire album oozes with the same quality as the three prior.A rarity in ablums these days, every song in Appetite for Destruction is uniquly amazing. in fact, my personal song is not Paradice City or Welcome to the Jungle, but Think About You.There isnt much to say that hasnt already been said, but its unfortunate that such a talented group of guys are no longer willing to make music together again. So if you enjoyed any of the ""hit"" songs in Appetite for Destruction, youll love the entire album."
5,Classic,This is a must have for any rock fan. GNR was a breath of fresh air with this album in the 80s. This is one of the best rock albums of all time with songs from Sweet Child o' Mine to Mr. Brownstone to Welcome to the Jungle. The list of hits form this CD is significant. This is by far the best GNR album.
5,One of the All-Time Greats,"This is the original Guns N' Roses album. It is a legendary, pure rock album, and is generally considered not only their best, but also one of the greatest albums of all time.I have to say I do think it is slightly overrated, due partly to the odd vocals and some of the 1980ish lyrics. Still, in my opinion, most of the songs rate from good to classic. The three most famous tracks---""Welcome to the Jungle,"" ""Paradise City,"" and ""Sweet Child o' Mine""---are still on rock stations somewhat often even today, nearly two decades after their release.If you are a fan of Guns N' Roses or a fan of angry rock music, and you haven't heard this album before, I recommend it."
5,One of the Best Albums Ever,"Plain and simple--this is one of the best rock albums (and debuts) of all time. The rock magazines touted GNR as stars before ""Appetite"" even hit the shelves, even though it took over a year after the album's release for that to become reality. When it did hit, GNR were bigger than anyone could have dreamed, but their incredible first album justified it.The sound was clearly Aerosmith-derived with a slightly punk edge, but it was extremely fresh, brilliantly written, and it seemed the future of rock was in front of us. Axl's aggression was the edge that they needed to put them over the top somehow. Almost every song is a highlight (only filler is arguably ""Anything Goes"") and I can't say enough about this wonderful breakthrough album. Sadly, they never came close to reaching this level of achievement again."
1,BUY THE ORIGANAL,Ok this cd is still gnr but without all the words and riffs it's not nearly as good. Buy the origanal not this. It's much better and cheaper to.
2,I used to love this!,"I have worn out two cassettes, and one vinyl copy of this album. That alone should tell you how much I love it. But even one who loves the album as much as I do should be able to admit to themselves that it's just not very good anymore. In it's initial release, sure, it had power and fury, but it all seems so cartoonish and limp.Take ""Sweet Child O Mine"", a very nice ballad. I had many a party with that as the soundtrack. Listening to it now, the melody is still appealing, but the lyrics are greeting card quality, like bad Paul McCartney. And Axl's singing does the group no favors, either. ""Welcome to the Jungle"" has just become SO overplayed. . .I won't even watch the fifth Dirty HArry movie, which features it prominently.I love Guns and Roses but even I will admit that this album has become nothing but a snapshot of a bygone time. A true ""great"" work of art will still sound vital and fresh many years later."
4,why why why??????,why are people seriously still reviewing this album?it's a great album. now go review something else and leave this one alone. some albums just don't need to be constantly reviewed with 'full track analysis'. some albums are just good. period.
3,The very first band I loved,"I was about 13 when I heard gnr's version of ""ain't it fun"" on the radio back in 1994 (?). I listened to mostly rap music before this. I have to give credit to gnr for showing me the way to great music. First cd's I bought in my life was U2's ""rattle and hum"" and this one. Luckily, my dad bought me in less than a year the rest of gnr's catalogue. Blown away.However, following their advice on the liner notes on ""the spaghetti incident?"", wich was ""go find the originals"" or something like that, I came to realize how much greater music there was that I have never dreamed of before.Ap for destruction is a great rock album for any kid to get sinked into rock and roll. Its a classic album due to the impact the music had on pop culture and its success. But not a rock and roll masterpiece. Not even close.IMO, their best album to get sinked into is the spaghetii, because it might get you to go find the originals."
1,Terrible quality,This record arrived promptly but it skips horribly and is completely unplayable. (This is obviously not a comment on the quality of the album itself -- which is great -- but the product.)
2,Appetite 4 Destruction?,"This album sucks!!! There are some very mean dirty sexy drugsongs on this this is just as bad as Back in Black from ACDC.The only good songs on this would be the 3 big hits featuringWELCOME TO THE JUNGLE, PARADISE CITY, & SWEET CHILD O' MINE.There are only 3 good obscure GNR songs such as IT'S SO EASY,MR. BROWNSTONE, & 14 YEARS from Use Your Illusion 2. Don'tbuy this, buy GNr Greatest Hits insted."
1,Zzzzzzzzzzzz,"This is like Spinal Tap, only Spinal Tap has value because they are funny. The worst, most boring collection of heavy-metal cliches imaginable."
1,this band got silly,"yes i am a hardcore limp bizkit fan. i truly believe this is the reason for the downfall in music today. it was this band who made mtv big, they featured on it thus giving it more airplay. i am a big fan of the bands mtv have but not this is is utter crap. good charlotte, simple plan, sum41, vannilla ice, hilary duff are all talented artists and could be sometimes overlooked because of their unheard of talent. so what im trying to say here is go listen to breakstuff by limpbizkit and youll know what im sayingAIM: yoohooscoobydoo"
1,"ZERO STARS,G'N'R ARE BAD","WOW,WHAT A JOKE,WHO LIKES AWFUL BANDS LIKE G'N'R,GREEN DAY,FOREIGNER AND NIRVANA.APETITE FOR DESTRUCTION IS A MASSIVE JOKE WITH SOME OF THE WORST SONGS IN PARADISE CITY AND WELCOME TO THE JUNGLE.WELL MY FRIENDS DONT BUY ANY ALBUMS FROM THE ABOVE MENTIONED BANDS.BUY ANY ALBUM FROM THE ROLLING STONES INSTEAD."
5,Buy this CD heavy metal fans!!!!!!,"I fist started listening to Guns N' Roses a few months ago and bought their greatest hits cd. It was so good that I needed more GN'R. I bought this album and its excellent! It's awesome heavy metal, but not extremely heavy. I like Axl Rose's Voice and slashes guitar- their awesome! Here's what I rate the songs individually-Welcome to the jungle 5/5It's so easy 5/5Nightrain 5/5Out ta get me 4/5Mr. Brownstone 5/5 Best song on the CD!!Paradise City 5/5My Michelle 5/5Think about you 4/5Sweet Child O' Mine 5/5You're Crazy 5/5Anything Goes 4/5Rocket Queen 4/5The only thing that's bad about this cd is sometimes the language and other offensive lyrics. Otherwise it's the best cd I've heard in a long while. BUY APPETITE FOR DESTRUCTION!"
3,Purchased for nostalgic reasons...,"For any fan of Gnr who wants to realize how old we all have become and truly, how dated this cd sounds. There's songs, I havent heard in awhile and it was cool to hear em again."
2,Guns And Roses Banned cover- Appetite For Destruction,"The impression I was given is that the record was mint condition. to my surprise upon opening the box...the cover had stickers directly on it and a price sticker that someone tried to peel off and ripped the cover under it basically ruining the cover. Upon playing the record I found that there is a major skip on the very first song. The record does sound good other than that, but not mint condition as promised, kind of disappointed that someone has to lie about the condition of these items as well as not showing actual photos of the items instead of the ""stock"" photos that were shown. Especially for for $50.00. I could have bought a cheaper one and gotten better condition. Just a word of caution to all those considering buying a used record of this nature."
5,Album for an era,"G'n R dominated hard rock in the late 80's, and this debut showed that hard rock did not die with Led Zeppelin and the acts from the 60s and 70s. Axl's anger and angst shine through on this record, and they show the hard life that awaits a group from Indiana who moves to LA to make it big. Some classic stuff on this CD, and it shows that sometimes the first effort is really the best."
3,"about a 3.5, but they won't let me give that many stars","If it weren't for a couple of songs that suck, and it had 1 more great song on it, this would be an amazing disk. Paradise City is fabulous, and there are several good songs for example Welcome to the Jungle, Sweet Child of Mine, Mr. Brownstone, and My Michelle. But Other than Paradise City, there aren't any real standouts.And then there are a couple that just suck, especially It's so Easy. They show tremendous talent, and potential that wasn't ever fully achieved, but this isn't quite top notch."
2,"Nasty Cover, Cruddy Pressing","Geffen A&R woman Teresa Ensenat worked hard to ensure that Axl and Co. got the nasty cover art they desired, a painting entitled ""Appetite for Destruction."" You get a copy of the violation and vengeance fantasy art, but the thick vinyl pressing is just horrible. It has no volume, no pop, just a general flatness. That's the real violation here. Take one of the greatest hard rock records of all time and make it a eunuch . . just wrong."
4,Classic Gunners!,"This would have to be the best album the Gunners have brought out.Their other albums are good don't get me wrong,but they just don't have the same raw power and energy as this album.Take the first track for an example 'Welcome To The Jungle' what better way to open a great but with a soild rock track like this one.Then it moves on to kickin' songs such as 'Night Train' and 'Mr Brownstone' and of course the great hit 'Paradise City'.Then comes my personal favorite 'My Michelle' and the classic rock ballad 'Sweet Child Of Mine'.This albums finishes with another great song 'Rocket Queen' (some interesting lyrics in this one).The only bad points I found to this album were 'Anythin Goes' and 'Your Crazy'but overall this album is a must have for any Gunners fan or anyone into good classic rock music."
5,Blast of Fresh Rock (at the time),"GnR was the first post hair metal heavy metal band (even though Axel has good hair) because of their attitude and no-holds-barred music. The songs are great, the guitar playing is ideal -- Slash's virtuosity (well, pentatonic virtuosity) contrasts well with Izzy's sloppy playing. Axel's lyrics feed the fantasies of every suburban teenager, and the drumming is actually pretty sloppy too. Excellent excellent album... must-have for hard-rock fans."
5,Intense,"Definitely among the best albums ever released . The best songs on this are its so easy , nighttrain , mr. brownstone and Out to get me . Very intense . You can feel Rose's desperation .Think about you is rather junk and so also is Anything Goes and You're Crazy . but be assured the rest is breathtaking ."
4,Good Album.,"This is a good album for rock fans. This album released in 1987 features 3 top ten hits ""Welcome To The Jungle"" ""Sweet Child O' Mine"" which hit 1 for 2 weeks and ""Paradise City"". This album stayed on the charts for 147 weeks and sold a whopping 15 million copies. I recommend this album to rock fans but not to people who want something a little less mean. This album is not for children."
3,"This is pretty stupid, kind of immature","The only song I really like on this cd is ""Sweet child of mine,"" which is pretty much a perfect song. Everything else rocks hard (...), though I don't really think that is a good thing. All of the songs celebrate really stupid things, which kill a lot of people and ruin a lot of lives. A glimpse of the Hollywood dream it may be, but when you buy this cd you are paying for Axl's and Slash's extreme bingeing and drug habits. That also goes for The Vines, Elvis Costello, and Marilyn Manson, as well as thousands of other idiot drug users. Don't waste your money just to see the ""Hollywood Dream"" or whatever people talk about this album as being."
3,Yeah! Rock!,This is a great album! It has such classics as Welcome to the Jungle and Sweet Child o' Mine. I don't like Paradise city! Led Zeppelin is much better! Of course the lyrics are not so intelligent but what is better? At least they don't preach!
2,This album is easy to review.,"Just like many other albums (such as the Goo Goo Dolls' ""Dizzy up the Girl"" and Bush's ""Sixteen Stone""), the hits on this album are excellent, Hall-of-fame type material, but all the other songs aren't that great. I would reccomend just burning a CD with Welcome to the Jungle, Paradise City, and Sweet Child O' Mine on it. Those are their three hits, and the only songs worth listening too. Unless you really think that you'll like it, don't bother spending your money on this CD based on the songs you hear on the radio. My Michelle is a decent song, though."
2,best hair metal album,"Appetite for destruction is very good for what it is, which is hair metal, although it is not as good as Def Leppard's Hysteria and Pyromania. These guys learned alot from bands like Ratt and POison, and they are definitely better. This alubm is not their best, tho. Use You Illusion I & II are much better than Appetite because by that time they were better musicians are played a better variety of music. Guns n Roses best songs were written by other people (Live and Let Die, Knockin' on Heaven's Door). The best song they wrote was November Rain but that sounds like Elton John anyway.As far as hairmetal goes, these guys were one of the best, but buy Use You Illusion I and II and Spagetti Incident before buying this album."
2,Appetite for scratchy-ness,"Whenever I hear a Guns n Roses song, I always wonder what Axl does to make his voice sound like that. That dude has that scratchy-est, grittiest, most annoying voice in the history of rock. He sounds like he has a sheet of sand paper caught in his throat. Axl has the kind of voice that totally ruins what could have been a perfectly good song if it were sung by somebody with a listenable voice. GNR has lots of songs (like Paradise City or Welcome to the Jungle for example) that start out great, but turn into total sh.it as soon as Axl opens his mouth. I would have liked this band for their instrumentation, but because the lead singer is a repulsive creep with an annoying voice, I can't stand their music at all!"
5,Best Album Ever,"Appetite For Destruction was the first album I ever got and amazingly it has always been my personal favorite. The entire thing is just plain stunning in its stylistic diversity (for a metal album), its raw energy and feeling and utter perfection throughout. Nothing more to say except that this is one of rock n roll's greatest albums and I recommend it to anyone."
3,"Great music, although it has less intensity than th original","When the editors take out certain words from a song, it takes away from the intensity of the song.The writer put those words in there for a reason.The song still has great music,though with less intensity. If I were you I would buy the un-edited version."
5,Still The Best Rock Album That I Ever Heard,I am really honest that this is the best album of the Guns N' Roses firstly you can find the original members in this album and also all of theirs best performans (even Steven Adler !!) they are telling you something about their lives and hard times I am really not exaggerate that this album deserves the whole stars in our galaxy if you still haven't bought it guees you 've missed so many cool things
5,It doesn't matter anymore (not a Linda Ronstadt reference),"This album is so politically backward. It's very sexist -- GNR Lies is racist and homophobic at times. But ""Appetite"" rocks so hard it doesn't matter what they are talking about. They could personally make fun of my mother. I wouldn't care. Axl's throaty voice and Slash's fast as lightning riffs would still bring a smile to my face. I can't wait for GNR 2000 style!!! We want Axl."
4,Pretty good even if Axel is a jerk...,"The title/summary says it all. The band can/could play, but drugs & alcohol and Axel's self-rightous attitude couldn't hold them together. The albums to follow were half-hearted. If they had made one album out of ""Use Your Illusion I & II"", that would have been cool. Too much filler. My hat is off to this band - they put out some good tunage and probably made a ton of $$$. But to stay together and live off your success you have to have chemistry. These guys definitely did not have it. I'm surprised the band and their crew are still alive. Time for me to milk the cows."
5,Classic,A must buy. I prefer to buy a hard copy of my favorite music and this was really easy to find and buy.
5,ONE OF THE BEST OF ALL TIME!!!!,"WOW!This debut by GUNS N' ROSES is one of the best heavy rock albums of all time, for sure!!!ALL THE SONGS ROCKS REALLY HARD!!!Nighttrain, So Easy, Welcome to the jungle,You're Crazy, Rocket Queen...Man, i gotta say Sweet Child o'mine, the biggest hit here is not the high light here! It's really a great ROCK album...Ask anyone who enjoys heavy rock...THIS ONE, APPETITE FOR DESTRUCTION is one of those moments of heavy rock perfection!!!!"
5,#1 Album of ALL-TIME!,"""Appetite for Destruction"" IS rock. Look up the definition and you'll see the cover beside it. Music today is bland, depressing, and all around boring...I feel for kids growing up having to listen to it. Though my all-time fav song, ""November Rain,"" isn't on this album, this is definitely their best one...there's no ""filler"" on it, every song rocks. This is a classic. Maybe oneday soon Axl will get his head on straight, get Slash back, and DESTROY the rock scene once again...God knows it needs something these days."
5,A Review From A Guns N Roses Fan!,"Guns N Roses kicks a**, and this CD proves it!! ""Paradise City"" gives you a taste of what Guns N Roses is all about!!"
5,"this is the greatest album nothing can compare to it, nothin","when you think about it nothin no nothin can compare to one of the most influencial bands of all time their different yet awsome performance of ripping guitars and pounding vocals of them makes them different and more unique as a great band and this album(one of the best debuting albums ever!!) with the performance of the five musicians(Axl Rose, Slash, Duff McKagan,Izzy Stradlin, and Steven Adler)they came out unstoppable and made this album with some of the best songs ever heard and made you buy it youll see you wont be upset"
5,"Innovative, One of a Kind Sound, Nothing Else Compares","The first time I listened to this album, I thought they had more than one lead vocalist, that's how good Axl Rose is! I have owned it for over ten years now, and I still listen to it more than anything else that I have!"
1,Edited Version?,"It is sad that the ""edited"" version of this cd is still filthy, yes, they are great musicians and have great music; however, why does a band or anyone for that matter feel it is necessary to be profane--for the money? This is why I stopped litening to rock music for fifteen years, and started listening to jazz, (most jazz music does not have words and the musicians have great technical ability like many rock musicians). I will always love rock music, my roots are there; however, I will never accept profanity. Sorry, 5 stars for the music, and zero stars for the profanity."
4,AFD,"This is a good album, but not a great one! The best songs on thisare classics like ""Welcome To The Jungle"", ""Mr. Brownstone"",""Paradise City"", & ""Sweet Child of Mine"". Sometimes I cry afterhearing the song ""Rocket Queen"", it's got a sad melody and sadlyrics. If you need to, pick up my essential album, Love over Gold by Dire Straits. You will never waste money on it like this.Buy this just for the 4 picks."
5,Taking Chance with Kevin Bacon,"The is one of the most moving videos I have ever seen. We are a Marine Corps Family and it is so heartbreaking to go through this. It is the story of a young Marine who gets killed during a firefight with the enemy.Chance is brought to Dover AFB first.It is the step-step journey of the remains of Chance and how he is treated with great care and love.After Chance is bathed and carefully prepared for his viewing, he is then dressed in his dress blues, arranged in his coffin and loaded into the plane. This video is the story of a solemn journey and of the respect shown to him by passengers, motorcycle patriots and more.Chance is greatly loved and I was brought to tears many times.I think this is a ""must see"" video for everyone but especially by those who have never known our military.TEN stars!!"
5,Outstanding...Tear jerker!,A stirring look at the care and dignity given to fallen warriors who are killed while protecting our vanishing freedoms. Every American should have the opportunity to watch this.
5,Kevin Bacon is blessed,"I am from a suburb of Philadelphia and I have never seen anyone do anything more heartfelt for the city that they grew up in than Kevin and his brother. They recently performed a free concert to raise money to support the Mummers to perform on New Year's day 2011. This film does not surprise me, as it suits Kevin, because I know he loves his country as he loves the city of Philadelphia. It is a heartbreaking film, but I now know the respect that is shown to those who have given the utlimate sacrifice for our country. God bless Kevin and his brother. Bob Carroll, Glenside, PA"
4,Movie Review,"Excellent film, but sad. But makes you feel good how our soldiers are treated with such respect in death."
4,Taking Chance,"This DVD arrived on time and in good condition, but UNLABELED. It has a label but it is loose paper and nothing on the DVD or the case identifies it. It looks nothing like the picture that came with it which shows a normal label on the case. Grrrrrr."
3,movie review,"I was pleased with the speed at which I recieved the video, I had no problems with that. The seller did a great job in that department. I did have an issue with the video itself, and I just let it ride because I didnt put a lot of money into the video. The problem occured during the funeral scenes, it stuck and then skipped to the end of the funeral which was almost the end of the movie. I dont know if it was the disc or if it was the dvd player that caused it so I have to let things lie. I was satisfied with the transaction."
3,taking chance,pretty well done. glossed over some of the finer points of the story but a good movie overall.
2,Lacks Dramatic Tension,"Even though I didn't care for this film, I should add that I fully respect those who have served in our armed forces and that I mean no disrespect to them or to their sacrifices. Having said that, this movie impressed me as a flat (but morbid and depressing) semi-documentary with little or no suspense or dramatic value. The cast and the scenery all seemed to emanate from a squeaky clean Norman Rockwell painting--multiracial, cross-generational, photogenic, super-respectful and solemn. Maybe if they had introduced some outside tension--such as romantic temptation or virulent anti-war protestors it would have made for a more compelling movie. On the other hand, I can readily see how the film as produced would appeal to Military families and those who have lost loved ones to combat."
5,A fantastic film from HBO,"This film is so good, so honest, and so simple - that it must have been made behind the backs of the executives and marketing worms in Hollywood. Keven Bacon shows us again why is he is such an accomplished actor. Others have said plenty about why the film is so good - I agree with them and won't reitterate... but this is a must have!"
5,You must see this,"We viewed this movie at a Vietnam Veterans convention. This is one of the best movies that I have ever seen. We had the privilege of meeting Lt Col Stroble at the convention. Even if you are not a military person, this movie will touch your heart and guaranteed to make you shed a few tears. Don't miss this one."
5,A Must See,This is a movie every American should see. Regardless of your views on war It is hard to argue against the humanity of our soldiers.
5,I lived it,"The video very accurately captures the emotions of an escort officer for one of our fallen. I first saw it after I had just returned to Afghanistan from escorting one of my colleagues, who'd been murdered by an Afghan attacker, back home to his family. The tremendous respect that he was shown throughout his journey was closely and clearly mirrored in this movie. Have a kleenex handy."
5,Taking Chance,"This film will both tear your heart apart and fill it with love, pride and honor. It will give you a true sense of what price our service men and women (and by proxy their families and friends) are paying for us to enjoy a free life. If I could afford to buy a copy for every person I know and ask that they take the time to watch it, I would. Chance's story is but one of thousands that could be told. Thank you to the people responsible for making this movie a reality."
5,Perfect,"There are movies that are entertaining, and then there are movies that actually stand for something. This movie, is one of the only movies to come out in recent years that has a purpose. This is one of those rare times where something very sensitve is handle in the same manner, and where something so important, is shown to everyone.Few times in our lives will movies be made that have a purpose to exist. This is one of those rare times."
5,tremendouse,"this is a great movie, for all to watch, I am a veteran and have done escort duty and many funerals, you can only appreciate the honor, respect and difficulty that goes into this service that many ignore!"
5,"Deeply Touching, it portrays the loss of a true hero...","I never knew Chance, one of my husbands friends Did and been a Marine wife my self is hard to put in words all the feelings you go through when your spouse is deployed.I have had the chance to get to chat to Chance's Mom Gretchen a few times, and by talking to her i could see why was he loved so much,, not just for the service he gave to his country but because he was a great man, this story has touched us all so deeply words cant express the sorrow we shared with his family, im pretty sure Chance would be so proud of his family today to know how they have handle his loss, the way they are helping other soldiers deployed is just another example of the meaning this has, today is 5 years since the incident in which we lost Chance, like Lt. Col. Strobl said, I never met Chance but today i deeply miss him."
5,please don.t miss this!,"I showed this to my Family Living classes during the death and dying unit. Teaching concepts of grief and mourning is difficult, but I did not expect to be so moved by a movie such as this. In telling a true story, it's message of dignity and honor was overwhelming...and I wish it were required for everyone to see!"
4,very moving,this was a really great movie. It's a simple story and did have me very emotional at times. Kevin Bacon did a terrific job playing a man trying to return a soldier home.
5,Special delivery,"Short Attention Span Summary (SASS):1. Marine PFC Chance Phelps is an off screen casualty of the war in Iraq2. Lt. Colonel Michael Strobl (Kevin Bacon) takes his remains from Dover Air Force Base in Delaware to his hometown in Wyoming3. If this journey doesn't touch your heart, you probably don't have oneThis HBO movie is a poignant behind-the-scenes look at the unheralded and unsung heroes who process and transport the earthly remains of military personnel who have fallen while on active duty.Kevin Bacon has always been good at military roles, but he positively shines in this one as the Marine Corps representative responsible for returning PFC Phelps to his final resting place.Dignity and respect are the key words here, as the Marine Corps shows the meaning of Semper Fidelis.Amanda Richards, April 23, 2009"
5,Must See,AS a Marine this is a very great film Kevin does an outstanding job! Semper Fi Marines Check it out
5,Great,Sad but informative. I have told so many of my friends to watch this movie. I learned so much about how our Heroes are treated.
5,Accurate protrayal of the dignity and respect American shows for its fallen heroes.,"Having just visited Dover Air Force Base and observing the magnificient manner in which every casualty is received and the flawless dignified and respectful care shown the remains, property and families of the fallen, I found the movie to convey that story well. Of all nations on earth, America values individuals and freedom. When one of its own citizens pays the ultimate sacrifice in service to the country, the nation responds by doing its utmost to honor the service member and all their family. The movie makes me proud to be an American."
5,Touched,The fact that my son is a Marine had something to do with my response to this film. However it is a masterpiece and will be remembered that fallen soldiers will not be forgotten. It also reflects the country's reactions to a soldier returning to the US for buriel and the dedication and honor that is bestowed upon him by the officer accompanying him to his final destination. MUST SEE
5,reccomend for all marines,I bought this film mainly because we don't have HBO and I wanted to see it. It's an incredible movie and will make you cry. It also shows that one of a kind characteristic of a marine. Kevin Bacon gave an incredible performance like always. This is a great movieChloe Diaz
5,This is a gripping Heartfelt Movie,This is a must see. Kevin Bacon really plays the role well. It will pull at your heart strings. I think every family should see this movie. weather your for or against the war really don't matter it is a matter of supporting our troops and their families. I did this job once and trust me it is right on the money.
4,Taking Chance powerful video,"One of the best movies to help appreciate what our serviceman sacrifice to keep us safe. Except for the obligatory jab at George Bush, this was a real life look at the heart of America and the passion for our values which is many times lost to the Inside the Beltway crowd."
5,Proud to be an American,"Our family loves this movie. It makes me so so proud to be an American. Believe it or not, watching this movie made it easier to send our son off to Marine boot camp."
5,An American Hero Comes Home,Being the widow of a dedicated Army and Reserve veteran whan I received this video I watched it eagerly. I was not however prepared for the power of this video. I have felt compelled to watch it over and over again. It is truely moving and I would recommend everyone see it. American doesn't know what military families endure.
5,Taking Chance,Every American should see this movie out of respect for our military and civilians who have fallen to protect us. EXCELLENT movie!
5,Outstanding!!!,"this movie is recommended for all. Everytime the LTC gave a silent salute, i tear came to my eye. This movie should def be on your list to buy. it gives an accurate portrayal."
4,An effective lesson,"Thoughful presentation of the treatment of a deceased Marine. It was especially poignant because my son is serving in the 82nd Airborne 1/504 PIR in Afghanistan. The movie gave perspective on the respect that others have for those who serve. Nicely done, effective without pulling levers."
4,Excellent,This is a movie every American should see. The courage and sacrificeof our Armed Forces is truly amazing. This is a side of the equation thatwe rarely get to see. It elevated my respect for these guys.
5,An eye opener,"This is a very moving story based on a true incident. It will grab your attention and make you think. The story really brings home the costs of wars, declared or not, and should make one question every time we send our brothers and sons in harm's way."
5,Taking Chance,"If you have served, are related to someone that has served, or just know someone that has served in the military this movie is for you.It is the story of the journey home for an American marine killed in Iraq, and the escort that is responsible for seeing him home during the last leg of that journey.So often today the entertainment industry focuses on the titillating, meaningless drivel of what is known as ""reality TV"". This movie is snapshot of the price some pay so the rest of us can continue to enjoy the fruits of living in this great country of ours. Everyone should take the time to sit down and watch this so they can better understand that living in a fee society isn't free. Real people pay the ultimate price every day. They deserve our respect, and our gratitude."
5,American Respect,"I saw this HBO movie earlier this year and wasn't aware until after Veteran's Day that it was available for purchase. I teach 7th grade Geography and wished I'd had it the week of Veteran's Day but showed it to nearly 100 students the week before Christmas break and was amazed at their reactions. It is not a ""feel good"" movie but I think it's important that all Americans are aware of the sacrifice given by these young men and women who fight for our country as well as the ultimate sacrifice that their families are faced with. Several of my kids told of approaching service people in uniform and thanking them for their service and what a wonderful reaction they were given. I recommend Taking Chance to all ages."
1,bad...BAD...BADDD!,Absolutely horrible! Not even adequate for practicing dance steps. Much better music can be found for $5-10 at any music store. Better to spend your money for beer or cigarettes...they're better for you than this CD
1,There's better choices out there,"While this CD does offer a wide variety of dances all in one place, I don't care for the quality of music. I teach ballroom dancing and have competed in the past, and I find the music largely uninteresting at best and annoying (ie, Susan's vocals could use some work and the tempo tends to wander at times) at worst. Some of the male vocals are excellent (Roger), but sparse. There are much better dance cd's out there for similar prices."
3,Lots of music of reasonable quality,The CD contains a good variety of dance music with lots of tunes. The vocals are average in quality and the musical arrangement is reasonable but not great. I would rate it as average quality.
4,"Thorough, Pragmatic [few flaws]","Most English words, from the common [eg.""of""=multiple listings] to technical, medical/scientific and some needing an unabridged ENGLISH dictionary are included, generally justifying the 'Comprehensive' in the title. Colloquialisms and neologisms are noted. The biggest lack I find is when there is room for a notation which would help the user categorize an obscure word [with sci/med/mil etc.] and that is not done. Overall, this is an eminently worthwhile book for anyone intersted in Esperanto!"
2,Poor quality,"I bought this to review the quality compared to much more expensive and name branded grids. You get what you pay for on this. Flimsy grids, cheap Velcro and easily rips."
3,Bargain for the money,"I bought the International flatware set to have on hand as ""extras"" for entertaining and large family dinners. It is 18/0 stainless, so if you're expecting Lenox or Yamazaki quality, then you will be surely disappointed. The pieces are light weight, but sturdy for everyday use. The serving pieces are a nice bonus as well as the steak knives. For $30, the set is a bargain."
4,"Awesome durability, even through foul weather.","After reading a blog entry reviewing several bike locks, I was convinced that this OnGuard Bulldog u-lock was the one for me during my college days in the Midwest. Through several seasons now, the lock has proved its durability and the extra keys have been really handy. (Just don't rely on that keylight!) My only concern would be about the lock's performance in freezing wet weather. A few times, water snuck into the locking mechanism and froze into an annoying problem. Granted, I didn't keep my bike in covered storage, and the ice wasn't anything my grip and twisting strength couldn't overcome with a minute of diligence. I like this lock and I think it got the job done well."
3,"Good, except for the mounting bracket","The lock seems fine and functions well, but the mounting bracket isn't working right. It has a yellow latch that you slide a groove on the lock into to mount it to the bracket, and it is supposed to keep the lock from sliding out again. The yellow latch also has a thumb piece that you can push on to release the lock. But I can pull the lock straight out without even pushing the thumb piece, this would probably be a major pain if you're riding over bumpy roads and the lock decides to slide out and onto the ground. I'm hoping that this is a just a problem with my lock and not every lock of this model."
3,"Probably Won't Get Broken, Lock Different Than Picture","I'm happy with this lock - the keys are good, especially because they have a very thin profile in the plastic casing, meaning they don't take up unnecessary space. However, the lock itself does not look like the picture on this profile -- if you google ""OnGuard DT 5012"", that's what it looks like. One other disappointment is that it was not long enough to lock my front wheel and the frame to a pole or a bike station. I'll have to get another lock to do that. On the plus side, it's pretty tough."
3,"Good lock, terrible bracket","This lock has been great -- no problems at all. The bracket, on the other hand, is flimsy and terribly made. The piece that attaches to your frame is made of fabric (really? fabric?), and the tightening bolt that is meant to hold it in place lasted for about a week. If you have space in your backpack, buy the lock. If not, find one with a bracket that actually works so that it can attach to your frame."
4,great u-lock for any bike,"Got this lock for my old-school Schwinn road bike in LA. It's surprisingly lightweight, yet certainly large enough to lock around any pole & thick enough to deter thieves. I've never lost a key but it's good to know I have several extras on hand just in case."
3,Decent Lock,"As they say , ""You get what you pay for"". At $25 this is a decent lock that I would use to secure an inexpensive bike. But wouldn't feel confident that this puppy could protect a quality bike from well-healed criminals."
4,Oridinary stuff with a couple of great songs.,"I'll be honest. I have absolutely no interest in this kind of music and I only bought the CD coz it has the song 'Betcha Never' from the animated movie Batman: Mystery of the Batwoman. It's a very cool song indeed and since a soundtrack CD of said movie is not available I ended up getting this for that one song only.Most of Cherie's songs on this CD are the typically cliched songs any female singer does. All about falling in love, breaking up, being scornful towards past lovers, longing for past lovers, etc. A couple of them are good, such as 'Older Than My Years', which is a great example of Cherie's powerful voice and singing talent. 'Body, Soul and Heart' is also quite good but 'Betcha Never' has the best melody and feeling to it.A quicktime video of 'I'm Ready' is included on the CD."
4,Hitcooper.com Review,"If you like super cheesy pop and amazing female vocals, then definitely check out this album... It's composed of powerful ballads as well as a few upbeat pop songs that are really quite catchy... Everyone is touting her as the 'new millenium Celine Dion'... something I do not disagree with... And I must mention she was chosen by Hitcooper.com as a featured artist... A definite sign she's worth checking out..."
4,Great voice,"Cherie has a great voice. The tunes are basic pop music. It's fun, but nothing I'll listen to every week. But, I cannot say enough about her voice."
4,Total Pop Ear Candy,"OK...I picked this album up because it looked kind of interesting. Now, let me say that my musical tastes run the gamut (from Abba to ZZ Top). This album kind of surprised me. I didn't realize that I had previously heard many of the songs on television. I love, love, love ""I'm Ready"" - what a great song - extremely catchy. This album kind of reminds me a of a young Celine Dion with a shades of Christina Aguilera's first album mixed in. Cherie can definitely sing. Most of the songs are throw-away pop schmaltz but it is a fun listen. It'll be interesting to see how she develops over time."
4,Good General Background to the Artist and His Work,"This was the catalogue of an exhibition put together by the Tate, the Musee d'Orsay and the National Gallery of Art Washington, which toured the three galleries in 1995. It doesn't claim to be a full catalogue of Whistler's work, but is a good cross-section and provides ready access to information about the artist, his times and relevant influences, along with a good sample of his output. The printing is done on good quality filled paper and the book provides faithful reproductions of the works illustrated."
2,Way disappointed !,The only thing I hate about this warmer that it's tooooo small. however it warms wax pretty good.
1,Poor info,I had to send planters back which cost big bucks because the description didn't tell me they fit a 6 inch railing instead of a 4 inch railing.
5,Good Railing Planter,I have three of these planters. The first has lasted through several Indiana winters and I expect the new ones to last for years to come.
5,Deck Planters,I bought 3 of the Apollo deck planters - 12 x 24 and love them! They are sturdy andlook beautiful on my deck. I wish they were just a bit deeper but next year I'll take that into cosideration when deciding what to plant. I would highly recommend them.
4,"Somewhat outdated, but still worth while","McNeill calls American Indians and Africans little more than the victims of the West in this book. He explains that they have little role in the development of culture (which he sees as passing from society to society from Mesopotamia on, like some sort of conceptual Olympic torch) and some get it and others do not. It is an outdated and bigoted way to see cultural history, and difficult to read without cringing.That said, the book contains marvelous elements. Few writers will explain with his brevity and mastery how cultures have passed elements, one to another, over the expanse of time; few writers can convey the forward momentum of history as McNeil. So with all its faults, it is very worthy book, certainly worth reading while keeping in minds its somewhat dramatic shortcomings."
2,nothing groundbreaking here..,"Read ""THE DECLINE OF THE WEST"" instead if you're interested in a deeper perspective of world-history.The Eurocentrism of this book is old hat."
5,If you liked Tragic Kingodm you'll LOVE this,"The Beacon Street Collection was released just before Tragic Kingdom, and it contains many songs that were produced prior to their ""evolution"" on Tragic Kingdom. Nonetheless, this album has some of the BEST No Doubt songs including ""Total Hate"", ""Doghouse"", ""By the Way"", ""Greener Pastures"", and the rock masterpiece ""Open the Gate"". Like all of No Doubt's album, this is a MUST HAVE if you like No Doubt or just rock/ska music!"
5,"Something to ""squeal"" about","The music on the cd is really great and all of the songs grow on you after you've started listening. This is Gwen's younger and more energetic voice, so it's a change from the other No Doubt songs, but all of these tunes are different and interesting in their own way. Some of the best songs on the cd are: Open The Gate, Greener Pastures, Total Hate 95', and Squeal. You'll really love this album."
4,Great album,"Wow...what a great album. Keep in mind, while reading this review, that i am a big No Doubt fan and am a little bit biased...so there ya go. This album is a really good way to define the way No Doubt evolved from their ska roots to define their distinct sound in Tragic Kingdom. Open the Gate is a great fast-paced opener. Total Hate '95 is great for it's mix of two differnt sounds of two different bands: No Doubt and Sublime. Stricken is a great live song...STRONG LYRICS! By the Way, That's Just Me, and Snakes are really great songs as well. Along with Squeal and Doghouse; the album's closer. Overall, The Beacon Street Collection is a fun and lively album that gives a punch of a plethora of different emotions"
4,This one might be an aquired taste.,"I love all of No Doubt's CDs, so when I bought this one, I was a little surprised. I didn't really like it at first. So I listened to it a few more times before I finally realized how great it really was. And then I wondered how I could have ever disliked this one of a kind gem. So if you listened to this CD, and you didn't like it, give it a second chance. It might surprise you.If you liked this, I recommend: Try other No Doubt albums, and the ska band Save Ferris."
4,"No doubt about it, this is No doubt","I bought this cd recently becoming their biggst fan after buying the singles one. (It was awesomE!)aNYWAY, I heard that this was totally different, at the time all the reviews said ska music, i didnt no what it meant but they were right, ska music is like punk with insturments such as the trombone and saxophone, etc.Well, anyway, this was a great album, maybe because eric stefani was still in it. I dont no but I liked Open the gate up,and blue in the face. If you like No ndoubt already and are undecided, get this, its a different no doubt. If you like ska music and never heard no doubt definetly get this! It is so good but not as good as other albums such as their singles one!!"
5,Buy it now.,"This CD is better than No Doubt's first, but nothing can be compared to Tragic Kingdom. All the songs on this album are worth the money."
3,Tolerable,"'The Beacon Street Collection' was kind of like a practice run before 'Tragic Kingdom' was recorded. Some of the songs are annoying, and others are perfect. 'Open the Gate' is just perfect, definately the best song on the CD. 'Blue in the Face' is annoying, especially with Gwen's buzzing noise she does in the middle of the song (what the f-ck is that?). 'Total Hate' teeters in between really good and really horrible. 'Stricken' is decent and so is 'Greener Pastures'. The rest of the album is somewhat boring and forgettable, except for 'Squeal' another song I absolutely love. 'Doghouse' is truly horrible and embarrassing. 'The Beacon Street Collection' is a mixed bag of tunes, but sadly it is no Tragic Kingdom part II."
5,The last of the true No Doubt!,"This is No Doubt at their very finest and at the same time also the last commercial album release on which they were true to themselves. Any album after the ""Beacon Street Collection"" was pop, so this is as good as it gets.The whole album is one giant pool of ear candy as No Doubt pull all the stops and demonstrate what they've really got in them. No frills, no pretending, just a bunch of straight, honest and very creative tunes. If you thought Tragic Kingdom was good, this one will blow your mind!"
5,"i love no doubt and all their records, they are great","i was at one of their conserts and it was great, it was the most wonderful thing"
3,Beacon Street Collection,1. Open the Gate 5/52. Blue in the Face 3/53. Total Hate '95 4/54. Stricken 3/55. Greener Pastures 2/56. By the Way 3/57. Snakes 1/58. That's Just Me 2/59. Squeal 4/510. Doghouse 2/5
2,umm....,"I love Gwen Stefani and No Doubt, adn I figured, to tide me over until the Sweet Escape, I'd get one of ND's older CDs since I have all of them Tragic Kingdom and on. It was between their debut and this. since Beacon Street got rave reviews, i bought it over the self-titled one.. When i popped it into my stereo, it was only alright. Some tracks were ok, but some made me feel nauseated and I could only listen to it for the first 5 seconds. *cough* blue in the face *cough* The only songs that I liked were By The Way and Doghouse was ok. I lovvveee by the way though. Overall its worth two stars for me. [I love the inside of the disc all the pics are so cool. I also like the disc with all the little band members!]AC"
2,Utter rubbish,"I myself did not buy this album. It was a birthday present from a mate. I don't know what gave 'mate' the idea I liked ska but never mind. I thought I would like this album as I put it on and heard Gwen Stefani and the rest of No Doubt beating out the first song. Sadly, none of the other tracks live up to 'Open The Gate'. 'Utter Hate '95' is one of the worst songs I've ever heard. This got so boring, but as there were only 10 tracks it was not much to worry about. I only gave this two stars because1) 'Open The Gate'2) It is No Doubt. No Doubt are a GOOD band, don't let this album put you off."
3,Barclay bridge cards,The cards are great...I just don't like the design of them or the colors. They are boring in design and the colors don't go with anyone's house decor.
5,The one book to have for the rookie on safari,"My wife and I went on our first safari to Northern Tanzania National Parks with a very experienced leader (over 100 safaries). He recommended this book and that we keep a journal--something I have not done in 35 years. HE WAS RIGHT! We carried this book with us on every game drive and refered to it often. At camp we entered journal entries. These proved very valuable after our return to organize and present video and photos. This book has almost everything you want to look up. In addition the packing checklists were 100% right on for our experience.If you take only one book on safari, I strongly recommend this one. If you can take more, I recommend Estes's Safari Companion and a good field guide with color pictures like the Audubon."
5,Great guide!,I took my family on safari in South Africa and we all had a copy of this wonderful guide. It was a very helpful tool for planning and for gleaning information on what we were seeing.
1,Unfortunately worthless,"This book is full of not-enough information to bring on a trip and therefore has precious little extra room for you to do your own writing. The maps are such poor quality that you'll undoubtedly have a better one, and all the extra information is just not worth the weight. Better to bring a blank book along with a good map or guide book. Could be very good for kids if parents are already informed."
2,LESS THAN I EXPECTED,"THE BOOK WAS VERY SHORT AND DID NOT EXPAND VERY MUCH IN A LOT OF IMPORTANT AREA'S...THIS COULD OF ALMOST BEEN A START UP BOOK FOR ANY TYPE OF SMALL SERVICE BUSINESS. I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED IN THE FACT THAT SEVERAL OF THE ORGANIZATIONS LISTED WERE EITHER NO LONGER FUNCTIONING OR NEVER DID. THE CONTACT NUMBERS AND WEB ADDRESSES ARE ALL DEAD ENDS. THE BOOK DID HOWEVER HAVE GOOD POINTS ON OUTLINING THE START OF YOUR BUSINESS (HOWEVER GEARED FOR SOMEONE WITH A LOT OF MONEY TO START). I ALSO THINK THE BOOK BARELY TOUCHED UPON THE AREA'S OF HOW TO ATTAIN LICENSE'S AND PERMIT'S. OVERALL I WAS DISAPPOINTED BUT IT WAS NOT A TOTAL LOSS, I LEARNED A FEW THINGS THAT I WILL PROBABLY USE IN THE START UP OF MY BUSINESS."
4,Excellent and mandatory reference,I require this book for the character animation course I teach. The emphasis on realistic drawing and proportions with the anatomical structure information make this a very good book but it is beginning to show its age (photos). A revision of this text would be warmly received.
3,3 stars. I'm not sure,"When i looked at this book, i thought it was cool and it could teach me a lots of things. But when i received it, i notice its kinda for advanced students. I'm a beginner and trying to study the anatomy of the body. I'm not sure if its good or bad, but if you are a advanced student you should know it. I'm still keeping it."
1,Wrong on many fronts,"For a book about strategy and strategic decision making this book has many flaws. I will point out three strikes:1. Cost allocation: Since when does fixed allocation part of decision making? In the context of discussing Mercedes and other luxury car makers the author laments how drop in sales resulted in higher cost allocation. They go on to use this example to say why differentiation never pays.2. Focusing on % margin: Instead of focusing on absolute profits the book focus on % margins. For instance they say how in 1985 K-Mart has better % Gross margin than Wal-Mart. But what about the absolute gross margin numbers? Who is the leader 25 years later?3. Talking with absolute certainty: The book talks in certainties and does not consider the possibility that some of the predictions or analysis could be wrong. For example, saying Apple got it all wrong vs. Microsoft.Follow me on twitter: @pricingright"
4,Straight forward - solid overview,"Places Porters 5 competive forces in proper context. Good overview, to the point, and a quick read. Chapter on valuation - NPV shortcomings is also good."
4,review,"This book is great, detailed qualitative analysis regarding case studies of today's large organizations. This book sheds light on the authors Value Investing book (released later) relating special attention to his theories on quantitative analysis based on Columbia Business School theories. This is like a George Harrison album adding the Graham and Buffet books being the full on Beatle collection."
5,Suprisingly good,"I am not usually a fan of time-travel romances, but this one was good. I really liked the main characters. Magnus is a viking who has a number of children and a heart of gold. He is transported through time with his children to modern day California. Not only is it funny to see a grown main adjust to a new time, but adding all those children into the mix really added to the humor in the story. The only thing that really did not add up was how long it took for all of them to realize they were in another time. For the longest time, Magnus and his children thought ways were different becaue they were in a new land, not time. I thought that made them seem dumb. Other than that, it is sexy, warm, and funny. Very entertaining, even if time-travel is not your usual genre of romance."
5,"Fantastic Time Travel book. If you like Viking stories, this is the one.","I loved this book, this book will make you laugh. Things we take for granted and know about, reading the hero's tries at trying to fit into the year of 2000, was comical.Sandra Hill's books are so funny. I love her writing. You will not be disappointed in the book.There was a part in the book, where he went to the pawn shop to sell his coins. His coins was antiques and in mint condition. He thought he had gotten cheated, because the pawn shop owner paid him in a check and cash. He had never seen paper money.And wait till he discovers about birth control.LOL That is FUNNY!!!!!!!!!"
1,Utterly Abyssmal,"One of the worst books that I have ever read, this novel is poorly written and contains some of the creepiest, though boring and unsexy, sex scenes that I have ever read. The puns are lame and the characterizations shallow. Bad, bad, bad. Save your money, save your time, and save your IQ by steering clear of this steaming pile. I'll give it one star since it did not spontaneously combust and burn my house down."
4,this was my first time reading this author,I have ordered all the other viking books. That has to say somthing. Funny!!
1,Don't bother,With the tons of Photoshop books out there is one should be at the bottom of the list or not on the list at all. Being a veteran photoshop user and having bought quite a few PS books in the past this one is the worst I've come across. I bought this thinking it would cover information for using PS for video that other books hadn't covered. Not only was the information in this book incredibly basic it was also very hard to read.
5,Beautiful people in a beautiful book,"When I first saw this book the first thing that came into my mind was that I need it badly. I was simply astonished by the amazing pictures Leni Riefenstahl composed. If someone wants to see the beginning of our civilization and feel it up, close and personal, then this book is a must. Other than having a picture about how man survives in harmony with Mother Nature, one can see how beautiful the human body is in itself."
2,Don't Bother with this,"I am just recently venturing into the world of digital music and MP3 players. Being technology-ignorant, I wanted simple but comprehensive instructions on how I could upload my CD music library onto my new MP3 player and on how to create playlists. But all the information I found--online, in magazines, books--was geared specifically to IPods (a brand I had decided against as too expensive). After extensive searching, I finally found this book & hoped it would help. Unfortunately, the book was worthless to me. Despite being a ""For Dummies"" style book, some parts were incomprehensible or unnecessarily complicated. The rest of the information was hopelessly outdated. For others searching for similar help, keep searching--don't bother with this book."
5,Great Item,"This Bialetti Espresso maker is perfect. I've tried the newer fancy machines and they have been just terrible. Sometimes, going ""back to basics"" is exactly what you need and this fits the bill. The Italians perfected the art of brewing great espresso years and years ago and this is how they do it! Simple, clean design and easy to make. Don't hesitate!!!"
4,Fan of Bruce Willis,I am a big fan of Bruce Willis which made these DVDs a good choice for me. Last man standing was pretty violent but well acted.
3,love Bruce,Its fun to enjoy the excitement. His work is always a great effort and I do appreciate the shows hes in.
4,"Blu-Ray 2 movie pack - When on sale, makes for a good deal.","After spending a lot of $$$ on DVD's, and then picking the loser in the HD/Blu-Ray battle, I've haven't been anxious to run out and replace or add to our collection with Blu-Rays. Speed forward a few years and pricing comes down, deals are better, and only having 1 of the movies on DVD, for $9.99 it made sense to buy this two movie pack. For the most part, we're not into a bunch of ""Extra"" features - just the movies. Quality was fine, and the price was right.FYI - There are several 3-movie packs floating around that sometimes drop pretty darn low. Keep your eyes out for those as well."
4,Old faves on Blu,"Not such a big fan of Boy Scout, but I love Last Man. I saw it in the theater and loved it. It wasn't much of a hit with mainstream audiences, but it's still a great Bruce Willis film. If you like westerns/gangster films, you'll enjoy it. Light on the extras, but the price justifies that."
3,Vintage Willis,"Just the thing to watch on a rainy Saturday night when you have nothing else to do. Anyway, the price was right."
3,Two movies? No thanks,"Most of the time, people buys DVD or Bluray to own film.Otherwise they only download the film and watch or rent them.I made a bad choice. I should have bought The Last boyscout only.Two movie in one disc reduced the quality owning it."
5,Sister Act 2 Pack,I gave this 2 pack of Sister Act and Sister Act 2 as a gift and my friend absolutely loved it. It was a very good prie for both movies. I love this movie too and wish they would release a DVD with some kind of extras but this is a good package to have if you like these movies.
5,funny!,"whoopi can do just about any type of role from dramatic to comedy. whoopi plays such a great nun and show girl, she makes it beveable. the price for the two movies is great compared to buying the movies separately. when i need a good laugh i just put these movies in and watch whoopi do her thing. whoopi give the choir in the first movie and the lauryn hill character in the second movie the ablilty to show there sing voices."
5,I love it!,"These movies are hysterical, even if you do not like old school movies. There is spunk and drama and comedy all in one. I am not a huge Whoopi Goldburg fan, but she got my attention with these movies and I enjoy watching them!!"
2,Movies were scratched,Movies came scratched and while viewing it would skip around and pause at random moments. Real disappointment :( However the scenes we were able to watch were very funny and they were great movies. Overall it would just be nice if the movies were viewed before they were sold to check for quality.
3,You can save on the twinpack,"A tip - only buy the first one, one of the funniest original films of the decade. The sequel is cliched, miserable pap."
4,sister act / sister act2 -back in the habit,i feel that this movie was very good. ihave watched this movie many timeson tv and decided to buy it
2,Nice on 1 disc - but NO remastering/higher quality,"It is convenient I suppose to have these two films on one disc. But there is absolutely no remastering of the films for better quality. They are noticeably poor quality transfers that look almost worse than the DVD. I don't think any of the extras are new, so unless you don't have the DVDs...save your money!"
5,gift,I purchased this as a gift. I haven't heard any complaints from the family member I bought it for. They seem happy.
3,worth what it cost,"Both of the movies are there and it was about what I expected. Nothing more, but nothing less. I thought there would be a little more special features but I guess you can't just create those..."
5,Love these movies,"I have seen both these movies before and had purchased them on VHS. This was before DVD's and in several moves, I lost them. I was extremely happy to find them here on the double DVD and have now settled back to enjoy my two favorite films.This is the first time I've seen them as a double pack and appreciate that fact. It saved me time and money looking for 2 seperate dvds."
4,Heavenly,"Whoopi was outstanding in both movie, Kathy and Maggie played their roles very well. The young ones in two were exceptional. Their singing in both were very good. The children sang beautiful."
5,"Simply ""The Bible"" for Mexican folk art lovers","Beautiful pictures, informed text! Collectors use this ""Bible"" as a reference to describe their Mexican folk art.Most of the information is unavailable in other books.Plus, the book is gorgeous."
2,Think before you buy this expensive import,"Anyone who loves Emmit Rhodes'work on his self-titled album and with his great early band the Merry-Go-Round should beware of shelling out the big bucks for this baby. ""Daisy Fresh From Hawthorne"" and ""American Dream"" have all the solo Rhodes you really need. Rhodes himself has complained that ""Paradise"" was written and recorded hastily and disconsolately. You may say to your self, that it is not possible that the genius who did those earlier albums could do anything all THAT bad, but take my word for it -- ""Farewell to Paradise"" should never have been resuscitated."
4,good album from the icepick...,"Some really good songs on this one and great production/sound. Not quite as solid as ""Two sides to every story"" or ""Do not disturb"" (which are both solid from start to finish) but still worth picking it up."
5,An Up N' Comer!,"Production values are good for this album. The mixture of music (from old school rock driven tunes like the title track to the gentle ballad of ""Forever"") show that Pam has a good solid range. A little fine-tuning of the material, and she's well on her way to a solid career! A must-have for the new country fan!"
4,"Wonderful, much-needed expose-type work","This is an eye-opening book because I believe it may describe (though to a more extreme extent than is typical), the experiences of many a young Christian that got sucked into this word-faith / river/ apostolic movement and its wacky beliefs and practices. Most sobering is the psychological and emotional grip that is used to control and delude, and the fact that many of the culprits are very much deluded themselves. A timely warning for each Christian to be a Berean and to be aware of many off-road but powerful doctrines in the air today."
3,Arctic Daughter,"I was quite happy with this bookand It was weote in great detail,i understand a lot more about the Arctic and how a person needs to know to survive it it.the service i receaved when ordering it,would recommed i,t to everyone."
1,brown - yellow roses,What a rip-off!!!! $80 for roses that arrived with brown edgeslooked terrible...lasted 2 daysi'll use 1-800 flowers next time
2,The ending in the first chapter?,"We read this book for our book club and although we knew a little about the story, many of us did not know the details of the murders and we were greatly disappointed that the ending was summarized in the first chapter. This story has all the makings for a great novel from adoption, wealth, forensic evidence etc so I would like to challenge someone to rewrite it making it a more enjoyable read. Not one of our book club members finished the book!"
2,"Undisclosed that these are re-recordings, grrrrrrr!","It would have been nice if it said ""New Stereo Recordings"" or ""New versions"". The fact that there are remixes does not mean that the material was re-recorded, take ""Motown Remixed"" for instance, none of the songs in that collection were re-recorded by the artists, they were simply remixed... well remodeled. Nonetheless it was the originally recorded versions that were remodeled, not re-recorded versions.For this album, the songs were all re-recorded and select songs were remixed. Some of the re-recorded songs sound alright but nothing compares to the original recordings that I grew up with. It would be nice if the original recordings could get some remix treatment. As for the remixes on this album, they are ok, but some sound generic, like they were remixed just for the sake of remixing being so commonplace these days.Do not pick this up if you are looking for the original recordings of these great songs."
2,Not What I Expected,"I was so excited to receive this CD when I ordered it following the death of Mr. Pendergrass. Unfortunately, although the songs are correct, not one of them sounds like the originals. Other friends agreed. The CD lacks base undertones, maybe even the vocals are not the same. There are parts where Mr. Pendergrass sung lacking the power and even some of the ad-libs. I know the songs very, very well. Sounds more like the songs were redone by Mr. Pendergrass following his years of being incapacitated. I also purchased ""Harold Melvin and the Bluenotes featuring Teddy Pendergrass"" within a day or so of this one. All of the Bluenote CD sounded exactly as remembered. Just don't know what happened to the TP product."
4,"Outstanding buy, but one strange problem...","I trimmed the mat to fit my smaller pan, and it is really affected by heat, expanding so much my cookies were riding on moguls. Other than that, I love the set! I'm buying more for gifts tonight!"
5,Hubby loves to bake...,"He's wanted some of these for such a long time! This was a phenomenal deal for this many items. What a bargain! They are not small, if you're worried about that. They are all standard sized bake ware. Now my father in law wants some!"
1,Just say no!,"I got these about a year ago. I tried using them several times after buying them, only to frustrate myself. Every time this bakeware is used, the smoke detector goes off about a million times.. and I'm not burning anything! Not to mention these things are so flimsy, it's hard to get things out of the oven without them spilling. Food DOES stick to the silicone as well if not sprayed. I only use this bakeware when I absolutely have to-- when my others are dirty."
1,Horrid book,"I'm just completing an undergraduate course using this book and I've found it to be totally useless. The examples are bad or do not completely illustrate the concept he is trying to show. There are many errors in the book, especially in translating a physical system into a simulation model. The model just doesn't fit the actual system and will be misleading if you actually try to apply it.I generally keep my textbooks but I've given serious consideration to selling this one back to the bookstore. The only thing that stops me is that I don't want to be responsible for some poor sap who buys this thinking they have gotten a good deal. If I had a fireplace, the book would have more value as fuel.Don't buy this book!"
5,hard to believe,"I have the LP and I also bought the CD of this concert. It is great fun to listen to this band. The part that is hard to believe is that Three Dog Night was the warm up act for Steppenwolf this night. To me ""Chest Fever"" is my favorite song of the show which features the whole band and shows how good Three Dog night really was. By the way Three Dog Night made alot of great LP's with with alot of hits and very little filler."
1,WARNING: Sound quality is terrible,"I am a longtime fan of this band and love their great choice of songs, harmonies and the band. I always wanted to own this album as a kid, but never got a chance until I recently refound it here. What a disappointment. The recording is terrible. It sounds like a bad bootleg. There are no liner notes, only a warning on the sleave that the sound quality is terrible. I wish I knew this before I bought it. Do not waste your money on this disc!"
5,Wish I'd Been There!,"This is my favorite live album of all time; bought it in early 1970, shortly after it came out. I'm so glad the CD version is available now, because I've absolutely worn the vinyl out! As someone else mentioned, it is a little short, but the energy is fabulous. The versions of It's For You, Nobody, One, ""Eli's-a-Comin"" , and Try a Little Tenderness are, IMO, much, much better than the studio cuts. Both vocals and instrumentals seem to be a lot more together in this live album. Unbelievable that it was done in '69, seems like only yesterday!"
5,"Three Dog Night in their ""heavy"" (not heavy metal) period","My brother bought this album in about 1971 and it is one of my all-time favorite live albums. The band is tight and funky. Cory, Chuck, and Danny are incredible vocalists no matter which one is singing lead. The harmonies are great, but my favorite parts of the album are when they do their best Sam and Dave/soul/r&b/gospel-influenced ad-libs on the outros of songs like ""Feelin' Alright"" and ""Nobody"". If you are not sure of the difference between ""heavy"" music and ""heavy metal"", buy this album."
3,"Great songs, OK sound quality","I bought ""Captured Live At The Forum"" on CD a couple years ago, and I must say the songs here are great. I have only one complaint about it-the fair-to-poor sound quality. Since I consider myself to be an avid fan of Three Dog Night, I felt it necessary to include this CD in my collection. Since it's TDN's only live CD in print, you'll want to add it to your collection, too."
1,incompetents,I ordered a slide projector to review old slides and a replacement lamp as suggested. The firm sent two slide projectors and no lamp. P.s. the slide projector costs more than the lamp so it was carelessness rather than greed.
1,Way over priced!,Returned immediately! A one dollar item that somebody was trying to make eight dollars from selling. Thanks to Amazon for refunding me so quickly.
2,not worth the postage,Look around before for you send for this because the postage is almost more than the item.
3,His first solo effort,in 1970 Eric Clapton came out with his first solo album.What you have here is him recording essentially with Delaney and Bonnie's band.The songs of note on this album are his version of After Midnight which to this day is one of his classics.He also has his classic Let It Rain on this albumEasy Now is another fine acoustic song I would recommend that is on this CD.Bottle of Red Wine is a good Rocker with a short but sweet guitar solo.For a first effort not a bad album.
4,EC's Debut,"Eric Clapton's debut solo release is loose and bluesy effort that has the feel of an extended jam session with friends. In fact, many of his friends do play on the album including Delaney & Bonnie, Stephen Stills and other. The contains Mr. Clapton's definitive version of J.J. Cale's ""After Midnight"" as well as other blues driven numbers like ""Bottle Of Red Wine"", ""Lonesome & A Long Way From Home"" and ""Lovin' You, Lovin' Me"". Mr. Clapton's guitar playing is crisp and his voice expressive. The best cut on the album is the closer, ""Let It Rain"", that contains a ripping guitar solo and a strong vocal performance. A solid debut from a man who already had accomplished so much."
5,Classic Clapton,"To be honest, my actual rating for this album is 3 stars. I mean, who among you would try to tell me that cuts like ""Slunky"" or ""Bad Boy"" rate with the weaker tunes on the better Clapton albums? But I labeled this with 5 stars because of the place is fills in rock history and the development of Clapton's music. I consider ""Blues Power"" to be one of the all-time great rock tunes. ""Let It Rain"" and ""Bottle of Red Wine"" are other gems in this set. I like ""After Midnight"", but I like the original by J. J. Cale better. So I can't realistically give this 5 stars like other classic albums where each and every tune is great, but I'll tack on 2 to the 3 it deserves just beacuse it was a turning point in Eric's career that rang true to me at the time.The sound quality of the CD is not the greatest, even for its era, with easily audible distortion in the loud parts and a fairly flat soundstage. My old vinyl copy sounds better."
4,Good Album,"Eric Clapton's debut solo album is fun, enjoyable but lightweight. While the compositions are solid none have the depth of his best work (such as Layla and his Cream albums). The performances are solid, Clapton's vocals are strong (for Clapton)but his guitar isn't showcased quite as much as one would hope. The backing band keeps in line but producer Delaney Bramlett choses arragnements that give too much space to the band instead of Clapton's expert playing. That said, the production here is solid, faithful, acoustic, and natural early 70s, without the bombastic AOR slickness that plagued many artists in the upcoming years. Not Clapton's very best release but one of his best solo records and an enjoyable and fun album."
5,sweet as pie,"Clapton's eponymous solo debut encapsulates everything that makes him not just a great picker, but a great musician. Every song is written, sung and played with just the right touch. He has taken the torrential blues of his early bands, mixed in the psychedelic mayhem of Cream, and served it on a bed of tasty country fried pop. Clapton catching his musical breath just before the jump into the stratosphere with brother Duane and the boys."
2,Disappointed,"I have been awaiting the publication of this book for several months after I discovered it was forthcoming. If you are looking for a checklist of wild orchids with sharp color pictures then this is for you. For myself it lacked detailed information of the various orchids. This is likely not possible or the book would be too large to easily carry with you into the field. My suggestion is find an orchid book for your region that can concentrate on the local varieties. In my area of the Midwest, I would suggest ""Orchids of the Western Great Lakes Region"" by Frederick W. Case, Jr. That book is an older book but contains some very useful information."
1,Orchids of North America,The book serves as good checklist for the North American species. It should not be construed as anything more than that. The photos are subpar.
1,crap,mug and bits are both crap. Bits all broke and mug leaks out the lid and bottom. Not a good buy.
5,Great Product,The book came in really quickly and commuication with the buyer was easy. The product was like brand new.
3,great shipper fast,"Was excited to get calendar quickly, but disappointed in the shipping price. won't be ordering anymore as to the shipping is unacceptable. the calendar doesn't have the month on them either or room to print the month. that was disappointing because when i put the month in, it has to be small."
2,Monster MCL MSTMINI 2FM 1/4 Dual Mono Female to Single 1/8 Stereo Male Cable Adapter,"I am not sure about this particular Monster cable.This is the third one I am buying, and I am having problems. I bought the first one many months ago, it looks professional, sturdy and heavy duty, but the performance is questionable. One female channel was not working right from the beginning (intermittent lose connection), but I kept the product anyway. I bought another cable just recently and it came defective (one channel not working). I sent it back and within a few days they send me a brand new one. I have not tried out the new one yet, I hope it works."
2,Not Fast Enough,"A computer book should, first and foremost, allow one to quickly and concisely reference something. Very few are structured this way and this book is no exception. Not enough illustrations, not elaborately indexed, and too much text combine to make this book ineffective for my needs. I should be able to pick it up and find my answer immediately. The ""Dummies"" books are on the right track but too elementaryfor more advanced users. How about an ""Advanced Dummies"" series?"
1,A waste of money,"After installing MacOS X, I had enough questions and problems that I thought a good introductory book would help. I immediately ordered this book. By the time it arrived, it was already too basic - I'd figured out the things the book claims to cover.Between simple experimentation and using Help, you will quickly learn more than you will ever get from reading this book.In addition, the book is padded with information about thestatus of various 3rd-party programs running on Mac OS X. This information was obsolete before the book left the printers! To find out about the status of 3rd-party apps, visit Apple's website or the various company websites."
2,A waste of money for all but beginners,"Rushed to market to cash in early this book is superficial and not helpful to any but genuine beginners. Even they will do better to wait until more comprehensive texts appear after the issuance of System X.1 in late September, which will modify and improve the system significantly and provide the basis on which most key applications will be written.Even now there are several better choices on the market."
3,"Too simple, too soon.","First I want to say that this review in no way reflects on Mr Steinberg's writing ability. The book is sold as an intermediate to advanced book and I think that is a stetch. While this book would be good to put in the Box with X , it is not fo rthe seasoned Mac Techie. Too much comparison between OS 9 and X on simple stuff I found out after installing it and using it on two different computers over period of a couple of weeks at the most. In fact I learned stuff on my own that's not in the book. I hope the other books on X are more detailed and indepth, getting into the Unix under belly. If you are going to be Mac techie, you have to go there."
3,Stop Gap 'Til the Missing Manual Comes Out,"Though it's marketed as a book for intermediate to advanced users, as suggested by the other reviewers, it's really designed as a get acquainted guide for everyday Mac users - those who will never look at the command line - not power users, never mind those with Unix experience. It doesn't supply you with much beyond what the Missing Manuals book will when it comes out (if it's anything like the OS9 version), and isn't as easy on the head as the Missing Manual series books are. If you're completely at sea with OS X and have to learn more now, pick it up; but don't expect to walk away an OS X guru."
2,Avoid this book if you want an in-depth look at OS X,"This book is very good if you are used to working in Mac OS 9 and you want to know how to do things in OS X that you did in OS 9. It covers where to find features and conrol panels that you are used to accessing in OS 9, and if that's what you want then this is a good book for you. However, if you want to learn about new features in OS X and more technical explanations to how OS X works then this book is definetly not for you. A huge part of OS X is the NetInfo Directory service and it is not even mentioned in this book."
5,The best Miss Silver!,"I was having trouble finding this book, but I finally did, so that is why I read it out of sequence. I had finished the Miss Silver series some weeks ago. This book was written in 1951, so sometime near the last third of Miss Silver's long writing career, but it is by far the best in the series. In it we have all kinds of good things. The best part of the book is that we see our indomitable Miss Silver returning to her former profession as governess. She does this in order to get herself inside a household where strange things have been hanppening, and the latest in these strange things was the disappearenace of a young woman who had been employed in the position that Miss Silver assumes. This is a lively story with lots of eccentric characters, ss well as bank robberies, fraud and murder. This is a fine example of an English cozy, and I'm glad that I finally found the book."
5,Knitting peacefully through murder.,"I love Miss Silver. She sees through the wicked and the good with equal acumen, helps the helpless, and gets her knitting done.A young girl who is looking for a lost friend, and an artists' colony that may or may not be what it seems make a fine place to display a set of characters. I especially like the talkative weavers.In this book, we get to see Miss Silver, the former governess, acting as--a governess!"
1,BEWARE!!!!!!,"This is NOT another book in the series - this is a REPEAT of ""Death at Deep End"" number 20. I HATE WHEN THEY REPUBLISH BOOKS WITH ANOTHER TITLE AND TRICK YOU INTO BUYING IT TWICE. Don't fall for it!!!! Thomasina and Anna Ball."
5,The Beginning of All Wisdom,"Reading this review sends a signal: you are interested in buying and driving a 50 year old Porsche. And, if this be so, there is no better starting point than this book. Although written a decade ago, Schrager's advice and insights remain timelessly relevant. Simply put, buy and read the book before you get serious about spending the kind of money a decent 356 costs today. The modest outlay will be the best pre-investment you can make. Schrager will take you on an interesting and highly readable journey during which you'll learn a little about a lot: history, nomenclature, opportunities, and pitfalls in searching for the car that's right for you. Only in terms of the prices is Schrager as out-of-date as a narrow necktie. There is a Chinese proverb which goes: ""the beginning of all wisdom lies in calling things by their proper names."" For the prospective Porsche 356 buyer, most of those proper names appear in this book. It worked for me. Thanks, Jim."
5,lisle 43300 pneumatic fan clutch wrench set 8 piece,"I bought this set to remove the BMW fan clutch. This set is perfect, it come with 32mm already you don't have to buy addictional that they recomment when check out at the end."
2,NOT a self-help book,"The authors of this book obviously wrote it for other like-minded professionals (and those seeking to make psycholgy their profession). It's nowhere near readable as a self-help book. Unless you're a psycholgist-in-training, don't waste your time or money with this one. If you're going to look at it from an academic standpoint, then this is the book for you!"
1,This book is one of the worst programming books out now.,"I'm completely disappointed in this book. I've been doing database work for 15 years, and the author clearly has little or no experience with real-world issues. I taught myself JDBC from Sun's published documentation, and hoped this book would fill in some gaps for me, but it didn't. The example code is not always explained, and it seems as though the text author didn't write the example code. I am still waiting for a good JDBC book."
1,This book contains an unacceptable number of errors.,"Don't waste your money on this book. The book starts out good. The first two chapters are well written and informative. Unfortunately, this book is peppered with errors. The errors are so obvious that the author and McGraw-Hill should be ashamed to publish it in its current state (the first programming example won't even compile!)."
2,Dont pay for this one,This books has alot of errors and I would not pay more then $1 for it. But this books is a ok (not great) paper weight
4,Very Helpful Book,This book is very helpful for a starter like me. It explains all the fundamentals clearly.
2,Small blessing in disguise,This book sure has a lot of typos and coding pring errors. It must be a source of great embarassment to Mcgraw-Hill. The braces have wrong scoping making it impossible to compile without putting in a lot of analysis. This is very frustrating to novices like myself.Otherwise the book as been very lucidly written for individuals who need a jumpstart on learning and using JDBC.Another good feature (in disguise) is that one can learn how to debug dirty code. Unless you specualte you cannot accumulate!
2,I don't need the lecture,"I lost my respect for rammstein with the release of Amerika. I was a fan for their music, but I don't need to be lectured to. I don't need *germans* preaching about how imperialistic and corrupt my country is. When I put in a rock album, the last thing I want is to be fed anti-american propaganda. And have no doubt that this is anti-american propaganda. ""We'll hurt you if you don't like us!"" The country that provides more humanitarian support than any other on earth? The country that single-handedly protects 23 million Taiwanese and 28 million South Korean from a real imperialistic threat? The country that has saved europe two times in the last century? Who has germany ever helped?"
5,"Anno ""tookson"" you are a douche bag","Anno ""tookson"" wtf are you talking about no where in the entire song does it say anything bad about america. all they are saying is america came up with such things as coka cola and mickey mouse. i don't know what song you are listening to but if you got anti american from it it surtainly isn't this one."
4,Fun song,"I really couldnt say im a huge fan of Rammstein but i do like them. I recently came upon this song and even though I am a conservative, pro American patriot(lol) I do love this song despite its obvious cheap shots at ""Amerika"" Like one of the other Reviewers said, sometimes we need to laugh at ourselves. The song isnt malicious nor does it land any low blows its simply a satire of how commercial America has become. Whats strikes me as funny....is that Europe is just as commercial they just dont like to admit it. Which is why i suppose these guys say ""We all live in Amerika"""
3,A Disappointment,"I enjoyed the first 200 pages of this book - the background, police investigation and trial. Ainslie then descends into psycho-babble, introspection and even admits to thinking that King could be innocent, such is the apparent power of this man over others. No matter how much Ainslie tries to muddy the waters, King was judged to be guilty of a cold blooded, callous crime. For Ainslie to imply at the end of the book that we are all not far removed from behaving like that is ridiculous. He even assigns part of the blame to Christianity!"
5,Excellent book for dads,"This book is an excellent resource for fathers. The book describes how to follow St. Joseph, affirming Christ's lordship over our families, loving our wives, educating our children in the instruction of the lord, etc. Good resource for small mens discussion groups, too."
2,Dasappointed,"I love marimba and Latin music in general. I was expecting more relaxing, soothing and/or upbeat type of music. In my opinion most pieces on this cd were of serious nature and dark at times, not my kind of music.I wish there were sample tracks to listen to and save me some money."
5,Highly recommended,I have thoroughly enjoyed listening to this cd. The marimba is enchanting...the music of Orlando Cotto both soothing and complex. My favorites on this unique cd are Caribenos and Piedra en la Piedra. Great stuff!
5,Barry McGuire's songs,This brought back great memories. I remember when it first came out. Eve ofDestruction - what a song!!! It still rings TRUE today after all these years. The rest of the songs on the cd are quite good as well. I would recommend this to a friend for sure.
1,ken Van,I tried this drill for installing metal siding and roofing. The first one lasted 2 weeks and the second lasted 1 week. The switch to change from high to low speed died on both. I then spent another 20 dolars and bought the Makita 14.4 volt. 1 year later it is still going strong. I also bought the Dewalt palm sander with the variable speed and the VS switch lasted 6 months before it died. The good news is that I bought the drils at Home Depot and they replaced them with out question.
4,Arthur Hayhoe needs Grammar and Spelling Lessons,"I wasn't even going to look at Mr. LaPierre's book until I saw the simplistic and grammatically challenged ""review"" posted by one ""Arthur Hayhoe."" If the only ""review"" this guy can dish up is comprised almost exclusively of his own warmed-over leftist ideology and revisionist history, then LaPierre must be on to something."
5,B.J. Thomas CD Reunion,"This Cd is without doubt one of the best work B.J.Thomas has ever done. All of the songs in this cd are great! especially the songs ""Hey Won't You Play Another Somebody Done Somebody Wrong Song"",Crying, & Beautiful Things For You"".I recommend this Cd for Anyone Who Loves B.J.Thomas & His music As much as I do! sincerely,Lorna C DuBourdieu"
1,Fat Cat Magnetic Note Pad,This magnetic pad is useless because the note pad is too heavy for the magnetic strip and the note pad falls off of its backing along with the magnetic strip.
3,Not as useful as the title suggests.,"Axtell's capsule treatments of various cultures are too superficial for all but the most oblivious travelers. In his attempt to include a multitude of countries and customs, nothing gets decent coverage. Though it's doubtful anyone would expect a book about using English to serve as a foreign-language phrasebook, the brief appendix tries to do just that, contributing to the book's scattershot feel.The Church Lady seems to have ghostwritten five pages of Chapter 5, where we are informed of the Canadians' ""special heritage,"" Quebecers' ""special pride in their ethnic heritage,"" and Australians' ""special brand of coined and abbreviated words,"" not to mention their ""special brand of lingo.""This book is for you if you're an after-dinner speaker who needs cute anecdotes about language and cultural snafus, or if lists of misstatements like ""Our Father who art in heaven, Howard be thy name,"" send you into convulsions of laughter. But it's not essential travel reading."
3,Satisfied,"Respectable shipping speed, cost felt high for a simple book that acts as a dictionary for artistic terms but it is what it is. Unless you are an art enthusiast this book may not be very necessary."
2,pretty slim for an A-Z record of Art History,I was expecting a much more deeply detailed book for something calling itself an A-Z handbook. Many of the words my Art 101 teacher gave us were not listed in this book. I'm still trying to figure out why she recommended this book to us!
5,Perfect Gift for my Graduate!,"This item was a perfect gift for my daughter who graduated from nursing school last week. Only I remember her as a child ""playing nurse"" with her dolls. Now she's all grown up and has her first nursing job in a large emergency room. This figurine will remind her of her early years with me, her mom."
4,Riveting,"When someone starts killing nurses at a prestigious L.A. hospital, forsenic pathologist Joanna Blalock decides to investigate and is thrown into a spiraling vortex of deceit and danger that pits her against a murderer. It has been quite a while since I've read such a compulsively readable medical thriller. This book kept me guessing ""whodunnit"" right until the very end. If you like Robin Cook and Michael Palmer, you'll really enjoy Leonard Goldberg."
2,"Solid, enjoyable read but below average for the genre","Deadly Medicine is one of many books in the science/medical thriller genre that I have reviewed for my website ScienceThrillers. This book follows the standard hospital thriller format, with a smart, strong-willed female pathologist who is the only person with the guts and brains to solve the case. The story is part thriller, part mystery, but the mystery aspect of the plot is only weakly mysterious. Characters are likable but shallow. I recommend this book to hard-core fans of medical thrillers, but it isn't one of the best. Visit my website to find better choices, in particular, books by Michael Palmer, Robin Cook, CJ Lyons."
5,Draft Day HAT,"great hat, it had to be just out of the factory cause it had that new car smell to it. Didn't take very long to get to me, i believe they gave me shipment tracking. it took about a week and a half to process and ship the hat, great service, really loved the hat."
5,Can't be better!,"This book always gives me surprises whenever I try something new. Its simple, easy to follow recipes make a housework idiot like me a perfect cook."
5,Excellent!,"I love this book. A nice combination of sandwiches, appetizers, scones, muffins and mini desserts. Also a few different brewing methods for tea included too."
5,The Book of Afternoon Tea,This was life saver. Reasonably priced. Easy reading. Have loaned to other tea etiquette seekers.
4,What a pleasure,I was so impressed when I got this book. It had everything I was looking or hoping for and more. I got some great ideas out of this book and the Afternoon high tea we held was a great success with loads of yummy food that everyone enjoyed.
2,Not quite what I expected.,The book has many simple recipes but I was more interested in the presentation of the food not just the recipe. Unfortunately the book does not cover the garnishing steps.
4,Great Stars and Talent - Very Disappointing Quality,"I looked forward to seeing this since I saw it in the theatre in the '50's. It was sad to see the poor quality of such a great musical. I was disappointed and doubt if I will purchase more musicals from the same people who put this out. They did a diservice to a fine musical, not only with poor sound quality but by not putting the whole movie in widescreen, not just the end number."
5,Hit the Deck DVD,Love these old movies and as a dancer all my life I enjoy seeing the greatroutines and choreography. Great movie
1,Hit the Deck DVD,"The sound is terrible. It is not a clear picture, faces almost unrecognizable. The music is a complete disaster.It is like this ... made in someones basement with a brownie box camera.Harriet Russ"
2,Nothing Daunted,"I heard about the book on NPR but the story line was not exactly the same as discussed on the show. I read it anyway and the heavy Christian bible belting in it was a turn off. Missionaries trying to turn people into Christians who have for centuries followed religious practices that fit their culture and lifestyle just doesn't sit right. A couple so religious that they sent their only young child away to school in favor of working as a missionary was irritating. I'm a family first person and they failed in my book to take care of the child before their ""calling."""
4,Interesting,"Not dramatic. These were interesting but not poignant, as I was expecting. There were a few outcries against the hideous war, but mostly these diaries were stopped before the dreadful conclusions, of course.The children sometimes had very good insights, and sometimes they were just normal children.Very interesting."
3,Poor wing nuts,"As others stated, the wing nuts on these are junk. I bought 2 packs of these and all four wing nuts are cracked after the first ride. I am going to replace them with regular metal nuts and see. The reflectors don't reflect much either but they help me meet the requirements of reflective space."
2,Cheap plastic,"Unfortunatly the bolt and wing nut on these are plastic. I bought 2 pairs of these, and snapped the wingnut on 3 of them trying to get it tight. The ones at my local motorcycle shop have a metal bolt and wingnut and are much more durable. I'm not sure that you could really use these to hold on a license plate without them break and end up losing your plate. Additionally, the reflectors are not very reflective, which defeats the purpose of them"
3,Ok for the price,"I got these and wanted to use them for a license plate.However, I snapped the plastic wing nut that holds one of them on.Just be careful when you tighten them."
5,A Dating Must Have,"Anyone with baggage, emotional and/or (romantic) relationship conflict should read this book. I would go so far as to say that it should be a prerequisite for dating in general. It frees daters to return to an old fashioned method of courting. It teaches the fundamentals of building relationships while encouraging the reader to do internal inventories, making its readers more emotionally healthy partners!"
4,Love Quarky's,These came a bit more narrow than the first pair I had bought 10 years ago (which I am still wearing!) but very comfortable still. They last forever and are light as a feather!
4,Foam roller - shoulder relief,"A foam roller was recommended to me by my physical therapist. This one has served me well, my shoulder is healing and it is also helping with my upper back tension. I would recommend this product any time."
1,Imitation Roller,"I used one of these rollers with my Physical Therapist for weeks and it always worked and retained its shape. When I went to buy one to use at home, I saw that they were 40 dollars or more. So, I bought this one off of Amazon for 10 dollars. A mistake. After 2 uses...TWO it was completely warped and lost its shape and really does not work. After I tied to use it the other day (my 3rd time) I determined that I have no choice but to throw it out and go buy a real foam roller from a sporting goods store. It is a shame; I had such high hopes. I guess I now know why it was so cheap."
2,too soft to hold up,"When I (Aben's wife) first got this foam roller I was excited that it was a little softer than the one I borrowed from my trainer. I could barely stand to roll my IT Bands at all on hers, so I liked that my body could handle this one better. The problem is that the foam in this roller compresses very easily. In only a handful of uses, I saw it compressing where I'd rolled on it. My husband has used it a couple of times also and it just keeps compressing. (I was going to return it but didn't get on it fast enough as my time ran out on the return yesterday.) So, 31 days in with maybe 14 uses total and the center of the roller is compressed to about 2/3's of the original diameter. It does not go back to normal, once the compression takes place, it's just that way. I would not recommend this foam roller. Spend the extra and get a better one. The length of it feels unnecessarily long to me also. I find myself desiring to cut it in half. Just sayin'."
1,Foam Roller turns into Limp Noodle,"While this product is very low-priced, one should consider the old adage, ""You get what you pay for!"". At first, it worked like a high quality foam roller. However, after about two weeks of usage on my upper and lower back, it lost its shape to the point where the circumference at the center of the roller was about 1/2 of the circumference at the ends. In other words, it looked like it had been stretched to point where the middle thinned. Don't buy unless you only intend to use it for a very short time."
1,Cheap product,"Bought this because of price and to see if it would help my back. I only weight 170, used it about 5 times and it's already sagging in the middle. You get what you pay for. Now that I know what results I can get from theses rollers, I'll buy the $30 one."
3,Review of Foam Roller,Foam Roller arrived on time and in good condition.Started using it and got some instant results but now it seems that the roll is too soft.Have seen some other ones that are much firmer and would be worth the extra money.
4,Great Product for Post-workout Recovery,"I'm a fitness nut, but I found that even when I was in my best shape there were still times I'd be sore after a workout. One of my friends suggested using a foam roller post-workout. Since using this product my soreness is pretty much non-existent, especially in my quads and hamstrings.. Instead of paying $60 an hour for a sports massage, I think a foam roller should do the trick."
1,foam roller,"It is not in a good shape all around. The item is not good as shown in the picture.36"" Full Round Foam Rollers Size: 36"" x 4"""
2,Poor Quality Roller,"This is not as good of quality as you will find when you work with your PT. If I ever order another one, I would pay extra to get a better quailty. After using it a few times it also became uneven in diameter."
2,foam roller,Round foam roller is now an oval foam roller after only a few uses. Doesn't really hold its shape for long which makes it hard to roll on without holding it with one of your hands...you get what you pay for.
2,"CHEAP, FOAM SQUISHES","It does it's job I guess...but it is cheap. I will probably buy another well made, better quality one that will stay round and be more useful that way. I bought it to use with my P90X2 program and after one week of using it, it's deformed."
5,Great!,Great price for a great item! I searched for these here in Canada and they are 4 times more expensive for the same thing...................
2,Roller flimsy,"Very low density. Already bent out of shape. Next time I hope to find out the density before I order. I should have remembered that you buy cheap, you get a cheap product."
3,Styrafoam Roller,"I purchased this roller because I had a smaller one given to me and it helped alleviate my back pain. I thought a bigger longer one would give me more control and more surface and it has! The only thing I'm not happy about is its made out of styrafoam and its too hard. My small one is made out of some kind of neprene rubber or something like that and is a little softer but still firm. I do like the yours, I just can't use it as long and I don't think the foam will last as long as my rubber one will."
5,Works great,The foam roller was exactly want I needed. My PT had warn me about most local stores that sell them are not the grade that they use for PT. Awesome prices cheapest price in town.
5,Foam roller was exacty what I expected,"This foam roller, which I must use for some physical therapy exercises, arrived promptly. I couldn't find it in any ""walk-in"" stores near my home, so I was please to be able to purchase it on the internet."
1,Not Firm Enough,"The roller has the proper dimensions, but deforms under your weight. Unfortunately, it's not appropriate for back exercises. I bet it would make an excellent pool floatie, though."
1,soft,This product was softer than what I was expecting. i hardly use b/c I needed something firmer to roll out my muscles.
1,Ehh..,Great price does not equal great quality. Not what I was expecting at all. Has too much give to it. Not firm enough so it doesn't target muscles or knots well. So practically useless in essence.
5,Inexpensive and as-advertised,The roller was everything it appeared to be. It felt very durable. I've used it a handful of times now and have no complaints.
4,good buy,"very happy with product it came as described and was here quickly, will definitely buy more next time i get a chance"
2,More packing material than workout equipment,This feels like it was a foam packing tube re-purposed and sold as something it is not suited for. The quality and finish are ridiculous. The foam is far too soft to be a roller for a human. It also warps almost immediately. Don't waste your money get something from a sports store.
2,Disappointed but will get the job done,"I was expecting a black roller as advertised but received a white roller instead, which is less firm and loses it's shape very quickly. I have to apply more pressure when using this roller to get the same deep message effect but it does get the job done. This roller is a lot cheaper than the other rollers advertised and it is a prime example of ""you get what you pay for"". If you want better quality, more firmness and durability, I would suggest springing for a more expensive brand. If were to do it all over again, I definitely would pay the extra money."
2,Bad Foam Roll,I have been longing for a foam roller due to a bad back since my recent move. I used to work at a Physical Therapy office and would use one on a daily basis. I saw them around but figured I could get a more affordable one online. I found this one which was delivered from the east coast in a trashbag which allowed it to look like the leaning tower of piza upon arrival. After that i used it once and noticed that it was in even worse shape than arrival but figured the foam would puff back up and look as normal as it could. This was not the case...over time it got worse and worse.I will never buy from this seller again! I would love to get my money back. This is the first bad experience I've had with Amazon.com.
1,Crushed after a month of use,"I hurt my IT band and I was counting on a foam roller to help me out. For the most part this did the job, but it began to sag in the middle where I rolled on it.After a month, it is more of an ellipse shape than a circle. So rolling is no longer effective."
1,"Shrunk with use, not stable",Unfortunately the foam in this did not hold up. After several uses the center area collapsed to about four inches and has not expanded back to the correct shape. I don't think the foam is stable enough. Also when trying to roll it tends to flatten to an egg shape that skids on hardwood floors. I don't recommend this one.
3,Foam Roller,"Ordered the item expecting it to be a black foam roller like in the advertised picture, but my assumption was wrong. I got the white foam roller, which isn't necessarily bad but not what I had wanted (the firmness and lifespan differs with each color). Otherwise very prompt shipping from the seller and good packaging."
5,Why spend more?,This was the cheapest foam roller I found at the time. I have been told that there are cheaper but this one works great. It is dense foam and works great for foam rolling exercises and stretching (including p90x2).
5,Great,"This is a great foam roller. Works for stretching many different muscles before and after working out. The fact it is 36"" long makes a huge difference from shorter rollers. Firm foam really gets in there and works out the knots."
4,Helped give my exercises a new dimension,"I bought a roller to go with a new exercise DVD (Karen Voight Sleek Essentials)but find it useful for many things. I use it to add dimension to my pilates workout, I use it as a cheap bench to give me more space to do arm exercises like bench presses, etc.For the price, it was well worth it."
1,Look Elsewhere,"I bought this foam roller for my father for some light use and, suffice to say, it is terrible. While the size is as promised, the roller itself is not uniform as there are ""dents"" and indentations on the roller (this is with no use, by the way). This makes it virtually impossible to get a good rolling experience. Additionally, the foam itself compresses way too much when you do try to use it. I would not recommend and would not buy again even if you looking to use it occasionally. Save your money and look elsewhere."
2,this is not your typical good quality roller,this really is to soft and i would stick to paying a bit more for some quality - feels and works cheap
3,kinda cheap,I thought this was like a yoga roller but it's actually just a hard foam roll. It needs a cover of some sort. It's harder than I thought it would be.
5,massage in a tube,"This roller has helped me work out sore muscles and tendons that I can't reach without it. The price was right and it came very quickly, trhanks a lot!"
3,Wore down after three months of minimal use,"Although it lasted a few months, I was expecting a foam roller of higher quality. This foam roller wore down considerably after, on average, 10 minutes of use a day."
5,Does the trick,"This roller looks like it will last a long time, so I consider it a bargain. The foam looks kinda like soap bubbles, which was not what I expected, but the large cells make it just a little bit squishy -- perfect for sore muscles."
3,OK but not durable,"I purchased this foam roll after attending a class using them for a lot of exercises. I didn't want to spend much and it had good reviews. It came as expected. It was made of open cell foam. I used it for 2 to 3 weeks of light use (mostly IT bands and lumbar spine rolling). Now the roll is much smaller and has lost its shape, the ends are 6 inches diameter and the middle is much smaller. It is no longer straight. I guess you get what you pay for. On the plus side it is a little softer for someone who may not tolerate the harder rolls, the only problem is now it is not circular but more oval shaped and it is hard to roll and no longer good for my use. I will try and attach pictures so that you can see what it looks like after a few weeks."
3,Breaking Down,"At the beginning I was very satisfied by the product. However, after two weeks of use the foam began to loose its shape. This made it much harder to roll. I old weight 160 lbs and am 6 ft. I guess you get what you pay for, but it was a bit disappointing."
4,good foam roller for the price,"I use this to relieve IT Band syndrome. It works well, but out of the box it's extremely hard. It's perfect for the price I paid, but if you're willing to spend more, the blue ones are better (I use the blue ones in Physical Therapy)"
1,its hollow!!!,"Its not hollow in the picture, its not hollow in the description, but the middle ~2 inches of my foam roller is hollow.It deforms under my weight."
1,Item not as pictured - Wasted money,"When received, this foam roller had a 1 1/2"" diameter hole all the way through the center of the roller. This means that the roller will collapse under any weight and not be sufficient for working the IT Band and the surrounding muscles. The roller must be solid to work/massage the interior muscles near the IT band. Don't waste your money."
1,Misleading picture,"The item pictured is the black foam roller which is the harder and firmer foam roller.Instead, I received a white foam roller. The white foam roller is softer and quickly loses it shape.If you scroll down the page, THEN you see the description that it is a white foam roller.MISLEADING!I am returning this... :-/"
1,cheap foam roller,"While this product looks like the high-grade white foam rollers, it's poor quality. The foam is quite soft and becomes permanently indented in very little time. Once this happens, it doesn't roll very well. would not recommend this product."
5,Best $15 I Have Ever Spent!,"I am only 34 years old, but I've had lower back problems for years. I believe this is because I am flat footed. In the past I would always take aspirin/ibuprofen to easy the pain until I started reading more and more people recommending foam rollers for muscle aches. I decided to get one myself and try it. We now anytime I have back pain (which is almost every day) I just roll on this thing for about 15 seconds and voila! pain magically goes away. I was also having pain on the my inner calf from running. I tried tried to relieve it with this and it also made the pain go away! I really am happy that I know longer have to take aspirin/ibuprofen because I've read taking too much ibuprofen may cause stomach ulcers."
2,not bad for the price,I did not want to spend too much on these products so I got this to start. It did help ease minor tightness but the effect was temporary (or perhaps I don't use it enough). It gets deformed after regular use so perhaps firmer ones are better for more serious users.
3,Ouch!,I purchased this to follow up with physical therapy on my neck and shoulder. I found the roll to be very hard and uncomfortable to use. It's also tough getting on & off the roller because it is so stiff. I'm sure it's a personal preference and some may find this roller to perfect for them.
3,Slow read,"The book to me was a very slow read. I was really looking forward to recieving the book and it was not what I thought it was going to be.I do think the author was very brave to write about this very tragic experience, but can't really say I would recommend this book."
4,"Funnest football I've owned, but......","This ball is a lot of fun. Its light so you can really heave it, but not too light where the slightest wind will destroy your spirals. I do recommend it. However, after a couple months use, it split open at the seam! Kind of a bummer since it was only a couple months, and it was only used for tossing around, not tackling or anything. Well, a little super glue fixed it right up, and we're back to having a great time. Just be weary of the weak adhesive they used on this ball."
3,Not Ideal for Older Kids,"While the sponginess of this ball is probably great for little kids who may be afraid to catch a harder football, it is too soft for older kids who are used to gripping regular footballs. Nice, durable ball, but it's not for everyone."
4,Great stuff,"Soilwork comes back strong. I absolutly love soilworks style of music, melodic hardcore, and everything elce that defines sweedish metal. This record dosnt quite match up to natural born chaos, but cirtainly delivers. metal metal metal \m/"
3,"No, bad Soilwork! Keep evolving!","The best description of this album would be Natural Born Chaos II - The Reckoning. It really does sound a lot like NBC, but without the quality. That's not to say that this is a bad album, not at all, and the claims of selling out or nu-metal influence are just plain and utter BS. But with some more time, and perhaps with another Devin Townsend production, it could've been so much better.I think what Soilwork need to do is leave their death metal sound behind completely, and spend a good two or three years coming up with a new album, and make something truly unique and phenomenal. They are so close to breaking completely free of their Gothenburg melodic death roots and into the realm of unique and great progressive metal. I still have high expectations for the future."
5,"If you dont have it yet, GET IT!","As good as, if not better than their ""Natural Born Chaos"" album. As mentioned by other's here, this band hasn't made too many ""bad"" albums. They are deffiitly a gem of an underground band that is slowly becoming more popular. Perfectly blending metal, death metal, and soft rock all into one album. (dont misunderstand the word ""soft"", when I say blended, i mean blended, this is no ""glam"" album, it is heavy) BUY THIS! to any newcomers: if you like Testaments new stuff, Inflames, Fear Factory, Shadows fall (that kind of stuff) then yea might just like this."
4,Best Overall Soilwork Album to Date.,"Not only is there not a bad song on the entire album, but there are some real gems to be heard here. Figure Number Five, Light the Torch, Departure Plan, Distortion Sleep and Downfall 24 are all amazing songs. This album beats out Natural Born Chaos not only because of the number of great songs on it, but because, as mentioned earlier, there isn't a single bad song on it. However, this isn't the most amazing stuff I've ever heard, so it gets 4/5 stars."
2,You've got to be kidding!,"Ok, let me get this straight: I have nothing against heavy bands going melodic. Anathema, Katatonia, In Flames etc have all done it successfully. Soilwork, however, have demonstrated how NOT to do it. Firstly, the technical riffs, blistering speed and heavy groove of earlier releases is now non-existent. Secondly, if you're gonna trade intensity for melody, for God's sake, MAKE IT CATCHY! None of the songs on this album maintained my interest for more than two listens. I now lump Soilwork in with other crap bands like Godsmack, Slipknot etc."
4,not their best but still awesome,"No other band does anything for me quite like this band does. Their sound is just mesmerizing. This CD is good for different reasons than their older stuff. When bands tend to do this sort of thing, it doesn't sound good usually but this band does it well. The solos and riffs and thrash isn't really there anymore but they make up for it all with just so much melody. Especially in the singing. It's so mesmerizing you can't turn away. The only bad song on here is Brickwalker. I heard 2 songs from their upcoming release Stabbing The Drama and it appears theyve still got it and theyre bringing back some of the older aspects of their music as well. Like thrash beats and some longer solos. I can't wait till it comes out. All their CDs from Steelbath up to this one are nothing short of awesome."
2,Not Everything From Sweden is Gold...,"I got turned on to Soilwork via some testimonials on an Opeth message board, so I purchased FNF song unheard from a local record shop. Serves me right...For the life of me, I don't understand why someone who appreciates the incredibly talented band Opeth would be interested in this paint-by-numbers Pantera clone. The two bands are nothing alike, other than they both originate out of Sweden.There are absolutely a ton of great Swedish bands out there (Flower Kings, Opeth, Anekdoten...), but this isn't one of them. In short, if you like Pantera and want to hear another band pretend they're Pantera, they you'll like this. If you want advanced musicianship, songwriting, and head banging goodness, go buy Opeth's Deliverance."
1,A tuned up version of Disturbed,"I'm not really a big fan of commercialized metal in general so this opinion may come off as bias. I would tell anyone who wants to buy this cd to instead go buy a Disturbed album. Why? Because this band came off to me as a really bad version of pop metal. You take away Disturbed's monkey noises and write NO creative riffs at all and you get Soilwork. I think this bands popularity comes soley from people who walk around saying things like ""I love Soilwork! I love the underground music scene!"" blah blah blah. Granted, some underground music is great, but then again this is a prime example of a band that doesnt deserve success. Their is no original material here, nothing you havent heard before, but then again that also describes whats on the radio nowadays so what do I know."
4,a very good album,very good... some really catchy tunes. just an all around good band. i recommend this and other albums from soilwork.
3,"Eh, solid.","The problem is that all these new metal bands sound the same nowadays. I can't distinguish one band from another. Soilwork, however, at least does it well. I approve."
3,Natural Born Chaos Lite,"Let me start by saying if your just getting into Soilwork DON'T BUY THIS, start with Natural Born Chaos or A Predator's Portrait since they are much better. Figure Number Five goes in the same direction as Natural Born Chaos but is less heavy, more trendy and sounds like maybe they decided to use riffs that weren't quite good enough to make it on Natural Born Chaos. Thankfully the riffs on Natural Born Chaos were very good so even the stuff that didn't make it is still decent. If you own all their other stuff you might as well buy this too since, while it isn't as good as their older material, it's still pretty good. And while this album does follow the nu-metal trend more than I like, it still kicks Disturbed's ass anyday. I recommend buying anything from Susperia, At the Gates, Shadows Fall, In Flames, and old Soilwork before you get this."
4,Definately not the Best Soilwork But I enjoyed It,"I think alot of people were way to hard on this cd... Don't underestimate me eather i listen to some Hardcore stuff (The Haunted, Nothingface)!! I will tell you all that I was perfectly pleased with this album. Did Soilwork tone it down? Yes they did... but it is a cd that i enjoyed very much.... I think this cd was underestimated huge... I did enjoy Soilworks other cd's SteelBath Suicide rocked my world and Natural Born Chaos Blew me away... as for Preditor's Portrait and Chain Heart Machine those to cds practically never leave my side! All I can say is Soilwork is NOT selling out with this record ...All i can say is there are better Soilwork cds by far but do not brush this one off and moan about how Soilwork is ""going down the tube"" becasue they aren't and I'm sure they will release another brutal devastatingly shocking cd next time around."
2,Boring,"These guys are awesome and I was really psyched to get this disc. They have been getting better and better too..until now. This CD is really boring. Every song has the exact same formula, and the guitar solos that I loved on the previous releases are gone. There are solos there but they are short and good, but on Natural Born Chaos they are so damn good it's scary.Skip this one if you don't have other stuff from their discography yet. Get Dark Tranquillity's ""Damage Done""."
3,ITS OKAY I SUPPOSE,"Some nice vocals, some nice guitar stuff.Nothing really super duper, not as good as Natural Born Chaos. Good but not great. Nuff said."
4,Figure Number Five - continuing Soilwork's new direction,"Figure Number Five (FNF) carries on from where Soilwork left off with Natural Born Chaos (NBC) and is a worthy successor to what I feel was the best metal album of 2002. Working with Devin ""SYL"" Townsend has obiously helped Soilwork broaden their horizons from the very focused yet brilliant first 3 albums and completes the trend started in a Predator's Portrait (APP).The album is more melodic and dynamic than NBC but falls short on the agression scales, but is a way better balanced effort thn APP. All that remains is to be seen if they can pull the songs off live but this album will win them new fans and keep the legion loyal!"
1,be forwarned...,"others have detailed the gist of the three stories very well. My main thing I want to get across is that in the first story, Counting Crows by Mercedes Lackey, the heroine, is brutally RAPED by her husband, in shocking detail.I was not expecting that in a romance, and it ruined the entire book for me. If reading disturbing scenes like that would bother you, then I highly suggest you either skip this book or at least skip Miss Lackey's story."
2,"2 Duds, one Gem in the rough","Counting Crows-Mercedes Lackey's first foray into the official romance genre is not up to her previous works' standard. The plot drags, I had difficulty connecting to the characters, and the romance reminded me more of one of the old 'courtly love' tales, with less oomph. Not her best work by any stretch of the imagination.Drusilla's Dream-Rachel Lee's premise is a good one but the novella's length did not allow for enough plot and character development. It was choppy and very hard to follow. Not up to her usual standards.Moon Glow-This is my first contact with Catherine Asaro's work but I am very impressed. The plot twists delightfully, I can relate with the characters, and no one is perfect. I will definetly be on the look out for more of her work."
3,Lackey's story is the only good one here....,"I did enjoy Lackey's attention to detail and her story was very good, with a nice surprising twist tucked away. ""Drusilla's Gift"" irritated me - too much shifting around, although I did like both main characters. I was also never really clear on what was going on. I normally enjoy Catherine Asaro's writing, but found this story totally predictable and Iris' dialect more than a bit annoying. Another annoyance goes to the publisher - please make sure that the names are RIGHT on the book jacket - that is an apprentice editor's mistake!Three stars for the interesting Mercedes Lackey, with some credit given to interesting world-building from Catherine Asaro."
2,"The good, the better, and the terrible","As a Mercedes Lackey fan (who's never read any of her series works), I picked up this book with the hope of finding some new author to read.The Lackey story is quite good - an Arthurian-type tale which has a stronger Gwen than most.The Asaro story is also quite good, though I wished that it could be longer. The plot and characters needed more time to be fully developed.The Lee story is wasted space. I had to brush my teeth after reading it; it was such tripe that it left a bad taste in my mouth. The story is completely implausible, even given my proclivity for alternative fiction. The characters are almost one-dimensional, though there is one twist that was unexpected. Mostly, it was a waste of my valuable reading time.That story pulled down the collection, for me. But the other two are worth reading. From the library.(*)>"
3,Two out of Three ain't bad,"Mercedes Lackey wrote a good story with a strong female lead. Although times were tough for the heroine, she prevails in the end (even if the ending seemed a bit rushed).I had never read anything by Rachel Lee before. The story idea was good, but I really didn't like her writing style...it seemed very simplistic. I found myself laughing out loud at some parts, but not because of the humor...because of the absurdity.Catherine Asaro's tale was very good. It was a nice, fluffy fantasy with good characters. If you like this tale, read The Charmed Sphere which takes the story even further.Overall, a good read. I wouldn't spend $20 on the book, but for $5.85 its not a bad deal."
3,"Asrao shines with ""Moonglow""","In this foray into fantasy-romance, I was mostly disappointed. Counting Crows by Mercedes Lackey is marginally good but more a tale of spousal abuse than romance. The second story, ""Drusilla's Dream"", by Rachel Lee isn't even worth reading. Too convoluted to make any sense and too boring to make you care enough to overlook it.But the last story by Catherine Asaro (Moonglow) is compelling and captivating. The only detractor is that it felt like it should have been a novel of it's own. I was left feeling the incompleteness. I almost didn't get through Lee's story to get to read Asaro's, but I'm glad I plunged through since the third story definitely makes the book."
4,Catherine Asaro is an author to watch,"Before this anthology, I'd never read any works by these authors. Catherine Asaro's Moonglow was my favorite of the three stories, with a hero and heroine I could truly root for, a gentle but sensual love story, and a world I enjoyed inhabiting for a short while. I look forward to reading more of Catherine Asaro's work, and will definitely be reading The Charmed Sphere when it is released by Luna."
5,Best book,Mr.Lanier! You have fans in the Ukraine!!!! Please consider that and write the third book for the Trilogy on the Hiero's adventures!!!!!!!!!!! Please! Your first book has changed my thoughts about many things!!! I am greatly appreciate your work!!!! Thank you very much!!! Valentin
4,This Great Saga Will Not Continue,"Why I am new to the world of non-fiction, Sterling Lanier has enraptured me. The book's exquisite description and excellent character developement have made a a fan of his, and Hiero's. I'd also like to say that I recently read Lanier's works on the suggestion of his sister, whom I met on a train ride from Munich, Germany to Vienna, Austria. She did not go without mentioning to me that her brother has passed, that she missed him very much, and that Hiero's adventures could not continue for this reason. For all of the Sterling Lanier fans out there, enjoy what you have, for the saga of Hiero will not continue."
3,Good book but poorly formatted,"Briefly summarizing my review for Hiero's Journey [Kindle Edition], the book itself deserve 4 stars for a good and original story, but some very naive, if not say cheesy, resolutions of protagonist's deadly challenges. However, because the Kindle version is so poorly formatted, the e-book deserves only 3 stars."
2,Disappointing,When I bought the DVD I was expecting more... All that I can find on the DVD is also possible to be found written in any book about stress. It doesn't make any sense if you sit and read this things to me. I wanted more... At least it had to be cheaper... Lots of web pages give these informations about stress for free...
2,Interesting but disapointed,"Although the information regarding the history and civil war in Sudan were helpful, the author had me confused several times by inconsistancies in name usages (ie: using first name in one sentence then using the surname in the next sentence. Also I was turned off by Emmas selfish attitudes regarding herself and images of who she thought African men are. ie; her statement regarding the male physical organ. It just validates the old stereotype describing African/African American men.Her primary goal in going to Africa was not to be an Aid worker, she was selfish in even that motivation."
2,Deceiving,I had thought that I was to read a story based on the biography of Emma McCune. Instead it seemed to me that I was reading an encyclopedia full of data but empty of feelings. I learnt a lot about Western politics on Africa but that was not what I was looking for when I started to read it.Emmanuel Jal is only mentioned in a short paragraph as an anecdote when he was actually a turning point in her life.Completely deceiving to me.
2,A Mediocre Attemp at a Review Book,"This review book is pathetic as far as mathematical content is concerned. Often, this book is so dumbed down that key shortcuts to certain mathematical concepts are completely OVERLOOKED. I'll admit, the practice problems and tests are helpful if one takes the time to do all of them (I didn't), but there is no excuse for such a lack of content. The book teaches the reader how to do everything the long way (often, there are much better methods). For example, in the polynomial division section, synthetic division was not even mentioned. Also, the fact that the permutation and combination functions are built into most calculators was not mentioned either. This can make testers take longer periods of time to complete their tests."
2,Below average book,"This book tends to over simplify the SAT II: Math test. There were not nearly enough practice questions, and the few practice questions they have are too easy. The actual test was more difficult than the question in this book. I used this book to review the simple concepts that I have forgotten over the years, but because I have a strong background in Math, I was able to score a 800 on the test. If you're not great at math, this book will not increase your scores too much."
3,What book is this,"I don't if any one else has noticed this or not but, all the reviews are for the Princeton Review for the Chemistry or Physics tests but the book being reviewed shouldbe the Princeton Review Math"
2,I'm torn: Good review but bad bad book,"This is a terribly written book. The grammer is poor, the exercises have conflicting answers (key conflicts with explanation), and the material is over simplified. However, I found that sitting down and doing hundreds of math problems really prepared me for the SAT II: Math. I scored an 800 on the IIc. Really."
1,Crap,"3 exercises on one page, so few examples, incomplete and misleading, plus the exams are old fashioned; I wish I never bought this book."
1,too simplified,This book merely covers the basic materials of SAT II Math IIC. Everybody almost knows the stuffs in the review sections. This book basically didn't help me.
4,easy purchase,"I had no issues for this item, I think I paid like 4 dollars for it and was very pleased."
4,Great 2nd round!!!,there are several good fights on this 2 discer and it does not disapoint. rampage and arona both wanted a shot at the belt and the fight did not let me down one bit. great event overall
5,Another classic,A classic event with every fight being highly entertaining. the main event features one of the most unbelievable momemnts you will ever see.
2,The Queen's Necklace,My bad. I was expecting a normal paperback but it turned out to look like a play script! I should have looked inside! Bought it as a gift but hesitated in giving it ! Will look inside next time!
4,"Great read, but dimension of book is cumbersome","I love the story itself being part of Dumas' ""The Marie Antoinette Romances"". The book however is like 8""x 11"" and with carpal tunnel, that makes it a little hard on my hands."
5,A Great Resource Book,"Fasa has vastly improved they way the write RPG/tabletop reference material. In years past, reading a unit sourcebook (i.e. Jade Falcon source book) was alot like reading a scrap book combined with a unit roster from the civil war. But their new works, the Field Manuals, really does a excellent job fleshing out units, their history and their culture, Providing a solid base for game masters to build awesome plots on. I recommend this book to ALL Battletech players and fans."
4,"As a long time Battletech fan, this is a must have","I've purchased all of the Feild Manual series so far in print and find the Comstar one to be a excellent addition. It offers insites into the indivudual units that make up Comstar, Word of Blake, etc. Though I would have liked to see more unit history and the re-formation of Clan Nova Cat."
1,useless,"I bought this book a week ago and from the time i have opened it and read it till now (a week after) it did not give me anything useful at all! The book is full of source code lines which are actually useless because they do not compile in the first place. Second, the code is commented very very badly.I would not suggest to anyone to buy this book. It IS A WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY!There are other much much better books out there for embedded programming."
4,Hero to Zero,Your on top of the world. Your a wealthy popular movie star...then the Devil bets God he can turn him from God when he takes away everything. A modern day biblacle story. This is a small book so its a very quick read. I thought this book was well written and interesting. I felt bad for the main character as he lost everything and was cheering through the end.
4,Good Baseball Biography!,This biography of Sal Maglie proved to be an interesting read. He started out a major leaguer with the team of the legendary Mel Ott.He bacame hated because of his tendency to throw knock-down pitches. After getting off to a major league start he found himself blacklisted for playing in the Mexican leagues.He was finally able to resume his major league baseball career at the age of 33.During his time as a major league baseball pitcherhe was able tp pitch in some world series games. One world series game he pitched in was the perfect game by Don Larsen.This is a good sports read. Buy it. You will find it to be very readable.
4,Very Nice Product.,I was very pleased with the product for three reasons. The seller's description was quite accurate. The reviews were also helpful and accurate. The seller's customer service was excellent in addition to shipping promptly. P.S. To all you prospective buyers: the weight is in fact hefty and the size is nice!
5,Brilliant!!,"I bought this book because it had excellent ratings and it does justice to its reputation. Bodo does a fantastic job of fleshing out the personality of each superstar, and the article on Religion in tennis is very different, to say the least...."
4,The forgotten world of 1970's tennis,It is hard to remember just what a freak show professional tennis was in the 1970's and into the 80's. The original bad boy of tennis - Ilie Nastase would spit at his opponents. A former man wanted to play as a woman. Jimmy Conners firing tennis balls next to lines people he disagreed with.And this book documents it all - all the major players and many of the ones who had their moment in the sun and slipped away into relative obscurity. The train wreck that Martina Navratilova put herself through with all her different partners. The real humanity beneath the Ice Queen media image of Chris Evert. The money train that Bjorn Borg simply walked away from after finally losing Wimbledon.I certainly enjoyed going back over so much of this history that has faded into the mists of time as today's tennis tour presents it's very professional and controlled stars today.
5,birthday present,"bought this for my father for his 50th birthday present. he had been reading to us from the original goop stories all my childhood, and I thought this might be a nice, small, nostalgic gift for him. he was touched."
3,Goethe The Poet And The Age Volume One,"If a person enjoys a scholarly biography with a lot of esoteric detail, this is a biography for him. However,If a person finds scholarly biographies tough going,he will be bored by this book."
2,Audi A8 floormats,The only issue I have with these floormats is that they are not compatible to the OEM grommet system. The grommets in these floormats are too large and do not snap onto the floor pegs that the OEM mats snap onto so they do not stay in place - they are not the same color as the carpet and are very black on a light colored carpet. I will use them in one position for a day or 2 to see if they can work out...
2,Not all that,"I read this book expecting a lot more from Margaret Atwood; all I hear about her is high praise.This book read like a boring diary. I think she intended it to be a allegory on loss of civil rights, esp for women but it's just boring."
5,I Thought I'd Never Find It Again!,"Many years ago my wife & I when to California after our children grew up and were on their own. We drove there pulling a trailer listening to our favorite music on tape cassettes. My favorite was the James Last Orchestra version of ""Music From Across The Way"" which I always dedicated to her. Unfortunately, the tapes were lost after she passed away 14 years ago and I could never recreate them again! I've search for this song everywhere without success until I finally found it on Amazon! Itwas the exact version we had and the CD has performed excellantly. I amforever gratefull to Amazon. Thank you very much!"
4,Music from Across the Way,"Let me confirm to an earlier post that the selection on this CD of ""Music From Across The Way"" is a vocal, choral version. It is NOT the instrumental version heard on numerous easy-listening stations in the past. Not a bad version though, just don;t understand why the instrumental version seems to be impossible to get. The rest of the selections are quite good."
2,The thinking mans Strawbs?,"Arcadium could be described an an obscure late sixties British folk/ progressive/ pychedelic/ rock band and this CD contains fifty three minutes of what can certainly be described as obscure British folk/ progressive/ pychedelic/ rock music.The music is light and tuneful and the production slick. It's nice to listen to but it all sounds alike, goes nowhere and never achieves anything other than sounding a lot like a lot of other bands of this time.The difference was that those other bands managed to put some emotion into their music.If you are into Kevin Ayers, Gong etc then you will no doubt be interested to listen to this but I cannot say that you will think that it was worth paying for the CD."
5,Amazing skin,"I apply lightly over freshly washed face to lock in moisture, then a spritz of Evian for additional moisture, and follow by moisturizer and/or makeup, night and day. Pores shrink, skin plumps, smooth complexion. Also evens tone, and may be responsible for calming capillaries. I have very fair and sensitive skin, and this product has become an absolute must. I don't experience any flaking whatsoever. Clear, healthy, youthful skin. I also supplement with Source Naturals Skin Essentials Hyaluronic Acid, Source Naturals Skin Eternal (very similar label), Pycnogenol, Omega 3-6-9 for healthy skin & more, but know this topical serum has a major positive effect on the appearance of my skin. Price significantly lower on Amazon than in health stores."
2,Not worth the price,I thought this would be the non-surgical answer to botox. I was wrong. it also peels off in little crumbs if you touch your face or want to apply make-up over it. I don't know too many women who don't wear at least powder foundation? I would not recommend.
3,I'm disappointed,"Don't get me wrong. Saranne Dawson has written some good books in the Romance/Fantasy sub-genre. The ideas are mostly original and intriguing. I've bought some of her books on the promise of the idea alone. This book though, just does not appeal to me. I'm 50% done and slugging through the rest. I'm a huge fan of the Romance and Fantasy genre, but for the romance to work, the reader has to care for the hero and heroine. To put it bluntly, if the enemy did them both in, I won't shed a tear. I give it a 3, because it did hold my interest for a while and the great cover. Ms Dawson can do much better than this."
4,Tough lock,"But the coating around the metal is not very thick. I hang them on my handle bar while I cycle and with every bump on the road, a scratch is made on the coating of the lock. But it's still a very sturdy lock. Recommend it."
4,Bang for the buck!,"This is a very good lock in this price range. The rubber shield on the outside prevents rust and the light on the key fob is useful at night. The only downside is the key. You must make sure to insert the key all the way before turning, otherwise you might bent the key."
4,Great U Lock,"This lock is a very nice lock for the price. It definitely was a little heavier than I expected but nothing that was a big issue. The lock I received partly yellow unlike the picture, but that is okay even though I would have preferred all black. I have not noticed any issues with the key and the lock as of yet. Will update if I have any issues with this lock as I continue to use it."
3,Lasts 9 months,"This is the second time I've bought this lock, and the second time that the key stops working completely after about 9 months. I hang the lock on my bike and the constant jostling slowly ruins the lock; it gets harder and harder to use the key until it just becomes impossible and the lock becomes useless."
3,"Get's the job done, don't trust the bracket","I got this lock almost a week ago in the mail. Firstly, it doesn't look much like the picture. It has a big gaudy yellow bar (not a big deal) and a bulky fixture to connect it to the included frame bracket (also no a big deal, it comes off). The frame bracket they include is worthless, the screw that connects the actual clip to the bracket snapped off the second time I tried using it. The lock itself works great, though it is a little big for my taste. With a faulty bracket, it's really a pain to carry it around unless I take a bag with me, which seems silly for just carrying a lock."
5,Quality with a difference,"Short story anthologies may be the easiest and best way to undertake a quick scan of the scale and varieties of our national literature. Still, most collections have not only the same authors but the same stories, over and over. Oates self-consciously set out to be a little different: she chooses many stories and a few authors who often do not get much ""air time."" Still, the selections are first rate even if not first run. Her introductions are good but a tad personal and very short so do not expect much biographic or historical context. In brief, if you already own one collection, this one will not be disappointing or redundant."
2,tough going,I thought I should boaden my reading so I bought this and I must say I cannot get through any of the stories. Just poor taste on my part I am sure. I just do not like the style of writing nor the depressing topics in some stories. I don't care for Hemmingway either.
2,TOO MANY SIMILAR STORIES,"One reviewer writes that one story he likes alone is worth the price of this book, and he's an English Lit teacher, of course.Well, we're in our 80s, living on fixed income; and if I had known that most, except for the ones from earlier times, are by, and about blacks.After a while the stories just get boring and are pretty much repetitive.I am sure some bigotted liberal will reply with how I am a redneck, and other crap. Without really reading what I say above."
2,Worked great for almost 48 hours.,"Easy to plug in, but less than 48 hours after installing, the headphone jack apparently broke free. Now you have to press the headphone plug to the side to get sound out of it. I will be looking into RMA'ing it after typing this review."
5,Exceptional Value,"Well made, from the case to the connectors.!!! Has more value than the actual cost. I am very pleased.D Atlas"
4,Photo is of older version (OnGuard recommends newer version),"The newer Bulldog MINI is distinguished by TWO yellow end caps and a different mounting bracket using a metal piece on the U-lock. Apart from the bracket, OnGuard claims the difference is mostly cosmetic, but OnGuard also indicates that the anti-theft insurance and guarantee terms differ between these versions. Moreover, OnGuard flatly states that the newer version of the Bulldog MINI is the one that should be purchased if this model is desired. If/when this seller distributes the new version, the photo should be changed. Note that the new Bulldog MINI list price is $35 list price, and that is the price for which it is sold at local recreational equipment stores. So paying that much (w/ shipping) for an older version might not be the best deal."
1,The lock profile stuck easily,"It's been only two weeks, the lock became stuck and I can't unlock it. This is the first time I buy a product from the brand, I'm really upset.<Update>The warranty department sent me a new one after one call. Thanks to that. I wish that it won't stuck easily like the last one."
3,Wow oh wow! what an over sized lock,Great lock if you were planing to lock your car or motorbike with or live in a place where it is comon to have your bike stolen. That lock is almost heaver then my bike and is so big it blocks me from space needed to put other things.IT really is a great lock if you have a use for it. If I had to gaurd my bike with that strong of a lock it would be better to just buy a couple of cheap bikes that no one would want to take. I have tried to give it away and no one wants that over sized thing.Waste of money..
1,Key is a joke,"I used this lock for less than a month and the key broke off inside the lock. I did not force the key, but simply turned it and it snapped off. I am not exaggerating! This lock is a joke!"
4,"Wonderful Lock, But 2 Minor Problems","I won't reiterate what everyone else has been saying about this lock. It's a really good and sturdy lock without the weight. But there are a couple of minor complaints that I have.Con:- The lock has two yellow covers on both ends of the lock, unlike the photo. This poses a problem because the yellow covers are plastic and tend to move around. This can lead to the cover of the holes becoming blocked and the lock cannot get in. But it is easy to move it back to the way it was, so not a big problem at all, just a minor one.- At you can see from the photo, the left side of the lock has an attachment on it that attaches to the bike. The problem with this is that the attachment slips off sometimes when the lock is unlocked. Although you can simply take the attachment off, that part of the lock is thinner than the rest of the lock, making it look weak.Overall, a very good lock, just those two minor problems."
4,Caution when you install it!,"I didn't read through the manual before my installation, and that's how the tragedy started..The lock holder uses a strap to fasten it to the seat tube. Pull the strap out of the slot, wrap it around your seat tube, and put it back to the slot again. Now you can fasten the bolt on the lock holder. DO NOT TOUCH the bolt before you have the strap wrapped around your seat tube, otherwise you will never get it out of there. This is like a one-time-use design."
2,mini lock does not like rain!,"I bought this so I would not have a heavy lock to carry on my commuter bike.It does not like rain. I had trouble unlocking and had water trapped in it for a few days after. The key was not that sturdy. Maybe it is the brand. My other locks are the other brand, no problem"
2,Disappointing. Mostly good thoughts in scatterbrained format that is outdone by competing books.,"I find the publishing style in this very old-fashioned, boring, and just not very professional by today's standards. Some of the content is good, but the format becomes annoying. Not many true secrets here either, just well-known best practices. You could do worse, but you can definitely do better with another book."
2,Common sense,"Most every page in this book is just one paragraph with the rest of the page being taken up by blank lines for your ""notes"". The information they give you is common sense stuff that anyone with half a brain would do when trying to locate somebody. There is a little bit of useful information in the back, which is the only reason this book gets 2 stars. My advise, don't waste your money on this one."
4,Sil Austin Best Selection,I am pleased to find this music. It was difficult to find in 1963. That it is available in 2007 is impressive.
5,Great Sax Player,I was so happy to find a cd of an Artist I remembeed from the early 70sor late 60s. His version of Danny Boy reaches right into your very soul.
3,Love Sil Austin,Brings back memories but it is a little scratchy. Wish they would digitize Sil Austin Plays Pretty for the People.
5,Outstanding pruners,"I work in a vineyard for a living, and these are the pruners I choose to use every day. The ergonomic handle is outstanding and the quality of the pruners is wonderful. I've used a lot of pruners over the years, but I suspect this will be the last pair I ever buy."
3,Too Large for smaller hands to use rotating handles,"Maybe if my hands were larger this would work as I swear by Bahco pruners, very disappointing. Will just use the regular handled ones"
5,best pruners,"These pruners cut through branches like butter. I wish I had got these years ago. My hands are arthritic and get real sore quickly with other brands of pruners. I had tried ratcheting pruners before [said to be good for arthritic hands], and was not happy with the way they cut. These pruners are easy on the hands and cut clean. Worth the money!"
1,Cheap item expensive price,"I bought this item thinking black screws would look cool on a black car. As I screwed them in, the first one snapped and now it can't be extracted. Save your money, stick with metal."
4,"Not as good as the original,. but still a fun book to read","The only problem I have with this book, is that is has been done before. And fairly recently. The obvious connections between this book and S. M. Stirlings ""Island In The Sea Of Time"" series is more then obvious. A section of modern America is thrown backwards in time. They then use (or recreate) more modern technology to help fight the local bad guys. There are some things that are interesting in this book though. They actually give a cause for the time displacement (a kind of silly one, but it is fun to read). While it is very obviously influenced by S.M. Stirling, the story does have it's own feel. It is different enough that I still enjoyed it. And I will probably read any sequels that might follow. While not up to the level of Harry Turtledove and S.M. Stirling, Mr. Flint does have a lot of promise. I hope that his future books work more on originality, because he very obviously has it."
2,Wish someone else had written this,"Flint has a pretty good idea (albeit not a new one), but his writing isn't up to the job. And there are a few holes: the first thing most people would worry about after a disaster is the supply of drinking water...He tends to rely heavily on some phrases-- I got awfully tired of reading about 'whimsical thoughts'. Where's the man's editor?"
5,Hey I enjoyed this one!,"Just a good old plain fun book! Yeah, some people might call it fluff, but it was good fluff. Not to heavy on the background history, just enough to let the reader know whats going on and why. This is the type of A.H. book I like, when I as the reader can hook into the characters, because their just plain old folks like you and I. Not some far fetched hero I can't picture, but folks. It this case Americans! A bunch of gun toting ones at that! Plop a whole town from modern day West Viginia in the middle of the Thirty Years War and see what happens, first a lot of heavy handed justice that's for sure, then we have to save the Princess, then we let everyone know that we will not be messed with, no sir! Cause we are by God Americans! I would very much like to see Mr. Flint write another story, a sequal (don't ya just hate that word), I would like to see where and how far this story line could go. I mean come on we aren't gonna let Richelieu get away with what he did are we?"
4,A good read,"Eric Flint is an experienced writer and did his usual good job on plot, character development, and description. The 'modern humans transported to the historical past' is a tried and true form of science fantasy; if I had not read several of this genera I would have liked it more--but I found myself thinking (Ok, it's time for thus and thus to happen), and sure enough, it did. So, if you have not read much of this genera--do this series....it is well worth reading."
5,Optimistic and Fun,"Not much I can add to previous reviews, except that ""1632"" is my kind of book for a fun read. It has the feel of an old-fashioned space opera, with a large cast of heroic characters who, when flung into the past, bring modern American ideals to the 17th Century. OK, it's not too realistic. These people behave as we wish people would behave. They're the kind of people we'd like to be. And merely the introduction of democracy causes bigotry to disappear (sadly, we all know that doesn't happen). But you can read the news if you want a realistic portrayal of religious fanaticism. This is just pure entertainment, with an optimistic and idealized outlook. If you're looking for grim realism, pass it by. And it's not great literature. But it's fun and it's one of those books I'll reread whenever I need a morale boost."
3,I would rather have it the other way around!,"A cosmic disaster transports an entire American mining town into 17th century Imperial Germany of a parallel universe. The teutonic hordes armed with saber, pike and cannon are soon disbanded, and whereas a millenium earlier Rome had brought civilization and underground sanitation to Germany, blue-collar America tries to establish the 'Novus Ordo Seclorum' called America on German soil... more than a hundred years ahead of schedule. Throughout the book, Germans are depicted as nekulturny savages, uneducated belligerents without a clue and seriously outgunned. I would have rather sent the 37th SS-Panzerdivision to bring law and order to a riotous and civil war ridden America of the 21st century."
1,A hack potboiler,"It could have been fun reading if it were written better, but it's horrible, really. From the beginning, the Americans gleefully slaughter medieval bad guys while spewing out jingoistic garbage. These Americans make The Terminator look like a diplomat. This is not for fans of fantasy or even sci-fi; but given its graphic and gratuitous violence, maybe for fans of horror."
1,Bad Book,The idea behind the book - time displacement - is unique and creative. But the way the book was written leaves something to be desired.Blood thirsty vigilantism is justified in this book.I wonder if the ... financed this book.In brief horrible book.
2,Brutal!,"Disclaimer: I couldn't finish this book, so this may not be a completely fair review. That said, I have to say that this is one of the worst books I've read in a long time. There are no real characters, just caricatures. The mine workers/town folks are heroic, pure blooded, sound Americans, and almost everyone else is shady or evil. The blessed Americans will save the world from evil!"
4,Wonderful Story! Great Fun to Read!,"When it comes to silly premises ""1632"" can't seem much sillier. A small West Virginian town is transported back in time and dropped into 17th century Germany. The funny things is it works. Once you get past the impossible the story really works! How would 21st century man function in pre-Napoleon Europe? Is technology enough to overcome war, death and pestilence? This sure gives a reasonable account on what happens when two such disparate worlds collide.The characters presented are well rounded deep and a joy to follow. The love stories intertwined throughout the book are wonderful, especially the romance of one steel-minded camp follower and a geeky boy from the future.A thoroughly enjoyable blend of history, fantasy, action and romance it is one of the most enjoyable books I have read in a long time. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND ""1632"""
4,Good Hokey Fun,"This should have been a crappy book. But its not. The author does a good job of making his characters ""real"". There is no ""fish out of the water"" crap on the side of the Germans, or on the side of the Americans. It is one of the few books that has made me laugh aloud. It earned four stars on the basis of the humor, but it didn't get five stars because Eric Flynn just isn't that great of a writer."
4,"willing suspension of disbelief, to a point","ok, i can accept that a west virginia town gets miraculously transported to 1632 and the technological adjustments the transportees make are interesting, even clever. But would the townspeople really offer so little opposition to the group that takes control of the town? there are 1 or 2 'bad guys' among the citizens, but i find it very hard to believe that there wouldn't be more unrest and sabotage. i kept waiting for something really bad to happen and was disappointed. actually, i was relieved. i liked these people. i wanted them to succeed. the history was interesting and the real characters were lots of fun. on the whole i enjoyed this book and look forward to the next."
2,I feel like this was written for 13 year olds,"Forgive me for reviewing this prematurely (I'm only a couple hundred pages in) but I can't help but feel like this book was written as either a ""First fantasy"" or a ""alternative fantasy for people who don't want their kids reading fantasy because it's nothing but make believe"". I can tell that the author did his research regarding the 30 years war, and while the struggles the ""settlers"" face are fleshed out quite believably the characters themselves are cliches. Maybe that was what Flint was trying to do, test our way of life against cultures of the past to see how they would react against each other, using stereotypical blue-collar workers as his lab rats, but if that's then this reader still can't help but find the book (and it's characters) unattractive. I'm going to finish it because I bought it at a friends suggestion, but this will be the last book of Flint's that I read."
3,He Does Better with Drake,"I loved Flint's books about Belisarius with David Drake, so I rushed out and bought 1632 in hardcover. Don't. Wait for the paperback. 1632 is good, but not in the same league as the Belisarius books. I guess David Drake was really bringing something to the table, besides just his name.Don't get me wrong, 1632 is a good romp, but it's not worth hard cover prices."
2,1632--Or how a trilogy seemed to be compressed into one book,"Mr. Flint took a great idea and didn't run with it. It seemed to me that this book would have been better if it was stretched out into a trilogy, or more, along the lines of Forstchen's ""Lost Regiment"" series. Every thing in 1632 seemed to happen way to fast. The UMWA conquered army after army, won the girl and created a society faster then anything Superman could have done. Within a matter of months or even days these W. Virginians ""conqured"" almost all of Europe. It would have been a more interesting book if there was more overall danger and the town didn't seem to overcome every disaster in a blink of an eye."
4,It took me away from Farmville for a day,"I am a fan of the CONNECTICUT YANKEE IN KING ARTHUR'S COURT type of books so I knew going in that I would like this book. The plot flows well and the characters are all believable.I have a few minor quibbles that kept me from rating this five stars:1. Too much time was spent describing an historic battle. I don't care and would have preferred a one page summary, I am not a fan of strategic war games.2. At no time during the book does it refer to anyone going around and picking up the spent cartridges. That bothered my frugal soul.3. A nursing mother would not have stayed away from her baby for over 24 hours no matter how great the sex. ;)"
3,Most single towns would fail in 1632,"This period of history is not one I'm familar with, but I just readMother Courage and Her Children: Adapted By David Harewhich takes place at that time. This sci fi is an exciting and well written tale, but somewhat bloody. It takes a lot of technology to make an M16or a modern tank. The ebb and flow of Europe at this time was very bloodyand things were just about to change forever as science and mathematics combined for the start of new technology, but the guns were poorand the tactics pretty basic. I think an American town would have lasted about a week..."
5,A great alternate history novel,"If you're like me, you like reading for the escape, and 1632 by Eric Flint, flaws notwithstanding, takes the reader on a strange story of timeshift and alternate history. The town of Grantville, Virginia falls victim to an Assiti Shard, aka the Ring of Fire, and is transported back to 1632, right in the middle of Germania and the 30 Years War. Eric Flint writes good characters, and although some of the logistical issues that would arise are never adequately addressed, he spins an interesting tale. I'd recommend this to anyone curious about reading alternate history and sci-fi in general."
4,Great Story!,"1632 Is a great story, my only negative comment is that there are a few unnecessary sex scenes and language that will definitely take this one out of the hands of children, otherwise this book could also have been used to inspire a younger generation into reading. Not only that but the one descriptive sex scene was not necessary and language also I think could have been refined a little between the main characters. One more thing although it does not take away from this novel, it makes the story more believable when a main character gets killed off... again another novel where the author is afraid to kill off a beloved and invested in character.Aside from that I look forward to reading the next one in series."
5,"This one is on my ""Keeper"" shelf!","I saw this book, with it's wretched cover art, on bookstore shelves for years before my spouse picked up a copy and I started reading it.I will admit that history was not a primary interest of mine in school, probably because I never had a teacher whom I felt cared enough to create any interest in anything other than memorizing dry facts - torture, at best. I have to admit that two books started wholesale research efforts on my part which ended up costing me a lot to obtain history books on their subjects: Sunne in Splendor by Sharon Kay Penman for histories of the Wars of the Roses and Richard the Third, and this one for histories of the hundred Years War and Gustavus Adolphus, Count Tilly, and Wallenstein.Loved this book. Ignore the cover art (which appears to be aimed an teenage gamers), and just read the darn thing."
2,Buy it used,"IF you like time-travel/alternativish history more than you dislike reaaaaaaaaaaly bad writing, then buy this book. But do yourself a favor, buy it used. This book reads as if it was written by a high school senior, so cardboardish and predictable is everything about it. Stirling's ""Island in the Sea of Time,"" etc, are better reads since Stirling is generally a better writer than Flint.Frankly, after reading about 200 pages, I gave up on it and skipped to the end. Nicely set up for, guess what, 1633. I realize why I gave up on the Belisarius books by Flint and Drake: too much Flint and not enough Drake."
2,Wishful thinking on a grand scale,"While Mr. Flint obviously has done a considerable amount of research on 17th-century Europe, which at least makes the book informative, his style of writing is more suited for that used in comic books. The plot is shallow, controversy is minimal, and the protagonist characters are so much more superior than their ""evil"" enemies, the outcome of their struggle does not produce even a shadow of a doubt. The author attempted to pluck at the patriotic strings of his readers by having a small group of people from a coal-mining community strive to build the new United States inside war-ravaged Europe, and for some it obviously works - patriotism is a powerful driving force, just look at the success of the movie ""Independence Day."" However, even this cannot compensate for sugary-plain romance between a number of couples in the story, one-sided battle scenes, and single-minded thought process of the book's characters."
2,Disapointing effort,"Having read excellent examples of this genre (e.g. S.M Sterling's Ocean in the Sea of Time), I found this book to be very disappointing. The writing and plot construction is poor, especially in an author who has several novels under his belt. My main complaint is simply that everything is way too easy for the 'up-timers.' The main character faces little opposition personally, romantically, politically, or internationally. Every battle is won easily. There is no suspense and little interest.I read this book because one of my favorite authors, David Weber, co-authored the sequel. I am sad to say that even Weber can't save this series.Read S.M Stirling's work instead, you'll find it much more rewarding."
5,Engaging!,A unique story premise. The characters are strong and well written. There were times I laughed out loud and found myself unable to put it down. One of the best books I've read in years even though I tended to just scan over the battle scenes to get back to the characters I came to adore. I would LOVE to see this as a mini-series or motion picture!
3,A work in the making....,"I passed this book up for over a year; finally reading it last month. Yes, it is another alternative history story and not one of the best. 1632 is not one of the worse either. It has action, moves along nicely and the characters are interesting. There is also just enough sex to be fun without being a bore. But wait! Don't pass this book up because I only gave it three stars. 1632 is the lead off into what I feel will be a marvelous series. David Weber worked with Mr. Flint to produce 1633 which is a great sequel. I am now waiting for 1634. Go for it......"
3,I Could Have Loved This Book,"The only thing that I found wrong about this book is that it was too short. I would have loved to have read a more richly developed description of the seventeenth century characters' response to twentieth century technology. It was difficult for me to believe that people of that era would blithely accept all of the 20th century inventions without giving it more thought. I know I still am frequently amazed that a 747 can fly in the air.I would think that automated vehicles, televion, telephones, etc. would take quite a bit of getting used to.I guess this is a situation of too little of a good thing."
1,Utter Garbage,1632 is a very poorly researched speculative history. Historical figures wear white and black hats with very little grey. Events happen to perfectly support the interests of the protagonists. Please do not waste your time reading this lousy book. Please read Harry Turtledove or S.M. Stirling who write good books.
2,Wait for Paperback!,"While this book was ""OK"", it's not even in the league of S.M. Sterling's ""Against the Tide of Time""... Sometimes the internal logic of the novel colapses. sometimes, it's just absurd."
3,Directed Verdict,"Well written, characters interesting. A great twist that was not revealed until the end. Wanted more spiritual emphasis woven into the story."
4,Directed Verdict,Good legal read. Kept my interest and did not have technical or typo errors (that I saw). Will look for this author again.
3,Solid thriller,"While this was a good story and had very entertaining scenes with the legal drama elements of the novel, I had trouble believing certain elements. First, the Saudis were portrayed as such deeply immoral people, even as they adhere to the strictures of their beliefs their religious police say they are upholding. Second, the protagonists were so goody-goody that I found them hard to believe. It was almost a morality play.Yet, good legal drama and awareness of the maneuverings in the courtroom and in the dealings between the lawyers. This is worthy but not the best out there."
1,Uck!!,I only got into this book a little. It grossed me out. The torture and then the court scene where the defending attorney was describing procedures; these things grossed me out and I had to put book down. Will not pick it up again.
5,Directed Verdict,"More twists, and turns than a pretzel factory during the holidays. It is one of those books that will anger you only because it is suddenly two thirty in the morning, and still can't put it down ( this from experience ). The deeper into the book the harder it is to set down. Don't miss this one"
5,WOW! AMAZING READ!!!,"I loved this book from the start. I couldn't put it down. First, there are so many twists and unexpected turns (and some expected turns that turn into unexpected turns) that it was practically impossible to determine what the outcome would be. I knew what I WANTED the outcome to be but honestly wasn't sure that was going to happen.I have always liked John Grisham novels (and Dan Brown) so when I saw this I was hoping for a good suspense novel and Mr. Singer definitely delivered. I loved Sarah's character from the start. To have that kind of peace in your heart even under extreme distress is amazing and having witnessed people like that in my own life I felt I could identify with her.I felt that the characters were well developed and although occasionally I did get confused with who was who, I blame that on my wanting to read faster vice any fault of the author. Would definitely recommend this to others (and already have) and would read it again."
5,Directed Verdict: A Novel,"If you like suspenseful, complicated plots, this book is for you.Although much of the story is set in Tidewater, Virginia, Singer takes the reader into the closed society of Saudi Arabia. The diverse, colorful characters keep the story alive, while the tortuous plot keeps the reader riveted. I hope the author publishes again soon."
2,Wrong product,I ordered the 8.5 oz bottle of Bain de terre rinse and shine white willow volumizing foam however I received a 6.7 oz bottle of Bain de terre rise and shine volumizing foam. The product sent to me did not have the white willow in it. I like the one that was sent though too.
1,A Trivial review of the 20th Century,"I read the whole series of 12 beacause it was one of the New York Times list of 100 greatest novels of the 20th Century.I found the whole series to be unfunny and trivial considering they covered a very significant era of History. Over 3000 pages of narration by Nick Jenkins and by the end of the series the reader has little insight into who Nick really is. The characters are a bunch of odd-ball hanger-ons who,though intellectually stimulating, seem shallow and indiscreet."
2,Tribute??,"I am more than a little confused about this one. I thought tributes were either done posthumously or after a long and successful career. Ruben is very talented, but since he is living and is just starting his career.....The artists on this CD are among the more talented American Idol participants. However, why was it released under the guise of a ""tribute?"" It was just another way to quickly release Idol cuts and earn some fast money.I don't see much of a reason to buy this one."
1,A TRIBUTE?!,"Why in the world was a tribute to Ruben made? I don't like these Tribute CDs, they are sung by not-so-talented studio session singers. Avoid at all costs!"
1,wrong product ordered and could not cancel,"I orded the Van Halen CD which was in Japaneese by mistake. It said I could cancel at anytime, so when I reviewed my purchase and seen it was wrong I tried to cancel it and was told I couldn't cancel. I wanted to order the vinyl album. When the CD arrived it had a return slip with it. I haven't had time to return it yet, but it is a hassel for me. Amazon should not say you can cancel at anytime and then not let you.Very unsatisified,Ronda Glazier"
5,"Needless to say, this album is one of the best out there.","While it may not have as good guitar work as VH1 from 1978, this album has the same quality of song writing which is proven when one considers the fact that they can hear practically every song from VH1 and this album on any good classic rock station. Songs like ""Panama"", ""Hot For Teacher"", ""I'll Wait"", and the classic ""Jump"" all became classics on the radio and made Van Halen even larger than they were after their 78 debut that launched their careers. The only down side to this album is the fact that it was Diamond Dave's last with the band before Sammy Hagar took over. Don't get me wrong, I like Hagar for his solo and Van Halen songs, but the band just wasn't the same without their original frontman. Never the less, this album is a must have for any fan of good classic rock or fun metal."
4,One of VH's best...,"and, besides the first disc, defintely the best of the DLR-era (yeah, I admit, I like Sammy better as their singer. But not by much). Almost every track is strong here. ""Jump"" is self-explanatory, a song that will be popular 40 years from now. ""Panama"" and ""Drop Dead Legs"" are almost as good. A few surprises pop up; the aforementioned ""Jump"" and ""I'll Wait"", which add keyboards to the Eddie repetoire, but are both great tunes, the latter being surprisingly powerful. And ""House of Pain"" has a typically awesome hard rock riff. If you're new to VH, this should be one of the first albums you get (like I did)."
3,It was the best of times and time to JUMP,"Although a few of the tunes were good and hits at the time, this has not aged well. The only exceptions being the three tracks Top Jimmy, Drop Dead Legs and House of Pain which resemble those old VH albums which we had come to love. Hot For Teacher was the only hit that had the balls of the earlier work.As for the MTV thing, I lived through it all and the videos were excellent. I think even I'll Wait had a video. Jump, Panama (Reach down between my legs)...Hot For Teacher (with her on the desks). Class Dismissed. This was the old VH. David Lee Roth really shined. Move over and let Sammy take over. End of story.(I hear you missed us...we're back!)Yes, David. We missed you. Still do."
4,Van Halen - '1984' (Warner Bros.),"Review no.178.Originally hit the streets right after New Year's Day 1984.This was,of course the band's sixth and final(duh!)record with Diamond Dave.I've always dug this album.My only gripe is that the lp opener ""1984/Jump"" is,always HAS been and will likely continue to be over-rated and over-played.The rest of this disc is fine,basically just well written and well-produced '80's hard rock.I'll take cuts like the rocking ""Panama"",""Drop Dead Legs"",the *ss-kicking ""Hot For Teacher""(still like catching this video on VH1 Classic)and ""Girls Gone Bad"" any day.Heard the DLR is supposed to reunite with Eddy,Alex and Michael before too long here.Let's hope it really happens this time.A should-have."
5,David Lee Roth's last VH album,"Don't get me wrong, I like Sammy Hagar, but DLR (IMO) was the voice of Van Halen and 1984 was the end of their best albums. 1984 is fantastic. Not a bad cut on it. It ranks just behind their debut for the percentage of good songs it has. ""Jump"", ""Panama"", ""Drop Dead Legs"" and ""Hot For Teacher"" just to name a few. One of metal's top '80s groups had reached it's pennacle. The group didn't crash but suffered a slow burn out after this album."
5,Going out in style!,"In my opinion, Van Halen's best! It's a true masterpiece. Upbeat and uplifting. The ultimate party album!"
4,"What's there to say, it's Van Halen",Had a little problem downloading it but Amazon solved the problem. Most people who get this album know what's on it already.
5,Great rock-n-roll,"Yes, I realize the Sammy Hagar is a better musician and song-writer than David Lee Roth but still--I love the old Van Halen. 1984 is their best album, pre- or post DLR. Every track is either good or great. Ironically, ""Jump,"" the most well-know track, is probably the least interesting. I think every kind who picks up a guitar learns the riff for ""Panama"" (or, at least, they used to). Just great rock-and-roll."
4,Roth's last Hurrah,"Van Halen was innovative with the use of keyboards on this CD. 1984 is a unique instrumental opening, which leads into the keyboard-driven ""Jump."" This clearly one of their best-known songs. Some other well-known tracks on here are Panama and Hot For Teacher.This was the last CD before the great divorce (when frontman David Lee Roth parted from the rest of the band). Neither were quite the same after they went separate ways. VH did better than Roth in the time that followed, but time showed us that David Lee Roth and Van Halen were better together. Every so often, talk of them reuniting comes out from the media. Maybe someday it will be so."
3,Not as lazy as Diver Down but not a fitting end to Roth,"DLR unjustly took the blame for all the synths on 1984 but that was actually Eddie's idea. This album does have some great rock on it (Panama, Hot for Teacher, Girl Gone Bad, House of Pain) and one of their most intriguing songs (I'll Wait). 1984 shows a band artistically and physically on the divide. In one camp you had Roth trying to keep the party going even at the cost of lackluster music (Top Jimmy, Drop Dead Legs)while in the other camp you had Eddie trying to write more experimental music but blunting the band's hard rock edge (1984, Jump). Well, you know how that story turned out...they agreed to disagree and everybody lost. Another bummer, this album is another VH opus that is the length of a sitcom. C'mon Ed, let's have a complete remastered boxed set of Roth era VH."
4,3 and 1/2 stars,"The best material here is among VH's best but the CD is not as uniformly entertaining as Diver Down and VH II. Eddie's playing is incendiary as always but sometimes it sounds more like a technical exercise than one in joyous music making. David Lee sounds like he's having a great time, but ""Top Jimmy"" moves dangerously close to caricature. ""I'll Wait"" was a big hit but, in retrospect, sounds like a premonition of the style VH adopted when Sammy Hagar took over as singer. Not saying that's good or bad, take it at face value.Of course I knew the hits that make up half this CD very well and so, no doubt, do you. But my recent purchase of this CD is the first time I heard all the other songs. I can't really put my finger on it but I just don't get the same kick with this as I did with the earlier DLR-era discs. And, with VH, the kick is what it was all about."
5,Van Halen's most popular and rightly so,"Van Halen rule, and 1984 shows them in fine style. Every song is cool and it's more varied than their other albums with a quasi-ballad in 'I'll Wait' and this albums usthers in some swirly keyboard effects. This contains the all time classics 'Jump' and 'Panama' which are just amazing. One of Van Halen's Best. Buy this first as well as 'Van Halen 1' if you want to get into them. Fantastic album."
4,CD should not be played in a Red Car.,"The guitar riffs and all-out motion in the drums in ""Hot For Teacher"" are incredible. Pop this CD track in your car stereo and you're begging for at least 3 new points on your auto insurance.The rest of the album is cool, owing mostly to heavy guitar riffs (Panama), light but cool guitar riffs (Top Jimmy), one 80's style, pre-Journey rock ballad (I'll wait), a mild headbanger (House of Pain), and the KOSS-powered ""Jump."" By the way, ""1984"" is really just the synthesized-effects intro to that song.The really cool thing about this album is that you realize the value of a cool (and crazy) singer. These tracks would not be the same without DLRoth. That guy could make a history lecture sound like a rock festival."
5,Van Halen final album!!!,"It's 15 years old and it still rocks.PANAMA,DROP DEAD LEGS,HOT FOR TEACHER,TOP JIMMY...the band were at their peak then,what a pity Diamond Dave left and that tool Hagar joined!Since then ,some has-been from poodle rockers Extreme has joined and the once mighty VH have been reduced to a pub rock band...RIP VH 1978-84"
3,These Guys Have Done Better,"Don't get me wrong. This is not a bad recording by any means. Hot For Teacher, Jump, I'll Wait, Panama, and Top Jimmy are all very good songs. However five good songs do not a classic album make. The remaining tracks more or less sound like they were used to complete this disc. There are some interesting moments but as a whole they bring this recording down to an ordinary level."
2,prices crazy,how can a cd that is over 10 years old still be 11.00 save a whole $.48 wow wow no thanks
2,Not that good,"2 stars for the solo in Jump, the riff in Panama and the tapping at the start of Hot for Teacher. The rest of the album sucks."
1,JUMP.......AWAY FROM THIS!!!,"Keyboard's and VanHalen? I guess it was time for Dave to leave. ""JUMP"" has got to be one of the worst song's ever. Just because it sold alot, it dosent mean that it's good."
1,Ain't got nothin' on Leppard,"Leppard's ""Pyromania,"" ""High 'N' Dry"" and ""On Through the Night"" albums rip Van Halen's ""1984"" to shreds, and everyone knows it, too. It's a well-known fact by now that Eddie Van Halen and the boys were scared of Def Leppard in the early '80s - many bands were. Though Leppard would go on to create shlock themselves, ""1984"" is quite underwhelming when paired against Leppard's ""Pyromania"" record.Face facts, Halen were pretty average, save for Ed's searing guitar."
1,The wizzerrrzt rawwk band evuh! And I seen dem all!,"And u thought Zep, Sabbath, Beatles, Floyd & all those uuther pozzzer bandz were bad. DIS IS TEH WORST!!!!!!! This band has the wizzerst guitar playa eva!!! 0 starz! Oh, enad that coover, its terrizble! A bizzaby smooking! Completely noooooot toooolabrale!!!!!! Luckizzaly dey bizzacame GOOD wit dat noooooooo sieeeennngger on Ven Heelaen 3! Bizzzzay dat & avooooid des at ALL costz!GIZZIT GC & VIZZAN HALEN 3 INSTEAD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,Diamond Dave quits while he's ahead,"Dave writes his best songs here and leaves the group while on top of his game. In retrospect, it was a smart move for everyone involved.Contains the then 7 year old ""House Of Pain"" recorded for their first album and included here as a bonus for the fans."
4,anything with roth is good,Hey anybody know's real van halen is with roth and nobody else...oh and to the fool 2 spaces down life's rich pagent was in 86 not 84.
5,legendary,good older music. this seems to be a famous van halen picture. i am really that i bought this CD.
4,The last of the great ones.,"The last great VH album before the dawn of Van Hagar. Avoids descending into techno-rock and remains one of the best mid-80's rock albums and certainly the highlight of the VH output. The tasteless cover art is guaranteed to offend someone, which is always a plus in this genre."
2,Not for me,"If you've never seen any Indian films, it takes some getting used to. A scene will be going on like normal and then the characters burst into song! I had seen Bride and Prejudice, also with Aishwarya Rai, before this, but that was made for a Western audience so it was easier to watch.I wasn't crazy about this movie, honestly. I liked some of the scenes wit Meenakshi and Captain Bala (Marianne and Colonel Brandon) the best, actually. And there were funny parts. But I felt it took too long to get started (it's over 2 hours long) and then rushed everything in at the end. I got so bored trying to rewatch it for the review that I skipped over the musical numbers. I guess I'm just not the right audience for this."
2,I Wish I Hadn't Found It,"This film is a lumbering disappointment. While some of the Tamil dance numbers were intriguing,they were soon followed by two of the goofiest vocal numbers: one involved a wealthy young financier floating down the river on a raft,for no particular reason, while serenading a rainstorm; this same character - he does get around - is later seen, clad in a cape, at some fantasy castle with his love ""Ash"". She, you, and I would have been better served if he had earlier drowned in the river. The entire film could have used some careful editing, starting with the opening military sequence, which really served no purpose. I'd recommend, instead the 1995 Sense and Sensiblity, or, if you want two good Indian films, watch Lagaan or Fanaa."
3,I Have Found It,"I enjoyed the musical numbers in this Eastern Indian production, however I was disappointed that it was subtitled and not dubbed."
1,be careful of old DVD's from other countries,"This DVD is NOT COMPATABLE with DVD Players in AUSTRALIA. I have tried on 4 different DVD Players.However, the postage is so high that it's pointless sending it back since the refund will just about equal the postage you pay to send it!"
1,Never Again!,"Not being a true Bollywood fan, I deeply regret having bought ""I have found it."" It may be for some, but the whole genre and presentation of the movie were appalling. I was simply unable to watch through the entire movie. The story line, supposedly based on one of Jane Austen's novels, had much potential. That was my reason for buying the DVD. Unfortunately, the director of this movie simply butchered it. There's no question it was one of my worst movie-vewing experiences."
3,Lovely adaptation of Sense and Sensibility,"I don't watch a lot of Bollywood musicals, but I was intrigued by the premise of this one: loosely based on Jane Austen's Sense and Sensibility, and set in modern-day India, it follows the story of two sisters and the men who court them. Since I am a big Jane Austen fan, I simply had to see how this was done, and I am very glad I took a chance on this marvelous film.Beautiful costumes, great song-and-dance numbers and some gorgeous scenery--one scene appears to be shot in Egypt at the Pyramids, another at a Scottish castle. My only problem with the film is the hilariously bad subtitles, which start lagging about 30 seconds behind the action on screen around halfway through the film. I had to give up on them about three quarters of the way through the movie, but the story was easy to follow, and I didn't feel lost.Overall, an excellent film, and highly recommended.Edited to add that I should have rated the film 4 stars instead of just 3."
5,Sense and Sensibility in India,Austen meets Bollywood.Really a charming movieAt first I found the singing off putting but ultimately found it endearing.
4,Jane Austin in any language is great,This treatment of Jane Austin's Sense & Sensibility was very well done. My only critique is some of the characters were not well defined when introduced and it takes a while to figure out how they fit the plot. The music is underplayed and the story takes the main stage unlike most Bollywood productions. The slightly out of sync couples and the turns of events keep you wondering to the last how it could ever work out to a happy ending. As the title states they find it in the end. Will watch this movie again and again and enjoy it equally each time.
4,Bollywood here I come.,"Another wonderful Bollywood flick, with cheesy actors and colorful, vibrant dancing scenes. It never ceases to amaze me how beautiful Aishwarya Rai is in any of her films. I love this film. It brings a quality to the cinema that Americans have not been able to do."
4,Rear Window looks back,"Jorge Furtado's comedies are some of the most popular films currently in Brazil, for good reason. Some US critics of The Man Who Copied fault it for petering out, for not developing the implications of the limited options of the working class, ie, the copy ""boy"" who got kicked out of school. But the movie has more surprising twists in store, which without being too much of a spoiler I can only call ""Rear Window"" looks back."
3,Flat and characterless narration,"Although Narasimhan has done a proficient enough job in this translation - his English is certainly much better than most full length translations currently available -- it is nevertheless a rather dry version of the great epic. If you are new to the text this will be heavy going, IMO, and you will probably soon find yourself lost in the morass of characters and their complicated relationships. He has not done much to help the reader make sense of the whole thing, unlike some other introductory versions, such as that by Krishna Dharma. It is a page turner only in the sense that you will be constantly turning backwards to remind yourself what is going on. But three stars anyway, as it is after all a faithful version of this wonderful work."
4,as advertised,Shows reliable holding power. Withstood 11 ton vessel in 35 knot winds. Dries up rapidly when soaked. Allows minimal stretch. Recommend shafing protection around pilings.
5,Comfort Food,I purchased this edition in 1972 and used it until the pages stuck together and the binding disintegrated. This is the ultimate in comfort food cookery.I will be purchasing two more for my kids.
1,GARBAGE,"When this product works it is very useful. The swinging motion quiets our baby right down and often puts him to sleep. However, we have gone through two swings already. Both had problems with the motor. Replacement of the first swing took over a month, which is a long time to be without this type of swing. We are now awaiting shipment of our third swing. Lots of sleepless nights as a result. Customer Service is not helpfull or understanding. The good thing is that I am an expert at puting these swings together now if anyone needs a hand."
1,Disappointed,"I love Bryan Bowers but this DVD was a disappointment. I play several instruments and am good about figuring things out on my own but now with this DVD. He just plays really really fast and doesnt explain how to play it. He doesn't even tell you the chords or key he is playing in. Get ""Beginning Autoharp"" by Evo Bluesteing instead. It is a good beginners DVD."
5,"Just simple, awesome punk!","After listening to this album for the first time all the way through, I was in shock. I had never expected in wildest dreams for Home Grown to be as good as they are. The fact is, that they are that good. Every song on Act Your Age has this certain yet unique character to it that only Bob Herco can provide. With the likes of John, Ian (since thrown out of the band), and Adumb, Bob is able to characterize each song with emotional lining and still be able to make it song young and punk. That is a true musical talent at its peak! So many songs go through my head when anyone mentions Act Your Age, but the ones that really stick out are: ""Bad News Blair,"" ""She's Anti"", ""Surfer Girl"", ""Reflections,"" ""Grow Up,"" and ""All That You Have."""
2,"Awe, common on....","OK straight off, I'll tell you what I don't like about this book and many others just like it. Call me jealous, but I just HATE it when the heroine is constantly described as ""too beautiful"" or ""perfect"". URGH! Yes, she is a television news reporter and therefore, by definition must be beautiful but to have that repeated simply annoyed me. OK, I'm done with my neuroses! The book is action filled and very well written. The characters are smart and resourceful. Just next time, can't they have a pimple or bad hair day...?!"
1,"Dry, long winded, and not even funny..","Do not bother to get ""PHP5 and MySQL Bible"" unless you're a complete PHP beginner.The one OO chapter is not much more than is in the PHP manual. I got it and wish I hadn't. Overall it's long-winded and the humor is dry. Tons of useless chatter in between the information you really want.I have read this book in whole and these are the facts as I know them."
4,Worth Reading,"As the other reviewers have stated, there are quite a few code errors. However, I was impressed by the content. The dialog within the book is comprehensive as well as enjoyable. This is not a dry manual. It does jump around, but with so much covered, there's no correct navigational path to develop each topic in succession. I found it great to read the book, but create my own code based on examples found in the book. (Copying the code line by line didn't help me. However, copying the general information contained really expanded my knowledge.) This is a book for beginner and intermediate programmers interested in PHP."
1,Frustrating,"This book is full of faulty grammar - spelling and style - but no matter how annoying, you'll find out that's not the worst that can happen when trying to learn PHP from a book. Far worse is that even some of the most basic, three lined examples of code contain fatal errors.Unfortunately, most examples of code are unnecessary long and complicated and seem to be chosen randomly. I agree with other reviewers that the first few chapters about the history and variables are OK but from then on it gets really hairy.I can't believe this book still gets 3 out of 5 stars. I would never buy this book again, or recommend it to others. In fact, I'm on Amazon to order a different book on learning PHP. I have bought other books from this 'bible' series in the past but after this one I will think twice before picking up another 'Wiley bible'."
2,A third of the way through and thoroughly dissatisfied,"This book has some good introduction to PHP and MySQL, but the examples are abhorrent, with some having obviously flawed conditional logic. If you get this you will be spending most of your time debugging the inherently flawed code. This is a real headache especially if it's your first time doing things like self-submitting forms. What's even worse is that the examples are barely elucidated and there is nothing on how to correctly setup example-specific MySQL tables, columns etc. Basically you are left to copying the examples and hoping to learn something whilst debugging because there is little or no info provided on the dynamics of the code."
4,Was ok,"Lin Yutang was no doubt an interesting fellow, but very long winded. After reading Tom Hodgekinsons books about idleness and freedom, I was interested in this book because it was mentioned a lot by Tom. Not nearly an easy read and I wish it could be shortened by at least a half. Much of what he said makes sense but I wish it was more of how one should live and less of ramblings not pertaining to living. All in all, its ok. Would definitely recommend Freedom manifesto and How to be idle by Tom hodgekinson"
2,Not a Favorite here...,"I felt the need to leave an alternate opinion quickie-review as I love older chinese writing (all of Cao Xueqin, Pu Songling, Lu Xun, The Monkey stories, chinese folktales, myths, and so on) and was looking forward to this after reading the online reviews. I was very very disappointed. I admit I did not read the whole book, maybe I will go back to it someday, but I found it at times offensive (women should dress in chiffon and stay out of the business mans world!??) as well as that annoying ""get rid of your ego and just be happy enjoying the breath you inhale"" sort of advice. I am not a big feminist but gee, describing us in fabric choices was a bit much. And blatent anit-ego stuff....I can't bear that either. Others seem to love this book online and if you would like my copy, let me know. I didn't."
1,A not-so-great book,"I am really surprised to find the popularity of Lin Yu-tang in the United States. Lin can hardly be labelled as a good writer, and this book is not so great. I hope lovers of Chinese culture and literature would rather read ""The Dream of the Red Chamber"" or Lu Xun's essays."
4,Work jeans,Was trying to purchase the jeans my husband wears for work from amazon. They had so many carharts close to what he likes so took a shot in the dark and ordered 2 of the styles. Both fit as carhart's should but the material seemed lighter weight than what he was expecting. Will be okay for summer I guess.
5,Carhartt Work Dungarees,"The Carhartt Denim Work Dungarees are great for work with plenty of room to move in. The pants are very durable and tough with many pockets to carry small tools, keys etc. I will be purchasing more of these in the future."
4,Great all around jean.,"I would like to first point out that this particular model of jean uses slightly thinner fabric (11.75oz) than some of the other more rugged jeans that Carhartt sells. This model (B13) is the one most commonly found at other Brick and Mortar retailers (Sears etc).For everyday use I have found this model of jean to be plenty durable and very consistent in the sizing. I'm primarily using these as work wear but as I'm in an office setting I'm not very hard on them.A few points:The right ""leg"" pocket is perfect for more modestly sized smart-phones.The left ""leg"" pocket is quite narrow and deep.The main pockets are nice and deep and are not denim all the way down.The ""watch"" pocket is very shallow and mostly useless.These have a relaxed fuller fit so if you like 'em tight these won't do it.All in all a good ""everyday"" pair of jean if you need a few extra pockets for your daily work life."
3,"Amazed at how thin the denim for these are compared to ""signature"" work dungaree","Very thin compared to Carhartt ""Signature"" denim work dungarees... With there being only a roughly $2.50 price difference I would honestly order the signature dungarees if you are buying them for everyday work wear. I think the only bonus may be during the summer when these might be more comfortable when it is really hot and humid out. As with other pairs I have ordered I went up a size in the waist as they run small."
5,Awesome!,I bought these as a gift for my son-in-law. He was having a hard time finding any and I thought..(idea) Amazon might just have them. And they did! He is a very hard person to please but he was greatly impressed and said he would like another pair sometime soon! They are durable and practical for the kind of work that he does. They wash wonderfully well and look just as good as the day I gave them to him.
2,Tool pocket wore through within six months.,"I don't think that it is too much to expect one year's service out of a set of work dungarees, but apparently I'm wrong. I carry tools around all day at work in the tool pockets. And two out of the four pairs I bought in July have worn through the tool pockets already. Carhartt could do with a better quality denim for work dungarees."
4,Excellent and Comfortable,"I've only had these pants for about a month, but they were soft and comfortable from the start. The denim seems very durable - I almost ordered the 15oz. denim ""Signature Jean"", but I think these will be fine - and their long-term durability will be the fifth star. Sizing seemed fine contrary to other comments I've seen - I ordered the waist size one inch larger than normal (thank you Carhartt for odd waist sizes) and they're perfect. One warning about the otherwise generous and very useful pockets - the right leg double pocket is really one pocket with two openings. If you put your cell phone in one opening as I do, don't put a sharp tool in the other opening! By the way, this pant is the exact same pattern as the ""Signature Jean"" and the washed duck work dungaree - only the material is different. So take your choice - I don't think you'll be disappointed by any of them as everyday work wear. As usual the Amazon price and delivery were excellent."
4,Fiance likes them,"My fiance owns a pair of these jeans and asked for more for Christmas. He loves them! His only complaint is that the fabric on the pants pocket could be a little more sturdy. He likes to carry a pocket knife, and his knife wore a hole in the pocket within a month or two after purchasing the pants"
3,Front pockets,"The front pockets of these pants are sewn into the seam of the pant leg, the full length of the pocket. In my case, I lose items from the pockets when I sit. I did an easy return to Amazon."
2,Denim jeans,"I wasn't at all expecting cargo jeans when I opened the package, which I strongly dislike as does my husband."
2,Lid shape is awkward,"While online buying a butter dish to replace this one I thought I ought to take a minute and explain why this dish didn't work for me. It's glass, it's slippery, and it's wider on the bottom than on the top. I can't tell you how many times I've got to take the lid off and it's slipped out of my hands. Enough. I can't stand it. It's off to the garage sale box as soon as the new one gets here."
3,Good size butter dish,"We really like our new butter dish. The width is really good, making it easier to put the top back on without smearing it with butter as can happen with the narrorer dishes. The only problem is the groves running top to bottom on the cover can make it very difficult to pick up or hold if your hands are anything other than completely dry. It would have been a much better dish if the groves had gone horizontal to the bottom and top instead of vertical."
3,Better than expected,"Arrived better than expected. The tolerances between the top and bottom of the dish are a little bit loose, however it seems to work well enough and is an attractive butter dish that can hold two regular sticks side by side. Will work fine for day to day usage and looks nice enough for more formal occasions. Much better than the annoying butter dishes that hold only one stick at a time.It's neat that you can configure the dish in a few different ways to make it a deep dish, a shallow one, or almost a display dish or sorts.What else can I say? It's a butter dish."
1,i paid rush 3days shipping and i haven't received!!,"i bought it on Sun 5/18/08 8:34 PM, i paid rush 3days shipping and i haven't received!! today is 5/27/08"
4,Very surprisingly good,"Fabolous has always been an underachieving rapper, making music well-below his potential. However, he may have redeemed himself with ""Breathe"", an excellent lead single. Breathe has Fabolous spitting rhymes like never before, packed with clever punches and metaphors. Unfortunately, he has yet to abandon his Mase-like flow, which is hurting him just a bit in this song. The beat is superb with many vocal samples all over the place, it makes one hot song. If Fabolous keeps rhyming like this, he should gain the respect of hip-hop heads along with pop chart-heads too."
3,Great Product - Poor Shipping,"This is a great product. I have very sensitive hands, and these are power-free foodservice quality Nitrile gloves. So what's my beef? The seller basically wrapped tape around the box you see in the picture, slapped a shipping sticker on it and shipped it off. So the box comes crushed and full exposed. Would it kill the seller to at least wrap the box in shipping paper, or put it inside another box?"
3,Watch it for Kathleen Wilhoite.,"Pretty lame made-for-tv type movie, including all the stereotypes you'd expect. NONETHELESS, I purchased a used rental tape just to see some more of hard to find Character actress, Kathleen Wilhoite. She was very good."
2,Good But Out of Date,PC Magazine Guide to Digital Video is easy to read and helpful. However IT IS OUT OF DATE with todays technology
4,Great guide to help become a critical writing expert,"This book was an assigned textbook for a college class, however my professor encouraged each class member to consider keeping this small handbook as a great resource for any type of writing. It includes concise suggestions on grammar, critical thinking skills when writing a persuasive paper of any kind. I used it especially for writing essay's and research papers during the term and will definately use it in the future. I am glad that I purchased this book with the ring binder option instead of regular binding. This has been helpful when I'm reviewing a section because it lays flat and folds easily. It is a small book packed with big ideas for better writing."
2,Would have been better as a book,"I was looking for a meditation tape and I bought this one. I was disappointed because there was no background music or pauses during the medidation exercises. I had to retape the exercises and include the pauses myself. If you are looking for information in an audiobook format, this would probably be ok."
3,Not very useful,"This book is useful if you are your own handyman (as the author is) and want pointers on how to do things. Otherwise if you are going to hire your own contractor or handyman, it really is not very useful. For these investors, your money is better spent on a book that covers more in debt things you need to know about what kind of property to look for and how to determine a good buy and financing needed to secure it."

2,Outdated and tired,I'm not sure what some of these readers are smoking but this book has to be about 10-15 years out of date. In it's day I'm sure it was well worth the money but time to upgrade!
4,Boro Song,"Very good, mellow CD. Nice for romantic dinners and/or relaxing. Cool beats. Almost sounds like Macy Gray."
3,You can't polish a turd...,"but you can sure crap a diamond. That best describes this movie. The cinematography sucks, the sound sucks, the plot sucks, the acting sucks. It was basically made on someone's camcorder. Yet, I love it. Because it's a movie about a sasquatch that indiscriminately rapes human beings, and that makes it an important part of film history. If you're spoiled by ""real"" cinema and you're addicted to soaring John Williams film scores, happy endings, computer CGIs and Maya graphics, all-star casts, perfect voiceovers, predictable plot and character developments, ummm plots at all, and a disctinct lack of repeated reverse bestial raping, then do not buy this film. But if you enjoy really crappy movies with offensively hilarious pretexts which could have just as easily have been made by your brother's friends from college one weekend while drunk, well, buy it."
1,review of ape canyon,"did not like this movie at all, not worth the money, did not make sense most of the time. recommend u stay away from it."
1,bad product,"The book that was sent can not be used. It has deeply yellowed pages and falls apart when opened to read. It also is not the Old and New Testament that was sold at the time, it is only the Old Testament. That was never mentioned. It was purchased as a used book, it should not have been sold. This is my first bad review with Amazon"
1,"worthless , waste of money","this stuff is worthless , it is basicly fine carbon and some resins stuffes in a fine mess bag, problem is the media bag its in is so fine and the contests fo fine , its hard to get water to flow thru it and quickly clogges up . I have gotten better results using a high quality pellet carbon . Dont waste your money on this crap"
3,This movie is a repackaged TV sitcom,"This is a repackaged TV sitcom from the 70s called ""Dusty's Trail"" but without the laugh track.It has 4 episodes. Several VHS and one DVD appear to be on sale currently, with different box art. So I'm not certain the same 4 episodes are on all of them.You can also get ""Dusty's Trail"" as DVDs here at Amazon.This show ran 22 episodes for one season 73-74 iirc. It is listed in IMDB and Wiki."
2,Silly,"This movie is cute, but not worth [the money]! The acting isn't really good at all. There are some funny lines and goofy situations, but all in all, I wouldn't spend that much money on it! Try renting it or borrowing it from your local library before you go and buy it. There's one thing it IS good for : to keep kids busy."
1,Wacky Wagon Train,The movie the wackiest wagon train in the west was wacky! It is pathetic if you want a realistic if not half normal view of a wagon train. Their tricks are basic and jokes didn't really tickle my funny bone. It is so ridiculous it would be good for a hearty laugh. Its acting is poor but then again I'm a tough critic after watching John Wayne movies all my life there was no comparison. I never care to watch this movie again and don't recommend it by any means it's on my worst movie list- but then again in could strike others differently.
5,A Grand & Noble Experiment,"This is recording that is well grounded in eighties pop culture, yet still sounds avant-garde. The Album is full of Sonic Youth's trademark feedback-drenched explosions of noise and beat-inspired poetry, yet this is unlike any other SY recording. Not only do most of the songs involve a beatbox and samples, there are even Madonna and Robert Palmer covers!Humor and irreverence combines with an anything-goes approach the song structures. It sounds like the band is having a lot of fun, and that energy passes to the listener. An added bonus is the guest appearances of Mike Watt and J. Mascis.Released around the time of Sister, this album is a glorious companion-piece to that other SY classic. If you don't own this yet, you should!"
4,This is the fuel for their fire,"In many ways this is the first ""side"" recording Sonic Youth would make with the sole intention of experimentation with no real concern for commercial potential. As their career has progressed, their fans have come to expect these outings that feed the commercial side of Sonic Youth, since without them to fuel the flame their creative spark might falter."
5,A lasting lark with echoes of past and present...,"...many of us who remember the 80's and the great changes that were happening around the time this disc quietly appeared didn't immediately appreciate the genius tracks that C.Y. laid down for this once-and-out. I include myself - as I'm still finding new things in this disc almost ten years after I 'borrowed' it from a friend. It's a challenging album, and not for beginners. But it has a wonderful sound that keeps the lid firmly on the roiling sound that C.Y. keeps so close to the surface of their music. Certainly this disc should be part of anyone's musical education, if only to see what a convincingly grand job can be done on a 'throw-away' or 'lark' album (as some critics called it)."
5,Absolutely though provoking,"This story can stimulate your thoughts in many directions: history, philosophy, psychology, your own existence. At least, it did so for Sigmund Freud, Nietzshe and other great thinkers.But if you read it and CHOOSE not to be influenced, or even if you read this review but choose not to read the book, you then also understand this underground man's message:)"
5,how to plan a kwanza celebration,"This is one of the finest books I have read on the subject of a Kwanza celebration. It is a how-to book that will give anyone interested in learning the many aspects of Kwanza, the tools to prepare and enjoy a memorable and festive occasion.In fact, this book not only discusses other Kwanza events but has many timely and tasty recipes that will make the advanced and beginner cook take notice.This is one of the most important books I have read to date and I would suggest that anyone wanting to know the true meaning and cultural message of Kwanza, read this book."
4,Cable for Tom Tom,I am very satisfied with this product. It is much more flexible and durable than original. This cable is little shorter than original and it makes it more comfortable since it does not tangle as much.
5,Great for my TomTom,I had other cables at home which worked with my TomTom but the computer wouldn't recognize the navi. This cable worked and now I was able to update my navi.
4,Wii Component Cable review,"This component cable works perfectly. The only issue that some users might run into is this: the audio cables are not separated from the video cables--keep this in mind before you buy this brand. Make sure on your HDTV / EDTV that the blue, green and red video cinputs are closeby your red and white audio inputs. I haven't run into this issue, but others might. Great off-brand product."
5,Great buy for the Wii,I bought these because they are far cheaper then most on the market and the quality of the cables is good. With most component cables all 5 cables are split at the same place so you may need audio extensions to reach to your receiver. You can find the cable and female2female connectors you need on amazon for a cheap price.These cables to supply a 480p image and the complaints about pixelation are just by those who don't understand SD and HD resolution and how games are made. These cables work great and the price is a bargain. A good buy.
1,Disappointed,"My complaints have nothing to do with the quality of this cable but with the ""component"" image you receive when turning on progressive scan on the Wii. In my opinion while the image may be a little sharper on my 42 inch 720p capable display it actually looks worse than interlace because of the pixilation you can now see."
2,Worked well in the get go. Then dissapointed greatly.,"Trying to purchase a lock for a decent price in this economy and having adequate protection for my road bike, I decided to purchase the Onguard U lock. Shipped quickly and looked well. I even WD-40'd it to make sure all the mechanisms were working to its full potential. After locking it outside Subway to a street post one day, I go and eat and come back and unlock it. After I unlock it, the key has broken a small piece off inside of the lock. I was more than lucky to have it not break when I was locking it down as my bike would have been there to be stripped down. The keys are cheaper than ever and I would never buy from Onguard's U locks again. Overall, it has been used less than 20 times before rupture."
1,Malfunctioned in less than a month,"I bought this U lock on January 8th of this year. It failed 4 days ago, the locking mechanism has seized up and I could barely get it off the U. It's fully locked up now.This is a piece of junk, don't buy it."
2,Alright,"The keys break easily, and the lock seized up after about a year of use, but it took me an hour and a half to saw through the lock with a hacksaw when I needed to get it off. I guess that means it's good?"
1,AVOID. mechanism seizes in rain.,i have the pitbull and used it for about a year and it had a couple of drops but after a few rain showers over a couple of days the locking got more and more stiffer and now the key wont turn at all. terrible.this is a common problem it seems with this lock and im glad it didnt happen when the bike was locked up.also the lock rattled alot when riding as it has no rattle bumpers which was annoying.theres no point buying this when for a bit more u can get a kryptonite which has a much better build quality.
1,It breaks and starts coming apart,"Ive had this for a few years and about halfway through the life all the plastic at the bottoms had cracked and came off somehow. it still locks but it looks terrible, and might possibly be tamper-able."
1,Junk- Garbage,"This lock sucks. Save your money. Within one week the holder for the lock was broken. Now a month into this lock and the cage that protects where you insert the key is broken. This lock sucks, SAVE YOUR MONEY DO NOT BUY THIS LOCK IT SUCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Do not buy!,"I have purchased two of these OnGuard Bulldog locks, the big one, and then a smaller one. The big one key stopped working about a month ago, and then the smaller one that I just bought now doesn't work. I think the product is defective. The first one I bought worked for over a year, and the second one lasted about 3 months. I would not purchase this item."
1,Locked Forever,"I read previous reviews of this lock, and really I am to blame because, silly me, thought ""there is no way this will happen to me."" but sure enough, after no more than 3 uses, it locked forever, luckily not on my bike. TRUST ME. DO NOT BUY."
4,Good enough.,"I don't use the cable; the lock is heavy enough on its own. The mounting mechanism is truly awful, I had it mounted vertically and the plastic broke on it after maybe a month of using it. While it worked it worked just okay. I have a friend who mounted it horizontally though, and hers has held up. I've had it for almost a year now and I like the lock itself, I just wish I didn't have to lock it around my neck (handy that it's big enough to do this and I can lock up two bikes with it) put it in my bag or carry it in one hand. The tiny flashlight has actually come in super handy more than once and for more than just unlocking/locking my bike. The keys seem delicate, so I am cautious with them, but I haven't had one break on me. This one gets a 4, but if I could find a 5, I'd go with that next time."
2,"Don't buy, better options","In case you have not picked this up already from the numerous reviews: DON'T BUY THIS LOCK ... I can think of few instances where using all caps is appropriate, but this is one. As others have noted already: The lock itself is solid enough, but the base of the lock cracked apart after a few months, and the whole thing rusts quickly, even if your bike is only very occasionally caught in passing rain (I store my bike inside my house). The key can sometimes get stuck, and it sounds like it gets permanently stuck for some. And the notches on the lock are not beveled at the corners so its very easy to ding your frame and chip the paint. The mount for the frame is cheap and locks onto your frame permanently with a ratcheting mechanism, and is a pain to take the lock on and off of.In short, PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE learn from others mistakes, and spend the few extra dollars to buy a product from another manufacturer. You really will be happier with a different lock"
1,got a lemon,"After careful research, I found this lock to be the best value -- strong and well-priced. I sent it to my son at college. After using it for a few days, he was unable to open it for a few days in a row, he said. Then one day he got it to work. He used it for a few days and then he could not open it when he stuck the key in again. It was just jambed shut. After about two weeks of trouble, he bought another lock. I am not sure if he just got a lemon or if there is an inherent problem with this lock."
3,"Happy with security of lock, but not sure of quality of product overall.","Haven't used the lock in a few months, and I can't get it to open (I have the key, and it turns the lock, but can't get the lock to pull apart).I thought this lock was well made, and secure, but it isn't working now. So, this is a quality issue. I will be able to return it to the store I bought it from, and get a replacement, but it is something to consider."
5,Great Lock,"I didnt start to read these reviews until after I paid for it. I see alot of people on here that say the lock gets hard to turn and eventually stops opening or the key breaks inside. Well after only a couple days of using i started to notice that the lock was becoming harder to open so I took the advise of one reviewer on here and sprayed some WD40 inside the lock. I turned the key several times inside and sprayed more WD40. This actually made the lock work better then ever. Its been about a week now and the lock is still working better then ever so I would recommend that anyone who gets this lock, spray a little WD40 in there and you should have no issues !"
2,came apart when dropped,"I had this lock for about two years. Then one morning I dropped it. It came apart exposing the interior cylinder made of plastic. The plastic was cracked in half. Although I was able to reassemble it, I have no faith in it's security value and will not use it again. I am replacing it with a Kryptonite New York Fahgettaboutit and hopefully I will be able to forget about it."
3,I thought the cable would be longer.,"I'm sure this lock works wonderfully, but as it turns out, I haven't used it yet. I didn't pay close enough attention to the length specifications, and I envisioned being able to loop it through both tires and possibly the seat, while having the ULock to lock the bike itself securely to something else. SO bottom line is that I don't feel comfortable leaving my very expensive bike just locked up somewhere, but I suppose I'll use the lock at some point and stop being so paranoid! :)"
3,Could be better.,Pretty solid lock. I dropped it from about waist height and the plastic around the lock broke. If they got rid of the weak plastic it would be much better.
1,KEY BECAME PERMANETLY STUCK,"So i rarely use this lock maybe 5 times. well on the 6th time i used it the key became stuck i could engage and disengage the U component but the key was stuck. I was pissed, i had bike 5 miles to a store only to find myself not being able to go into the store because the stupid lock stopped working. And another thing, this lock is HEAVY, i would recommend getting another kind just for the weight issue alone. So yes first it was the weight but add to that the key getting stuck on the 6th use this product gets a fail."
1,Thieves!!!!,"I waited so long for this lock that some thief took my bike before this darned thing arrive. It's already been 2 weeks. Now, what am I going to do with this piece of junk?"
5,Solid secure bike lock,"This is the best bike lock you can use to secure your bike. The additional cable allows you to secure both your wheels as well. Its heavy to haul around on your bike, so if you plan carry it a lot, you may want to find a lighter bike lock. But if security is your primary objective, it's hard to find a better lock on the market.I use mine to secure my bike at work during the day. I leave my lock attached to the bike rack when I leave at night, so I don't have to transport it back and forth every day.I have another lighter lock that I carry in my bike bag that I use for quick stops at the grocery store on the way home. The lighter lock is enough to defer an opportunistic thief, but I feel better using this stonger lock to protect my bike when I need to secure it for a longer period of time."
2,Anti-theft program practically a scam - read the terms,"3.2 Todson, Inc. will NOT be liable if theft occurred where:Torches, battery operated tools or power tools were used to open the lock.To File A Claim Under This Limited Anti-theft Program:4.1 Report the theft to the police within 72 hours. FAILURE TO REPORT THE THEFT TO POLICE WITHIN 72 HOURS OF DISCOVERY VOIDS THIS LIMITED ANTI- THEFT PROGRAM.4.2 Notify Todson, Inc. in writing within seven (7) days of the theft by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the above address and include:4.2.1 a copy of the police report indicating that you reported the theft within 72 hours of discovery,4.2.2 a copy of the claim filed with your insurance company, if applicable,4.2.3 at least one original key from your OnGuard lock,4.2.4 your broken OnGuard lock, and4.2.5 your Registration Form, and all applicable attachments, if not previously submitted."
4,Still working,"Ive had this for over a year now and it still works perfectly. I have not ran into any problems, althought I did lose the security cable that it came with. I like that they gave me 4 extra keys, and the main one has a little light on it, makes unlocking my lock at night easier."
5,8 years and still going strong,"I bought an Onguard lock and cable about 8 years ago. It stays in the back of my truck where i use it to secure my ladder, or my drain cleaning machine and also my mountain bikes. This thing has been exposed to the rain and snow with absolutely no care on my part and it still works fine. It isn't lite or compact, but anything that last as long as this thing has is worth 5 stars."
4,digal scale weight,"I ordered these weights for other purpose than scale calibration. they preform well in the project i used them for. for those who a interested in what i used them for, i created a small piledriver."
4,Great winter blades,"Good winter blade. The rubber enclosure keeps them from icing up. Use them on my Suburban and if I was smarter, I would have purchased one for the rear windshield wiper. Highly recomend this."
3,Misleading CD,"Only the first half of this CD is Carlos Montoya on guitar, the other half is Mario Escudero on Guitar (which is why tracks 10-19 sound so much better!)... I'm glad I realized this early on, because enjoying the 2nd half of the CD was giving Montoya too much credit, he's not that good. Only 3 stars because the first half is a 1 and the second half a 5."
5,A must have for anyone who is in the process of a divorce,"This book is a must have for anyone who is in the process of a divorce. It is full of practical advice on everything you need to know to protect yourself, your children and your home from financial ruin during a divorce. It is written in a a clear and friendly manner. I highly recommend this book - it packed with common sense advice, and reassuring to turn to, while you are in the midst of a highly emotionally charged time."
1,Not very helpful,"What I wanted was book that would help us figure out how to split up amicably and without a lot of stress. Instead, I got a lot of ""go see a divorce lawyer."" Someone in an earlier review said lawyer's love this book, I think that person's right. Guess tht's why so many lawyers review this book positively."
1,"Lawyers love it, your wallet won't","There's two books with this same title, and I bought both when it came time to do the deed.The first book, published by Nolo, assumes you want to avoid lawyers and handle most of the work yourself. It shows you how to look at the big picture, to separate the financial picture from the emotional. It's packed with legal and practical advice throughout. My copy became worn out, I referred to it so much over the ensuing months of my divorce.The other (this one) seems to copy the original book above, but continually encourages you to go to attorneys -- where you'll spend loads of money for no good reason. No wonder most of the positive reviews of this book are written by lawyers!"
1,This is the wrong book!,"I got this book on accident after my friend recommended the Nolo book by the same name. I was really not expecting much and this book lived up to my expectations because it kept saying ""Go see a lawyer! Go see a lawyer!"" Then my friend saw I had the wrong book... Part of the reason I picked up this book was all the good reviews, but then I see that many of them come from Philadelphia, where this book's author is from. Coincidence? Probably not because all their comments don't seem to match the contents. Do yourself a favor and get the Nolo book, it's really much better."
5,Worked perfect,I needed an enclosure for my chickens. This has helped considerably and cheaply. Now I don't need to worry about them getting out and eaten.
4,Deer netting does the trick,"This product does the trick for keeping out the deer, however the bunnies think that it is funny to nibble holes in the bottom of the netting to gain access."
2,Sadly Not deer proof,"We got everything set up real nice and the deer fence was almost invisible.Our garden had been growing really well when I got a call from the neighbour that the deer were in our garden.We now have wire around our garden.Not as pretty, but deer proof.The netting didn't keep the deer out."
5,Very Happy,"We installed 5 rolls of fence using 3/4"" x 10' metal electric conduit for poles. With 2 of us installing it took about 5 hours.We used plumbers zip ties to attach to pole. Deer got in one time and haven't been back!Went up easily, no tangling of mesh. Easy to repair if broken using zip ties. We live in a pretty remote forest and have used many things to keep the deer out, this is working better than any other option"
1,A Waste of Time and Money,"This product is not nearly strong enough to deter deer from entering our property. The deer have a tendancey to nudge the barrier, which causes the netting to break where it is tied to the posts. Wind also causes the netting to break at the ties. Ultimately, with enough breaks, the netting will sag and no long be a barrier to keeping the deer out.I am currently looking for something a lot stronger."
2,So thin it's almost not there,"This stuff is incredibly thin. And I can't quite understand all of the great reviews, especially the ones that suggest that this stuff is easy to work with. They must have incredible patience, or weren't expecting much. (I bought a heavier version of this type netting previously, and had a pretty good idea what I was getting.) It is hard to work with (don't wear anything with buttons) because it's so light and catches on everything. I can't imagine using it for fencing - I drape it over azaleas, etc. I think it discourages the deer, because otherwise, they'd certainly be able to chew right through it. I note that nowhere on the package does it give any indication of how thick the plastic is. That's because it's almost not there."
4,"It works, but it's flimsy","I have used this netting for several months now to keep deer and cats off my vegetable and berry beds. It definitely works: the deer can't seem to see it and are irritated by the way it feels when they try to bite at the greens, and it's the same for cats (which formerly used to dig in my raised beds). An added bonus: if you keep it tight against the ground (or the side of a raised bed), it is an effective slug repellent, since they seem to feel the same as the deer and the cats. I've actually watched a slug creep up to the netting, feel it, and then turn around. All this being said, it's very frail stuff -- very easy to tear. I was walking past a bed with a hoe and accidentally snagged some of the netting, and it tore a 3' hole. Nevertheless, I would recommend it (and I'm about to buy more)."
4,Deer Netting,"Deer season is over and the old bird netting that I strung around the garden worked pretty well to keep deer from eating the garden goodies. It didn't work as well as a real fence but it was cheap. I'm hoping that the deer netting will be a little sturdier than the bird netting and that critters (dogs, raccoons? deer?) will not tear holes in it as easily. This netting does not appear to be made of thicker material but it is a ""square-hole"" netting rather than the ""diamond-hole"" bird netting so I'm hopeful."
3,You Must Be A Fan,"I am afraid I'm either selling or donating my DVD. Although I enjoy old horror movies, I found myself dozing on this one. The big Victorian house used is an excellent setting. There are definitely some great scenes too and Deborah Kerr and the children are excellent in their roles. But there are also some sections of the movie that drag a bit and probably should have ended up on the cutting room floor. So I highly recommend you rent this before purchasing it. I wish I had instead of trusting the high praise reviews here so I wouldn't be donating a movie instead of returning it to Netflix. By the way, my wife felt the same as me about the movie so it isn't just my perspective."
2,Really wanted to like it ...,"My high expectations may have skewed my impression of this movie. I especially enjoy old atmospheric ghost stories, but I felt there were too many holes in this one and I really did not like the ending. The governess (in my opinion) seemed to jump to conclusions without really letting the viewer in as to why. I have never read the book and plan to do so. I expected more from the Truman Capote script. The cinematography by future Hammer director Freddie Francis was excellent. There was a high ""creepy"" factor. Fans of ""The Haunting"", ""Village of the Damned"" or ""Curse of the Demon"" will want to give this one a try."
2,Befuddled at praise,"As of the creation of this review, 150 preceding Amazon.com reviewers had given this film an average review of 4.5 stars. My wife and I are at a loss to understand why. Oh sure, Deborah Kerr if photogenic and a fine actress; supporting cast is good caliber; cinematography/special effects/scenes & film-sets were all first class. However, like a beautiful woman all dressed up with no place to go, none of the above-listed positives can outweigh the lack of a compelling finish to this screenplay - it's a fizzle."
2,The Innocents DVD - Movie,Not a great movie. I suppose it was considered good for its time. The acting was horrible as were many movies in 1961 I suppose. I was bored with it halfway through. I love old movies...but this one's not on my list of favorites. I don't recommend it.
3,IS JUST OK!!,"This movie. Of course is classic because made 1961 ..Doesn't mean is good & great classic movie, because is old!!. Like that cheesy over rated movie call ""THE HAUNTING""(1963) with cheesy lame story and special effects, but the innocents, a bit better seen then ""the haunting"".! I guess is ok for rental and one time seen,If u like old movies. But not definitely to buy for sure. just have a little old chessy/suspense, that's all about it!"
5,Wonderful classic entertainment...,"I order so many of these classic films that I believe my wife may leave me if just one more silent film graces my dvd player. On that note, a sarcastic one at that, I would say that this film was highly entertaining. The acting is superb and the storyline is well written. I will agree that the pace may or may not allow younger viewers to become engulfed with the story, but I am only 31 and was ""locked in"" from the first scene. A true winner for classic horror fans. Also seek out Village of the Damned which was released in the same time period. Great Stuff!!!!"
1,Tremendous film 5 stars--1 star for this version...,"Once again americans are forced to suffer the lack of extra features and the UK gets a 'real' version of this delightful film. Frankly I'm tired of the film industries doing this with dvds. If there are special features for a dvd, those features should be on every copy no matter what country you live in! I don't think it's too much to ask for and do we really need dvd regions? I think not!Thanks for nothing Fox Century!"
5,A Highlight of the Horror genre!,"This is one not to be missed. Great story, great acting and superb cinematography make this flick a joy from start to finish.For reference, this film is in the same great league as the films Night of the Demon, The Haunting, and The Cat People."
5,The Innocents,"20th Century Fox! Are you mad? Where is the intelligence in only releasing a sub standard print on VHS instead of the superb Cinemascope one that exists of probably the finest movie version of a ghost story (with Warner's 'The Haunting'- released last year on DVD), Jack Clayton's 'The Innocents' adapted from Henry James' 'The Turn of the Screw'. Here is a movie crying out to be released on the format with Freddie Francis' incredible B/W photography.Please sort yourselves out and get this on your books for 2005. If you don't, Quint will be coming for you!!JOTH GAMBOLD"
5,A cut above other horror films,"Obviously this film is on several levels the allegorical nature of this film doesnt detract from the ghost story however as evidenced from the good reviews from people that see it as purely a horror film.I'm quite surprised at a lot of negativity directed at the heroine of the story. Thats whats so refreshing about the film a woman confronted by the bizarre and twisted who isnt interested in only saving her own skin and who shows real compassion and courage.Without going into the allegory specifically I didnt find the ending horrifying, though of course it was quite tragic.An expertly crafted film with astonishing performances from the children and the female lead as well as the housekeeper. To say that your average modern horror film isnt in the same ballpark as this film is an understatement."
5,The greatest of all horror films!,"This brilliant adaptation of ""The Turn of the Screw"" contains all of the key ghost-story archetypes, from the isolated Victorian setting to the ambiguious appearances of apparitions.Georges Auric created some of the best music ever written for the screen. His score for this film could inspire a nightmare without accompanying the images! This may be his best score for a horror film, although who could forget his trademark Hearse-Driver cue for ""Dead of Night""?The scene where Miss Giddens forces Flora to confront Miss Jessel may very well be the most chilling sequence ever put on film. The conclusion is even more powerful, but in a different way... beyond description."
5,Unbeatable atmosphere.,"It's a little strange that so few ghost movies have been made in Hollywood, when considering this interesting subject matter holds so many possibilities. ""The Haunting"", ""The Uninvited"" and ""Curse Of The Cat People"" are other old classics, and ""The Changeling"" and ""The Shining"" newer ones. But Tinseltown has always cared more about what glitters and sparkles, and you can hardly say that about ghosts, I guess. (-Unless you think ""The Frighteners"" is a movie about ghosts and not a CGI show-off !.) Kerr is perfect as the woman who sees the apparitions, Jenkins is wonderful as the housekeeper who knows a thing or two, and the children are just magnificent. As a lover of this particular genre I've always seen the spectres in this film as real, and not just something in Kerr's head. -It's more scary that way, in my opinion. All we're waiting for now, is for FOX to wake up and put this masterpiece out on DVD - letterboxed, naturally !."
5,Still scary after all these years,"I saw this film as a child and remember being so terrified that I had to spend most of the time hiding in the theatre lobby while it was playing! Everything about the way the movie is written,filmed,paced,and especially,acted,from beginning to end, works perfectly to create a completely believable aura of supernaturally creepy malevolence.(and,as has been mentioned by other reviewers here, without relying on those fancy special effects that are so overly relied upon today!)"
1,What ?????,"I love psychological type 'horror' movies like The Haunting so I thought I'd like this one as well. After dozing through a lot of the movie all I could say at the end was ""What in the world did I just watch?"" You really never get any kind of answers or, for that matter, any real clue as to what in the wide, wide world of sports went on here. Are the kids possesed? Is the nannie? Does the houskeeper know more than she lets on? How about the uncle? Where, if anywhere, does he fit in. About the most fun to be had watching this movie would be to take a drink everytime one of the children said ""my dear"". At least then you'd get something out of this horrid film. If you must, rent this from the 99 cent rack. Don't go over that."
1,Disappointing at Best,"The Innocents says it all! There was not a lot of talent, other than a few of the actors, displayed throughout this movie. This movie was not at all what I expected and was a big yawn."
5,42 Years Later,"I've just finished reading the chapter on the composition of ""The Turn of the Screw"" in Colm Toibin's ""The Master"", a novel about Henry James. It reminded me again of ""The Innocents"", the film adaptation of ""Turn"". I viewed it 42 years ago when I was 17 years old. The movie so frightened me that I walked out of the theater before it ended, the only time in my life I have done so. It still chills me to think of it. The eerie music, the slow build-up of tension, the ambiguity surrounding the children's knowledge - how beautifully the film conveys a sense of evil. Please, release the DVD so I can see if the movie stands up to my memory."
1,bad movie,"We love mysteries and my wife and I like Deborah Kerr but this movie was very disappointing. Boring, not scary just blah. It was a shame seing her in this bad movie."
4,Very scary,This film is very scary. I once watched it when i was very young and i couldn't sleep for years!!!I watched it recently and it was very good.Highly recommendable!
4,The Innocents,"This is a brilliant old black and white horror movie - the kind you just don't see anymore.Brilliant location, eeeeeeeerie music, and fright after fright.Even though I am a jaded old horror movie buff I still loved it and would watch it again especially late on a dark night, in a house that is deathly silent except for the wind howling around the eves. Delicious stuff!!"
5,The Innocents,"Expertly directed by Jack Clayton and shot by the legendary Freddie Francis, this chilling horror tale uses muffled sounds and fleeting glimpses to cast its spell of dread and mounting terror. Kerr is terrific in the lead, a woman who must determine whether she's being haunted or going mad, and Martin Stephens and Pamela Franklin are appropriately remote as the two possessed children. Also look for Michael Redgrave as the children's aloof uncle (whatever his faults, he's wise enough to stay away). Fans of psychological horror should pounce."
5,Another classic chiller,"This black & white movie starring Deborah Kerr is truly chilling. Without the use of blood, guts or special effects the film has a creepy quality that makes you watch every dark corner for an unexpected scare. Shadows and haunts weave in & out of the lives of two children (brother & sister) left to the care of hired help. When Miss Giddens (Kerr) comes as governess to care for the children she soon discovers she has competition for the attention and affection of the two youngsters. As she confronts dark forces she attempts to unravel the sinister influence from their innocent hearts and minds. Her only hope is to save them before they are lost forever."
5,Knocks your socks off,"Part of the reason this movie is so good is that it suggests almost everything. It lets your imagination decide the rest. It hints at all sorts of evils, especially those done to children, but always manages to make you think that the sexually repressed governess may be imagining them. The minor characters are well-drawn and the children are fantastic. The melody of the music-box will be going through your head for days afterward! If you're expecting special effects, look elsewhere. This is definitely in the psychological thriller mode."
5,Possibly The Best Ghost Story Ever Put On Film!,"In this truely scary movie, a young woman (EXCELLENTLY played by Deborah Kerr) is sent to take care of two young children in a country mansion. However, she seems to get more than she baragained for when the children appear as if they have been possesed by the past inhabitents of the manor. Eerily chilling and very frightening movie proves that you don't need gore and hi-tech effects to scare your audience: you just need atmosphere, suspense, and tension, three things this movie is full of!"
1,Misleading title........,"Where's the system? You're not going to find it in this book.Buy the newsletter Mr.Bowser is preaching about,maybe you'll find it in there.This book is basically an introductory offer to the newsletter.Misleading title,very dissappointed reading it....."
2,Not very good,"It looks like this course was initially written by someone who knows the language and then reworked by someone who does not. It is not consistent, there are overlaps, and contradictions. It is very difficult to follow and has left me with too many unanswered questions. I am now using another book, actually two other courses. I would not recommend this course to anyone."
2,Extremely blah book of boring short stories,"Of the half dozen short stories contained in the book, only one is mildly interesting. Every story deals with war time back here at home with all the discussions about rationing, blackouts, boys off serving etc. That in itself is not off-putting but the book is supposed to be mystery flavored-and it is not-it's a group of stories about not much of anything.The ONLY little tale that is interesting enough to be recognized is ""The Lipstick"" that comes at the very end. It is a clever story that makes you wonder ""did she fall or was she pushed?""I bought this book because my taste runs to the quirky and a little out of the ordinary mystery and/or thriller. This was neither nor was it at all interesting. Don't even know why I finished reading it."
5,A wonderful read,I really enjoyed this terrifying tale. It brings up some interesting questions about humanity. I would recommend this to anyone.
2,Hasn't aged well,"Seemed to be a contrived plot at best. The sheer wrongness of the ""sci-fi"" animals to people did not help me enjoy this book in the slightest. It's understandable that people may have thought that possible at one point, but for me, a reader in this day and age, that sort of transformation would be best left to fantasy stories."
4,Worth Getting Around To.,"I have always enjoyed reading classics whenever possible but have recently made a concerted effort to read the ones I missed out on. The Island.. is worth getting to if only for the unique imagery and gloomy setting. This novel definitely has an atmosphere of ""bummer"" but still keeps you on your toes with the deeper insights concerning man's discontent with otherness, the dilemmas of science vs. cruelty, etc. Slightly dragging at certain points but I'm of a world of instant gratification so take it from where it comes. And hell, it's free! Why NOT read it?"
4,Excellent book,"H.G. Wells' The Island of Dr. Moreau is a very good book. When I got it the Kindle version was free, so a good deal. I don't like having to pay for public domain books, but I like having them to carry with me. This is very thought provoking and not one you can easily forget. The novel is a sort of commentary on what it is to be human. The science fiction used is a little difficult to suspend disbelief for, what with modern biological knowledge of genetics, but it isn't something that really interferes with the story. A very interesting read, I strongly recommend The Island of Dr. Moreau."
3,"OK, Could be better.",The book is so much better than the movie. It gives you a better understanding of the characters bringing them to life. The imagery is also way better. but it lacks focus.
5,New Timeliness and Aimlessness of Existence,"Wells commented that this book was in a way an exercise of youthful balsphemy. Perhaps. Wells, like every other intelligent human being of Victorian England, could not escape Darwin's theory of evolution with all of its implications. But the ideas go deeper. What is the meaning of human existence? Is the world just a place of aimless suffering and a mere survival through a series of trials and errors?The book has now become more timely than ever, with the completion of the Human Genome Project which, along with possibility of improving our lives with better drugs, opens the possiblity of engineering mutant beings based on human genes. In a somewhat related development, human organs are already grown on/in the bodies of other animals. Cloning, genetic engineering, and harvesting of organs is a warning that our entire world may become an island of Dr. Moreau. Scary stuff."
3,A Must for Sailers (confusing for everyone else!),"This book has a very slow start that is hard to get into. Every other word is another obscure reference to a part of a sail boat. Hard to follow for the first 1/4 of the book. In addition, there are a lot of terms that only people in England would understand.Anyway, if you can follow books with a confusing dialogue (i.e. Shakespeare) you may like this book. Otherwise, just get the movie with Brando & Val Kilmer."
4,My Hero,Cherry's adventures in nursing and her idealism would encourage many children to consider nursing as a career. Lot's of fun.
3,A unique read,"Not bad. This is my first HG Wells book. The opening scene on the ship is very interesting. Actually, the whole set-up was interesting--this would be the first 1/3 of the book. After that, however, when Wells' gets into the long descriptions of the manimal creatures, for me, it really tires the story. Overall, though, the plot flows freely and is mostly interesting. In addition, the characters are distinguishable and appealing. I really liked Wells' writing style--it's refreshing and unique. I'll definitely give another of his novels a read."
2,Obviously Not for the Kindle Fire,"I am speaking from my experience with this title on the Kindle Fire, so I can't comment for any other iterations of the device. However, my copy of this ebook didn't display correctly and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who owns a Fire. The pages were presented in a blurry text (which cannot be zoomed), boasting a horrid blue background for each and every page. Though the text will surely be legible to some, I cannot bear to read through even a book of this size in the form presented. I would advise most everyone to spring for the free edition of this title once it is back online."
3,classic story,"Prior to reading this novel, I was very familiar with the story, having watched at least one movie adaptation. The story is a classic one, and I imagine most readers would be familiar with at least the concept prior to reading. The concept of the story is a good one, but the writing style is a bit dry. Some parts of the story are a little confusing to read. Although it was written some time ago, some of the themes, like the ruthless exploitation of science, are timeless. Still, it was hard to get past some of the dialogue and writing, which would transform this from a solid read, to something special.Carl Alves - author of Two For Eternity"
3,Worth reading carefully,"I went through this book pretty quickly, and read it the way you'd read a Dan Brown book. As a result, when I finished it I thought of it as a freaky adventure story with a few comments on evolution.However, after reading the afterword by Brian Aldiss, I realized how deep the rabbit hole really goes with this thing. H.G. Wells has not only talked about evolution and weird science, but tied in religion, the human capacity for reason, the abuse of knowledge, and enough other deep thoughts to make your head spin. I might have to give it a second read sometime.If you can pace yourself while reading it to let the ideas sink, then I recommend the read."
5,A great perspective of humanity.,"This book contains views about inhumanity which is very relative to todays technological advances. H.G Wells has written a extraordinary book which will never get outdated and will always be looked upon as a classic. The tale which is told brings up many different perspectives of the inhuman creations of Dr Moreau and many can either be argued or agreed to by the reader which makes this a very moving, realistic and interactive book. A book which must be read!!"
3,"memorable classic book, but poor audiobook quality","I don't really have much to say about The Island Of Doctor Moreau in terms of the story. It's a science fiction classic, 'nuff said. But what I do have to add is that the quality of this particular audiobook is pretty poor. The reader drones on in a monotone. I end up missing a lot of the story and have to constantly rewind because my mind easily wanders because the presentation is so poor. Also the quality of the audio in general is really bad. Hissy and grainy."
5,"A Catalyst For Modern Fiction in Books, Videogames, and Movies","Frankenstein is to resurrecting the dead as The Island of Dr. Moreau is to genetically splicing, or chimeras.The premise is simple: A guy is the only survivor of a shipwreck and ends up on an island in which a doctor is genetically modifying animals and turning them into humanoids; and of course, at some point, the crap hits the fan. It's a very odd book but a classic in science fiction.I admit that it's a hard book to read, until you get into the flow of things. But I can also say that without this book, there would be no Bioshock, no Resident Evil."
3,Didn't finish,"Couldn't get into this book at all. Although I enjoyed it at first, it became a little too strange for me."
5,Chilling..... Masterful............ Unforgetable,A great narrative of experiments gone wrong. A wonderful story of survival in the most impossible conditions. Highly reccomended.
5,why pay so much?,this is just about a specific edition which sells for three times (!?) what it should. stick with the better editions- likeThe Island Of Doctor Moreauwhich are a third of the cost
4,Eerily realistic and prophetic,"It has lately come to my attention that I am a huge H. G. Wells fan. Not that I have a problem with that, I just somehow managed to not notice until recently. But I do really love his books, and this one is no exception. I found it to be the perfect balance between action and introspection. The subject matter is horrifying (and sometimes gory), but very realistic and similar to what is currently being done with modern medicine and surgery. As usual, Wells shows himself to be almost creepily prophetic. The science in this book would be a little off if it had been written 50 years ago, but it was written in 1896!!! Whereas so many science fiction authors have pictured the future with unisex silver bodysuits and hovercars and anthropomorphic robots, H. G. Wells is the only one who ever seems to get close to where the future is actually going, and all from 115 years ago."
3,Period Piece,H. G. Wells's The Island of Doctor Moreau is best read as a period piece. A materialist speculation on the singularity of man and the evolutionary theory spurred by Darwin is superimposed on what today seems a hackneyed castaway story coupled with an grossly inflated view of the possibilities of surgery.
5,the island of doctor moreau,"book is very well writen. it is an classic I enjoyed it through it is an older book it keeps the attention of the reader, there is a movie on this book but the book is better."
3,Cheap reprint from public domain,"Filiquarian Publishing, LLC published this book under the idea that it is in ""public domain status."" Meaning, it is not any better than you would find online. The book is readable, but emphasis (bold or italics) are done by an underscore before and after the word(s). Example: ""_His_ is the lightning flash, we sang. _His_ is the deep, salt sea."" (page 82) To me, it is annoying to read it this way. You occasionally find extra quotation marks and a double dash (--) in the place of an ellipsis (...). On page 41, you get all of the above.The binding is right up there with self-published titles. The cover is as basic as it gets, and has no text on the spine (see picture.) The back cover has merely a UPC barcode. On my copy, the glue they used for the spine was pressed out and made a rather strange bind. By strange, I mean cheap-looking.Anyway, if you are looking for an inexpensive copy of this book and don't care about the bindery or text issues, then this book is for you."
4,Wells is always a good read,"A ""low tech"" thriller that requires a good imagination and some brain exercise! Must be my 10th reading first on android!"
5,Exciting and gripping,The Island of Doctor Moreau by H. G. WellsThe Island of Dr. Maruea is a great mixture of plot and intellectual enjoyment. Anyone will like this classic science fiction thriller.
5,Staggeringly good!,"I thought the book was more about what happens to Society when the thought of a central God is removed. We have moved into a world where Christianity is a million miles away from how it mattered to people in 1896, and there is confusion and hostility with those to whom religion matters a great deal. The Society of the Beasts surely mirrors what Wells thought we were all heading for in 1896? He was, in part, quite right. A book which has many interpretations, and amazingly gains more as the decades pass."
4,Wonderful,"HG Wells did it again in this book. I was absolutely horrified, terrified, and mortified all the way through. A real page turner as well as a good scare. I'm still squeamish to think of it!"
4,Smile and Look Alive!,"With 'Look Alive', Incubus once again proves what an amazing live band they are.The different concert clips can seem annoying at first, but you get used to them quickly.Brandon Boyd's flawless live performance is present and his voice is, as always, amazing.The whole band is on fire...doing what they do best; playing music.The in-between ""behind the scenes"" footage give a great insight of the band on their worldwide tour. We see them experience different cultures in countries around the world.We also get to follow Mike when he is getting an operation for his Carpel Tunnel Syndrome.Standout performances include:Quicksand / A Kiss to Send Us OffAnna MollyRedefineNebulaSick Sad Little WorldAquaeous Transmission"
5,"Incubus ""Look Alive"" CD/DVD","I originally bought the standard single DVD edition of ""Look Alive"" because, 1.I LOVE this Band! 2.New concert footage of this band! But what I did not know was that there was a limited CD/DVD version of it at Best Buy stores. Well, when I found this out naturally it piqued my interest. It turns out the cd consists of 11 original scores created for the dvd by guitarist Mike Einziger and heard at different parts within the dvd. All of the scores are stand-out tracks and great for an Incubus collection. The cd also includes 6 bonus live tracks including the new songs Punch Drunk and Look Alive.--Bottom Line--Buy the CD/DVD version of ""Look Alive"" even if it is a few dollars more. Also the DVD is Region 0 so no matter where you buy it from the DVD will work on your player.Thanks,And I hope this was helpful. :-)"
3,Not all concert footage,"While I still beleive after watching this video that Incubus is one of the most creative bands, do not buy this thinking you are getting a full concert. it does however show you glimpses of the band off stage and how they act when not on stage. if you are a fan, buy it,if you just want to watch them perform live, then maybe another video is one you should buy."
5,INCUBUS ROCKS!,"yeah this DVD is rockin, LOTS of footage from the Light Grenades tour. my friends that i went to the Tahoe show are in the DVD. and Nebula live what more can you ask for. well i guess some Make Yourself songs would be cool but all the other dvds are packed full of that. this is a good one."
4,Hoped for more bonus features.,"When I first got the DVD I was certainly pleased with the product. I bought the Blu Ray on a pre-sale, when I finally got it I thought it would have some sort of bonus features like the Red Rocks Blu Ray did, being that the Blu Ray disc has more storage capacities than a DVD. I thought, you know, maybe they'll (by they I don't mean the actual band) include all of their music videos (what fan wouldn't like that). Maybe the whole footage of their KROQ appearance., but no just a different menu. The quality of the Blu Ray obviously is amazing to say the least, but you can tell the footage comes from the different cameras, as the scenes changes one notices the changes in quality of the different cameras. All in all I'm still happy i got, being that I'm long time Incubus fan."
4,Almost as good as the morning view dvd,"I like this dvd because unlike the morning view dvd, you can ""play all"". but it has less footage and interviews with them and less about what it was like to film videos and make the light grenades record. It is a good dvd but not the best, depending on what you are looking for."
5,Worth the money,"The Look Alive DVD is excellent. Saw this tour January 2007...really captured the feeling of being there all over again. Very good price,too-and delivery faster than anticipated. If you are an Incubus fan, you want this dvd. If not, why would you buy it in the first place? To write a crappy review and be doggin' my boys? Love Incubus. There's no such thing as bad Incubus."
5,Adore this DVD!!!,This DVD is great!!! The extra clips between the songs are fun and entertaining. The song clips are visually stimulating too
1,Bad shippment,"I haven't received my dvd yet, i don't know what happened... how can i complain about this?"
1,a failure,"I watched a tango concert by Rinaldi in the 80 ties, when this cd was recorded.In this concert she sang Piazzolla and Piaf (La Foule: translated) which was very impressing.Unfortunately the synthesizerstrings used on this cd make it into a cheapish Asian restaurant background music. Furthermore the singer seems wanting to show off her knowledge of other languages than her native Spanish (Argentinian) As a result she jumps over syllables in German and French, destroying the tender balance between pathos and subtility needed in tango. I feel the producer was asleep during the recording sessions.Very bad indeed"
2,tweeters,"I am a thrifty buyer and I saw these tweeters for sale I previously had some pyle tweeters and thought this would be a good upgrade, but unless you have a car that has an absolutely powerful these speakers emit such a high frequency that it mutes out the rest of you system. I would recommend something with an adequate RMS level that matches the total power output."
5,"I was skeptical, but, now I'm a ccw convert","Use tips from the novelists? Let my computer measure my results? Sure.So I bought this book with a skeptical eye. Once I tried the business about editing to the five number standards, I thought it felt mechanical. But I stuck with it.And what do you know? I soon began to feel an attitude change. I did write better in the first hour, just as promised.Bottom line, and I should have put this into the top line, if I'd taken the author's advice: This is the best book on writing since the Elements of Style. Don't take my word for it. Use it and see for yourself."
4,Battling Divas,"This is a funny movie. I loved Suzanne Pleshette as the rich, snooty mother-in-law, and Debbie Reynolds is always a pleasure to watch regardless of her role. Both ladies are so talented, but neither was upstaged by the other. As always, Suzanne Pleshette was the fashion diva with her ""high maintenance"" wardrobe; Debbie Reynolds was the always down to earth, personable one. I've watched this movie several times, and I always laugh and cry."
4,"Manager of the ""Honey Do"" list!","As the Manager of the critical ""Honey Do"" list that insures peace and tranquility for Life in the Castle, I need a great set of tools to get the job done. As my current tools have some age on them their performance is somewhat in question and that puts me in some peril. It has been a pleasure to launch project after project using such a reliable and powerfull tool like the Factory-Reconditioned DeWalt DW958K-2R 18-Volt 3/8"" Cordless Compact Drill/Driver Kit. Even as a novice I have been able to bring light to the Knights, brace up items that were Dragon and rescue the Damsel before the castle was seized by Dis Repair. I owe my Kingdom and life of leisure to the increatible power of the Factory-Reconditioned DeWalt DW958K-2R 18-Volt 3/8"" Cordless Compact Drill/Driver Kit. With the magic of this tool I will live happily ever after. Thank you Merlin for favors granted!"
3,Predictable,"Tired stuff it is, especially given this day and age. Most skits were very predictable. Only highlight was the takeoff on the Honeymooners."
2,"It's NOT SNL, so don't expect much","I guess I have to admit I was expecting more from this show. The fact the props and background scenery is nothing more than what a high school production can accomplish could be overlooked if the writing was up to par. The sad fact is that it isn't, for me at least. When the LOGO label appeared I truly expected something more, but ended up seeing something way less. Maybe growing up with the brilliance of SNL's early days made me jaded against this, who knows... It is at least worthy to know it is attempted as a ""gay"" show.... I won't be purchasing season 2."
4,"Drags at start,but mid-book,a pageturner.","I found Dee Brown's book on this military history to drag a bit at the start,but by the middle of the book I was pulled in by the intensity and detail of his research. A vivid and brutal account of the way of the west in the mid-19th century. From the cunning stealth and strength of the leader Red Cloud,to the meticuliousness and orderly fashion of Colonel Henry Carrington, who through him and sub-ordinates(Fetterman) misdecisions,led to an combined victory of Sioux,Cheyenne,and Arapaho. Dee Brown's detail and account of this pre-cursor event to Custer,should be read by every sincere western historian."
5,Excellent,"Great music to listen to. Love the song selection and the way they were put together. Relax, throw back and sip a glass of wine while you enjoy the melodies."
4,"Not quite horror, but definitely good!","I thought it was more like... action, suspence with a little gore. The story line is pretty good and if you like a twist this one is perfect. They used some pretty good props and the graphics weren't bad either. Some of the makeup could have improved but whatever. It will keep you wondering till about 15 minutes from the end... good stuff."
3,not bad,"just watched e movie in e theatersnot badinteresting storylinehmmm not exactly a horror movie rather a serviceable sci-fi thrillere lead male, mike vogel is pretty gdv believable"
3,Cheesy Fun,As far as the 8 films to die for series goes this one rates among the better ones. It has it's story and sticks to it. The acting is actually very good and the story kept me interested. The movie does get a wee bit on the cheesy side towards the end and I fee like there was some missed potential with this concept but it was definitely well worth the watch. My biggest complaint is how stupid the monsters look. I really feel like they could have done a whole bunch more with them if they had taken to time. But if my only complaint is that the monsters are stupid then I think the movie did a pretty good job especially for a low budget film. If you get the chance to see this I don't think you will be disappointed.
2,slick but cheesy,"The premise of this movie was good. In fact, the first two thirds of the film kept me interested in trying to solve the mystery behind Ian Stone's ""reincarnations"", so to speak. Unfortunately, the main villainess reminded me so much of Lara Flynn Boyle's character in Men in Black 2 that I had a hard time taking her seriously. Plus her compatriots looked like Matrix knock-offs. Bottom line: very cool idea that spiraled toward a hokey climax."
3,"A good book, it could have been better","This was an okay book, I really felt the information could have been presented in a better way.Someone felt ""cute"" layout and font changes on every page would make a good presentation style for this book, I found that it made information difficult to track and the overall style was confusing. Once I was able to decipher the information, it was very good, and very helpful!One additional warning - the majority of the book was dedicated to male attire. Women had their own section, but, it was a chapter (with assorted extra nuggets of information elsewhere), not a full half of the book."
4,Fashion Advice for Beginners,"This is the sort of book one gives to new grads, people re-entering the workforce, people starting a new job in a different company/region/field/etc. Lots of visuals, which is always a good thing in fashion advice books. Some of the printed info could have been better arranged. (The creators need to sit down with all three of Edward Tufte's books.) The type face of some pages was waaaaaay too small!Another thing. This isn't really a book for women. The section containing advice for women is just thirty pages out of a total of 174. (hmm.)Still, I'm glad I bought it a few years back. It has lots of good, basic info on clothing construction, fabric, color, classic style, etc., none of which has dated at all.(Actually, I think I need to re-read it.)"
3,Decent book about fashion,"This book is a very good primer into the area of formal dress.As an earlier reviewer said, there are a lot of allusions to the 1940's, because the authors feel that the '40s are the last decade when the common man actually dressed well. I disagree, but let'sa move on.As the title says, the book is about clothes one may wear to work. There are a lot of great combinations and a few that are horrendous. But, that is to be expected in a book about an area as subjective as fashion.I would also say that the book should have specified that it is for both men and women. It is a bit disappointing to buy a book, only to see that half of it is entirely inapplicable to me.This is a decent book for those who want to start learning about style and how to match clothes into combinations. I recommend it, but just barely."
3,"Better, but not great","Much better than the same authors' ""Dress Smart Men"" in the Chic Simple series. Presents a variety of clothing combinations, many actually useful. Would have been better if it had been seperated into one book for men and one for women -- half the book is useless."
3,useful tool--for reading not writing legislation,"This is a very useful tool for someone who needs to read and understand federal bills. It may also help remind (at least moderately experienced) drafters of the things to watch for when drafting legislation. (Although the author's occasional pompousness can be distracting.) However, if you have never drafted a bill before, this book will probably be somewhat less than useful. So I think it's a useful reference-if perhaps not for the reasons the author intended.Have your office buy it for you. I would not spend my own money on this."
5,Comprehensive and insightful,"Miss Popeil has obviously spent a great amount of time and effort in assimilating and putting together vocal concepts, that are so elusive when put in the hands of other misinformed teachers. She explains things very clearly and simply so that the layperson is able to understand. One can see that she has great passion in her singing and teaching! Her video is just the thing for those who have been frustrated in being typecast as a singer of a particular genre of music. This video is the tool to help one to be a balanced and versatile singer!"
3,It's just like the others...not better...not worst,"I did a taste test on over 12 brands of bbq sauce.I had to get Cattlemen's online as it was not available locally.In my opinion ....#1 was Jack Daniel's orig recipe #7#2 was Sweet Baby Ray's with Hickory.#3 was Bulls EyeI had seen on the food channel where Cattlemen's was the brand used by most restaurants.Cattlemen's wasn't bad ... could have been number 4 ... I do not know, I was only looking for #1Note that 1 and 2 have their own taste.Number three (Bulls Eye) and the others have a similar taste to each other and I picked Bull Eye as the best of the rest (which tasted similar to each other)"
1,Too late for my Book Club,"The book itself is great but the service from the bookseller was not satisfactory. In preparation for my December Book Club meeting, I ordered this book on Nov. 28. I contacted Amazon and the bookseller early in December and was told it had been sent. During several emails I was given instructions but no book. My Book Club came and went and still no book. I finally received it on Jan 8 sporting a Jan 6 postmark. I was not happy but hope that I do not have similar delays on future books. I will not be ordering from that bookseller again. I have had wonderful service from other Amazon sellers and look forward to working with them in the future."
5,Hard Times is an exceptional book,"Hard times lyrically explains life in the early 1800's while captivating its readers and showing that hard times hits people of all eras, decades, and even surpasses those of 1800's to the 1990's. However, what is most intriguing is the fact that Charles Dickens in some aspects suggest that sometimes hard times are circumstances that we subject ourselves and others to and whether is under ones own volition or under false pretenses. Hard Times is indeed a knowledgeable novel that teaches a lesson and shows one of many Dickens attributes. This review is from Merci McKinley who is 16 years old from Potomac High School in Oxon Hill, Maryland."
3,greatness,It was a pretty good book. It made me realize what life was like back in dickens' time. The industrial revolution was going on... It started off pretty slow than got exciting as I read on. I encourage young readers to think about reading this book.
4,"tapp,s love for the gospel",there needs to be more content on evangelist casears work and it needs to be a way to view her see it as well as see it can you down load samples of her work to see and hear by any p.c player that has visual as well a s hear samples.
2,Ending is a mess,"I enjoyed The Child Queen very much. Fairly standard Arthur fare. The High Queen was in much the same vein, and was enjoyable until the end. Unfortunately, McKenzie decided to make Mordred noble and likable. Then she had to figure out how to make this noble and likable character fulfill the prophecy of killing his father. The ending made no sense compared to the rest of the book - it just seemed like a slapstick comedy with horrible results."
1,Guinevere is a pitiful and weak character,"This book is so sappy that ever page you turn just makes you want to drop the heavy weight book down and puke. If you like reading about a weak, horrid, dull, whiny, annoying and above all...pitiful female character with no soul, passion, or feelings but greed, this is the book for you.The High Queen is one of the worst books on King Arthur and his court I have ever read. There are other more time worthy titles on Guinevere out, just keep searching."
1,I was Very Dissapointed,"I expected so much more, I mean, after the great first book THE CHILD QUEEN, I just HAD to read the sequel. Thing is, I wish I never did start. Okay, so Arthur dies, and Guinevere starts crying her eyes out, but other than the visible notions, it seemed as though nothing happened at all emotionally. Nancy Mckenzie has lost the respect I had given her for such a great book and writing of the first, but this has just backed down my praises of her. I hope she comes out with another book, and this time, lay off with sequels, they are not her type of thing."
1,WORTH NO STARS,"I just don't understand this books series: DelRay Disovery? I don't think so...this book is far less of a discovery than it's first book. What type of perverse plot is this?! A woman who's son who's half her age who falls in love with her and wants to become her king? Gosh... I should have read another novel. Not only was this book big (and I mean big) but it was so boring. No action or romance that the average fantasy lover looks for, I'd give no stars, but that's not an option is it?"
2,Sunk Like the Titanic,"This whole feminist thing is erupting again. Oh, female author takes a girl-view of an old story. I'm a female, but reading this book made me feel so worthless, which is why I'm giving it another star, for being able to change my emotion. The book started off decently, but towards the end it bombed."
1,How typical,"Can this author take another English course? First of all, the title is so... unoriginal. Second, the title is so...unoriginal. Third... the plot was the typical arthur/Guinevere story. Four... why did I even bother to finish this book?"
4,It was good but...,"I liked this book, and it's prequel, The Child Queen, but this was one of the first King Arthur books I've read, and since (I think) mostly all the others out there make Guinevere a bad, sinning, horrid queen, causing Arthur much trouble, I don't think I'll be able to stand it. If I read how traitorous she was, I'll keep on referring back to this book and just probably end up pissed off that the other authors would make her such a disagreeable character compared to this Guinevere (if that wasn't too confusing to understand). So the bad thing was that this book has made me biased towards other Guinevere characters. Though Guinevere cried quite a bit, it was an intreguing book and the characters were interesting. The ending was so sad...everytime I reread this book I have to skip the ending or else I'll get too sad!"
5,an excellent sequel,"After The Child Queen, I was sure the sequel was going to be a disappointment. I was wrong! The High Queen lives up to the promise of The Child Queen. Granted, the first chapter drags a little, but once you get past that the author plunges right back in with adventure, drama, romance... and most of all, characters that make the Arthurian legend come to life."
5,Wonderful.,"I read The High Queen after having read The Child Queen (it's prequel) and I could not put either book down. I am normally a very slow reader, but I got through these books faster than I have any others. I admit that McKenzie's books are not ""high art,"" but as someone who is enthralled by the Arthurian legend, I found them immensley enjoyable. McKenzie writes so that the reader often feels as though she were in the novel. I certainly found this to be true. McKenzie's descriptions of the characters and events stayed mostly true to the traditional legend while still ""humanizing"" Arthur, Guinevere, Lancelot, and all the rest. The characters became people rather than just bits and pieces of the legend. Again, I have read plenty of other books with more symbolism, meaning, and ""depth,"" but I have enjoyed no others to the extent of The Child Queen and The High Queen. I really wish McKenzie would publish another book; I would love to read it."
5,love this,This stethescope is better than any litman I have had. No outside noise and the patients love it. I will buy it again as needed and worth every penny.
3,good starter stethoscope,i bought this stethoscope while in nursing school as my first stethoscope purchase because i liked the appearance and other reviews i read. heart sounds can be heard well on this product but lung sounds are not as easily distinguished. they are very muffled and i find it difficult to hear. i would rather have bought a littman from the start.
4,Nice but bulky,The heart shaped bell is adorable but I have found that it's a bit larger than it appears in the picture and not too lightweight. I can hear lung and heart sounds very cleary. This stethoscope is sold for a bargain of a price.
1,I SCOPED OUT THE CLEAR HEART STETHOSCOPE X 2,"I ordered this stethoscope through Amazon and was very happy with it for two weeks. (I am a Respiratory Therapist) Then one day I placed the CLEAR RED HEART on a patient's chest to listen to breath sounds and my eyes saw a terribly chipped and cracked RED HEART. I had no idea how it had been damaged. I contacted Amazon & sent it back and they had a brand new one back in my hands in less than a week. Three days later, I was cleaning it off with alcohol after a ""CODE-BLUE"" and the RED HEART chipped and cracked right infront of my eyes with red flakes popping off the surface of the HEART and several deep cracks penatrating half way through the entire heart. The plastic must not be tolerant to alcohol. I returned it to Amazon for a refund.Prestige Medical Clear Sound Heart Stethoscope, Black"
2,Cute but not good for real diagnostics,"Very cute stethoscope, but not recommended for any clinician that is interested in auscultating without having to guess. It would be a great gag gift or even sufficient for pediatric patients. Not recommended for patients with various co-morbidities. I wouldn't spend more than $19.99 or less on this product."
2,Looks cheery,Very cute stethascope but if you've ever used a Cardioscope Classic you will be disappointed. Can't hear heart and lung sounds clearly due to all the external noise.
2,Save your money,"Regardless of it being cute and light, the ear buds crack easily, the head is a bit too big and the acoustics are def. not the best"
3,Jury still out,"I was hoping I would like this, but I am not sure yet. I thought when I initially used it, it worked ok, but the more I used it I realized I couldn't hear with it as well as I would like. I find myself going back to my old 1. The head (heart) is large and it is sort of hard to get it in the right place on small arms. I also notice that when I am holding it to listen to a BP that there is a lot of noise (which is from me holding it in place)"
4,good stethoscope with a drawback,"I do really like the sound quality of this stethoscope but, it did crack when I bumped into the door in my patient's room. The sound is still very good but, I do not know how long it will last cracked."
3,This a mediocre stethescope,I bought this when i lost my masters litman stethoscope I work on a cardiac unit and it was difficult at times to hear heart sounds and breath sounds clearly but maybe in a another field it would be a better choice. I would rate this as ok but didn't impress me overall its cute but I needed better clarity to do my job.
2,Cute but broke within days,"I bought this item for the looks. I work Med/Surg as an RN. Acoustics were moderate in rating, I have used better sounding stethoscopes. This item was not abused in any way, but cracked in 3 places on the head within days of purchase. Dissatisfied customer. I would recommend an Ultrascope--Better acoustics, more expensive but better quality."
2,cute but not a good stesthoscope,"It definitely is the cutest stethoscope out there but it is harder to hear sounds, hard to use because the head (heart) it is too big and because it is acrylic it cracked within a couple of weeks. I am buying a Littman now."
5,Daughter Loved it!!!!!!!!!!!,Made my daughter's day and she loved it. She is studing to be a nurse taking courses even in High Shool.
4,Great!,This is loved by both my patients and the staff they couldnt believe the great price I was given for such a good product.
2,ok,Its styleish ... But the heart is wayyyy thicker then it looks and does not fit under blood pressure cuff ... Im so disappointed. Im saving up to buy a new one ...you can hear very well but i need it to fit its almost 2 inches thick (the heart )
1,Started off wonderful...,"This stethoscope was just what I needed. I could hear manual BPs with ease and lung sounds clearly. Unlike other stethoscopes, it did not feel like it was placing a strain on my neck. Plus my patients always had a pleasant comment about it. Well less than 3 months after receiving it, I bent over to get my pen and it fell from around my neck. Well the heart cracked off and flew across the room. There was no repairing it. The metal portion ( which I guess was aluminum) that was embedded in the heart made a clean break. I am saddened and disappointed in the quality. It was nice while it briefly lasted."
1,Bad Sound quality,"I purchased this based on the reviews and was very disappointed. Sound quality was horrible. Maybe I received a defective item. I'll be purchasing a Littman, hopefully those review are more accurate."
5,Awesome!,"This product was perfect! It works exactly as advertised, looks great and gets plenty of attention. It actually helps me with my patients by gaining their trust through their curiosity and it helps lesson the anxiety often felt by patients in an emergency situation. I would recommend this to anyone looking for an exceptional stethoscope!"
2,STETHOSCOPE EVAL,FYI..This scope is good for manual BP's. It is a great conversation piece and patients love it.Acoustically I give it a low rating. It is very difficult to hear crackles on the resp assessment + difficult w cardiac.Not a good choice if you are an advanced clinician.
1,good for nothing,"The chest piece is massive and it doesn't sit well on very many surfaces such as a slender arm. But what is worse is that the sensitivity is terrible compared to a standard stethoscope. Even with my good hearing, it was almost impossible to clearly hear a heartbeat. I was very disappointed with this product."
1,Dont get it $$:(,"They didn't send me the heart stethoscope but a normal looking one! They got the color right , but i could gotten that from the next door store! cheaters"
3,"Nice, but you get what you pay for","This is a nice stethoscope but like the saying goes... ""you get what you pay for."" I am going to buy one that lays flat on the skin, this one doesn't lay flat on the skin. Very cute... I guess don't pick a stethescopes like a pair of shoes.. LOL."
4,Great gift for someone in the medical field :-),I don't know about the quality of this product in terms of actual functioning as it was bought as a present for someone who was starting a position in Peds. But that person told me it worked fine and the kids loved it! The price for this item on amazon was the best I'd seen anywhere.
2,Prestige medical stethoscope,I loved the price of this stethoscope but soon realized why it was so cheap when the glass encasing the bell on it cracked within a couple of days. Definitely not a good deal. You are better off with the more expensive Littman.
1,Poor qaulity--don't be fooled,"After reading the reviews, I chose this scope. I was terribly disappointed! I could not pick up anything...just an extremely vague thump sound--sometimes! It was no better than a toy in my opinion. I have returned it and plan to buy another scope. How anyone can say they got great use out of this is beyond me!"
3,It's alright,"I LOVED the product when I first received it but after about a month or so of sitting on my dresser untouched the plastic part, the heart, began to crack. However that hasnt affected hearing on this product. It's still a good quality product considering the price. If you're willing to spend the extra money, your money would be much better spent on a Littman."
4,Gift for my heart,I love this stethoscope. Its exactly what I wanted. All the reveiws are dead on- the sound quality is great as well as the price.
4,High quality pillow at great price,"I am extremely pleased with this pillow by Sealy Posturepedic. I love how the fill is evenly distributed, no pillow-fluffing needed! Very fluffy, comfy and firm. Perfect for a back sleeper such as myself."
4,Sequel to VIRGINS -- Catholic schools girls enter real world,"Read VIRGINS first -- especially if you're like me and own amug that reads ""I Survived Catholic School.""Thecharacters are ABSOLUTELY credible ... if you doubt this, you didn't survive Vatican II with the rest of us. Although I'm a tad younger than the protagonists, I related with them from the first page of VIRGINS right through the end of GIRLS FOREVER, BRAVE AND TRUE.I stumbled on this web site looking for more Caryl Rivers fiction, and was disappointed to find the story of Peg, Con, and Sean hasn't been extended to their lives as grandparents!"
5,Bueno,"It is not necessary to get this if you buy the crusher, you can easily engineer something yourself. That being said it works well, and comes with a fancy American flag decal. We were disappointed there wasn't a Texas flag decal, but it's all good."
2,Kind of small,"This product might be useful where there is not enough space to keep a larger receptacle for recycling. Eventually, though, this will be emptied into a larger bin (preferably one with a bag to block ants). When the bag is full, it will be taken to the recycling center or (like me) stored until Earth Day comes around in April of next year for double the going price on aluminum cans. This container would best be used with diet soda cans only (and rinsed often) in a small environment before being dumped in a larger bin."
4,Very Cool Recycling Bin,"Very Cool. Husband got the can crusher for Christmas & wanted the collection bin. He thinks it's so cool!! It looks good, too."
2,No Way,I have purchased this item twice now thinking the first time maybe the batch was old or something....The price is great but the smell of this product is horrible. I will never buy this again....if you can handle the smell the product does get rid of the hot-flashes.
5,Really like this Progesterone Cream,"I have taken Progesterone in various creams and drops, and had negative reaction to all of them. This one keeps my hot flashes at bay, and I don't have any negative reactions. It absorbs easily, too. Some other creams, that I have tried, took a lot of effort to rub in."
4,Great album for Paradise Lost and Type O fans!,"I heard the song LOVE INFERNAL on some radio station and was immediately thrilled by the sound of Poisonblack. I ordered the album directly from amazon. The songs on this great album incorporates all that we love about the catchiest songs Paradise Lost and Type O Negative have unleashed upon the world. Poisonblacks premiere release is as good as HIM but heavier. If you like melodic metal and the above mentioned bands, invest in this album."
4,good book,this is a book that is meant for beginers in the art of marquetry. i have 8 years experiance in the art. i did learn a little bit from the book.i would recommend it to anyone who is interested in learning marquetry.i would also recommend getting Paul Schurchs book and video and Marc Adams book and videos.
4,Great for creative ideas,The projects inside are explained well and it really enlightens the creative spirit to expound on the examples in the book.
3,Nice pic to use on any method,It has good pic but found method not to my liking. I like cutting on a bevel to get tight fitting pices.
1,Not an American book,"I ordered this book last week in hopes of learning Marquetry. Well, little did I know that this book wasn`t written by an American in plain English, it is written by 2 Englishmen who reference things we are not familiar with in this country.. If you know your millimeters, centimeters and metrics you will be fine with the measurements.....but this book doesn`t even tell you that PVA glue is the old school Elmers glue. Another thing is the vagueness in which they teach......""keep the knife 2 degrees to the vertical""....which probably means tilt it 2 degrees. Oh, and the biggest complaint.....this book is about making furniture and what not.....why couldn`t the whole book be about teaching just Marquetry?? ....anyway, I`m sorry I bought this."
3,highly satisfactory-wish I had it again!,"i am sorry that this product is currently unavailable, since I would have liked to reorder it! it was highly satisfactory!Please e-mail me when you have it back in stock."
5,"Great Book, Truth About Healthy Sunlight.","Teaches the truth about sunlight; the eyes, body need sunlight, pure full spectrum, containing all lightwaves, healthy balanced light, NOT filtered through eyeglasses, contact lenses, sunglasses, windows. Sunlight improves health of the eyes, brain, body and clarity of eyesight. I refer this Authors work to Natural Eyesight Improvement students. Practice sunning, go outside in the sun daily."
4,Good information!,The book shares pertinent information about the importance of light - good light - full spectrum daylight for humans. Am replacing all lighting to daylight throughout the house.
1,Very disappointed,The caliper came the next day which was awesome. Once opened I realized the bracket around the banjo bolt was not angled correctly but not a big deal. Installed the caliper no problems bled the lines drove the car around maybe 2 weeks on my way home from work I lost all brake pedal luckily wasn't going fast made it home pulled tire off and noticed brake fluid in my fender well and all over back side of tire the reservoir was still full . The caliper was completely rusted over and fluid was leaking around the cam boot where parking nut is located had to buy a new caliper from a local store to make it to work the next morning. All in all very disappointed in this product always been a raybestos fan now I'm a little hesitant on future purchase's of there products I have a $70 paperweight in my garage now
5,Hilarious!,"How can you not love a book that takes potshots at the authors of ""The Canon"" (the dating bible that tells women to dimwitted and hard to get) and ""Xanax Planet"" (the memoir of self-absorption and medication)? You don't need to be a girl who once toiled in ""whoo hoo we're gonna change the world"" dotcom hell to love Miss Media. But, uh, if you are, you will! Truthfully, anyone who's ever had to navigate a workplace full of smiling villains and cretins will get a kick out of this comic novel. And anyone who's ever had a crush, enjoyed a Breakup Girl column or hung out with a very witty girlfriend will like spending time with Lola Somerville. This book's so good, it should have a Ben & Jerry's flavor named after it."
2,"Two Stars for the Bugs, only","Let me get this straight: Global warming is responsible for weird bugs that lay eggs in a defrosted 20,000 year old Mastodon and then burrow into anyone who gets near them. That's the hook, by the way. How they sold this to the studio, I don't know. The characters were completely undeveloped. The plot was non-existent. Val Kilmer is still fat, albeit a good actor. And the bug effects were good. So it gets two stars for the bugs, with the help of Kilmer's limited exposure in the role. That's it. If you want the real deal, watch Carpenter's ""The Thing."" That one received - and well deserved - the five stars I awarded it...and not just for the special effects."
3,Thaw,"I found it somewhat boring. Interesting concept using the backdrop of global warming. The sex scene was nice. Plenty of gore. If you like Cabin Fever, The Thing, Quarantine, Splinter then this is for you."
3,An eco-version remake of the thing,"This is much like The Thing, although it is updated to include global warming and the possible resulting catastrophes that go along with melting the ice caps and organisms which may be underneath them. Val Kilmer is not used much here, but the rest of the cast is good enough for the rather simple story."
4,The Thaw,"Ghost House Pictures have been releasing some very good stuff and this one surely made it worth the time to watch.I think more previews should be shown on the ghost house pictures, a horror fan such as myself I would love to own more of them, very good horror stuff, keep'em comingThe Thaw."
3,Good movie to watch late at night,I just watched the film and thought it was creepy because bugs always give me the scare. I thought the movie could of been better if they would of went in to more detail with the Mammoth and bugs finding cures or something for the problem at hand. Also something I did not care for was the Global warming message that kind of drove me away also. It seems this movie was made for just that reason saying it was man made. Al Gore must of gotten some money from it!
3,"Creepy, crawly eco-horror","The Ghost House Underground line of direct-to-DVD releases continues for a second year, only this time around we only get four films compared to last year's eight. The most notable of which is The Thaw, which boasts some pretty decent production values and some chilling scares as well. Martha MacIsaac (Superbad and The Last House on the Left) stars as the daughter of an environmental scientist (Val Kilmer) who accompanies a small group of students to a remote location where her father has discovered a well-preserved frozen woolly mammoth, and the parasitic bugs that lay dormant inside it as well. Naturally, it isn't long before said bugs are on the loose and spreading. Packed with gross-out moments and some brief shots of gorgeous cinematography, The Thaw is surprisingly good and definitely creepy. It doesn't offer anything you haven't seen before in any random horror flick, but for what it's worth, The Thaw is worth a look."
2,Global warming,"This movie had potential, but falls short. Val Kilmer had a small part and I think he must have just lent his name and on screen face time as a favor to the writer or director, or the guy is just hard up for work. This is a limited film and spends most of its time harping on global warming. It has its good points but more nap time moments and of course no skin shots at all which would have at least held my interest. Worth watching but not buying, rent if you can."
4,A Nightmare Spawned from Global Warming,"It's definitely a warning of warming...global that is. This Ghost House Underground contribution is a sci-fi wake-me-up with realistic undertones. It asks us...how long will we ignore the threat of ignoring our environment/climate. This film will definitely get under your skin...literally. And it was nice to see Val Kilmer back on the screen in a dramatic role...as one of the few experts trying to educate the populace of GW. Well worth a view for both horror and sci-fi fans...but look at the box closely. If you have a phobia for bugs, you may not want to watch this alone."
2,Should have been more and bigger but with get almost nothing..,"When you hear the words Global Warming so many times at the beginning...ithing that a special group paid for this film. The film is pretty goodfor what it is,,, but seems to be missing important elements...like moreeffects...more gore...bigger creatures...etc...etc.Some of the special effects shots where the creatures are shown...you haveto look twice...as they are soo small...They also put the weight of the ending on the back of a young rooky filmstar that i dont even know...that too took away a bit of the film.So its a good film for what it is...but something is missing and the filmends up paying for it..... I like Val Kilmer...but in here...its only fora paycheck...and he looks overfeed."
1,Horrible,"OMG this was such a bad political movie. Man is responsible for killing the planet so he deserves to die by roach infestation. This was the theme of this movie. About a third of the way thru, I was begging for the Orkin man to show up and spray my DVD player to end my suffering."
5,Kids learn with every song!,"I came across this tape in my school's resource room and my 1st graders love it! Some of the songs are more for kindergarten or even pre-K, but my kids LOVE the title song and have made up their own using rhyming words, which has been great!They also LOVE the Weekly Rap...they literally (eek!) go nuts over it! Kudos to Hap, I will have to check out his others!"
5,Terrific character development with a whodunit bonus,"I've never written a review before -- this book inspired me to do so. I was drawn in completely; I cared about the characters, I could visualize them, they were unique (not stereotypes), they drove me crazy sometimes, but they were never ""out of character."" The mystery aspect of this book is neat but the story and characters hold up without the need to know ""whodunit."" And I liked that there was minimal violence and gore. Ms. Patrick has a straightforward, intelligent writing style. This book is impressive -- especially as a first novel!"
5,Titans clash on K2!,Most mountaineering books chronicle successful ascents. Rowell offers an even more fascinating study in the failure of an expedition plagued by titan egos: famous mountaineers proving themselves no gods. The photography is... breathtaking!
4,Battery life,"I purchased the Olympus SP 570UZ last month. This past weekend I took it out for the really the first time.I do like the camera, however I was extremely disappointed with the life of the battery. I actually had to buy 4 sets of additional AA batteries to get through the weekend.And therefore I was unable to take as many picture as I would have liked to. I saw that somebody wrote that he took 600 picture with a set of batteries. Well, I never got past 250."
3,"pictures are good, the camera needs improvement","i have this camera for 13 months already and i have taken it on 4 long trveling periods. this past tour two pieces of felt/rubber that are supposed to make your hold of the camera comfortable started falling off.on another occasion the little door that holds the xd card got open while i was wlking. i dont know how long i was wlking this way before i realised it was open. in my case the card didnt fall out but you never know it might have fallen and i would have lost all my pictures ( about 600).unfortunatly my warranty has just expired but if you are thinking of buying a camera that starts falling apart after 12 month, i would suggest looking at the other makes. maybe they dont have rubber pieces that will fall off after a short use.i bought it as soon as they came out with the 18 optical zoom. if i would have bought one today i would probably go for the fuji 8100 because it takes 2 kinds of cards as opposed to the olympus which takes only the xd card."
4,Great simple camera that does A LOT,"Bought this camera for my wife a few years back, and she loves it. So much so that when she dropped her camera and broke it I bought her a newer version and she just wanted this one back. It does so much"
3,not under warranty,"I couldn't download the pictures from this camera, when I sent it in to Olympus for warranty work they said because I tried to take off the sticky label and didn't finish, it voided my warranty. The problem was in the USB port of the camera which wouldn't recognize the computer connection.I have used this model camera for about 3 years now, it's a great camera. It does need work on the stabilization feature as the further you zoom, the steadier you must keep the camera. I believe I will upgrade to the SP800."
5,Nice camera,"I bought this as a gift for my wife. In exchange I got her older camera. Bottom line - if you want to be treated well by your lady, get this camera."
2,Battery Hog,"This model is my third Olympus. My old ones have superior battery life but not this one. It's batteries need a recharge after 35 images, max, although I don't use the large viewer and turn off the anti-shake. Then I have to charge them 2 or 3 times to get them to work. I was using Sony and Energizer 2500Mah with poor results, so The company accepted it back as flawed. The replacement is the same. I then ordered the Olympus charger and batteries recommended for this camera, and they are no better. What's funny is, my daughters Canon Supershot (same Mpix, anti-shake, large videos) worked fine on my ""spent"" batteries.A lot of ""noise"" is evident in images taken in low light. The high ISO which is supposed to help in low light, actually makes it worse.All my Olympus cameras are well made and easy to use, though the internal battery died in one after 3 years, so I have to redo my settings every time I change the battery. There are better cameras out there. I wish I'd gotten something else."
4,Great value for a good camera,"I purchased the 550UZ mainly for pix of birds in my backyard and family snaps. Overall, I'm pleased with the quality and performance of the camera. However, a tripod is a must when using the fully extended tele. Being an old film and winder guy, I find the myriad of settings and instructions just a wee confusing. Otherwise, the price (less than $400), long lens, and remote triggering met my expectations."
5,"9 out of 10..... great, versatile camera!","Can't say enough about this camera..... & I still have a lot to learn about it. Just got it about a month ago, & went on a Caribbean cruise last week. I have some beautiful pictures with this thing.... wide shots, close-ups with the ridiculously impressive zooming capability, gorgeous sunrise shots, super blues & greens in the beach shots, etc. I'm sure I'll write more or post some shots in the coming weeks, but for now just wanted to tell you that this is a fantastic camera & the best buy you can make for the money, hands down. Get one!"
3,Olympus SP 550UZ 7.1,"The Olympus SP 550UZ 7.1 is not that good. The Auto focus didn`t work. I have 3 other Olympus digital cameras, and the auto focus didn`t that well either, sometimes it would work and other times it didn`t and for that kind of monies, I think it should work ALL the time!! I read all the reviews on the Kodak P712, so I purchased the Kodak, and its awesome. I am real glad I did, so far its takes fantastic pictures. The auto focus is Great!!"
1,Olympus cameras will corrupt xD cards when using video.,"Olympus cameras will corrupt xD cards when using video. I sent an email which they ignored. I called and was told I had to send the camera back with the card, and a full explanation! I had to pay shipping (camera was 2 months old. They returned the camera and did nothing with the xD card. I called and spoke to a supervisor who said he would ship the card so would have it in 2 days! I got it 10 days later!Their service stinksOlympus SP-510 Ultra Zoom 7.1MP Digital Camera with Digital Image Stabilized 10x Optical Zoom"
1,This price is NOT a bargain.,I purchased this exact same Olympus camera one month ago for $100.00 cheaper at Sam's club here in Colorado.I paid $270.00. I will say that they sold very fast and they are out of stock here in Colorado.
3,"Nice camera, but the autofocus has a mind of its own.","I bought thus camera on the basis of its really useful zoom. Don't get me wrong, it's a nice camera. Everything feels solid and reliable, but the autofocus has a mind of its own.Unless the thing you focus on has 100% sharpness, the camera will focus on whatever is in the background (often hundreds of yards away) or at the feet of the object of interest, throwing out any chance of focusing in the object of interest.I can work round this issue, but is something you shouldn't have to do for the price (and so is something you should consider)."
4,Great camera,"I purchased this camera for my wife, to replace an Olympus 2100uz. This camera is slick looking and erganomics are great. The wide angle and telephoto are better than any other camera I know of. The slide show with music is impresive and battery life is great. We have had the camera for abour six weeks and haven't changed the batteries yet. The menua system is easy to use and very easy to understand. The only reason I gave it a 4 star is some times it takes a little time serching for auto focus."
2,This book in one word- GARBAGE!,"This book was a total waste of money. I wanted a book that would cover lots of information, but this is certainly an overkill. What else can you expect from Microsoft. However, a good point about the book is that it is a TRUE REFFERENCE book. There is an extensive index. However, for the average windows 95 user, who knows 95 well, this book goes to in depth. It is written for the network admin in mind. Reading is very dry. I was only looking for moderate depth coverage of topics. This book sucks."
1,A waste of money,"Another insult from Microsloth's Evil Empire! Barely worth the money, badly written and sloppy. I assume, Microsloth is expecting everybody who finds an error to pay for an update of the book"
2,microsoft nt workstation resource kit,"VERY POOR! If there was one thing that really got on my nerves about this book; it is the annoying habit of saying ""for more information see NT Concepts&Planning"" etc. I was trying to find out about user profiles and how to configure and set them up etc. This book gives very little information about it and informs you to buy another book. REALLY IRRITATING. CHOOSE ANOTHER BOOK ON WORKSTATION. You aren't missing anything!!!!"
3,Surgical Mayo Setups,"While helpful, I expected many more illustrations. Not every setup has diagrams included. This would be a definite plus."
5,THE DONNER PARTY,"THIS IS NORAH LOFTS ACCOUNT OF THE INFAMOUS DONNER PARTY OF AMERICAN HISTORY.IT IS WRITTEN AS ONLY SHE COULD WRITE, YOU ARE CAUGHT UP IN THE LIVES OF THE PEOPLE IN THE STORY & WHEN THE TRAGEDY STRIKES, YOU ARE STUNNED. MY FAVORITE STORIES BY NORAH LOFTS ARE THE ONES ABOUT ENGLISH HOUSES & THE PEOPLE WHO INHABITED THEM OVER THE CENTURIES, BUT EVEN THIS AMERICAN STORY OF HERS WAS WELL WORTH READING!!"
4,Good,"Overall, not a bad book.Does an excellent job of compiling all the ""arcane"" knowledge of how to plan for a LAN Party. Goes into some of the specifics of IP configurations, etc but leaves the reader hanging dry when it comes to managed switches and routers. I believe that the writer would have at least recommended some other books on the subject or maybe some online references.There are some very useful tips on how to keep your LAN Party guests entertained and I am sure to utilize them on a LAN Party being planned.Definitely an excellent reference for a ""noob"". Have fun!"
5,My parents love this book!,My parents truly enjoyed this book. They are new to the Fingerlakes area and absolutely love the history and plan on taking trips to see some of the sights mentioned in the book.
1,Poor quality control,Received new in box. Gauge was out of calibration way off 0 rectangle. Had to send back same day.
1,way too pricey for what you get.,"if you are new to yoga this in not the DVD set for you. an insightful lecture and quick demonstration, but not an instructional by any stretch of the word. Not worth the price tag as far as I'm concerned"
2,"Find the original VHS ""Grappler's Toolbox' series, if you can.","Sonnen made one big mistake: Many years ago, he put everything he knew into his first exercise video, the award-winning ""Grappler's Toolbox"". He's been trying convince us that he's come up with something new ever since. He hasn't."
5,Joey Dee Gets Wise??,I loved the clear - spare writing style. Those of us from N.Y. will really relate to the characters who offer quite a chuckle; And those of you who have been enthralled with the 'Sopranos' will find this a must read. Ms. Ermelino hits right on the button.
2,high tide is low tide!,I love Ian McShane! I loved him in Lovejoy and in some othermovies and he gives his all in this but this is not a movie!it's a tv series! Armchair thriller. and it's not very good.I love mysteries and horror but this was a short boring story.Try Con Man before this! I got on vhs and it's one of the bestmovies Ian ever made! unless you have to everything he made skip it!
3,They sound ok for what they are.,I wouldn't use these in a high end set up. They work ok in the dash of my 95 Incrapid. Cool that they come with bass blockers.
5,Excellent Book,"This book is amazing. It explains all the hormonal systems, gives the origin of hormonal problems and tells you what you can do to help yourself. It explain in depth about insulin , insulin resistance, female & male hormones...and a whole host of other issues. This book is excellent, I cannot say enough good things about it. The doctor writing it is very aware that the medical community does not have a lot of knowledge about how to treat hormonal disorders...this is itself is a breath of fresh air. This book has great diet recommendations, and gives you a lot of information on how to finally start taking control of your health."
5,"Hormonal Balance: Understanding Hormones, Weight, and Your Metabolism","A wonderful book that I will always keep. This is not just information that you have heard from other books, but up to date information on your hormones and metabolism. If you are having problems with weight gain and hormones then you won't waste your money on this one!"
4,Informative,"Very informative. Good technical information in easy to understand terms. Appears to be very thorough. However, his dietary recommendations are lacking. Good, healthy nutrition does not include such things like processed foods and artificial sweeteners. There is so much good nutritional information available that never made it into this book."
2,He's misinformed,"I was enjoying this book until I came upon the Thyroid section where he stated that natural thyroid meds, like Armour, are actually dangerous and should not be used if you can take a synthetic version, like Synthroid. He says the dosage in Armour varies and is inconsistent. This is not true, as many many people, including myself, take it everyday and feel great instead of taking the synthetic stuff.I was shocked to read that."
2,Doctor speak and incomplete diet,"While I found the book informative on some levels (it gave me a few ideas of tests to ask my doctor for) it was very full of technical jargon which was difficult, if not impossible, to slog through.The diet, while close to a good one, is incomplete. The limited proteins will leave you hungry no matter how many trips you make to the salad bar. And let's face it, without the dressing--you're only allowed two 1/8 tsps of oil per day--you're not eating dry salad for long. And no one is eating much more than two pieces of fruit a day without suffering the consequences. This is a one-size-fits-all diet for a population that is not all one size. My own minimum daily requirement of protein is 70 grams, which is more than this diet allows and I'm a small framed woman. With this diet, you can't help but lose weight. You'll be starving. You'll also lose a considerable amount of muscle mass."
2,Misleading information on progesterone and cause of PMS,"Isn't the lack of progesterone the actual cause of PMS and severe water retention, bloating and mental disruption? This book provides complete opposite information from what you would find from Dr. John Lee's book on the discussion of PMS."
2,Disappointing,"There's some medical information which you could find on the internet but it is disconnected by any theme. Also, the author claims that it is proved that high carbohydrate diets cause insulin resistance and diabetes.(pg76) He obviously hasn't read ""The China Study"" by T.C. Campbell. Nor has he read ""Mastering Leptin"" by B. Richards, otherwise he would not recommend snacking as a way to lose weight. There is a lot of information about drugs and supplements for serious illnesses which may not be useful to the reader looking for the hormonal connection to weight issues. For that read ""Mastering Leptin"" and ""The China study""."
1,Looks good. Isn't!,"This log basket is very thin sheet metal.It has no structural stability.The basket is warped and deformed, even before you put wood in it.Load it with wood and it collapses - totally useless junk!Very flimsy and poor construction."
3,You can find the jermaine stewart version!,"The Stewart version can be found on a disc called ""NOW! Thats what I call music, 1986"". It is a 2 disc set, that is hard to find, but it is out there."
5,A great musical saved by letterbox,"Oh, wow! This is a marvelous production that I saw as a one-day-only offering in a theater eons ago when I was a college student (in West Texas of all places). I loved it then, and other feedback does a decent job of saying ""why.""All I can add is this outstanding Broadway musical translated to the big movie screen extremely well, and then it almost disappeared from broadcast/cable TV -- and for reason. To much theatrical action and choreography was lost through cropping for the TV screen, and the magic was lost. (I only saw it listed once for TV before letterbox, and it was a mega disappointment).Even if you've never heard of it before, please consider this late 1960s-era musical comedy if you want to enjoy some solid entertainment."
4,Great Musical With a Great Storyline,"Not a fan of musicals specially those in film, but this was great gem to watch. I high recommend it, specially for those in the corporate world. Much of the storyline applies to modern times."
4,"A Secretary Is NOT a Toy, No, My Boy!","This movie's a kick, with a 60's flair for bold colors, goofy dances, and DEEP songs! Well, maybe not DEEP songs!Dick Van Dyke looking business men singing and dancing whacky tunes(""A Secretary Is NOT a Toy""), stereotypical ""Secretaries"" looking like my Barbie & Midge dolls from the 60's, all wrapped around the STARS of the show!THE STARS ... He's the dweeb who wants to quick-step up the ladder of success using a formula book for Succeeding in Business Without Really Trying. She's the cutie who's all business, bright, and by-the-book, but not HIS book!Our 14 year old daughter has watched this about 4 times, our 18 year old son laughs his way through the idiotically funny story, and our 7 year old niece dances all over the room whenever the movie kicks it into gear.We'd buy it again - we'll watch it again - and again. We like classic comedies and think this is one of the funnier ones to come out of the 60's."
5,Mayron57,"A superb movie and superb DVD transfer. I was so pleased to be able to pick up the original. I believe this film was remade a few years ago, in which case you can normally never again get the superior original version. Very pleased to get this. If you have a sense of humour, you will love this film!"
5,Movie great! DVD poor!,"The movie is one of the best. Robert Morse is simply spectacular. The songs are great! The DVD version is disappointing. Picture quality, not up to par. Also, it's in MONO, not STEREO. I suppose the original movie was MONO, but perhaps there is a master tape of the songs in STEREO. If so, I would have expected them to have been redubbed in stereo. Finally, only a widescreen version is on this DVD. I like it when both the widescreen and regular (panned and scanned) version are included."
3,Not Up To Par With The Stage Play,"""How to Succeed..."" on film is not a total disaster. There are some very good moments in it, such as Rudy Valee hamming it up in ""Grand Old Ivy"" and Robert Morse doing the same in ""Brotherhood of Man"" and ""I Believe in You"", but some moments in the film are completely uncalled for.Michelle Lee singing ""I Believe in You"" as a romantic song towards the end of the Act I absolutley ruined the sardonic, unromantic tone of the show. This scene, while only lasting three minutes, ruins the entire story and concept.Most of the songs sung by Lee's Rosemary from the stage play are also cut from the film, ruining her characther, turning her into a sympathetic romantic lead, not a tough as nails broad.Bud Frump is also given less to do here. His two big numbers are cut, making him more of a straightfoward antagonist than a comic villan.While Morse, Sammy Smith, Valee and Ruth Kobart are preserved wonderfully on the screen, the rest of the film flops rather badly."
2,Is there an echo in here?,I've never seen a book repeat so many of its images. Page after page of the same photos repeated over and over. I wasn't expecting that. The book is just okay. Nothing really new.
4,Searching for the Kingdom,"""Christianity is...the stubborn search for the kingdom of God, which involves heroism and sacrifice, and above all, the exhilaration of a journey into the unknown, ending in a marvelous discovery."" I adore crisp writing from authors who once were journalists...this one was for 45 years. The best thing is that Mr.Mathias' faith shines from every page, making this book a real gem."
5,Welcome and recommended reading,"A Short Course In Kindness by Margot Silk Forest (Founder of The Healing Woman, a non-profit organization for adults recovering from childhood abuse) is a thoughtful and thought-provoking collection of anecdotes, insights, humor, sadness, and wisdom about what true kindness is, and how to embrace and express it in our daily lives. A gentle and uplifting self-help book offering advice to sowing and reaping the blessings of good deeds, A Short Course In Kindness is welcome and recommended reading."
1,terribly terribly weak,"""Best alternate history stories""?? Barely readable as regular fiction, I suppose. But as alternate history fiction, completely worthless.The authors seemed to come up with their plots first, then fit their ""alternate histories"" to those plots by using clearly far-fetched events and assumptions and twisting logic wherever they need.If you're looking for depth of thought, exciting insights, or original ideas, look elsewhere.Worse, some stories, like the opening one ('The Lucky Strike'), are overflowing with political agenda, presented in a very one-sided fashion.This is a complete embarassment, especially for a book with such an ambitious name."
3,"For a century of stories, I was hoping for more","This was a good book...but I was disappointed that this was the best alternate history of the twentieth century. I think that there has to be something better out there. I read all of the stories, and I think that many of them weren't really alternate histories, strictly speaking. I like Harry Turtledove, but I guess there just isn't enough stories on this subject for this to be an incredibally good story set. It was fun, but not as good as expected."
4,twisted thoughts,"It is a very good book.Some of it may not be exactly A/H but it's close enough interesting enough and certainly written well enough by all of the authors to be called Very Good A/H.I won't go into detail about all of the story's because there is enough on the books page that describes it well, however I will say that I found Niven's ""All The Myriad Ways "" a disturbing but new way for me to look at parallel universes and good enough for me to say it is the best story in the book (to me)."
2,Forgetable,This is a perfect example of what happens when an author farms out his material. It was not good at all.
4,A Highly Enjoyable Collection,"Overall, this collection is great. I just tackled all of it in the past two nights. The only problems I have with it is that it isn't entirely made up of alternate history. At least half of it is time travel or alternate dimensions. While a few of these are still enjoyable, such as ""All the Miriad Ways"" and ""The Death of Captain Future"", they shouldn't be in the book. But this really isn't too bad, because most of us AH buffs are into Sci-Fi too.But, that's the only problem I have. I was brought to tears at the end of ""The Lucky Strike"", and am still pondering over ""Suppose They Gave a Peace"" and ""Manassass Again"". IF you like AH, you're probably gonna love it."
2,Not living up to its title,"They are not the best stories; in fact, some of them are quite boring. And not all of them are alternate history stories. What's alternate-historic or uchronic about ""The death of Captain Future""?. Besides, at least four of them have been published in other anthologies: Victorious Hitler, Dangerous Visions and Mirroshades; ""Bring the jubilee"", was published all by itself.All in all, a jumble of good, not so good, original and already-published, alternate or not, stories."
1,Have yet to receive the first issue,It has been a month since I purchased this magazine subscription and I have yet to receive the first issue.
2,Not one of Doyle's Better Works,"Conan Doyle started firmly believing in Sprirtualism late in his life and this story may have been an attempt to make people aware of it. The story is a typical Victorian novel using antiquated words which needs constantly looking up in a dictionary. It is not one of Conan Doyle's better works. It lacks imagination, wit and character development but there's only so much an author can do in 56 pages.SPOILER:The worst part about this story is the ending. It is one of the biggest anti-climaxes I have come across. It would be so very convenient for all heroes if the villian just up and died. That's what happens in this story. The villian simply dies of exhaustion and everything becomes alright. It is probable that Conan was working under size restrictions but a writer of such great works as Sherlock Holmes should have tried harder."
2,Expensive book with limited value,"The book is published in a binder form and costs $95,- For this money the readers would be entitled to a detailed and practical guide, usable in their work and a source to refer to. Unfortunately the book is quite superficial, too verbose and not even clearly presented. Its major defect is that in fact it says very little about contract administration itself, that is the work the contract administrator does after the contract is signed and until it is completed. There is very little on how to deal with the other contractual party, what problems occur and how to handle them. There are some parts which are clearly irritating, for instance : Part 10. Title: What is a claim? The author says : ""Some think this, other think that. In fact there are many types of claims"", and does not answer the question he himself asks in the title.Definitely not value for money."
4,Great Book!,"I had read this book in 1994 but lost my original copy so I ordered it again on amazon. This was a good book, not great but if your into vampire books and want a female vampire main character you will luv this book. I enjoyed it and think any vampire enthusiast will as well."
4,Not Your Typical Love Story,"First let me say that is book isnt your typical love story where the main characters fall in love at first sight. There isnt very much interaction between the hero and heroine.At the age of twenty-nine Viscount Ashley Desford is lectured by his father, the Earl of Wroxton that he should now consider settling down and producing an heir.Viscount Desford attends a country ball and accidently meets Charity Steane, a nineteen year old girl living almost as a maid in her aunt's home.He brings it upon himself to help this unfortunate creature from a sad life of servintude and tries to track down her grandfather since her father is considered dead. He has Miss Steane stay with his dearest childhood friend Miss Henrietta Silverdale and her mother Lady Silverdale's countyhome. In the process of running throughout the country, Ashley realizes his own heart. Clean romance, characters are well developed and it is a story I would read again."
3,Not impressed with this one,"Everything is just average (if not boring) in this one. I found no sparks flying between the hero and heroin. I kept waiting and waiting for the story to take an interesting turn, and it never did. Halfway through, I was almost tempted to put this one down, but for sheer obstinacy. I was quite disappointed when I reached the last line, but also relieved because I can finally go on to the next one in my Heyer list."
4,Very enjoyable and humorous Regency romance,"""Charity Girl"" is a historical romance novel set in England during the British Regency period (1811-1820). As usual for Heyer, the story was very funny. There was a nice level of historical detail woven into the story, and the characters were all enjoyable. It was clear which woman was best suited to Desford, and it was fun seeing how they would finally end up together. The only reason this book didn't quite rate among my very favorite Heyer's novels is that a few scenes ran on a little too long, in my opinion.There was no sex. There was some explicit bad language. Overall, I'd highly recommend this humorous romance."
3,Overuse of cant terms and phrases,"This is a later work, and is missing the character development and true dialogue between characters that create such enjoyable characters in her earlier works. The dialogue that is here seems to consist of every cant phrase and idiom that has ever appeared in any of G. Heyer's books. This may have been an attempt to appeal to a new generation of readers or simply evidence of a waning interest by the author. As with most of G. Heyer's books I will reread it several times and may find that I have missed some quiet humor. It should be read by any fan, but will never be my favorite. Venetia has that honor."
1,Kindle Edition Could Use Some Editing,There are problems with spaces and hyphens that occur throughout this book. Amazon has been good enough to fix other books with typos; please add this one to the list!
4,Into the Dragon's Teeth,"Interesting abbreviated history of WWII as told from the point of view of three GI's from the Albany, NY area. These men, at the age of approximately 20, were called upon to defend against the Nazi horde, specifically at the Battle of the Bulge. The author has used the interviews with these men to skillfully weave an element of realism into this historical account, thus making it come alive. I came away with admiration and respect for the courage and humanity of these men."
1,Very disappointed,"I purchased this product mainly on reviews written by users of the product. I found that it did not improve my symptoms and in fact, they became worse."
2,Acacia Powder,I have IBS-D for over 20 years. I have tried fibers. This too did not work. I gave it about a month.
2,no help,"I tried the fiber for a couple of weeks, got up to one and a half teaspoonsand noticed a marked increase in bloating.I just don't think more fiber is really what I need!Not sure where to go from here."
2,Thumbs down,I wish I hadn't wasted my money on this product and purchased Miralax instead. It might work for you but it did not work for me.
3,Tends to get clumpy w/over a tablesoon.,Dissovles nicely w/a tsp or less but tends to clump with a Tbs. We haven't used it long enough to note improvement in our daughters stomach pain but will continue to try it...
5,love it,I get great results using a big spoonful of this and a big spoonful of organic psyllium powder in an 8 oz. smoothie every morning. Definately helps keep the colon clean.
1,Heathers did not help me,I suffer from IC and have a sensitive bowel and was told by a representative at ICN that this product is IC friendly. I tried Heather'sTummy Fiber for 1 month and did not notice any improvement.
1,Did not work for me,"I have IBS-C and this made the constipation worse. Unfortunately, I now have this huge amount of fiber that I can't use. Heather should provide a trial size."
3,Not what I expected...,"The fiber doesn't dissolve in water the way I hoped it would. Yes, I followed the instructions precisely but the fiber itself clumps and expands rather quickly. The texture doesn't suit me when puffy balls of tasteless mush are needing to go down. Instead of using it in a beverage I will have to use the rest of the can in dry applications...and not purchase again. I really wanted this product to work out for me but no..."
2,made my tummy hurt,"I'm sure its great for some people, but it made my stomach hurt. I gave it a week and introduced it slowly, but to no avail. An expensive experiment."
4,a good option,"My husband had been using a Metamucil powder. I wanted to begin a fiber supplement, and I wanted something organic. This product works best when I mix it into my oatmeal, or applesauce, or something with that kind of consistency. It does have a slight taste when I use 6 teaspoons in one bowl of oatmeal, and it is not unpleasant. This powder does not mix in without some clumping. My husband mixes one teaspoon into a small glass of water twice a day, and that works for him. I'm not sure it helps as much as I want it to with irregularity. I have been using it everyday for a month, and still do not BM everyday. Still a work in progress...."
1,Didn't work for me,"I suffer from IBS with constipation and this made me very painfully gassy, bloated, and did not alleviate the constipation. I loved that it would (eventually) dissolve completely in liquid, but after a month of feeling miserable from it, had to give it up."
1,Didn't help - possibly made worse,Heather's Tummy Fiber CAN ~ Organic Acacia 16 oz. CANISTERI have tried this product several times. I doesn't seem to help regulate me and in fact several times after taking it I've had several cramps and gas pains the following day. The peppermint tabs don't seem to help much either. I do better with Metamucil.
1,expensive & ineffective,This stuff wouldn't dissolve - very lumpy. Did not help my IBS at all; may have even worsened it. Never buying any of Heather's products again. Very disappointing.
3,Western mayhem,"Don't read this book....unless you're prepared to read the ton of otherbooks in the ""Smoke Jensen and Preacher"" series. This author writes a bookbefore breakfast and another just before dinner. They're plentiful andhighly addictive. Suspend belief and enjoy.Smoke Jensen, in particular, shoots or fist fights around a hundredhard cases per book and they all highly deserve the mayhem he delivers.In spite of this high fiction (most famous old West gunfighters onlykilled 3 or 4 men in their entire lives) you'll soldier on with theseries because Smoke Jensen is the stuff heros are made of and thewriting is crisp and moving.Just don't say you weren't warned when you find that you spent your wholesummer (or winter) in a comfy chair with 50 or so of these read booksstrewn around you."
4,SMOKE IS AT IT AGIAN,BIG MAX HIGGINS DIDNT THINK WHEN HE HAD SMOKES WIFE KIDNAPPED!!! SMOKE HAS TO USE EVERYTHING HE HAS LEARNED TO GET HER BACK. VERY EXCITING BOOK.
1,YOU GOTTA BE KIDDING ME!!!,"My B-I-L loved this book, , ,loved it!!! So, he sent it to me.I thought it was the most hilarious, unbelievable book I haveever read!!! """"Marshal, is it true that you have killed more than100 men""""?? """"Well, to tell the truth, it is more like 400, but, whois counting, , ,but, , ,I like puppies"""""". This is not a direct quote, , ,but, , ,you get the idea. He shoots about another 60, knifes 3 or 4, beats 3 or 4 withhis fists, and, blows up a lot more with dynamite. What bunch of bullarky!!!"
2,it`s a secret,"this is a 50 to 60 minute dvd, it has almost nothing new for a area 51 or ufo buff, in mostly has pics of the entry sighs to the area 51, and all interviewers say basicly the same thing that the area contains secrets, for these reasons itself i would`nt have bought it."
4,Beyond Top Secret,"True, this DVD has information that is already known to most Area 51 buffs. For those that are new to the subject, this DVD is very informative. I own 4 other documentaries on Area 51 and they all include facts that other DVDs may not have. This one probably being the latest of the Area 51 releases mentions why the installation was built, the different nicknames the base has, how federal law doesn't apply there, what may happen to anyone who challenges the security measures, etc. The fact that our government denies the base's existance is totally absurd! They say that ""the base doesn't exist and neither do it's employees"". Later on, lawyer Jonathan Turley reveals that 2 workers at the base got sick and died from radiation poisoning. This is a guy that fought tooth-and-nail to get the government to admit that there is a researching facility at Groom Lake (another name for the base). Very interesting information. Check it out."
3,Good Documentary but nothing new,"I bought this DVD last year. This documentary is good, interesting and very well done. However most people interested in Area 51 won't learn anything new. This is the ""basic stuff"", and 50 minutes is short for this kind of documentary. They should have done a 2 hour episode. But it's a good addition to a collection."
4,Great product; Horrendous support!,Advantages:1) Easy to configure2) Fast and reliable3) Print Server4) Runs linux; Allows hacks and new features5) Yahoo user group where people share information.6) Tried netdisk by Ximeta; shouldn't have wasted my time and just bought this.Disadvantages:1) Shipping firmware 1.43 didn't work for me.2) Support took a week and a half to let me know (that is the advantage of the Yahoo user group got the info in 10 minutes)3) A little more expensive than similar NAS options.4) Included connection software looks like it was written for Windows 3.1Bottom line is once it is working it is pretty impressive and flawless. There is alot that can be done with it and alot of support beyond Buffalo making more information available!
1,Just plain terrible,"I bought this hoping it would solve my problems needing a print server and file server.The print server has no setting besides changing the name of the printer. No documentation on it as well. I bought a linksys print server and was able to customize it so everyone in the office was able to connect with NO problems using windows, mac osx, mac os 9 and linux.As far as the file server, the permissions are limited to folder level. I bought it to ease my pain trying to work with windows 2003 woes and permissions. When I called tech support asking how to set one user with read/write permission and everyone else with read only....they said it wasn't possible. I tried for hours thinking there was a way around it. Nope.Use the linksys nslu2 system if you want something that is SO easy and effective. The speed may be higher on this unit due to ide vs usb2 but the interface is years behind a well polished company like linksys."
3,"Fair, not great","The Linkstation works pretty well at home, but the setup is a problem. Novice users will find it confusing; experts will find it confining, almost doing what is needed. Managing the disk is tedious, the extra printer support didn't work for my printer (HP 1210).As a disk server that is already running, it works reasonably well. It has a problem with power failures -- unlike everything else that knows how to turn on again, you need to walk over and manually use the switch on the front.I would recommend you consider instead the SimpleTech SIMPLESHARE that was a lot easier to run, though slightly slower than this device."
2,go get a Lonely Planet guide for this sort of thing,"*this review refers to the 1999 edition*I know the entire region pretty well and have read the Thailand and Cambodia sections of the book. I say the best way to travel is without a guidebook (most of these places can be negotiated with maps alone), but if you're going to get one...The information that's in this book is pretty good, but there's not much of it. The layout looks good, but it isn't done with the visual economy of Lonely Planet guides, which have more information and are easier to read. (The LP guide is also easier to carry around, which is important for a SE Asia guide.)The Cambodia section in this guide is remarkably sparse.In short: get Lonely Planet's version, or don't get one at all. You might also try Fielding's, if they ever get around to updating it."
3,great condition but a slow read,"My sister and I tried to find this book everywhere and finally found it here. I was impressed with how fast it got here and the great condition it was in when I received it. I was extremely impressed with the book itsself. It was a very slow read and had a lot of background and not much up front information. I would recommend purchasing from this supplier but if your looking for a good, informed read, I wouldn't purchase this one."
2,Very disapointing,"You may get 95 pieces but many of them are the same. For example, there are 6 screwdriver bits that you get qty 5 of each - that counts as 30 pieces right there but there are only 6 unique pieces. You can get these bits dirt cheap at any home improvement store by the bucket. They should disclose the exact contents on the ad. Also, there are no masonry bits. It comes with the rapid changer but most of the drill bits are standard ones that won't fit in the changer. Don't buy this!"
1,So so kit with so so quality and so so usefulness,"Although this is touted 95 pieces and may sound a lot, what you get is not really all that useful. There are tons of screwdriver bits, what for? How many of us really switch out screwdriver bits every time we use a different screw? I can understand having 3 each for slotted and philips, but not in the 10s.Also, the quality seems cheap. Having this for 2 weeks, I already have some rusts on the converter bit, even though this never touched any water. Also, this kit comes with a set of square drive bits but not hex or torx drive bits. HOW OFTEN DO YOU USE SQUARE BOLTS??? The socket selction is minimal, and the drill bits seem cheezy too. This is a $20 set at best, you pay $20 extra for DeWALT logo and a decent case."
5,A great assortment of bits,"I bought this when it was on the Friday Sale at Amazon. A great bargain! I used to have dozens of loose bits in the box that held my electric drill. Some were dull, some broken and none in any sense of order. This assortment not only includes almost anything you'd need for a drill, but keeps them in order. I've used DeWalt tools and bits for a long time and the quality is excellent."
4,good buy,This set is very handy I like the case to keep up with all your bits...wide variety in the kit. I've had mine for about 6 months and have been very pleased with all of it. The only thing missing is the spade bits. There are a lot of the same bits but I liked that because it has and will be nice to have spares....if you use yours like I do you'll need them.
3,Too small,"While I like the contents of this book and its many photos, it should have been the size of a coffee table book. Its cropped nature makes for a less enjoyable read than would a larger lap book. The smallness of it makes the book seem big, because it is extremely thick for any book; about 450 pages. Why not a larger, more readable book of 100 pages? It is a disappointing physical format."
2,Video quality could have been better,"This DVD has a low price but the video quality was disappointing. Mosquito noise, and block noise in fast motion scenes are noticeable.A thing that surprised me was that the four movies were stored on one SINGLE-layer (not dual-layer) double-sided DVD. In addition to the above shortcoming, not all of the 4.7 GB space available on each side of the DVD was utilized, unnecessarily lowering video quality.Side 1:Pokemon - 4Ever (in 16:9 AR)Pokemon - Heroes The Movie (in 4:3 AR)3.11 GBSide 2:Pokemon - Jirachi Wish Maker (in 4:3 AR)Pokemon - Destiny Deoxys (in 16:9 AR)3.66 GBAnd there are no subtitles nor closed captions nor extras at all. And the menus are very simple and plain.Price aside, this DVD is a disappointment. There are no subtitles. If you are going to watch it on a big screen TV, be prepared for not-so-good video quality."
4,"Fine addition, not the greatest quality but workable","So even after all the reviews, the warnings of buzzing noises and poor quality, I decided to buy it myself. Honestly, it came to my house very fast, and I was happy with it. The only one that really had a buzzing noise for me was the Pokémon 4Ever movie. All of the others were in decent quality. Yes, it does not have anything ""extra"" just the four movies. But for any collection, I feel that it is perfectly fine. If you just want to enjoy the Pokémon movies, then this is worth your money. If you would rather have perfection, then I would try them separately."
4,A Wonderful Period Piece,"A very appealing cast makes this movie, set in the early 1900s, an enjoyable time. Charlton Heston plays a gruff old farmer in Nova Scotia who has lost his son in the Boer War in South Africa. His son's boys come to live with him, their grandmother, and their daughter.The two boys are wonderfully played by two youngsters, Leo Wheatley and Charles Miller, the daughter is the beautiful Leah Pinsent, and the doctor by Bruce Greenwood. (Greenwood, who looks like a young Sam Neill, has gone on to have a fine movie career, and can be seen in 'The World's Fastest Indian'.)Grandfather James MacKenzie bears a hatred of the Boers (Dutch). The doctor, who falls in love with Kirsten, is a Boer.The young boys find a surprise on the family beach.With the exception of the surprise, the plot is a bit predictable, but the set design, the accents, and the acting is top notch.Recommended."
4,Musically Tight Like Fishbone& BadBrains,"and in a way 'Outlandos d' Amour"" the first Police album(& styalistic similaritis abound).Their song writing is good to sometimes great although lyrically they sound a little young, that's not a crime. I first heard the song Back To The Rebels on the Black Rock Coalation compilation CD 'Rock 'N' Roll Reparations' and liked it enough to look them up on amazon and but the CD. THE RYTHYM SECTION SMOKES! If you like the bands that I've mentioned or anyone supported by the BRC check this out.I don't agree with the 'classic rock' comparisons of another reviewer, i hear funkrock w/ a good bit of punk and reggae done well."
4,Still good just different,"The Exit's new effort Home for an Island is a solid, creative, and basically all around good album. The new sound is a change from their previous punk rock feel, but with ""the exit"" of the punk rock sound also went the energy and true rock feel New Beat had. Home for an Island is a much more relaxed album and somewhat reminds me of former Chicago band, The Freddy Jones Band. The album is good, and definitely worth the purchase, but fans looking for the same rock energy as New Beat will be disappointed. Still good just different."
3,nice exhaust but wear out quick.,sounded and looked great when i first put it on but now it's getting rusty and raspy after about 5 months. I'm now planning on ordering a custom magnaflow system.
1,one of the worst movies made,"This movie sucks. Talentless gibberish and stereotypical garbage. I really don't see how anyone rational could say this movie is of any value. Its boring, its stupid, it wasn't funny at all. I'll probably get a drinking problem now trying to forget that I ever had to watch this trash.Don't buy it, don't rent it, don't even think about this movie. Its bad! I would give it a -5 if I could. This should be put in the same place as Arsenio Hall, FORGOTTEN!"
2,eh..,"did not like the movie. dvd came brand new and in great condition, but i still did not like the movie."
1,DEATH OF A MOVIE!!!,This is by far the worst movie I've ever seen. Don't waste your time buying it. They have reject actors playing the parts of Dame Dash and Jay-Z (who do terrible jobs)!! Movie had no point to it.. Simply terrible.
2,Don't bother with this one!,"Not up to Stannard's usual standards of excellence in sounds. The tubes are solid - not hollow. They produce a tinkling, tinny, unpleasant sound (my opinion). As they are small, they chime most of the time, on the slightest air currant. Rather unnerving. This chime is, however, very pretty. Small size, shiny bronze tubes, pretty green woods and very nice feather engraving. That is why I gave it 2 stars. For appearance, rather than for any melodious sound."
1,Dumb title,"Why don't they name it level 1, 2, 3, 4 instead of red and orange, etc? This is not the homeland security handbook for the illiterate agent who can only identify color."
3,Disappointing,"I had high hopes for this version of the Liturgy of the Hours. Unfortunately, these hopes were not realized. Like other reviewers, I think the translation of the Invitatory (Psalm 95) is terrible. It's poor English and an awkward version of the Psalm. The print is too small for anyone over the age of 35. Also their is little explanation of how to say the Office and the set up is rather strange. All in all, their are far better versions for Catholics and I would recommend that Protestants use/adapt the Offices from the book of Common Prayer."
3,"If you're looking for traditional, look elsewhere","The book isn't bad; it is well made, the many ribbons are really helpful, and most of the text is ok. However, the prayers aren't what you would expect to read. Even basics like the Magnificat are 'touched up' and lose much of their poetic familiarity with updated and neutered language.Not being a regular on the liturgy of the hours, I also found the layout a bit hard to follow."
4,Liturgy of the Hours,"I did not find the instructions on how to use the Brievary very ""user friendly"", but after some instruction from my pastor, I found the Brievary fairly easy to use. I pray the Brievary for Lauds, Vespers and Compline and look forward to that time spent with the Lord and the Psalms, which He, and centuries of Jews and Christians have prayed. I would urge others to make/take the time to pray the daily Liturgy of the Hours. I even gave up my treasured Magnificat magazine to spend time with the Benedictine Daily Prayer!"
2,disappointment,"If you are looking for a breviary with the full complement of psalms forget this one. There are only about 100 of the total 150 prescribed by the Rule of St. Benedict and some of them are shortened. When the publisher calls this a short breviary he doesn't come right out and say that it is brief in the psalm complement, and in fact you will not find a psalm list in the index. The introduction of the breviary cleverly skirts the issue with a little deft word play. Why not just come out and say it. It's a waste of money. I'll stick with the LOTH and fiddle to read the whole psalmody with my bible. Why doesn't someone make a decent breviary with a two week psalmody?"
5,"The Truth, not a fairytale!",I am 12 years old and this book touched me and so did the movie!!!! In fairytales the end is happy and everyone lives happily ever after. Whatever! That hardly ever happens. This story tells the truth that not all relationships are perfect. I found myself crying at the end because I want to love someone like Tristan and Isolde loved each other!!!! I recomend buying this and the 2006 movie Tristan and Isolde. Their both GREAT!!!!
4,LARGE PRINT EDITION,"The story was just what you'd expect a Sharpe series story to be: entertaining, and making you learn about the history of the Napoleonic wars while making you feel as if you were in the front lines.Note that this is the large print edition (I didn't notice or expect this when ordering it), which is mildly irritating to read if you are used to read books in regular font."
2,Not his best,"In fact, it may be his worst. As much as I love the 21 novels of the Sharpe series, this one shows signs of carelessness and indifference on the part of its author. The plot is loosely thrown together and the whore-pretending-to-be-respectable-and-snaring-a-British-officer theme is straight out of ""Sharpe's Enemy"". Cornwell is churning books out at a terrific clip with the ""Lords of the North series"", Sharpe, the Grail Quest and various singletons. Maybe it's time he took a rest or concentrated on one project."
3,"Not too bad, but we have heard the story before!","If you are a first time fan of the Sharpe series, I believe that you will enjoy this new addition to the much loved series. But as a long time fan, I felt somewhat disappointed in this book largely for 3 reasons:1. We have read this story before with the revenge motiffs and this story did not add a whole lot to this legendary motivation of Richard Sharpe.2. No particularly compelling bad-guy--this book needed Pierre Ducos or Sgt. Hakeswill very badly!3. No compelling love interest for Sharpe--a little fling for Sharpe in the first half--but no woman encountered who was all that interesting!Having said all that, the last quarter of the book which describes the battle of Barrosa is extremely fine and exciting which elevates this Sharpe novel a bit. There are however, much finer Sharpe novels out there and I heartily recomend them-but Sharpe's Fury rates a C+ or a B- at best with me!"
3,Sharpe's Newest,"I have read everyone of the Sharpe series and love them. This recent is a good book, but for me the least exciting. It appears that our favorite author may be getting tired of this series. Too much historical overview and battle activity without mention of Sharpe. I hope thiis is not the last, but maybe there are no good battles left for Sharpe to fight."
3,If you like Uli,"The music was great! If you are in it for Uli's amazing fretwork, you won't be disappointed. The only problem is that Uli also does all the vocals. If you have heard Uli sing then you know what I am talking about. His vocals are one of two things keeping my rating from being 5 stars. The other is the 3rd CD. Uli's attempt at Opera/Symphony. I haven't given the whole thing a chance, but it was pretty weird for an Uli fan who wants to hear him SHRED!!! If you are a die-hard Uli fan you should have this set; however, it would not be my choice if I was trying to make a true believer out of someone new to his genius."
4,Say We Can!,"In the late 1980's Diana returns back to Motown.Tracklisting:1) Workin' Overtime2) Say We Can3) Take The Bitter With The Sweet4) Bottom Line5) This House6) Paradise7) Keep On (Dancin')8) What Can One Person Do9) Goin' Through The Motions10) We Stand TogetherDiana commented at the time 'Workin' Overtime': ""It's a new day for both Motown and myself. For me, it's an opportunity to put back into the music industry some of the knowledge that i've gained. I especially want to use my experience to guide younger talents as they start their careers. My return also reflects my belief in Motown as a label capable of tapping the energy and style of today's youth"".The Results, Sadly the album was a commercial disaster. With all its hype, it disappointed a lot of fans and although it climbed to No.23 on the U.K album charts it just went by unnoticed."
3,She Didn't Work 2 Much Overtime On This...,"I luv Ms. Ross, but I honestly only like a few songs off of this album. Poor wanna-be hip hop tracks, but should be in any Ross fan's collection."
3,"Not up to par with Ross's first collaboration with ""Chic"" but listenable","""Workin' Overtime"" is one of those albums that is truly in the middle ground: not good enough to be considered ""great"" and not bad enough to be a ""bomb.""On several tracks, the singer sounds strained as if she has to ""scream"" in order to overcome the trademark bass lines of the Chic sound, so common in Rodgers/Edwards productions.The album is in no way as dynamic as 1980's ""Diana,"" the album that yielded mega-hits ""I'm Coming Out"" and ""Upside Down.""It's a keeper for those diehard fans, like myself, that, at one time, couldn't resist buying anything with Miss Ross's name on it."
1,Diana's worst,"Diana had hit rock bottom musically in the late 80s. Her 1987 album Red Hot Rhythym and Blues was a flop, and this album, an attempt to stay trendy and youthful, did even worse.In my opinion, it's Diana's worst album. Diana tries her best but producer Nile Rodgers surrounds her voice with hip-hop/R&B; beats that sounded dated even in 1989. By this time, Rodgers had peaked as a producer. The magic that he brought to Chic projects and to albums by singers such as David Bowie and Madonna was no longer there.The title track is not bad, and the single ""Paradise"" is actually much better in its remix version. But there's not much else to recommend.Thankfully, Diana's albums in the 90s showed a re-energized Diana, particularly ""Take Me Higher"" and ""Every Day is a New Day"". Those are excellent albums and I recommend those over this dreary collection."
3,Tryin' to be Paula Abdul?!,"Well, after the break up with RCA, she returned to MOTOWN now without Gordy!. Workin' Overtime was an album that tried to update Diana to the New Jack Swing and the new rhythms of the late 80's kind of Ross Paula Abdul. Produced by Nile Rodgers, this long time awaited reunion of Diana with the creator of her best album yet, failed short to be a reminiscence of that glorious album. Full of filler cuts without any true outstanding singles this album is not that bad, it just a feel good album that sadly fades fast out of your memory. Diana will stand out more fairly in Take Me Higher or Everyday is a New Day."

5,Love it!,This soap has the most amazing smell. I use it every day and I have purchased the hand cream too.
4,Cute book. Good for inclusion classes.,"This is a fictional story about a girl named Angel and her friendship with Sam, a classmate who has Autistic Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Angel explains how Sam thinks and behaves in school and at home. She describes characteristics, such as sensory differences, repetition, and communication difficulties. Written in very positive language, this book also includes tips for teachers."
4,Recommended for inclusive classrooms and school libraries,"This is a fictional story about a girl named Angel and her friendship with Sam, a classmate who has autism spectrum disorder (ASD). From her own point of view, Angel explains how Sam thinks and behaves in school and at home. She describes characteristics such as sensory differences, repetition, and communication difficulties. Written in very positive language, this book also includes tips for teachers. For children ages 5-10. Please visit our website to obtain a copy of this educational resource for children."
3,Disability awareness,"This book is one in a series on various disabilities and medical issues. Each book has Teacher Tips and resources at the end as well as a quiz. I always find these useful. I don't really care for the portrayal of the individual with autism. If you had a student in the class who was exactly like him, it might work. I have a problem with the generalizations that are made, not all kids with autism take meds, not all kdis with autism have echolalia. I think it could give kids the wrong impression. There are better books on autism out there."
4,Easy for young kids to understand,a good book for classic autism. my son has pdd nos and it is to stereotyped for him to relate to the character.
5,Excellent pre-Columbian archaeology review.,"It is a fact that North and South America are crawling with evidence that there were visitors from Europe and Asia centuries before Columbus. Skeletons, artifacts and inscriptions abound. Denied by mainstream archaeology, but refuted by analysis of DNA, bone structure and common sense. (See the April 26, 1999 issue of Newsweek -- it is the cover story.) If you like this book, you will like Gloria Farley's ""In Plain Sight."""
4,Another fabulous set by dj Mark Farina,"I stumbled upon this gem while browsing Amazon.com. Despite the fact that there were no reviews and no track listing, I ordered it anyway. Once again, Mark Farina puts together a fabulous mix of house music. This CD shows Mark's talent for track selection; he has put together a wonderful mix of deep/disco house music. Although he doesn't show off his raw talent for mixing (Try Mushroom Jazz #2), the music is pure joy to listen to. It ranks right up there with his Seasons One CD."
2,Not Worth the money,"Those may be great glasses for someone who is looking just to buy a regular sunglasses, the build is sturdy, but dont expect anything fancy, on the picture the glasses look very good, however when I received them the design does not look good on face as it does not cover the eyebrows, making it look somewhat silly, I would not recommend it!!!If you are looking for inexpensive sunglasses better go to retail sales outlet and buy designers glasses, this way you know you will not look like a f00l in them, this was a waste of money for me."
4,"Feel a little flimsy, but work well","These feel slightly flimsy, but haven't broken in the past several months that I've had them so far. I use them for driving. Good sunglasses for the cheap price."
3,Sunglasses,Sunglasses are hard to write a review on because there are so many different preferences for sunglasses. These sunglasses provide a tight fit and dark tinted lenses for very sunny days. They did not quite fit my preference but i'm sure someone else would enjoy them.
1,Not please at all,These sunglasses were very loose on me and the problem I have is that I don't have time to go to the post office. I am very dissapointed and will never buy from this vendor again.
4,Great Game,"I bought this for my 6 year old nephew for Christmas. He really likes the game Trouble, and now loves this game, too! It took him a few turns to figure it out, but he got a hang of it and beat me.The board is a little wobbly, it doesn't rest directly on the surface of the table, they have you put on these three disks which make the board seem a bit flimsy, especially since you have to pop the number bubble...But, it's definitely a fun, good family game!"
4,Fun for the whole family,Fun for the whole family. It is like trouble but never ending until someone wins. We love trouble so thought this would be just as fun.
1,Limited in APIs included - Not worth the money,"I was very disappointed in the small scope of the book. Very few APIs were included. Of course, the ones I needed were not in the book. For me, a total waste of money. Might be OK for someone wanting help with very simple APIs."
3,"CGurus,VBBlackBelt,COM,MIcrosoft,un world of Confusion","It is difficult for a VB programmer to translate in vb the expression of C family. Example : confusion about pointers between pointer variable and pointer ,between Vtable Interface and object structure.e.i. between contents and container. and light for object Nevertheless,is very good for stack,hexa etc and I advise further information the reading of article at RomanPress.com and utana.com"
1,Unclear on the concept,"There's something fundamentally wrong with the concept of a puzzle book for an application programming interface. A book about an API should yield clarity, not puzzles."
2,Same old stuff,"The description of this video implies that the contents are erotic extras from Greenwood/Cooper movies. In reality, the tape appears to be nothing more than more of the same. If you like Greenwood/Cooper movies, than this tape might be of interest to you. If you are looking for something more, don't bother with this tape. You won't find it here."
2,Soft-core erotic cuts,"The promo for this video says it is filled with material considered too graphic to put into this production company's regular vids. The video, though, is both disappointing and unexceptional."
4,I would love this more if.....,I have been hunting around for such a mirror in Singapore for months and the nearest I could find is a lighted wall hung mirror with 3x magnification. I would love this product even more if this come in local voltage. I have to buy a step-up transformer and do not feel exactly comfortable using it since it gives a buzzing sound. I hope that Conair would manufacture in dual voltage(110 & 220v)or at least allow the consumer to choose the voltage they want....talking about going global!
2,ring view,I don't like the way the light shows in the reflection when I look in the mirror. I would prefer a mirror without the light . The cord is an added mess to the countertop. Too late now.
3,"the magnification, great--the light, not so much","This mirror functions very well if it is located in a good natural source of light. The light on the mirror itself is just so so. I have it near a window, so am satisfied, but I wouldn't be if I had to depend to the mirror's light. I really like the oval shape and the magnification."
2,Weak light,"I used to have a Revlon mirror, which worked great. I bought this Conair mirror because it was more stylish (polished chrome compared to my plastic Revlon mirror). Unfortunately even the brightest setting on this mirror is not as bright as I desire. Secondly, every time I bump the base, it turns the light off! I wish that I would have stuck with my Revlon."
1,"Mirror too small, light totally inadequate","I had been looking forward to this product until I plugged it in and turned it on. As I leaned forward to look in the mirror, I was so close I was almost touching it to see myself and that was distorted. When I leaned back a little, forget it, I could not discern my face at all. The light was very dim on the highest setting compared to my old makeup mirror. I irritably packed the mirror up and shipped it back for a refund.I don't understand why someone can't make a pretty makeup mirror that doesn't distort your face severely. It would also be nice to have a light setting that is more powerful and useful.My desk mirror I intended on replacing (a Clairol), is 25 years old and have not had to replace the lights, yet. (knock on wood) I suppose as ugly and space consuming as it is, I should stick with what still works and forget esthetics."
5,Very nice!,"What a deal! I did not expect this mirror to be this nice for such a low price. The lighting is perfect. The magnification is great for tweezing. It looks great on the bathroom counter, no need to hide it away, it's so pretty you will want to leave it out. Also, you simply turn it on by tapping the bottom base, very convenient. I think I will buy one for my mother too!"
5,Great product!,Perfect for tweezing your brows perfectly or finding those little imperfections you didn't even know you had! The magnification with this mirror is awesome.
4,Very useful mirror (just wish the light would stop going on by itself!),"This is a solid make-up mirror for the price - nice size, shape, 3-level lighting, and magnification. The ultra-magnification spot on the one side is perfect for a close-up view of an eye (or whatever).... From an aesthetic standpoint, I'm not a fan of the pock-marks on the base - they really don't add anything; but that's minor. My one real gripe with this mirror is that the light frequently (maybe twice a week or so?)goes on by itself! I initially blamed my husband and my kids - and then it happened when they weren't around - and I hadn't gone near the mirror. Not a big deal, but of course the bulb life won't be as long (and it's annoying to see that light coming from the bathroom in the middle of the night - somehow it always happens at night - or maybe that's just when I actually notice it - and to have to drag myself out of bed to turn it off."
3,Expected more light,"If you want a very high magnification, this is the mirror for you. It would work for anyone who isn't ""completely"" blind. The only thing I don't like about it, is the lighting from it is dimmer than my older mirror which unfortunately only has 5x magnification. So although the magnification on the new one is higher, (almost too high) it is not bright enough for me either. I am still using my older one for the better lighting and have this new one right next to it for better magnifying purposes. If you have a 5x now, I would only suggest a step up to a better lit 7x mirror."
3,"Great mirror, poor light",The mirror portion of this product is excellent. The mirror is sturdy and looks nice. What's lacking is the light quality. It is very poor. I had to add lamps on my vanity for there to be sufficient lighting to do makeup.
3,It's OK,"The lighting is poor, and with the touch on base, I accidently turn it off all of the time. The magnification is good, and if you hold it up to natural light, it does the job. Definately not the old Lady Clarol mirror with the bright lights."
3,"Good mirror, not enough lighting","This mirror is great to use for makeup although the lighting isnt bright enough. The magnification is great for plucking eyebrows! After using this mirror with the magnification, I noticed that my eyebrows were definitely nicer because I could see all the strays! The light will enhance makeup application if you have lighting that is already so-so. If you don't, you'll need an additional light source. Other than that, this is a great product."
5,Great Item,I bought this as a gift for my mom. She says it's great and really likes the built in extra magnification spot.
3,tired of the fuzz,"These towels are beautiful and soft -- no fading even after several washings. Unfortunately, my husband is tired of picking fibers out of his beard. A guest bath is probably a good place for them. I am back to shopping for a set of towels for the master bath...and the redwood color just wasn't that easy to find! Christy Embrace With Silk Bath Towel- Set of 3- Redwood"
2,"Sumptuous, Large, Fluffy, Elegant Towels","These towels are gorgeous, extremely large, and very plush. We've had them now for almost a year, have washed them every week, and they still look like new...feel thick and soft, with no pilling, no threads hanging--they are just luxurious and fluffy and delightfully BIG. We just love them, as do our guests who visit, who always comment on them...""we love your fancy towels"" ...they are just lovely!"
4,POOR QUALITY CONTROL,"These are lovely, luxurious towels IF they do not arrive with manufacturing defects. I have been dealing with orders and replacements and many have pulls and loose threads. Not a good sign when I've yet to launder them!"
5,"Luxurious, sturdy & SOFT.","I couldn't disagree more with the previous negative review. I have the Christy bath sheets, towels and wash cloths, in the ""natural stone"" color and I LOVE them. I feel like I could never use ""regular"" towels again, they've spoiled me for luxury. They haven't faded, at all, the lint was minimal after the first washing, and they look perfect wash after wash, without the threads becoming uneven or pricking, like so many towels tend to do. I couldn't love these more, and I give them as gifts."
3,"Good Service, Not great Product","I decided to try buying supplies for my piggies online due to the fact I am now living where their needed items are hard to find. Everything arrived on time, although one of the bags of litter did have a hole in it. And those of you who have dealt with litter before know it can get rather messy. Due to shipping prices I have decided to just pay a little extra to shop at small business pet stores in my area, which is the only source for guinea pig litter. I have also decided to switch to paper bedding as I know it is far better for a guinea pigs lungs."
2,too pricy,"The item was priced 82 , where the same four packs cost about 40 at giant, 10 dollars a piece, I was totally cheated."
1,Stop this...,"Only 14 tracks, so much for the title, 25#1 from 25 Years. These are the same tracks that get re-cycles and re-cycled again and again.Stop this madness. The mastering is from 1983, that is bad news as they didn't know what the diff was from mastering tape to vinyl compared to the then new CD format."
2,Costly Shipping,The product's shipping cost was way too expensive. Almost 50% the total cost of the product.
4,Totally fits my simplehuman trash can!,"As advertised, the simplehuman brand trash bags (size K) fit my simplehuman trash can (size K).The handles occasionally rip through the bag if our trash has been especially heavy or if we've been especially delinquent in taking out the garbage.Other than that, yes indeedy! These simplehuman size k liners will fit your simplehuman size k trash can!"
1,"Crummy Sound, Crummy Controls = Crummy Radio","Got this for Christmas. Looks great. The sound has average clock radio sound overall. However, at low volumes and especially at no volume a noticeable hum emanates from the speakers. If the thing is on your nightstand, you can't help but be terribly annoyed by this deafening hum. As for the controls, they are arranged well enough, but the volume and tuning controls implement two separate push-buttons each. Would have been better to have dials. Also, the LED is too bright, even on the ""dimmest"" setting. Finally, if you plan on using your 5th Gen iPod with the thing, you better still have the adapter that came with it: it won't sit in the clock's cradle without it. (Adapters for other iPod models are included but, inexplicably, an adapter for 5th Gen iPod is not.)I notice that many other reviews report some of these same issues. Do yourself a favor: don't buy this product."
1,A major rip-off!,"Shame on AMAZON to allow this vendor to sell products! The ""new"" radio I purchased was actually ""used"" . Not only that it was defective! The vendor gave me my money back- but did not refund shipping and handling! Seems to me then have a great racket going- send out defective merchandise - charge for shipping and an outrageous handling fee- keep the handling fee and shipping on those that complain and do it all over again to the next sucker!SHAME ON AMAZON for supporting this vendor!"
1,"Read reviews before buying, and if you still want it, don't","As the other reviewers said, this item has an intolerable buzz. I bought one in a store, it worked fine, so I purchased a second one for a gift here. Mine had no buzz. The one from Amazon arrived with a very loud buzz. The online reviews warned me, but the one at home worked OK, so ""go figure"". After two weeks, the one at home failed completely (the clock, presets, radio, etc. ceased to function.) The ""gift"" unit with the buzz couldn't be corrected. Both units have been returned."
1,Very Disappointed,"BUYER BEWARE- The description might state that it is compatible with any dockable iPod model, but that is not true. After receiving the product and going thru the manual I was dismayed to find that it is only compatible with iPod models available November 2006 or before, rendering it useless for my iPod Touch. Also, as other reviewers have pointed out, the FM reception is terrible. If I held the AC cord in my hand, I could receive 2 FM stations, otherwise I had absolutely no FM reception at all. I just received this last night, and will be returning it today."
3,Does the Job,"I agree with the other review that the light is a bit bright. I wasn't able to find a clock radio with an iPOD connection that didn't have a bright display! What's so hard about that? The only other complaint I had was the Nano insert they provided with the clock requires you to move the pin connector over for some reason. Even then, my Nano didn't fit in the slot properly. I had to use the insert that came with my Nano, put the pin connector back in the main position and it worked like a charm. Why the manufacturer chose this convoluted setup is beyond me. Other than that the sound is real nice and the features work as expected. We just have to get used to sleeping with a nightlight!!"
4,Good Buy for the Price,"This alarm clock has worked well, especially for the price, which was significantly lower than other iPod 2-alarm radio clocks. The sound quality is good, and I really like that the battery back-up is lithium so I don't need to replace it every six months. Also, I don't have to worry about radio presets, alarm settings, clock settings, or DST -- everything is stored and updated automatically. A couple things I don't like -- the numbers are pretty bright even on the low setting, and I don't like the iPod support bracket placement -- if I want to shut the sliding door to keep the iPod connector dust-free, I have to take the bracket off every time. Also, I wish there was a way to start the sleep function on the remote. Overall, I do like the product and will probably purchase another one in the future."
1,c***-ola,"I bought one of these at 20% off at a Comp-USA that was closing, and boy, did I get rooked. The thing lasted a total of three weeks--two of which I was out of town and not using it--before giving up the ghost. Now it's as silent as a paperweight, regardless of whether I try to just listen to the radio or play something on my ipod. It DOES make a nifty, ultra-expensive clock on which to rest your ipod when you DON'T want to listen to it, though.Do yourself a favor and buy something from a reputable, competent manufacturer. I've had bad luck with Emerson Research garbage in the past, but evidently didn't learn my lesson well enough."
2,I have owned 2 of these.,"I didn't buy mine from Amazon.I was dissapointed in this unit.The first unsit didn't seem to put out much noise out of the right speaker,so I took it to the store to exchange it.The one I have now is the same way.Hardly any music comes out of the right speaker plus the remote doesn't work."
1,doesnt work,"i bought the emerson thing for an ipod docking station and more importantly clock radio. while it realy has some cool features (auto set time, 2 alarms, weekday/weekend settings) the product doesnt work. the system refuses to be able to control my ipod from the dock or the remote. i need to use the controls on the ipod to turn it on, pause, swiqtch song etc. i even returned my first defective unit and the replacement is just as bad. to make sure it wasnt my mistake i even called emerson after the first unit and they said the product was defective. 0/2 is a pretty bad streak...im trying iHome, stay away"
1,False Advertisement,"I purchased this clock radio to use with my 3rd generation iPod. I received it and it could not play my iPod. I emailed Emerson and they said this radio is incompatible with 3rd gen iPods. It says in the product description compatible with all dockable iPods. My iPod came with a dock so shouldn't it be dockable. The radio even came with the correct dock adapter for my iPod, so if it isn't compatible why would they waste their money and put that in with the radio."
2,Emerson iC200BK iTone dual-alarm iPod clock radio,Bought this and returned to iHome IH-5 (IH-7 unavailable at the time) because the alarm controls are tiny little buttons on the right side of the case (instead of the top). Rarely did I set the alarm correctly; always had to pick up the whole box to set - the controls should be ON TOP!! WHERE THEY CAN BE RELIABLY USED!
1,awful experience!,"Everything started well. Good sound, lots of features. But it only plays one song from the playlist for the wakeup alarm. After only one month of owning it it started to fritz out. Playing one and a half songs, two and a half, one half, (random wakeup playbacks), finally it automatically set itself to nap mode and the alarm started going off every 60 seconds and nothing would stop it. Even tried unplugging it and pulling out the battery, then reassembling it. It never stopped resetting itself to nap mode! It has been an awful experience."
3,It's OK,It's very loud and does not take up much space. If u r interested in using it for your ipod only it's a great buy!the radio being built in the power cord wasn't a good idea it makes it difficult to pick up some stations. Otherwise i liked the product over all and was not disappointed in my purcahse
2,Too many buttons,"Groping for the alarm button in the morning is not easy. There are way too many buttons too close together make it user hostile.We returned external speakers we bought for this thinking they had a buzz in them. The buzz was from the radio, not the external speakers.The clock light is way too bright.I will be shopping for a replacement."
2,Beacon in the darkness,Loved everything about how it worked and the little things it could do but because it was so very bright with that blue digital light we had to return it because you couldn't sleep in the room with it. So sadly it had to go back and my wonderful Christmas present was a failure. If you require a dark room this is not the clock for you.
2,Nice looking but poor features.,"This doesn't have a tone control, or a stereo/mono switch, a remarkable oversight. There is usually less static in mono mode, but because this radio doesn't have this option, you'll almost always be hearing more static/noise than you want, unless you're always tuned into a very close station. Also, volume levels 1-15 are basically all the same, and even the higher ones aren't loud enough. It does have a sleep and nap timer with 1 minute increments, a highly desireable and rare feature, and also an input jack for non-ipod mp3 players, but the shortcomings I described don't compensate for this. I'll return this tomorrow."
1,horrible humming sound!,"I bought this to have something to play my iPod in the bedroom. However, when this thing is turned on, there's a horrible 60Hz humming sound, which means it's impossible to play it at low volumes. I've tried moving it to different outlets and moved it to different spots around the house, so it's not environmental. The problem occurs for both the radio and the iPod.Don't waste your money on this product! I can't believe Emerson didn't at least try it before releasing this faulty product!"
5,Great system,"I was given this as a gift and I use it primarily for my iPod. It works with both the older iPods and the new iPod touch - and the BEST BONUS - it charges the iPod touch (without even having to take off my protective case for it!). It of course charges the older iPods, but it is the only one of my various iPod stereos (for different rooms of the house) that will charge my new iPod touch. Not even my $300 Bose will charge my iPod touch! =( There are also many other options besides iPod use. Great product. Haven't had any problems with it at all. Highly recommend."
