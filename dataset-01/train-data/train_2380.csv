4,Rowling's done it again!,"Order of the Phoenix is much different from the previous 4 Potter books. Phoenix is much darker, and dealing with much darker themes. It is a transitional book, moving us from the innocence of the first 4 and onto the unknown of the next 2. There probably won't be anymore small time childish adventures for Harry et al. Now he's going to have to focus on the biggie.Harry has grown up, and has finally gotten angry for being kept in the dark about the things going on around him.The only notable disappointment for me, was that Draco Malfoy has fallen to the backburner. He is a character with much potential, no matter which way he would be taken, but in Phoenix, Harry just seems to have outgrown the petty bullying of Malfoy, and Malfoy does nothing but bully...Oh well, perhaps later, perhaps not at all.Filled with her own often dark humor, Rowling has put forth the pivotal Harry Potter novel. Where she will go with the final 2, only she knows."
4,Thoroughly Enjoyable,"I like the Harry Potter books, though I only recently got in to them after seeing the two movies. While the first few books are fairly innocent, it's obvious the novels are growing up with Harry himself. This one was much darker than the previous books and scared me quite a bit!The story was interesting, once I started reading it I couldn't put it down. I wanted to know what crazy rule Dolores Umbridge was going to instill upon Hogwarts next. Once Harry starts taking private lessons from Professor Snape, the book gets extremely good. After that, I REALLY couldn't put it down! I was slightly disappointed in the ending, it just didn't seem right to me. Overall, great book. While not as great as some of the others, it was definitely a fantastic read. I can't wait for #6!"
3,The fifth and LEAST exciting of the series,"I was one of the excited multitude who preordered this book from Amazon.com. But unlike the previous installments where it took me a few days to consume, this edition took me more than four months to finish! It definitely was NOT hard to put down.While we are introduced to several new characters, and a loathsome new villain(s)in the new Hogwarts DADA teacher & the ministry of magic, the rest of the book was full of episodes where Harry's constantly frustrated at not ever knowing what's going on. The boy who lived is also the boy least or last to know! Hmmm, no wonder he's always mad at someone in this book. Oh well, at least Neville Longbottom gets to see some action here!Well, here's hoping the 6th & 7th installments are better!"

Oh well, at least Neville Longbottom gets to see some action here!Well, here's hoping the 6th & 7th installments are better!"
5,Takes me back....,"This book was incredible. It made me feel like I was a angsty and emotional teenager again. It also took me back to when dealing with girls was confusing and talking to a girl was almost impossible. The plot and storyline was straightforward and I have never read a book that made me change ages like that. I don't want to give a longer review because I would hate to give away plot, but it was worth reading to me. It brings out new facts about Snape, James and Lily Potter, and the rest of the crew that is close to Harry.I couldn't put it down from the time I purchased it to the time I laid it down completed. It was great. Now I just have to wait for the next one."
4,How Can You Really Rate An Icon?!?,"I have seen and re-seen both movies, but this is the first Harry Potter I have listened to. It seems that Rowling continues to push the envelope on the story length that her audience can bear. At 23 CDs she not only has to remind the reader from book to book what has transpired, but even within the book there are several repeated descriptions. Is it heresy to say I could have used some abridgement. Plus, how many descriptions of Hermoine knitting clothes for house elves we really need?I also found it particularly tedius that it took over a whole CD after the climax for Dumbledor to explain to Harry what had transpired.One of the things that never really came across in the movies, but was apparent in this book is the portayal of magic as beauracracy i.e. the ministry of magic and all their departments and decrees (how British). I did enjoy some of the newly introduced magical creatures, especially the festrils."
4,The spirit of Harry Potter,"Harry Potter, the biggest book in America. I too have been caught in the Harry Potter craze. Having read all of the books, in order, several times, I found that J.K Rowling creates a rhythm between the books, so that you feel like you are a part of Harry's life. However, I thought the flow of Harry's life was disturbed in the fifth book. Harry has been at Hogwarts for four years know. Now, in his fifth year, we meet new characters that we have never even heard of before. I felt that there were so many other characters that Rowling could have developed instead of inventing new ones. The readers have almost no information about Padma Pattil; however, we have seen her before; same story with Semes Finnagin. Perhaps her reasoning will be revealed in the next book."
4,Good but not the best.,After book 4 I could not wait for 2 years to get my hands on book 5. JK built up the story so well at the end of Goblet of Fire that I expected Order of the Phoenix to take off. But it didn't infact it took about 700 pages for things to really get interesting. Rowling did deliver the battle between Dumbledore and Voldemort which was long awaited and was second only to Yoda's battle in Star Wars 2. It was just a bit to slow to stand up to Goblet of Fire. Unfortunatly a sad part of the story ruined Prisoner of Azkaban which was long my favorite for being full of hope. However book 5 shattered that hope. I still look forward to 6 and 7 but do not anticipate them the same way I anticipated this one. I still highly recommend it however but if you have read the first four books you really don't need my recommendation do you?
2,Big Disappointment!,"What a disappointment this book is. Halfway through the book I was still waiting for it to pickup and get moving a little faster...my 9 year old even commented that J. Rowling has lost her touch (BORING!). The new characters are good, but it seems that the storyline is lost in the same thing throughout. Nothing special here. I guess we'll stick with the new Lemony Snickett book coming out next month."
4,Simply awesome!,This is a great book.I could not put it down!The series keeps getting better and better.
5,Excellent but very sad,"I just finished reading this book and I am kind of in shock. The best way I can describe it is that everything about the book has grown up a lot. It has a very different tone to it than the previous books and there are many changes and many surprises. Though it was very long, it held my interest very well (I finished in less than 2 days and I practically only stopped to sleep). It provoked a lot of emotion; some parts I was laughing out loud, some (many actually) had me furious, and one part in particular left me crying. A lot of our questions were answered as well and we learn a lot more about the characters, especially the seemingly insignificant ones. It was just altogether a great book and I hope we won't have to wait too long for the next one to come out."
2,Worst One Yet,This is the worst Harry Potter Yet. It is boring and does not hold to what the standards of the last Potter Books were at....
3,Not as good as it hopefully gets,"I guess it was an essential part of the whole series, but I was disappointed with its editing... It seemed like Rowling could have made it a 100 pages shorter and still gotten her point across (the last chapter was unnecessary). Another thing about it was that this book was all about Harry Harry and more Harry which made everybody else incl his best friends take a back seat. One of the things I and my friends always enjoyed was how Rowling brought out Ron and Hermione's characters and expressions and in this book you were just left hanging about what they thought and felt. I hope Book 6 turns out to be much better. I am a big HP fan but I guess the OOTP was really not worth a whole 3 year wait."
3,A confused Harry and a confusing story,"I have been looking forward to the 5th book very much for over months, and I was reading it all the day,and although I must admit that it's really exciting and you simply can't put it down - well, on the whole, it's a bit disappointing. What I really missed was the usual funny and good athmosphere - it was tense and a bit confusing and irritating. i think this book is just a bit too dark in every point of view.And the character of Harry is really annoying - if he continues behaving this way Dudley will be a nice little boy compared to him.And I think the story isn't satisfactory- It's a bit like it was just knocked up. About 500-600 pages are needless and Voldemort just appears on the scene and disappears in an irritating and strange way.And that prophecy- not a big thing...And what's the worst - one of the best characters die!It's a pity!But, otherwise, I think it's a good book and really worth reading!"
3,diasppointment!,Like many others I eagerly awaited the Order of the Phoenix. I had my own theories about what it was that Dumbledore had to tell Harry and raced through the book to try and find out the big secret. At the end I was very disappointed. I think more because the other books were so good and I had expected much more from this one. A tip for JK Rowling - bring Sirius back for the next book!
2,Long and boring,"I have read all five of the harry potter book and I have even read the first four to my little sister. However the book seem to be getting worse as they go. The order of the phoenix is the worst of the five. Nothing exciting happened during the first 500 hundred pages or so. They could have made this book half as long and it would have been twice as good. If you have a lot of time on your hands and you have read the other four and want to keep up with the books then I would read it, but there are a lot better books to read for your summer reading. If you do not have lots of time on your hand and your not 14 or under don't read it."
5,The Boy Who Lived is Back!,"Harry Potter returns at last! Harry at 15 is more fascinating than ever and along with Harry we are watching Hermione, Ron, Ginny, Neville and a new character grow up at Hogwarts and deal with the return of ""You-Know-Who"" with utter fascination.Of course there's a new Defense against the Dark Arts teacher to deal with-and she's a doozy. Much beloved Hagrid, Dumbledore and the entire Weasley family continue to have a profound effect on Harry's life.There are quite a few surprises including new characters, which is to be expected, but (and I never reveal the plot in a book review) the turns of events in this book had me literally reading with my mouth open at 3am.Ever more complex, darker in tone, and increasingly compelling, J.K. Rowling's book will continue to enthrall her readers.I both laughed and cried while reading the Order of the Phoenix and after reading this book I can only hope that I/we don't have to wait 3 more years for the next one. Thank you Ms. Rowling."
2,A whole bag of flobberworms,"Being an avid reader of JK Rowlings previous Harry Potter novels I waited in agony with the rest of you for the latest novel to hit the stands. When the UPS van pulled up outside it was Christmas revisited in our household. Unfortunately, what I had thought to be yet another literary treat produced by the skilled imagination of JK Rowling, turned out to be a seemingly neverending novel that dragged and dragged on. The story line lacked her previous flair, the mood was not just dark but down-right depressing. If you have identified at all with Harry Potter in the previous books then you will find this novel to be like watching someone kick a very moody puppy for hours and hours and hours on end. Concluding this fiasco, the promised death of a main character was disappointingly obvious and relatively pointless, succeeding in not really adding to anything in the story and serving as just yet another kick."
4,Best one yet!,"This is the best Harry Potter book yet. (It's also the darkest but I've been reading The Demonwars, Shadowdale and stuff like that and so I'm used to it.) I only give it four stars because of the character death. I don't have to say anything about the plot or anything because everyone else has! (And to the person who gave it a one and said if you want a cheerful, enchanting fantasy novel read the Discworld books instead of Narnia. They make me laugh!)"
4,Another outstanding Harry Potter Book draws Fans,"Okay, so I admit it. At 14, im a huge fan of Harry Potter. I love this series, and when i got the fifth book, i was anxious to read it. I admit it, i am a little disappointed at the outcome. What acutally happened in the book wasnt what i wanted to happen, but i loved it anyways. This is a great book for any ages, and yes, i am in love with this series."
5,Somethings Missing.....,"I absolutely love the 4 previous books but after book 4, I was hoping I would be able to read what develops or how Ron and Hermione feel about each other. This book gave no insight on the subject. Also, she left out the Yule Ball. I always loved reading who they chose as dates. It also seemed she wrote the suject of Harry and Cho off rather quickly. Still, I loved the book but I think I liked 3 & 4 a little better. I think they were such cliffhangers that you had to keep reading to see what happens. This book, you just read hoping something will happen."
5,"Not the best in the series, but still a page-turner","In this book Harry must fightnot only Voldemort, but many of his former friends in the wizarding world too. The wizarding world is split in half, 1 side believing and preparing for the return of You-Know-Who and the other not. There are more problems in this book than any other. They range from Harry's new, and simply evil Defense against Dark Arts teacher, to girls; and from Hagrid's newest creature, to the death of one of the primary characters. In the face of all this, Harry is not himself. He is much more easily annoyed, and his friendship with Ron, and Hermione seems to be waning.In the end, though in my opinion not the best in the series this book is still a page turner for every page reveals something new about the wizarding world. No Harry Potter fan, or anyone for that matter should pass this book over."
4,It's always darkest before the dawn,"Well, it lived up to the hype. Well written and interesting, the latest installment of the Harry Potter series is significantly darker in tone, much less fun, and shows us sides of the characters we'd hadn't expected to see. If Rowling was trying to show what it's like to be misunderstood, angry, unhappy, and have the whole world against you, well, she nailed it. She has added rich characters whose actions will frustrate you and situtations where you'll see the right thing to do, but no one will seem able to do it. Does it pick up in the end? Sure. Is there a happy ending? Of course. Will I read the next one? Definitely."
3,Too much!,"The Harry Potter series is a smashing read, especially over a long summer. I was swept into the adventure of the 5th book from the first page. But truth be told, by the time I reached the middle, I was ready for Harry to stop belly-aching and get on with growing up. Part of me wonders if J.K. Rowling didn't channel some of her pregnant horomones into adolescent Harry... Nevertheless, this 5th book hardly left my hands until I reached the last page. It was a good read, a little too lengthy, and I have many questions and criticisms about the end. However, I'll save those comments for another place. I don't want to spoil the story for anyone. Hope you enjoy it!"
5,Great Book,"This book was so awesome - definately a great addition to the series. In parts it seems a little drawn out but it was well worth it - I can't wait to read what happens to Harry Potter next. Although, I do hope the next book isnt as long, lol."
3,Harry Potter overly angry,"I was really angry reading this book. I know it was a coming of age story but, Harry was always raging, sullen and blaming everyone else for his outlandish mistakes. In the real world Ron and Hermione would have told him..., Well they wouldn't have been so endearing. Harry was a complete jerk just like the father he saw that he did not like. I was so angry with his blaming Snape even after he knew about his attempt to help. The converation with Dumbledore, WOW!!! I almost couldn't finish the book. I have been around kids coming of age and they still have the ability to be sensitive to others and take responsibility for their actions. I believe Ms. Rowlings was angry with someone whem she wrote this book so she transferred all of her anger into Harry's character. I hope in the next book I hope Harry will again be sensitive to others, especially those who have stood by his side no matter what like; Ron, Hermione, Hagrid, Dumbledore and even Snape."
3,Another New Turn for the H.P. Series,"What happened to the good old days when the H.P. series was light and happy? I miss all the grand old charm of the past book, and though this new book is indeed good, readers be forewarned it is much darker and grows less and less suitable for its younger and younger fans."
5,simply brilliant (no spoiler),"This book exceeded expectations of most people I know and of course the same for me. J.K Rowling just gets better and better at this series. The way she has turned Harry into a 15 year old from the first book....the flowing maturity is very applaudible. The death of ____________ is indeed very sad and quite unexpected, but no more. Albus Dumbledore plays a very important role in this book also. The only disappointing aspect is what is said on the back cover....it has not met up with most people's standards and they expect more. I can hardly wait for book 6!"
5,longer but packed with thrillers,"This fifth book in the series took me more than one day to read unlike the others but had more complexity and layers. Harry now 15 is going through all the angst of adolesence topped off with school, his first girl friend, Cho, all the confusion that brings, not to mention magic and mayhem. After exploring the Ministery of Magic and a reunion of his friends and godfather, Sirus, Harry finally gets back to Hogwarts after a dull, represive summer with his family. This OWL year at school brings more trouble, an extra class, a secret society and many puzzling , confusing and unanswered questions. With the help from his trusty friends Harry faces his challenges and learns valuable lessons about his family, friends and himself."
3,Thrilling but Disappointing (The Series Goes Mad),"The problem with the fifth Harry Potter book is that it is both thrilling and disappointing. Thrilling in that it provided a great ride, but disappointing in that it failed to live up to realistic expectations. There was plenty of action, drama, and twists and turns to keep you hooked. However, the problems of a bit too much acting out of character for some protagonists and a dragging pace determined not to tell the reader anything began to hamper the story. And, most importantly,the main problem lies in the fact that we are left at essentially the same place as we were after the fourth book, save a prophecy or two. But, still, recommended for fans of Harry Potter and good books who will encounter an enjoyable read.:)"
5,Return to Hogwarts,"Yes, I read the Harry Potter book last night. The book was absolutely humongous, and there was so much information to process, that at some points it was confusing. However, the fifth book is a stunning combination of the first four, bringing everything into play again.Almost everything that has been hoped for in the last three years appears in this book. Although I found the ending to not be up to par with the others, we do still find out more information (although how JK finds more information in the plot, I have no idea). Ron is keeper for the Gryffindor team; the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher will eventually become High Inquisitor; and Harry becomes more and more competent as a wizard (except in potions and later occlumency).This book was awesome ... what can you say to describe the Harry Potter books? My sister currently has it, but I know that I'll be reading it again adn again until I know it like the back of my hand."
2,"hem, hem...dissatisfied muggles, unite!","The Ministry of Magic almost got us...I thought that this forum would be overrun by diehard fans who can't see past the magic dust. I'm glad to read about the honest opinions. Blood and ashes, I thought I'd have to bow low and approach The Quibbler!No, this wasn't the darkest, hair-raising , most exciting installment. Those who claimed to have read the previous books several times--read The Goblet of Fire once more! Nice and slow now, and this time immerse yourself in the magic. See if the death in this book(5) would compare to the demise of a child (or a teenager, if you like).One happy note, though. I was glad to see Ginny Weasley resurface from her trauma. After not reading much about her in books 3 and 4, her character here is most refreshing--a good counterjinx to the drawn out storylines.Hopefully, Rowling would throw this in Fawkes' perch so that it might be reborn from the ashes!"
5,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,Rather dark and I worried alot about Harry but everything turned out O.K. I love Jim Dale's telling of the story.
5,J.K. Rowling Pulls It Off Beautifully!,"First of all, I'm an avid HP fan and in all honestly, I had some serious doubts about whether or not this book could possibly live up to the creative imagination of the first four. I needn't have worried--I couldn't put it down. It's a long one, nearly 900 pages, but she writes so vividly, the pages simply fly by as she literally paints Harry's 5th year for the reader. Throughout both this book and whole Harry Potter series, Rowlings' gracefully maintains the feel, style, color, and attitude that were so delightful in the first as she lets us, the readers, a little further into her world.In light of the goings on in the wizard world, this installment is significantly more intense than the first four, with Harry and gang dealing with more adult situations: hormones, anger, jealousy, the whole bit, (hey, they're fifteen, what do you expect?) and I thoroughly enjoyed watching them grow throughout their 5th year. I hope others enjoy this book as much as I have."
3,Needs some editing,"It will take some doing for JKR to equal the brilliant Book 3, Prisoner of Azkaban. While this one wasn't bad, it was bloated. Some good editing would have made the story more taut, and with a better flow. I agree with one reviewer who said there was an awful lot of standing around and talking, blah, blah, blah. I don't think there was good inter-character development. And even my 11 and 14 year old sons got extremely annoyed with her constantly using the same characterizations...Luna Lovegood always saying things ""vaguely,"" everyone shuddering and wincing when Voldemort's name is mentioned, etc.There was little of the cleverness and light comic relief she is known for; everyone seemed constantly in a bad mood. I also thought some plot elements were superfluous, such as the Grawp the giant. There could have been more quidditch, too. I was disappointed that she killed off an important character. Still, it's a fast 900-page read so I'm confident she'll find that magic again."
4,Decent Book,"This book took a dramatic turn from the nearly carefree excitement of the first couple of book. Harry was constantly paranoid. This shift puts the book in a seperate catagory from the first two. It is quite thrilling, I read it in two days. It is a bit more grown up from the last four, but it is still on track."
4,Great Entertainment!,"The newest Harry Potter is one of the fastest 870 page reads you will find! It is filled with intrigue and growing pains as Harry struggles to come to grips with his past and future. His successes and failures with the girls in his life are a nice touch - very realistic - who hasn't been there? This latest chapter is certainly the darkest in the series, and there is little hope for the mood to lighten any time soon. If you are looking for a quick read and Harry's adventures, this book is definately for you."
3,a little disappointed,"After reading books one through four, I felt that each book surpassed the former in creativity, wit, and character development. Unfortunately, I think that Rowling may have hit her peak with book four, The Goblet of Fire. The characters in book five, The Order of the Phoenix, often seemed disjointed, and at times I was not sure which character to root for. Perhaps the moodiness and rebelliousness exhibited by Harry is simply Rowling's attempt to portray Harry's struggle through adolescence, but I think in doing so Harry has lost some of the traits which made him so appealing in the beginning."
5,Excellant!!! Great Villain!!,"Excellant Story With a terrific Villain in D. Umbridge. The whole girl trouble thing got a little annoying. I mean, Harry was ok, if not a bit of a baby, but this broad he is fawning over is annoying......The ending of this book was a little anti-climactic, but all in all - a very good book!The death in the Goblet of Fire was much more gut-wrenching than this book's death...."
2,I was disappointed after such a long wait.,"I am twelve and have read all the books cover to cover. It took me until today to finish this very long and somewhat boring book. Harry has become nasty and the other characters are not much better. I have seen a lot of the sentences in other books, and the magic has left both the plot and the writing. I think Mrs Rowling should make the next book shorter and better."
2,The many tantrums of Harry,"I've been waiting for this book for a year -- should've have tried one of the ""alternate"" sequels that have been burgeoning around the globe instead.I spent two nights suppressing my gagging reflex at the new Harry Potter's many tantrums and the ridiculous build-up where the author kept piling on the problems, incrementally making his life completely unliveable in the hope that the end would be spectacular. The end was rotten and the only reason I can see for Rowling to weep after writing the extremely predictable, over-hyped ""death"" was because it was so badly written. The explanations following the death were even worse.This book did to the Harry Potter series what the Phanton Menace did for Star Wars. I couldn't stand any of the principals by the end of the book."
2,Longest (and most boring) of the series,"Hey, I'm no Harry Potter maniac, but I really dig reading the books when they come out. They are so much fun! I've read several of them more than two or three times. It's been a satisfying series.Until book 5.Five HUNDRED pages of nothing happening. Five hundred.I don't care if Harry became kind of jerky. He's a teenager. It's only appropriate. That wasn't my problem with this book.The previous books have been action packed, funny, and interesting. This book just drags and drags, and it actually becomes painful to read at some parts.My only hope is that it was an inevitable bridge to the next, more interesting book."
5,geting away from the childrens books,"As the series progresses the subjects of the books become less apealing to children and more abealing to adults. if you liked the fist 2 or 3 books you may not like the next few, they become deeper then just an amaginary world where anything is posible. i like the 5th book more then anything up to this point because their are serious repercutions for the characters actions. we see more flaws in the caracters and more internal conflicts that get inthe way of solving the major conflicts. this to me is more exiting then having a perfict character that can do enything without breaking a sweat."
3,Best one yet? Doubt it.,"I love the HP series. Do not get me wrong but I found in this book what I had feared in the 4th. book and never materialized. It offers no surprise ending, no far fetched mystery,and it offers lots of repeticious and superfluous characters. A reduction of its comedic responses and situations and an increase in a contradictory and dual personalities in both Harry Potter and Dumbledore. The myth has been shortened and the plot simplified. It is what most of ut feared but that never materialized before because I think J.K. Rowling is stupendous author."
5,"Amazing, as always...","After an extremely long wait, 'Harry Potter & The Order Of The Phoenix' is finally out. And it was well worth the wait. This book isn't only the longest one in the series so far, but it is the 'deepest' one. Not only did Harry grow up, but J.K Rowling has written a much more 'grown up book' than before, to match Hary's growth. Don't worry, we still get a lot of the details about life at Hogwarts that made the previous books so charming. But we also see that the wizarding world isn't black and white: good people can come from good families, but people we thought were good might also have their wild side. That adults can make mistakes (even out of the best motives) and might not be able to reveal their reasons when you ask. But most of all, this book shows the importance of values like family, friends, loyalty, and most of all - love."
4,when's the sixth one coming out?,"Order of the Phoenix is a good read; nothing more nothing less. Some people complain that it is just too long. I would tend to agree. One of my more disgruntled friends put it eloquently ""Just split it into two chapters: Harry is angry and Dumbledore is weird""Although I agree that many repetitive parts about Harry's teenage angst could have been slashed, I still feel that this did not spoil the book simply because of Rowling's skill. Her smoothly flowing storylines and a steady supply of wisecracks (the Weasly twins) are what prop this story up and prevent it from becoming a tedious bore. In fact, I found fault with the Harry Potter movies because the script cut so much of the humour that is inseperably part of the books' lure.The best part of the book in my opinion is that it finally reveals the secrets that have we have been pining for since Book 1. So I wouldn't mind the next one being equally long as long as Rowling can tell us a good story."
3,Not as good as 3 and 4,"Although this was a pleasant read (as all Potter books are) I felt that Rowling repeated herself too much. The school year, arguments between Harry and Draco, arguments between Ron and Hermione, blah, blah, blah. Its exactly the same as all the other books. Even Fred and George could have made more appearances and been funnier. Usually they are so funny - not so much this time. Not a very well planned out book. I think she only wrote this book to tell us about the land of the dead or whats behind the veil.The only interesting part in the book was were sirius died and even though that is the case I'd prefer he didn't.Anyway, from my point of view this book was a disapointment."
4,The best book ever,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoeix is number five out of a seven book series. What I don't like adout this book was that the begining was so long. What I also did'nt like that Harry was exspelled just because he cast a spell to help his cosin witch he dosen't like. What I liked about this book was that Harry left his aunt and uncle even thought he was exspelled from Hogworts. I also liked that Harry got to see his friends this year. This is what I like and dislike.
4,Almost as good as book 3,"First, I have to say I obsessively read this book in less than 24 hours. I was entertained throughout. I thought all of the characters developed well, and are really beginning to show the strains and pains of being 15. Harry especially is beginning to feel the isolation and misunderstood-ness that many 15 year olds feel. Although, all of the characters retained the same core personalities that make them special. The story is interesting in that for the first time Harry doesn't save the world from Voldemort, but is tricked by him and almost (needlessly) gets himeself and others killed. In fact, someone does die, but it wasn't who I thought it would be. The death adds another layer to the continuing plot and it should be interesting to see how it affects Harry in the last 2 books. Overall, a smashing story that is hard to put down. It does justice to that magical world. Bring on book 6!"
3,great book,"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix by J.K. Rowling is a great sequel to the series of wonderful books. You begin the book in the middle of Harry's summer at his aunt's and uncle's house in England. Early in the book Harry is put in danger of being expelled. This causes many problems with other characters like Dumbledore. Although the middle section of the book is boring and slow it is very important to read sothat you understand the rest of the book. You also need to pay attention to small details and ideas. Like when Harry leaves the Dursley's, you need to pay attention to where he goes and the people that are there. You need to read the other four books before you start this one so that you understand the terms and characters in the book. I loved this book, and I would highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys a long read and fantasy books."
4,Harry Potter 5,This book was good but it just wasn't as interesting as the other ones. It was too long of a wait. It took so long to come out that I found other books to read that I am a lot more interested in than the 5th Harry Potter book.
4,"Why would the ""Weapon"" be a weapon?","I enjoyed this book and found it hard to put down. But I'm confused about the key element that drives the plot -- the so-called ""weapon"" that Voldemort seeks. How would Voldemort benefit by acquiring the weapon? He knows the difference between Harry and Neville. He knows Harry has extraordinary power. He already wants Harry dead. Would anything change if he acquires the weapon? Would his goals change? Would he be more powerful? The entire plot was based on the promise that it would be a great calamity if Voldemart acquires the weapon. I don't see the calamity."
5,Great Book,I like This Book better than all the rest. The imagery in my mind existed better from this book than all the rest
3,Decent read but I don't believe Rowling's the author,"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is a moderately enjoyable read, however, it contains almost none of the style of her previous works. The characters are much more shallow, Harry is constantly whining, and the book is a bit too long. I got about a quarter way through and thought ""this doesn't read at all like the previous books in the series"" The vocabulary is completely different as well as the rhythm of the story. Either J.K. Rowling took some writing courses (while she was courting, marrying, and honeymooning), or there were one or more different writers involved with this book.All in all it was enjoyable, if not a bit darker than her previous works. I'd recommend this book, but only if you've acquainted yourself with the four previous installments"
4,"Drawing Down the Moon on the ""Order of the Phoenix""","With an incorporeal spirit in the end, Rowlings enchants readers spellbound by apogee to perigee of monstrous sadness inaugurated in the ""Order of the Phoenix"", questioning this epic to be too lurid for younger readers.Binding friendships with the Rowlings characters radiates a true sense of loss to the reader as writing progresses, making the series ordained as classical literature.As the sun also rises when there are such brave friends to be met, Rowlings comical wit and tomfoolery replenishes reader with cheering charms and spite.Pearls of wisdom forlorn under dark waters acquisition bewitched moonbeams charms the reader to apparate by this port key and no other, as Rowlings is resolved to compel the reader in shadow until the twilight of the witching hour on the 7th book."
5,Best Harry Potter book yet,"This is the best Harry Potter book yet. Really, it's amazingly good. I had tears in my eyes many times throughout the story. I only wish it could have been longer--now that I'm finished with it, I really miss reading it. I'm extremely grateful to J.K. Rowling for having written this book, because reading it was one of the most wonderful experiences I've ever had."
5,"Not the Best of the Five, but Still a Great Book",J.K. Rowling has done it again. Order of the Phoenix was a highly enjoyable book full of ups and downs and could match any soap opera for the amount of drama it contained. Though I wouldn't necessarily say that the fifth book was the best of the five...It was still a great book that I would highly recommend to anyone. The series has been full of adventure and while this book certainly has it...it seems a bit more subdued. I can't see this one being a movie as it seems much more of a drama than the action packed plots of the previous four books. If you're a Harry Potter fan you will definitely enjoy Order of the Phoenix. IF you're new to the series you will definitely need to start with Book 1 as each book builds off of the previous volume.
3,Worst book of the series!,"The book was not all that it turned out to be, it was not worth the wait and time to read it. The author seems to need to organize herself a little and could have made it a little more enjoyable. Although she did spend a lot of time writing it, it to me seems that not much effort was put into it. I was disappointed with the problems Harry was having and why things never seem to work out for him. With all the time she had made us wait I expected a much better book that did not seem to rushed. All in all it was fun to read, and some questions are answered but not a whole lot. Enjoy!"
2,What a disappointment...,"We all looked forward to the latest Harry Potter installment, but I felt it was very disappointing. There was NO cohesive plot, just a lot of babble. I kept waiting for something to happen, but it never did (at least not until the end!). What I love about reading, that feeling of being on the edge and not being able to wait to turn the next page to see what happens, just never happened with this book. Harry was surly, rude and disrespectful to everyone, even his friends. If I had not wanted to know who died, I would probably not even have finished this book. I also feel that this book was written strictly toward being a quick, cheap movie that will put more $$$ into JK Rowlings already over-flowing pockets. The death of what I consider to be a minor player was not worth the hype we've endured for so long. Over all, this was a very disappointing book and I hope JK Rowling forgets about her pocketbook and goes back to writing great fiction for our kids and ourselves."
2,"Disappointing, tedious and too conflicted","Book V was disappointing. I read it page to page. It seems like the author wanted to show the turbulent world of the adolescent but there seemed no end to the upheavals and barriers that they faced. Harry was always angry, Hagrid was always hurt, and everyone else was chained to uncertainty. The book did not give the message of hope like the others did. It was too long, the kids did not learn too many new things considering they were in the fifth year and Dumbledore's behavior was illogical and out of character. It left me feeling disappointed and unfulfilled."
2,Parsimonious,"Disappointing, long-winded plot barely inches the meta-story forward. A weird shift in a major character who is killed in offhand manner. Extremely forced dialog and emotional content. Cartoony bad guys, cartoony good guys and a mired-in-the-muck plotline. And hundreds of pages of much ado about nothing.At 200 pages into the book, I was getting worried. I had read reviewers that were unimpressed with the book and I began to fear they might be right. Mostly I was sad to see the complexity of the story not resolved or advanced and nothing new revealed that we did not know or could not have guessed. Harry in Book 5 seems less grown up than Harry in Books 1-4. Very sad. I hope JK Rowling can get her Groove Back."
1,we waited for this?,Very disappointing. JK Rowling has done much better work but after finishing this I feel as if she wrote it just to make a quick buck or satisfy a contractual obligation. Shallow plot and pithy use of language do not make a book. Maybe once she realizes this she can return to the magic.
1,Boring!,This was the worst one yet. I was really looking forward to getting this book and it was a big let down. The important stuff wasn't explained in detail but all of the trivial stuff was. What's up with that? I could care less about half the stuff she drags on and on about. It almost seemed like she was just trying to make the book longer. The ending was good but not very well explained.Good luck staying interested in this one!
1,What was that all about?,"The plot had more holes in it than swiss cheese...two of the best characters (Hagrid & Dumbledore) were hardly seen or heard from...the ""reveal"" at the end didn't explain anything...I'm just hoping this volume is a ""transition"" to provoke questions that will be answered in 6 & 7...otherwise, this book is simply ""The Goonies"" meets ""The Craft."""
1,Biggest Dissapointment,"When I heard the title of the new book, I was looking forward to it. After seeing the size of the book, I was eager to get my eyes through it. This book was the biggest dissapointment so far :( It was pointless! We learn that Harry's going to kill Voldemort if he doesn't kill Harry first. SO WHAT?! That's a GIVEN is it not?! How dare she write such a long, pointless book. And what was it with Cho and Sirius?! Surely she could have written a lot better. Her best book was Prisoner of Azkaban. Her worst was this. If you're a big fan of Harry Potter, go ahead and read this .... Otherwise, don't bother. It doesn't get you anywhere."
4,"Does not seem to be for kids anymore, but good for Adults","When I read ""The Goblet of Fire (Book 4)"" I felt that the themes were becoming more mature. Perhaps as Harry matured the themes do too? Book 5 seems to follow this trend. The book has taken on an even more mature theme dealing with aspects such as death, anger, frustration, changes and unpleasantness. I enjoyed it but it felt dark and serious most of the time. I would be hesitant to give this book to a child under 14 to read, which is why I gave 4 stars instead of 5. As an adult reader I would give it 5 stars however."
5,None,I have always loved harry potter books and this one just adds to that. At first I didn't like it much because they kill off my favorite character (darn them!) but now that I've read it a couple times it's my favorite one.
4,Good book,"OotP was a good book in the Harry Potter series but it is definitely not intended for JK Rowling's child audience. It is much darker and full of angst. If you are a fan of the Harry Potter series like I am, you will most likely enjoy it, but my favorite is still the 3rd book. I wouldn't start with this one if you haven't read any of the others however. Start with the first book or the movies. You may follow the plot but you won't enjoy it nearly as much."
5,The best Harry Potter book yet,"I am definetly giving this book two thumbs up. It is another thrilling adventures in which Harry and his friends, Ron and Hermione (including a few others), have to deal with Prof. Umbridge, Voldemort himself, the death of a main character which none of us would have thought would die so soon, and they have to guard a prophecy. You will love this book. I can't wait for book six and seven to come out."
3,It was pretty good,"I did think this book was okay, but it didn't seem nearly as realistic as the other books. It does have a very nice plot, with many twists and turns, and the trademark JK Rowling red herring at the end. Most likely, if you enjoyed the other books, you will like this. However, do note that the characters have new personalities, and old traits are overstressed. Harry...frankly, Harry acts like a psychomaniac for part of this book. But really, you will most likely enjoy it. I wish i could have given it three and a half, though."
3,good and bad for Harry Potter LSMS,"i like the harry potter books because it shows courage, bravery, and loving. A person needs to know how to be brave and courages. it also helps kids to read better and help them use their imagination.one thing bad about it is that it shows things tht are not reolistec and kids try to imaitate something from the movie. doing this has killed some people and also serouisly ingured many."
4,Jo does it again,"Harry's adventures continue in book five with an astounding sensitivity to the rest of the Potter saga. After a three year wait, Potter fans will be delighted that the main character and his compatriots are growing in feeling and sensitivity as we all do at that precarious time in our lives. There is real angst that Harry feels for the way his life is progressing. The book is very easy to read and somewhat a relief after book four and all it's revelations and going back and forth through time. Mrs. Rowlings has a knack for us interested in the mystery of Voldemort's reappearance and the lack of interest by the Ministry without Ms. Marpling us do death with pages of supposition and theories batted around by Hermione and Harry, as has happened in her previous work. It was a great thrill and no disappointment. How long until we have to wait for more!"
3,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,"I was disapointed by this book. I found it ponderous. It moved very slowly. Yes we understand that harry is angry, but really 200 pages of anger could have been gotten rid of. Any of the other books could have been read on their own as a stand alone book..The order of the phoenix just feels like a bridge. It doesn't have the same magic."
5,Great!,"The fifth book lives up to expectations and offers novelty; although, it lingers in some areas. Even with some parts hogging too many pages, the book goes quickly. It is fresh the most original of Rowling's series."
5,They keep getting better!,I received it and read it in 2 days. It was amazing! From the first pages it keeps you in suspense and pushes you on to read more. It's very hard to put down. The main characters are developed further and the adventures are more intense than ever before. Rowling does another excellent job sucking you into Harry's world and keeping you interested from page 1 to page 870! Wonderful read! Can't wait for #6.
5,"Still awesome, but...","Order of the Phoenix keeps up the excellent standard previously set by Rowling. Read it in two sittings, couldn't put it down. That said, I have one minor complaint...why has Harry turned into such a self-centered, sniveling, whining little crybaby? In this book he is constantly whining and complaining and feeling sorry for himself and it gets kind of old...shouldn't he be maturing as he gets older? Shouldn't all his previous experiences have helped him to be less selfish and less apt to complain as he gains more perspective each year? Why the sudden regression? I hope she fixes this with the next book. Two straight books full of Harry's whining new personality will begin to really annoy me. But other than that I still loved the book."
3,Not good enough...,"I was ecstatic to read this book because I was so pleased with the previous four... but The Order of the Pheonix was a big let down. This book lacks adventure and action. Harry's character is not the same, he is unpleasant and gets very annoying. The book is long, drawn out, and down right boring. I will still be reading the 6th Harry Potter book when it is realeased because I am such a huge fan of the first four in the series... but I sure hope, for all our sakes, that it's a big change from the 5th."
1,Did anyone else felt it was a waste??,Hi I could not wait for book number five and stood in line from 8 pm till midnight to purchase the book and finished reading it in a mere 4 days and what a rip off it was!! It only got remotely interresting after the first 600 pages and MAN can HARRY GET ANY MORE WHINNEY??? Was Rowling in a bad mood when she wrote this book? Well it seems so and she [messed] up! This is where my collection end!
5,"dark, but entertaining","Like everyone else, I've awaited the release of this book eagerly, and I confess I enjoyed it immensely. Her writing style is smooth and engaging as usual, and the newly introduced characters are funny. She expertly transitions Harry and his friends into young adulthood, depicting their confusion, love, and anger flawlessly. Although it was not one of her best books, it was still a very good read."
2,Not worth the long wait!,"This book was far too slow, without much semblance of a plot. It lacked the pace and ingenuity of the third and fourth books, and was much too long. Obviously a must for Harry Potter fans, but far from the best of the series."
1,Harry Potter is overated,"I do not like Harry Potter. I find the books dense, confusing, and senseless. I do not understand the craze for these picks. I find them boring and stupid."
1,Emperor's new clothes drycleened,"So people are realising that this is poorly written, uninspired, unimaginative tripe? Now that is reassuring.Why don't you try a little Tolkein (or even Terry Pratchett), rather than inflict this on your lobotomized cranial cavity?"
2,Highly disappointed,"I loved all the other Harry Potter books, but I could barely stand to read this one.It was too long for one thing...it took literally 200 pages JUST to get them to Hogwarts. 200 pages is longer than some full books.I was highly disappointed, and do NOT recomend this book. Maybe the hard-core Harry Potter fans will like it, but to anybody who isn't completely obsessed, you should pass."
1,Why didn't this take place in a restaurant? It is the ORDER OF THE PHOENIX after all!,"At 3,800 chapters and 255,000,000 words (many of them not even in any earthly tongue!) everyone said this book was too long. Well, I say it's not LONG ENOUGH! I was enraptured by the ten-page description of the various license plates on Privet Drive. I wanted to know MORE about Malfoy's dental records! Why, for example, did he not have that wisdom tooth taken out? Couldn't he have done so with his magical powers? These are delicious details readers are simply clamoring for! To those who say the book's too lengthly, remember, the Brooklyn phone book is a mere page longer, and a much better read!"
2,NO,It was stupid and sad and depressing... but not as much as the 6th season of buffy.Serious died and he was my favorite character and the wierd punishments and umbrige.This is coming from a fan of the books
3,It Should Actually Be 3.5 Stars....,"Its an OK book. Kinda tedious and all. Its really long, its ok for a while then slows, then speeds up, then slows, etc. The climax is also kinda long. The heart of teh climax is pretty good. There are many flaws/holes. A really pathetic part of the book is that it is really predictable. Many people might disagree with me, but if you think for a second once your halfway through the book, the plot unflods to you. Even though i am a fast reader, the book was really long. I was dissapointed when a character died, because he, in my opinion, one of the things that actually kept peole reading the book. I could go on, but i think this is enough to show you my opinion."
4,Good Read,After going through the hype and going crazy to be one of the first ones to read the book i wasnt disappointed. Unlike alot of the others that read the book I enjoyed the fact that this book was so long. the reason being that you have to wait so long for the author to finish the book that when it finally comes you dont want it to end early. I would have given the book 3 stars but i gave it 4 since i had a feeling of completion when i finished this one. for some strange reason i am able to wait for the author to take as long as she wants with the next one. she was able to tie up all the loose ends in this one. you wont be disappointed
5,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,"As always, I find that MS Rowling has a such a unique way of dealing with adult situations in a manner that children can relate to, as with the death of Professor Dumbledor in the sixth book."
3,A tad long.,"After all the hype and waiting, I must admit I was disappointed. Granted, I belong to the ""older generation"" and must continue reading this series to it's conclusion I'm afraid. Once started, one must give one the benefit of the doubt. I'm sure the pre-teen might enjoy it - since the characters are ""age related"", but I have to agree with a previous reviewer who sited concerns for the younger child. I found it just sort of dragged on and on and didn't really draw me into it. I kept wishing she would just get on with it. I'm afraid a lot of the pre-teen readers might walk away with the impression that Harry's behavior is acceptable and continue behaving in a similiar manner. (One must read the story to understand where I'm coming from.) Frankly, at several points I just wished someone would have administered a verbal ""spanking"" and tell him to just behave like a nice person instead of a brat. The conclusion did not justify the length of the book."
4,Too many CDs,I'm a little concerned about the sheer number of CDs!! 23!! I have the previous four books on tape and enjoy the narrator very much.
5,aaawwwsssooommmeee!!!,"i haven't read it yet but i heard the book was frightning,cool,and exciting. why is this book so much though?! i just started,why didn't the the dementor just be done with diddykins?? i think it should have finished him off. diddykins is a weirdo."
1,Totally overhyped,"This book is poorly written and boring. At this point in the series, the characters are starting to get quite weary and shallow. The huge number of characters leads to a painful lack of any real relationship between many of them and reduces any empathy the reader might have had in previous books in the series. All the spells and magical hokus-pokus failed to entertain anyone in our family. I recommend people quit after book 4."
2,Very disappointed.,"This book was very different from the 1st four. I found it hard to get into. It dragged and it was full of anger. Yes, Harry is now 15 and suffering all teenage dilema's but the anger extended throughtout the whole school year. I felt maybe the author just wanted to get the book written as it had been 3 years since the release of book 4 and she really didn't have her heart in it. Maybe she was angry and it carried into this book.I believe the author would not finish the series if there wasn't such a great following. It didn't have nearly the humor of the last books. I was very disappointed although the new character added something to the book. I read the first 4 books 3 times each and have listened to the audio tapes of all books. I doubt I will buy the audio tape of this book nor will I read it a second time. I will not get inpatient for the next book. When it comes, it comes. I feel the author let me down in this installment. It was too long and drawn out. Sorry."
2,Sadly disappointed,"Having read the first four books two years ago I have been anticipating this book for a couple of years now and I was completely unimpressed. The book had a lot of great things going on, but was still completely disappointing. J.K. Rawling sometimes wrote about Harry as though she didn't even know him and the ending was not nearly as climatic as it should have been. Although I love the Harry Potter series, this book was a major let-down. I doubt that it will stop me from reading the next book but hopefully there will be an improvement. For the next book, I hope she spends less time on marketing and more time improving the content of the book."
5,Harry Potter #5,This is prehaps the best book I've ever read!! I've havent been so attached to a book since The Goblet of Fire came out! I thought that after writing four books that there isn't much left to write in the 5th 6th and 7th but I was SOOOOOO...... wrong. JK Rowling is so creative and makes this book so much fun to read for all ages. THe one thing I would advise is read it slow because the next one isnt supposed to come out for a while.
3,This Phoenix fails to rise,"After the first four, this comes as a disappoinment and hardly warrants the media circus that surrounded it. Rowling turns Harry into a rather unlikeable character and the story is bogged down by details that do little or nothing to advance the plot.It is clumsy, unwieldy only saved in parts by a truly sinister character in the Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher and George/Fred's prank to crown them all. Hopefully, the sixth book redeems the series but with the abundance of plotholes to tie up, it's hard going for Rowling."
5,The best Harry Potter series ever. Period.,"After spending 22 reading hours completing this Harry Potter and the Order of the Pheonix, non-stop, this is the book that I will never truely forget. Harry's mind takes beyond into a deeper setting where he faces new challanges. A Defense against the Dark Arts teacher who poisoned Harry like honey. Dobby, the house elf, is more concerned with Harry. And the growing threat of Voldemort, almost in the part where Harry almost nearly get killed. Although the book is 870 pages, the story plot goes in a more quicker speed if one reads more. I find the fifth Harry Potter series to be addictive by the story plot, and it was hard for me to stop reading. I recommend this book to everybody, and to me, this is the best Harry Potter series book ever since the Goblet of Fire. Buy it today."
3,Some things explained other questions raised,"I red this book that I had been anticipating for some time with a mixture of excitement and drowsiness, which I guess comes of making a wal-mart run at midnight and reading until 4 A.M. then starting again 6 hours later. I thought that overall it was good, but not as good as book 4. It felt like throughout the series people were growing and changing, and yet either we took a step backwards or the people were always static. Of course some of the background characters have really matured and changed, like Neville, and some things we've been reading about in the other books finally pay off, but it almost feels like what is revealed in this book could and should have taken place in a much earlier novel. The beginning of the conflict between good and evil was sadly anticlimactic. However the talk between Harry and Dumbledore has some truly tense and interesting moments.While I truly enjoy the entire series, This one seems like the weak sister of the group."
4,The best yet,With the release of each new book the Harry Potter series gets more interesting. This book is the best of in series so far and I could not put it down once I bought it. In this book we see Harry growing up even more and having to face more challenges. He becomes more bitter as things begin to happen both to him and around him. And the ending with the death of a beloved character makes you hope that they will not die when you pick up the book and read it again.This is a must read for anyone who has read the other 4 books in the series. I can only hope the sixth book is released in the near future before fans go crazy with anticipation.
3,too slow,"This book was too slow moving for me. I have come to expect faster movement in the story from j k . so not so great. but of course, for harry potter fans, you will want to reaD IT ANYWAY. BUT BETTER SPEND YOUR MONEY ON SOME DELIGHTFUL AND INTERESTING BOOKS LIKE HOLLIS WOODS, THE LIKES OF ME, THE CAMP OF THE ANGEL AND DARING TO BE ABIGAIL, AND THE GILRS."
3,A bit of a dissappointment,"I'm a Harry Potter fan, but after finishing this book last night, I could help but feel that this book is an absolute anticlimax to all the excitement and expectations.Firstly, the book is more about The High Inquisitor of Hogwarts than about The Order of The Phoenix.Secondly, it's just tooooo long with to many unnecessary chapters.Thirdly, it lack the suspense the third and forth books had. The ending is too predictable. It's just a matter of how the book gets us there. And it gets us there by taking to many unnecessary routes....P>Just too bad. After finishing this book, immediately I want to read the next book, so I can be a Potter fan again. In the meantime, I'm afraid it's gonna be another long wait..."
2,Disappointing,"""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"" was a real let down for me. It was really slow and hard to get through. Harry was protrayed as a conceeded little brat, who only thinks about himself most of the time. There were a few good parts in the 800+ page book, but they hardly made the book worthwhile. This is a book you will definetely want to borrow if you want to read it. I hope that the next book will be better written."
3,Back to the dark ages,"I enjoyed it but I thought it would be much better. The new characters are fantastic! The old characters a good too but it is more about Harry than anybody else, and he is one angry and stubborn boy. He blames everybody when it is most of the time his own fault. It is also dark and depressing and to add to it - something really sad happens at the end. I gave it only three stars because the book was a bit disappointing to me after years of waiting. I do recommend it though, but I think it is more for adults now than children."
2,Too whiny.,"Most of the 2 days I spent reading this book I wanted to kick Harry in the face. I found it very disappointing that Rowling found it neccessary to make him the stereotypical teenager, when plenty of people go through adolescence and maintain a normal attitude and way of thinking. There were far fewer comic elements to this book and I missed them sorely. If Harry is just as bratty in the 6th novel, I'll stop reading it halfway through. I think Rowling is abusing her power as an author."
2,Huge downfall from the 4th,I was expecting action like the fourth one but not here .There was just pages of useless detail and so much detail about Umbridge and HOW hARRY DISLIKE HER. by the time i got to page 600 i was thinking of putting the boook down but I finished later. BOOKS : 1 2 3 4 6 ARE WAY BETTER AND HOPEFULLY 7 WILL BE THE BEST.
2,Not suitable for kids!,This book is not suitable for kids! Rowlings seems to have turned from writing a fanciful tale with a little scary adventure to writing horror novels. No wonder the reviews inside the cover feature Stephen King. The Goblet of Fire went over the edge as well. I can't recommend that kids ages 9-12 read past #3 in the series.
2,Read it for the sake of the series.,"Harry whines IN CAPS. Life at Hogwarts sucks.That sums up like 700 pages of this depressing installment.The remaining 170 pages deliver some interesting story development, as there should be after the stunning 4th book, but it's mired in very slow, very depressing, and very repetitive series of events.At least it makes it easy for the movie makers to edit stuff out and leave the good bits in.This one should definively make a better movie than it did a book.Still, read it. The 6th one is good, I just hope the 7th makes better use than the 5th of all the dead tree involved in making 800+ pages."
2,could have been better,"I thought that J.K. Rowling did a fantastic job writing all of her books except the fifth one. The fifth one was sad, depressing and I thought that there could have been a better climax to the ending than what she had written. She had written throughout the first four about this boy who's life was changed and his adventures at hogwarts. The First four were happy and adventuris, then came the fifth book which was gloomy, sad, and very deppressing. The fourth book was so good i expected a better sequal than what was published. J.K. Rowling just had a minor set back, and I still love the all the books. I can't wait till the sixth one comes out!!"
4,Another great book by J.K. Rowling...,"I thoroughly enjoyed the 5th book in the Harry Potter series. Although the book was a little slow in the beginning, it got better and more exciting as I read more and more...by the end, I couldn't read fast enough! It was interesting to see how the character of Harry is maturing. He often seemed grumpy and out of sorts, which was a little disheartening compared to the somewhat happy-go-lucky character we read about in the earlier books. Of course, he is 15, so it is probably somewhat typical behavior. Overall, this older reader (24 years old) thought it was a great book and can't wait for the next in the series to come out!"
5,Dark Tale,"The saga continues but the story darkens. No longer is this a ""children's story"", but a tale of a young man who is dealing with a dark past. He has lost his celebrity status and is viewed as a liar with exagerated stories. Harry is changing, and I fear not for better."
4,Frustration,While i found the book very good it was still hard for me to say that i loved it. I just hate it when its obvious people aren't at fault and they still get punished. It frustrated me that people couldn't see that Harry was a good person. While i was frustrated i couldn't put the book down. I'd still say that this is a very good buy for anybody that follows the Harry Potter series!!
5,Her Best One Yet,"Simply amazing. The 5th installment in Rowling's acclaimed series is an excellent story filled with suspense, darkness, humour, and triumph. I just finished reading it after quickly heading to my bookstore to pick it up. In my opinion, this is her best writing yet. Harry is not as appealing in this story (he's rude to people at times) but mostly all of the other characters are. Each one has so much depth to them, as Rowling achieves heights with each one. I don't want to give away any details because there are some major surprises in the book! All I can say is: READ IT!"
5,Very insightful and a great read,"I am 15 and I find the Harry Potter series very good. I have to strongly disagree with the 12 year old reviewer who gave it a one, how does it disrespect the government or your parents. It does not indirectly or directly say that at all. It teaches that we should be united, like the US stands for. And the people in the book respect thier parents very much, Weaslys for example, your comment is totally irrevelant to the series. I find your comment totally ignorant, you don't want to see the positive outcomes from this series, such as getting young people to read and respect eachother as fans. Your comment is ignorant and I hope you take the books for what they are, fantastic."
4,Not a total escape from reality,"Harry Potter has given millions of children, and adults, an escape from this world into a wonderful, magical place. Books one through four were enjoyable in that even though Harry had hard times (to say the least) there was always a ray of hope. J.K. Rowling seems to have dashed that ray of hope in book five. The reader is left full of regret and deeply saddened.Some people may not even want to continue the series after reading ""The Order of the Phoenix"". If we want reality we'll stick to the local Daily Gazette instead of the Daily Prophet.Our only hope is that J.K. Rowling will ""make it right"" in the sixth and seventh books. If we choose to continue reading the series, that is."
3,"Worst HP book yet, but better than many normal books","It's still a wonderful book by regular standards. But in comparison to the other HP books, this was the worst. It was just sort of a tie in for all of them to remind us of anything we may have forgotten from the past four books and set the stage for the final 2. This did not possess the surprising ending most of her books previously had. It made me very anxious and frustrated, reading it.Harry's supposed to be the hero character. But what happens when you no longer like the hero? Throughout this book I was busy yelling at HP. Teenage angst is horrible to read, and, going through it myself, I believe Rowling stretched it a bit. We may be paranoid, but we're not stupid. He's more of an Artemis Fowl character now, without the genius...Some things didn't quite make sense in this book or didnt fit. Must read for all HP fans, reasons being obvious. Expecting better from the greatest author of our time!"
4,Good book,"Without a doubt this book was incredible. The characters were unforgetable and the description was fantastic, but J.K. Rowling is a thief, hence the reason I only gave it 4 stars. For any Tolkien fans, we all know the similarities are more than just coincidence, I mean Wormtongue/Wormtail, a bodyless power Voldemort/Sauron, The Ents/Whomping Willow, Gandalf/Dumbledore. Although J.K. Rowling is a fantastic writer, her ideas are not entirely original. Great book, but everytime I read it, I can only think that Tolkien is lucky he is not alive to see this. Anyone who wants true originality need look no further than Tolkien. Rowling is a wonderful author."
3,"long development, short climax","I was disappointed in how much time JKR spent developing the new character, the predictably bad Defense against the Dark Arts professor. I thought the climax was hastily rushed through and lacked the depth of her earlier books. I enjoyed the vivid writing throughout - and it's fun to see Harry continue his quest, even if some of the path's seem a bit too well worn and predictable. Not a bad book, but not quite on par with the first 4."
4,Magical!,"Harry Potter and his friends are growing up and facing increasing challenges, not the least of which include the mysteries of a girl's mind. The issues are darker and far more political. Friendships are a bit rockier and there are more secrets. Harry finds out more about adults in his life - they are imperfect and make mistakes. Once again, J.K, Rowling has written a tight, fast moving story, rich in detail and characterizations, with enough mystery and suspense to make it difficult to put down despite its 870 pages and 38 chapters."
5,Phoenix from the flames,"What a book! Bought at midnight on a freezing cold Friday night, we adults stood around too excited to be embarassed. 20 minutes later clutching the book in my greasy paws I started reading. I haven't eaten since! I honestly couldn't put it down.The plot picks up where the fourth left off, with you-know-who still at large and Harry as always with the Dursleys on Privet Drive. This book however follows more closely to the fourth book than the first three as it is HUGELY dark. Harry really grows up in this book and has a few teenage tantrums along the way. About time...We see some of the first signs of romance in Harry's life and we also start to see more of the links between Harry and You-Know-Who. Harry takes his O.W.Ls (Ordinary Wizarding levels) and things at Hogwarts start to go badly wrong.I'm doing my best not to spoil it for anyone, just buy it and read it!"
5,The best book in the series and probably in the world,Its really good. I like the plot and the illustrations go well with it. I like the way that one of the charaters dies. Its very suspenseful.
2,Harry Plodder,"The long awaited 5th entry in the Harry Potter series is a monumental disappointment. In 870 pages, almost nothing of substance happens. And most of what we read is not connected in any way to anything else. We plod through scenes of Harry on a date, the giant Hagrid hides in the forest, etc. And there is nothing in this book that contributes to the overall story of the return of Voldemort. We knew he was back at the end of Goblet of Fire, and by the end of Order of the Phoenix, well, he's basically still just back. Except that he's spent the entire book more or less in hiding while his Death Eater cronies try and get their hands on ""the prophecy"", which tells us no more than we already knew about the characters. And yes, the end of the book leaves us on the dawn of a new wizard war, but we figured that was going to happen at the end of book 4.Skip this installation, and wait for number 6. You'll have missed nothing but a lot of Harry yelling at his friends in bold type."
4,Of course it's good-don't get too hyped up.,"I noticed that I am one of very few to rate this book with anything less than a five. I'm not saying that it wasn't a terrific novel. I am saying that myself and most of my friends would not call it our favorite. Between us, we think the best Harry Potter book would be the third (The Prisoner of Azkaban) or maybe the forth (The Goblet of Fire). Now, just because it's not the best doesn't mean that it shouldn't be read. Definitely read it (if you're into the series) but don't expect too much if you really liked the 3rd and 4th."
3,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,"Hmmm... I liked it a lot, not sure I loved it. Nothing much different, and the usual big ""good vs evil"" scene towards the end is definitely kind of stale.But I read it straight through, enjoyed it enough, and can't wait for the next one.I do hope we haven't seen the last of Fred and George, though!"
4,"Well done, J.K. Rowling!","This was an outstanding read. I gave it 4 stars because, as a children's book it was a little complicated, but as an adult I thought it was fantastic! For those of you who have not yet read this book, you are in for a dramatic, emotional roller coaster, and a chilling end. Mrs. Rowling has a brilliant mind, and it will be ever so sad to see the series end. This book bridges Harry for what can only be his true beginning as a ""manly"" wizard taking control of the world around him in the next book."
4,Good but not Great,"I liked the book a lot. I love the language, the characters and the plot, and is very good. But it doen'n have all the action of the other books. I dont see the point on killing the character that was killed, and I hate Cho Chang. She's not good enough for Harry. I thought JK rowling was going to develop more the Hermione-Ron relationship, and that there was going to be more action, but although the book didnt go that way, I liked it a lot. My favorite is still number 3, and I see this one like an interphase between number4 and number 6. Is a very good book. Of course, the 'its too long' stuff is true. But if youre a good reader, it doesnt matter: I mean, its a book. Books are supposed to have words. So read it and enjoy it!!!!"
5,Amazing Series,"I am not an avid reader, but could not put any of the series down once I began to read the books. I got all 5 books at once and started with Book 1 and did not stop until I had reached the final page of Book 5. I finished the series in about 4 weeks. My only disappointment with Book 5 is that you did not find out how the students did on their O.W.L.S., so I'll have to wait until the next book is published. Excellent choice for any age... I'm 56 and enjoyed the series that I recommend it to all."
2,Harry Potter Gets PMS,"How can a boy change so much over the summer. This book begins the summer after the fourth book leaves off. Within that time Harry Potter goes from being a well mannered and yet mischievous young man to being a spoiled, self centered, and often hard to like, child. Finally, literature has come out with a male character who experiences PMS just like girls do. There are some good parts like bringing back Lupin for one, and seeing some of Snapes childhood, it is interesting. I hope the next one is better because had this been the first book in the series I don't think the publisher would have bought it. The book is a must read if you follow the series and want to understand some key points but the book is disappointing. Nobody is perfect including the author of this book."
4,Best book of the series,This book was great. Only reason i gave it 4 stars instead of five was because i didn't like the way harry is always angry. It is so completely surpriseing that you don't know what is going to happen next.There have been some rumors going around stating that harry dies in this book. Let's just put that one to rest. Harry is not the one to die. I just could not put this book down. I finished it the day after i got it. If you only have 20$ get this book.
4,"Good, but with some Exceptions","The fifth of 7 installments in the Harry Potter series is like my title states. It was fun to read and a great plot, but I disliked Harry having a big attitude about everything later in the book. Other then that, there was a lot of surprises. I, for one, was surprised Ron became a prefect. For me, I think it gets a well deserved 4-star rating."
5,Like Empire Strikes Back of the Harry Potter series.,"So much darker and so much more involved. J. K. Rowling definitely does not disappoint as she lays a path for what may be a conflict like none before in the Harry Potter series. Someone dies, but Harry seems to gain more followers. The characters grow up and face even more problems. The Goblet of Fire and The Order of the Phoenix are both suspenseful and like the Empire Strikes Back of the series - with a terrifying cliffhanger at the end.This book shows that J. K. Rowling is way past just simple book writing for kids. This is a great novel that can involve anyone.Rating: Excellent. Highly recommended to anyone."
5,"Excellent, Exciting, and Thrilling!","The best yet of the series, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix proved to be most exciting. Twisting and turning and leaving me unable to sleep for nearly two days straight, which is the time limit in I finish every book I've ever read. The story really leads you into feeling quite attatched to it's characters, feeling what they feel. Of course, I have come to think on the fact that the story gets rather dreary, sad, and depressing, but I can only hope better things will happen. A page turner for sure for any who are true fans of great literature."
2,"Sadly, not that great","The lead character is no longer interesting, he is simply dour and selfish. There are no clever plot twists and the sense of a great mystery is absent. The wonderful scenes of past books, like the World Cub, are also absent. Furthermore, we learn NOTHING new.What a sad, sad dissapointment."
5,Another enjoyable adventure.,Having just finished the newest offering from J. K. Rowling I must say that this book is a great addition to the Harry Potter series. She keeps you reading until the last page. Her writing just seems to get better every book. Keep them coming.
2,Disappointing,"I am a huge fan of the series. With The Order of the Phoenix, Rowling seems to have lost her way. Specifically, none of the characters are likable, there is no comic or fantastic relief (the Dursley's are hellish, Sirius's home is hellish, Hogwart's is hellish,...), relationships are trivial (I expected a lot more out of Harry/Sirius, and Harry/Cho), and the great prophecy is a total yawn. Most fans of the series could have come up with a more entertaining list of events, plot twists, settings, and character transformations than are contained in this installment.I haven't been this surprised in a bad way since Aliens 3."
2,What a dissapointment,"I've started following Harry Potter when the 1st book was published and nobody had waited for it excitedly. What an excellent series it has been! ""Has been"" is the point here. The 5th book is such a dissapointment! First, it should've been much shorter, there are just too many boring lengthy descriptions/discussions that lead nowhere and do nothing for characters. Second, boy, what an anti-climax ending! I mean, let's think a minute: A prophecy as a weapon???! And what new did we find out from that prophecy? Makes no sense at all. The only good thing about this book is ""that Umbridge woman""."
5,Rowling is our queen,"After the stunning front page review in the New York Times, I wonder who would care to read my two cents worth here. After a marathon weekend reading I was sad because I did not want the wild ride to end ever. It is absolutely stunning how, novel after novel, JK Rowling has simply not lost her touch to weave this magical world. During a recent weekly business program on CNN an analyst suggested that probably the book has become so hyped because of the marketing muscle of all the big corporations. To which a NY Times journalist responded that people are not buying Harry Potter because Warner Bros or Scholastic cooked it up in their marketing programs but it is because of Rowling's writing prowess. And truer words were never spoken.It is simply amazing that she has simply not given into any commercial pressures and stuck to her vision (I am sure editors must have asked her to reduce the size of the book). Yes Rowling is our queen."
4,"not as exiting as the other ones, but still fun to read","It was fun to read and all, but I could say that the other books were more exiting, but it was still good. I think this book was sort of ""clearing things out"" and leaving loose nots for the next two books to tie them up. It didn't give you that sort of feeling that you wont be satisfied until you finish reading it. But the writer cant just come up with a marvelous idea for each book!"
5,Well Worth the Wait,"I have been waiting for approximately three years for the fifth installment of the Harry Potter Series to come out, and boy am I glad I did wait. This book is filled with it all: adventure, drama, suspense, all your favorite characters, and a ton of twists and turns along the way. I will not give anything away, but I loved it--probably better than any other one thus far. Enjoy it."
3,"Order of the Phoenix is ok, but the other books were better","I enjoyed this book --there were many humorous and clever bits in it. However, I think it is a step down from Rowling's previous writing. The main plot line has a few major gaps, and I thought that Harry had quite a whiny, spoiled-brat attitude in the book. I can understand his adolescence, but 38 chapters of it is a bit too much. Read this book for its small parts and try to overlook the unfortunate repetitiveness."
4,It rocked!,"The book was awesome. I loved it. Really.The two reasons I gave the book four stars and not five:1) Snape seemed less mature than the children he was teaching, again!2) It was your typical ""Dumpledore knows all"" we have come to love in the series.BUT, I think I may have read it too fast, and not soaked up enough of the details. The plot was fast, and, wanting so desperately to find out what was going to happen, I found myself skimming ahead or reading the different typefaces sections ahead of time. At one point I had to cover the page next to me, just so I wouldn't cheat.The characters are really developing here. I really loved Luna Lovegood -- it's nice to see someone from a different house is able to hang out with the main characters. I think, however, that Cho has way too many issues. Poor thing."
5,Tremendous young adult fiction,"This book is nearly 900 pages long, but it holds your attention throughout. Few people believe Harry and Dumbledore's assertion tha Lord Voldemort is back. The Ministry of Magic wants to take over Hogwarts and drive out Dumbledore's supporters.But there is a faithful remnant called the Order of the Phoenix who are united in their efforts to keep Voldemort from taking control of the wizard world. Another great volume in the HP series."
4,Harry Potter is Back!,"One thing to say: J.K. Rowling is a great writer. She includes vivid details and all of her stories are put together very well. This book was great, but it was my least favorite in the series. The whole time, Harry was in a bad mood, and yelling at his friends. Nothing exciting happened in the first two hundred pages, and when something did happen, it was sort of forgotten eventually. The book was still in my top ten, and I still have to give J.K. Rowling a ton of credit for writing these wonderful books."
4,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,Dragged a little in comparison to the 1st 4 books but was still excellent.
5,Wow!,"This is by far the best of the Harry Potter books, and one of the best books I have read in a long time. The depth of the characters, the intelligence of the writing and the emotional truth and complexity is extremely engaging.This may not be as enjoyable for younger children, but as a book for adults it is stunningly good."
5,Pure Enjoyment,"This probably isn't the best Harry Potter book, but it is still a great book. I think, Ms. Rowling does a great job portraying Harry Potter as a teenager--some of the struggles, emotions, and dilemmas that some people go thru at that age. I think for some people it might be difficult to read because of this, and also because it's so long, but after reading this I'm having a hard time waiting until the next book comes out! I'm currently re-reading it and so far, I've found that it's even better the second time around."
3,Review of the audio,"I am a huge fan of Harry Potter and of Jim Dale. He acts out these books expertly and has consistantly amazed and enthralled me with his depth and versatility with each character. So why three stars only? That sounds pretty good right? Well, I don't know if Jim Dale is to blame, or if Warner Brothers is the culprit, but you don't change the pronunciation of a MAJOR character's name after already establishing that pronunciation in no less than FOUR previous books. I find the hard ""T"" at the end of Voldemort's name in this book annoying and irritating. I have come to know the characters in these books, not only through my own readings, but through Jim Dale's and I find this change to be cheap and cheesy. I have worked as an editor and proof-reader for years, and one thing stands true above almost any other rule: Consistancy is next to Godliness."
2,Not what i expected,"It is true that J.K.Rowling has captured the loyalty of several fans and that her first four books were a masterpiece in their own. this fifth instalment however has been disappointing and as others say it is more like waffling about the idea of an order of the phoenix. It dosent really satisfy the thirst for knowing more of Voldemorts rebirth and the after math but concentrates on Harry who too has become an insolent freak, im sorry to say. It was nothing but a stack of papers with little interest and no captivating details. in other words it was boring!"
3,Not Quite as Magical,"I've enjoyed each of the Harry Potter books--Rowling has a great formula for the books and writes well--but I'm afraid this installment is not as good as the others. The character are still great, there is good action and it is an entertaining read, but it is just too long and wanders too much. For adult readers, one of the advantages of the Potter series is that the books can be read in one day--they're fun, but you can get a quick fix and move on. This edition, however, is just too much. It doesn't develop quickly enough, it meanders quite a bit in the middle and then everything is summed up too fast. Of course, this book is essential for all Potter lovers, but I hope Rowling gets back on track with her next book."
5,An Absolutely Thrilling Page-Turner,"I read this book in three days, and that was by spacing it out. I looked forward to the release of the book more than my high school graduation, and after reading the book I was not disappointed. I enjoyed every inch of this book. I felt as though there were not as many plot twists as there were in past books, and Rowling relied too heavily on dreams, but other than that I really enjoyed reading this book. My little brother is reading it next and I am egging my parents to read this book. So often I am disappointed by cultural phenomenon, Order of Phoenix is the exception. Everybody should read the Harry Potter series. I anticipate that this series of books will become the next Narnia."
4,"Good, but drawn out","I enjoyed this book. Rowling's a wonderful story teller and I am greatful for these books. However, getting to the end, I couldn't help but wish this was the final book in the series. Like Harry, I was getting tired of it all. I wanted resolution, closure. It's like a slasher movie where the villian gets killed and keeps coming back, again and again and again..."
3,not as good as the last,It was disappointing to see that the 5th installment of the Harry Potter series was twice as long as the others but with only half the action and sense. I was really upset at the change of style and frequent vagueness. I understand that Harry's 15 now and he's supposed to be hurting but it seems a lot more like whining and I just expect more out of a hero.
2,After waiting 3 Years I was dissapointed,"I really enjoyed the first 4 Harry Potter books, but I was very dissapointed in this book. What kept me reading was that I kept thinking that it would get better and I wanted to know who died. I missed so many of my favorite characters that had limited exposure in this story line. I also did not like the way the 15 year old Harry acted most of the time. Hopefully number 6 and 7 will be better."
1,Disappointing!,Disappointing! Disappointing! Disappointing! It seemed JK Rowling ran out of her imagination on Harry Potter series. Nothing exciting so that she had to create unecessary death to cover it up. The excuses for protecting Harry Potter were really ridiculous. I hope JK Rowling will do much better on book six. Otherwise I am afraid nobody will remember Harry Potter at all in 5 years.
2,What a disappointment,"After looking forward to this book for a long time, I was sorely disappointed. The book lacked energy and excitement. The characters were dull, especially Harry who ranted and raved like an out of control two-year-old. It must have been difficult to follow in the footsteps of The Goblet of Fire. Too much Hype."
2,disappointing miss,"Harry Potter 5 was very disappointing--(1) it was very descriptive and repetitive (2) the actual climax does not come till the last 100 pages which were goodOverall the plot was average and Book four really was far superior and had may aspects like the Triwizard tournament, etc3 yrs of wait really dampened itI think perhaps the author may have been distracted owing to the motion pictures being made and perhaps the quality of the book may have sufferedDefinitely not the best"
2,Sadly disappointed,"Previous Harry potter books were entertaining, a joy to read to my children. This one, however, was daunting to say the least, because of the tiresome repetition (repeated, and repeated, and repeated ad nauseum, events we, who have read all the previous books, were already quite familiar with - and those who were not - go buy the books and play catch-up!) of detail, the length ( none of us mind long books- if they are well written) and the non-plot.So disappointing! Felt as though Rowling has lost herself in the Forbidden Forest of Redundency.Might be a good idea if she does start listening to her editors because the book reads as though she's stubbornly written this on her own with very little positive input anywhere!Can only hope there will never be a ""5"" movie- guaranteed to be a 'ho-hummer' at best. Hope that Rowling pulls herself together for her next book.MeE"
3,Harry Potter & the Order of the Phoenix,"Overall a very good book, but I really thought it was not as good as book 3. It was not hard to figure out who was going todie and you kept asking yourself why the charactors were doing the things they were doing when there were alternatives for them to do. Also,it seems that Harry was angry all the time or feeling sorry for himself which does not play well. Also, she builds up the charactor of Neville and then he acts like a bumbling idiot again, why build him up in the first place? She leaves clues in her book that lead to nowhere. Just not as well thought out as I had hoped after all this wait."
3,Not as good as the rest,"The first book had a very engaging begining. This book lacks that. Harry is self centered and misunderstands the actions of those who try to protect him. Even if teenagers are typically seen this way, there is no compelling reason to connect with him emotionally. We do not feel his pain and frustration, we simply see it. The plot is interesting, as always, and there are plenty of curious details to sort out so that the reader (if she is already a Harry Potter fan) will be led along. I do not think the book would be considered well written by a first time reader, however. Also, the ending seems overly designed to make the reader crave the next book. I expected better. Overall, however, it is not bad. JK Rowling should be slightly disappointed with herself."
3,A Little disappointing,"At the risk of bursting anyone's bubbled or angering those who are already in love with #5, I found the book to be rather disappointing. 1/3 of the way into the book I found myself having to push myself to read on. Some of the more endearing traits of the characters are missing and while I recognize Harry is growng up, maybe I'm not ready to deal with ""Holden"" Potter. Also, the plot just seemed less compelling. I think if #5 was the first book in the series, there wouldn't have been lines waiting for books 2-5."
1,saddening,"With this, the fifth book in the series, the quality has taken a nosedive, which rather leads me to suspect that the whole series is going to crash in flames in book 6 + 7. It's a pathetic example of what happens when an author runs out of fuel - no plot, no interesting characters, nothing. The aspects that could have been deeply interesting - such as the relationship between Snape and Harry, and Neville Longbottom's family background, are only mentioned in passing and then apparently forgotten about by the author. I won't bother with the rest of the series..."
5,Brilliant!,Easily the best of the books! Emotions run high as you're taken back to Hogwarts and through more of the Wizarding world. Finally some support for Harry in the forms of grown and powerful wizards! THE TRUTH OF HARRY'S PAST! A WONDERFUL BOOK!
5,great,"the best book of the five. much deeper and darker, and flows better than the last one. This book is amazing."
4,Harry Potter: will book five be the best?,"In my opinion this was an excellent book, but not the best Harry Potter book. It picked up where the others left off, it was very mysterious the entire time and at the end and only the end it made sense, but all the books are like that. So I will say, that one of your favorite characters die. Just to save one of the other characters. This is the ""sad"" part. I almost cried when I read it. It also has action the whole time, with duels and words. There is also everyone's favorite sport. This book was, Sad, romantic, thrilling, adventurous, and much more! So, if you want something to keep you glued to your seat, I say read Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix."
3,You better read this book!,Harry is the main character in the book. He is a boy who goes to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. He keeps having weird dreams of what Voldemort wants him to see and then he had a dream that Sirius was in the Department of Mysteries being tortured by Voldemort who was trying to get Sirius to get the prophecy. Harry thought that Sirius was really there but actually he was safe Voldemort was tricking him to get him to go to the Department of Mysteries. Harry fell for the trick and he went to the Department then Voldemort's Death Eaters caught them. They were almost killed by the Death Eaters when the members of the order come to save them.
2,A major disappointment,"This story could have been told in a tidy 345 pages. Even then, it only would have been mildly interesting compared to the first four novels. It was repetitive and filled with characters and scenes that had no bearing on the plot. And the big revelation at the end of the story was a no-brainer from book one. A major disappointment. I can only hope Rowling and her editors pull it together in Book 6."
3,Fascism hits Hogwarts,"As an adult reading the 5th book in the serious, I was struck by the author's approach to subtly introducing fascism to the young, particularly given the current political climates in the world. This is portrayed with the introduction of Professor Umbrage, who takes over Hogwart's and creates her ""brown troops"" basically from the Slytherin House. This is further developed with Dumbledore, the good and wise headmaster being ejected, and Harry's creation of the ""freedom fighters"" group. What is concerning about her approach, is the expulsion of Umbrage prior to any serious damage having occurred, unlike what normally happens in the real world. Nevertheless, I believe it was quite clever, and an important issue to teach the young and old."
2,"she got bored, perhaps?","weeell...i think she got bored. there was no passion in the writing, so we didn't feel what was happening. we weren't there. however...i loved how snape turned into a person rather than a villain. he treats harry a bit better, more like an equal. ""So...have you been practicing?"" conversational and so on. i loved the chapter ""Occlumency"" because it had my two favorite characters at odds with each other...yet again. snape is at his sarcastic best. ""Are you calling me a coward?"" ""Why, yes, i suppose i am.""but it was weak. the plot was awful. it was more aptly named ""Potter's Pity Party."""
2,BBBBBooorrring,"This book is so boring! It starts off exciting and then gets lossed in words, too many. What I liked about the other Potter books was how they pulled the reader in the magical world. This book has a hard time getting to the point. I skimmed and skipped chapters just to get to the end and it was very so-so. Let's hope book 6 brings back the magic."
5,LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT *sobs*,"I love this book SOOOOOO much. i am a harry potter fanatic and have been waiting for this book for 2 years. I have to say that it is well worth the wait. It has drama, and friendship so strong that not even the evil of voldemort can break it. It's funny and breathtaking. I couldn't put it down! I found myself up all night reading for hours until my eyes couldn't bare it anymore. It kept me on the edge of my seat waiting to see what happened next. this book is the best in the series and it is well worth the wait."
4,"Great Story, Possibly another year would have done it good?","Don't get me wrong, I love the Harry Potter series and I thought book 5 was excellent. It introduces a plethora of wonderful characters and creatures, but at the same time many things were unfinished. Certain pivotal scenes could have been better written, and plot points could be smoothed over still. The book was worth the wait and I liked it better than Goblet of Fire, but my favorite book still remains Prisoner of Azkaban."
5,The Boy Who Lived Lives Up To Expectations!,"As the 5th installment of the Harry Potter, there were many, many of us waiting for this book to arrive. The anticipation alone on this book was something quite extraordinary. I'm happy to say, in my opinion, The Order of the Phoenix lives up to all it's anticipation and hype. I found this book extremely enjoyable, and definitely as good as all the others. I have to say, this book took me quite aback at it's many twists and turns, and every moment was enjoyable. Again, the magic of Harry Potter brings us to life with book, and I'm thouroughly pleased with it's turnout. If you haven't read Harry Potter, now is the perfect time to start. Harry and his friends will keep you hanging for more... I can't wait for the next book!"
4,Pretty Good,"This was a really good book. Although the first 200 pages was a little difficult(interest) this book picked up as soon as Harry got to school. I found there was not enough Voldemort in this book to keep my interest the whole time, although the last 200 pages you can't even put the book down(because of all the action). This is a very different book from all the others in the series, featuring an irritable new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher and the world(finally)against Harry. That made it very new and interesting, the series needed a twist. Although this book was unneccesarily long and far from perfect (they could have cut out lots of parts in this one, at least 300 pages) I would still reccomend this book to anybody."
3,Harry Potter never again,"For some reason, J.K. Rowling has made Hayy into a boy who doesn't have anything to look forward to. He is bitter and self suffering. just like a ny normal person, Harry is supposed to better than that and us common persons.He yells at Dumbeldore and questions his wisdom, I wish someone told harry and J.K.Rowling that the world is bigger than any one of their feelings. I think that J.K Rowlings has taken her past life and a particular vindictive feeling towards to someone who she disliked into the book. sometime the hatred for malfoys and snape and himself is positively nauseating.Please. Harry Potter is everthing fascinating and takes us away from real life. I implore u, Keep it that way. //"
4,"Wonderful seires, but this misses a step","Part of what made the Harry Potter series so amazing was the mystery. There was always an unmasking, clues all around and funny subplots to tide you through. Book four was the height of this concept, with the International Quidditch match and the Triwizard Tournament, it was action packed. Book five however is not. There is no mystery, there is a sub-plot about a series of dreams that really goes nowhere, could have been left out of the book. I raced to the end of the book to find out who dies, and even that was disappointing. I'm not sure if the person is really dead or not and it was definatley not an emotional departure. I was honestly hoping for more."
4,"As usual, I loved it --","I'm a dedicated fan of Harry Potter, so have read all five books. Though this latest doesn't have quite as many inventive twists and turns in the plot as the one previous to it, The Order of the Phoenix still stands up to great storytelling standards and pulled me through those many, many pages so quickly that I can't believe I finished the book by Monday night.(And by the way, a huge thanks to Amazon, who delivered the book into my waiting hands right on time last Saturday.)I can't seem to get enough of this series. So okay then, Ms. Rowling -- no more vacation for you -- get back to work because we're all ready for Book Six now!"
3,not up to J.K. Rowling's usual standard,"This book was a big disappointment for me. It was not up to J.K. Rowling's usual standard. The book was way too long and the plot dragged. It seemed like 800-900 pages of nothing. I also don't understand why J.K. Rowling had to kill a certain character close to Harry. It seemed to add nothing to the plot whatsoever. In J.K. Rowling's defense, perhaps she used this book to throw in little tidbits that will become crucial later on.On the plus side, I enjoyed learning more about Snape and James and Lily Potter in their school days. I also thought Harry's secret Defense Against the Dark Arts classes were fun to read. But these incidents were few and far between.I will keep reading the series although I am less excited about it after this book."
2,Rowling...what happened?!,"Up to the third book of the Harry Potter series was really good but this one...ugh! It was such a pain to read. The only thing that made me finish it was Rowling's great style. Darn, why does the style have to be so good! Harry Potter has gone from a fun magical person to a depressed teenager. What's the deal? Does Rowling think that becuase she's rich, she can stop putting effort into these plot lines?! URGH, it makes me so mad!!! The whole series started out so good. It's really a shame. I don't know. Maybe Rowling's just tired of having to write the same series for so long. I don't blame her for that but she shouldn't have promised seven books, if she wasn't up for it. I don't know. I just wish her luck with he next book! Good luck, J.K. Rowling!"
2,Needs a continuity editor,"In general, it is a very enjoyable book to read, very suspenseful as always - BUT the pleasure of reading it vanished entirely for my part in the 7th to last chapter:Without SPOILING too much, I can say that it was a major letdown that Harry loses his wand and so has no means of defending himself and Hermione - and in the next chapter his wand is back in his hand without no explanation. I was so disappointed!"
2,DISAPPOINTED!!,"Okay, I know JK had to get married, have a baby and write two screenplays while assembling this book. I just wish she didn't try to write the screenplay AS a book!She goes way too deep, forgets what her readers already know (or should know), and takes too many pages to describe key events. For instance, in book one the attack of the troll takes less than four pages. in book five it takes her longer than that to have Harry's broomstick confiscated, and nearly 100 pages to get through the climactic scene which was worth about 50!The plot was good, the story line fine and the characters as good as ever.Too bad the writing was SO POOR"
1,Awful!,"As a huge fan of the Harry Potter series, I can only say, what a a disappointment. I never want to go near this book again. Everything about it is just awful. Its hard to believe Rowling wrote it...."
5,Awesome!,I love Harry potter but the ebook is better! Especially the fact of the changing your own book settings! I loved it!
3,"Great story, but ending is a little weak","I thought the book was well in line with the other stories, which I loved, so no complaints on plot. Although I love long books, I really felt like this was the worst in the series so far.I think JKR's best is when she describes the normal day-to-day events that happen in Harry's life, like Quidditch and pranks and classes gone awry. I think she leaves a little on the table when trying to explain the bigger picture not involving Harry (e.g. what was the Order doing the entire book except meeting here and there?). The story also gets tiring when there are too many people talking as in the end battle at the Ministry and everyone (adults and kids) only knew the same 3 spells. There were some things that I thought were developed slowly and poorly tied off, such as Harry's childish reaction to so many end events when he has been portrayed as a more mature sort in earlier books.Overall, I would still recommend it but I hope the next one is better."
2,Harry Go Home!,"The Harry Potter books are listed on the 100 most frequently challenged book list, published by ALA. Personally, I think that these books should be on the list because the vocabulary is too challenging for little kids under the age of eight. The books and movies are also scary for little kids. J.K. Rowling makes the stories about witches and wizards in a make believe school called Hogwarts. The school is inhabited with ghosts and monsters. In addition, the subject of witchcraft and wizardry is against the moral teachings of many people/families in the United States. Harry Potter must fight off Voldemort throughout the books, and the scenes are violent. Although good wins over evil in all the stories, it is my opinion that the subject matter is too intense for young readers."
1,"Stop the book, I want to get off.","Honestly, I've read fanfiction that made more sense and was more enjoyable than this. That is a dissapointment."
1,Another Pathetic Attempt,"Another one?! These books are just plain poorly written. I do not understand why these Harry Potter books are so popular. The charactures are boring and dull, the attempts at humor were pathetic, and these books are plain boring. These are just another fantasy series where its been there done that if you know what I mean. If not, then I will explain: modern fantasy is all going down hill, sort of. There are some good writers out there that are excellent. However, Harry Potter are those books that are going downhill. The writing is very poor and the dialogue is very hard to follow. I also did not feel as though I was there: another mark of poor writing skills. Overall, I give this book one star."
2,Corny,This is the wors of the arthours book. The first and the second and the third was better than this.... First off there was so much things going on making the book long and complicated. Don't get me wrong I like long books and stuff but this book was so I don;t know Not what I expected.You waited for this book for such a long time and this is what you get.
1,"Yeah, so what?","The new Harry Potter book is finally out, and in this one he gets to battle more evil goblins in his little broom and save England from a curse or spell or something. Big whoop. What, may I ask, is the big deal about Harry Potter? He was even named as one of VH1's top 200 Pop Culture Icons. Why?!? People, really. All he does is fly around, practice witchcraft, and ""save the day"". Come on. This has been done before, believe it or not. This is nothing original.Hey, if all you need to do to make a million dollars is write books like this, than sign me up!Oh, and go ahead and click ""Not Helpful"". I don't care what you think."
2,A good tale but needs editing,"I was eager to read the fifth book, but I think its overly long, and needs editing. It moves slowly, too much non moving sideplots. 125 pages in and very little is known more than Voldemort has returned.Harry is whiny and cranky, all the characters seem to be bored with life. I understand that this is considered to be a return to the style of the first book, but, in my opinion, it could be great, but it needs to be edited severely."
3,good but not the best,"I liked this book, but compared to her previous four, it was much too serious. I felt like the whole time it was instructions for the movie. Although I am happy to see Ginny get a personality, and it would be a lie if I said I'm not going to read it again."
4,"Good, but different","Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, a book to quench the thirst of any Harry Potter fan, is an excellently plotted book, but the writing was different. J.K. Rowling's style of writing seems to have changed greatly when compared with Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, not in its paragraph length, but in its preciseness. Before she would have said ""He left to get the drinks, paying for them himself. When he tasted it, it warmed him to his fingertips."" If she had written that now, she would probably describe how he walked away, paid, walked back, and given the drinks. The plot elements were interwoven in a traditional way, but the writing needed to be shortened. Though very good, it needed some work."
5,it deserves 8 stars but i can't give it that many,best book ever written. Nothing compares to harry potter for books just like nothing is as good as star wars or Pirates of the caribbean for movies
4,Not As Good As The Other 4,"After waiting something like 3 years for the 5th book to be released, I expected the best one yet. But 'The Goblet Of Fire was a million times better. This is still a four star book, but it is more boring, less exciting, and the dragon duels are pointless and silly. Although a lot of it is intriguing, I find the fact that Harry is bitter all the time very disturbing. This IS a good book, but it is something of a letdown compared to the others."
2,Lacking Luster & Excitement,"Well, after highly anticipating the arrival of this book and finishing it from cover to cover, I must say that I was greatly disappointed.The book did not give me the overall thrills compared to the previous volumes. There was not enough action and when I heard that one of the main characters was going to die, it was not what I expected.Now I am hesitant about reading the next 2 volumes, wondering if they will lack luster. Hopefully the series will not end that way."
2,Not one of her best,"After book three and four, this installment was a big dissapointment. It could have been easily edited by about 200 or 300 pages, and the expected plot twists and turns developing the mystery never really gels. The ending is anti-climactic. Furthermore, some of the characters become more and more flat and unlikeable; Harry turning into the angry, unreasonable teenager, and Cho the hysterical emotionaly-needy chick.That said, I am a huge fan of Harry Potter, so I think any fan will find any part of the series engaging. Just don't expect too much this time."
3,Three stars is still a good rating,"Don't get me wrong, I still enjoy this book, it's just my least favorite of the series. The first half was as good as ever, funny and witty, with a great plot. But the ending part is what ruined it for me, with it's humor feeling out of place in the seriousness of it. I still recommend it because it really is a good book, it's just my least favorite of the series."
3,Harry's a moody teenager,"I agree pretty much with the reviewer alpha3760 who wants to put Harry on Prozac. Perhaps JK Rowling wanted to make him a moody angst-ridden unpleasant self-absorbed teenage boy - whatever, she did for me. He's grown into a most unlikeable character: moody, rude and self-absorbed. I gave the book 3 stars because of the continuing imaginative tour de force that is the HP series. I'd like to see what happens next, but there was a lot about this book I did not enjoy, including the length - about 300 pages too long. The action took way too long to develop, and when it did it was a silly confused mess. The Umbridge character was so irritating as to make me almost want to put the book down. Lord Voldemort is looking like a sulky wimp, and as for the Death Eaters ... !! But isn't it great that a 50+ year old is arguing this way about a ""kid's"" book?"
3,I just hope Rowling hasn't peaked by Book 4,"I must say book 5 was a bit disappointing. Maybe book 4 was just too good. The whole plot in BK 5 is based on some very silly premises that I think is anti-climatic, and the person who died, just died because Rowling wanted to write more about death or how a teenager must deal with death.Granted, I still like this book, it talks about many other things in the wizard's world: giants, hosipitals, bars, it gives us a better picture of Harry's world.Let's say everything was interesting but the main plot line.I just hope 6 and 7 will be better."
2,Dark and dreary Harry Potter,"If I wanted teen age angst and pain I would read Hesse or Updike. This book is really a letdown after re-reading the first 4 books, and I hope this isn't a sign of things to come."
4,Good but there are better ones,"First off, start at the beginning of the series if you're going to read it. That is when the majority of things are explained. This is a decent book in the series but I think Goblet Of Fire was a tad bit better. I have noticed that Harry changes alot starting in the fourth book and the books are getting darker. In this book Harry has a new enemy, loses a friend and starts getting very angry. I think that Half-Blood-Prince, this, and Goblet of fire are the top three because they show how everything is getting darker in the wizarding world and the plots are better. Read the books because they are good and not because trillions of kids are obsessed."
5,Not just for non-readers,"I'm an avid reader and have read all the Harry Potter books, some more than once. But I find listening to Jim Dale read the books lends new depth and meaning to the stories. Of course, if you can't take time to read the books, listening to them is a great alternative. But even if you have read the books multiple times, try listening to Jim Dale read one of them. My guess is you'll hear things you never noticed before."
3,Not what it should be.,The fact of the matter is that JK Rowling can write whatever she wants and the muddled masses are all going to buy it and love. But quite simply this book is not half as good as the other four. Now I have heard some people (mostly English majors) that this is the best of the series just for the character development. Well maybe but there is more to writing then denouement and enveloping structure (not that this book has either. this book just isn't as fun as the others. It doesn't read like a kid's book. Yes many adultgs read it but I think that is mostly because we like feally like kids again which is what the first four books did. Plus lets not make the mistake of thinking that adults are really much more intellectual than children. THis book wasn't bad it was just a little slow. Of course I am one of the masses so I will read the next one but I just hope it will be better than this one.
5,Yeah for Harry Potter!,I am in my seventies and am an avid reader. The 4000+ pages of the entire Harry Potter saga have been one of the literary delights of my life. Worthwhile sentiments..... heroics.... failures..... confusions ....friendship...... WHAT'S NOT TO LIKE ???!!!
4,"Dark, but very good","My son says this is the best of the series...until now. He is reading the 7th book. He also says this book has more magic and excitement than the previous ones and it is a great fantasy book. It is darker than the other books, which might not be suitable for young children. Our advice is to read the books in order."
4,When's Book 6 coming out?,"Having received The Order of the Phoenix on Sunday, I rushed and read it just about cover to cover. I have to say, that for the most part, Rowling continues the tradition she has laid out over the first four books. Her portrayal of Harry as a teenager is dead on. Anyone who ever was or knows a teen would agree. Importantly, this book answers many of the questions that were on the minds of Potter fans while opening us up to new ones. My one criticism of this current installment is the straight forward nature of the story being told. For the first time, Rowling failed to add a twist towards the end of the book, making the climactic scene while very enjoyable, somewhat predictable. However, I still find myself sitting here wondering when is book 6 coming out?"
5,Rowling really outdoes herself,"When I had first heard of the Harry Potter series some time ago, I never would have guessed how extremely well crafted this tale of spells and sorcery really was. The same holds true for the 5th book in the series. Coming from someone who is also a Tolkien, and Lovecraft fan, I expect a certain level of genuine emotional value interpreted through the words of the author. I actually found myself loathing Umbridge's trials of Haryy, and being zig-zagged around as to who could potentially bite the dust. J.K. Rowling uses her wordcraft to effectively manipulate your emotions and drag them all over the place. I really could go on aggrandizing this book, but I'll just save it and let you read it for yourself."
2,A let-down,"Like everyone else, I eagerly awaited this book. Big disappointment. It sorely needs editing, perhaps as many as 400 pages could go. I never felt like I couldn't put it down. I read the first four books twice apiece, but I won't bother with this one. The big action scene at the end dragged on forever. The first books had lots of new, charming, and exciting characters and events and spells. This book was just the same stuff and the plot was completely predictable. Well, I'll still read the next one. I'm sure it will be better."
4,Catcher-in-the-rye-meets potter.,"If book had been shorter, I would have giving it 5 stars. About 400 or so pages are used to explore, feelings andhidden corners, but they're nessasary,to answer questions raised by the previous 4 books. The Harry Potter series, does a much better job of exploring what teens go through, male and female. Than ""Catcher in the rye"" or Mark Twain"
5,Read This,"It's obvious that if you are a fan of harry potter, you should read this. But if you arent a fan, i recommend you read the 1, 2, 3, then 4th book, then this. I never thought books could be so exciting, it's really like and adventure(the harry potter books.)"
5,Harry Potter & the Order of the Phoenix: Great buy!,"I really enjoyed the fourth sequel to the first Harry Potter book. It shed a new light on the story as a whole, further engaging the reader in a love for Harry and all the other characters, except, of course, You-Know-Who and his evil followers.This book took on a slightly different mood from the other Harry Potter books, as I soon found; Harry feels that the whole wizardry thing is less of a novelty sort of thing, but J.K. Rowling still manages to make the story the best in the series yet.However, I would like to warn some that Harry is getting older, and therefore the story becomes a bit more mature, with a bit more strong language, but the book is still a classic.As further proof of the book's greatness, I would like to share that the reading time for each book keeps getting shorter! The Prisoner of Azkaban took me three days to read, this one took me just a bit over a day! It's a really great buy; definitely worth it. Happy reading!"
5,"""ON THE EDGE EDGE OF YOUR SEAT""","I HAVE NEVER READ QUITE THIS GOOD A BOOK WITHIN THIS GENRE, NOTHING LIKE IT FROM ""THE LORD OF THE RINGS"" TO THE 3RD ""HARRY."" THIS AMAZING BOOK (WHICH I FINISHED READING IN ONLY 3 DAYS) PRESENTS THE MOST SPECTACULAR STORY OF THE NOW-15-YEAR-OLD WIZARD. THERE HAS NEVER BEEN QUITE THIS THRILLING AN ""ON THE EDGE EDGE OF YOUR SEAT"" KIND OF BOOK. I WAS EXCITED, SCARED, SAD, AND HAPPY (BUT DEFINITELY NEVER DISAPPOINTED -- AND DEFINITELY WORTH THE WAIT). I WAS PARTICULARLY STRUCK BY HOW HARRY AND CHO BECOME MUCH CLOSER IN ONE WAY, YET PART FURTHER IN ANOTHER. IF I HAD THE OPTION OF EXCEEDING THE FIVE-STAR GRADING RANGE, I WOULD MARK THIS 7*!"
3,Not bad...,"Not bad, I read it with my son, and we both found it to be a good read. I thought about giving the ending away, but he talked me out of it... ;)"
2,More of the same,"It is completely mind boggling that every time it is the same story she tells in a different cover. Just read the first in the series and then go on to read something else, completely non Potter related."
4,WHY?!!,"The reason I took away a star is, even though I loved the book, the ending had me so depressed! I mean how DARE J.K. Rowling kill off... well how dare she kill off my fav. supporting charactor. There was no reason for it! I was crying so hard during the last few chapters that I couldn't even read it anymore. All I have to say is that somehow, he better still be alive. But even if he is we probably won't find out for like five years.So all in all, it started great but ended horribly....sigh anyway I'm 13. (and I'm VERY depressed)"
3,not as good as book 3 or 4,"its good, a little too drawn out at some parts, there was too much hype surrounding it, i was expecting more adventure rather then just 670 pages of events leading up to about 200 pages of adventure at the end. harry's character growth is so amazing."
4,"A good read, but definitely dark","Having just read through my copy of OOTP, I have to say it was very interesting to see some of the plot twists. I laughed out loud more than once. But I will have to wait a little while before I read it again to get over my disappointment at the character's death. I only hope it has a greater meaning in a later book."
4,OK,"I finished this book last night with mixed feelings. I like the plot and the last few chapters are really engaging. However, Harry's immaturity (perhaps intended) in this book gets on my nerves at times. Some little details are also behind (OWL results for instance). Nevertheless, a good read, a worthy sequel of Harry Potter."
2,Irresponsible,"This is a dark book in which Harry's lifetime of problems come full circle. He's angry, and refuses to listen to what anyone tells him to. Harry's blant disregard for authority gets someone killed. And once again Dumbledor knows all but refuses to tell anything until the end of the book. I would not recommend this book to anyone under the age of 15."
3,"Not bad, could be better","I like to read practically everything, so naturally, when the fifth book came out, I rushed to buy it (just in time for a nice, long camp read). I expected so much, but got so little in return (Except a large headache, and a vague knowledge of what Voldemort was after) The ending hurried things up, leaving me confused as to what Dumbledore explained, and how it was relevant. We had already known most of it anyway. While I do agree with some that this isn't the best of the series, I certainly don't think it should be banned. After all, they all celebrate Christmas. In fact, if any religions should be upset, it should be the Jews, Muslims, Hindus, Buddhists, etc. There are no minorities in the book. So why is everyone saying it's evil? Sorry about my tangent. Overall, not bad, but instead of spending twenty bucks, take it out of the library."
1,Disappointing at best,I was very disappointed with this book. I am a huge Harry Potter fan and was among those in line ahead of time to get this book. I got it the first day and finally finished it last night. All of the other books were finished within 2 days. It just did not have the excitement and energy of the other books. It was far to descriptive of the little details and lost alot of the excitement because of it. It dwelled to much on the dark stuff and really never came together for me. To many references to history and not enough new stuff. The final battle was uninspiring and the book could have been cut in about half and still ended up with the same impact. Umbridge was just to mean. I hope the next book is better.....
3,"Rowling: Have you been ""inspired"" ?","I Think Rowling should acknowledge the following:That the relationship between Voldemort and Potter is a direct lift from the Indian story of Lord Krishna whose maternal uncle wanted to kill him based on a prophecy.She has in fact, wrote this book, combining Enid Blyton with the Lord Krishna's story.That Cornelius Fudge is a caricature of the German Writer Cornelia Funk who addresses the same genre as Rowling's."
1,weak,"The highly anticipated book was a let down. The plot made no sense and dragged on and on. even for a world of magical things, the key points were highly unbelieveable. Major dissapointment."
1,Not what I expected,"I was very disappointed with this book. Sure, it was good writing and very thrilling, but Harry was not a very nice child in this book. He was disobedient, got away with all his wrong doings and rule breaking and was rude and ""cheeky"" to his elders. I found that this book had a lot of violence in it: i.e. when he had to write lines and the words were carved into his hands and bleeding and swelling up. I think that this book teaches other kids that it is okay to disobey those in authority and to back-talk your elders. The use of bad language and language that in England is unknown to Americans, but is actual cursing.... very bad cursing, was totally inappropriate and unnecessary. I would not recommend this book to anyone as I found it quite horrid in parts. I am done with this series......"
2,Lost the Magic,"I am a great fan of the Harry Potter series and feel that the author is gifted, however, this book was disappointing. It was so slow getting started that I almost stopped reading it several times. The plot seemed to lack originality and purpose. I was expecting someone really important to die like Hermione, Ron, Hagrid or Dumbledore but it was just Sirius. I was not very impressed with Dumbledores confession to Harry. The book was too long and I remained bored throughout."
3,Twice as long as it should be,"It got hard to follow. It was as if Rowling was up against a deadline and couldn't figure out what to cut. (It's not like she was paid by the word.) Yes, the saga makes another step forward, and ties a few things together, but it seems like that's all it does."
5,The Best Book Ever! I can't wait until Book 6 comes out!,"This is my favorite book of all time so far. But that is not why I am typing this review: I am 12 years old and am writing a Fantasy novel myself, which will be published this Spring of 2005. I am desiring to sell my book to a company that will then produce copies to spread nationwide. I am not allowed to reveal my name yet, but I can tell you that adults have read almost all of my story and believe it is outstanding and hard to set down! Whoever will want a copy, look at your bookstore this Spring. I am hoping that you will enjoy it. The title I have picked out right now is ""The Secrets of Serm: Book One The Nazelian Legend""...."
1,Unbelievable Dissapointment,"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is perhaps one of the biggest let downs ever. This book was horrible all around. The addition of the Umbridge character was the biggest mistake ever. She took all excitement out of the book and made it so long and drawn out, I could barely stand to finish it. If i was just an average fan, I never wouldve finished the book it is so bad. There are only 2 chapters where some form of excitement happens, ... The book is horribly predictable and long. Everytime you think it may get better, it doesn't. It gets worse.The fourth book was so great, but this book just is an embarassment. I only recommend this book so that you know what is happening during the sixth book. This book was a big let down folks, if you don't see this, then you're incredibly naive, or just stupid."
2,Harry has a dull year,"This book is a perfect example of what happens when the author perceives herself to be greater than the editor. Clearly the weakest book of the lot. 500 pages into the book and absolutely nothing has happened. My family and I struggled through this endless tome. How disappointing was the silly ending? And the entire book could have been ended on page 10 if only someone told Harry what was going on. Everyone in the world knew except Harry. They should have named this one ""A Chronology of Harry's Boring Fifth Year, Except for a Few Hours of Excitement Near the End""The money JK knew she was going to make on this book required that it be masterful. It wasn't and she took an extra year because she knew it wasn't. This was a two-star book but it really should be a zero star book because of what it could have been."
5,This is the fifth book in JK's great series,"If you or your child has not read this series, what are you waiting for? This book gets darker in a series that is meant to thrill and excite! Read the series in order to get the full impact of the series. This book has Harry and company learning more about Lord ""V""s control before Harry was born. We meet Luna Lovegood and Hogwarts has a new teacher who is assigned by the minstry of magic. The ministry does not want the students of Hogwarts trained combat. Harry is convinced that he must teach his friends and other students what he had learned about defense of the dark arts.A major person dies in this book and Harry finds out a secret about his future battle with the dark Lord. A good read."
3,"too depressing, but I still love the gang..","I am a grown-up reader who can't get enough of the lot at Hogwarts. I have been waiting a very long time for this book to be published. I finished it in 3 days and was not pleased(even read it a second time, incase I missed something important). I think there was way too many bad things happening all the time. I was so desperate to hang on to any happy moment, but that was lost almost as soon as it started with some tragic happening. I still love this story and hope that in the 6th year, Harry finally bumps off He-who-must-not-be-named and the students can have some happy Hogwarts moments."
1,not impressed,"I bought this to complete my daughter's set, she loves the books but doesn't have this one, the others are from her grandmother and were first editions, with slip covers. This binding is done in a new way, it didn't look very good, smller size compared to the other hardbound volumes. I returned it and searched for a first American edition, to match what she has ."
5,Truly great book,"This book is really great. At first it starts a little boring but at is goes on it gets exiting. As you read the book, J.K Rowling does not give much information of what is what and you keep asking yourself a lot of questions. It is until the end that it gets really exiting. Harry starts going out with Cho, Harry and his friends make up a club for only some people,there is a really mean, stupid new teacher and someone that Harry loves dies. At the end most of your questions are answered but it makes you anxious to want the next book."
5,Well Worth The Wait,"When I found out for the second time that book 5 had been delayed, I decided I would not be buying it when it came out...All this is to say that I didn't sleep last night on account of me reading the entire book in one sitting.The book is much better written than any of the previous books, and the character developement, revealed story aspects, and unexpected twists and turns make this an absolute must buy if you have read the previous 4.The book completely blew me away, more than once actually, during my reading, and I have no doubt that it will do that same thing for you.After this book though, I must warn you, you shall likely be very upset that book 6 doesn't even have a release date."
4,Growing up adds new burdens,"I've been waiting for the book to come out for two years, and as soon as I got the book, I started reading and didn't put it down until I was done. Harry has been forced to grow up fast by the events in his life, yet he continues to be treated as a child by people around him. I loved the book, but my heart broke with every new challenge Harry and the gang faced. The tone of the novel is older and darker, there is a sense of the lost of pure innocence. Although that saddens me, I think Rowling did a wonderful job in writing Harry as a teenager no longer seeing the world with rose-colored lens. He has become jaded but he has not lost his principles or ideals. I would highly recommend this book to anyone over twelve."
2,Worst so far,"This was by far the worst book in the series so far. Rowling went to extremes to obliterate all connection one fomerly felt for her three main charachters. (Harry, Hermione, and Ron)Unlike her previous works in the series she seemed to be forcing in information to be expounded upon later rather then writing from the heart and discovering the tidbits later. I felt throughout most of the book that I was waiting for something important and exciting to come but reached the end of the book before it arrived. Maybe what I was hopeing for might arrive at the begining of the next book? Unfortunately the next will probably manage to be even longer. Well heres to hoping the next book recieves more effort and less TIME.If you want something worth while reading, read The Lord of the Rings. It is only a little bit longer, but has much more depth."
1,Feel let down!,"This book was really bad. I am 10 years old and a great Harry Potter fan. This book was disappointing because it was not up to the standard of JK Rowling's other books. For one, it was too long and had a lacklustre beginning. And then, there was a lot of repetition of plots and ideas. I plan to write my thoughts to JK Rowling because it was so bad and felt extremely let down."
5,I loved it!!,"Just want to say that this book was wonderful!! Although it was certainly darker than the last 4, it was EXACTLY what it needed to be. Harry is getting older and things are moving faster...I can't believe there are only 2 more left! Thank you JK Rowling for staying true to form, and true to Harry!! I look forward to the rest of this amazing story!!"
2,Good because it was Harry Potter. Not for it's content.,"870 pages is a heck of a big book. However after the first 300 pages nothing much has happened and what has happened is rather poorly described. The plot slowly gets going and only after 800 pages does it really hit full stride. Then it finishes 10 pages after the final scene with you wishing that there was more. Not because the book was so interesting, but because the book didn't really say or do much.The main reason it was enjoyable was because the kids are still as mischevous as ever. Of the five books it is the least enjoyable of the five. Considering the hype and amount of time this book had taken I was quite diappointed.I reccomend this to someone who was read all the Potter books, for if this is the first Potter book a person reads they might not read any of the others.Read it because it is Harry Potter. Not because it is a good book."
5,Great book for ANY age,"I must say my first experience with the Harry Potter world did not occur until I saw the first movie in the theatre (relutantly dragged by my mother and nephews). I was hooked from that time on. I left the theatre and went and purchased the books. This fifth book is truly amazing. I am not sure how JK Rowling was able to create in such depth the Harry Potter world, but it is spectacular. I would recommend this book for ANY age person. I have already read the series twice and am looking forward to reading it again soon."
5,Jump on the Hogwarts Express!,"Fans of the series should not be disapointed with the fifth book. Rowling has done it again, making it more compelling, adventurous and again taking us over as you dive into the 860 page book. It's Harry's fifth year, and it certainly is an interesting one. With a new DADA teacher, dealing with crushes and love, the evil that is You-Know-Who, friends, Quidditch, and loss, you won't want to put the book down. Plenty of surprises are in store, and even when you finish, you'll be yearning for the 6th book. The character that dies may or may not be who you expect, but has a greater impact than you might realize. Things are cleared up and things become more confusing, with revelations in store. Like I said, this book lives up to its name and Harry Potter has returned again taking over the hearts of his fans and record sales."
3,Down the hill,"Book is quite disappointing. I was actually skipping pages. First 4 books were very light, emotional, you felt as you were in Hogwarts, Privet Drive... This one is very heavy written, much darker, it just lost the charm of Harry Potter. I really hope that next 2 books will be on the top again."
3,Disappointed,"Although I like J.K. Rowling's style and I usually like all of the Harry Potter books, I was disappointed with this book because Harry had no fun. It had no good things as he had to deal with no Quiddich, Umbridge, and Voldemort. I thought this might happen in the 7th book, but not this one."
2,Amazing,"I am completely amazed at how BAD a book can be. If I had a dollar for all of the reason that I like this book, then I would not even have enough to buy a Pack Of Gum. I've read the other four and they are amazing. This one(#5) makes me feel like I was completely ripped off. Rowling obviously spent no time writting a book that would make him millions of dollars on the name alone.Amazingly Bad"
1,Stop reading!,"The Harry Potter Series is getting worse and worse! You could notice it in the 4th book and it was obvious in the 5th. The author is either writing only for money now,or she's becoming a worse author. I'm not even going to bother reading the 6th one. The book was like a soap opera. Everything was overdramatic. The ending was most dissapointing. I wont bore you with deatails. Two thumbs down."
1,DEFINITELY NOT FOR KIDS,"While I like all the books so far (1-5), the last two installments are just too dark and scary and gory for kids. They discuss instant death curse and pain-inflicting curses in detail, and all the killings are just too scary even for older kids. Furthermore, the parts about the tortures are just disgusting. I bet younger kids will have nightmare if they read those parts. The part on Harry secretly teaching other students about defense against dark arts doesn't help either. I don't recommend these two books (4&5) for kids."
3,Harry Potter and the Half -blood Prince,"I decided that if I was going to criticize the Potter books I should actually read them. Having read all 6 books in the series I can say that J.K. Rowling is nowhere near the quality writer that J.R.R. Tolkein and C.S. Lewis were. Second, I would never recommend these books to young readers because of the violence that gets increasingly worse in each succeeding book. The books characters, i.e. witches, wizzards, etc. use ""good"" magic and ""bad"" magic. There is no such thing as ""good"" magic. These books stir up an unhealthy interest in the occult and the blackness that accompanies it. Harry Potter and his friends also take great delight in the misfortunes of others and many times contrive to cause these misfortunes to occur to those they dislike. I would not recommend it for children. The books are mildly interesting, causing the reader to want to know what happens next, but the story drags on in many places which tends to cause boredom with the story."
1,Yawn attack on a one way street,"Seriously How can anyone stand this stupid book or any of them after the first. Once the first came out it was clear that Harry Potter was really popular and wouldn't stop for a while so a second book was written assuming the popularity of Harry Potter they would keep on writting books and having it turn out happy-ended. (Yawns again) it's the same plot over and over: Oh no! Something bad is happening at hog-warts. Zap, Zap, oops, aha, uh-oh, yeah we win! Same sequence over and over fits in halloween catagory and because of it's popularity people will keep giving the publishers money when the plot's all the same and the movies are just a good way to get away with being lazy."
3,a good book?,"Of course it was a good book, unfortunetly it was not even close to being as good as books three and four, the book got a lot longer, however the main storyline failed to move along, there were many side plots, but nothing really happened in the main story only one or two things developed. It was a bit dissapointing."
2,Wonderful Sleep Draught!! Tedious and Uninspired,"A waste of time and money. Rowling must have thought she was writing a Tolstoy novel instead of a ""can't put it down"" thriller as in the first 4 books. Hopefully this will be rectified in the next volume.Although Harry's behavior is like that of a teenager,the book lacked cohesiveness and anything totally captivating.I am disappointed after all the hype and also after the quality of the previous books."
4,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,"Rowling did a great job setting the tone for this book in the first chapter. She revisted several past threads, and threw in some tantalizing items to speculate on. When staid and shrill Aunt Petunia blurted out that dementors were the guards at the wizard prison of Azkeban, I was nearly knocked off my chair. The goings on at Hogwarts were equally interesting. I especially liked the potrayal of the new Defense of Dark Arts teacher, a poisonous queen bee if there has ever been one. Harry's expanding relationship with other Hogwarts students, and their formation of Dumbledore's Army, set up some promising prospects for the future. I was a bit disappointed at the end of the book, however. The secret being closely kept from both Harry and Voldemart seemed a bit of an anticlimax to me. I still enjoyed the book greatly. Any book that can keep both me and my 17 year old son home reading all weekend is quite rare, and precious indeed."
4,"dark, mature","Though not the best in the series,(I vote Goblet Of Fire the best) I was hooked right from page one. And I came in for a few surprises and shocks. Harry is not the same old Harry. He has become a moody teenager full of self-doubt.Lots of new characters have been introduced. Tonks (whom I loved), Umbridge(repulsive as a toad), Luna Lovegood(intriguing). You meet some characters from earlier series, Lupin, Mad Eye Moody...As a whole it was a bit depressing ..., with Harry going through a bad time, but very engrossing. And the Weasley twins are up to their usual tricks which make you chuckle out loud. Lots of things have been left unsaid, unexplained for the next series.Great work, JKR."
3,A Good Installment,"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix was a good installment of the Harry Potter series. Needless to say, it is impressive in length and the story is dark, comical, and mysterious. It brings into light the power of good and evil against each other. This installment directly shows us how Harry is maturing into a more powerful and important character in relation to others. Order of the Phoenix is my third-to-last least favorite of the series.Zachary B. MedinaAuthor of Decador"
1,Poor Quality,"I love Harry Potter and wanted a replacement for my battered second hand hardback copy of ""Order of the Phoenix"". I was really disappointed in the quality of this book and no jacket cover. It's much smaller than the one I own. This book has a hard cover but the quality of paper is equal to that of a paper back book. So if you want a quality hard back Harry Potter book, this isn't it. If you just want the book to read but not save, then save yourself some money and order a paperback copy."
5,The best book so far...,"In the fifth installment of ""Harry Potter"", Rowling again bested her previous book. The Order of the Phoenix is a gorgeous novel, I just LOVED it!"
4,Read Me! Read me! Im Lyndsay`s!,"Harry and Dudley get attacked by demintors. He gets picked up and taken to the Order of the Phoenix. Surus tells Harry some information about Lord V. They went to Hogwarts and Harry started this group called the D.A. They started it because the dont like thier new Defence aginst the Dark Arts teacher, Professor Umbrage. Mr. Wesley was attacked by a snake. Ten people excape from Askabam. Hagrid is on probation. Harry want on o date with Cho Chang and it was really bad. He met with Hemonie and Lunna. Harry studied occlumency with Snape. Professor Trewlony gets sacked. Fred and Goerge set off some fireworks. Harry gets in to Snapes memories. They meet Hagrid's brother Grawp. Hagrid gets sacked. Harry has a dream about Lord V. hurting Sirius Black. They ride on Thestrals to the ministery of Magis.Its a good book and i think you should read it!!!"
4,"Fun, Capturing, and Highly Imaginative","While Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is a hugely enthralling book, full of interesting plot twists, off-beat characters, and a very vivid background, this book is not without its problems.I find the weakest aspect of this book is Rowling's repeated use of devices such as dreams/visions to advance the plot, coupled with the last two chapters being dedicated to Dumbledore's explanation (similarily to three of the four previous Harry Potter Novels) instead of a more linear plot throughout the novel.The second problem I found were some of the unpalatable characters. Professor Umbridge was very flat, portrayed as a power-hungry, inept wizard, while Cornelius Fudge was shown to be an uncharismatic, paranoid fool, despite his election into office and years of service.Despite these problems, Rowling has written a truly amazing work. Empathy is impossible not to feel for the protagonists, the plot is gripping, and Harry continues to amaze us all."
4,Dark and sad,"This book is much darker then the rest of the series: Hogwarts is under a fascist regime from the Ministry of Magic, Dumbledore seems to give Harry the cold shoulder, and Harry's connection to Lord Voldemort is growing stronger.After the events in the climax, the resolution does not bring the energy into an up swing. This is not a happily ever after finish.It is the use of dark images and feelings that make us realize how evil Lord Voldemort really is. Excellently written. If a child is reading the book, it should be discussed with him or her when finished."
2,less would have been more,"I like the Harry Potter books and have read all 5 so far. This is my least favorite. It is too long and doesn't really have the oomph that the other books had. I imagine Rowling would not let her editor trim the book down and thus it suffers.The quality of the writing itself could use some improvement, too. Phrases are used too often. For example, everyone ""turns on his/her heel"" and Harry sees Cho and and his stomach ""feels like he skipped a step going down stairs"" more than once.I also was irritated that Rowling kept building up aspects of the plot and ""dangling"" them in front of you, but not giving it to you until the end. Then when we finally get it, it is fairly anti-climatic. This book doesn't really teach you anything new about the characters, it is mostly just there. The new things we do learn could easily fit into a book 1/10th the size of this one and not leave anything out.To sum up, the other HP books are good, this one was OK, but mostly a let-down."
3,DOES HOGWARTS HAVE A DCFS?,"I have to say I am a little disapointed in the book. Hasn't Harry done some incredible things in the other books? Great at Quidditch, Retrieved the Socerers Stone, Won the Triizard championship, etc..... Why is it that no one believes he is the good guy yet? Why is everyone so mean to him? This kid has been through ... . Parents killed. Abusive step-partents. Has he ever been hugged and cuddled by a loving person? No wonder the kid is grumpy through out the book. Does Hogwarts have counselors? Why is everyone always so stern? No one investigates the detention time with Umbridge? It sounds like he was at Maryville Academy in the Chicago area. What kid could survive what Harry has so far and not ended up a criminal or worse? It was the love of Harry's parents that saved him from Voldemort but I don't see any real love at Hogwarts. DCFS need to investigate! I am putting Hogwarts on notice! Get a social worker! Give Harry a hug!"
4,The Door at the End of the Silent Corridor,"OOOOuuuucccchhhh!!! Harry's scar is prickiling. ""It's the most its done at one time."" This awesome book will have you well reading into the night. The Aurors are as busy as ever in the ministy. Just keep reading to see what happends next.With Voldemort back, the Order of the Phoenix is recalled. The Ministry is under stressful times, as well as Dumbledore. Harry must gaurd something that Voldemort is after. If he gets hs slimey hands on it, the fate of the ministy has risen. His dream has came true about opening the dorr at the end of a corridor.This book will have you flipping pages on and on from morning to night. Remember to eat your meals because you will forget while you are reading this book.This book has the good guys showing their victory over Lord Voldemort and his growing rebellion."
5,EXTRA EXTRA READ ALL ABOUT IT CHUNGHA MONKEY,"AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!J.K. Rowling's fifth novel of the Harry Potter series is incredible!! It all starts out with Harry Potter. Dementors attack him. They are black hooded figures that suck your soul right out of you. This book takes place in Hogwarts, a magical school of witchcraft and wizardry. Hogwarts has moving staircases, insane ghosts, scary teachers, and any other crazy thing you can think of. Harry a famous wizard, Ron keeper of the Quitich team, Hermione, an intellectual, but kind witch and lord Voldermort I mean he who must not be named are the main characters. This year Harry has to face dastardly, and incredulous villans, suspension from the quitich team, dodging bludgers, and blood curdling detentions. Harry also has to save the Order of the Phoenix. Harry also has to save the prophecy. If the prophecy falls into the wrong hands then Lord Voldermort is back!!!!!!!!!! A mystery awaits, dare to read?A must to read book!!"
4,Not as best as the others,"The Order of the Phoenix, to me, was quite depressing. Usually when I have read a Harry Potter book, I feel more anxious, adventurous, and happy at the end. However, in this book, nothing seemed to go right whatsoever on the happy part. However, at the end of the book is when the battle really gave a turn in the book, that only a real genius of imagination could come up with.The book was excellent overall, but a few things were hard to understand. (Ex. harry's scar). I cannot wait till the next book comes out. Hopefully it will bring a more positive feeling."
3,#5,"I am a little disappointed...I was hoping that Harry would find someone he can truly connect with..and it just did not happen...instead he has another person close to him die. I think the only thing I like is the stories behind the teachers and the connections they have to each other and other wizzarding families. I just don't like all of the ""action"" happening all at one time...I almost put the book down and gave up...but I knew something great was about to happen..or so I thought... This is not the best book starring Harry, but it was ok..if you have not purchased the book yet..wait for the paperback."
4,The magic wanes slightly,"For me the fourth Harry Potter book was so different that I did not fully get it and therefore did not fully like it, and I gave it a 4 out 5. I probably did not appreciate it as much as I should have if I understood it better. However, the exact same thing happened with the fifth book. Harry starts so much more emotionally darker than before, that I was just caught off guard at his mood change. Some say teenage angst, but also he does have a lot more to deal with, I mean considering Voldemort's return and the standardized tests that helps decide a large part of his future. In addition, with so many more pages, Harry's personality is delved into deeper and deeper, especially in his relationships with his friends, his godfather Sirius, and his crush, Cho. All this made for a busy book, but I felt it was so different then before, that I was kind of overwhelmed. Overall I did like it, but it just was not, in my humble opinion, as great as the first three."
3,"Nothing much new here, 870-page installment.","I understand the Voldemort returns factor had to be dark and foreboding, but this book lacked any of the humor of the last four. The book seemed to need editing in the first 600 pages.A few nice surprises explaining a few things. But the death didn't have the punch I think the author intended. It just sort of happened, lackluster.Harry's anger bothered me. He was whiney and cranky as another reviewer mentioned. Overall, there just wasn't a lot of excitement in the first 800 pages. You learn a few things key to the story going back and looking forward, but what I really waited for was exposed in the final few chapters.Of course I'll anxiously await the next one. And of course I'll probably reread Goblet of Fire."
3,i love her books but this one was just ok,the best harry potter book was book 3....this book 5 kind of i don't know how to says it w/out spoiling it but ppl still should read it though....it still good but not the best of the 5 books you'll c why when u read it or for ppl who have read it your probably know why it deals with sirius
5,Was it worth the wait?,"Rowling does it once again ... another great HP book. Like the other books in this series the imagery is fantastic, the spells are original and the plot keeps the reader reading. ****Beware**** unlike the previous HP books Order of the Phoenix is missing something although no one seems to be able to pin point it. it may be that readers have had to wait a little longer to receive this book but good writing takes time. while the ending of this book may not give you that same feeling of anticipation as the last four books, it is still a great read!P.S. to those who comment on the length of the book - you are getting your money's worth and more detail of the HP world"
4,Another great Harry Potter book!,"J.K. Rowling has done it again. The world she creates is so rich that it just envelopes the reader and makes you lose all track of time.I agree with the other reviewer about the person she chose to kill, as they were my favorite character, and that's why the 4 star rating. Though I think she may have left an opening for them to reappear later. See Harrys last conversation with Luna Lovegood.My only other complaint is I waited so long for this book, finished it in less than a week, and now have to wait probably 3 years for the next one! Get writing, Ms. Rowling!"
4,"Super, but is it long enough?","My daughter has already polished it off, after all that waiting and waiting! Arrived yesterday---THANK YOU AMAZON, and today she is done. She loved the plot---was fascinated by it, but thought it came along rather late in the book."
5,I absolutely loved it,I absolutely loved this book. Right from the beginning it captured your attention with action and unanswered questions. The author added many new and exciting characters and also put in many interesting details about the backgrounds of returning characters. I strongly advise everyone to buy this book. It is by far the best she has written and I cannot wait until she comes out with the 6th book
5,J.K. Rowlings best so far,The first two chapters you actully start to dislike Harry. But that all changes not to far into the book. J.K. Rowling outdid herself this time. Yes Harry fights Deatheaters and Dementors in this book. He also teaches. Can't wait for book 6.
5,Two Wands Up,"Harry Potter and the order of the Phoenix was one of the best books I have ever read. I like how they combine the smallest details from the previous books to make this one killer suspense novel. Anyone who reads this book will understand exactly what I mean. Sometimes the book will want to make you rage, cry, or shout YIP-PE till you can't no more.THIS BOOK IS A MUST READ!!"
2,A sad Reader,"Don't get me wrong, I'm CRAZY about Harry Potter books, but the 5th book as let me very disapointed. I was eagerly awaiting the 5th book, I stayed all night at a Harry Potter PArty just so I could be one of the first people to get the new book. Usually Harry Potter books are the kind of book that you can't put down, can't sleep until you finish it. Well with book 5 I could have put it down at any moment and been perfectly fine. The book was WAY to long, and the story seemed to just keep dragging on and on. At the end you finaly get some action BUT THEN SHE KILLS Off ONE O THE COOLEST CHARCTER!!!!!!!! I really hope that JK comes up with something that measures up to her first 4 books, for her 6th book, until then though, I will remain, A Sad Reader :("
3,Pretty Good,"I know that Harry Potter is growing up and that the books cover an entire year, but it seems like he grew up an awful lot between the last book and this one. It was still a good book, but it's definately moved from older kid to young adult. There is less fantasy/adventure and more politics."
3,Needs some judicious editing,"Like its predecessor, Goblet, Phoenix should have been cut down a bit. There is far too much of the Order sneaking around and Harry and the crew trying to figure out what is happening.Rowling does a great job showing Harry as a less than happy teen (Considering what he's been through, it's amazing he's as well adjusted as he is) and the rest of the crew mill about smartly but it is just too much standing around and waiting for things to happen, page after page.The snappy finale almost makes up for it and that's all I'll say about that.Potter continues to be one of the great creations of fantasy, but like Steven King, J.K. Rowling could use a bit of the philosophy ""Less is More."""
4,An Excellent Read,"To those who are having doubts about whether they should return to the Harry Potter universe, I say, jump right back in. The book has a decidedly edgier and darker feel to it, but Harry is now a teenager who feels that he should have more responsibility than he does. But what teen hasn't thought that way. The characters are still as enjoyable, and it is exciting to see their development through out the book series.It is a long book, and some parts can be slow, but it is worth the read. Some plot lines that have been nurtured in the other books come to fruitation, and some plot lines are just beginning. I think it is worth the time to re-enter Harry's world."
4,Disappointing,"My entire family was waiting anxiously for this book, and although it's OK, none of the characters was positive, even Mrs. Weasley is snappy and unfriendly. It also has at least 100 unecessary pages, the prose should be tighter, and the book in general could have used more editing.On the other hand, it took me 2 1/2 days to finish it, so it isn't THAT bad...:)."
2,not what i expected at all,"My rating would be like 2.5. The book started off so good it was really interesting, I was so excitied because I love these books! I was upset after reading the entire middle finding out it was not as interesting as it was said to be. I did not like the ending of the book though, just one word TWO, how can there be two? But, I loved the hints Rowling threw at us. I knew what was going on the entire time. I expected more from this book."
4,Darker and Deeper than before!,"It is a little creepier than before - Harry's temper really shocked me at first, but his explosions have explanations. The Dark Arts teacher is described as having a personality like ""poisoned honey"", but it is really more like sickly sweet poison! O.W.L.s are stressed a LOT, but students don't worry too much - until the exams. The Weasley twins are back at their old tricks, testing products for their new joke shop... Hagrid, he comes back from his secret mission with... Not telling. Oh, and Mrs. Umbridge, the Dark Arts teacher, starts an Inqisition Squad, and guess who's on it? No, guess! To get back, Harry and several friends start an ""illegal"" club.All right, if that hasn't sparked your curiosity, you probably don't deserve to read the book!"
2,A Disgrace,"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix in my opinion was a complete fiasco made sheerly out of anger, hatred, and confusion. The very end of the book where Dumbledore explains everything does not explain anything at all, and his excuse for not telling Harry over the years does not make sense at all. Harry supposedly is entering puberty with his hormones. He needs anger management desperately. Still a complete fan of Rowling, this book seems like a major set back from her first four fantastic books. I hope she isn't losing her touch, but it sure seems like it with her latest addition to the Harry Potter series."
3,Okay DVD,"This DVD has a great story line behind it, it brings across so many different points that deal with real life. So many times Christians don't like to deal with some of this stuff. However, the singing in this movie was not one of the greatest."
5,A Great Movie,I really enjoyed this movie!!! This is a great movie to watch and discuss with your significant other!!! Very up to date with concerns and fears we have in relationships. Best Code Black movie I have seen in a while.
3,An at home movie!,"From the previews I couldn't wait to see this movie I mean I was so excited to get this movie that the moment it came I popped some popcorn and got ready to watch this movie.My problem with this movie is not that it wasn't good it just wasn't great. The characters never truly unfolded and it left you asking why didn't they go deeper into some situations.It could have just been in the editing but ""Editing"" is very important to any film.Bottom line is it is still a good movie to have in your collection at home!"
3,Slow Start,"Even though this video had a slow start, overall it's pretty good. Dewitt Henson does an extra job as a christain man fighting to keep his family together. The highlight of the movie was Deborah Cox singing in church toward the end."
2,Yawwnnn,"I love Golden Brooke and Darrin Dewin Henson (he played a much better church man in Fabric of a Man) but this was a dud for me. It had its moments here and there but most of the movie was very predictable and seem to drag on. It lacked any type of oomph and the moments you were left wanting to know more it just cut to the next scene, and never went back to wrap that issue up. Sorry this one didn't do it for me."
5,Good Christian Movie,"Believe it or not, I had never heard of this movie and just happened to see it while I was ordering some other movies and decided to order it as well. It was a very good clean movie - with a good theme."
2,A Good Man Is Hard to Find,"Poor story and acting ,5/10 at the most,wouldnt have bought it if I had known"
3,"skyliners 2, published by Hamlin",Please try to find it and reply me the cost of the above mention book in other to confirm the request. Thanks
5,One of the best Children's CD's out there,This cd was recommended to me by a friend. I play it every time my daughter goes to sleep. It's the perfect lullaby cd. All the songs are soft and beautiful. It doesn't go back and forth from slow to fast as some albums do. I would recommend this to anyone with children. It's a wonderful relaxing album.
5,"I dont know who loves this CD more, me or my kids!","I first heard this CD while on my first day of work at a Daycare and fell in love with it instantly. I had to have this for my children, as well as myself. There is just something about this Cd that appeals to adults and children alike. I had recently moved and the Cd was lost in the move, I had both &quot;Return to pooh corner&quot; and &quot;More songs from Pooh Corner&quot; and I hadnt had the chance to buy them again. Now that I am pregnant with our 3rd baby, I plan to buy 2 copies of each, for the new baby as well as for my other 2!"
5,Best lullaby CD!,This CD is amazing! We have been working on getting our 4 month daugher to transition to sleeping in her crib at night and have been reading up on bedtime routines. We set a great routine with her around 3.5 months but getting her to actually fall asleep was extremely difficult. We would start to lay her in the crib and she'd have a fit. I tried another lullaby CD to see if that would help but it wasn't as calming and parts of the songs seemed to wake her up more. This CD is WONDERFUL! We've used it only a few days and now when I turn it on her eyes start to close and she's asleep before the first song ends. That first song is also a tear jerker- my husband and I were crying while listening to it and looking at our daugher sleep. This is a great purchase for all the parents trying to teach their kids how to self sooth and sleep on their own or who are working through a sleep transition.
5,cd,"love this cd got it for my grandaughter, my son also listened to it when he was baby, very calming, shipped very quickly also, four days."
5,A must have,"A must have for all parents, grandparents and lovers of POOH and fans of Kenny Loggins. I LOVE IT (I'm the grandmother of 2 2year olds and a soon to be 4 year old and have bought 3 of these already (unfortunately only one from Amazon). It's soothing and takes one back to one's own childhood."
5,Perfect Lullibies,"Our family loves this CD, Return To Pooh Corner. Kenny Loggins' voice is so soothing and comforting. Every parent should have this one. Too good to miss."
3,Not a new cd,"While the cd does work well and I enjoy the music, I was a little upset to find that I did not receive a factory-sealed brand-new cd. I received a used copy. There is black writing on my cd and while it was re-wrapped, it did not have the seal that cds have. I wish I would have know this before purchasing."
5,beautiful lullaby album,"""Return To Pooh Corner"" is a beautifully done lullaby album by Kenny Loggins. The album will appeal to both kids and adults.Tag: childrens music"
5,Special part of Childhood,"You know how you hear sounds or smell smells that take you back in time to some special place? That is how we feel about this CD! My children (seven and ten) are STILL listening to this music! Kenny Loggins is wonderful. His voice is soothing, his songs sweet and not at all typical of children's music. We have all of his CD's and I highly recommend you get them too and let them become special to your family!"
2,Danger Warning,Under no circumstance play this album while driving a car. It is a dangerous soporific!This album does have two good cuts. The major fault lies in all the cuts so much alike. Just one long and not particularly good lullaby.
1,Don't Waste Your Money!,"If you're looking for some beautiful and well crafted music to help your children relax before they go to sleep by a CD called the ""Lullaby Collection."" This CD is horrible. I foolishly listened to all of the five star reviews and now have in my possession a CD from a washed up rock star that bores my children to tears. The CD contains syrupy, overproduced and uninspired versions of children's songs that simply do not interest my children. For example, the dreadful version of the classic ""Pure Imagination"" from Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory cannot be salvaged by Gene Wilder's spoken introduction. My advice is to stay as far away from this CD as possible."
5,Calm Your Crying Baby,"I recommend this album to any new parent looking for a way to calm both you and your frazzled baby. My love for Winnie the Pooh prompted me to purchase the CD, but I was pleased to find that I enjoyed all of the songs. My son loves the music -- it's the only CD that soothes him. We play it for him every night before his bedtime. If you are looking for a good CD for both you and your little one, consider Return to Pooh Corner."
5,Soothing music for everyone...,"We've had the cassette for over 5 years and then purchased the CD a couple of years ago. It's the best music to listen and even sing along too. We always take it with us when we travel on vacation. It's the first tape that gets played in the car because it's not just for kids or babies, but adults too. It sure does take your mind off of traffic. ENJOY..."
5,My Son Loves It,My 4 year old son listened to Kenny Loggins cds during nap timeat his daycare center. He was singing the words to House On PoohCorner so I decided to buy this cd for him. He loves it! I like it too forthe nostalgia of it.
5,This is a fantastic CD! I would recommend this to anyone!,"I first heard this CD when my sister brought it home from college. I fell in love with it instantly, especially ""All The Pretty Ponies"" which I believe is a lullaby from the Victorian Era. I asked for a copy of my own for Christmas and have not stopped playing it ever since.I have actually, through Amazon.com, bought two more copies to give as baby shower gifts."
5,I would give this CD 10 stars if I could!!!!,"I got this CD a few weeks ago and every time I put it in the player, my daughter settles down and eventually goes to sleep. She's a very mellow baby anyway, but even when she's all cranky in the backseat and I can't do anything because I'm driving, by the middle of All the Pretty Ponies, she is quiet and loving life.I was just reading the lyrics to these songs while waiting in line at the drive-thru at Wendy's. I had a couple tears well up with Return to Pooh Corner and St. Judy's Comet.I'm buying another copy to give my sister-in-law who just had her first baby yesterday. This is a MUST for every loving parent."
5,Loggins Comes Back to What He Does Best,"Kenny Loggins, though some of his more pop music has risen on the charts,Loggins scores a big hit with this simple and wonderful album, that will probably never ""hit it big."". Similiar to the gentle ballads on Celebrate Me Home, Return to Pooh Corner is some of the purest vocal and acoustic guitar I've heard in a long time. Not one song is poorly done. The kids may like it, but the adults will enjoy it even more."
4,Kenny Loggins continues writing great soft music,"This is a very good CD, but it's more for the younger people, because it is basicaly a CD full of lulabys. If you have a young child(1 to 5) it's a must have"
1,not what i wanted,I ordered the text intro to finance but received the study guide. So now I am right back where I started with 3 weeks left in class.
4,Country girl with attitude,"I gotta say I love this CD. Her fiery performance on the CMA awards with ""Kerosene"" is what caused me to buy it. I wasn't disappointed. This is a very sweet country girl with some attitude & that's what attracted me to the songs. There are some nice love songs but it's peppered with some rock/country songs with lots of bang. I missed her on Nashville Star but she is definately worthy of country stardom!"
5,Kerosene,"Miranda Lambert is again at her best in this album. Her rendition of ""Kerosene"" leads the list along with ""White Liar"", ""Only Prettier"", she just keeps rollling them out. I confess, I'm hooked: on her voice - and that wee - bit of an accent. Add it all up and it's Miranda at her best - again."
5,Country doesn't always suck,"I don't listen to a lot country but ""Kerosene"" is a great song. Love the music, lyrics and Miranda is VERY nice to look at. : She has a great country sound."
5,what a great country album!,"I bought this album after seeing her music video ""Me and Charlie Talking"" and after listening to the whole cd, I was really impressed! Miranda dosen't seem to be going for the current pop-rock/top 40 country career. Her songs do well on the charts because her music is reminisent of the traditional country/blue-grass genre."
4,Good CD,I didn't really notice Miranda much until I saw her on the CMA awards. What a performance! Although her voice lacks some maturity and depth but she has potential for some amazing future albums. Her songwriting is great but the vocals need more emotion.
5,Great song writer... Great Singer,"She is only going to get better with age. This is one of only a few CD's that I constantly reach for to listen too. She is a breathe of fresh air, she is not another Faith or Martina.If your sitting on the fence and not sure.... go for it, you won't be disappointed."
1,No.,"I heard her song ""Kerosene,"" and realized I would rather choke than ever hear another song by her. No one cares if you want to burn down your boyfriends house. No wonder he is cheating on you. I probably would too, if I were dating a crazy woman.Country at its worst."
1,Unfortunate debut,"While I agree Amanda Lambert has all the qualities to be a new country music star,I find it difficult to get past the title cut,`Kerosene`.Previous reviewer Jeff Fazekas called the song a sister version of a Steve Earle rocker.The fact is,it`s a sped up version of Steve Earle`s `I feel alright`,complete with a well placed `Ha!` as in Earle`s song.I was furious the first time I heard it.It`s a total musical ripoff,different lyrics.I wrote Steve Earle management and told them,and their reply was,""We are aware of it,and it`s been dealt with.` So I`m not alone on this.Hard to give her praise,when she`s selling music that`s not hers,nor giving credit where due,for the music."
5,Fantastic,"I was seriously taken aback by how much i enjoyed this cd. I didnt do what i normally do and listen to snippets beforehand. I wanted to see if could get a cd and just enjoy it straight from jump. I did in a big way with Kerosene. Miranda Lambert is a seriously talented artist and just as good songwriter. She has a hand in almost every song on the whole cd and i can't help but feel that touch on all of the songs on her debut cd. I know that it did well overall not that it would have mattered. i still would have made the choice to purchase this cd by a stunning up and coming artist no frills, no gimmicks or anything just natural talent and that is why i really enjoy not only Kerosene but music in general. You have a new fan in me Miranda. Keep on doing what you love and people will be there to buy it. You rock, best of luck..awesome debut CD.Favs - Kerosene, Greyhound Bound For Nowhere, I Can't Be Bothered and There's A Wall (all of the rest rock as well)"
4,Lov'n it,I'm glad that I got this CD. I'm really enjoying it. Miranda has a great voice and has a unique writing style.
4,Good first effort,"Hmmmm, a previous reviewer gave one star, stating that the music isn't Miranda's. Gee, country music artists deriving from previous country musicians. Imagine that.Actually, the ""Ha!"" in ""Kerosene"" owes nothing to Steve Earle; it's clearly echoing the vengeful female ""Ha!"" in ""These Boots are Made for Walking,"" set within the very same context of ""lighting a fire"" so that the dude in question ""learns a lesson."" I've been in touch with Nancy Sinatra management, and they said they'd deal with Steve Earle.BTW, the opening riff of ""New Strings"" sounds like Led Zepplin's ""Ramble On."" Not that Bonnie Raitt ever was inspired by their special way of doing the blues."
3,Solid production,"Miranda Lambert is more than just a pretty face, although she certainly is that. This CD illustrates her competence at ballads and rockers. The title track is my favorite, but it's not the only thing here. Worth the price of admission"
3,OK debut album,"This cd is ok. At least it is a debut album. ok vocals and sound. ok lyrics. not bad, but not the best."
5,Perfect Restoration Tires,"I was delighted to find the exact same model of tire as was originally on the bike twenty years ago. Good service, product, and price. Recommend."
3,decent inexpensive tire.,3 stars because the whitewall faded from sitting in my dark garage. Not cool. They seem to ride fine but they already look dirty after 2 uses on dry pavement.
1,"Crummy product, keep looking","These tires seemed like a good bargain. Unfortunately they're a very inferior product.The bead is extremely small and was somewhat difficult to mount in my bike's wheel rim. The whitewall width is uneven, which looks pretty stupid when the wheel is spinning.I used them anyway but next time will pay more for a much better product. I recommend you pass this by."
4,Help! I'm in the wrong job!,"I wish I were ready for this book years ago! Lee and Larry start by describing the workplace and how it is changing (surprisingly accurate for being published in 1993). Next they define what work is and help us understand why so many people are in the situations they are in. Then comes the fun part...identifying your skills, interests, personality and applying them to a career that fits you. Lastly they teach you how to conduct a job search, prepare your resume and how to manage you finances.The book is an excellent resource in itself. However, the companion workbook is a must in order to get the full benefit of the program."
2,The book was not as expected,I was quite disappointed by this book which seemed stiff and dry. - Not the variety of approaches or counseling perspective I was expecting.
3,A little old school,"Bought this to wear for a special evening event. When I got this bra it reminded me of the long line bra that my grandmother used to wear. It is snug and kinda scratchy and the cups are a little too pointy. However if you are looking for a ""waist cincher"" and back smoother for a few hours - this is a good choice."
3,Straps are a bother,"The unfinished straps on this bra and the wide metal 'feeds' they are held in are extremely irritating. The lace fabric also is a bit itchy, even though I washed it twice in Woolite. Furthermore, the bra cups give you that awful Fifties' 'bullet look.' I guess you can say that I did not like the bra -- I threw it away and ordered something else from Flexees."
3,Early works by a future Top Forty star,"Lorrie Morgan""Oh Boy Classics Presents: Lorrie Morgan""(Oh! Boy Records, 2002)-----------------------------------------------------Like Pam Tillis, singer Lorrie Morgan comes from country music royalty, being the daughter of 1950s crooner George Morgan. Doubtless this helped her get her foot in the door and start a career in Nashville. Still, like everybody else she had to make demo tapes first, and this release on John Prine's eclectic Oh Boy label unearths Morgan's early studio work, tracks that were clearly recorded before her 1989 major label debut. It's no the greatest country music ever, but it's interesting to hear her working in a more modest country mode (her hits were pretty glossy and high-tech) and also to hear the earnestness and youth in her voice. Certainly worth checking out if you are a fan. (DJ Joe Sixpack, Slipcue Guide To Country Music)"
2,"Lorrie's good, but the songs are cheesy","Lorrie is a great vocalist and that is the only reason I don't doze off listening to this collection of cheesy love songs. It so reinforces the stereotype of 'girl' singers. When 6 out of 10 song titles either start or end with the word love, you know something is wrong. I don't have anything against love songs, but there's no need to be so squishy about it. In some songs, you can hear traces of her trademark gutsy drawl. I only recommend this for die hard fans or people who appreciate early 1980's pop country."
5,essential,"A good representation of the man and his underrated music. He expresses parts of music unfamiliar to modern ears; showmanship, kindness and good humor. A chicken ain't nothin but a bird knocks me out."
3,A few issues,"The book has its value for discussing in detail several schools throughout the country. I would even say it is a must-have before you visit ANY film school (even if's not in the book). The grudge I have is how the authors sometimes weigh in with their personal preferences while discussing school facts (eg, they call Valencia, CA ""depressing to live"" - while that may be true it is highly subjective and should not be mentioned in a section which is supposed to inform an applicant). The introductory chapters are helpful, but the authors on occasion fall for juvenile foot-in-mouth comments like minimizing the work of McKee and Field by arguing they haven't had any produced screenplays (which is ridiculous - that's like saying a Superbowl team coach sucks because he can't throw a ball like Joe Montana). The glossary is tongue in cheek but is obviously filler, no substance. Other than that, if one ignores these annoyances the book can be helpful."
4,Good overview of graduate film programs,Overview of the top graduate film programs: gives good insight into each program and their respective strengths and characteristics. Very helpful in understanding the 'signature' of a school. Would be great to have an equivalent for undergrad film programs!
3,"Schools'list is pretty good, but the format could be better","I think that this book was supposed to be an insighful reference for people, who are thinking about film studies on all levels. It is quite insightful, but as a reference book it lacks n easy-to-use format. Also, it does not list some of the good schools, that I found out about from another sources (movie magazines and internet). Overall, it is not worth spending $11-14 on... $4-5? May be, but no more than that."
4,A great place to start if interested in film school,"This is the first of the literature I read while thinking about a career in film. This book is brutally honest about the highly competitive film industry and I'm glad because I don't want false ego-lifting encouragement. The bulk of this book thoroughly explains the major film school in the US including the cost, curriculum, reputation, available equipment, professor/student relations. What I found to be most useful are the little tips and tricks you can use to gain an edge on pursuing a career in film. Buy this book if your thinking about pursuing film and you want unbiased advice."
4,"A rating of various graduate-school, film programs.","I am a high school senior applying to film schools across the country, and I found FILM SCHOOL CONFIDENTIAL to be a very helpful book. Not only did it rate the film-schools in various categories , but it also gave an in-depth analysis on each program and an HONEST review of each program. The reviews of each film-school are given from the perspective of a student, rather than a perspective from a teacher. Unfortunetly, the book focuses on Graduate-film studies, rather than undergraduate studies (but the book is still helpful). About 40 of America's top film-schools are reviewed. In conclusion, I would have to say that this book is a MUST-BUY for anyone who is thinking about attending film-school. It gives concise and honest reviews on most of the top film schools in the country."
2,"Disappointed, but should have known better!","I knew this dvd would not be worth the price, but I was lured in by my 2 yr olds love of the Higglytown Heroes and JoJo. There are only two actual episodes on the dvd, one Higglytown and one JoJo's Circus. Then there are a couple other shorts that have no holiday theme whatsoever. We have another Playhouse Disney holiday vhs from a few years ago and it was the same thing, one holiday episode and the rest not holiday at all. While my kids and I love Playhouse Disney, you would be much better off recording the shows yourself."
4,Train,"He likes the train. We all do. It is made of hardwood and made in the USA, We don't have to worry about lead paint."
1,Wrong size,Size is not even close to the size it says. I would assume at least 10sizes smaller than what is states.
1,From Back Cover,"Eden Harcourt had never planned to actually shoot Devlin Stryker--she'd only meant to scare him away from the isolated Montana cabin where she was vacationing. Now the wounded cowboy lay helpless in her bed as a fierce Rocky Mountain blizzard whirled outside.Dev was furious! How could anyone be so careless with a rifle? Now he was bound to be stranded in close quarters for days, maybe even weeks... with a beautiful woman. He was too weak to do anything about it--yet. But he was growing stronger.At first, Eden was taken aback by Dev's unrestrained desire and the intensity of her passion. But fate had placed them on a powder keg--and an explosion was inevitable."
5,I need more Maggots,"What a great CD!! )Yet another fine disk from Wicked Cool Records!!!--Thanks Little Steven.)If you are a fan of garage rock this is a must have!! Ain't Nothing but a Maggot, the first track, sets the pace for this brilliant disk. I think Nothing but a Heartache is my favorite track and will be a classic one day. Get this incredible disk immediately and you'll be nothing but a maggot baby too!!!"
3,Useless without the tape,"ISBN 0934323038 - This book and cassette set is standard Teddy Ruxpin, and if you're a fan - or your child is! - you'll enjoy it. I'm not a fan, but did find the story cute. The illustrations are nice, bright and detailed. The greatest negative is that the book, alone, is absolutely useless, because the bulk of the story is on the cassette. If you're buying it used, be sure that the seller has the tape, or you'll have a book with a very disjointed story!- AnnaLovesBooks"
5,Love this CD!,"This is our thrid copy of this CD. The first was lent to us when our baby was born. We loved it so much we bought our own copy, so we wouldn't wear out our friend's copy. Then we decided we needed a copy for the car as well as our baby's room. She falls asleep to it every night now. The only problem is it's a little too short to get through rocking and then our baby falling asleep. Sometimes I have to come back into her room to play it again."
5,wonderful lullaby music/memory maker,"I was given this CD when my first child was born. I listened to it every night as I rocked her to sleep. All the songs are beautiful and when I lost the CD, I purchased another one for my second child. Now that they are a little bit older, we still listen to it together in our house and in the car. This music will always remind me of that special time when my children were babies. It is a great shower gift for mothers-to-be."
5,A MUST HAVE,"No words can really describe how absolutely wonderful this CD is. I heard ""Oh Bear"" at,ironically, the Vermont Teddy Bear Store. I was also pregnant with my first child. I asked the clerk who it was and she got the info for me. It was the best purchase ever. I play it almost every day and never tire of it. It is great for children and adults. Very peaceful music and lyrics. It has become my signature shower gift."
2,Disappointed in cultural and christian messages & music.,"I bought this CD on the strength of the reviews of the lullabies and was unprepared for words like ""mommy takes care of me all day, then daddy comes home from work and we play"". Also many overtly christian (if innocuous) references in the songs to ""our Father watches over me from above"", references to Jesus, etc. The music is also very orchestrated, with lots of violins, etc. -- I was MUCH happier with the international collections of simple lullabies I bought here-- ""The World Sings Goodnight"" and ""Lullaby- a Collection""."
2,Misled by these other Amazon reviews,"I purchased this CD after reading the glowing reviews here on Amazon.com. I've now heard the CD 20 or 30 times. It is truly disappointing! Many of the songs are hokey and amateurish. It became a little joke between my twins and I once they got old enough to minimally converse. ""Daddy only likes one song on this CD."" Try ""Mimi Bessette/Broadway"" or ""Lullaby: A Collection"" for music you'll enjoy while rocking your children."
2,Disappointing,"I bought this CD because of the excellent reviews, and was very disappointed. The music itself is flat and uninspiring, and the words contained religious references with which not everyone may be comfortable."
5,Love it!,"When my granddaughter was born, I spent many wee hours rocking her to this cd so her mommy and daddy could sleep. I live several hours away and sometimes I play this cd when I am away from her just to bring back those feelings that I had rocking my sweet baby granddaugther to these beautiful and sweet songs."
5,A Beautiful CD,"I originally bought this CD shortly after its release in 1994 for my then infant daughter. It played over and over in her room. Since then, my son and other daughter both have listened to it over and over, too. It is, most definitely, the prettiest music in our CD collection.Still, on certain nights, my son, now 8 and a ""big, tough"" hockey player, requests that we put ""Oh Bear, Oh Bear"" on his CD player ""and make it play over and over"". It comforts him now, just as it did when he was tiny.Why a review now after so long? I am buying it for a friend who is expecting her first child. I want to share this treasure with her."
5,A wonderful CD,"I bought this CD for my wife before my son was born and gave it to her when she was in the Delivery Room. We listened to it while she was in labor and then, when my son was born, we played ""Welcome to the World"" as a tribute to him and to give us an audio memory of that first time we saw our little boy. Our little boy is two now and we still love this CD. I get tears in my eyes whenever I hear Graham Nash singing, ""The Moment I Saw You."" This CD and its songs have even more meaning knowing this mom has died and her daughter has this collection of music written for her."
5,A must have!!,"This is an excellent CD. I was impressed with all of the great reviews this CD had. So, I purchased it. I agree that it is soothing to both babies and parents. Our 4 month old son sleeps peaceful to her sounds. Even my husband and I sing the songs around the house! It is a must have. Next time I need a baby shower gift, this is what I am buying!!"
1,Disappointed,"I purchased all of Larsin's releases...this past week, to add to my collection. This is a tired sleeper, even for a child. I removed it from my collection. As far as her other c d's, they are ok....but nothing really stands out, or hooks you. Lotta Love, is the winner. If you were to buy just one c d...I think her Best Hits would be your best bet. Love her vocals, always have. She just never found a formula that would work for her."
3,I have other recommendations.,"To be fair, I don't own this CD, I've only listened to the on-line samples. But I wanted to recommend an alternative to other customers: my favorite lullaby music is done by the pusblisher ""Someday Baby"". They have several for sale by Amazon. My favorite is ""A Child's Gift of Lullabies"". They're original songs which I find refreshing. The songs on ""A Child's Gift..."" are all sung by Tonya Goodman Sykes, and then are repeated with just the instrumental. You can use the lyrics booklet that comes with the CD to sing along. Also, in other CDs I found it disruptive to have ""guest singers"". If you're really trying to put your child to sleep, I think it's better to have one song blend into the next. Perhaps not enough variety for adults, but it's very soothing for kids."
5,A Must Have!,"My daughter, Winnie, absolutely loves this CD. Grandpa bought it for her when she was about 6 weeks old and I don't know what we would do without it. The music never seems to get old and I really like the lyrics. It reminds me just how special it is to be a father, especially when I think about Nicolette's tragic passing. Whenever we play it, I'm glad for the time I get to spend with Winnie. My wife and I plan to give this CD to everyone we know that is having a baby.I can honestly say that I don't have a favorite song because they're all great! I can tell that Nicolette put her heart and soul into these songs. If you get it, you won't be disappointed."
5,Beautiful and moving,"In our family's experience, this is music guaranteed to calm even the fussiest baby to sleep. It's also great for soothing mom's nerves if she's getting a bit frazzled. The whole album is excellent, with tracks 3 through 5 being my very favorites. Track #3 is especially poignant in light of Nicolette's untimely death. What a beautiful legacy she has left for families everywhere."
3,"Wheres the ""Live"" ?","While this CD DOES cover Janies best songs, the ""Live"" part isn't much (except for crowd noise). I skimmed it and didn't hear any talking before, during or after songs. Pretty good mix. I wish I had bought it ""used"" on Amazon."
4,Zeta Gundam MG 2.0,"This is much better than the original Master Grade Zeta Gundam in terms of joints holding up and posability. However, I do have the Hi-Nu Gundam MG and it feels like that model has even stronger joints. One of the arms seemed to sag when I attached the beam rifle to it.The transformation is still complicated... I found it best to seperate the upper torso from the legs and do the transformations of each individually. But since it's a PITA and there's a chance the joints will get weaker over time, I will probably limit the times I transform it."
2,Extremely disappointed.,"This is a beautiful and well made piece, but when they describe this pendant as large and polished they are not exaggerating. The heart is extremely large and heavy, measuring over 1 1/2 inches wide and 1 inch tall. It weighs very heavily on the delicate chain. At this size, the finish is way too shiny and reflective. Perhaps if on a thicker chain, or even a shorter chain, the pendant would not weigh down and pull as much. This is definitely not a piece for every day wear, which is what I was looking for.This necklace is gorgeous, and I love the message, but I don't want to spend more money and time trying to find an appropriate chain and I'd rather wear something not so large.If you're looking for something like this, and also don't want an extremely large piece, check out the ""Far Fetched"" line by ""Something Silver""."
2,Already leaking at two years!,"I loved this teapot and have owned it for a little over two years. I use it almost daily. Last week, I found that it was leaking just under the spout---all over the counter. Apparently, the weld isn't holding. I contacted [...] from whom I purchased it on 6/24/10. Today is 6/29 and I have had not reply to my inquiry about returning it to them. At about $50 (including the shipping), I'm not happy and unfortunately cannot recommend this pot to anyone and am not too happy with this distributor, either."
5,"Great Tea, Great Looks","I bought one of these teapots several years ago and loved it, but could never find another one. This is exactly like the first one I bought and is exactly what I wanted. Makes great tea and looks good too!"
3,Read it for Shershavin,"Historians will be disappointed with this book. I read it looking for particulars and details and was disappointed to find that it was essentially an adventure story filled with generalities and superlatives. But it was late at night, I wasn't sleepy, and I kept reading.I'm very glad that I did because, despite any flaws in the author's historical methodology, he is a wonderful storyteller. If you are not too sophisticated to allow yourself, when encountering an issue of Reader's Digest, to immediately turn to the ""Drama in Real Life"" section, you must read this book simply for the chapter detailing the bridge-demolition mission of a Soviet sapper named Shershavin. The story is well-told and unforgettable."
1,Look somewhere else.,"The book, while entertaining, has very little historical accuracy. If you wnat a good book about that battle go to Nipe or Glantz."
1,I could not dissagree more with this author!,"Just a brief note. It was hard for me even to get through this text. A trusted friend of mine was a close associate of Agnes Sanford and trusted her implicitly, witnessing many very beautiful and freeing healing events at her hands which were hands of Love. Ms. Grumprecht's book is a rigid, narrow look at a person of great integrity and deep Christian faith...""by their fruits ye shall know them..."""
1,Abusing the bible,"Let me sum up this book, the author disagrees with everything Agnes Sanford said, did or stood for except when she ( sanford ) indulges in some self criticism. The author uses her detailed knowledge of the bible, puts her own ( influenced ) interpretation on it and then uses this to somehow disprove sanfords theology as demonic! The author accepts that the bible in its present form is as originally written despite many translations and re-interpretations (eg I am told that some very old versions of the bible have no references to hell ). Sanfords book ""The healing light"" is a message of hope and Love. This book fosters doubt and despair, the author sits in judgement of sanford, I dont know why she has taken the time to write it. I think it will appeal to all christian zealots who are easily influenced, critical and on the authors similar vague quest for recognition and re-assurance, possibly other members of the ""we are on earth to suffer"" brigade."
5,Interesting,"My husband ordered this movie, the story of which the action takes place in a cafe and uncovers the lives of the customers that patronize it. The ending is unexpected, and when I asked my husband if he would order the DVD after seeing the movie on TV, he responded that he would want it for our video library."
3,Cafe',"If you are a Geek, understand avatars, enjoy JLH, like Indy movies... then this is for you. Had fun with the movie... not a blockbuster, but certainly an enjoyable experience. h"
4,This movie is not for everyone,It is a sort of a cute movie of a the coffee shop. I particularly liked was a girl who plays God. The story kept me interested as the plot changed in interesting ways. The ending I thought could have been better.The acting was good. It was filmed well.It was enjoyable.
1,Stupid!!!!!!!,"This movie was soooooooooo SUPER LAME!!!!!!!! This was one of the stupidest movies ever! It drags on the whole time and the ending is really dumb. I think Daniel Eric Gold was the best actor in it. Jamie Kennedy really got fat and ugly in it. don't waste your time, people!"
1,Don't waste your money on this one,"The story starts out slowly and drags most of the way. I must say that it starts to develop interesting relationships between characters and has a new twist on the 'Matrix' theme. However, the writers couldn't come up with logical conclusions with the character relationships and ends them abruptly. The movie reaches a point were it is quite depressing but in order to come up with a happy ending, the writers come up with an absolutely ridiculous end."
3,Jennifer Love,Love Jennifer Love. Who doesnt. Bought because of her. However this movie is weird.lol. good but Its been sitting on the shelf watched only once. Shes a great actress. I do hope to see better things from her soon
3,caf'e,"It was slow going and weird. The only thing that saved it for me was ofcourse Jennifer Love Hewitt. This story line about us not really being on this planet??? I don't know It just isn't what I was expecting from Jennifer Love Hewitt.I guess a more sweeter, softer storyline."
2,Another waterCOLOR book with few COLOR paintings!,If you like Black & White photos of watercolor paintings this is the book for you. I personal like to view full color photos of watercolor paintings!
2,Catty Women,"Ugh. I was a huge fan of Olivia Goldsmith's First Wives Club and even though this is written by a different author, thought it might be a fun tale of the other side of the coin. I couldn't have been more wrong. Four vapid, self-absorbed women who, each in their own way, cut a married man from the herd and roped him in through deceit and sexual conquest, get together once a month to kvetch about the first wives and whine. This read like a bad soap opera with none of the women experiencing any real growth or moments of self-realization. Even the conflicts are solved by happenstance, not by any mature action by the characters. The razor sharp wit described in the blurb is non-existent. The only time I laughed was when one of the protagonists got hit by a car. And that was because I was thrilled to see at least one of these catty broads got knocked down. A miserable read."
5,Hard to put down!,"I loved how this book alternated chapters with the developments of each character. I absolutely couldn't stand Julia and found her really annoying but in a good book there's always gotta be someone you hate, right? This book was definitely her best yet...best writing, best characters. I never got bored and finished it very quickly."
5,Epic!,This is one of the best series I have read in a long time and each book seems to just get better and better! I can't wait to get into the fourth book soon.
1,Fantaswy?,I found this series of books hard going. I have read far more enthralling books in this type of genre
1,oud pick,"This is a joke. They describe it as ....""Plastic pick for the oud. Very flexible pick, 5"" x 0.25"" parallel sides, tapered ends. Color may vary."" They are a full HALF INCH wide and totally unusable"
4,Cute!,"I bought these earrings for my mom for Christmas and she loved them! They were a little bigger than I was expecting them to be, and not quite as nice (I thought the bikes were made out of metal but they actually weren't), but she was happy with them - so I was too. :)"
1,Reason Driven is the escalator to no where,"Same old arguments against Christian Faith coated with the emptiness of what Reason has to offer. A much better read is Has Christianity Failed You? By Ravi Zacharias (Chapter 6 specifically he dissect the sub-sophomoric response and says he could argue Price's points better than he could even though he believes differently). Foreword by a ""comedian""? That should give it plenty of academic ""stock"". Give me a break, usually its the Christians stealing ideas from the world, this guy wasn't clever enough to write a decent book on his own so he rides to coat tails of Warren. Hate on Warren all you want, his charity work is massive"
4,Solid,"This book is a hybrid, of sorts. On the one hand it serves as a direct response to The Purpose Driven life, very clearly and effectively rebutting claims that a fundamental Christian life is the only happy one. On the other hand it gives an independent guide to living a fulfilled, meaningful life from a completely secular angle. I recommend it."
4,"Refreshing, honest, and a relief","Instead of preaching and pressuring, Price lets you know what your life can really be instead of making you think it has to follow a prescription and misguided notions laid down by a preacher. Funny, sarcastic, and revealing chapters give you plenty of food for thought--and reason."
5,Amazing,"ALice in Chains is an incredible musical force. If you have liked even one of their albums, then you will love this one. It is amazingly somber yet beautiful in its own right."
5,Hits the mark yet again!,"This cd along with all the other Alice In Chains releases are top notch. Lane was a tremendous singer who left an impression with the angst of his existence in his delivery. It's to bad he couldn't fight off the demons that eventually took his life. All in all this band was excellent.They and Soundgarden are the only two grunge bands worth mentioning from that time period with maybe Nirvana tossed in the mix as well. However Nirvana although a very good band in it's own right, couldn't touch Alice In Chain or Soundgarden in my honest opinion.Alice In Chains was and always will be a great band period!!Buy it!"
5,Another great!,"Well, what can I say! Alice In Chains can't be stopped with this album, Jar Of Flies is just a true hard rock album with songs like ""No Excuses"" which will get you jumpin', ""Nutshell"" a classic tune from them, and ""Rotton Apple"" can't go wrong with this one. I'll tell you now, if you don't have this cd your missing out!"
5,Who keeps stealing this thing from me?,"I'm gonna kick your ass! Quit stealing my CD, motherf**ker! This is one of my favorites and if I catch you stealing my s**t again,I will kick your ass!"
5,Oh god yes.,"I was not a big fan of AiC until I heard No Excuses on the radio, back in the early 90's. This album is _masterful_. It's short, yes, but every song is of such a calibre that any music lover would be remiss not to pick it up. It's gorgeous."
5,I purchased this album and was amazed by the music.,"This is the most amazing album by any metal/grunge band ever. The music is amazing because it combined funk, blues, grunge, and violins into one amazing album. I can listen to this album for two hours, even if it is just a 30 minute EP. It includes two of Alice in Chains best albums, ""I Stay Away,"" and ""Don't Follow."" This album is a must for any true AIC fan!"
4,AIC's best album. They show great versatility with this alb,"AIC's album ""dirt"" use to be my favorite album of theirs. ""Dirt"" was a heavy and dark album. The songs made you want to peel yourself off the wall. ""Jars of flies"" is dark but it is not as heavy. The combination of an acoustical sound and the screach from Layne Staley, and the smooth voice of Cantrell they acomplish a sound unheard of before. The best song is ""Don't Follow,"" they employ a harmonica and it gives a feel you have never heard befoe."
5,An Album for a bad day,"Alice In Chains ""Jar Of Flies"" is my favorite AIC album ever, the reason why it's one of my favorites is that it's depressing *jus like all other AIC'S music* but it's more depressing, an album you want to listen to when you are having a bad day. With only having 7 songs it's still a great album, I Stay Away,Don't Follow,Nutshell,and Rotten Apple are my most favorite songs on the album, but Nutshell is the best song on the album, once you hear, it wont leave your head, and that pretty much goes for the other 6 six songs on the album. If you are looking for the heavy AIC like ""Would"", ""Them Bones"", ""Again"", you wont find it on here, but trust me, a little softer AIC is way better"
4,GOOD LAID BACK MUSIC,This album combines classic AIC with some great accustical melodies. My number 2 rated album behind dirt for AIC.Jar of FliesTry and COP THE ORIGINAL LIMITED EDITION with the plastic flies in the cd case spine!! A rare find. GOOD LUCK!
5,The best EP ever released.,"Everyone has heard ""No Excuses"" and ""I Stay Away"", and those two songs make this worth buying. But this more acoustic side of Alice In Chains is just as gripping as their heavier stuff. ""Rotten Apples"" and ""Nutshell"" are both haunting and catchy, and it is just a must-have album for fans of AIC and rock music in general. Plus, you can get it for pretty cheap, so there is no reason not to have it. I recommend this and all of their other albums."
4,Really nice acoustic EP,"Released after their very succesfull full length ""Dirt"", ""Jar of Flies"" is a seven song acoustic EP similar to their first EP ""Sap"". I must say that this is a surprisingly good effort since all of the songs on this EP are some of the best acoustic rock songs that Alice in Chains have ever composed. The guitars are very well processed and offer a beautiful layer on to which Layne Staley unfolds his vocal talents. The songs range from melancholic ballads like ""I Stay Away"" to more bluesy stuff like ""Swing on This"" and the amazing opener ""Rotten Apple"". They also use violin on one of their songs which is a very nice addition to their music. Since this is maybe the last worthy Alice in Chains album before their downfall I'd highly recommend this to fans of the band or fans of acoustic rock in the vein of Days of the New."
3,moody and druggy,"I guess I missed out on the heroin experience because with the exception of ""No Excuses"" it's too hard for me to like this AIC EP. Well ""I Stay Away"" is good too."
3,Not a 5-star album,"AiC fans: Stop fooling yourself. This is no 5-star album. ""Facelift"" & ""Dirt"" are classics, and worthy of high praise, but ""Jar of Flies"" fell flat. I love ""Nutshell"" and ""Rotten Apple"". I consider these to be up there with AiC's best. 2 songs don't make a record. The rest of the songs are average at best. And why an EP? If you need an ALICE IN CHAINS record, get FACELIFT & DIRT, and steer clear of J.O.F., and avoid the self titled record (3-legged dog)."
3,Jar of Sighs,"alright, i know everyone out there loves these guys and i have to agree that dirt was a mighty fine piece of hard rock. i bought this album expecting some of the same in your face somewhat talented riffing as their previous albums. but instead i was greeted by some of the most mediocre playing to come out of the grunge scene. what got me into AIC was cantrell's crushingly heavy riffs complimented by layne staley's indian influenced singing (the way he sings in fourths is really impressive and intriguing). but this one is more of a yawn fest. there's no energy, no power, there's not even a nice melody i can get into on an off day."
3,We want to be like Godsmack!,"I can't believe this band has a five-star album, yet the originators of this sound (Godsmack) doesn't! What is wrong with the reviewers of this site!? I guess some refuse to believe that their favorite band could be capable of ripping off another band (the superior and original Godsmack)! But I have facts to prove my statement!You say they didn't rip-off of metal legends Godsmack? Well, why do they have a song called ""God Smack"" ('Cleverly' spaced so that they wouldn't get sued)? I am so sick of cheap imiation bands like this. having bands doing this kind of stuff should be illegal. I bet none of you knew that Alice In Chains started out as nothing more than a Godsmack cover band, did you?!!"
1,I would swat 6 of these flies as,"They are no good. The first 6 songs are terrible. I know 2 hits came off of this: ""No Excuses"", and ""I Stay Away"", but they stink as well as ""Whales and Wasp"". It's a shame that they rushed this out after breaking through big time with ""Dirt"", but I guess the label knew best. The best on here is ""Swing On This"". This is another bad memory of my first few months in FL."
4,"Alice in Chains' Best, Jar of Flies near perfect, 4.5 stars","Jar of Flies is by far Alice in Chains' best album, after Jar of Flies was released, the band could no longer be considered a 'dumb metal band.' Jar of Flies shows their range and flexability and gives us some great songs like 'I Stay Away,' 'No Excuses,' and 'Don't Follow.' This album is one of the best released during the grunge period, this album gets 4.5 stars from me, and it's inches away from being a classic. If you call yourself an alternative fan and don't own this album, you're missing out on one of grunge's finest bands with their finest album."
4,wow!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"what band could release the gem that is dirt and then release this beauty. while not screaming heavy like facelift or dirt yet a tinge louder than sap, JOF is the fallout after the blast. gorgeous musical arrangements (on all AIC albums but shine most bright here) with layne's distinct voice paint a picture only AIC can. this was one band that realy hurt me when layne died. every album was brilliant up to this. they combine the quiet with the loud and show that you can be dark and heavy without the use of distortion or cranking the volume to eleven.heavy in his guitar playing, not his effects, jerry cantrell showed us the yellow brick road to great songwriting and guitar playing and the rest of the band demostrated how great greatness is when backed by extraordinary musicians."
5,This album is no rotten apple!,"This is my favorite of all Alice in Chain's albums. If you're a Chain's fan, there's no doubt that you'll enjoy this album! Enjoy!"
5,Excellent,Not one bad song on this entire album. You haven't heard Alice In Chains until you've listend to Jar Of Flies.
5,A.I.C's most moving CD,"I can't begin to think how well and thoughtfully recorded this album was. It seems like A.I.C. is getting better on each CD,from Facelift (their debut CD) to whatever their lattest album is. If you don't own it, and if you like acoustic sound or if you just like softer alternative rock, this is the one to buy!!!"
5,A COMET,Grab this masterpiece by any means necessary. A beautiful painting expressed in aching guitars and ethereal vocals. This album opens with two of the most beautiful songs i've ever heard and continues soulfully and swiftly torawds its inevitable demise. Much like Staley himself this litlle gem leaves you aching for more. (5)
4,Just short of a masterpiece,"After the dark and aggressive Dirt Jar of Flies was a change of pace for AIC. Although different it is just as good and if not for the fact that it is not a full album and the subpar ""Swing on This"" this would be a masterpiece, still it's damn great. This CD has always made me think of Dirt as AIC's ""heroin trip"" and Jar of Flies as the ""come down"". Sonically the sound is completely different as Jar of Flies is almost acoustic. It's mellow but extremley haunting like Nirvana's ""Unplugged"" CD. And just like that CD showed Nirvana's versatility this does the same for AIC. To be able to do songs like ""Them Bones"" and ""Junkhead"" on Dirt and then to be able to do a song like ""Don't Follow"" which is a polar opposite of those songs is simply amazing. Still gives me chills eleven years after hearing it for the first time. Sounds really good late at night when you just want to sit back and think."
5,Jar of Flies,"'Jar of Flies' is an Alice in Chains ep's and although short and sweet, it offers some truly great music. This shows a more chilled side to AIC and is all the better for it. You get the usual amazing guitar playing and vocals and some moving songs, `Nutshell` probably being one of the best AIC songs out there and 'Rotten Apples' is also a standout track. I tend to prefer `Jar of Flies' over other albums they've done and considering you can usually get this albums for a good price it works out as quite a bargain. Kick back, chill out and enjoy a slice of laid back AIC.Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page."
5,What a nice change!,"This release was a nice surprise, coming on the heels of the very-heavy ""Dirt"". The songs here are still excellent and they retain their intensity thru and thru. The beautiful acoustic playing on this album was really a revelation, and showed AIC to be a cut above the typical grunge/metal band of the time. The mood remains somber most of the time, but there are glimpses of positivity and optimism shining thru. The lyrics are trademark AIC, mostly of the depressing type. I find this to be a thought-provoking disc, full of texture and atmosphere. Check out the guitar work on ""Rotten Apple"" and ""Whale & Wasp"".Recommended."
5,'' Hands Are Bruised From Breaking Rocks All Day '',"This album is simply amazing. This is what i listen to after a long stressful day. this album is made up of seven great acoustic songs. Some of them are dark such as ''Nutshell'' and ''Rotten Apple"""", while others such as '' Don't Follow'' brings the light of the day. ''Whale & Wasp'' is a very heart warming solo insturmentle by Jerry Cantrell. i would truley reccomend this piece of art along with SAP."
4,jar of flies,"Great Alice in Chains album. Why ""Don't follow"" isnt on the greatest hits albums is beyond me. Layne Staley R.I.P"
5,Jar of Flies,This is a great album. One of the very best by Alice in Chains and Layne's singing is fabulous . Rotten Apple is Austin hear.
5,A landmark,"Seeing as how there are already over 200 mostly positive reviews of this landmark LP, adding more compliments seems almost needless...but hey, what the hell?AiC was never a band to just settle into a trend; from 1990's Facelift to 1995's self-titled album, AiC seamlessly went from arena rock to doom metal to soft acoustic to industrial alternative. AiC's studio albums have been proof that the best bands are those that don't ever stop trying to experiment with sounds and styles.While not technically an album, JoF is highly recommended...for anyone. One does not need to be an AiC fan to appreciate Cantrell's lush guitar work and Staley's distinctive croon."
5,Beautiful music,"Alice In Chains were renowned for being the heaviest and most morbid ""grunge"" outlet from Seattle in the 90's. But if you are expecting the standard ""grunge"" record, characterized by sludgy guitar work and heavy drumming, Jar of Flies will sorely displease you. What Jar of Flies IS is a collection of heartfelt, mostly acoustic numbers that tug at the heart and soothe the soul. Layne Staley's vocal performance on JoF is beautiful and haunting. Jerry Cantrell also shines here---just listen to that solo at the end of ""Rotten Apple"". Bottom line: Jar of Flies is a must in your music catalog. Buy it and enjoy."
5,Amazing Effort from AIC,"When I heard that Alice in Chains was going to release a EP, to follow up Dirt, I had no idea that such a short collection of songs would be an amazing powerful album. Yes, Jar of Flies is a bit mellow, yet I consider it to be their second best effort, falling just a little shy of ""Dirt."" I really feel for people who never got to experience this magical album. You can tell that every song comes straight from the heart, and as always, fans know that Alice in Chains hits a nerve. This one is a true classic, and I really encorage that if you are a fan, and don't have this one in your collection, then shame on you. ENJOY"
2,"Not Enough ""Hot Shots""","I was very disappointed in the coverage of the USAF role in Korea. This was the first time that jet battled jet in armed combat... and yet at least a third of the book centered on the P-51's role. F-84's were mentioned, but not one '84 pilot was included. And the final third of the book was focused on a pilot who was shot down and held captive 'til long after hostilities ended. It was a story of bravery and loneliness, but it wasn't the way to end the book and could have benefitted from a great deal of editing."
4,A good read,"This was a good compilation of personal accounts as reported by the author. Unfortunately, I found the accounts to be a bit too short to draw me in. The exception to this was the pilot describing his experience in a Chinese POW camp - this was fascinating and warranted a whole book in itself.The book went too quickly for me. It was a good, easy read but left me wanting more - and not in the same way that a good book should leave you wanting more. I guess I had hoped for more depth, a better feel for what it was like to be a fighter jock in the Korean War. Each account was just too abbreviated to develop the overall picture. I could have spent days talking to anyone of his sources yet instead I felt like we had a brief conversation in passing. Still, if you have a strong interest in this period, I wouldn't pass it up."
3,Fifty Years Ago,"The story tellers were very interesting. I happen to know two of them. My tour in Korea was 1955/1956 flying F-86 Sabres so I could relate to the situations these men faced in the air. I did not fire an unfriendly shot but we were prepared. The tactics and are battles described by the ""MIG Seekers"" were taught and drilled into us @ Nellis AFB and from every flying day there after. These men paved the way for all of the future jet fighter jocks. It is hard to beleive how unprepared we were for war and the hardships everyone in the field had to endure. KEEP'EM FLYING!"
5,Super Series,This is the third part of the Garrow's Law series (and unfortunately the last). Excellent throughout. Unique plots and historical settings.
5,Great,"Anyone would love Garrow, great period piece, Alun Armstrong is terrific, I hoping for a season 4, don't know if that will happen, if not its BBC's loss."
4,"Compelling story, lavishly detailed","Absorbing mix of fact and fiction, The Brotherhood of the Holy Shroud is a history lesson within a mystery. Julia Navarro's journalistic instincts are evident in this fascinating re-telling of the origin of the Holy Shroud of Turin. The story is so rich in detail, with historical characters so vividly portrayed, that the reader can forget these events happened centuries ago. Skillfully relating crimes in present-day Turin, Italy with the ancient storyline connects a scheme that deals with secret societies, hidden relics and ancient intrigue to resist the passage of time. This thriller should not be missed!"
2,The jejune ramblings of an adolescent,"Were I to guess, even knowing that the author is reportedly a respected journalist, I would guess her to be 16 years of age and possessed of a starry-eyed notion that she too could cash in on the Dan Brown phenomenon by writing a thriller using different material. The only problems with this strategy are: (a) Dan Brown is a very good Writer, (b) Julian Navarro is not a very good writer. Do yourself a favor: don't buy this book. It is unfocused, coughs up historical material that lacks any depth (I found most of the Armenian information online in about 5 minutes) or any degree of believability, and has all the elements of a romance novel though written by a young woman possessing few writing skills. No character in the book is drawn with any skill or depth, and no plot element has any degree of credibility. In short, this is a silly, useless book and its publishers should know better."
1,Blah.,"I don't care for this sort of ""thriller"" - and I'm quite glad that I didn't buy it. It was loaned to me by a virtual stranger, the one who claimed to have likedThe Swarm: A Novelas much as I did.As for this book, I did not enjoy it. I don't care for books resurrecting mysterious religious orders. All of the books in this sub-genre are formulaic and quite easy to figure out the ""mystery"" in the end. There are no grand revelations and the characters are rarely fleshed out enough to be even bother caring for. I certainly wouldn't recommend it, nor would I ever re-read it."
1,Why?,This book can be recommended to those who:1. seek witness of personal Faith2. have insomnia and are bored (not annoyed) by sectarian propaganda.Otherwise you can skip it.
1,Anti-semitic propaganda!,"Isn't it enough that Mel Gibson has to embarrass Christians all over the world with his blatant anti-semitic dribble; do we really need a book from Spain to do the same? The story is anti-semitic dogma from Opus Dei. The author clearly doesn't care about truth or who she hurts. Almost all of what she writes about Jesus was refuted in apologies to the Jewish peoples by two Popes. In addition, the story is quite boring. I urge Christians to save their money and spend it on good literture."
3,"Good, but Disappointing in the End","Overall, I enjoyed this book. At least until the end. The conclusion of this story was totally disappointing and anti-climatic. For a story written in such detail and intrigue, the lack of same at the end was a big letdown.If you enjoy ""christian"" / Templar related mysteries, you will probably like this book. Just don't expect much from the ending. Kind of a ""and that was it"" finish."
2,Pretty Bad,"I thought this book would be like the other goosebump series, but this has a horrible plot. I mean, she kills the cat over and over and then it wants to kll her. The ending is even worse. I suggest the old series of goosebumps books."
4,the best Rl Stine book i read yet...,"This story is about a girl name Allison who is drama in school. Well one morning she in a rush to get drama club on her bike. This cat runs out in the street & she doesn't mean to run him over. After that strange things start to happen like after she runs the cat over he gets up live, she latter learns the cats name is RIP. He keeps come after her, and changing her, and Rip never seems to die & wants his revengeI thought this is one of my favorite book I read so far by Stine. And I love the ending of this story wait to you read it. And ever chapter end exciting. I read this book less then one day I could not put it down. It's not super scary but it sure is entertaining & sort of funny."
1,Very scary.,I think this book is very scary because it gives me freaks and I do not recomended to children under 10.
1,Biased and Imperialistic,"This is an adventure tale fine! To say the least, Mr.Henty was biased and he was not properly informed of the time during which the novel was set.More than once, Henty describes that the British force was heaven sent to liberate the shackled kingdoms of India. However, he had forgotten that the British gained foothold in India by chicanery. I don't think in any of his succeeding novels, he brought to light the tyranny of the British in India. He was an imperialist to the core. (To quote Wikipedia, ""Henty was a strong supporter of the British Empire all his life. According to literary critic Kathryn Castle:'Henty... Exemplified the ethos of the new imperialism, and glorified in its success' "" )Tipu Sultan, was painted in such a poor light. Not to say he was the best of the individuals. At least, he wasn't fiendish as portrayed in the book."
5,Emotionally Beautiful,"I loved this book the whole way through. I felt as though I was a part of Paige's expiditions through the future of the Universe. I just cringe at the though of aliens invading the Earth and destroying it. I was so happy every time Paige was with Tem. I think that Pike could have told more about their relationship prior to when she left. I think It will be good for a sequal, too"
5,One of my favorites!,"I absolutely adore The Starlight Crystal. The book is great for science fiction lovers, as well as romancy-type people, because it tells the story of two people who loved each other so much, even though they were 200 years apart from each other. The book has a whacky storyline, which I love. It is one of my favorite Christopher Pike books ever! If you're a fan of his work, or other author such as R.L. Stine (yuck), you would really enjoy The Starlight Crystal."
3,Wasn't one of Pike's best,"I was disappointed about this book. It doesn't seemrealistic, and not very interesting"
3,What's with the science Fiction?,"Christopher Pike has been changing his writing style lately, and I'm not sure it's for the better. His recent books have been focusing on a sci-fi view and it's not what I want to read from him. Read his Final Friends or Remember Me series and then pick up this book. You'll be somewhat disappointed. I would have stopped reading this in the middle, but for some reason I wanted to see if it would get better. The last five pages redeemed Pike. It wasn't until this part of the book that I was able to relate this to myself and to society. I knew then that Pike had written from the heart. Those last few pages saved him from makin' this one a real stinker."
5,Young Sci-Fi,"I read this book years ago, shortly after it was released. This was my first taste of Science Fiction...I was instantly hooked! Thankx C. Pike!"
5,Very imaginative.,"I really enjoyed this book the first time I read it in middle school. I was a very big christopher pike fan back then. i liked the way the plot progressed and became so complex and intricate. and the way it works itself out it reminds me of the terminator movies in a way. one action changes the course of history kind of thing. it just shows the imagination this author has. although I think he may have run out of ideas for ""the hollow skull"". I think ""the starlight crystal"" was one of his best works. If you liked this novel, try some of his other books like ""The Last Vampire"" series. That was good too. If you didn't like ""the starlight crystal"" chances are that either 1) you're not a fan of sci-fi or 2) you have no imagination. That's just my opinion."
3,"Cheesy, based on a faulty scienfic premise, but okay","The best thing about this book is definitely the plot - Christopher Pike does a wonderful job of weaving a complex story. However, some of the physics in this book were inaccurate - in the middle, it seems Paige witnesses ""the Big Crunch"" from some faraway vantage point. Not only is the Big Crunch unlikely to happen, it would be impossible to escape it. Also, it's unlikely that humanity will survive 200 years into the future - our resources are likely to be gone by 2050.Another problem I had with this book was it was just cheesy - ""love conquers all"" and ""we are all one with everything"" are overused themes. And love at first sight? Can we please save that for fairy tales and trashy romance novels?"
5,a truly wonderful book!,one of pike's best! it is about a girl goes on mission that lasts 200 years but over that preiod of time she only ages one year. she loses almost all the people she loves. a great book. YOU MUST READ IT!!!!
3,Wine Cooler,"This item arrived during the estimated time. I was a bit disappointed because the cooler is slimmer than I thought it would be. Other than that, I am pleased."
4,It works,I was initially a little dubious that this wine cooler would actually work. It not only works well but is attractive on the table and certainly keeps a bottle of wine at the proper temperature throughout the meal
3,Good review of the violence of nationalism,"It is important to get behind the tactics and into the motives of a nationalist organization. The ""terrorism"" of the Irgun and Lehi factions in pre-Israel Palestine is well-summarized here, although he does downplay the savagery of the violence. Still, the people behind the violence have stories and motivations worth exploring. Ultimately, one must realize that the groups made a cult of violence, but that its members did so for reasons they regarded as self-sacrificing and patriotic. Established states are instruments of terrorism so it should be no surprise that those who aspired to create one would be capable of ruthless violence."
2,Great Product; Greedy Vendor,"This halter is an excellent item. Unfortunately, Simply Pets is gouging the customer on price. Note the different prices and you will see most of them are two thirds the cost for the SAME DEVICE!!"
3,I agree,"The gymnastics was HIGHLY unbelievable but of course being a gymnast, I must have rented it a billion times back in high school (can it be 20 years ago??). And of course, the fact that ""newcomer"" (this was pre-Bill & Ted, etc.) Keanu Reeves was in it.I think she did something like 7 tumbling passes in her floor exercise. Yeah, right! Can we say ""technical advisor""?? But still a nostalgic choice."
2,"""Dream to Believe"" what??","""Dream to Believe"" is a rather unrealistic movie about a female gymnast, Robin Cook (have heard that name before), who succeeds in making the 2-member team for some never-heard-of gymnastics meet in some high school gymnasium. And needing a 9.900 on her last event, floor exercise, after poor performances on bars and beam (where's the vault??) to tie with her fiendish teammate, she chalks up a perfect 10 (surprise, surprise!) The only reason to watch this movie -- a gymnastics fan or a fan of Keanu Reeves."
3,I don't get it.,I was so disappointed that almost half the pictures looked like something I might have taken and the others looked professional...I thought the calander defective or inadequately edited and he said it was just an artistic style; blue and blurry and that M is so on top of every area of his industry that he wouldn't allow anything less than exactly what he wants to be published. I'm not saying I have to like every one; lots of things I don't care for I can appreciate their quality.I'm not an art expert; acually I think these popular calendars are marketed for us regular folks. They used to say that ...
1,Didn't work for me,"I have a VW Beetle convertible. The black dash was looking shabby from, I suppose, too much Florida sun. I had used Armorall way back when (way before Florida) with good results on tires, interiors, etc.I thought this is what I was purchasing. Wrong! I guess ArmorAll and Meguiars are two completely different products. In short, I wound up with a smeary mess on my very wide and very noticeable dash.Someone at the VW dealership recommended Turtle Wax F21.Presto! Worked great and was only $3.99."
2,Better is Out There,"I won't bother to make this a long review and will just get to the point. The product is okay but definitely not the best at all. If you ask me, Windex would have done a better job. It didn't leave a shine like I though it would."
1,Its like spraying water on your dash,"completely useless product. i can't believe i waste my money buying this. i am really looking into returing this item. i sprayed it on the dash and on the doors when i got it and nothing happen, it doesnt shine anything, it does not even protect the surface like it claims it can do. im very disappointed."
2,No real cleaning power,"Meguiar's Quik is cheap, which is great as long as your interior is already pretty clean. It has no intrinsic cleaning power of it's own beyond that of water. In other words, it will clean exactly as well as a damp cloth. Any dirt that can't be lifted with a damp cloth will stay put. It does have a nice scent, which dissipates in a matter of hours. You'll probably want a more effective product if your car gets a lot of use and/or carries many passengers."
4,Does what I expected (but only just),"The other reviews are right - this really doesn't do much. I bought it to wipe off the wood grain/navi screen of a new car, and it does do that, but it doesn't add anything, only removes the fingerprints.Thats the bulk of what I wanted it for, but I kinda feel water could have done the same thing... oh well, maybe it blocks UV rays or something."
2,Did i get a bad batch?,"I tried this out based on reviews and couldn't have been less pleased. The stuff does not smell good at all. It actually made me about choke it was so strong (and this was with the doors open while spraying). Doesnt seem like it does much of anything to be honest. I feel like when i'm done, my rag is soaked but there is no protectant on my dash. I like everything else i've tried from meguiars, but not this stuff."
5,Will buy again,First time I have used this product and was pleasantly surprised. Meguiars products are top notch. Worth every penny. Will buy again
3,"Good to protect, not to clean","If you want the leather in your car to be refreshed or if your car is new, try this one. But if you are trying to clean your leather seats, you'll be disappointed. The leather cleaner that zymol makes is way better. Ok product."
3,Smells great. So so cleaning.,"I used [[ASIN:B000AMLWH8 Meguiar's Quik Interior Detailer Cleaner, 16.oz] on two cars.ProsMild non-offending fragrance gives a fresh smellIt is a good cleaner at its price pointConsDoes not remove makeup stains around vanity mirrorsDoes not remove grime ""cooked"" on vinyl dashboardDoes not clean much--too mild perhapsThe bottom line is if you are going to spend time cleaning your car, get a cleaner that actually cleans. I used [[ASIN:B002L2EI1C Griot's Garage 11104 Interior Cleaner - 35 oz.]] with thisGriot's Garage 11022 Finest Sprayera week after and it cleaned grime that this quick detailer perfumed. If you have leather seats then instead getGriot's Garage 11259 Leather Care Spray Kit."
5,It does smell...,"It does smell a little weird. But that's temporary. Does a good job cleaning the interior of the car. VERY good job. I just bought a used Acura and the previous owner's cigarette smoke is long gone with a quick clean with the Meguiar's.Like another reviewer expressed, no weird shine. I appreciate that actually. No glare from the sun bouncing off the dash. Safety first kids."
2,New version is not so nice.,I always buy this stuff for cleaning the interior of my car. I saw the listing on Amazon and decided to order from here since I had a gift card. When I received the product I noticed the bottle was different and definitely not the same quality of the old bottle. Instead of the nice mist that the old design gave this one does the mist plus the big drops of spray that most cheap spray bottles give. Also the new formula has the same basic smell but it is a lot stronger and definitely more of a chemical smell in a bad way. I do not like this new formula!
4,It is worth the price,A very good commentary on Exodus. Has good spiritual insight with some practicality. I would order again. I recommend. Not too technical. I would hardly give anything 5 stars.
5,my favourite zane grey book,"I have read this book the first time as a teenager and have re-read it many times since then. I love the descriptions of the nature, the mountains, the desert, the horses etc.. I also found the story very captivating. the book came out later as ""duane of the mountains"" with basically just the name of Milt Dale changed. Milt, the male hero of the book, is not a gun-slinging cowboy, but a man who loves the solitude of the mountains, a life in the woods, shared only with his pets, a tame mountain lion and various other animals. When he meets Helen Rayner and her sister Bo, his whole life changes, and it takes him a while to understand what is going on in himself. I will certainly read it again, and I can recommend it to anybody who does not look for a western full of brutality. (well, there is some shooting and some people are killed, but it is described in a non-drastic way and it is just a necessary part of the story)."
3,Man of the Forest,"Zane Grey's novels can practically be considered classics today. Present day readers may find his stories and often his opinions dated, but they do give one a true sense of what the American West must have been like in the late 1800's early 1900's. This book tells about life in the forest and what those people did to survive and flourish."
2,disappointed!,"This book began well-I appreciated the beautifully descriptive language used in regards to the scenery. The characters were interesting and seemed ver likable as well. However one major flaw, probably due in part to the time period it was written in and the historical era referred to, it had very blatant racial stereoptypes. These included rude and racists labels, as well as stereotypes. Most of the villans were mexican, while all the heros seemed to be caucasian. I found this to be highly offensive, although not being of that race myself, and in particular the derogatory names used, and the discriptors as well, especially towards the end of the book. While it was not the main message of the book, it was a strong idea that ran throughout it."
2,Not into this book.,Just not capturing my attention at all. I will move on to the next book & leave this for someone who might really enjoy it.
4,Official Release!!!!!!,"Finally, I can buy the DVD of Idiot's Delight. Having seen clips of it for years -- I wanted to own a little bit of movie history -- Clark Gable singing & dancing. Download it if you want but I'll stick with having the good ole DVD in my hands...."
3,Not bad but...,"First, the play, the works, the style is terribly outdated. There are movies that only gets better because of it. This is not one of them. Irene is a caricature of a Russian whether she wears a mask of a rich or a simple woman. So much that it's not even funny, just annoying. Still, if you like movies like ""White Christmas"" you may like this one too.Oh, and ""Puttin' on the Ritz"", that's what make this movie to stay in history. I actually got to it after hearing ""Puttin' on the Ritz"" in ""Jeeves and Wooster"" - btw, highly recommend this one."
5,"So what if it's""stagey""","it's still a memorable movie with great lead perfomances. Maybe I should feel guilty but I found it a fun film despite its dark message and, the setting was perfect. BTW, I just finished reading the play and it is very close to the movie - the big difference being the play starts at the Hotel Monte Gabriele with no other preamble."
3,"Really pretty setting, but fragile stone.","I really loved this ring. It was gorgeous, but the tanzanite stone came chipped/scratched (I tried returning it to get it fixed, but it came back in the same condition, so I gave up) and later cracked completely in half. :( I don't wear it anymore, because the stone will likely fall out sooner or later...I'd really recommend this ring (because the setting is so pretty - and so was the tanzanite, before it broke), but only in a stone that's harder (do a wikipedia search for ""Mohs hardness"") than tanzanite is (sapphire or emerald or ruby or something)"
2,Was dissapointed too,Had to agree with other reviewers on the quality of current Thompson bibles. I compared my 15 year old thompson to a new version and I was disapointed. The leather cover was ok but the paper quality STINKS. The words of Christ are not as read as my old one and the paper is almost too thin and brittle. I dont know what happened but I guess they want to cut costs. I am going to buy an oxford bible insteasdkinda sad
3,Fascinating insight,This book was recommended. I didn't know Henry Miller painted at all! So actually I bought it out of curiosity! Very interesting stuff.
1,Not worth reading.,Hard to find a real story here. The story did not make sense. It was way out of whack! It had no plot.
5,Perfect for kids in grades 3-5,"Bobbie Kalman's 32-page country coverages are keys to any elementary-level library where reports are assigned for geography, and CANADA: THE PEOPLE and THE CULTURE are no exception. Covering Canadian myths, legends, holidays, cultural makeup and more, these pair bright, contemporary photos with facts perfect for geography study and perfect for kids in grades 3-5."
1,Absolute Garbage,I can't believe this stinker even made it to the Dollar Rental rack at my local grocery store. What a worthless piece of junk. I feel cheated paying a buck to rent it. Shame on the actors that demeaned themselves in the making of such a dog.
1,DUNDERHEAD INSTEAD,"Never has a usually reputable actor looked so uncomfortable and out of place as William Forsythe in this horrendous SciFi Channel movie called HAMMERHEAD. Forsythe, a really competent actor, plays an IT expert who becomes a Rambo-like hero, wet t-shirt and all. He is joined by Hunter Tylo, a marine biologist, who matches his Rambo shennanigans shot for shot, in this preposterous and ludicrous tale of genetic experimentation. Jeffrey Combs (REANIMATOR) is the mad scientist and its probably the worst I've seen him in his many films. The sharkman is never seen enough to judge the effects, but what one can see is pretty shoddy. The movie offers no suspense and is so jumbled, it's a real farce. Avoid if you can."
4,"hey, quit complaining","i don't have a newborn luv cub of my own. but i would just like to point out to those people who complain that it isn't doing everything what its supposed to do. the people who complain bought the WRONG TOY. they said it doesn't hug u back and it doesn't look exactly the same. well DUH. that's bcuz the one that hugs u back is the ORIGINAL LUV CUB which is more expensive. these are the NEWBORN LUV CUBS. so i think those people who complain about this type of thing should LOOK CAREFULLY AT THE NAME. these are the NEWBORN LUV CUBS. if u want the one that hugs u back and is more expensive, that's the LUV CUB with no NEWBORN in it."
4,"""Str8 Ballin'""","This album is the best CD that MC Eiht ever made in the rap game.I like the ""Def Wish III"". In it, he made some comments about DJ Quik stating that he was a ""clucka""- this would lead to a rivalry in which hurt MC Eiht's rep. Anyways the bests tracks are""All for the Money"" with that unforgetable beat, ""We Come Strapped"", and another great track ""Nothin' But the Gangsta"" f/ Redman and Spice 1. This track was excellent because between 1992-1996 Redman was doing some tight work on his and other people's albums. This is a very good album to pick up, especiallyif you're an MC Eiht fan, however to me, he never made good albums since the beef w/ Quik was laid to rest."
4,Great container,"I bought this for my father. There are a couple of different SPF towelettes on the market, but I purchased this one because the container would stand up to be tossed around my dad's truck, and the flip top would be easiest to close for even the most impatient of men. However, it took a long time to get to him. Amazon told me that it would, but I was still unhappy with the wait."
3,Novela de aventuras,"No es una aventura más de piratas, nos muestra costumbres y sociedad de la America Central joven atrapada entre los ánimos de escapar de la pobreza en Europa y sueños de conquista y riqueza."
3,The plot was slow moving and was not the action packed book I was anticipating,"It started slow and continued at the slow pace. I really could not get into the story. The characters were interesting, but did not pull me in"
3,I thought stuttering was gone....,"A good story ruined by the Kindle input. There were hyphenated words in nearly every paragraph. (Having nothing to do with a word beginning on one line and ending on another.) Thinking it might be due to my choice of font size or line spacing, I experimented with changing those. The changes did nothing... Reading the book on my kindle was like listening to a stutterer.The book itself is well written though the author spends a great deal of time on battle discriptions and tactics. I felt left up in the air by the ending. Many loose ends...a sequel in the works?"
4,Historical novel,I am currently reading this novel and am finding the history of the Caribbean islands very interesting. The descriptions of the scenery of Barbados and how the slave trade started there is very well written.
1,Didn't like it,"It is very depressing, if you like that kind of book you might like this one. I have deleted it already."
3,for more long lush not volum,well for my revelon is more cheaper and effective . I wont buy this again.
5,Excellent read.,I have read several of Bryson's books and this is my favorite. He somehow manages to combine great humor with a substantial history of science course.
4,It's not a textbook -- it's BETTER,"I listened to this book on tape. The more I listened, the more I knew I HAD to own a print copy. Then I found this Special Illustrated Edition and WOW! Am I glad I own it! This is the kind of book that's fun to read for all ages -- explaining some complex topics in easy-to-understand language. No, it's not a textbook nor a source for research. But it does its job of getting even the non-historian and non-scientist reading about something worthwhile."
5,Read'em up.,"I've read this book three times and listened once. Bryson is one of my favorites. This effort has resulted in the most interesting, fun, informative and memorable book I've ever had the pleasure of keeping by my bedside, on planes, on the sun porch, on the deck. Pick it up anywhere, open anywhere and you'll be smiling, laughing and in awe of the classy presentation."
5,You should read it!,"I'm interested in this kind of books, books about everything explained in few, plain and light words.My favorite author in this topics have been Carl Sagan, but now I think I found another source of wisdom.And the best of all, I enjoyed it.""Culture don't hurts"""
4,Technical made easy,"I read some other reviews about how Bryson makes some faulty claims and is not much of an authority on the subject. I can't say wheather this is true or not but I must say that he sounds convicing enough. Throughout the book, he admits his own inadequacies as a scientist and mathamatician What he has a gift for is turning technical data and history into a very readable narrative. This book is clearly not textbook type material. It is designed for the layman to better grasp some of the concepts of life, our universe, and history. If you read this book and find discrepancies with some of the data, then you are clearly not the target demographic. If you do want to learn more about this world we call our own, then check it out...You will not be disappointed."
4,Great boom,"Great book , quite sorprising. Ir tales Youtube to a ride you dont know where is going to? You wont be bored with this"
4,A book about the process of science,"This is a nice book which shows you the ups and downs of doing actual science. It's less about the science itself, though.One final note: the book is not very rigorous but very fun. Very recommendable nonetheless."
5,The best book ever,"The other reviewers have pretty much said it all. I just wish there were books like this when I was a young kid (or even when I was in college). Bryson is an amazing writer. He touches on all of the major areas of science and science history, but the star of this book is not the subject matter, it's the manner in which the story is told. Impossible to put down, this book will grip you and hold you from start to finish. I stopped reading it 50 pages from the end because I did not want it to end (that abstinence lasted all of two days). I've read some excellent books in my 39 years, but this is, without question, the best book of any type that I've ever read. Absolutely phenomenal."
3,An Informative But Dry History of Nearly Everything,"I'm big fan of Bryson's A Walk In the Woods and was expecting a quirky, humorous take on the history of life and science as we know it. I was disappointed to find a dry, monotone reading by the author. He does a good job of weaving the fascinating and complex stories of discovery together but you really feel the minutes and hours tick by and it plods on chapter after chapter. I suppose it was more entertaining than listening to someone read ""A Brief History of Time"" - but not by much. Listen if you want to learn, not if you want to laugh."
3,"Entertaining, but simple","In excess of 500 pages, Bryson communicates the bare bones of the topics he seeks to describe. His book reflects his limited understanding of any of the topics included, and is far too simple to be considered true ""science writing"".Entertaining, yet evasive, Bryson beats around the bush focusing more on the lives and ideosyncrasies of individuals more than their actual contributions to the science he is addressing.If you're looking for light reading perhaps this book is the correct choice... the fact that i didn't make it past the 400 page mark speaks for itself for readers like me"
3,Science Gossip Galore,"This book is not about science, but science gossip. As a purveyor of gossip it does a marvelous job. It tells you more than you ever want to know about the background of some discoveries and the human side of some of the big names in science and technology.Bryson sourced his materials from an impressive array of books and other publications and weaved them into a readable, almost connected, set of essays. As we all know, just because something appears in print does not mean it is true, and just because something is true does not mean it is the whole story, much less an objective one. I don't know how much of the material has been independently confirmed.Unlike most other books of this genre, which focus on informing the lay reader on the science and the scientists, and add some gossip to liven things up, this book is full of gossip and has scant retainable information.It is not a bad book to kill time on a plane and be entertained; it is just not particularly useful."
5,Breathtaking!,"Page after page I was captivated by the heady mixture of science, and descriptions of scientists with their real life breakthroughs and frustrations, with some dishonest competition thrown in for good measure. I was enthralled from the first page to the last, and was sorry when I finished the book.I read in parallel another bookThe Geology of Australiawhich covered some of the same material with arresting clarity. I particularly liked the sections on glaciers, which help explain some large boulder emplacements near Heathcote in Victoria, Australia."
3,Deep,"Very interesting reading. Covers the subjects very well. Not a fast read, but enjoyable - possibly not for everyone. Worth recommending, though"
5,Can't get enough,I have read this book at least four times. I can't get enough of it. Bryson is such a good storyteller that he makes learning fun. With each read I remember and learn more.
3,whites only?,"This book is a pleasure to read, and contains many plausible explanations for why many things appear the way they do, but, acording to Mr Bryson's account, all science is the product of a handful of thoughtful Western Europeans and North Americans. This makes science appear more like a localized religion than like objective truth, which, as I understand it, it claims to be.Peter O'KeefeSt.BarthélemyFrench West Indies"
1,not hold back by lack of any knowledge,Bryson has written a book on the historical development of science that reads as easily as a crime story. However it is too obvious that the author has not any knowledge of physics. A comic work for physicist. For all others: don't take it too serious.
1,Not what it ought to be,"An interesting read in places, but he badly mucks up genetics and flatout ignores quantum physics - two of the most fascinating developments of 20th Century science. Read anything by Laurence Krauss or Richard Dawkins instead."
2,Not the most fun book.,"I am a big fan of Mr. Bryson. But I found this book to be tedious. His travel books are wonderful because of his insight, warmth, charm, wit, and irritability. But this feels like a book that he wrote based on books he's read. It doesn't really play into his strong suit - his ability to articulate his personal experience. I guess I just don't see what this book offered that I couldn't get elsewhere."
2,Science History without any Science,"A facinating topic but written by someone that clearly does not understand the science. So you get lots of somewhat dubious anecdotes about the quirky lives of the scientists but no feeling for the science itself.For example the discussion of Newton ""discovering gravity"" does not even briefly mentioning what he did (with the moon) and thus what it was that he actually discovered. There are also many many errors and misunderstandings.No doubt the book will sell and people that have no idea of science might like it. Bryson writes well about topics such as travel and popular history because he understands them."
5,love this book,"bill bryson is funny and informative, has a unique ability to maintain interest in even the strangest of topics. really really enjoy this book"
4,Games Show Prep,"I bought ""A Short History of Nearly Everything"" because of the recommendations by people who bought ""My Fractured Life"" by Rikki Lee Travolta. I really ended up enjoying it. It's a different kind of book. It's kind of science, history, and everything academic put in terms that John Doe Americana can understand. I guess I liked it because if felt like a prep course for the ""My Fractured Life"" chapter on the game show ""Jeopardy."" Hey, if Bill Bryson can make me understand science and history and actually make it interesting, it's got be good, right? Give it a try."
5,VERY readable,"The problem with most books of this sort is their dryness. Ever try to get through a Stephen Hawking book? Then you know what I mean. Bryson is witty and engaging and links together discoveries over the ages that have led us to where we are today. Great reading and very illuminating - makes me want to learn more!This one is a keeper. I usually read and relist and sell here, but this one I'm keeping for future reference!"
5,Amazing,"This book was amazing! it was easy to read, i ended up putting it down several times and coming back later. This book is full of mind-boggling facts about, well everything. i would reccommend this book to anyone who has ever been in awe of nature or of the human body or the solar system...serioiusly, this book covers it all."
4,excellent and humourous,"Bryson is brilliant in his ability to convey information to the reader. A great read. This book is entertaining, humourous, and informative.wwr@virginia.edu"
4,Enjoyable,"An enjoyable and informative book by an entertaining writer who knows his craft. Not tremendously profound, but a fun read, and we need a bit of fun at the moment. I hope Bryson keeps turning them out."
4,Layperson's View of Universe,"This is an eye-opener for the layperson not shooled in cosmology, astronomy and particle physics. By using helpful analogies, the author unlocks much recent research in these areas for lay appreciation. However, in the latter part of the book, he bogs down in detail. All in all, though, it's a worthwhile read."
5,Must have book,"This is a fascinating book that I recommend to everyone since I read it. This book was a great refresher for things I learned and forgot and also the things I never learned. I give full credit to the author for simplifying and making entertaining so many otherwise complex and uninteresting concepts. The whole idea of this book is so unique and execution of it is impeccable. After reading each chapter you feel like you know so much more about this beautiful planet and our existence on it. Whether you like science or not, this book is a must read."
5,a short history of nearly everything,A really good read presenting the science with humor and in words the non-scientist can understand.Pointing out how little we know about everything and how recently it is that we know what we do.And how reluctant we have been to accept new thoughts and knowledge.
2,Bill Bryson does not achieve his goal of understanding.,"On the fourth page, Bryson admits this book is not really a short history of nearly everything. And it isn't. For the subject matter it actually explains, It is a verbose account of scientists' idiosyncrasies. Explanations of phenomena are rare. Until page 37 and 38's six meaningful paragraphs, Bryson chooses to only explore trivial matters, like how Newton stared into the sun or inserted into his face a sewing needle. If you like trivial facts like this, this book is for you. If you like actual scientific concepts and meanings, but find it troublesome to follow the extensive mathematics, I'd recommend theoretical physicist Stephen Hawking or neuroscientist Sam Harris or chemist Cathy Cobb... If you like the history of the attempts to achieve some answers, but not the answers themselves, this book is okay. At least Bryson's heart is approximately in the right place."
5,And I thought I new about science,"Read this book and read it now. This book is humbling indeed. So you think you are the master of the planet? That we have been doing a good job in getting here and in staying here. Well, you might be in for a surprise or two. Bacteria could just outfox us. And the luck we used in order to get here, on the planet. Just extraordinary. I will have to re-listen to this one - I have the Audio Book version."
5,"Remarkable, great for the non-science guy",My field is more in history and social studies but have always been interested in the natural world. A lack of mathmatical/cientific thinking prevented me from really knowing more than I could. This book however filled that gap and it is such a fun book to read. Clear but concise the natural events are linked to the people who came up with it. More books should be written this way.
5,A Short History of Nearly Everything,"I am 53 years old, I have studied geology and physics in the past but a lot has been discovered since my education. It was both fascinating and educational for me to discover how much more is known (and how much can not be understood) about the history of the earth and the development of life. This book, A Short History of Nearly Everything, is one of the best books I have ever read. Bill Bryson writes well. Bill can explain difficult concepts humorously and he also makes it easy for the reader to understand the concepts."
4,Iffy science but great for students,"I'm a biology professor at a small Appalachian college, and I very much enjoyed this book. Yes, some of the science gets a bit glossed over--but there are many excellent books by Gould, Hawkins, Diamond, Thomas, Mayr, and others that explore various scientific topics in more detail. The strength of this book lies in its approachability to the reader with little or no science background. I am constantly confronted with students who are convinced that science is boring--a dangerous mindset in this day and age. However, a few of them actually changed their minds after reading selected chapters from Bryson's book. At their level it is only important to get them engaged--minor factual errors can be corrected later.And personally, even though I've read a lot of the primary and secondary literature in science, I thought this book was a lot of fun."
3,Better be a horse than a goose,"Bill Bryson is a great writer no doubt, but then again in writing this book he reminds us of the story between the goose and the horse, were the goose makes fun of the horse that it is not as gracefull as her, for the goose can walk on the ground fly in the air and swim in the sea. the response being, I may not have these many ability's as you have, but look how well my limbs are placed, look how strong my body is tuned and how marvelous it is shaped, and when I run I am as fast as the wind, while you, when you walk on the ground you walk in a clumsy manner, amd when you fly you are no match to the eagle or the swift, and when you swim you do not match a fish or a penguin. Yes i may not have the abilities that you have but I would much rather be a horse in one than a goose in all. I personally think that Mr bill should stick and learn more about one topic and be a horse instead of being a goose and turning his readers into a geese in all subjects."
2,One the worst books I'v ever read,"I've been reading science books since I was seven years old. This is not only one of the worst science books I've ever read but one of the worst books period. The author presents contradictory facts and figures. The book is poorly edited. Worst of all, he ends each topic with a message of fear and uncertainty. If we let each of his little fear factors into our brains we would live our lives in fear of the very improbable. Examples include, asteroids, hurricanes, earthquakes, volcanoes, disease . . . Life and existence involve risk but to focus on risk is misleading and unhealthy."
1,Information needs to be verified,"This book is well written and presents some interesting information. But I noticed a few errors in the Physics and Astronomy section. Then I read the review for ""Mother Tongue"" and saw that this author has made a habit of making erroneous statements. This has made me question all the information in disciplines where I have no experience."
1,This Is Bill Bryson??,"This was dreadful. After reading some of Bryson's earlier books, I assumed that this would be a good read, as well. Midway through the first chapter, I was asleep, presumably because it had nearly bored me to death and I had to go into a life-saving stasis to prevent any further brain damage."
1,A Short History of Nothing At All,"Amazing! A typical C-student's last-minute make-up paper!Knowing nothing but pretending to know everything. I love you.The right sub-title must be one of the followings:1, For pre-school kids;2, For high-school drop-out;3, For those who know English only but absolutely nothing elseI believe Amazon should have negative rating!"
5,Best book ever written,"Bill Bryson's best work. If you aren't taken by the Introduction, you won't like the rest of the book... but if the Introduction speaks to you -- buckle up! I've turned down about half of the pages because of some funny, interesting, amazing tidbit I want to remember. Who knew that science could be so interesting and so entertaining! Bryson's dry humor is just right to bring what could be dense, complex information to vivid life. I will admit -- the knowledge I gained from this book caused a complete spiritual upheaval with me -- it really puts things (i.e., us) in perspective. This is my new FAVORITE BOOK, and I've given away many copies. A winner!!!"
5,As Good as It Gets,"As a scientist (Ph.D., Chemistry) I am continually amazed at the general public's (including high government officials) seemingly complete ignorance and lack of interest in nature and the science of the world around us. This includes hot contemporary topics like global warming, intelligent design, and environmental concerns as well as more esoteric subjects such as the age of the universe, the weight of the earth, and the distance to the nearest stars.Bill Bryson's ""A Short History of Nearly Everything"" is a tour-de-force of science writing covering these (and many more) subjects (check the title) in a style that is breezy, absorbing, and chock full of good science. But don't let the good science part put you off. The story is told through the personalities, exploits, and sometimes misadventures, of many of the greatest minds of the last four hundred years. It is funny, informative, and a perfect addition to your summer reading list for the beach."
5,Short History Of Everything,"One of the best armchair books on science ever. The author is very fair, setting the record straight wherever he can by giving credit to the smalltime guy where credit is due. Bryson explains things (in this case, science) in a way that is meaningful to everyone. I agree with a previous review I read that says the only other book that accomplishes the same is Remick's ""West Point: Character, Leadership, Education, Thomas Jefferson"" in which the history-philosophy behind America-West Point (therefore, no way in conflict with Mr. Bryson's book about science) is explained in a way that's for everyone. Mr. Bryson's book is a fascinating and exciting journey through the history of science. If you take the trip, you'll both enjoy it and have a short education on nearly everything. I highly recommend it. You might also want to read Remick's book after you read Bryson's ""A Short History of Nearly Everything"" to have a ""short history of everything""."
3,Great book -- so so illustrations,"As you can see from all of the other reviews -- the book is infintely readable, and extremely interesting.The illustrations, however, add little, if anything to the text. all they do add is bulk to the book. It is very heavy and hard to read in bed. Go with the original."
2,"Simplistic, but yet entertaining","I enjoyed the humor in the writing and the logical thread. Written at the novice level, it may be a good book for those not ready for the James Burke's Connections series. However, it is obviously documenting the process of discovering science by someone who has a high school exposure to science. This may be the main value of a Short History-- making science palatable. For those who are educated scientists and read about science, this book disappoints because of the lack of any new synthesis or perspective."
2,Book Report on Popular Science,"For me, this book was very disappointing. Rather than being a well-thought out book on science, it turned out to be a book report on the best-selling science books of the last twenty years. If one looks at the bibliography and the notes at the end, it becomes obvious that Bill Bryson gets most of his information from sources aimed at the general reader. I think one would be much better off reading the books in the bibliography that go into each subject in-depth and are written by specialists rather than getting this summary version.Bryson also seems to have a fixation with all the ways nature can destroy our civilization."
4,A Short History is great for non-fiction reading samples!,"I'm not yet done with the book, but I love the style of the writing. Bryson keeps the wonder and humor of the physical sciences which is sorely lacking in academic textbooks. I originally checked it out of the library, but I had to buy my own copy so that I could mark all of the places that would be great to use for interesting and provoking selections for my eighth grade English classroom. If you teach chemistry, physics, or reading to middle school or high school students,I strongly recommend this book for the short episodes which are easy to pull out for quick supplemental reading. My eighth graders loved the passage where the German scientist tried to turn human urine into gold and accidentally discovered phosphorous--priceless!"
4,Overall a good read,"This book is a good read for the generalist interested in the history of natural science.Bryson goes from astronomy to paleontology to anthropology. One of the constants in the book is how little we actually know about everything around us.Some of the other reviewers have taken Bryson to task for missing on the science, and I won't argue with them. At the same time, the broad strokes are close enough for most readers.The cover of my copy of the book (with a screw, washer, and bolt) was misleading to me. I thought there would be something about engineering, but there was not.Probably the best part to me was how scientific accomplishment is often the result of luck or completely ignored. It's really kind of scary. Overall, a good read."
4,Nearly everything indeed,"A nice Bryson, who has a nice life. Interesting how that happens....he visits England, meets his wife, stays forever, writes for newspapers, sells one book and hits just the right note. He has a nice voice, though his earlier stuff was funnier. Now he's a name, and will continue to sell unless he becomes addled by disease and begins to write dreck.The most amazing thing about this book is that he, or anyone, could find out such amazing stuff about the nature, complexity, order and magnificence of the universe and still not believe in God, the designer"
5,a question,"A SHORT HISTORY OF NEARLY EVERYTHING has been a memorable read for me -- both times through it. Both times, I was left with the question of how it could be that no mention was made of Immanuel Velikovski's work - ?"
5,great,"I bought this book for my husband for Christmas last year and he loved it, great information about nothing in particular"
5,Fantastic Book,"My husband loves this book, there are facts about everything, so we bought it as a Christmas present for a friend."
3,Interesting history of science,"Bryson has a great facility for describing personalities and oddities of their lives. He makes them very human. Even Einstein, it turns out, was very uncomfortable with quantum mechanics and ""wasted half his life looking for a general theory of everything."" Cavendish was a people phobe, and one ""scientist"" would have done the world better to avoid science altogether (the guy who created tetra-ethyl lead and CFCs). He also points out how many of the greatest discoveries were made by people we know little about.While we currently ponder questions like What is gravity, and How big is the Universe, back in the early 1800s, great minds were determining the weight of the earth, creating the periodic table, and discovering the history and age of the earth. Interesting stuff."
3,Clever approach to science,"Having a degree in the natural sciences, I must admit that I slogged through the first 170 pages of atoms, molecules and quantum physics simply because I have no interest in chemistry, the unseen, the theoretical or hypothetical, however, the remainder of the book was replete with amazing chapters.Bryson's line of attack to explain nearly every scientific tidbit from time immemorial is a commonsensical way for all to understand.Take for instance chapters on geology and continental drift, the rise of life, small world, life goes on, Darwinism and the finale with human evolution. Bryson is quite dexterous in presenting his subject.There is an abundance to learn especially with this twist of writing.My only misgiving, besides the first 170 pages, was the overall length."
5,It's the bomb!,"Highly recommended. Whether intentionally or not, Bryson manages to persuasively fit Creationism and Evolutionary theory together in this engaging exploration of the sciences. Fast, entertaining reading that is serious enough to be credible but weaves humorous anecdotes in to lighten the load. From space to geology to zoology to paleontology and more -- great gift book for science-minded.You'll find this very empowering information. Dispels alot of the current mythology imbedded in traditional theories and gives you a good idea of how very little we actually know."
5,Bryson Does It Again,"We are used to Bill Bryson's humorous look at life and sprinkling of facts that provide insight. This book tops them all. The scope is breathtaking -- from the smallest particle in the universe to the infinite cosmos -- and he makes it all fit. A page turner. Most of all, he gives insights into the icons of the scientific world -- all with the same chuckling, compassionate touch that Bryson readers expect. This is a must read. And, it's a book that you can give as a gift to the young and the young-at-heart that remain curious about the universe that surrounds them."
4,Good,"Good book in typical Bryson fashion, but a little heavy on the biographical information. You'll learn a lot about the sciences and the like, but even more (too much) about the men who did the work. But the book is interesting and not full of trivia style information, though it isnt' exactly a ""layman's guide to science."""
3,Depends on what you like in a science book,"There's a lot to like in this book. As indicated in the title, it covers a very wide range of topics. Bryson also has a droll style that helps make the book entertaining. For me, it was hampered by the amount of gossip about the personalities involved in science, as well as the breathless wonder about how big, far, fast, or numerous something is. It seemed like it cheapened it and made it a little childish. But I'm a data guy...just give me the facts in a readable style and I'm happy. I'll figure out if I should be impressed by the size of the universe. However, if you like learning about the idiosyncrasies of the science celebrities and enjoy the ardent enthusiasm, then I would recommend this book."
5,Terrific!,"This was a fantastic book. Mr. Bryson has an inquiring mind, and the ability to dig deep into scientific subject matters, yet make them accessible to a lay person. I'm really looking forward to buying the Really Short History to read to my kids. Fascinating stuff! More please!"
2,Not Easy Reading,"Thought this book was going to be a bit easier to read. I don't recommend this book to someone who is looking for some easy reading on ""A Short History of Nearly Everything"". The layout is way to tight and you cannot find info on any particular subject easily. Sorry Mr. Bryson.....I guess it's just not for me or the Father's in my life. I had bought 4 of them for Father's Day gifts and had to return all of them."
1,"Dull, Dull, Dull....!","I have read most of Bill Bryson's books; in fact, I'm a major fan. Usually, he makes me laugh and teaches me fascinating facts I am happy to acquire. (However, he does seem sometimes to try too hard to be witty -- wit is wonderful if it doesn't seem strained.) I never thought he could write a DULL book...I was wrong. I bought this as an audio book from Audible.com, and I could get through only a couple of chapters. All the arcane data about the universe, our solar system, and the earth itself, not to mention the personal and political proclivities, idiosyncrasies, and conflicts of scientists and mathematicians -- while doubtless engrossing for a scientist or mathematician -- was deadly dull to ME. Of course, I am an English prof, and advanced science and math have ever been enigmatic to me. Sorry, Bill . . . this is just NOT my cup of literature."
1,Extremely Disappointing,"This book is a waste of time and money. It's more of a gossip column, not a study of science by any means. Maybe 10% is science and the rest is gossipy trivia with a definite negative bent.Mr. Bryson's ""humor"" is nothing but sarcastic wise-a** glibness. It takes him a paragraph to state a simple fact, with all his ""humor."""
5,Steep but worth the effort,I am not a scientist but I have enjoyed reading this book. I 'get' about 40% of the tough chapters but that 40% is mind stretching-and mind boggling. I highly recommend you make the effort too-you will never look at the universe nor contemplate the nature of time in quite the same way again.
4,Don't Let the Science Experts Deter You From Reading this Book,"After three years of research, Bryson, who admits that he hardly knew anything about science, gives an overview of the history of scientific discovery, from the origins of the cosmos to the ascent of humans. He explains the concepts, theories, and experiments in terms that a generally educated reader can understand, and introduces readers to the personalities (and egos) as well as the science. The significance of this book is not in the details (which only the experts will really notice) but in the grand narrative he gives of the development of scientific disciplines. He gives you hooks on which to hang your intellectual hat. This book will make non-scientists want to read more about science."
4,I didn't think I would finish this book,"A co-worker passed this book to me. I didn't think I would like it as I barely got through high school science. I was also afraid this would be like Hawking's ""A Brief History of Time;"" that is, nearly unreadable. I read this because I've liked Bryson's other stuff. I read the whole thing saying ""OK, in another 20 pages or so I'll stop."" I didn't stop until the end of the book. Bill Bryson is, simply put, an amazing writer. It was a mix of science, history, and anecdote in just the right proportions. A previous reviewer spoke about the doomsday stuff about impending asteroids, earthquakes, and other natural disasters; that's true and if it keeps you awake at night, this isn't the book for you. But if natural science is a dark cave and you're looking for the guy with a flashlight who is 10 feet ahead of you, this is your book."
5,Excellent,"Bryson is like a teacher who despite having no deep knowledge of the subjects he is teaching succeeds admiringly because he knows just enough and imparts his knowledge with such eloquence and wit that learning becomes fun. Since finishing this book some four months ago, I have retained at least a third of the information laid out in its 500+ pages. This may not sound much but given the massive number of facts presented (and my deficient attention span), that's a credit to Mr. Bryson.This is an entertaining and educational book well worth reading."
2,This short history is really too short,"I'd heard quite a bit about this book so decided to finally read it. I'm not a professional scientist, but have read widely on evolution and astronomy. However, even I found this book a bit too short. It's really geared toward people with little understanding of the science of astronomy or life. Having said that, it might be a good read for people with no prior interest or knowledge of these fields of science. Hopefully it will encourage more people to pursue careers in these fields. But it may not entertain readers with more background in these fields."
5,Excellent book,"This is a great book for who doesn't have a solid background in the history of the world and science in general (I fit into this category). I was a little concerned that some of the content in the book would be over my head based on a few other reviews I read. However, this wasn't the case at all. The author does a great job of ""dumbing down"" the facts and making them understandable/interesting for the average reader. This book actually stimulated my interest in science, to my surprise."
5,The biggest fault of this book is that it eventually ends..,"A witty, erudite and totally fascinating romp through science and the (sometimes) eccentric personalities of the scientists and thinkers whose breakthroughs and/or missteps provided the foundation of most scientific thought today. This is a book that I absolutely could not put down and I was sorry to see it end. Bryson has the most wonderful talent to educate and entertain simultaneously."
5,Entertaining Journey Through the Universe,I got this book because I could not find the one I wanted. I was hoping I made the right decision. I have been really enjoying this book. Bryson explains Science in a way that makes it extremely interesting and understandable. I'm very glad I got took a chance on it.
3,"Below average pop-sci, above average almost-fiction","Sadly this book is inaccurate in some areas, which is quite regrettable, but the author makes up for it with a laugh-a-minute fun read. As long as the reader understands ahead of time that this is a pop-sci book written by a non-scientist for non-scientists and that it should be read for the enjoyment of the writing and not as a basis to learn from.The scientific readers out there should understand that the non-scientific mass audience that this book is targeted towards could care less about a few inaccuracies. If they wanted perfect science they wouldn't be reading pop-sci. Feel free to clamor if it starts getting assigned in classrooms, but until then I don't think you'll convert any 'average' readers to your cause."
3,"Good book, but not Brysons best","I'll go ahead and admit, I'm a huge Bill Bryson fan. I have loved every book of his that I read so far. That was, until I picked up ""A Short History of Nearly Everything"". Now let me be clear, this isn't a bad book. Far from it. It's an excellent book and Bryson goes to great length to make every point understandable and clear. But that's just the problem. There is WAY too much detail. Bill goes into excruciating detail to explain the history and mechanics of every topic he covers. It was far too overwhelming for me and I found myself getting bored with each chapter. I can only handle so much detail before I'm ready for a new subject.If you're the type who loves nitty-gritty details, then this book is for you. Bryson leaves no stone unturned and makes sure his readers understand every facet of every topic he covers.Recommended: Eh... I just cant."
3,A decent general science book,"This is a decent general natural history science book, covering a fairly wide range of topics. Bryson offers the fresh, intelligent perspective of a curious lay person, although the writing is dry at times. At other times, I found myself wishing that Bryson had elaborated more, like when he made the remarkable observation that our world is still in an Ice Age. Bryson does inspire an appreciation for what we take pretty much for granted - what he calls our cosmic luck on Earth."
5,very curious,"Before reading two great books, I was very curious about two things...science and women! The two books that helped me understand these two things were this book and The Nice Guys Guide To Getting Girls. Now I really do fell like I know the history of everything!! I liked Bryson's book because of its easy laymen terms and its ""non-intimidating"" way of explaining science. I didn't really like science in high school, but this book made it so easy, fun, and humorous to understand. It's not the same old boring, hard to understand stuff that I remember from high school. After reading this book, I understand and learned so much more about science and the scientists who have changed history!"
4,Great Argument for Creation Theory,"I've been listening to this book from a months worth of audible.com. I'm not through it yet, but the most interesting thing about the book so far is that science and scientific theories are based upon very little data! I mean, I've never enjoyed the sciences as much as I might, but it really makes you scratch your head to think that the basis for what we consider scientific ""fact"" is built upon supposition upon supposition. Despite that, it's still a good book, just so you can at least begin to be conversant in what the fraternal order of scientific eggheads are so vigorously fighting over in the cafeteria. No. I don't hate scientists, either. My brother is one of those frighteningly bright people (National Merit Finalist, went to Johns Hopkins and UC Berkely) and actually, so am I. This book should encourage you to really examine scientists' claims and weigh the proof of what they say for yourself- as far as it is possible!"
4,"I consider myself an intelligent, educated person","But this book made me feel like I've been living under a rock. There abounds new, fascinating information on you, the earth, and the universe from a macro and micro level. Many times, I found myself having to re-read whole pages because I didn't quite grasp the concept. Longest time I've ever taken to read a book and I can get through one in a day. This author does his pre, post, and home work. It is worth picking up."
4,Good book but not Bryson's best,"Bill Bryson is one of my favorite authors. While this book doesn't have quite as much humor as compared to A Walk in The Woods or The Lost Continent, he still succeeds in creating a very readable book. And this is impressive considering the ambitious scope of this book. I don't know of another author who could make the history of, say, the study of geology accessible, interesting, amusing, and educational. And that is just one of many topics in the book. The only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is that while it strives to bring forward amusing anecdotes, it doesn't have the same flavor of humor in human characters that I enjoy in his other books. But that is comparing Bryson to Bryson. Compared to other authors, Bill is still a great author."
5,A Satisfying Read,"I arbitrarily chose this book from a library because I was looking for something that would educate me about general scientific development. I am very glad that I chose Bill Bryson's book in particular.This book talks a lot about general scientific themes while including a ton of strange tidbits on the side-for example, in a discussion of Newton's work, he mentioned that the scientist took a needle and shoved it 'betwixt my eye and the bone near to it' just for kicks. This funny, energetic way of writing held me through 624 pages loaded chock full of material. Bryson can communicate plenty of information without boring the reader, and that is an achievement that everyone should appreciate."
5,good read,"still working through the book. so far, so good. very interesting and very informative. the book does read much like a text book; maybe i was expecting something else."
4,Interesting and thought provoking comparisons,This book is entertaining for both the novice as well as the more knowledgable. Bryson describes aspects of nature to enable the reader to experience the relationship between everyday things and concepts that may be incomprehensible for the human brain in a basic and humorous manner.
5,Great book,A great history of science and all that stuffs we should know is in there. A very interesting book for sure.
5,WRONG BOOK SENT refund/apology received immediate.,"THE BOOK I ORDERED IS THE ONE PICTURED (BLUE COVER).THE BOOK RECEIVED, IS A LATER REWRITTEN EDITION.NOT WHAT WAS SOLD TO ME AND NOT WHAT I RECEIVED"
4,"It's the ""History"" of everything.","Adrian L. Melott's review says the book is wrong based on his research. Matthew Luke, Jr.'s review also says the book is wrong based on his research. As the truth lies somewhere in the middle - I will continue to enjoy this book."
5,just what i was looking for,this is a swell book if you are looking for an update on our understanding of life on earth.
3,Interesting but not up to my expectations,"The book covers the history of several scientific areas and tries to tell a coherent story covering the most important discoveries. Most chapters give interesting information, but sometimes the historic trivia outnumber the scientific facts and figures. Chapters 4-5-6 are long winded and almost caused me to stop reading (they definitely need rewriting!). The second half of the book (biology, anthropology) has sounder foundations and is better argumented. It is certainly an interesting work for later reference and it gives an interesting and very extensive bibliography. Some of the conclusions are biased or lack correct arguments (especially where physics is involved, it often comes down to popular talking rahter than correctly argumented science, so in the end you learn nothing new). All in all a book worth reading and owning but a little disappointing, considering the enormous expectations formed by some reviews."
4,One-sentence review,"As the title promises, this entertaining popular science book does attempt to chronicle the history of nearly everything--the universe, the earth, life and the human species--but what it does particularly well is chronicle the history of science and just how we figured out all this stuff, which leads, inexorably, to the conclusion that we don't know nearly as much as we like to think we do."
3,Not entirely satisfying,"It is incredible how many facts Mr. Bryson has collected for this book! Unfortunately, a great many more qualify for ""Trivial Pursuit"", rather than making the reader understand things. It seems more about the people, who did science, than about science itself.Still, for someone, who is at present at most mildly interested in science (and unfortunately, there are all too many people like this, at least for my taste!), this book could well serve to spark his or her interest in our world, which is fascinating as it is - and the most fascinating thing about it is, that it is understandable without such silly devices as creationism!If the book manages to spark those interests, it has done a service to humanity."
4,Very Good Read,"Like some of the other readers, I was quite pleased with this book.It was obviously written for individuals (like myself) who don't havea strong background in science, but yearn to know about the originsof life. It fit the bill as a primer since it covered many topics.Now I'm in search for more knowledge on this subject matter.I would appreciate anyone's recommendations for further reading."
5,Bravo!,"Funny, readable, interesting, moving, insightful, mind-blowing, and just about everything else you'd expect from this great author--everything but the kitchen sink! This book is a must for everyone. Kudos to Mr. Bryson!Also recommended: A Walk in the woods and McCrae's Bark of the Dogwood"
3,Fascinating yet too Expansive,"Bill Bryson's ""A Short History of Nearly Everything"" is a fascinating read. Bryson tackles various scientific topics like the atom, tectonic plates, evolution, and bacteria. Bryson writes well and some of the facts he provides are wonderful to think about.The book's strength and weakness is that Bryson discusses so many topics. At times it seems like there is little connection between one chapter and the next. He would have done well to expand on a few related topics such as life on the microscopic level (atoms, bacteria, etc.) rather than seek to discuss ""nearly everything."""
4,Great Read for Non-Scientists,"Read this book for my school's library without knowing much about the topic. Being a Social Studies teacher, I typically find science reading to be rather dry. What's nice about Bryson's presentation is that he gears his books to those without a scientific background and really writes about the history of science rather than focusing on the process. My husband who teaches math at the local college, is currently reading the book, and also enjoys the story-telling nature of Bryson's writing. A great, relaxing read but not for those looking to use this book as a reference or to learn theories in science."
4,Enjoyable read for Bryson fans,"If you enjoy Bill Bryson's writing then you'll probably enjoy this book, particularly if you're looking for a grand overview of, well, nearly everything. It's short (well, considering its scope), and it gives an overview of a vast amount of material. And the thing about Bryson's writing is, it is tremedously accessible. He writes in a style that is easy to read and easy to grasp. This is not a text book nor is it intended (I think) to be a rigorous text. It is what it is, which is an enjoyable introduction to a bunch of scientific thought. In an age when science education is seemingly under attack, that is no bad thing."
4,"Enjoyable, thought provoking.","I read this and then bought a copy for my kids, with the endorsement that this is great ""conversational science"". It is, in fact, the author's rambling thoughts on topics ranging from Archaeology through Zoology and includes great discussions on the origins of life and its ephemeral nature. It is not a textbook in any sense, just a great book to make one stop and consider our existence from a broader perspective than we generally do."
1,I could not believe this book.,"I could not believe this book.Trirobite is named for the three longitudinal lobes, a center axial lobe and flanking pleural lobes.But he says, ""all shared a basic body plan of three parts, or lobes-head, tail, thorax-from which comes the name"".(PG.323)That's the question of our junior high school admission exams, around 12 years old.Also there are too many lame notifications and lies that comfortable to the readers.He has the enthusiast to make money than to make credits.All his writings are not bat and I know the author is not the archetypal american but regrettable."
1,ripped off,"I ordered Bryson's book ""A short History of Nearly Everything"", By Bill Bryson. I odered a used copy that stated it was in very good condition. I received the book and did not look through it until a week or so later. To my dismay the first 90 yes 90 pages were missing. This was a huge rip off and I am very upset about this!"
2,A Short History of Nearly Everything,Very disappointed in the quality of the book as I had seen a friend's copy which was a much superior version with many photographs and drawings. Also much better quality paper.
3,Some thoughts,"If you want to read a very interesting book about historical roots and cultural influences read ""The Golden Milestone: Over 2500 Years of Italian Contributions to Civilization,"" about very influential Romans, Italians and Italian Americans."
5,This is my favorite book by Bryson,"I bought this book thinking it would be packed with Bryson's wit and humor. It's not. It is packed with one well-researched story after another that chronicle the history of science and discovery. I've read most of the popular non fiction works by Sagan, Greene, Hawking, Asimov, Ferris and others. Bryson tells it the best. This book has a permanent place in my short stack."
5,Much stuff I'd mused over assembled into an enjoyable tome,"Probably not a whole lot of stunning new data here, but well-researched, extremely well-written--""So THAT'S what happened to the dinosours!""--segments. Much effort at illustrating how certain early phenomena affected historical events through the ages.I'm a slow reader, but I read through this one in record time. Highly recommend."
5,A great way to learn about science,"In learning history, it's easier to learn it in the context of a story than with a table of dates and events, so too with science.By covering the discovery of various scientific facts and theories as their story of how the scientists of their day figured them out, Bryson entertains the reader with fascinating background and makes the learning of science a pleasant byproduct of the story.It's a longer fluffier read than just reading a science text. For those who are just after the answers, read something else. But I found many of the stories fascinating. How did they figure out the weight and size of the earth? Or how far we are from the sun?Good stuff and nicely written -- if you don't mind a little fluff here and there (sometimes Bryson is a bit over the top on cheerleading about how interesting it all is)."
1,a book with many misunderstandings,"Limited access to Japanese resources, outdated European references, lack of basic knowledge about Asian History ended in a book with many misunderstandings, e.g. the toponymy of Mount Fuji or the use of word ""Ainu"" in ancient Chinese documents."
3,Hmm,This is a book that is hard to understand. It says one thing and then a few sentences later it says a totally different thing. What is what really?
4,very spiritual,"I want guidance from my guardian angel and the book shows how to achieve communication via breathing, introspection and believing."
2,"Sadly, not eventful, with no singular voice.","I am sorry to have to be negative in my review of this recording. I have had it on LP for a while and decided to give it another listen for recollection. At first, you imagine the sun rising over some distant Indian landscape, but the album never does rise to anything. The orchestra is way too melodic in the sense that they all play the same charts in unison. The composition is just boring. Perhaps that is how the meditative mood is presented, but I could not meditate to something so poorly composed. I think the problem is that there rises no singular voice, no instrument that rises above the background symphony, just all background, poorly composed. Please do yourself the great pleasure of buying both Journey in Satchadanda and Ptah, the El Daoud which are two of my most treasured recordings and see my reviews on them."
1,Deffective Disc,"While I enjoyed the content of this DVD, it ultimately turned out be defective. The disc froze and skipped in several places. It did this on both of my DVD players and in my computer. I returned it to Amazon.com and received a replacement. Unfortunately, the replacement did the same thing and in the same places. Maybe, when new stock arrives at Amazon, it will not contain these defects."
4,Like it Used to Be,"This is the first Randy Rogers Band album that I have bought and this c.d. is awesome. This album is probably the best Texas Music c.d. that I have come across in the past couple of years. It blends regular Texas Music with traditional Country with lots of steel guitar.Every song on this c.d. is good. The first four tracks are really good, but tracks eight and nine are my favorites. The Randy Rogers Band are well on thier way to being one of the best acts in Texas Music today. Buy this album and you will not be disappointed. It is well worth the money."
3,Stinky tablets,"I have taken Indole 3 Carbinol for several years. This was the first time that I ordered this brand as my favorite, Now brand, was no longer available. I can't speak to the efficacy, but the odor of the tablets is stinky. I will be searching for an alternative choice with my next order."
1,Everlast pilates Door knob rope exerciser review,"I had one of the original rope exercisers by Weider. This exercise rope does not pull smoothly through the pulley system and at first it dropped black plastic pieces into my face. After the excess was wore off of the plastic it quit shedding. I would send it back, except the postage return cost would leave me clearing less than $2.00. It was a bad buy for me, but I put it away in case I have to use it later. I went on amazon less than a week later and found a rope exercise with the old pulley system that glides smoothly through the exercises, this system did not appear when I ordered the first time. I payed more than the pilates door knob exerciser; but at least it is like my old one."
1,Dont get this,"This concept is great. I had one in the 80's and it worked fine but this one from Everlast sucks. When in use the rope will fray and flake off on your face, the plastic wheels get hot from the friction and warp. It looks like it is going to break soon so I am going to return and try a different maker."
1,Horrible product,This thing is horrible. It is not as simple as the Joe Weider Body shaper from the 70's and the pully system is cumbersome. I will be sending it back for a refund.
3,Not Quite Right,"You get what you pay for with the Everlast Pilates Door Knob Rope Exerciser but a couple of things could have made it so much better. The ropes are way too short especially for any floor exercises. If a tall person tried to use this or the door knob you are attaching the device to is high on the door it is impossible to use.Also the 'Step bt Step Fitness Guide' alluded to on the web page and on the packaging is 1 sheet of paper with only 2 exercises. A search on the Everlast web site does not turn up any other exercise guides. It is possible to make some exercises of your own but surely the 'designers' of this exerciser had more in mind. Why not include more? The one sheet of instruction provided is only printed on one side, plenty of room to add more exercises"
3,good for a beginner,"if you do not always go to a gym to workout, this product might be good for you. however, as an avid ""gym rat"" i literally pulled the product off the door when i tried to use it. maybe i shouldn't go to the gym everyday??? for a beginner, it would be a good product..."
2,NOT AS GOOD AS I HOPED,"I HAD ONE OF THOSE TWISTED ROPE TYPE EXERCISERS AND IT FINALLY BROKE AFTER 20 YEARS. THEY ARE NOW CLOSE TO AND MORE THAN 20 BUCKS SO I BOUGHT THIS ONE. IT'S USABLE BUT ONCE YOU USE THE GOOD STUFF FROM WAY BACK WHEN, THE STUFF THEY MAKE NOW JUST DOESN'T ADD UP."
2,quality/ease of use,"this exerciser has decreased in quality over the past 30 years. The door knob loop slips off. the whole item is clunky and poorly designed. It will work, but not with the ease of the older model."
3,Wrong size.,"Product sez, ""Pilates for HER."" I was purchassing this for me, but it is too small. I would like the same product except, ""For HIM.""I will keep the one I have for my wife, but, I need a longer size for my greater leg and arm length."
5,Everlast for Her Pilates Door Knob Rope Exerciser,"Love this product. Used the same type of thing in the 70's. I think the trick is to move slowly during the exercises, it really has shaped and toned my mid-section -- I'm moving back to a pear shape again after turning into an apple shape with menopause.Wrap the cord around the doorknob twice and it won't come off. Fabulous for the price. Even took it on vacation with me."
2,"Good quality materials and price, but made in child size","This would be great if the ropes were long enough but they aren't. I had to add onto the door knob attachment so I could get my head away from the door. The leg/arm ropes are also a good foot too short for even a medium height woman, you can't extend your arms overhead to be able to get a lot better workout than having to keep your elbows bent and on the floor. I may try to figure out how to add some length to the ropes. Pilates needs to look at the old ones from the 80s which were much better to use with the longer ropes except they didn't hold up since they were made with cheap plastic."
1,Cheap product for a cheap price,"I read the negative review on here but bought it anyway. Yes, you will need to add rope to extend it and devise a means so that it stays on the doorknob...as designed it will not stay on. I just started to use it today and hope the black rope doesn't flake in my face too, it does not slide smoothly through the pulleys.I also once had the great rope exerciser from long ago advertised on tv..this product is inferior. Too bad..I would gladly have paid much more for a quality product. Maybe an entrepreneur will read this and design something usable for $50 to $75 as I can't find anything else out there except this junky product."
1,Everlast Pilates Door Rope Exerciser for Her,"This is the worst exerciser I have ever purchased. This exerciser does not allow you to tighten the ropes over the door handle & it slips off. I believe the foam piece also is partly to blame. Additionally, the ropes are not long enough. I am only 5' 6"", but cannot straighten my legs out without my head touching the door. This is not the correct way to operate an exerciser of this sort. The directions are also printed so small that I could barely read them, plus there were only a couple of different exercises shown. I am very unhappy with this purchase & recommend anyone looking at this particular exerciser try a different brand. I have used 2 other brands in the past & they were both 100x better than this."
5,A ++++++,"Eddie Jobson fresh from UK, fills the shoes of John Evan and David Palmer as arranger and main Keyboardist/violinist. Overall it's like a breath of fresh air after the below average Stormwatch, the band needed new blood after 7 years with the same lineup and they got it with Jobson, even though it was short lived."
2,Don't waste your time or money,I love Jethro Tull. They are my all time favorite band. But even the bands you love release a dog every now and then.This is Tull's dog.Woof woof.
3,Interesting Reading,"I read these two articles when they were on-line and responded to Mr. Edney in considerable length about them. I found the articles to be well-written and interesting reading, but most of what they had to say was completely wrong. If you're a liberal, you'll love these two articles. If you're a beer-swilling, football-watching conservative, you'll hate them. If you're a thinking conservative, you'll find them challenging without being off-putting.I don't know if I can put a link in here, but if you'd like to read my responses to Mr. Edney's articles and his response to my first response, you can find them here: http://www.freewebs.com/rebuttal/where.htm(n.b. I'm not selling anything in my link.)"
1,You can't be serious,"This ""book"" reads like a poorly written high school essay. Lots of unsupported assertions or cites to others who make unsupported claims."
3,Too Repetitious,"Basically this is a good program about the pressures and time-lines involved in pouring concrete high above street level in downtown New York City. The entire crew - drivers, pumpers, spreaders, have 90 minutes from the time the concrete is loaded into the truck. Pump breakdowns, crane unavailability, etc. don't stop the clock. Jobs are on the line, as well as millions of dollars - if the pour is mismanaged (incorrect concrete quality, cold joints) it will have to be ripped out and redone.The bad news about this program is that it is incredibly repetitive -"
5,Martha is fantastic,"This is the Martha we all know and love. I really miss the old show format...the live show is great and spontaneous, but I really miss the practical and entertaining segments that I have saved on VHS and DVD for the last 12-13 years."
5,Get this for your grandkids,This is a marvelous gift for your children and grandchildren. They sing many of the songs in pre-K. A great introduction to a great music man.
1,ONE STAR IS TOO MANY,"For the love of God please let this be the last of the ""Spoofing Other, Better Movies"" Movies, because this is absolutely the bottom of the barrel. For starters, somehow the people that made this movie failed to see that if any of those other spoof movies were actually any good, it was because they were making fun of movies that weren't already funny - i.e. satire. Making a comedy making fun of other comedies is just a stupid idea, and this movie is proof of that theory.The acting is as bad as the writing - crap, crap, and more crap.For the sake of us all, don't buy this movie - you'll only encourage them to make more and they aren't worth the plastic they're printed on."
1,41- Year-Old Virgin Who Knocked Up Sarah Marshall and Felt Superbad About It,"I'm usually a fan of parodies, I enjoyed Date Movie and the Scary Movie series, but after watching an hour (yes, I only watched an hour of it), I began to feel sick to my stomach. Many gross out jokes, that were really disgusting. Over-the-top sex joke and scenes, including a girl stick a toy in mouth and accidentally swallows and she begins to choke. The movie have disgusting jokes, I usually have a strong stomach, but I felt disgusted. I turned it off and began to watch a true masterpiece, The Runaways."
3,Predictable and Silly!!!,"I thought this movie had some very funny moments, but others were gross and annoying. One part I loved was that it spoofed Twilight, because I can't stand Twilight. Bryan Callen stars as Andy, a 41 year old who really wants to lose his virginity. His friends from the movies Superbad, Knocked Up, and Benjamin Button try to help him along the way. He meets Sarah at a bar, and she thinks that Andy is her baby's daddy after a 1 night stand. Andy begins to fall in love with another woman named Kim. Who will he choose? If you like spoofs and silly comedy, you may enjoy THE 41 YEAR OLD VIRGIN WHO KNOCKED UP SARAH MARSHALL AND FELT SUPERBAD ABOUT IT!!!"
5,Thank you,"This is a funny movie that i would watch again and again and again, some people might not like this movie but then some might will."
2,I can't believe I sat through it all.,"I rented this on iTunes and found myself surfing the net as the movie played. I admit that I haven't seen all the movies it was spoofing, but still, surfing while viewing is not a good sign.The most amusing part of the whole film was the very end bit (played over the end credits). I give it two stars instead of one just because of that."
2,Listen to Ten Minute Podcast,This movie was horrible but I bought it to support Bryan Callen and the Ten Minute Podcast by clicking on the Amazon link on their page. The spoofing movies are really lame but Bryan is still funny.
1,What happened Bryan Calln?,He always was funny. This was one of the worst movies I ever saw. I had medium expectations and it was shocking. So bad.
4,Toy nap-and-play crib,"This little crib is a great gift for little ones--they love that it looks like a real pack-and-play! Its easy assembly makes it an even greater purchase. It seems durable, and it's great for holding toys when playtime is over!"
5,Amazing!,"I seriously did not think that this product would reduce my hot flashes (at least 10 sweaty/hot/nervewracking hot flashes daily and one each time I wake at nite), but have been pleasantly surprised!I HAVE TRIED EVERYTHING. The only other product that worked was Motherwort tincture, but the drops have to be taken just as a hot flash starts (when you can tell it's creeping up but aren't actually flashing yet), and has to be taken each time a hot flash starts. Not too convenient. I take Natrol Soy Isoflavones, 1 capsule, 3 times daily. I have noticed a CONSIDERABLE drop (80%) in the number of hot flashes. I have been taking this for less than a month, and will continue to do so."
5,Wonderful reading,I thoroughly loved this book. The flow through time was wonderful. The author makes you feel like you are there.
1,The Dragon & the Raven review,"I struggled to read this book. The story dragged enough that I lost interest, and did not finish it. There was no spark to keep one interested. I am avid reader and seldom have this issue. The story line felt like it was laborious. The characters, at times, felt bland."
2,One Long Commercial,"RAT appears to be a fine fighting system. Unfortunately you won't learn much of the system using this tape. If you decide that you want to learn the sytem I recommend you find someone to teach you. The video tape gives a nice cursory overview of what the system consists of, but that's all. And in that case, it is very much overpriced. I would be happy now if I had spend about 20 bucks to learn what RAT is, but not a penny more."
4,Accurate Highs and Lows.,Using local weather data I adjusted the barometric pressure reading on my Weems & Plath 461400 Westport Baro/Thermo/ Hygrometer the day I got it in the mail. During the ensuing two months the pressure remains accurate with the original data source. Previously owned weather instruments were not as consistently reliable.
3,Barometer Lovely not Large,This barometer is beautiful but it is not large and not any larger than the tide clock as represented.
5,Steve to the rescue!,"This DVD contains 4 wonderful episodes of Blue's Clues, all featuring the original Steve who my son loves. We've watched a lot of this show but I haven't seen these episodes. It also has a poetry game with Blue in addition to the episodes. Steve is really interactive with the viewer so my son really pays the most attention to this show, because the host is talking to him and involving him in the entire show :) Our favorite episode on this one is the one where he plays with puppets!"
5,great!,"The DVD Came in great condition and shipped quickly. Your kids will love this if they enjoy blues clues! The classic episodes are great, with the original Steve character. Loved it!"
1,Disc does not work - why is Amazon selling a defective product?,"My boys love Blue's Clues, so we were so excited to get this video! The first episode played fine, but for the rest of the episodes, the sound was off by a few seconds so the words weren't matching what they were saying on the video. We returned the disk with no issue (Amazon picked up the old one and sent a new one for no charge). Unfortunately, the new disk had the same problem!! Amazon should stop selling this product until they resolve this issue."
5,oil wars,"Another point of view on The United States and their Middle East policy. Well written, concise and very plausible."
2,Good to see emerging talent,Phoebe Cates is a beautiful woman and it is nice to see where some of her acting talent stated. Willie Ames on the other hand couldn't act his way out of a paper bag.
1,Thank God for Phoebe Cates.,I would have loved this movie when I was twelve. The only redeeming thing about it was seeing Phoebe Cates naked.
1,A waste of celluloid,"Unless you are an enormous admirer of Phoebe Cates (or for some reason, Willie Aames) avoid this film. Even if you are, I wouldn't bother."
2,An interesting movie if you are 14,I enjoy the movie some years ago...Cates is very pretty here and I love the music
2,Blue Lagoon Rip-Off,"First of all, the movie is really a Blue Lagoon rip-off, with unbelievable plot. Even the situation leading to the nudity is unbelievable!The DVD itself is badly done. The cover looks cheap. The transfer is bad. Some parts are purposely blurred. No extras. It surely doesn't warrant the price of $19.99 but more like $4.99!The extra star in the rating is just because it's a Phoebe Cates debut. If you're not her fan, don't bother buying."
3,Paradise not really,This DVD is an edited version of the movie. To create the widescreen effect they simply cut of the top and bottom of the original fullscreen VHS version. They also added computer generated blur in the nude scenes. I already have this movie on VHS and I was looking for a more durable version on DVD. My old VHS version is much better.
4,5 stars for Phoebe!,"But it's downgraded to four becuase the movie itself is very ordinary.It starts off interesting, and the first half isn't bad, but it gets more boring as it goes along, and the ending is a bit of an anti-climax.I have the Korean import, and the only thing censored is Aames's genitals, which concerns me little, and probably doesn't concern you.It only actually runs for 90 minutes, but there's already plenty of nudity and sex in it (more than I expected), so I'm personally not too fussed about the 'uncut or not' issue..."
2,Not That Great,"Can't give this one more that 2 stars, because the nude scenes just weren't that good. Maybe it was the quality of the dvd, which was poor, or the way they were shot. Whatever, the story was dumb, acting was bad, and since the main reason for buying the disk was for Phoebe Cates nude scenes, it wasn't worth it. Better quality would have added a least one star."
2,It SHOULD Be ON DVD!!!,"This movie has one of the best looking females EVER... Phoebe Cates in it! If that's not enough to make you want this film, your dead from the waist down! Ok, the movie is dorky and laughable at times, but you'll be too busy drooling at the skimpy costumes she wears, the naked waterfall scene! The naked underwater scenes! Enough said.. Own this film! And pray to God it finally get's released onto an American DVD release. There is a Japanese company doing a DVD release of this (She's real popular in Japan!) but it's a region 2 DVD so unless you have a region free player, your outta luck. Also, not sure of the quality either."
1,Rubbish acting and not nearly as much nudity as you think!,"Basically, I agree with the previous reviewer, who summarized the plot nicely: The plot, such as it is, tells the absurd tale of missionary-son boy and proper British girl who are left alone together after their adult guardians are murdered by an Arab bandit leader who desires her body...and apparently has nothing else to do other than persue the fleeing couple for months.This trash has absolutely no redeeming qualities other than briefly featuring Phoebe Cates naked. However, if that's what you're interested in, I recommend checking out ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High"" instead."
1,A Softcore Porn Children's Film?!,"I admit it. I only bought this movie for one reason: the lovely Phoebe Cates is topless in much of the movie. (Okay, so make that two reasons.) On this point, I was not disappointed.That said, I made the mistake of trying to watch this turkey of a movie from beginning to end. I believe the makers of this movie were confused about who their target audience is.On one hand, the film contains a lot of nudity and sex. On the other, the film features dumbed-down, bad dialogue and patently groan-worthy attempts at humor, the kind of humor that only 5 year old children would find amusing. Really, the scenes with the monkeys were as childish as they were totally out-of-place in a softcore porn flick."
5,Hotter than Hades!,Sure it's a rip-off of Blue Lagoon but Phoebe Cates is SUPER HOT and naked throughout the entire movie. What else could you want? Nice to see this on DVD. Blows away the old VHS version for sure.
1,"Definite ""Blue Lagoon"" rip-offf","And of all the actors in Hollywood, who decided to pair beautiful Phoebe Cates with Willie Aames in this story?"
5,When will we have the DVD version?,"Well, I don't care about the script, the scenary, ..... I seriously think that this is a gem if you are a fan of Phoebe. She is so stunningly beautiful that I sincerely hope there will be a DVD version of it. (It's so sad that there is no LD version at all) Why, you need to repeatedly watch Phoebe smiling, showering (and of course getting naked, I admit), and you need to watch it in still. If you want to watch Phoebe in nudidy, this movie is far greater than Private School, and Fast times at Ridgemont High, or TV's Lace."
4,"5 stars for Phoebe, -1 for the movie itself...","Plot? Acting? Dialogue? Please. You're buying this movie for the same reason everyone else did... and for that alone, it gets 4 stars. The incredible Phoebe Cates is, indeed, both topless and fully nude several times, yet the nudity is actually done very tastefully. (And yes, not to be sexist, if you're a female fan of ""Charles in Charge,"" you also get a glimpse of Willie's willie.) As for the alleged use of a body double, the shower and swimming scenes are 100% Phoebe (hi-def super slo-mo doesn't lie).This ridiculous debate over whether this is a rip-off of ""Blue Lagoon"" (which, IMO it is) is a moot point. If you were one of the millions of young men whose minds were blown by Ms. Cates in ""Fast Times,"" then hit the Buy button. If you actually want to watch a good movie, then look elsewhere, my friends. End of story."
5,Great case,This case truly does make beading a breeze.... keeps beads from spilling into each other even when traveling... Very cool cases I highly approve!
3,"Nice case, doesn't hold beading tools","These case fits all of my big pendants and string rolls nicely, but it doesn't fit pliers at all! You have to really force them in there and it's not easy to close. I guess I'll just have to keep them in the same basket as my yarn and other things which is a bit inconvenient."
3,cable,I was kind of disappointed the cable is thin I was hoping that the cable would be a little thicker and or stronger
5,Awesomeness,"This is a great product! Works great and does the job I need it to do! It's cheap, and it does what it's supposed to do. I plug in my camera and then hooked up to my computer. Then it is donw. A perfect cable, and it is low profile. I had a Q-see cable that was white and hated that it stuck out like a sore thumb. Great product.Highly recommeded!"
4,videosecu 150 feet audio video power security cable with bnc,good quality and product is exactly as described and very easy to set up and arrived quickly and properly packed
2,Video Quality is sub-par,"I ordered these cables to go along with a Swann system I installed at our small business.My first observation was that the cord is much thinner than the stock 65 ft cables provided with the kit I purchased. This may me because there is less shielding around the wires and that the wires are thinner in general.The video quality was very poor in my opinion. The picture was fuzzy and grainy compare to the stock cables. Maybe you won't notice on a 400 TVL resolution system, but for our 660 TVL system, it looked pathetic. So much so that I returned two of the three cables I purchased. I only kept the one I opened since I took it out of the package. It is installed currently and there is a CLEAR DIFFERENCE in the quality.I would NOT recommend this to anyone, even for the low price. It would be better as jump rope."
3,This book was okay,It wasn't bad for the most part. it was nice reading the different ways people's lives turned out. Some parts of this book were a little boring to me though. I felt like it was too many people whining about getting too much money or being in too much debt.
4,Nelly Returns to the Waves,"St. Louis rapper Nelly hits the airwaves with the first single from his new album ""Nellyville."" The song is very catchy and was one of the summer of 2002's biggest hits. Not much a rap music due to the high level of originality that market has (e.g., sampling Broadway musicals, Duran Duran songs, etc..) but Nelly has proven that with this song that not only can he get his groove on, but that he can produce a single with high potential for market crossover success. Regardless of his feud with other old-school rap artists such as KRS-1, Nelly's appeal lies in his ability to adapt to the times, something that many rappers have not been able to do. Only a handful artists such as Busta Rhymes, Queen Latifah, and Ice Cube have mastered the art of keeping with rap's evolution, and so far Nelly has. Overall, ""Hot in Here"" is a great summer anthem sure to keep anyone moving. Regardless of the song's critics it remains one of 2002's best jams."
2,Ummm..ok,"I bought this import single for the remixes...and they totally ... Don't get this for anything, just get the Nellyville Album. If you want remixes of Hot In Herre...well, sorry. There are none."
5,THE CD IS THE BEST,i like the nellyville cd b/c it got a song one there that i give to my sister b/c her boyfriends nicknames nelly. you kno what song i mean #10 Dileama
2,The Mind: Its Multiple Projections & Multiple Facets,"I wasn't too thrilled with this book. I'm not into early morning meditations or into crazy diets. It might be great for anybody else, but I did not like the book at all."
3,Ugly Little Secrets,"This is a horrid book.The stories in this collection deal with the vilest human emotions and perverse tendencies. They are so disgusting that you keep wanting to stop reading - but you can't.An early work by Ian McEwan, what captivates the reader is his attention to detail and his attempt to get into the psyche of suspected child molesters/murderers, nymphomaniacs, incestuous teenagers, maldjusted mommy's boys and the whole cast of miscreants - perhaps unfair labels that McEwan seek to tear off and show the person behind the deeds.Maintaining an objective, non-judgmental tone throughout, McEwan manages to shock and outrage his reader, making you feel as powerless as the victims in his stories.I'm glad I read it, but it's not a book I want to revisit."
1,UGH!!,"The perplexingly amateurish choral readings that introduce the musical pieces put me off early...and I never recovered. Why weren't actors hired for these readings?Having read the libretto first, I had some idea of the type of music I wanted to hear. I understand the concept of writing against the obvious but, for example, I wanted to hear SOME terror in the music and vocals of ""Move Over"". If I'd heard it cold, and out of context, I would have assumed a romantic ""afterglow"" backstory to the song on this recording.I'm regrettably disappointed.Wanting More in Minnesota"
1,"Sorry, I had to return this one!","I purchased more than 100 Jazz recordings last week alone. Including Armstong, Goodman, Art Blakey, Coltrane, Miles Davis, Chet Baker, Lee Morgan, Clifford Brown, Dave Brubeck, Branford Marsalis, Joshua Redman, etc., etc., etc. I even purchased other Wynton Marsalis recordings. Of all of them, I could not help but return this to the store from which I bought it. Normally, they don't take things back but because I purchase so many CD's from them as well as Amazon, they agreed. Sorry, this is boring, with emphasis on the boring. Regardless of whatever awards Wynton has won as a result of this work. I am into results, not polls or awards. There were also polls that said Clinton had a 68% approval ratings. From who? Wyonton Marsalis is a great composer/musician but this one does not warrant the praise."
3,Quaint and dated (yet still with charm)!,"Even on vacation, Pam and Jerry North can't help bumping into dead bodies. This time they're in Key West, and Pam, who has gotten up early to catch fish for some pelicans, finds a newly stabbed corpse on the pier. The dead man is the former Deputy Medical Examiner of New York County--Dr. Edmund Piersal--with whom the Norths' had played tennis only the day before."
5,Buttery soft,I gave this to my husband as an anniversary gift. He loves it! It's full of inserts. It fits an iPad perfectly. Love this.
2,Expensive and poorly laid out,Purchased more informative books for less than half the price. Sorry I spent the money on this one would not recommend
5,Aromatherapy for Health Professionals,The book arrived in great condition and in a timely manner. The service was very professional!
3,Disappointed,"After reading the glowing reviews and receiving a recommendation for this book from a nurse friend, I am sorry to report that I am disappointed. I will admit that I haven't read this book from start to finish, but after going through portions that are immediately relevant to me, a first-time mom to a 3-month-old, I have found that the advice has contradicted other things I've read, namely about breastfeeding. I also find the tone to be too cut and dry. The author doesn't leave room for variability in kids, such as that newborns should feed only after a certain number of hours. Babies are all different and there is a large range for normal. I much prefer the books published by the American Academy of Pediatrics."
3,Okay,"Not the greatest book to use as a reference guide. Can be confusing when trying to use the index to research symptoms. Overall, I think there are better books out there to buy."
1,Dr. Schmitt is not very educated about dogs,"He claims that ""Pit bull terriers are extremely dangerous."" This statement is completely untrue, as Pit bulls have consistently performed better on temperament tests than many dogs, including Golden Retrievers. Pit bull bites as reported in the media are more often than not actually other breeds that have been misidentified as Pit bulls. Pit bulls used to be called nanny dogs because they are so great with children. You better get your facts straight Dr. Schmitt. He also picks on Saint Bernards, Dobermans, and German Shepherds. As a former nanny I have seen far too many parents not supervise their children around the dog. Too many children are rough and not very nice to the family dog. Dogs have feelings too and do not deserve to be hit, bit, or have their tails pulled. Regardless of the breed, dogs can only take so much inhumane treatment before they growl. A growl is their warning and parents and kids need to realize that."
5,I still use this after 10 years,I bought this book about 10 years ago (previous version) and I still refer to it today. I give it at all baby showers because it is so good. It has the right combination of home remedies and when to consult the pros.
5,your child's health,"I love this book! Someone gave it to me as a ""pay it forward"" and I have given it to every mom I can!"
4,Useful book,"This was one of the most useful books we've owned. And we've gifted it to some of our parent friends, for their first year as parents. Written by a pediatrician, it contains well-organized advice for various common issues parents are bound to face with their children, that they'd rather not call the doctor for. It seemed thorough, and I particularly liked the ""When to call the doctor"" sections. I carried it in a diaper bag, everywhere, for the 1st year. After that, it became less and less useful every year. I don't think we used it after year 3. The book itself goes up to age 18."
5,Best book for Parents,This book is so great. I have used it alot. I think it has saved us from many unnecessary trips to the Dr. It has all the right answers and what to do for injuries or illnesses. It is now a standard baby shower gift from me.
4,mysterious death,This book kept me guessing as to the prepetrator of the murder and why certain things were done until the very end. Reccommend it!
5,Good reader,This book I just happened to see on the shelf at the library and thought I would give it a try. The story was very well written and kept me interested on each page. I really enjoyed the depth of each character and how the storyline kept switching from past to present. It was a little confusing at first but that was on my part as I completely skipped over the dates present in the beginning of each chapter. I was very hooked.
1,Juvenile,"I'm not sure I quite understand the 5 star reviews here. My sister-in-law raved about this and, after reading the reviews here, I picked it for our book club. I read this in two days and I'm not sure just what we'll discuss when we meet. I found the writing to be totally juvenile, about on par with a teen novel. No depth of character anywhere - not one character was developed enough to make me care. The idea that the doctor and sheriff would continue to be best friends with, and socialize with, the judge and his wife, who are so totally without moral compass is ludicrous. Exactly what was it they were afraid of?? The story was predictable to the end, and disappointingly so at that. There - discussion done."
2,Good premise gone bad...,"Well, this book was totally disappointing, and certainly didn't live up to the expectations that I had for it.This is a good example of a great premise that the author fails to follow through on. None of the characters were that well-developed, the writing was quite juvenile and the story weak. There was an awful lot of absurdity in this story. For example, Abby steals Mitch's bird right after he leaves, and in this small town of ""close"" friends, the Judge and his wife never knew she had it? Even after 17 years? Ridiculous!I have never been a fan of the books by Fern Michaels and Belva Plain, but if you are, then you might enjoy this one. Otherwise, it's best to avoid it."
3,"3.5, Better Than I Expected",I have never read any books by this author. I wasn't sure if I liked this book until I got about half way through it. Then I wanted to see where the story was going. It actually was a pretty decent read. Nice surprise.
4,This is a Fine Effort,"For the most part, THE VIRGIN OF SMALL PLAINS is a very well done mystery. Pickard does a great job building the story, and all the characters are interesting and sympathetic. This book has a lot of good twists, and I was genuintely surprised by the ending.The middle of THE VIRGIN OF SMALL PLAINS is somewhat slow, and almost resembles a Harlequin romance in spots. The plot did have some unbelievable holes in it, which some other reviewers have pointed out in detail. I am also not a big fan of books where coincidence plays a large role in the plot (which happens multiple times in this book). Still, the book is very enjoyable despite these minor flaws.This book was nominated for the prestigious Edgar award, and won the Agatha award for best novel. I found it a very good read, and recommend it to readers who enjoy well written mysteries with a strong dash of romance."
4,Yes,"Picard has woven a fine story in a small town where secrets are hard to keep, but everyone has a few. She captures the feeling of a small mid-western town. The weather adda another layer to the story. I was well pleased. Nancy Picard keeps getting better and better."
5,A Strong Mystery,"A mystery with a solid arc that pays homage to the story's emotional centerpiece from the first to the last page. Characters react to events at two critical points in their lives, and their core values are put to the test in light of their maturity. Though I figured a few things out early on, the road to get confirmation was filled with doubt, as twists kept plopping down on the page like debris from a twister. It is a story of considerable power dealing with the choices people make throughout their lives, how they justify those choices, and how they reach for redemption later on. The few quibbles about coincidences are insignificant. Highest praises...5 out of 5."
3,Pleasant Surprise,"After a slow start and a few 'why am I reading this' thoughts, I didn't want to put it down. Even though you knew how it would end, the journey was worth it."
3,An intriguing mystery,"I thought this book had a lot of really high points but a couple of low points. I thought the mystery around this story was very well written, using varying points of view to gradually unlayer the truth of the story. I liked being able to see how differently each of the characters looked at what was going on and I have to admit, I didn't guess the outcome of the book until the author wanted me to, though I think I came close a few times. On the other hand, I thought some of the descriptions in this book were far too graphic for my liking and it made me uncomfortable enough that a few times I almost wanted to stop reading. It was thanks to the otherwise well written story that I kept coming back for more and I have to admit I'm glad I did."
5,Up All Night Reading!,"Whew! This book kept me going into the wee small hours of the night! An excellent book overall, with interesting characters, quick plot and all questions answered logically. There are even allusions to St. Therese of the Little Flower in the mix (which would make my mother happy). I found this to be the first real page turner of the summer...we're off to a good start."
2,Unconvincing,"The novel started off good enough, opening right off with some romance and a mystery. Then, everything went downhill. The worst part was the characters, who were unconvincing. The 30-something female protagonist acted like a 16-year-old for the entire novel, instead of the 1987 sections alone. One of the 30-something male protagonists was so emotionally immature, that it was impossible to root for him. Other characters, not even just minor ones, seemed plain stupid. While I can believe that strange things go on in some small, rural towns, this story had too many holes. If one could get past that, he or she would surely get tripped off on the one-dimensional characters and their stiff, unrealistic dialogue."
2,Should have previewed first,"I must admit that this is one of the best stories I have ever read. It's a hard-to-put down book with much suspense and a lot of surprises all along the way. But the drawback is this: Why did the author have to use the name of the Lord God in vain? I would have considered this a five-star rating but because of the use of God's name in such a way, I have dropped the rating."
3,Predictable,This was the first book in a long time that I almost put down and didn't finish. The story was predictable and the characters were not believable. Overall it was a fast read and somewhat compelling but what could have been a really great story left me disappointed.
2,"A quick, extremely contrived read","I saw that this novel had won the 'Agatha' award for 2006 so I picked it up at the library. Overall, I was disappointed in this read. It starts off well enough with an alluring premise and it's a very quick read but the mystery is very easy to figure out and the many contrivances break the story's back. This is one of those mysteries that completely relies on believing that 'best friends' of years and years and years never talk to each other to sort out a major issue like MURDER. Also, the motivations of the characters are one-dimensional and for the most part don't ring true. I can't imagine most of it really happening. The sad part is that there's a good story here, it's just told badly told. It's like some ridiculous episode of 'Cold Case'."
2,"Great idea, poor execution","This book had a great premise, small town secrets, intrigue, complex family relationships...unfortunately, the juvenile tone and teenage love story stole the show."
3,The Virgin of Small Plains,"I liked the book very much. It was better than okay, well written buta sad story. The ending was a surprise."
3,Insightful,"The more books you read, the more you learn.This book fits that rule if you round your reading off with many more bookson the various subjects regarding Commercial real estate."
1,Not what I thought,"I wasn't impressed with this toy. My 6 yr daughter just had to have it and it ended up being one of those toys that never gets played with. Partly because it quit working like it should, even when new batteries were put in."
4,Great for younger kids,"My three year old got this for Christmas and she just loves it, although I doubt that it will keep her entertained when she gets older. Right now it is one of her favorite toys, but keep in mind that if your younger child likes to pretend to ""feed"" her puppy it will run the risk of getting broken (hers malfunctioned after a Fruit Loop got lodged in it's mouth). One thing that I do like is that the mouth doesn't close hard, as younger children seem to like to stick their fingers in there. Overall she loves this thing, although as a penny-pinching parent I do think it is slightly too expensive and I doubt it will keep her attention when she gets much older."
2,Don't waste your money!,"My SIL bought this as a gift for my 4yr. old. My dd opened it up and thought it was cute. She played with it for about five minutes and got bored. It was difficult to get the pup to smooch by touching its muzzle, and it really doesn't do much. My SIL after a while called it a stupid toy- and she bought it! This is my second experience with a ""Fur real"" toy. My older daughter saved up her own money one year to buy a cat- after warned her against it. She bought it and felt like she wasted her money. Overall, I wouldn't bother with these- it will gather dust."
2,Waiting for parts,When I received this product it had been damaged in shipping. Four of theresin feet were shattered. I called the originating company (A. M. Leonard) and they assured me that they would replace the broken feet. This product was meant to be placed in a sometimes wet location on my patio and thus needs the feet to combat corrosion. I have not received the replacement feetsome weeks later.
2,They are ok... still can't decide if I am going to keep them.,I was a little disappointed. I was hoping for these to fit like the tall over-the-knee boots that are instyle right now. They do go all the way up to mid thigh. I don't find that these are really that tight of boots though. I ordered a size 10 since I am a 9.5 and the whole leg tunnel is loose and bulky. I am not sure what to think of these. They are what they are thigh high costume boots nothing very trendy.
4,Goldfish: a review,This book was great! Very informative and had beautiful pictures. I recomend this book to anyone interested in goldfish or fish keeping in general. No more words can describe how much this book immpressed me. Great job.
2,bad karma,Brown has got to be kidding on this one. Who in their right mind is going to take this seriously?
5,Fun and good,Sneaky Pie's Cookbook for Mystery Lovers is a fun book to read. Good things for our furry friends and fun notes about the books. Good as are all of Rita Mae Browns books.
5,Great Music Never Goes Out of Style,"""Four Boys and a Guitar"" remains the perfect introduction to the Mills Brothers' early recordings. Most of the 1930s classics are here, along with memorable collaborations featuring Duke Ellington, Cab Calloway and Don Redman. Though no longer in print, this Columbia/Legacy CD is worth seeking out."
4,Gripping,"Excellent book, well-written and gripping for the most part. During the climax, I found myself unable to put it down -- something that doesn't usually happen with non-fiction. Spare prose and light touches of very British humor at certain points added to the reading ""pleasure,"" if that's the right word for a work centering on horrific events.I deduct a star for a bit of exaggeration over the climax. From the way it was built up, I thought Lloyd Parry had been involved in something truly horrific. Ultimately, I found his reaction very male and a bit irritating, rather overdone.Overall, though, an excellent book. I hope he plans on writing more."
1,None,i couldnt finish it...i read over 100 books a year and make it a point to get thru them mo matter what...couldnt do it with this one...regardless of how horrible the subject matter was...the material was more appropriate for a news magazine than a book
2,"Unusual, but I don't get it.","After reading all those amazing reviews, I bought this tie as a joke gift to my musician son. Maybe I expected more than what it is. I even thought you could get different notes from different areas of the tie, not a chance. As one reviewer mentioned, it could be great to scare off the raccoons, but that's all it is. Not easy to wear on neck, and the sound it makes could be duplicated by a number of kitchen items. I guess it could be interesting to wear it once or twice in corky occasions."
3,I'm amazed,"I ordered a 28a and a 29a which are supposed to be refillable, they are not, this was misleading to me as I thought they were and advertised as such."
3,okay,"My 4th grader who loves reading didn't think the characters were very well developed and although glad she read it, wouldn't recommend it highly."
2,Melts in heat,"Not sure if it was the location, but I brought this to the middle east to help sell a car, and it warped terribly and almost completely melted the first day in the sun... thought it we be more functional."
2,Disappointing,"I find it difficult to reason the answers to some of the clues. For instance, in Puzzle #85, the clue for 146 across is ""Go at full speed."" The answer is ""Career."" Huh? Is it only me? It seems in many instances that they are making up words to fit the spaces. And the themes are a little too ""clever"" for me. I would not have been able to ascertain what they were looking for in many cases without going to the back for the answers. Perhaps the NY Times is just a little too ""expert"" for me. For my taste, it's just a bit too cutesy. Sorry."
5,Nice Puzzles,I have been doing crosswords for about 40 years. The more difficult they are the better they are. These puzzles are challenging but not impossible to do. Nice way to spend your down time.
2,YUK!,"I know that the Times crosswords are difficult, but this book has such old references, it's just not fun!'s"
2,Not spiral bound as described,"Amazon now has a note on the product that ""there may be something wrong with our inventory"". There is no ""may"", the book is not spiral bound, which was a major selling point. I'm sure the content is fine but the package becomes less attractive as an airplane companion without the spiral binding."
1,Tell the truth,"In the heading for this book, it states emphatically that it is ""spiral bound"" - and several of the comments state that they love the fact it's ""spiral bound"". If any book should be spiral bound, it's a crossword puzzle book. The one I was sent is book bound and will not lay flat, or fold over to provide support when hold it while sitting. I haven't touched any of the puzzles, as I do not take well to be scammed."
3,Good Puzzle Book,"Been doing puzzles for about a year. Just got the New York Times (NYT) puzzle book today. This Sunday puzzle book is a gift for my uncle who has been doing puzzles since the dawn of time! I have looked at a couple of puzzles. As I can fill in some of the entries, I don't consider this the hardest puzzle book out there. Will update once my uncle has an opinion.NYT book is nice looking, easy to use with its spiral binding. It is larger than letter size but due to the number of entries the print is small (one puzzle per page). All in all, a nice gift.UPDATE: It may not be the hardest puzzle book out there but my uncle has worked 2 puzzles and has had to look up some words. I worked one and had to look up 80% of the words!UPDATE 2: My uncle has worked 6 puzzles & they are hard! Perhaps even esoteric."
4,Challenging,This is great for keeping the old mind sharp and working. The puzzles are difficult but not impossible. Clues often not what they appear to be at first read so must keep the mind open to other interpretations. Fun!
3,GREAT PUZZLES,THE PRINT IS TOO SMALL FOR EASY READING BUT OTHERWISE I AM ENJOYING THE BOOKS. I REALLY LIKE THE SPIRAL COVERS BECAUSE THEY ARE EASY TO WORK AND HOLD .
4,Bought them to maintain blood sugar in order,"I bought them to keep my blood sugar in order, I recommend taking these with food and I wouldn't recommend them if you suffer from gastritis or ulcer because they are strong on stomach. There is research that alpha lipoic acid helps keep blood sugar on correct level."
4,good,"I used the book feel very well, but the sequence for the listening is in mass. I cannot find the correct order"
1,wrong book,"I bought this book and received the wrong one. I think it is not fair the return period has expired as I don't live in the states and just picked them up for school. I ordered the correct one and received the ""Preparation Course for the TOEFL test:iBT with ISBN 0-13-205690-9"
3,OK toy,"I got these for my boys, 3 and 5 at the time. Like most of these types of toys, getting the action figures attached to the motercycles is chalangeing to say the least. It didn't take long before they were playing with the cycles and the men separate.The SSP-type pull strings work fairly well. You have to have the cycle very close to the ground and ready to roll when you pull the string. My young boys could not get them to work, but enjoyed playing with the cylcles none the less. Sending them rolling across the floor was probably more fun for me than for them."
2,Nice idea but not as expected,Rip cord broke into 2 pieces before we had a chance to try it out. The motorcycles stop after moving a few feet. Nothing like the old 1970's Evel Knievel motorcycle!
1,Not What It Appears To Be,"This is a book of sheet music from the musical, ""Snoopy"". I thought I was ordering a Snoopy book and was surprised by what I got. This was not clear from the information provided."
5,I miss Living Colour,"It burns me up even today that this band did not stay together and make a decade's worth of music. How glorious that would have been. A truly special band, with an unique sound, a meaningful agenda, and the ability to rock the house. Of all the breakups, this one hurts the most from the 90s. Living Colour was great and this album is a great way to show off their best stuff. Personally, my favorite album is their third one, but I would recommend that if you like what you hear, get all four albums and treat yourself."
3,A Good Single!,"This is a good single w/ a bonus song and a ring tone. IF you like this artist, go get it now."
2,Truly Disappointed,"I was really excited to try this cage out for my 6 lb male maltese. It is a perfect size and it seemed really well made. My dog doesn't really like cages and was able to chew right through the zipper seam. He is NOT aggressive and does not chew things he shouldn't, so to my surprise about a week after my husband and I bought the cage, we found him out of it. We were truly disappointed. It is a cute cage and has a very sturdy frame. If you are not planning on zippering the cage or your dog does not chew through zippered seams, it is a great cage.....but overall, i was disappointed"
3,Pet Crate... went across country,"I purchased two Pet Gear crates for a cross country trip. I loved how the crates went flat and actually fit a tossable kittie litter box in it. My main problem with the crate was that the crate was too easy to bend. Meaning, you could push it forward and the entire crate would list. I have been meaning to contact Pet Gear over it, but haven't so far. I can't find a way to stop it from listing."
2,Have a hot melt glue gun handy,"It assembled easy enough, but top part connection points did not line enough to hold the top on.I needed to use a hot melt glue gun gun to hold to top to the cabinet body. Do not order this unit if you do not have a glue gun."
3,Didn't seem to assemble properly,The assembly took me hours and it didn't quite work out. It still looks odd. I wish there were clearer instructions on how to put it together.
2,Nice cabinet/bad customer service,"I ordered this cabinet and received it very promptly. When putting the cabinet together, I noticed a crack in the side panel. I called the customer service number and was told a replacement would be sent to me. As I continued with the construction of the cabinet I found two more broken pieces. Again, customer service told me replacements would be sent. This all took place in early June. As of this date I have received NO replacement parts. Although, the cabinet is sturdy and certainly fills the need I wanted it for the quality/customer service would prevent me from purchasing from this company again."
4,Suncast products are in most cases as good as Rubbermaid,The price was right and delivered right to my front door. Just follow the directions and they went together without much difficulty.
3,Great size but hard to put together,"Ordered this cabinet because I had a small, narrow space and the size was perfect. Much harder to put together than most of these plastic cab's. Also THE BACK IS JUNK! It's a very thin piece of plastic - really thin! And you are given push pins to secure it - again, garbage. But because the size is so hard to find, I kept it. Not sorry but buyer beware, this is NOT a well-made product."
2,I Ain't Lied Yet,"After recently viewing this DVD, I can't for the life of me see why they call this comedy. I bought this thinking I would really be laughing and it appears that the comedian did more fake laughing than I did. The jokes were really weak and on some he went too far with the jokes (especially the slave segment) I know it's not easy standing in front of a lot of people to tell jokes but it appears that at times this comedian was just throwing stuff together."
4,Lots of helpful info,"This practical resource provides lots of helpful info on taking care of your new baby. It's a good resource for new moms. ---Sheryl Gurrentz, author of ""The Guilt Free Guide to Your New Life as a Mom: Practical ways to take care of yourself, your life, and your baby--all at the same time"""
4,Some info,"Here is the thing.breastfed babies DO NOT NEED anything other than breast milk untill 6 months old.IN MOST CASES formula fed babies can have solids before 6 months.To the woman who said it's not true ,honey go read aap opinions on it.As for bottle fed mothers having to hide.GO ON PREGNANCY WEBSITES FOR GOD SAKE and see how many women are offended for bottle feeding.Formula called rat poison and so on...if you can understand the book maybe you should just read few more...Oh sorry about the voting.i didn't know how did it work.i was voting for the book not my review"
2,Too Technical,"I agree with the previous reviewer. This book is much too technical for the general reader. The author repeatedly uses jargon without any explaination of what it means. I have a background in biological science and like to keep up to date on physical science. I have previously read extensively on string theory, yet I found myself repeatedly adrift in this book wondering what on earth the author was talking about."
5,PRODUCT INFORMATION,"From The Notes On The Box:""Mr Television, Uncle Miltie, Milton Berle--whatever you call him, he is one of the funniest, most beloved comedians of all time. This vintage entertainment from Milton's historic Texaco Star Theater television series features side-splitting comedy routines with some of Hollywood's biggest legends. You'll laugh hysterically at the great visual comedy, including slapstick, wild sight gags and 'Berlesque' scenes with Milton and his guests. It's a laugh a minute for people of all ages. Milton Berle's 'Greatest Moments of Comedy' is an absolute must-have for any video collection.""Features Guest Appearances By:Elvis Presley / Jackie Gleason / Frank Sinatra / Bob Hope / Jack Benny / Dean Martin / Jerry Lewis / Ronald Reagan / Edward G. Robinson / Martha Raye / Red Skelton / Johnny Puleo / Peter Lorre / Nat King Cole / Carmen Miranda / Steve Allen / Phil Silvers / Basil Rathbone / Robert Merrill / Cesar Romero / Lon Chancy, Jr."
2,Not really an introduction,"I expected to find more information about the functionality of a harpsichord in reading this book. First, there are almost no illistrations which makes it hard to picture what their talking about, and the majority of the book is filled with music and how to play. Perhaps a good book for someone who already knows how to play piano and understands how a harpsichord works, but not for someone just getting into the piece."
2,Short version disappointing.,"I purchased ""i know a rose tree"" by ""secret garden"" from this album, because it is a very beautiful song and very hard to find without purchasing costly imports. My recommendation... buy a costly import. This song is literally chopped off at 3:00 with a bad fade. While the rest sounds great (as great as a 256kbps mp3 can sound) the full song is about 5:00. That's 2:00 of song cut off, and the portion cutoff is the climactic joining of all the instruments and vocals together. Bummer.p.s. check out imeem.com to hear the whole song legally for free."
1,Awful!!!,"My daughter is a big fan of Teletubbies and I must say that it's pretty entertaining for kids. Kids love repetition and colors. One thing I hate about teletubbies is when Tinky-Winky carrying and dancing around with a red purse!!! What in the world is he doing? Isnt Tinky Winky a boy? My daughter even asked me that same question!! Pls can anyone tell me. It gives a very bad example to kids implying that homosexuality is a normal behavior. They should not show this episode EVER to kids!!! I highly agree with the other mom's review that teletubbies should not promote homosexuality. The world is already complicated, let's not make it more complicated."
2,UK version only,"We love Shaun the Sheep, but this DVD is stored in UK format, which mean it likely will not play on US machines. We got through it by playing the DVD in a Mac, but beware. Had we know about the formatting, we would not have bought the DVD."
5,Indispensable Volume!,This Anthology is essential for anyone interested in the long and complex history of interracial literature. It is thorough and comprehensive while pointing the way to often neglected texts of world literature. Anyone interested in one period of interracial encounter would benefit from this survey tracing the literary depiction of and response to the frought history of black-white contact. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!
3,fast shipping,"I was looking for more information on AVM, not a list of sources on where to find information. My fault for not researching book better, book in good condition with fast shipping"
1,DISAPPOINTED,The pooh rocking chair was a special request by our 2 year old for Xmas 2008. It is very aesthetically appealing however it is not comfortable... no curves in seat like Lakeshore rockers for tots. It is high for a tot. My daughter is tall and her legs dangle. Lastly and most disappointing one of the top finials just snapped off...jagged splintered edges and all. My daughter doesn't use the chair much... very disappointed.
2,Poor quaility,"The quality is just fair. The peddels kept coming unscrewd, the rims were bent when they arrived, the tires had holes in them, I had to tighten the handle bars every couple of weeks. The only reason I give it 2 stars is because the training wheels held up well, but other than that, I would pass on this bike."
5,Great bike for the price,I purchased this bike for my son when he was 4. He is now 9 and doesn't ride it anymore. This bike has never given me any problem other than the training wheels wore out as my son rode the bike so much. The bike is very good quality considering it was not made in the USA. I would highly recommend this bike to anyone looking for a first bike for a kid. My son is now riding a geared mountain bike and still occasionally asks if he can ride his baby bike. It is funny to see him on the bike now but is is still holding up. I think it is time to donate it to goodwill.
5,Driving madness...,"If you're familiar with Joe Morris, than you can expect this to be a little more focused and driving than some other recordings. Don't worry though, this is still the typical Joe Morris madness that we know and love. I really like the bass and drums, I think these are some guys that Morris hasn't recorded with before. This cd is limited to 3000 I think, after that it will be out of print forever I suppose. Buy it..."
1,incoherent raving,"rather typical pseudo-stream-of-consciousness from one I suspect lacks experience, and so, invents it. no surprises here."
2,Sounds like original recording,"I had hoped that the recording on CD would have been cd quality. Instead it sounds as if they took the original recording and placed it on the cd. Could stand a little remixing to enhance the quality of the sound.Don't get me wrong the music is great, just difficult to hear clearly."
5,Excellent!,"This is a great recording and a welcome surprise for me in 2002! Mary goes through the whole history of jazz in 13 tunes. You can hear spirituals, ragtime, Kansas City Swing and bop. If you want to know what swing is all about just listen to this recording. It's almost impossible to keep your head from swinging and bopping. I enjoyed her beautiful rendition of ""It Ain't Necessarily So"", a slow tune where you can really feel the blues. Her playing of ""St. Louis Blues"" is well worth the price of the CD, she tears the piano up. I wish I was there back in 1977."
5,The Piano Mother,"I bought this cd because I already had an old LP version of Williams' solo recital from the Montreux Jazz Festival, 1978. This recording is even better, with Ms Williams working up a piano trio frenzy on blues, boogie woogie and standards, as well as some of her own tunes. The material is excellent, and the performance is tight, swinging, harmonically complex, and the whole thing maintains an incredible down-home feeling. Hearing this live recording makes me wish that I had been there myself...or that I had an extra grandmother this hip."
4,A Live Album,Here is an opportunity to hear Mary Lou live with Larry Gales on bass ( Monk's bass player) and Eddie Marshall on bass. Recorded not long before she died this is Mary Lou sounding sharp and as fresh as ever and I recommend this highly. Anyone interested in the history of jazz shoud also read her biography by Linda Dahl.Pilgarlic
2,it really isnt like the picture,"It really isnt like the picture, fits the phone but it is not what you scpect to receive"
4,Great case,"Love this product. It works much better than the armband case I had before. Plastic part is infavorable, because I'll have to buy another one (as it took very little effort getting out my car to snap the clip off). But for the price, it's totally worth it for the price you're paying. Would pay a little more for metal, if available."
4,a little disappointed,"For the price, its a pretty good case. Sadly, my phone was a little too big for the case. Its a tight snug but it works. They also delivered it right away. i was pretty impressed."
5,Awesome headphones,"These are great headphones which are super comfortable. I hardly notice they are on, and I wear glasses with them. The retractable cord is great since they make it very portable and it never gets tangled up. The music is good for a pair of headphones I say it's about medium quality. The bass isn't as good as with my earbuds, but I know I can't expect as much from cheaper headphones. Anyways try these out I got a few of these as spares."
2,The item doesn't match the picture.,"I like the old style in the picture, but received a newer version that's far from the photo and runs small. It works, but I prefer the the old style. Neither style lasts longer than one or two soccer seasons."
4,"A great game, but no Jason Alexander","Not a bad game, and very well done as most older style Lucasarts games were (such as Day of the Tentacle, and Sam & Max). I really enjoyed playing it, if just for the adventure. A lot of the other character voices used were pretty well on, but the Duckman voice actor was definately not Jason Alexander. Still worth a play, and a fun piece of memorabilia from the show if you can find it."
5,Keeping the standard high,"It was a long time ago since I purchased the first volume of the Baltic Voices series with Paul Hillier and the Estonian Philharmonic Chamber Choir; it was thus with great enthusiasm that I purchased Vol. 2, and my expectations were enthusiastically met. I can wholeheartedly second reviewer J D Wilder's positive review, and would recommend any person who appreciates choral music in all its forms to obtain this CD.My favorites are the Winter Hymn, the Grigorjeva and the Schnittke selections, though the other tracks featured on this disc deserve acclaim just as much, if only for the fact that the choir performs indefatigably throughout! If you are looking for choir music that emulates a variety of moods and never really ceases to be ethereal and relaxing, I highly recommend this CD. And if you have started with Vol. 1 of the series, the purchase of this CD is practically not up for debate."
2,Crap,"The ant banks track is $hit house on this, but Dont come faulty and Oakland are quite catchy. The rest of the album is fu(ked"
3,These re-recordings are a bit too sweet.,"While it's nice to hear the late, great John Barry's themes in crystal-clear CD sound, the truth is that these re-recordings have none of the subtle production of the originals and are much too goosed up on the chimes, dulcimers, and strings. Barry was the master of introducing themes with great subtlety but powerful emotion -- unfortunately, the conductor and musicians on this compilation decided to slather it on pretty thick. Just listen to the strings on the theme from ""The Quiller Memorandum"" or the herky-jerky slow movements from the ""Walkabout"" theme for examples."
3,Something Different,"The Reappeance of Sam Webber is an outstanding book that captures the life of a boy growing up in the suburban side of Baltimore where the buildings are rundown, muggers have guns and not even your trash can (rubbish bin) is safe.Although the ending of the book could have been improved, I still think it is a good read. Not the most earth shattering book of all time, but if your looking for something different I think you'll enjoy it.Arthur's Raiting: 3 1/2 stars"
2,An Interesting Novel,"The Reappearance Of Sam Webber portray's the events of an eleven year old boy as he comes face to face with loss, racism and forgiveness.I think this novel is most suited to young adults and grown ups as i found it hard as a teenager to stay focussed, as there did not seem to be any climax's apart from getting mugged in a chapter and getting picked on.The book did have very good discriptive passages though but i think it would be better suited to a short story or poetry book."
2,The Reappearance of Sam Webber,"The reapearance of sam webber wasnt very interesting i thought. i didnt enjoy reading it at all. everything that he did seemed to be repeated over and over again. like he went to tha 7 11 with greely and he had hamburgers for lunch, im suprised he didnt put on a few extra kilo's for all those hamburgers he ate. Or he went to play catch tha footy with greeley. yay.so over all i didnt like the story. The book was just not that exciting."
3,The Reappearance of Sam Webber by Phoebe,"'The Reappearance of Sam Webber' makes you think. It generates thoughts about friendship, family, racial differences and life in general. The book is about Little Sam, whose father has left, his mother is having a breakdown, and he feels alone and friendless. Sam is a victim of bullying and then Greely, intervenes and Sam's life starts to improve. Greely,an older dark skinned janitor, becomes both a friend and a protector. Sam is no longer alone.This debut novel from Jonathon Scott Fuqua plays with your emotions, at one stage making you laugh, and at the next, you may even shed a tear.It is a realistic look at everyday American life in the city of Baltimore."
5,Reading that reveals beauty in life,The Reappearance of Sam Webber is an outstanding book that offers a great message of life. Sam's struggles in life are realistic and ominous at times. The growth of his character displays outstanding insight by the author Joanthon Fuqua. As an at-risk counselor in public education this book has been offered as suggested reading to many students. The message is clear.....the themes and ideas of the book are an inspiration. Fuqua's ability to paint a picture in the reader's mind is refreshing. What a blessing it is to have books such as The Reappearnce of Sam Webber available to our society.
3,the reappearance of sam webber,"this novel tells the tale of an eleven year old boy,small and shy whose father has abandonned him. Along with his depressed mother they go broke and are forced to move to a rough inner city town. Being shy Sam makes no friends, except for the old school janitor.Through being with the janitor Sam comes out of his shell and learns alot of important values about life.He learns that family doesn't have to be blood related, that the people around him who support him and his mum are just as good as family. maybe even better."
3,The Reappearance of Sam Webber,"Sam Webber is a ordinary boy in an ordinary world until his life is turned upside down when his father leaves.From the lovely neighbourhood of rodger forde to the rough area of Charles Village Sam thinks he'll never be happy again,until he gains a rare friendship with the school janitor. With the help of his new friend and a few other important people,Sam overcomes the struggles that are placed before him and realises life goes on.."
2,The Reappearance of Sam Webber,This story is about a young boy who has to overcome many difficult hurdles in his life when his dad goes missing and the only thing that he left behind was his car and memories.He is confronted with lots of struggling challenges such as;Overcoming the loss of his fatherFitting in to is new neighbourhood and schoolGetting friendsAnd cheering up his depressed mum.All in all it was an ok book that could have been a bit better.I WOULD give it 2 1/2 stars out of 5.
2,The Dissapearance of Sam Webber,"This is a meloncholy story of one boys struggle with life after his father leaves. It is a story full of realistic characters, dreary settings and a look at the darker side of Maine and all of this... did absolutely nothing to intruige me.It is an amazing tale of overcoming obstacles which is nothing like my usual war/ horror novel tastes.Advisable if you are after a moving read, but if you are older than twelve and younger than twenty with no taste, stay well clear."
2,the reaperance of sam webber,I can't say that this is the best book that i have ever red but it isn't the worst either. It has a reasonable story line but i think that it drags on to longe. there isn't enoughexitment in the book. I t's just the day in the life of Sam. A few exiting things happen in the book and it does send out a powerfull message but i'd say you'd either like it or hate it so each to their own.
2,The Reappearance Of Sam Webber,"Although this book is very well written, I disliked the content and the way that the author portrayed his story. This book may have been true to life but it was depressing and a hard book to commit to. I would not buy this book."
2,An Interesting Novel,"""The Reapearence of Sam Webber"" portrays the events of an eleven year old boy as he travels through the journey of life. He experiences many new friendships and emotions which help him survive what seems to be the worst circumstances.The book had good discriptive passages but I think it would have been best suited to a short story or poetry book. Overall I feel the book is more for adults as I found it hard as a teenager to stay focussed on the storyline because the only climaxes seemed to be Sam getting bullied and and mugged."
4,Big Sam - Little Sam,"The Reappearance of Sam Webber was a very well written book which i did enjoy reading. The author told the story very very well and you could really feel for Sam, sometimes it even felt like Sam was a real person because of how much i could understand how he was feeling. It also shows clearly throughout the novel how much Sam matures after the disappearance of his father. I really think you should take the time to read this novel."
2,the reappearance of sam webber,"i thought ""the reappearance of sam webber"" was a satisfactory book. it didn't have any great highlights to it and the ending wasn't very strong because i was waiting for sams dad to come home or something more exciting than how it did end. there were some good points to the book about racism and the troubles of a teenage kid but apart from that it wasn't very enjoyable."
2,The Reappearance Of Sam Webber,"When Sam's father disappear, Sam and his mum has to move out of their nice town to a rough city. Sam had a very hard time by handling his school life and scare of what's new surround him. He also has to cope with his depressed mother and also had to put up with a kid his age bullied him at school.But things are changed when Sam meet his school janitor name Greely, they become a close friends, and learns about each others life and learn to accept it."
2,The Reappearance of Sam Webber,"The reapearance of sam webber was not the best book i have read.i found tha everything he did was repeated over and over again. like one day he went to the 7 11 with greely, and sam had hamburgers. i am suprised he didnt put on a few extra kilos with all the hamburgers he ate. he would go there one day and be there again the next. or he went to catch the footy with greely.there was some good points about things like racism, and bully's and depression which was good. But i didnt enjoy the book and i didnt find it very interesting."
5,LOVE IT...ENJOY IT....READ IT!!!!!,I really enjoyed this book for numerous reasons of my own. It is a GREAT story to read and keeps your attention making it hard to put down. I highly suggest this book to everyone.
3,the reapearance of sam webber,i think that this book has an good story but in parts it can get a bit boring. it is a good book showing yound people that when there is a problem it can always be sorted out. just like sam when his dad went that ended up with a new family and they were happy.
2,Done deal,Didn't like it much. It was confusing and you couldn't get a clear understanding. It kept bouncing around Its one of his first books I wouldn't recommend.
2,There are better belts out there,"I installed two of these belts on my 6-foot finish mower which is pulled by a 45 HP tractor. I was mowing grass that probably should have been cut with a bush-hog rather than a finish mower, but within 15 minutes of first use, both belts had rolled over in the pulleys and ran on their side rather than within the normal ""V"". This caused them to overheat and jump off the pulley, which allowed one of them to wrap under the mower and get cut. I replaced both belts with Kevlar wrapped belts and haven't had any problems since, even in the severe-duty use that I subjected them to."
5,Why Do Good Things Have to End?!,"This is a great series, and I really wish they would do more, and resolve some of the relationships that are left hanging in the balance...What happened Showtime? There was so much more to explore with her character? For instance, what does happen when her ""assets"" devalue? Does she settle down to a ""suburban hell"", in her case, become a Madame like Stephanie, or does she get a REAL job?Bad call on the part of Showtime dropping this for shows like ""Californication"", ""Shameless"" and ""House of Lies"". At least Belle is endearing and has redeeming qualities."
2,Stupid Finale,"Every season of this show was super amazing and good, except the final season. It was awful. Hannah becomes just a horrible person (was she always a bad person?) and in the end (spoiler alert) chooses her career over any semblance of a real life. Was I the only one that didn't see that coming?"
4,happy,hopeful season 3 will work its in the mail so i am waiting overall response packaging and product seem to be adequate
4,Poor Quality but DAUGHTER LOVES IT!,"I've read the other reviews... it does have VERY poor quality. I have 1 leg that constantly falls off, the stethoscope and blood pressure keep falling apart - this is all easily fixable but quite annoying. Anyway, my daughter still adores it. I wouldn't take it back despite all the drawbacks. She plays with it constantly every single day. It does deliver great imaginative play so isn't that all that matters? As long as she doesn't complain about it always falling apart, (she'll just come get to me fix it... no big deal) I say it's a keeper. I will keep my eye out for a more expensive sturdier baby checkup center and replace it with the existing one."
3,"My daughter loves this, so I put up with it!","Yes, the thing comes apart easily (my daughter has removed the legs herself so she could play with the top on the floor). Yes, several of the accessories are cardboard, and they have ended up in the garbage. Our scale doesn't stay on well but, since it gets taken off anyway, I don't care. What I do care about is that my 3-year-old LOVES this thing. Her babies get 'owwies' all the time and they often need checkups. I took the cardboard back off the table and she hangs baby's clothes and blankets there while they are checked out.No, I wouldn't have bought the thing if I knew how cheaply it was made. However, I honestly think it was a good investment when I see how much my child enjoys it."
2,2 Thumbs Down...Poor Quality....Don't waste your money,"My 3 year old just got this for her birthday today. Boy what a dissapointment. My parents bought it in AZ and had it shipped all the way to Iowa for her. As soon as I took it out of the box and started to assemble it, I knew this wasn't going to last. The legs do not attach at all making it very unstable and unsafe. I've had to take most of the pieces away from my daughter because they are very small and could easily be swallowed. Several parts are made of cardboard. Poor Quality all around for the amount of $$ my parents paid and I will be calling fisher price to let them know!!!!:("
2,WASTE OF MONEY,"My 3 year old daughter got this for her birthday. It looked like fun but after getting it put together it lasted all of 1/2 hour. The legs feel off, it was a pain to get together in the first place. Nothing about this toy stayed together for very long. My 9 month old had the Blood pressure checker and the Stethoscope toren apart in to many pieces before they had much of a chance to even play with them. It is a total waste of time and money. If I were to do it over agian I wouldn't have even opened the box we would have retured it asap."
1,POOR QUALITY,"I bought this Dr. table for my 4 year old daughter. She played with it the first day and that is all! I was very disappointed in the quality of this product. The legs fall off, the scale is hard to remove and replace, the backing is made of cardboard, and not big enough for the average doll! Overall, you would be much better off to buy a cheap Dr. kit because the table is worthless."
3,DONT BUY THIS,This toy is very poorly made and the legs kept falling off. This toy is not worth the money.
2,"It's nice, but very flimsy","I bought this for my daughter's 2nd birthday. She loved it at first, but not even 5 minutes after putting it together, she pretty much had it torn up. The legs came off very easily. She had taken apart the stethescope and the blood pressure cuff. I was very disappointed in this product. I have bought other little mommy stuff and was very pleased with them. I probably won't be buying anymore little mommy stuff that has legs!"
1,Save your money!,This item is so poorly made! Every 5 minutes my girls (6 and 3.5 years old) were yelling for me to fix it. It would be a great toy IF it was made better. As it is - it's just not worth it.
1,Would give it 0 stars if I could,"This is absolutely the worst Little Mommy Toy ever. The legs are always coming off, and I keep trying to jam it into it's spot back in. Gladly I don't own it, but I was playing with it at my little neighbor's house. She has it, and the legs keep coming off, and the little girl is only 3, and she can't handle that!! I felt sorry for her when she started wailing because it didn't work. Trust me, do not buy this toy unless you want to dissapoint your daughter!!!!!!!Sincerely,Carrot"
3,toy falls apart,"I bought this for my 3 year old, and she loves this toy. The bad thing is that she is always bringing me different parts to put back together. From the moment we opened the box we realized how poor this toy was made. Every piece falls apart. Her babies are always falling in the floor when the legs come off. That makes a 3 year old mad. I think the toy needs to go back in the shop. It has great potential though."
1,Falls apart,I could not even see this toy for $5 on Craigslist or at a garage sale after we got sick of it falling apart. It is 100% not worth the price. I do NOT recommend it.
4,Little Mommy toys have been a joy for my little girl !!,"Our daughter has all the my little mommy toys and baby dolls.This little mommy check up center made by Fisher Price has made her so happy. She loves playing doctor, and all of the accessories are safe and durable for a chid over two.She has been playing with this toy since she got it for her Birthday,and nothing has broke off or come lose. We love my Little Mommy toys and Fisher Price. Thank You !!"
1,Poor service,"When I got the book it was just a partial book. I contacted the seller, but they refused to send a complete book. I wanted it for my family history work."
3,nice,"i was thinking that i would like this CD a little more. kind of gets old after a couple of songs, but it is still calming as background music."
5,Unique and beautiful,"I have had this watch for over 3 years now, I love it. It goes with everything, (particularly my Cape Cod Jewlery) is dressy and casual. Many people comment on this watch when they see it. I paid full price for this watch and would pay it again, so this $110 sale price makes it a steal."
5,Excellent,"Very nice watch, fast delivery, good price, glad to make business with Amazon and will not hesitate to make some more.Louise"
4,bello,"Me encanta super delicado, a pesar de no tener los puntitos que marcan los minutos, me hace falta porque no veo la hora con minutos y seguntos"
2,Synopis,The kids new teacher is out of the ordinary. All she likes to to do is eat. Eat children that is...
3,Synopis:,"As Collin and Janet go to school, there is a new teacher that's not just your average teacher. It's your average creature..."
4,My review,This book is pretty good and I liked it.It is not a book for a Nobel price but I raccomand it to you.I enjoyed reading it and it is pretty scary. P.s.:This bbook is OK!
4,Sweet!,"Well-produced album with thoughtfully considered transitions and song structure, KMotiv puts out beats you could rap with or play in the background while you chill with your friends. Worthy of more than a couple listens."
5,the great need of the church,"This book by Carson deals with the great need of the church today:following the example of Paul in Christ, a command to all believers stated many times and in many ways to all believers in the word of God. This book, perhaps more than any other study of Pauline theology or his writings, exposes the goal of a true servant of God: the meekness and kindness of Christ, with a God-infused desire to obey Christ, to suffer for Christ and to boast in Christ and His word for His glory alone. YOU MUST BUY THIS BOOK AND READ IT FROM COVER TO COVER. GET ON YOUR KNEES AND PRAY THROUGH IT; YOU MUST TRUST GOD THROUGH HIS SPIRIT TO TEACH YOU IF YOU WANT TO BE USED OF HIM FOR HIS GLORY AND NOT FOR SELF. MAY THE LORD SEND FORTH HIS SERVANTS, WILLING TO SUFFER FOR HIS SAKE, TO TAKE COMFORT IN HIM AND HIS WORD ALONE."
3,Song????,"This movie did not have the usual ""Follow that Dream"" song during the opening credits. Thats one of the best parts of the movie. Im not sure why another song was put on the CD but I would rather have the song supposed to be on it."
3,Great Movie - HORRIBLE DVD,"This is one of my favorite Elvis movies. It's funny, corny, and has some good songs. I like it best because it's FUNNY.What's NOT funny is the quality of the DVD itself. I can't begin to tell you how BAD the transfer is. I have seen better quality on regular TV, many many times, and the quality of THIS DVD should make the people who made it hide their heads in SHAME!The Movie gets 5 stars...... The DVD gets ONE (only because I couldn't give 1/2 stars, so the average is my rating of THREE. You would probably get better quality recording it on video tape off regular TV.;"
1,Pan and Scan??!?!?!,I hope this is not the trend. Pan and scan for a CinemaScope picture? It came out wide screen on laser.I certainly hope that was a typo. I won't buy it if it is P&S; and neither should you.I guess I will have to transfer my laser copies to DVD.
1,Why not WWWWide SSSSScrean!!!!!!!!!,It's 2004 and MGM is still butchering wide screen movies.For the minority who don't like seeing the whole movie. Use the zoom feature on your DVD player and crop the movie to your heart's delight.
1,"Pan & Scan, R U Joking?!",MGM should hide under a hole for releasing this film in Full Frame as opposed to Widescreen!!! I will NOT be buying this release! Wake up MGM!!!
2,Great movie. Lousy MGM cost cutting,"This is one of my favorite Presley films, one I have been looking forward to getting on DVD. Now MGM has produced the disc, but sadly made the cost-cutting decision to revert to the bad old days of non-anamorphic widescreen. For those of you not familiar with what this means, it means after you get a widescreen TV, this DVD will give you 33% less vertical resolution than would an enhanced (anamorphic widescreen) DVD. I.e., a relatively lousy picture.Shame on you, MGM."
4,A fun elvis flick,"One of the better Elvis movies. He was charming, the scenery was good. The supporting cast was fun. All in all a fun, feel good movie."
2,Only 2 stars because it's not Anamorphic,"There are a lot of complaints from people who thought this DVD would not be widescreen, however,no one has mentioned it is not Enhanced For Widescreen T.V.'s. MGM is releasing a lot of films this way to save money. If this bothers you as it does me then send an email to MGM.I really like this movie but am very disappointed with the format. When you have a widescreen T.V. in the future you'll curse MGM."
1,Full Screen format!!!,"What is the point of releasing this film in full screeen format only. It's theatrical aspect ratio was 2.35:1 - i have the widescreen edition on Laserdisc, so it does exist.what a major disappointment - come on MGM get with it!!Anthony"
2,"Chambers reads well, but no cigar","I bought the Chambers Dictionary of Etymology, largely based on reviews posted here. While I love the 'prose' style of word origin discussions, there has scarcely been a time the book has proved useful. The fact is, Eric Partridge's ""Origins"" : a Short Etymological Dictionary of Modern English"" surpasses Chambers on a daily basis for my purposes. It goes deeper, gives you a wealth of threads for further investigation and contains some spicy asides regarding other distionaries. That one needs to familiarize oneself with abbreviations is simply no objection.My view is : by-pass Chambers and get a real etymological dictionary. You will never regret it. I have a pristine copy of Chambers for sale should you incline to the contrary."
3,Good but incomplete,"The dictionary is good and reasonably complete, at least much better than the (American) Barnhart dictionary. The explanations are good and work back to the oldest equivalents up to Sanskrite. But many antiquated words are missing. Also all wordt with a pornographic or scatological meaning are conspicuously absent, even though much used in common language and often of clear Alglo-Saxon origin. Censorship has certainly marred this book."
2,No better than a good dictionary.,"To my surprise I found this book to be no better than my 50 year old Webster Collegiate Dictionary. About the same number of roots, similarly presented."
5,monster of loch ness,I just finished reading this book. It was very interesting and entertaining. This is for anyone who might or might not believe in the Loch Ness Monster.
5,Great way to leave couch-potato-dom behind,"I'm very happy with this workout. I was extremely out of shape when I started and even the basic 1-2 workouts wiped me out. Within a week or 2, I was ok, and progressed to the advanced workout at about week 4-5. The time commitment, about 40 minutes 6x/week was very reasonable, and Tony keeps you going even when you're having an off day and just not quite as good as you were the day before. I'm considering the p90x now, but happy with the ""masters series p90"" workouts in the interim."
4,As expected,Nothing to fancy about the subwoofer cable. It works better than the composite cables I was using. And it came as expected when expected.
5,A Monster of a cable...,Cable was as advertised. I was able to save a bunch of money by buying it from Amazon rather then one of the big box stores.
4,Awesome!,"I don't really hear the difference between this and my dish network A/V cable. Maybe it's just my setup.All i can say is it works, feels like quality material, the connectors fit snug on my sub and receiver, and it's nice and long!Definitely buy!If interested my setup is:Receiver: Sony STR-DN1010Subwoofer: Energy ESW-8HG (double subs)Speakers: Klipsch HD 500 (satellites only)"
5,Completely eliminates subwoofer hum.,"Regular RCA cables can cause a loud hum from a subwoofer, even if it's not receiving a signal from your amp/receiver. This special cable removes that hum. It's directional so you have to install it properly and then you can enjoy your subwoofer."
5,monster cable monster bass,Great subwoofer beats paying $60 dollars for this cable at best buy or radio shack. Great quality subwoofer sounds great.
5,Wonderful Watch,"I received this watch as a Christmas gift from my aunt. It is beautifully crafted and has worked flawlessly. The automatic winding is a great feature as long as you wear it every day (which I do) and it only stopped ticking once when I broke my arm and couldn't wear it. The only bother is when a month has less than 31 days you have to take some time to reset the date. And to those who say the ""month"" dial doesn't work I believe it is only a standard clock layout for your reference. Bottom Line - Great Buy at Great Price[...]"
3,Not quite what we expected,"The costume is cute but the material is extremely thin. If it is a cold Halloween-she will be uncomfortable. The wings will need some help to stay up and the wand (although it says is included) was not included. We are awaiting a reply from the company about this issue. The costume is the closest to the real thing though. Unless we get the wand shipped to us, the cost if this costume with its high shipping cost did not make it worth getting the costume. We will update the review if/when the wand issues is resolved."
1,Really Boring,"This whole series could use a makeover. There's no offbeat stuff to do in it, all pretty standard guidebook touristy stuff that suits upscale pocketbooks. Two cool books written by locals who live there that I ended up using were the Lonely Planet San Francisco book and Golden Gate Trailblazer. A good combo. I wanted an inside look, frank opinion, places to get out and hike, alternative culture and I got it."
5,"Tower City Is an Excellent Band, Check them Out.","Tower City was formed by ex New Monkees member Larry Saltis. This is the second CD in the bands discography. This is just as good if not better than their first CD A Little Bit Of Fire. In the vein of Def Leppard and Giant, this CD is excellent from beginning to end. You will not find a filler and the musicianship is top notch. If you have not heard of this band go and buy their 2 CD's, you will not be disappointed. If you like bands like Alias, Bad English, Giant, Michael Morales, Def Leppard, Bon Jovi and great AOR make this your next purchase."
4,Practical and Straightforward. Good diary for lean consultants,"I have a number of lean books in my library--most of which are fairly solid on presenting the lean philosophy, principles and tools. All the concepts here are straightforward--very clearly presented. If you were going to launch your first lean event into an organization that is unfamiliar with lean--this would be my choice because Carreira is so practical. His background is consulting, so his chapters read like a diary (Day 1, Day 2, Day 3 etc.)for a lean implementation. He has seen a number of companies and draws from past experiences: he knows what works and how to avoid the pitfalls to achieve bottom line results. Lean is a philosophy and the biggest gains will be in the ""buy-in"" in the organization. From his easygoing demeanor, you can see why he has succeeding as a consultant--is humor and demeanor disarms the fear of change and fosters team participation. This is a good buy and a good start point for applying lean. Good luck."
4,Taught me a few things,Now I have a few things to say when a job interviewer asks what do I know about Lean Manufacturing. I have been out of Mfg. for seven years and I needed to brush up on things. Read other reviews for more in depth data.
2,Erotica?,"I found this book to be disappointing. I'm all for a little casual sexual encounter, but I just didn't buy the characters being together - sexually or otherwise. It seemed they each had a Frankenstein sense of personality - pieced together to fit whatever situation in which the author wanted to place them.It almost seemed like a porn book written by a man - where women just have sex whenever and whereever they choose and aren't, in the least, impacted by emotion, judgement or real life.Just couldn't enjoy it because I've never known any women that would make the same decisions these did."
4,Real Family Cooking,"I received this cookbook a couple of weeks ago and enjoyed reading it, and picking out recipes to try. the recipes look easy, the ingredients i either have or are readily accessible, real life recipes, for real life people. i especially liked the side comments. it's as if a family member is standing in your kitchen reminiscing with you. the recipes are well laid out, easy to read, the line drawings are charming. my own personal prejudice:i prefer books like this to be spiral bound so they lie flat as i'm following a recipe. but since each recipe is complete on one page, it's easy enough to use a bookholder. somehow this is the type of cookbook that you know will be used often, passed on in the family and will probably be splattered with bits of ingredients. :-) i would have also enjoyed seeing pictures of the finished product, but these 2 comments are only minor faults if even that. it's a book to read, cook from, and share."
5,"Fun, Easy, and Quick",This is my most often used cookbook in my collection. Its layout is great for my family as I teach my younger children to bake. It provides dialog for setting our own family traditions with baking. The recipes are noted for skill and time too. Quick & Easy is my favorite. It reminds me of good ole grandma's cooking and I love the opportunity to pass that down to my children! If you don't purchase this cookbook your missing out.
3,Too Little about Too Much,"1992. A minor edition in this excellent series in my opinion. Not-so-scenic scenery and just a little bit about a lot of things from Edinburgh to the Isle of Skye. Forth Bridge, Perth, glass blowing, Highland games, a distillery, Blair Castle, Inverness, Lock Ness, Caldonian Canal--on and on but with only a moment or less to spare on each subject. The use of two narrators--one male, one female--makes it seem like two films have been spliced into one and it irritates the ear. (Obviously transferred from tape, my DVD copy has an annoying flicker between scenes every now and then.) Sorry to be negative, but that is the way it is."
2,Just as expected.,"I ordered this item believing that it would probably require drilling, welding, bending, and that I would need to run a #12 wire directly from the battery to the spreader motor. It did not let me down as it required all of the above."
5,A mandatory book for ecologist,"This book has help me a lot during my career. It has a excellent discussion of many useful tools for biologists & ecologist (indices, models, etc.) that bring clues for successful analyzes and ecological interpretations. Good tool either for beginners and more advance fellows."
5,Nice starting point,"This book offers an excellent review of the ecological approaches to understanding diversity and abundance data, and has several figures that can be useful for teaching."
4,Bloomin terrific!,"Fur plump buds in the outdoors, this is the stuff. Don't over use. Regular dosage will lower your ph to around 5.5 to 6.0 from neutral water. So no need to ad acid when using. My dogs try to drink it! Must be some good s***!"
4,An EXCELLENT resource,"I am an adoptive Father of a (now) 6 year old girl and in the two years since she and her brothers moved in I started to realize how completely lost I was. As I watched her grow and be shaped by the world around us I knew I needed some good, solid, real-world advice. Knowing that the author has raised/is raising 6 Daughters went a long way towards meeting that, ""real-world"" criteria!Addressing a vast number of areas - some you'd expect, (helping to create positive friendships, communication), and others you wouldn't, (being politically aware/active) - he serves up doses of both common sense and sometimes surprising advice.Although at 6 my Daughter is still a bit too young for some of what I read, I feel I will be a better Father for having read this book. I intend to keep it around and go back to it for gentle reminders as I need them."
5,Great gift adn resource for Dads of Daughters!,My church purchased this book to give to the dads of girls in our church who are in the 4th through 8th grade. We have had an excellent response to the book. It's easy to read and provides great wisdom from a well-experienced dad/author. So thankful to have found this book!
1,Should have warning signs,"As you probably see, this book is not for everybody. If you want to raise daughters to be free, open-minded beings, this book can only be read as a handbook on what not to do. Chapters devoted to tricking girls into religious beliefs, and how to keep them conservative and away from feminism are among the highlights. I guess a book like this could never be published in Norway, and I hope indoctrination like this do not get too broad an audience.I honestly bought it to get advice for my family, and feel ripped off."
5,Get This Book,"An Amazing book, highly recommend for both fathers and mothers on a unique way to raise your children to be healthy and whole. Good for both sons and daughters. Chapter 4 is amazing. Want your child physically and emotionally whole when they marry? Get this book."
4,well worth reading,"The book offers many good thoughts on raising daughters. Although the book is overtly Christian, an open-minded non-Christian might benefit as well.The only thing keeping the book from a 5-star rating is that the author frequently amplifies one experience with one girl into a principle with broad application. Sometimes this practice works well, but other times it struck me as a stretch."
4,It's okay,The killer suprised me. I really couldn't get into Stine's head in this book. Its good but not his best.
5,Edge of your seat suspense.,"Reva Dalby is a snotty rich girl who's father owns a department store, Dalby's. Her cousin Pam isn't as rich as her so Reva treats her like dirt. Soon Reva is getting threatening presents. What does all this mean? Pam and here friends Clay and Mickey have come up with the perfect plan to get her back. Will it work? Find out when you read the book."
3,good read,was disappointed reva was still the same brat as the pervious book but it was enjoyable. i liked seeing her frightened and being surprised by who the murder really was.
3,"""Silent Night"" shoudn't even qualify as a thriller.","I read ""Silent Night"" and I didn't like it very much. I didn't think it was very mysterious because it is so easy to figure out who the killer is a couple of chapters into the book. There were a couple of moments where you were wondering what was going to happen but most of the book wasn't thrilling at all. I kind of liked Reva's character a little bit, though. I thought that she actually had a reason for being such a jealous, stuck-up, spoiled brat. If you read this book you will be surprised at some things at the end but you'll probably be able to figure out who the killer is before you're supposed to."
5,This book is such a good one!,I have read a few R.L Stine books and I can say this one is probably my favorite. I suggest reading it in November or December so that it will get you in the holiday mood. It's a very easy read with a good ending. I have also read all of the sequels and I really like this one!
3,Decent Holder,I bought this to replace a lost Sun Mt umbrella Speedcart II holder tube. Kit includes the full hardware to mount to the handle. I hope Sun Mt sees what advances Bagboy is making in their carts and umbrella holders (much more adjustable).
1,Information,nowhere did I see any information that i would have to drill the cart handle. This meant that I had to borrow or buy a drill and bit.Never would have purchased the item if this was upfront. To return it would have cost more in s/h than the item costs
4,BE SURE YOUR UMBRELLA HAS A STRAIGHT HANDLE,"This is a well-made holder, but you want to be sure that the umbrella you wish to use does not have any bend in it, or it will not fit well. Even straight handles with molded grooves for your fingers may not do well, because they are fatter than simple cylindrical handles."
5,Umbrella Holder,We found this very useful because it also provides shade on hot sunny days. Its a lifesaver.
1,Doesn't work with Z-5500 - Why??,"I am connecting the cable with my Logitech Z-5500 speakers but it is showing me ""No digital data"" in the coaxial mode. I would appreciate if someone could guide me and help me set up my audio connections.Amit Jain"
1,Poor/Disappointed,"The seller provided a book in a poor condition than described. More I was ripped of by paying $100 dollars extra for a $15 International edition book. Don't buy from this seller. After receiving the book, I realized that I was sold a book which is not allowed to be sold by the publisher in US."
1,Read and Heed: Doesn't Match Up with Thomas Calculus 11th Edition,If you have Thomas Calculus 11th Edition this book isn't for you.
3,Helpful,"The solutions manual is helpful IF you already know what you are doing for the most part. The explanations are sometimes step-by-step, but many of them are not. This manual does not ""hold your hand"" like some of the others that I've had experience with.I would still recommend purchasing this book because of its low price."
3,NOoooOoooooooOooo,IS THERE AN ANSWER BOOK for the EVEN NUMBERED PROBLEMS? I need help with the EXPLORATIONS problems.- Yi Sun
3,A pretty good reference for a beginner,"The book gives good instructions for a beginner to learn how to handle a black powder weapon. The best chapters are on cleaning and loading the weapon. Overall, I would suggest it for a beginner."
4,A good book for beginners.,"This book contains black and white photos. It covers many aspects of black powder to include history of, bullet casting, ballistics and cleaning. After reading this book I felt confident in my ability to properly load and fire my black powder rifle."
4,"A ""Must Have"" for the black powder hunter","Sam Fadala is the dean of muzzle-loading hunting. He is one of the few writers to approach the subject from the scientific point. Fadala covers it all from shooting, cleaning, repairing, tune ups, ballistics, do-it-yourself, and more. He even covers some of the history and examines some of the folklore of black powder. If you are serious about hunting with a muzzle-loader, get Fadala's books !"
2,Convoluted and difficult to read,I though this book was convoluted and difficult to read. It was also boring and poorly written.
1,Overpriced waste of money,This reads like a PhD thesis. Woefully short on understandable and useable detail but chock full of references and long-winded explanations of their research methodology. General texts on selling to senior management will give you better information at a much more reasonable price.
4,That Sexy Kiley Jacoby !!!!!,"I am a huge fan of Brenda M. Hampton, I have enjoyed reading all of her books Jaylins still my MAN! I have had mixed feelings about this one. I enjoyed it, but it didn't have that RUSH that Brenda is know to give me. The first part of this book How Can I Be Down..I loved that one. In this book I felt Brenda really didn't know what to do with Kiley so she kept him in a bunch of un-necessary drama. And Candi that's what you get. I just can't wait to see what Brenda has in store for us next."
2,somewhat disappointing,"Thus far I've been a fan of Ms. Hampton but she lost me on this one. Once you can't get past the obvious lack of editing the story does hold your attention if you can get past the use of the word Moreso over and over. The character returns to the same ol' thing he was jailed for. In summary, same story, same character same ending."
5,Lifting the Burdens of Debt,"This book was right on time for me this year. I was in the mode of creating a debt-free life from this point on. I knew what I needed to do, but Lifting the Burdens of Debt gave me the know how and spiritual support to make sure that I do it the correct way. To date, I must say that I am no longer held hostage by debt. Thanks Mrs. Rogers-Cherry for your very timely and insightful view of debt. When will we get the follow-up sequel?Debt-Free & Spiritually Sound,Ruth Roman LynchPresident/CEO - R & R Business Solutions & Development, Inc."
2,"Noisy, better get out the ear plugs !","I brought it home from Best Buy and unpacked it. I tested two different VHS tapes and with both it was very noisy to an annoying level. The DVD player seemed to function ok. Nevertheless, this unit is going back to the store tomorrow.On a side note, all you get in the package is composite cables, which defeats the purpose of buying ""a high quality"" DVD player. It sure would have been nice to include component cables at least. Keys have also a cheap feel to them but most of us use the remote anyway."
1,Absolute JUNK!!!,"This product follows an interesting trend of well known respected companies producing absolute junk. You probably will better buying no name products these days.HDMI output died in two days, VCR and tuner have horrible picture quality and are not upconverted so you need to use two inputs on your monitor. DVD player when it was working would not read most of my DVD recordable media. Save your money. Even if you find this refurbished for less than fifty bucks, it is way too much money."
1,Free would be too much to pay for this thing.,"With this one purchase I have lost all confidence in Samsung. Another of the once great OEMs that has apparently fallen to rampant consumerism.Out of the box this thing sounded like a remote control model airplane when I plugged it in, and as I cycled through the menu I quickly found that the VCR just wouldn't play...I tried 3 different tapes but none would advance or play. I see other people complaining about this and I should have checked here before buying but I was on the road and it looked like a good deal with the HDMI and all.From the look of the customer service rep at the store, I suspect a lot of these units come back. I had much better luck with the Phillips combo unit I replaced this dog with, and at 25% less than this soon to be obsolete Samsung unit."
2,Amos Walker: Private Eye and Cliche,"I was given ""Poison Blonde"" by a friend who is a big fan of the author and his work. I have an interest In Robert B Parker's Spenser series and Peter Corris's Cliff Hardy so Amos Walker should be part of a natural progression.Unfortunately, I cannot say that Estleman's creation, Amos Walker, lived up to some of the hype. I found ""Poison Blonde"" to be confusing to the point of losing interest. The narrative itself tries too hard to be of a crime genre. In fact, the narrative lapses to clichés regularly. Quite quickly, the clichés tire.Could I recommend the adventures of Amos Walker? Simply, the answer is ""no"". My friend will be disappointed but each to his own poison."
3,A Chick Flick with Guy Appeal,"The Secret World of women...Well, sorta... this is a film of feminine indulgeance, gossip, and stuff, served with very British flare. A group of women sit around naked talking about their lives, what should or could have been in a steambath. The characters are universally likeable, the type of women one would definately take home. I enjoyed the film, but the story could have had a bit more to it. Recomended for couples."
2,Steaming,This is avery slow and drawn out movie that at times sends you to sleep rather grip your interest. I found it difficult to watch.
4,norteno ketchup,"contains chart-topping norteno arrangement of ""Aserje"" (""The Ketchup Song""). debut album"
4,Memorable characters!,"memorable characters, good to great plots, very interesting juxtaposition of myth and modern technology. Very realistic feeling settings, nice to have settings in Canada (for a change!), even though I'm not Canadian!"
5,Blood Lines,"Wow - can't believe that Vickie is now a Vampire like Henry - that was a surprise as it did not happen in the TV series, so far"
4,"vampires, detectives and mummies oh my","This book starts where the last of the Vicki Nelson books leave off. Henry, the vampire and the bastard son of Henry VIII is having dreams about the sun. He enlists Vicki's help to find the reason behind these nightmares. What they find is a life stealing mummy intent on taking over the city. While this book does not quite measure up to the previous two novels it does a good job a bringing the main characters to the next level of familiarity with the reader. This is an enjoyable series that proves that Ms. Huff is one of the better authors in this genre. A must read for any fan of horror or detective novels."
3,and 4 stars.... a good read,"This is one of those books where you're not really sure if it was good or very good. I found that I really liked the three main characters and am interested in how they started out together and how it all ends. Since finishing Blood Lines I have placed an order for the other four books in the series - so that tells me I considered it good. The real telling point for me was when I finished Blood Lines and couldn't bring myself to put it in the ""used bookstore"" bag. If you are going to read the series, please start with the first book and read them in order. Where that is not really necessary, it does give you some of the history behind the Henry, Vickie and Celluci and they do make some references to past experiences. All in all - I don't think this is a series that should be passed up."

5,Dora's Pirate Adventure,"This movie is really great! Dora and Boots go on a Pirate adventure with all of their friends, including Diego. They sing and teach certain words in Spanish.It's a great movie and I would recommend it to any parent whose children like Dora and/or Diego."
3,Watched once then threw to the curve,Its could be just my little one but this movie did not hold his interest at all and he LOVED Dora at the time I bought it. He put it in and I don't even think he finished watching it before he took it out and put on something else never to return to this movie again.
5,We love it!,My son is 4 and my daughter is 1 and they both love this video. We are seeing the live version of the video and now I know that those tickets were not a waste of money. My 1 year old talks to the TV during the video and my son sings the silly bridge's songs to everyone.
4,Pirate Piggies,"My daughter has said Pirate Piggies enough times for me to remember it. Most Dora DVDs are loved by little kids in the pre-K to K age range. I bought this along with a couple other Dora DVDs because of this reason. It's good for the kids to watch some of these episodes over several times, they remember more words and start building their vocabulary early on."
3,Nice costume but....,"Nice costume. My daughter loved it for her halloween costume and will use it afterward for dress up. However, I was disappointed because in the review it said it comes with gloves, petty coat, and hair tie to match dress and it did not come with it. Just the dress itself. Besides that it was great."
4,"LUTHER CAN SURE NUFF SING, CAN'T HE???","Luther is a great vocalist!! The proof of that is his cover of Dionne Warwick's ""What The World Needs Now"" and ""The Impossible Dream"".If You haven't already, find this CD and buy just for those two tracks. Keep in mind, you'll love his version of ""Reflections"" and others. But, the clear star of this cd (for me, at least) is ""What The World Needs Now""I MISS YOU ALREADY LUTHER!!!!!"
5,Where's the music video?,"I bought this album for one song in particular and that is ""Ain't no stoppin us now"" and I find this to be one of his greatest hits! Even though it's been six years, he is still the greatest musician, singer, and entertainer around. I'm disappointed that he does Not have a music video featuring this song. If anyone has any knowledge on where it can be purchased PLEASE e-mail me. I attended a conference last year, and someone had either purchased or copied his performance with this particular song. Help! I'm desparate for this musical piece."
2,Very Average&Sad,I Know Luther Vandross wanted to Cross-Over but this isn't the way to go.I think Luther Does Lionel Richie Justice.Hello &Endless Love is With Marriah is Alright but feels more like Business than True Feelings.This Is a Very Soulless Luther Album and that does The Man an InJustice.What Happened To The Soul?
2,"The ""concept"" must've looked good on paper....","A standard Luther Vandross album ""device"" is his inclusion of, at least, one ""classic"" tune delivered in the distinctive sound of the singer. So, like the fairy tale of a certain hallowed goose, perhaps recording ""gold"" would be made if instead of one reworking, the singer could devote an entire disc to the songs of others.Unfortunately, the strategy fell through. Perhaps, it lies in the selection of material, but this is one of Vandross's lesser efforts. Too many of the songs have the MOR stamp on them and lack the romantic soul that is characteristically Luther.Yes, Luther, you did lay an egg with this one!"
2,horrifically banal,"Oh come on Luther. For someone with such a voice, such an angelic, thick as honey and smooth as silk voice...why must you resort to this madness? This is BENEATH you, Luther, this endless droning on as you just barely do justice to these ""timeless"" classics...and don't you KNOW Luther? Don't you KNOW that everyone else in the world has done this before you? Is there such a dearth of originality in your production camp that THIS is the only thing you could come up with?Spare us. Go back to the drawing table; try and find A House Is Not A Home somewhere in the endless, blank sheets...ENOUGH. This album is just not good. Not good at all. What's become of you, my friend?"
3,Wish I had found a Brand New CD,"In all fairness to the seller I bought this CD used, rated `Good' condition (not `E' or `VG') so my fingers were crossed and my eyes shut tight. It came eventually (a bit slow on the shipping) and I counted at least nine scratches/skips. Thankfully, `The Impossible Dream' was not scratched.Luther Vandross remains one of my all-time favourite singers, the three stars represent the actual quality of the CD (I was basically warned to expect stratches) the actual songs I would give 3.5-4 stars."
2,out of focus,"I received this camera yesterday, and I am going to return it now.The exterior designe is nice in my opinion, though I would like to have an optical viewfinder as an option.The picture quality is extremely poor.Apparently, the only way to get them in focus is to use manual focus mode.I am quite surprised with this because my Pentax Optio33WR(3.2MP) after 2 years of use is doing just fine even in relatively dark conditions.It is possible that the camera I got was simply defective."
5,definitely a useful tool,"This book is a straightforward guide with a realistic plan to follow. The author gives you up to date ideas about the quick, ever-changing world of sales management. The amount of information given is abundant. I have made several readings of this book so far. This book has showed me how to compete in today's world successfully, while getting ready for what lies ahead. A great book for anyone thinking about sales management or already engulfed."
5,"Finally, Robert Simpkins's Sales Secrets Strategies in Print","Robert Simpkins insights have proven invaluable to my organization. His secrets and strategies showed us how to successfully compete in today's complex business world and better prepare for tomorrow's challenges and trends. Whether in print or in person, I'm sold on Robert Simpkins."
5,Toad in thier Prime...,"Dulcinea rocks my left index finger. Toad's timeless music has been a great inspiration to me and this is one of the best Toad albums. Throw this album on, crank it up, and meditate about your life... good stuff. Favorite song: Windmills"
1,THIS IS A HORRID CD!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Don't buy this CD. Never. It is so bad. I promise you, it is the worst CD ever!! I won it in some raffle (I'd rather die than spend money on it) and I am either going to sell it to some poor sod or smash it into a billion pieces! Don't waste your money"
4,Windmills,"Windmills is my most fav song ever...love the steady beat in the background, with the guitar line over it. simple and beautiful. there's a sad, brooding quality to a lot of their songs - but at the same its kinda uplifting. good stuff - give it a listen.Btw, it's cool to see toad fans raving about their music. I think i'm the only person in NYC who still knows em - seriously."
5,TOAD THE WET SPROCKET RULES THE MUSIC UNIVERSE!!!,"It cannot be denied that this really is Toad's best. Their lyrics are intelligent and the music is, what can I say? DAMN GOOD!"
5,Good purchase,"I have been using this product for 6 months so far and it is really excellent, compared to the many others that I had to return before. I am currently considering buying another one ( got it from Family dollar ) just in case they run out of it in the future. recommended for sure."
2,Mine didn't work,"I recently bought this on clearance while looking for some cheap powered speakers. It never worked in that capacity, but the blue LED power indicator light is surprisingly robust, and could double as a flashlight in an emergency. Oh, and it comes with a 3.5 mm male to male stereo cable, which is something else that I had been meaning to buy."
4,The cookie cat and the bakers,"This book is about a cookie-store and bakers. It was night and the baker looked and saw a kitten. The bakers bought the kitten a bag of cat food, a little gray bed and a white dish that said Kitty on it. The bakers decided to keep the kitten. This book uses really good and amazing pictures by Cynthia Rylant. I think if you are 5 or older you would really like this book."
3,I wasn't thrilled with this book,"My daughter is 5 and starting Kindergarden in the fall. We're making our way through the school's recommended summer reading list and came to this.This has been my least favorite book so far. There's no real story and the illustrations are crude (but colourful). Also, I had to explain marzipan.The target audience in our house liked it OK, though. She asked to hear it twice and made me read the recipes in the back, too. The gingerbread men actually sound pretty good...."
1,This is not a litter bag,Sorry but the product description is misleading. It's a high quality item but more suitable for a rock climber to clip to his/her belt for non-slip chalk dust for the hands. I wanted a LITTER BAG!
3,"Cool looking, Silly little pouch!","For the looks alone it gets 3 stars. For the rest 3 stars as well. For the price I would say I have no regrets. I been using it hanging on the blinker handle on my car. Barely fitted and it is small enough to where you can not see it but it also was kind of hard to fit in that place. The other options like hang it from a head rest with the belt they issued did not appeal to me. I thought it would be better if it was inconspicuous from the world at large. The inside is quite small, enough to throw a few kleenex? wrappers, etc., and empty when no more can fit. Really a 3.5 for what it is supposed to do but for looks probably more. Who knows? I might get to like it more and more and if my life is so uneventful that I feel compelled to update this review then perhaps I will. In the meantime 3 Stars for the Cool looking, Silly little pouch!"
3,Car Pouch,Does its jobRather ungainly looking - if one can apply such a term to a large hold-all pouch.
5,HBO masterpiece,"If you are looking for one of those magnificant hometown stories that reminds you of growing up in a small community of people who knows what everybody else is up to, then this is the story to watch. Everything about this film---from the scenery to the inside of the grill----is perfect."
3,"FRED SCHEPISI, OPUS 16","**1/2 2005. A TV movie based on Richard Russo'sEmpire Fallsand directed by Fred Schepisi. Two Golden Globes and an Emmy award. A stellar cast for this 240 minutes adaptation of Richard Russo's novel. Not great, not bad, the film depicts the life of a few people living in a small New England town. In my opinion, it should have been much longer in order to describe all the tracks the residents of Empire Falls have left in the town. As it is, EMPIRE FALLS is imperfect and can only emphasize the limitations of the TV medium. Already forgotten."
3,Wanting a bit more,"Have not read the novel so cannot compare the movie to it. Nor did I grow up in that area so cannot relate to if that is how a town like that would be.It is an o.k. film but left too many holes in the story and was too much of a story to tell in just those few hours. This would have been better as a several hour mini series.Paul Newman is greatHelen Hunt does a good job but goes overboard in trying to create a ""Maine accent""...it stands out as she is the only one talking that way and that makes it even more annoying.Theresa Russell...man does she look different from 20 years ago. Did not even know it was her.All in all a typical story about lost dreams, inner demons, future hopes, etc.Ending is rushed and since I was slowly being drawn into their world I wanted more of this movie. Do not think it a total waste of time and a not too bad way to kill a few hours.Gets 3 stars but could have been a 5 star if a longer mini series."
3,DVD for mom and dad.,The binding on the DVD case backing was broken but other than that it was in excellent cndition. Also The movie is an excellent movie and was interesting.
3,BAD COMMENTARY TRACK,I like the 8 episode version after a slow start. The commentary was disappointing because the comments did not often follow the visuals. They should have explained why they chose a '62 Thunderbird for Hoffman's character and then shot it like a contemporary commercial which is about escape. This was THE CAR at that time in which to escape and it should have been acknowledged.
2,And you thought you had problems,Talk about a depressing film. Frankly this plays like a competition of which character has the most effed up life. By the time we arrive at the school shooting-you feel like you need to duck from the kitchen sink being tossed into the script. Even the excellent calibre of actors couldn't do more for this mediocre story.
1,Loved it,"My book club read the book, so I watched the DVD already knowing what would happen.Nevertheless I loved the movie. Yes it is long, but it covers the story very well. Paul Newman steals the show. He made his character even better than in the book. Helen Hunt was fab as the ex-wife.Putting the book to pictures really fleshed it out. I love in the end when you see the mill, turned into an L.L. Bean outlet. That's so typical of today's economy -- good jobs gone retail clerk.So yes, it is long, but the story is engaging."
5,An excellent story and production,"I love Richard Russo's stories and this one is outstanding. The production values are also outstanding, and it's fun to see old favorites like Paul Newman, Joanne Woodward, Ed Harris, Aidan Quinn, Helen Hunt and Philip Seymour Hoffman strutting their stuff."
4,Remarkable Cast of Characters,"In this HBO miniseries of Richard Russo's novel, Ed Harris plays an unpretentious restaurant manger that shows us his life within a small economically depressed Maine town. While trying to keep the doors of the Empire Grill open, he must deal with an ever increasing cast of characters - from Joanne Woodward, the town matriarch to Paul Newman - his curmudgeonly wayward father, to his ex-wife Helen Hunt (who does not pull off the accent very well). Ed Harris shows the traumas and realities of his everyday life while coming to terms with his past.I never did read the book which some swear is better, but this gem of a movies, with its beautiful scenery and amazing cast of characters is a wonderful way to spend an afternoon."
2,Boring and slow-paced,"Although a star-studded cast, this movie seems to have no plot and moves ever so slowly. I usually love HBO mini-series and love the late Paul Newman and his wife JoAnne Woodward; but this was a very poor vehicle as one of Newman's last; although Newman was the only superb about this mini series."
5,"In Memoriam, Paul Leonard Newman (1925-2008)","This miniseries should be re-watched because we lost a GREAT actor recently who done so good for so many.This was his final appearance on film and he deserves a final award. Now is not the time to grieve, it is time to help others who need our help. This will truly honor a GREAT man indeed...Markus Henry McLaughlinmarknetproductions.wordpress.comHudson, MA, USA"
4,Love it,"I have just discovered a great music group that i didn't know about. the music is just great, the voices are something else, love this cd want to buy all of the ones they have out."
5,Maverick Gold,What can I say? If you like The Mavericks...you really should buy this one and if you have not ever heard The Mavericks then you should try it out...this is a one-size-fits-all kind of album
3,ok cd,"i only like 4 songs or so, but its okay and i bought it used so i got a really good price for it."
4,Wonderful Renditions of Billy's Classics!,"This is arguably Blanchard's best work. Smooth, soothing ballads and groovy upbeat renditions make this album fly by. I'm not a big fan of trumpet muting, but he employs it here without being shrill or annoying. The vocals are wonderful too. Jeanie Bryson does Billy's emotion justice while adding her own dash of sultry swing and flair. It's a great performance on all parts. Many of the ballads are reminiscent of ""I'm Old Fashioned"" by Coltrane and ""Blue in Green"" by Miles Davis. If that's what you like this has it."
3,If you like jazz,"I give this CD a three star. Maybe, my sound system wasn't stereophonic enough. It was just O K for me."
4,I wish I'd paid attention to the size...,"I really only meant to buy 8x10 paper, not 8.5x14.The paper's fine though, so I don't want to give it a bad review. I just didn't read the title carefully. I was searching for the word ""Recycled"", not looking for much of anything else."
3,"Easy to clean, but white noise is a bit ""noisy""","This is my first humidifier, so I don't have anything to compare it to. However, I have used it for three winters now and it is everything I wanted: it works well and is really easy to clean because you can reach all of the places water passes with ease. The trouble I have this year is finding replacement wicks. My local Walgreen's used to have them, but no more. I am in the process of cruising the internet as I write..."
1,LOUD!!!,I got a good deal on this humidifer at a local store. I brought it home filled it with water set it in my living room and plugged it in. All very simple. I then procede to turn the thing on. WOW! It was so loud even on the lowest setting that I had to turn up my tv to hear it. Ill never know if it actually raises the humidity in the room because after 15 minutes I packed it back up and took it back to the store.
2,Disappointed,"To call this ""ultra-dry"" is the overstatement of the year. This cloth is not nearly as good as real and synthetic chamois cloths I've used. I will say you don't see lint, and maybe that's because the lint is hidden on all the wetness left behind. I've used a professional roller squeegee to dry this cloth but the only effective way I've found is to wait several hours or a day (after wringing it dry)to use it. Buy something else!"
4,A piece of alternative era mastery!,"In my mind, the true era of alternative rock ended in about '95 or '96. Nowadays, everything is lumped into the alternative rock category. But Sponge is definitely one of the brighter spots in the era that was alternative rock. ""Molly"" and ""Plowed"" are 2 of the radio-friendly gems found on this one heck of a good album. Sponge is terribly underrated and often forgotten. Much to my dismay, All Music Guide's reviewer called them a Stone Pilots rip-off. Nothing could be further from the truth. Vin and the gang are original in sound, vocals, and songcraft. This is their best album, and is definitely worth your time."
3,Err....Only one catchy one.,"I don't know why, but this CD seemed to have only one good ""tune"" on it, and that was Plowed. It seemed to be the only one the was great, the rest were either ok or good."
2,Typical college radio fare,"I bought this CD based on a recommendation from a friend and the reviews here. Kind of disappointed to find that it is the same old pop nonsense that 90's record execs spent the decade trying to pass off as `alternative.' A typical lyric? `Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.' If you have any interest in originality; if you listen to PJ Harvey or The Geraldine Fibbers, if you owned `Bleach' before `Nevermind' was even a twinkle in Kurt Cobain's eye, if you still have VU and Nico on vinyl-give this CD a wide berth. If, on the other hand, you've ever written the words `Pearl Jam Rules' on a bathroom wall, don't walk, run to the nearest record store and buy it."
3,Not as good as everyone is saying,"It's got a few decent tracks, plowed and molly. For the most part the rest of them come off feeling half-finished and generic. If you *really* like the early-mid 90's grunge sound this might be for you. If not, I'd suggest looking elsewhere. Actual rating should be 2.5 Stars, but you can't give half stars so yeah..."
5,One that holds up,"It's easy to rip on an album years later by calling it ""dated,"" but everything sounds dated after a while. The true test of a great collection of songs is how appealing it remains over the years. I spent the better part of the '90s purchasing albums from the alternative/grunge genre, many of which I no longer listen to. But when looking for a few CDs to take to work or on a trip, I always seem to include Rotting Pinata, which surprises me given that I never used to think of Sponge as a great '90s band. Now I realize that Rotting Pinata captures what was great about grunge -- grinding, purposeful tempos, walls of noise, smart pop hooks. There isn't a bad song in this bunch, and the hidden track is a real treat. I personally don't care if Sponge or their first album isn't fashionable any more. I listen to Rotting Pinata all the time, and that makes it a classic in my book."
3,Good band....WRONG CATEGORY!,"I owned this album years ago and it's a decent one. But, I don't think this belongs in the Drum & Bass section people!"
2,Dissapointment,"I bought Sponge's CD ""Rotting Pinata"" a couple years ago when I first heard the ripping and emotional 1994 hit ""plowed."" Needless to say, the rest of the CD does not even come close to that one song. While the album is not a complete snoozefest, it is the kind of music that can be easily forgotten and thrown onto your shelf, not to be seen for a couple years. While the extreme energy of ""plowed"" makes you want to run in the streets or start your own band, songs like ""molly"" and ""rotting pinata"" are enjoyable to listen to a few times and quickly start to become a drone. This is a good CD to pick up at a used CD store if you are into the mid 90's sound or you are like me and are captivated by ""plowed."" In conclusion, even though singer Vinnie wants you to ""plow [him] under the ground,"" this album hardly does any such effect."
1,"I just found out yesterday that ""Plow"" wasn't by Mike Ness of Social Distortion","When someone buys a full-length album, and grumbles about how it only has one good song on it, this disc is the kind of album they're talking about.Sponge is a fitting name for this band; they absorb and concentrate all their good music into one song. And I swear to God, I actually thought ""Plowed"" was a Social Distortion song until I saw the music video on VH-1 (literally) yesterday for it. No wonder I couldn't figure out why Mike Ness was singing over a power pop ballad. It was an impersonator.I give this album half a star for one good song. It would've gotten a full five stars had ""Plow"" actually been from Social D on an album surrounded by equally-good Social D songs."
5,One of the best to come out of the 90's.,"It's a funny thing about this album I had it on cassette back when it came out, then I bought the cd a few years later.Oddly enough I never really put the time into listening to all of it. What a mistake that was! When I returned from over seas a few years ago I dug it out of my closet and listened to it all the way through. I have to say this is one of the best rock albums to come out of the 90's. There something I just can't put my finger on but no one else really had a sound like this then or now. My favorite songs are by far pennywheels and miles but the rest of this album does not disappoint."
5,SOAK IT ALL UP WITH SPONGE!,"I wrote a review for this album already, but I forgot to mention that the hidden track, Candy Corn, is actually on it. You have to wait about a minute or so after Rainin' to hear it. Candy Corn and Rainin' are the two best songs on the album, but the entire album is great! Rush out and buy it today!"
4,Good product,"I looked for folio size leather planner and found this product and I am happy about my purchase.The leather is soft and good quality.This comes with starter kit so you don't have to buy address sheet, calendar, etc.. separately. It is ready to use.The price is higher than other planners (since most of them are fake leather) but if you are looking for a planner which you can use for a long time, this is the one."
2,Not soul of a new machine,The book starts off well but I abandoned the book about two thirds of the way in and began skimming to see how it ends. I agree with others that the book loses focus and meanders around.
3,Good for non-programmers,"This is good book for non-programmers that explains on why software is hard to do and how the projects are delayed. However, there is a question of will the non-programmers read throught the 350 pages just to know that. My guess is not.For programmers, the books is old news. Been there, done that. Do you need a book to remind you of the last project that went late?Not all is bad, there are nice chapters for everyone, where the author talks about future of software development. However, those chapters are only a side-track that are made to explain the problems and challanges of software development."
2,As unfocused as Chandler,I thought I would love this book since I like computers and software. But I quit reading about a third of the way through. It goes on and on about nothing at all. It should have been a long magazine article. This is poor story telling.
2,Totally ticked me off,"I have been a software engineer for 30 years. Many times I have pushed the state of the art, at least the commercial state of the art. This book ticked me off because I see some of the pieces I think these supposedly great software folks missed. It bugged the hell out of me because after all that and even a book about it the software, Chandler, really sucks. Is this supposed to be anywhere close to the best we can do?It sounds to me like an awful lot of time was spent on navel gazing, self congratulation, being a prima donna and trying to get over that, and ego-tripping politics. Not so much on really cutting edge insights and design. Not so much choosing the very best languages and tools. The resulting system speaks for itself. If I was grading it instead of the book I am not sure I would give it even one star."
1,Booorringggg...,"Almost impossible to read. The History Of Everything: history of software languages, history of computers, history of programming, objects, and such. Here and there a bit of pseudophilosophical gravy. The essence: screwed up project, because bunch of gurus selected wrong tools as well as didn't know how to plan and execute the project. All the essence would fit into 20-40 pages, and such document woud be interesting. I gave up just around page 200, completely lacking interest what is on remaining 200 pages. Pretty likely will be send back to Amazon"
4,Very provocative ideas about software development,"When I bought this book I thought I would read about tips or techniques about software development in a similar fashion than Code Complete or Pragmatic Programmer. This is not the case and if you are looking for those informations go with the books I've mentioned.But for my surprise I found this book really good in his own way. It really describes via examples and a 'journal'-style events that had happened in the past with me and most likely anyone that has been involved with software development in a professional manner.Some of the ideas and facts exposed can either let you down and make you think twice about creating software or at least, what was in my case, to rethink about the way you have treated the software industry in order to not repeat the same mistakes.I consider a must have book for anyone that wants to create software no matter which technology/language/platform or area (programmer, architect, manager etc)."
5,Software is hard,"This could be a worthy sequel to the much cited ""Mythical Man Month"" by Fred Brooks. A dozen hot shot programmers set out to prove that a needed Personal Information Manager can be programmed ""on time and within budget"" despite the ominous warning that so many previous attempts have failed. If you sympathize with the effort, this will be a fascinating cliff hanger. The book needs a glossary, but I noticed that only after turning the last page and looking back."
5,Awakening to new code,Simply one of the best books about team collaboration. It's amazing seeing each person discuss their approach to productivity software where their own productivity seems to fluster. This books gives a great enlightenment about knowing how to understand the personalities of your team members in order to figure out how to communicate and collaborate with one another.A must read for any person working on a team project.
2,Kinda boring,"I gave up on this book after making my way thru about 3/4 of it. Not bad writing, but not much to hold my interest either. This was not the Soul of New Machine. There just wasn't enough content to keep me reading."
3,Nothing new here,I'm in the software business and found this boring. Couldn't get into it. Read his source material instead (e.g. the Mythical Man Month).
1,I felt it a waste,"Wish I hadn't bought it. I get the feeling many others felt the same since you can buy it for less than a $4 from about a dozen others. I read a couple of chapters and kept asking myself, ""is there a point to this book?"" Anyway I'm finding I can't even resell it for a worthwhile amount, so I'm warning you don't buy it. But if you are totally compelled I have a cheap copy for next to nothing..."
2,out of date,it's for engines in the 90's i needed detroit diesel 2005. quick ship to the prison so i here. thanks
1,Save your money! Look for something else.,"This seat cover reminds me of a little girl trying on her mom's dress. This cover is ill-fitting and cheaply made. With or without the headrest on the seat of my Toyota Tacoma, it still looks baggy and cheap. After the first time that I drove with it on the seat, I noticed that the material had torn in the area where the back piece meets the seat piece. It tore a little above the seam, not at the seam. On top of this, the cheap overwhelming smell of plastic still permeates my truck. There is no way that I would recommend this cover."
4,I'm sure this book is THE definitive field guide for hawaii's corals!,"In a way, this book is discouraging. There are WAY more species of coral in Hawaii than I expected, or I even anticipated seeing while diving.The photographs by author Douglas Fenner are superb, as are the descriptions of the hard, black, and soft corals.This is a book to be used as a field guide, not a book to sit on a bookshelf and collect dust."
4,Product does its Job.,The product does its job but it is not in a spray can as pictured. Its the spray bottle version. The pump didn't work on the cleaner so I put the cleaner in an empty windex bottle. Like I said the products work. Just thought I would let you know.
2,Pricey for what you get.,"I've always liked True Flow filters and have used them on a number of vehicles. I'm not sure if I got a bad batch of cleaner but, it looked watered down and I had to use the entire can to clean one filter. The oil canister was about 3/4 full and looked to be a used product."
1,VERY difficult to do this!,"I admit, I'm quite the butterfingers, not good with my hands! But replacing this tiny (about 1/8"" square) chip was very difficult for me. The included instructions seem to be written by someone in another country! The included adhesive is only one-sided, so I couldn't figure out how to stick the chip in place.Finally got it looking decent, and it fell off when I tried to put it in! At first I thought it fell into the printer! (Wouldn't THAT be nice!) Whew! There it is on the floor! Decided I wasn't going to mess with this anymore!"
3,Price too high for the product you are getting.,"IGO has chosen to limit distribution of this product, so it isn't available from retailers who sell the base charger unit. This forces you to go to them for the tips. Although the number of product models these tips fit is limited, they are popular, especially the Creative and Sony products. Way overpriced for an add-on accessory charger."
2,Not a good fit,"Well, this lid is better than no lid, but . . .I am very disappointed. Anyone reading this review probably knows that Demeyere is an excellent line of pots and pans. I had no idea I could love pots and pans so much!!!! (I have the Atlantis line.) I needed a lid for my large skillet and this is the one that it said to get. I am disappointed, as it is very loose and slides off if I pick up the skillet and do not hold it level. (I know none of these lids fit tightly, but . . none of my other lids slide off and I have a large custom set - even the lid on my smaller skillet stays secure. Big disappoinment after spending a lot of money."
1,Do not buy from this seller,"The lid arrived in a box with broken factory seals, it has been opened before. The surface of the lid is full of scratches - it is visible that somebody tried to polish it. Clearly, this is a floor sample and not a brand new item. I am returning this lid and filing a complaint with Amazon regarding this seller deceit. DO NOT BUY !!!"
4,A fantastic source of religious discussion...,"""Blood Stained Altars"" provides rare insight into the power struggle of two very contrasting dogmas during Mexico's developmental period... it brings into question the power of the organizations and makes one wonder of their influence, whether covert or overt, in today's world..."
5,Amazing book,"If you read this book, you have to go see the movie For Greater Glory. Or, if you have seen the movie and not read the book you are missing a true experience please read the book."
4,Hilarious!,"Honestly, this is one of the funniest stand-ups I've ever seen years! Tony Roberts, Gary Owen and Lil Duval had me CRYING! Tony Roberts had one of his best performances in this one. He's incredibly funny and I look forward to more of these!"
5,awesome comedians,I saw this on cable but had to own this dvd. This item shipped real quick and we were hysterical all night. will do business again
3,Kinda Disappointing,I went to the live show and it was soo funny. I thought I would buy the dvd to share with family and it was not as funny.
2,exorcise this book from your reading list,"Third-rate clone of Blatty's The Exorcist. There are some half-hearted stabs at theological discussion, but they come too late and are lost in the welter of lurid and shocking details. Don't bother."
1,Disappointing and Shallow,"Some of the reviews made this book sound like a gem. However, after reading it I was appalled at the lack of substance and information. The author does not shed any 'innovative' ideas or strategies. The theme of the book is very interesting however, sadly it does not live up to the hype or the basic expectations of a business book. It lacks details, and is filled with fluff. The author could have taken some tips from Michael Dell's Direct from Dell which gives the reader loads of information, insight without painting just the positive points but also, the failures and disappointments that form solid learning material with regards to the building of a global brand."
1,Useless,This book should be given away as a promotional item. It is completely one sided and without much insight information. After reading it you know as much as before. It might be a good read for the Luis Vuiton zombies in Japan. For a business reader it is useless!
2,Should have known better,"...than to trust MS to write a good book. I am an MCSE in NT and this is the last exam before I am MCSA in 2k; however my first experience with an MS book. I have always used Syngress or Exam Cram's and they worked fine. When you get a ""review"" book you expect it to be mostly reading touching up on the sensitive portions of an exam with a few questions at the end of each chapter. NOT this one, its nothing but practice questions. If thats what you are looking for fine. If you want to ""review"" the exam, buy something else and get your practice questions online like the rest of the world. The only reason I am giving it a 2 star, is that the CD included with it is useful and has simulated exams."
2,This should be your last resource.,"This book definitely deals with the more difficult stuff that will be on the exam. However, it's mostly exam questions and only points you to other books to actually get the information you need on each topic (domain). Once you have read other resource materials, this should be used as proof to yourself that you are ready to write the exam. If you need more meat, then go for the full sized version which is 1152 pages, it pretty much has everything this book has, plus all the details you'll need."
4,Great practice!,"If you are gonna sit this exam this is the perfect pre-exam evaluation. Loaded with tons of tough questions and practice tests to help you determine where your weakness lies. Alot cheaper than Transcender too!Also a great review for those more experienced. If you are new to this, read another book first and get some hands-on experience."
5,Excellent beginning....,This is one of the few or only MCSA 70-218 review books on the market and Microsoft should be the leader in producing it. Other print materials may have more practice questions but you can rest assured Microsoft is not going to lead you astray. This book is another in a long line of great Readiness review materials for MCSE/MCSA curriculum.
3,A Cop Out,"A best-of set? In whose opinion? They short-changed us here, folks. Why not do it right and issue ALL of the 30-minute episodes?; that's what the hardcore SCTV fans really wanted. Instead, we got a sampling, an hors devours tray. Bad job, Shout Factory! Please go back and get this right."
5,SCTV Revived,What can I say? This crew is SO creative and clever/funny. Buy it and see what real clever humor is like.
4,Why Some Episodes Weren't Included,"My guess why earlier episodes weren't included is because the creators of the show freely lifted copyrighted materials. This was admitted in the commentaries on the earlier DVDs. In fact, on some of the DVD sets they had to remaster sound tracks or edit out certain skits because they couldn't obtain permission retroactively.Remember, SCTV started as a modest syndicated TV show in a Canadian market. They figured no one would notice or care. Times are different now.Personally, I'd love to see the episode which was a lift of a ""Cisco Kid"" episode redubbed. No doubt they didn't get permission from the copyright holders to do that, so there's no way we'll see that on DVD."
3,"SCTV, the Early Years....","It must be very difficult, putting together a ""Best of"" collection, given the fact that everybody has an iron-clad opinion on what is considered the ""best."" That being said, it was nice to see the ""genesis"" of some of the great characters developed over the years by this stellar group of performers: Count Floyd, Bobby Bittman, Johnny Larue, Edith Prickley...the list goes on and on.If I had any complaints:1. I would have liked one more disk of shows.2. I would have liked a better quality of commentary; quite often, the commentary seemed off the topic, and although I think Robin Duke is a wonderful performer, I would have preferred to have Moranis, or Thomas, or even Levy do some. I add as a caveat: I thought the sections with Andrea Thomas and the news footage of the ""McKenzie Phenomenon"" was a fine addition."
4,Rosato and Levy as Abbott and Costello is Priceless,"This set has my all time favorite SCTV skit, with Rosato and Levy doing a fabulously funny Abbott and Costello in ""The Midnight Express Special"". It's one of the only skits (that and of course Candy's Johnny LaRue, ""I'm not gay!"") I remember from first viewing originally on US TV, it's just so hilariously funny. The whole set here is awesome, from ""The Silly Bastard"" to the ""Cavett-Bittman"" interview, I give all the material here a solid five of five (I blew through all 3 discs in two days it was sooo good); but because its only 15 episodes, and not the complete seasons, I have to give it a 4. It's this kind of video distribution that drives the ""collector's"" market. Get with it, whoever is distributing this show! We want each season put out in total! The early episodes are holding up great for a baby boomer like me that caught this show on late night after Saturday Night Live in the 70's to early 80's!"
1,A Bore,"I was so excited to pick up this book after having it in a pile by my bed for months. It seemed like it would be a delicious summer read. I was wrong. Predictable, uninspired, and boring, I would not suggest this book if you are looking for a summer read. I tend to enjoy Stinson's poetry much more and if you're looking for a summer read, try ""Fat Girl Dances With Rocks""."
5,The best Shamen Album,"This album has the ability to transform your consciousness if you the ability to hear it for what it is. It's not going to open up to you on the level of most of their other work. It's deeply mysterious, mathematicall organic, gaiian, timeless, and far-reaching. I can't listen to this album without being reminded of deep connections between the seen and unseen world, time and space. Life in this moment."
3,"It's not En-tact, but it's not bad.","The Shamen perhaps doomed themselves with the initial success of En-tact and ""Move Any Mountain."" Axis Mutatis has its own flavor, though...where En-tact was uplifting and Boss Drum was quirky, Axis Mutatis is content. ""MK2A"" is an unforgettable track, ""Destination Eschaton"" and other tracks are pretty standard Shamen fare, along with the usual sampling of experimental stuff. If you're a Shamen fan, it's worth getting; if not...En-tact is probably worth a look first."
5,Excellent book,"This book gives me the physics and math details to understand weather that I was looking for, in contrast to the descriptions in other books"
2,Not a complete text- primarilly a workbook,"As the preface says, ""(This book) uses equations to focus on the physics of the atmosphere. Important descriptive concepts of meteorology are intentionally excuded to keep this book concise, and they are well covered in other textbokks such as Meteorology Today by C Donald Ahrens.""It may well be an excellent text; I gave it two stars just to alert people to these facts."
1,Cheap and flimsy,"I didn't expect much more than a day or two of hard play out of this cheapie and that's about what you can expect from it. The stroller is annoying to snap together and it doesn't hold up to an active toddler. I got is on clearace for really cheap, so I got what I wanted from it -- a day's peace. But for a longer lasting doll pram -- look elsewhere."
1,One Hit Wonder,"This is the worst CD I have bought in a long time! The only good song on it is ""New Hit"". The lyrics on some of the other songs make me sick. Leave the country if you hate it that much. If you like Hip Hop DON'T buy this CD, I have no idea what these other people writing reviews heard that I missed."
3,Wow!,"From the duo that brought you ""I'll Be Ready"" comes another round of blissful Euro-cheese. This time around, however, they actually picked a good song to rework. Robin Beck originally performed her song, ""First Time"", across the nation, multiple times a day. How is it possible, you ask? It was featured in the first of a nigh-legendary Coca-Cola campaign - ""Can't beat the real thing"". Thankfully that phrase is missing from this production, but Robin isn't. She rerecorded her vocals with Sunblock, providing us with a lush and fun dance track. One wonders, however, why Euro house whiz Bimbo Jones' mix is absent."
2,save your money,"All of the gear was basically junk. I got this 3 or 4 years ago and most of it had broken down with in a matter of months. Unless you are just a casual photographer with some cheap gear and only use it once or twice a year, don't bother with this equipment. You will have to spend the money and purchase individual products of quality."
3,What's weirder than Weird'?,"Please remove that idiot's post.. Anyways.. Weird Al produces more great music video parodies, but there is one major downside to all his VHS videos, there's not enough music videos on them! Come on, Al, stop worrying about profits, and just spit out one reasonably-priced tape that has a complete collection of all your music videos to date!"
1,Four songs for ten bucks????,"I guess I should have found out more about this video before I bought it, because I was extremely disappointed. Four songs for ten bucks--PLUS--one of the songs was the Beverly Hillbillies song from the movie UHF--which should not have even been put on there. If they did not have enough songs to make a video, then they should have waited until they did. I have always loved Weird Al, but it saddens me that I now feel ripped off."
4,A Great Video,"This video is one of Weird Al's best. Below is a separate review for each song.Amish Paradise: One of my favorite Weird Al videos. Very well-planned and funny.Gump: Good, but not great.Headline News: Pretty good, but it was too painful for me to watch the Bobbit-ectomy part.Money For Nothing/ Beverly Hillbillies: Not funny at all."
2,A DOLLAR A MINUTE,It is a good video but only 13 minutes and it costs 13 Bucks It in other words is a JIP
5,"DUA NA , DUA NA( THEME FROM JAWS REMBER)",READY OR NOT HERE IS MATT IM HERE AGAIN MAN I AM ALMOST FAMOUS AS WEIRD AL HIMSELF (NOTICE HOW I SAID ALMOST) IT IS FUNNIE IT DESERVES ANOTHER 27 MY ARM IS GETTING TIRD FROM WRITING ALL THESE REVIEWSWELL I GOTTAGOTTA GOMATT
3,Belt not too great for heavy loads....,"I tried out this belt carrying one Nikon DLSR with 300mm zoom and one Panasonic zoom camera along with a bottle of water walking around an airshow all day. The web belt kept working loose after a while which would allow the padded belt to shift out of position. The outer web belt is only attached to the padded belt at a few points, which allows the belt to sag quite a bit with the DLSR weight.I used this with the optional Tamrac shoulder harness. Everything feels comfortable when it's all tight and positioned properly, just wish it would stay that way. It would have been good to have velcro attachment for the padded belt as a secondary feature. Plan on trying out a belt from Think Tank photo which looks to be a better design."
4,Great Buy,I purchased this belt from my local camera shop after reading reviews regarding sizing issues. I purchased the small belt and found it to be more than adequate in size. I even had to pull it a little bit tighter than it came from the factory and I still have enough room to rotate it around to the front and pull out what I need. I have 4 lens cases on it and there is no more room for anything else simply because of lack of space to put things...anything else will be directly on my sides under my arms. Will be great for working out in the field so I don't have to keep track of a bag and will save a lot of bending over. For shooting weddings I will have to remove a couple of cases to make it less bulky around my waist.
3,"Ok, for just a few unseen videos","Just arrived, and except for maybe two unseen videos, most of the info has been covered numerous times in other DVD formats, most notably the newest one by Classic Artists. That one had the approval of the Moodies themselves; this one I see is unauthorized (meaning who does get the money?). Loved the partial video of ""Blue Guitar"" and a 1986 rendition of ""Nights in ..."" I would say I only hope the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame sees the last quote from ""Keith Altham"" where he does reiterate, ""why aren't they in the Hall?"""
3,Moody Blues Video,"Disappointing since it is the exact same video as the DVD entitled ""Inside The Music by The Moody Blues"". I purchased both at the same time thinking they were different videos but found out differently. Should be labeled and sold as such."
2,Mistake to buy?,"Probably yes.I agree with all the above reviews. It is the same video as the DVD entitled ""Inside The Music by The Moody Blues"". Should be labeled as such.I bought it mostly because seller advertized this- ""The program also includes a 48-page booklet that offers track-by-track analysis of every Moody Blues recording."" - to give more info on them, since my wife and I are writing a book on the Moodies, hopefully due out in a year or 2. Booklet never arrived.Please leave comments below for questions or input, which we are open to receiving."
1,waste of time?,"You need the tapes, to be able to work with this book. However, it is nearly impossible to find the tapes. I bought this book at the university bookstore and took a university college class, and the professor only had the tapes for the first 8 lessons, which were re-recorded. He couldn't even find the tapes himself. So don't waste your money."
2,Disappointing...and I actually bought this...argh!,"Since when did network constraints actually foster MORE creativity? I'm an enormous fan of the original Greg the Bunny series, and found this new set of pseudo-parodies sophomoric and inconsistent by comparison. Too bad... the thinking behind this new collection seems to have been, ""It just gets funnier every time the F-bomb is dropped by a puppet, right?"" Sorry. There are a few unexpected glimpses of comic brilliance, but honestly this is not what I had hoped for as a follow up to such an amazing, clever, and original show."
4,Finally the IFC version of the show,"This is a nice collection, but it's a shame that it's only a 'best of' and not the entire series. It would be nice to have had the public access shows from the early days on here as a bonus, as well."
3,Return of the Puppets,"Overall, not a bad collection of shorts. Doesn't quite pick up where 'Greg the Bunny' left off, but considering that each segment is designed as a parody, it's understandable.It's good to see the Puppish dream hasn't withered way entirely."
4,Great Product,This is a great little product. I received it and immediately put it into action with my softphone. It worked as advertised without a problem.
3,"Nice self contained, small, usb speakerphone","I bought this to use with my Mac for Skyping and Gizmo'ing. I wanted something small and the optional headset jack was a plus for privacy. Be aware that the headset jack fits your standard Cell phone headset, not a standard PC headset. It works okay, as advertised.Positives: Works with no drivers, small, sound quality is above average, better than the built in microphone on my iBook.Possible negatives: Draws too much power to plug into the usb port on my keyboard, and the cell phone size audio jack requires you purchase a cell phone style headset.What I'm actually using now is a dinky, single ear/mic headset with a plantronic's usb headset adaptor."
4,A big step in the right direction,"Mine arrived today. I tested it on Skype.Sound quality was a bit off, but Skype quality is poor to begin with -- this could have been all Skype issues. Still, it's workable. The device is quite compact, about the size of a very small cell phone or a compact pager. Very light. No mute or volume control -- have to do that using software.The included USB cable is cheap, long and bulky, I use the elegant Zip-LINQ retractable mini-B cable that came with my mouse. The device works with a cell phone earset and has better sound then -- this, in fact, is really what I wanted. They even include a cheap earset, which is a nice touch.It will be far easier to travel with this than with a bulky USB headset. My ideal device would cost the same but:* dump the speaker phone, so make it smaller (use a cell phone earset)* use a built-in short USB cable that nests in the body of the device* add a mute buttonThis isn't my ideal, but it's the best I've seen so far! I think I like it."
2,"Terrible Speaker, Average Microphone","The sound quality of the speaker on this unit is very bad. As for people hearing you clearly on the other end, its performance is average at best. If you are a Mac user looking for a solution for Skype (like me), your built-in speakers and microphone are as good or better than this device."
4,Small and works,"I bought this for use with both Linux and Windows laptops. It works in both, but while my Ubuntu setup sees the device, it's not the default, by default. The sound quality is more than adequate for conferencing, but I wouldn't pipe music over it, at least loudly."
3,Did not met my expectations,I purchased this item because it was supposed to have very good sound quality and a sensitive microphone. It works but it is not something better than the speakers and microphone of my laptop. The only good thing is that now I can put a microphone in the center of the room instead of having it in my laptop.
3,"Ok to use, a little short in performance","Perhaps a bit unfair comparing this product to another 3 times the price (polycom communicator), but the sounds coming from this speaker are muffled, not as clear as even a low price usb speaker.it is an ok product, but it can't be used as a dedicated speaker, and that detracts too much from its functionality."
2,Useless,"Bought this hoping it would be louder than my laptop internal speakers for video conferencing etc.Short story - it's no louder at all.Pros? - well, it does work with no problem under Windows 7."
2,Easy to install and run on Win XP - Lacking 2 key features,"Installation was a breeze. Sound quality is good. There are two important features lacking on this speakerphone. In the product description, I overlooked the fact there is NO mute button on this device. If I had realized this up front, I would not have ordered this speakerphone. The other lacking feature which I was aware of, is that there is NO external volume control. Mute and volume controls are both accessible thru Windows, but I find that method to be quite annoying after a while."
3,USB speakerphone purchase,"The speakerphone works fine on Windows XP machines, but not at all on Vista. The description on the Amazon listing did not clearly state this. Since I have a Vista machine this product is worthless to me. Rather than saying works on PCs and Macs, they should say specifically which operating systems.It does work fine on a friend's XP machine, and the shipping was timely and the product arrived in good condition."
1,Like all the rest,"After reading My Lady's Trust and My Lady's Pleasure as well as almost all of Julia Justiss' books, I find this book redundant. The plot was unoriginal with confusion being the main culprit, the characters were egotistical and stubborn, and of course, the male character was a sex fiend. Overall it just sucked. I found myself skipping chapters of the book as the thoughts of the characters played out for paragraphs and paragraphs. Boring. Just don't do it."
4,They can still put on a hell of a live show,"Since Max Cavelera left Sepultura, their albums have been so-so. This DVD should show all doubters that Derrick Green is a worthy monster to fill the shoes, at least in the live arena. The band's only weak points are when they allow too many guests onstage with them, it gets distracting, and they especially need to drop their horrible cover of Public Enemy's ""Black Steel.."" from the setlist, you can feel the audience isn't into it by their lack of real applause after. Otherwise, this is a bad ass concert film. The documentary bonus disc is pretty weak, but that's not important. Buy this and fall back in love with the mighty SEPULTURA!!"
2,Big project oriented book,"If your company is bringing in a room full of consultants to do a big bang conversion to ITIL this may be the book for you. If your company is more like mine where everyone is trying to move toward ITIL while doing their regular job this will not be much help. There is no index. There are many short lists of things to do and resources and planning guides. They are all general purpose. The book is not organized to match the ITIL areas. You cannot just go to a chapter on service catalogs and get help with creating one. Chapters include Adapting to an ITSM Culture, ITSM Visioning Work Stage, ITSM Assessment Work Stage, ITSM Planning Work Stage, ITSM Process Overviews, ITSM Organization Roles, etc. This book is more about project management instead of specific how-to hints for creating real world ITIL compliant policies and procedures."
1,Stating the Obvious,This book basically takes a standard project implementation methodology and applies it to ITIL in an attempt to claim that the book will enable organization's to implement ITIL processes. The book did not help us get any close to implementing ITIL.
1,"Spelling is important, as is grammar","This might be a decent book were it not for all the typos, spelling mistakes and grammatical errors. As I was quite surprised at the lousy quality of editing, I checked the publisher's web site to find that it is a self-publishing service. That explains a lot. Funny that none of the 'reviews' on the back of the book mention the author's inability to write English."
5,"Corny set-up (with a talking computer), but it's fun anyway!","I got this 50-minute video in the summer of 1988 as a free gift with my Sports Illustrated subscription. The set-up is corny; two janitors at the NFL films studio are shown classic archival highlights by ""Felix the Talking Computer"", but as the reviewer below said, somehow it works.There are some classic NFL moments on this tape that I've never seen on tape elsewhere, such as Jim Marshall's famous wrong-way run with a recovered fumble and Tom Dempsey's 63-yard field goal, plus some funny bloopers, miracle finishes, tributes to oldtime tough guys and clips of the greatest QBs, RBs and receivers of the past. All good stuff.Yes it's dated, but it's still a fun video to watch, and I do so every August to get myself into the mood for another season. Recommended if you can find it for a decent price..."
3,"A good, original album","HDU have broken ground. This New Zealand band hails from Dunedin and their debut album Sum of the Few is worth a listen. Better though, is the second album Cross Channel Multi Tap, which is a far more sophisticated sounds, simply one of the best albums of 1998."
3,Enter the age of Space Rock,"HDU is a little knwn band from Dunedin, New Zealand. Their first album, Sum of the Few is fresh and original. Like most bands that break ground and set standards it has taken time for HDU to be recognized, even in New Zealand. However, with good airplay on student radio (thanks, B-Net) they are becoming better known. Newly released is their second album Cross Channel Multi Tap which is even better than the first. It shows a great progression in their music and deserves to be acknowledged as one of the best albums of 1998. It is really great to see them refine their sound into something more accessible to the general populus, their first truly great album. But it won't be their last. It is more than worth a listen, you will be blwon away by one of the coolest bands in the world today."
5,The most amazing books,"God Allows U-Turns are the most amazing books I have ever read. Currently I have read volumes 1 & 2. These stories are so down to earth, they are truly real. Stories about everyday people overcoming tremendous obstacles. It's about hope and healing. Stories that make your eyes water and your heart smile. Each story is like a sip of sunlight which leaves you thirsty for more. I wasn't able to put them down. I am eagerly awaiting volume 3."
5,Charms Song,"If you like piano music, this is the perfect cd for you. I am in a social and civic club and our club song is in the tune of ""close to you"" thr first song on this cd is ""close to you "" and we can use it when singing our song. That was a great surprise when I played the cd."
2,Sorry Koop,"I am a huge triple6 fan, especially of the founding members. These guys all have tons of tallent and impress me with almost everything they touch However this is the worst album I own by any origional 3-6 member. I tried to like it b/c of how origional tha koopsta is but every time I listen to it I find my self skipping to the next song untill I have made it thru the album in about 10 minutes. If you want a real KK album get the devils playground. Thats a solid junt."
2,Not what I expected,I'm a Tracey lover. I have many of her DVD's. The name of this one struck my interest so I bought it - not what I thought it would be.I thought it would be similar to some of ther other DVD's that offered a fun way to get in shape. This one was too slow for my and I started yawning. I think I'll stick with the Quick Blast Method DVD that has an Abs Blast in it...
2,not much substance,"Good story line, but no feeling came from the characters....like a cake with a great top and pretty icing and all but when you cut into it there is nothing....like all of Norahs other work....very disssipoined...waiting for the next and better book!"
4,Perfect Halloween Costume,"Bought the 2T for my 18 month old and it was a little long in the sleeves and pants, but easily hemmed. Also, the back is completely open due to a slit that goes down to hip-level, and it ties up at the nape of the neck. I sewed on hook & eye closures just to close it up a bit in back. Not the highest quality, but certainly does the trick for a Halloween costume. Stretchy, easey to move in, and VERY cute."
