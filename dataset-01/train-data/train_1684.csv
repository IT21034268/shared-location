4,Great Camera!,"It's my first Panasonic Camera, I have a 2 Sony Cybershot and one Olympus. This is a very good camera, has a lot of features. Takes nice pictures.One bad feature is the small LCD, I would like a bigger one (perhaps a 3""). The zoom is great, and when you use a tripod your photos are better. I'm thinking to buy the external flash because the built-in is not very good. But instead of all I recomend this nice camera."
2,Not the best...,"I made the mistake of ordering this camera to substitute buying a pro camera. The color and noise was terrible. If you want a great point and shoot camera get the Canon powershot s50 while they are still available. The camera has pro features, it was so good they stopped making it because it should have been in the pro camera line at a much higher price tag. If you want to see s50 pictures go to [...] and search my gallery Cathreen Styles. All most all of the pictures in the gallery were taken with the s50. I am going to buy another just to have when mine breaks. By the way, I did end up buy a pro camera, mainly because of the look. I got the Canon 30d and love it!"
3,Great,"is a bombastic camera that i had ever own.lens, LCD monitor and user friendly GUi make me amazed on it."
5,One of my better purchases!,"Great deal on this camera. It offers so much in control, and yet will still take a snapshot. It arrived on time, in good order, just as advertised. I was hesitant as it was a third party vendor (Adorama), but it was an excellent deal and completely as advertised."
4,Very good camera and Leica lens for the price.,"The camera takes great pictures with many useful features. Still in the early learning stage after taking 1150 pictures on our recent trip. One concern is the battery door which is located on the bottom of the camera. It popped open no less than 5 times during use. I,m concerned about knocking it off. Fortunately, the battery is kept in place with an internal lock in the camera.The case does not fit the camera properly. It is too small to safely hold the camera with the strap on. Also, no strap on case, only a belt loop."
5,DMC-FZ50 kicks a##!,"At 10 megapixels, these pics blow up to 11x17 without problems or loss of resolution. And with the added capability of the Camera Raw format (gotta have the latest Adobe update to use in Photoshop), there is no effective limit to the retouching that can be applied before the pic even gets to PShop. Clear, sharp and artifact free even at the full 12x zoom (tripod needed for lower light conditions). The built-in flash works beautifully and the hot-shoe allows for more professional indirect flash lighting; same as any more traditional SLR. While the lens is not interchangeable, it does have superb range of focus and zoom.Whether pro or amateur, this is the camera to consider for those who take their photos seriously, but cannot afford the full multi-thousands of dollars this-is-what-I-do-for-a-living photography studio. Don't be surprised to see this camera used by the pros to back up their studio cams and on-the-road systems."
4,Panasonic DMC-FZ50,"Spent over six months researching digital cameras before making this purchase. Since I will be using on an African safari, the camera had to be capable of handling photos from extreme close-ups to long distances very quickly and with little effort. With zoom capability of 12x and numerous automatic program settings this camera fit the bill perfectly. The only negatives I found are viewing via the viewfinder is poor and it comes with a memory card that is nearly worthless. However, compared to other competing models in the extreme zoom category, the DMC-FZ50 takes the cake."
5,Went from Canon XTi to FZ50 and never looked back!,"I was a owner of Canon products for years, for the past 1.5yrs I have been using a Canon 400D DSLR, I got so tired of lugging around lens and gear that I quit photography all together for a few month's That is until I found the FZ50!The FZ50 is a remarkable camera for its price, In order to have a DSLR witht he range and quality of the lecia lens you would be spending around $5,000 on lens alone, There is no other comparision for this camera,It takes excellent Macro, the color range is dynamic, and it has the best EVF I have seen on a camera, The Mega OIS is a better system than Canons Image stabilzationIt came down to the FZ50 and the Canon S5IS, I am so glad I read revviews and picked this CameraFor anyone sitting on the fence about Panasonic Buy this camera now, you will never regret it"
5,nothing quite like it,"I'm a former 35mm photographer who's a little older and not as spry as I once was and I eventually got out of the habit of lugging a case of equipment everywhere I went. I got re-energized in photography with digital but a small compact point and shoot left me wanting more. Digital SLR's are pricey and as a friend pointed out I'd be back to lugging a case of equipment around me with her. She recommended this model and the more I looked at it the more I liked it.It is a fixed lens model, but with a 12:1 optical zoom what other lenses would really need. It start up fast, zooms and focuses internally so there is no moving barrel to have to hold on to. It has just about every feature an advanced amateur could want. It does macro. And it has an optical stablization system that works as advertised.So far I haven't come across anything that it can't do. This is a nice unit for an advanced amateur or even semi-pro who doesn't want to go full digital SLR yet."
5,Panasonic FZ50S camera makes taking pictures fun!,"This is my third digital camera and the best to date. This camera has the latest technology to diminish or reduce altogether camera shake and produces clear pictures. I particularly like the function button which allows you to instantly change various settings such as the Autofocus and metering mode, ISO sensititivy and picture size. Tests done with the zoom magnification were impressive as well with good clarity even at 21.4x. The features of this camera will be thoroughly utilized in an upcoming trip involving wildlife shots and was purchased just for this adventure.It took awhile to get comfortable with the setup of the camera's manual but perserverance is eventually rewarded."
5,Best Bridge Camera In The Market,"I have it for 1 year now, and it is a awesome camera. If you forget the lens is attached to it, then it is as good as a DSLR. And the lens is may be better than the most of bridge cameras in the market!. A very good semi-professional camera, you will definitely get the feel of a DSLR. I really like the fact that the zoom is manual and there is manual focus too, which you will not get in most of the bridge cameras out there. Its big, but if you want a lens system like this, camera will be big! It is very easy to handle and has a very user friendly system. I like its system more than the canon ones. The battery life is decent!As a whole, it is a very nice camera."
4,Great but not as great as a DSLR,"This is a wonderful camera if you want a light weight, walk around camera that has a huge zoom range. However, for the same price of this camera you can also get a low end DSLR that will have better picture quality and the ability to switch lenses. There is a great deal of noise, especially at the higher ISOs with this Panasonic. With DSLR, depending on which you purchase, there is definitely less noise. Also this camera will take filters, which is huge because it allows you to be even more creative just like with DSLRs. It really comes down to if you want a point and click, or a camera that will allow you to continuesly grow with it in photography."
5,I just love my DMC FZ50,"This is just a great product. The best ""bridge"" camera on the market. It might be a little noisy at high ISO levels, just like any compact camera. Great cuality price ratio, just everything that you could expect from a compact. Besides, It allows you to be creative and to take decisions about your picture (Manual exposure)."
2,"Bought mine for about $600 3 years ago! Nikon w/zoom cheaper, better","DMC-FZ50 10.1 MP, optical stabilizer right? I don't understand how this camera can be $900 when I bought mine about 3 years ago for about $600-$700 with accessories. Pictures are okay but noisy. My husbands $1000 Nikon with nice lens takes better pics for just a little more. I got my stolen and was coming back to see if I could pic one up cheaper because it is an old model. Not worth this price. Check out Nikons with zoom lenses instead, that's where I am going.Watch out on Amazon, I have caught them charging more that listed price, wrote review and price changed! Caveat Emptor!"
3,Not perfect.,The photos are not perfectly clear. They are good but not perfect as the photos I took with my Fugifilm FinePix S7000. It has way to many menues and sub menues. It will take daily use to remember all the different settings. The operating instructions are very complicated and confusing. If you are out and have a problem with a setting and you don't have the instruction book put the camera away. I like the LCD monitor because it folds closed to protect it.
3,A novice trying to learn.....,"I got the camera for Christmas thinking it would be all that I needed to shoot action shots at my son's basketball games. So far they are mostly blurry and nothing Sports Illus. would be interested in. I don't know what I am doing wrong and have read the manual backwards and forwards a half a dozen times. I need help! Anyone with tips on how to shoot indoor, action shots please email me Darren967@aol.comThank you!"
2,Too noisy,"Great camera - awesome handling.Too bad noise, even in bright daylight at ASA100 is excessive.This is not even CLOSE to a DSLR subsitute."
2,Who should buy this?,The camera itself has good features but I'm wondering who would buy this camera at its' price point. A real serious phtographer would opt for a true SLR camera for a few hundred more. A casual amateur don't need to spend this kind of money. A Sony 7.2 Megapixel with 12x optical zoom (or other similar brands) for $360 would save substantial money and meet the needs of substantially all amateurs looking for a better high zoom camera. I don't see real value in this camera.
4,"Great item, poor packaging.","Love this product. I've been using it for quite a few years now. Stopped using it about a year ago because each one of the ones I've purchased in the past, ended up with a broken case (the hinge area).Just bought a new one 2 weeks ago. Same thing happened. Makes me sad such a great product is packaged in such a low quality case."
4,His Ultimate Temptation,"I have enjoyed all three books in the Lone Wolf series. When I read the last book, I was left hanging on the the last ""Lone Wolf"" being Sabastian and his would be mate Carly. Please let me know if I have just missed this book or if the series will be continued."
1,Worst Math Book I've Encountarded,"This book is not user friendly and does not provide many solid examples. Some of the problems that they give in the section work are not solveable from the examples provided.Out of all the math books I've had in my life, this has been the worst one I've had. Unless you have a top notch math instructor to explain this book, I wouldn't recommend it to anyone."
5,transformative art,"Dohnanyi's musical genius is now coming to be recognized, 50 years after his death.The Quintet Op 26 is my all-time favorite piece of chamber music, period. It is mystical philosophy translated into sound. The opening theme, in sotto voce strains two octaves apart, bares our awe before the unknown. The middle movement is an appreciation of love, absurdity and humor. The third and last movement opens with a full fugue in the strings, followed by a chorale in the unaccompanied piano. Magically, the fugue theme comes returns overlaid with the opening theme from the first movement, and the 2nd theme from the first movement chimes in as well in a climax of compositional virtuosity. When the dust clears, and that opening theme returns in a major key, it's just as though we've died and gone to heaven.Transformative piece. A performance that brings out the music's every subtlety.The sextet is jazzy, entertaining, full of laughs and surprises."
4,Overkill=biker thrash,"The only way that I can describe Overkill's style is biker thrash. Go to one of their shows if you don't believe me. You will see a lot of bikers there. This album is the logical follow-up to 1991's ""Horrorscope"", just more punky and bikerish. 1993's ""I Hear Black"" is almost a complete departure from the style of ""Horrorscope"" and makes no logical sense anywhere in Overkill's discography. I like this album quite a bit. I have heard that people don't like this or any other 90's Overkill album very much besides ""Horrorscope"". I do agree that ""Horrorscope"" is the best Overkill album from the 90's but I still like ""I Hear Black"", ""W.F.O."" and ""The Killing Kind"" quite a bit. If you're into quality non-generic thrash metal from the 90's definately get this album. You won't be disappointed."
5,Yet Again...,"Hes Done it again... one of the best albums ive ever listened to, and my new favortie Donnie Mcclurkin album... on this project he simply takes us to church... its purely worship.. i nearly lost my mind listening to it in the car... A great album.. a must listen.. and a welcome addition to your collections."
5,Only brought back memories of a wonderful night of praise,"If this sounded like a taped church service, it's because it actually was! I was there that night. I'm glad it was a live recording, because it made for a night filled with praise and true worship.Listening to the CD and then eventually watching the DVD after being there just took be back to that awesome night. Pastor McClurkin is so anointed. He seems to sing effortlessly and from a heart that believes every word of the songs.This is a CD that I can share with everyone. My friends would love it, my mom would appreciate the hymns she used to sing with me, new believers in Christ will receive a powerful message about true praise, and older Christians will just be encouraged to worship all over again."
5,'True' Gospel,"Now this is what I'm talking about! Pastor Donnie's renditions of these songs took me right back to marching down the aisle to ""We've come this far by faith"", just like we used to do. I actually got up and marched through my house. Praise God! Boy, did I ever need this timely record of worship & praise. In today's music we get lost to what true gospel was all about, not to say that today's music isn't with it, but boy, did this album take me back, right to the place where I first believed. Pastor Donnie is truly listening to the heart of God, because he ministers to us just where we're at and then takes us up a level to a new view of worship, the soul of it and the heart of it. A great project for Pastor Donnie!"
4,Good Project !!!,"Not as good as ""Live in London"" but still a very good project. CD and DVD are a part of my collection. Lots of Spirit-filled songs for the soul."
5,"Psalms, Hymns and Spiritual Songs",The selection of songs is a wonderful blend of high energy and meditation that provide a total worship experience. I highly recommend it for anyone who truly loves versatility.
5,ONE OFALL TIME FAV,I love this CD. CD one is so beautiful. When I cant decide on what i want to listen too I can always pop this cd in and be content.
4,Anointed,This cd is more about the power of the anointing in the songs that he's singing than the songs themselves. The arrangements and production is simple but powerful in its simplicity.If youre looking for upbeat get my praise on songs you wont really find them here as the cd is quite 'traditional gospel' musically.But if its anointed I'm all up for it.
5,Donnie McClurkin Psalms & Hymns,"This CD took me all the back to my childhood and reminded me of many people I hold dear in my heart. I enjoyed it tremendously. Donnie's voice cannot be matched to any other singer's voice. His voice is so anointed until tears just automatically flowed from my eyes and chills moved up and down my body as I listened to all of that anointing caught up in those hymns, Psalms, and Spiritual songs. This CD brought to my memory many hymns that I had almost forgotten because many of these hymns are not sung in many of our churches today. This CD is a ""Must-Have"" for all of God's people. It is a keepsake for me and I hold it as more valuable than gold."
5,Awsome Praise,"I really love this CD. I love it so much that I went out and bought the DVD. This is my meditation CD. I listen to it on my way to work, around the house and anything I need a lift. Thanks Pastor McClurkin for allowing the Lord to use you as a gift and blessing to others."
2,Not enough sex in the game,"When I first bought this product I was excited. I have purchased sex games before and that one was from touch of romance. It was so fun! but I lost it and had to buy a new one. I bought this one mainly because of the price and felt like if it suck I wouldn't lose alot. I was right. It does suck. But to be fair no one really writes well about the sex games and the company's don't give too much info away. I didn't like this game because it has too much to do and not enough intimacy. I prefer games that say to choose an area, choose how to show intimacy, and whether there should be external toys and such should be an option, all while playing a fun board game."
4,Boy. Friend.,"This book starts by saying how Kristin and Brian were at a party and Kristin spilled punch all over herself.Then Brian's bro Billy and his bud Mike Kalb come to pick up Kristin and Brian.Kristin looks like a wreck, and after they drop her off, the boys go to a movie. At the movie all of them are making fun of how Kristin looked.Then Billy starts saying how if Mike wants to get into a club, he has to take a girl to dinner at the club head's house and serve them dog food, indicating that they are comparing their date to a dog. Mike then says he will ask Kristin to it. Brian doesnt believe it, but the next day Kristin is so happy because Mike asked her out. Brian tries to tell her,but she wont listen to him.Find out what happens next by ordering your copy of Boy. Friend. today"
5,Brian has to save kristin from the most horrible date,"When mike asks kristyn to his wrestling team innitiation that will make her look bad-make her look like a dog-Brian, kristin's good friend has to save her but he cant tell her without hurting her feelings"
3,it was ok,I like reading sv jr.high but this had nothing to do with the twins only about kristin and brian. i wish they didnt write about them but... kristin gets asked on a date by a highschooler(one of brians brothers friends) shes all excited but brian knows its all a big joke. still he doesnt say anything. kristin goes on the date and the rest....... is a SURPRISE!
1,Doesn't fit. Save your $,"These covers are the exact same size as orig. cover. Two grown men almost having a stroke trying to get cover on. I eventually had to cut old cover off, still did not fit. Then I took off the burlap protective covering, still no fit. finally I ended up with 3/4's of the cover on and left it. I really felt like throwing the cover and the target in the garbage after this experience. This cover is suppose to go over orig. it should have been at least a little larger. Forget it that is my advice."
2,"""It's All Bad""","A group of people who are mentally unstable are placed deep under water by an energy company for a special project. They are physically enhanced so they can adapt better to the unusual conditions, but all this seems to do is accentuate their mental illness. Real uplifting stuff. Don't read this if you'd like to have a little ray of sunshine in whatever book you're reading now and then."
3,Potential not realized...,"A potentially excellent novel which fizzles out at the end.Peter Watts combines believable characters, a great story, and an uncommon setting: the bottom of the sea. The science is well-researched and fascinating.However, this wonderful page-turner becomes a complete dud at the end. In fact, I had to immediately visit Amazon to see if there was a sequel ready to buy."
5,A Brave New World,"Peter Watts Will Blow us away for years to come. I am looking forward to his next book. I picked up this book from Amazon.com last month. When it arrived I started to read it that night, and I was unable to put it down. I was up all night, and did not put it down till I finished it. He made the characters come alive, almost like I knew them."
4,A dysfunctional voyage to the bottom of the sea...,"Very solid Science Fiction novel which is somber in tone and a very compelling read. I read this novel not long after Allen Steele's undersea novel ""OceanSpace"" and found a few bits and pieces of parallel storylines -- but the character of the novel is totally different. ""Starfish"" is more cerebral while ""OceanSpace"" is more action oriented. And the plethora of dysfunctional characters, both above and below the sea, create a feeling of dystopia while laying a basis for the story's conclusion.As a first novel for Peter Watts, this is an exceptional accomplishment. Highly recommended."
3,A bit abrupt on the ending...,"I'm in agreement with others' comments, but I thought the ending was rather truncated. We spend much of the book with Lenie as she comes to terms with her surroundings (and a number of other fascinating characters), and just as she figures out what she's about, the book ends.Can you say sequel?"
1,Bleak with too many story tails,"I kept waiting for this book to turn around. It never does. Watts introduces many interesting ideas that on their own would've been interesting (deepwater breathing, gel brains, etc) but fails to focus and develop the plot effectively. It would've been better to focus and develop one idea to it's fullest rather than bouncing around and trying to force all of these neat ideas into one book.Beyond that, it's a bleak book without hope."
4,What Story,"A romp and a little luck at a local bookstore got me Starfish. Boy this novel is dark, touching, and personal. It reminds me of both Arthur Clark and Frank Herbert. If you have ever SCUBA dived and stared at the depth of the sea below alone, you would recognize the novel as if you have dreamt it. It describes that strange feeling, sooth, loneliness, and dread to you the way you always try to describe it to yourself. You also realize you might be more deranged or freaky then you think you are. While you read it, play Sarah Mclachlan's Possession, as sugguested my Watts. I tried it; boy, there was something. I suggest that you play something from Portishead as you read this novel. Mr. Watts has special things to offer for a long time to come. I'm very glad I found Starfish. I can't wait to see what Mr. Watts has in store for his next novel."
1,Jack o Lantern Leaf Bag Crap!!,Bag is too thin and rips very easy.It is not worth the money. I want my money back! Total waste of time
2,Product Feature not accurate !,"Product arrived ahead of schedule and in good condition. I purchased this tailgate net because the ""product feature"" clearly states ""quick release clips for easy access to the truck bed"", beware they are NOT included and appear to be sold as a separate accessory. I would have rated higher but the misinformation was disappointing."
4,Gift for my sister.,"Bought this as a gift for my sister, who loves Luke Goss. I have not seen it, but my sister says it was dark, but pretty good."
5,Spectacular!!!,This movie is an excellent movie and a must see. Keeps your attention the entire time. Lance has commented favorably in his book about this movie and the character had some personal meaning to him. A must see...
3,"Bone Dry, I don't get the title","I liked the concept but the story line needed beefing up, for instance once you find out that Eddie was (or still is) a hit man and had Killed Jimmy's family cause they may have seen something then you are left twisting after that and this would have been the perfect opportunity to expand on the storyline in a way that made perfect sense of what was happening to Eddie I thought the choice of actors was spot on. I love Lance HendricksonHe is truly one of the greatest character actors out there and Luke Goss is really good in this movie despite how little there is for the actors to work with story and plot wise, but still worth seeing -"
2,Dull,This is a dull entry in the Arthur mythos depicting mordred from the account of 3 women who loved him.
5,wonderful music for the soul,"This Cd has so many wonderful, pleasing melodies and earth sounds that blend the Great Spirit with the Creation! My Salish brother starts it with a wonderful Bitterroot Salish language prayer, and the music that follows is comparable to the spirit of the People of the Bitterroot and all brothers elswhere. I've been told by many that this music is good for the soul, and for health... to take time to listen, and relax, because when you listen to this CD, it's ok to relax."
5,"Frank, smart, funny fiction and nonfiction","Though individual pieces may seem forbidding, this collection coheres - with story after story giving you the momentum to read on. By the end, you reach short pieces that actually teach you how to live - something stories and memoirs rarely achieve, even for those of us who consider ourselves serious and openhearted readers. Here is an anthology for the long haul."
4,great but too pricey,"I would have to say that this book is the one to own if you are interested in Peruvian cuisine. It covers all of the ingredients and gives in depth classic recipes as well as a brief history of the culture and cuisine itself. I have looked over several books on Peruvian food, and none compare to this. The only reason this is 4 stars and not 5 is because the price is a bit too high for me."
3,Recipe for Aji de Gallina will kill lesser stomachs,"This is a beautiful and authentic book, however the recipe for aji de gallina either is written for someone with an iron stomach or has a huge typo. It calls for 1 and 1/2 CUPS of aji amarillo paste, not the normal 2-4 tbsps to taste as every other recipe I have ever found. We trusted the book and made it as written and unless you can handle large amounts of extreme heat in one bite, you will be sick afterwards. This has got to be a typo. Warning to any Peruvian food newbies: 1 and 1/2 cups is painful.Great book otherwise, though!"
2,Pretty but...,"You are better off going to about.com and pulling a recipe. I'm Peruvian, so I have a basis for comparison. Save your money!"
1,$75 to $500,"Why $75 to $500 for this book? No, thanks! This book should cost like $19.99 to $29.99. That is fair."
4,Good book but,"I will save the raving - the recipes are great. I am sure you will enjoy them.The book is expensive but you probably won't find it cheaper elsewhere - I looked.It's heavy - over 5 pounds. The whole thing is on heavy glossy paper.It's large. nearly 1 1/2"" thick and 12"" by 9 1/2""It has about one recipe every two pages - the other pages are gorgeous photos.There is no index.The table of contents is bilingual - but alphabetical - in Spanish.I would have quite frankly preferred a paperback or much smaller hardbound."
4,excellent,this study guide is very interesting!! it has many jokes and useful examples to teach students the right way to get better grades! I would recommend it to any student who wants to get better grades.
1,Flow to fast and yes mine too leaked everywhere,I registered for these bottles so when i recieved them as a gift at my shower i was so excited. My son came home from the hospital at almost four weeks old and immediatly i noticed he choked on the formula because it just seemed to pour out of the stage one nipple when held upside down. Not to mention they leaked all over him. I would not recommend these bottles to anyone.
4,Most consistent of Arto's CDs,"For some reason, 'Mundo Civilizado' seems to be regarded as Lindsay's masterpiece, but I like this one a whole lot better, just because 'Mundo' has a lot of okay songs, while this one has a lot of really nice ones. I love the sly horns on 'Ondia,' and slithery percussion on 'Poco Fidar,' and the nice groove set up in 'Modos' that runs through the next four songs, including the memorable skank of 'Rememberences'. ""Ex-Preguica"" intriguingly combines a buzzy groove with one of the most beautiful melodies I've ever heard -- it doesn't seem like a good match, but live and learn. There's nothing that quite stands out from the crowd in this collection, which is just as well -- put it on, lean back, and float away..."
2,Very disappointing,"This was meant to be a replacement for a combo two-line phone/answering machine. The corded phone is practically unusuable due to poor sound quality and resonance, while the answering machine provides eight mailboxes but, in a baffling move, does not allow you to have different messages for each of the two lines. The display does not show what line calls are coming in on, and, oddly, also does not show the caller ID information when the phone rings, though you can get it later! The fax tends to get confused and when someone pauses in their message sends out fax recognition signals. Add to that the expensive ribbons with low capacity and you have a package that's unsuitable for many users. It's fine as a fax but don't fool yourself, the built in phone isn't meant to be used as such."
2,Wouldn't suggest it to my friends...,this is ok...we got it for our 4 year old daughter who loves imaginative play of all sorts. It isn't the sturdiest cardboard i've seen. it's a little awkward for her to manage. i don't remember what i paid for it - but i wouldn't give it a thumbs up.
1,Bad,"I have enjoyed other recordings by the Tatrai, but this one is simply terrible. The intonation problems which crept into their other Haydn cycle CDs is magnified and makes the whole set unlistenable. The Festetiques version is far preferable."
3,Mb 70 is different from MB 75!!,"The product advertised here and showing in the picture is the MB 70. It is not a stand alone item. It needs to be controlled by another Nakamichi product, but Nakamichi people did not know which product is compatible with it.The MB 75, on the other hand, is a stand alone product that does not need any other to control it. It is a radio and 6-CD changer all-in-one.I ordered this item and reveived the MB 70. It took me some time before realizing the problem. I ended up returning it."
2,"Great Pad on the strap, but it is too short","The strap I received does not match the picture at all. It has a great soft grippy pad, that I like, but it is way too short. Overall it is only 31in. (Compared to 51in on a standard Nikon strap) After you fasten it properly to your camera, it leaves you with maybe 25in. Which is barely enough to put your head through. If you are wearing a jacket, you can forget about wearing it over your shoulder, unless you want it to rub on your underarms. That sucks, because I like that pad a lot.I just stopped using that strap and went to a different brand until I can come up with some way to extend it."
3,As advertised,"This strap is as advertised, but not very comfortable. The neoprene part is short and doesn't really go to the collar bone. I'm not a big person, but this is too small. I'll keep it to give to a child and buy another, larger (e.g. more expensive)one."
5,binocular strap,"this is a great strap, however it didn't fit my old binocular strap holes well. It was too wide, but I made it fit."
3,Strap for camera or binoculars,Bought this as a gift. for binoculars. Person said it worked fine. Easy to attach to her binoculars and is comfortable on her neck
3,Wears off easily,The strap has quite good padding. Better than the wide straps and reduces strain when carying my DLSR. But I noticed that it easily wears off.
2,Uncomfortable on your collar bone!,"This strap might have been a lot more comfortable if they re-styled it a bit. The place where the neoprene joins with the strap is very bulky and hit me right on the collar bone. So my neck was happy, but it chafed so much on my collar bone that I had to take it off in minutes. I think the neoprene should have been longer and the side straps shorter. Also, the neoprene is very thick and bulky--much thicker than it appears on the photo. Don't buy this unless you have a lot of room in your camera case to put it."
4,Works fine except in hot weather,This neck strap works just fine and is inexpensive. The only problem is that neoprene is not very comfortable on your skin in the hot weather.
4,Excellent Strap For The Price,"I lost my D300 strap and ordered this as a quick replacement. It is comfortable with good quality construction. I cut off the ends and sewed on a strap with op tech quick release ""snaps"" which I also have attached to the camera. Thus, I can place camera on tripod and release from it. It works well for me and the strap doesn't yell ""expensive camera"". Delivery was quick with no problems."
4,Very good basic camer/binocular strap.,I bought two of these straps. One for our D-SLR camera and one for our full size 10X50 binoculars. The strap works very well for both of these applications. The only complaint is that it could be a bit wider. There was an error made in the shipping cost. Shipping cost were applied to each strap even though they shipped in the same package. We called this error to Op/Tech's attention and it was resolved immediately. I would buy this item again.
2,Decent but not worth the buy,The quality is FAR BETTER than typical free gifts bundled in any gadgets. But it is still over priced. I would go for it if it's 7-8 bucks.
1,Too fat,Ends need to be thinner to work with small point and shoot. Had to return this item to Amazon and get a different strap.
5,NanMcF070317,Very enjoyable entertainment with a strong message. It is refreshing to be entertained by a movie which contains no foul language or sex. I would not even call the action violent though the children are pretty violent with their actions. If they were mine I'm not sure what would happen to them but it would most likely get me into trouble as well.This movie makes one realize that they could be blessed with children like those in the book and movie.
1,Great Expectations. Bad Outcome,"I bought this movie expecting greatness from a collaboration from Colin Firth, Emma Thompson,& Angela Landsbury.I was terribly disappointed with the outcome. The message to children is really bad and fantatious.I will not let any children in my household watch it and do not recommend it."
4,Nanny McPhee,"The DVD arrived on time, was brand new & still in its original packaging. This is a cute movie but more for kids than adults."
5,love this movie!,We've been wanting to get this movie for quite some time now. This was a good price and it's new and still in its package.
4,NANNY MCPHEE,"Good movie for all. Good acting by young and old actors. Adults will like premise and dislike the noise level. Kids will enjoy the hijinks by kids and hopefully not copy at home. Overall, fun movie with no lack of action."
5,Wonderful children's movie,This movie was enjoyed by the entire family. We will watch it again and again. We also own Nanny McPhee Returns. It is a good movie too. The first is the best though.
5,Nanny Pops on Blu-Ray,"The ""Blu-Ray"" edition of Nanny McPhee is a wonderland of color. The look of this film is as important as the delightful story being told, and this format does not disappoint. Spectacular color and depth of field.This is a lovely, off-beat, quirky film and one that bears repeated viewing. Seems I find something new each time I watch it.Emma Thompson is terrific both as the screenwriter and as the title Nanny. She must have her own magical powers, because she manages to get A-list actors in both this film and for its lesser sequel.Many forget Colin Firth is a superb physical comedy actor, in addition to being a sort of penultimate romantic lead. He is wonderful as Mr. Brown in the film.Great support is offered by Angela Lansbury, Celie Imrie, Imelda Staunton, the lovely Kelly McDonald, Derek Jacobi among others, including the appealing children.If one is planning a purchase of ""Nanny McPhee"", Blu-Ray is the way to go if one has the home capabilities to support it."
4,An instant classic,"Emma Thompson shines in her wonderful adaptation. Colin Firth, of course, plays the same British befundled love-sick hero he is in every film and Angela Lansbury should NEVER retire. I loved everything about this film from story, costumes, and casting. If you're looking for a fun enjoyable film you can take the whole family to--look no further. Nanny McPhee has just the magic stick for you!"
5,Love it!,"I will watch this over and over! Enjoyable, fun, quirky, well acted, andNO violence! Characters are believable too, well cast."
4,Bought as a gift,"I bought this item as a gift for my Aunt. The quality was fine, the packaging was perfect for gift giving."
3,Not Mary Poppins,"While a good children's movie, it pales when compared to the classic Mary Poppins. Don't expect song and dance and great adventures. Ms. McPhee just stands around most of the time lookingugly. The story line could have been better done. The silliness and crudeness were really overdone for a children's movie. Go watch the real thing- Mary Poppins, and for a double feature, addBedknobs and Broomsticks."
3,Nanny McPhee,"The Brown children are always misbehaving. They scare away every nanny that their dad, Cedric (Firth), hires. He loves the kids, but does not know what to do. One day, Nanny McPhee (Thompson) shows up at the door, confident that she can restore order to the Brown house. Another problem for Cedric is Great Aunt Adelaide (Lansbury). She supports Cedric's family, and has decided to cut off funds if he does not marry within the month. Despite the obvious choice, Evangeline (Macdonald) - a maid who loves the children, Cedric makes a deal with Selma (Imrie), who will make an excellent Wicked Stepmother.""Nanny McPhee"" is a movie that will be enjoyed by kids. It is mostly harmless and reminiscent of ""Mary Poppins."" Adults may not be as taken with it, but I do not think they will find it impossible to sit through. I recommend this for DVD viewing."
2,Too much of a bad thing,"There's no danger of this series ever becoming classic. I read the books first, which weren't easy to track down (I had to use Interlibrary Loans to find and get them). The books were atrocious to say the least. It was not difficult to reason why they were out of print and almost impossible to find. Why Emma Thompson would pick them to make into films is unfathomable. Although, admittedly, she did make the first movie slightly more palatable than the books she almost based it on.Barely watchable, it's not a keeper and I've no desire to seek out the sequel or the movie that's supposed to follow it."
5,Nanny McPhee DVD (Widescreen Edition),"If you don't just love Nanny McPhee you are considered a very old, grumpy person. Purchased it for my Grandkids, but watch it myself, when I have a minute and want to smile."
4,Very enjoyable.,I didn't have any expectations when I sat down to watch this. Emma came through with another very enjoyable film version of a book. I have to admit that I did secretly wish for a glimpse of a soft side to her. Stiff upper lip and all that. That being said it is a very nice story and a nice way to teach proper behavior.
4,Entertaining,"I found this film to be very refreshing after all that has been in the theatres lately. I am 72 years young and found it very funny and yet gave you a very good feeling when it was over, no sex, gore or monsters...very good for me and my family."
4,This movie is worth buying,"Nanny McPhee is successful on many levels, which is what makes it so appealing. The story is engaging, even for adults. The 7 children of recently widowed actor Colin Firth are acting out because of their mother's death. The actors are enchanting, from Emma Thompson to Angela Lansbury to the children. The setting (19th century England?) is visually sumptuous, as are the costumes and makeup. This movie recalls Mary Poppins, although it's not a ripoff of that movie.There's even a prosocial message buried within the story: Everyone, including children, has a need for structure, respect and love. Blended families might find this movie especially appealing because the concept of stepmothers is addressed gently but realistically.The only aspect I didn't like was the inclusion computer-generated animation on some animals. I would have preferred this to remain a simple, timeless story with elements of myth without a talking donkey."
5,DVD,"My DVD was in excellent condition when it arrived, and it arrived in a timely manner. Amazon.com is the best for online shopping."
5,Nanny McPhee,An excellant family movie. What a relaxing film for everyone who has children and needs a laugh. My shipment arrived in great condition.
5,Delightful family movie!,"Nanny McPhee is a top notch family film. My husband and I enjoyed watching it and I'm looking forward to sharing it with my son and his family. Cedric Brown's children are full of mischief. They continually come up with ever more devious ways to rid themselves of their nannies and to get their father's attention. Though they achieve the former, the latter seems to be beyond their capabilities. That is until the arrival of the magical Nanny McPhee. The 7 Brown children are determined they will not succumb to Nanny McPhee and will send her packing just as the did the other 17 nannies. They didn't forsee the power of her love and the pounding of her magic cane. But even Nannie McPhee cannot stop their father from marrying the dreadful Mrs. Quickly!! What will happen? Can the children save the day?"
5,"""This is just a fun movie which will be enjoyed by all!""","Off-the-wall parity of Mary Poppins. The kids are as good being bad as one could hope for. Emma Thompson plays the nanny with understated excellence. This is just a fun movie which will be enjoyed by all, but beware--it may very well give your younger kids some excellent ideas for misbehavior!"
3,"Not Bad, Not Great Either","My wife had seen this movie in the theater, and raved about it. When it came out on DVD I bought a copy and saw it for the first time. It is entertaining, but somewhat over the top in my opinion. The humor is rather ""in your face"". I actually enjoyed it a little more on the second viewing. The audio and video seem to be good, and it comes across well in surround sound.I think it leans a little toward the female audience because of Colin Firth. I have not personally viewed it in the presence of children, but I'm inclined to think that younger children would enjoy it. I'm certainly not ready to put it in the same class as ""Mary Poppins"".In general, I don't regret having added it to our collection."
3,Not Good for Children,"I enjoyed the movie but it is certainly not another Mary Poppins movie. I previewed it before allowing my grandchildren, ages 6 to 12, to watch it. After about halfway, I decided it was not suitable for children because the woman was showing too, too much cleavage for children to see. I don't even like looking at it, myself. The second Nanny McPhee was okay but don't let your children watch the first."
3,somehting for everyone,"THe movie was entertaining, and good gosh, dealt with brats that were actually handeled without a book on child psychology. Some of the scenes were silly, but it was entertaining, and fun to watch, Emma thompson, of course ,made the movie, followed by Collin Firth. The movie was predictable, but a nice slice of escapism. On the order of Mary Poppins, kind of an offbeat, but subtle version, that leaves you not feeling bad. That, in itself, is monumental."
5,Nanny McPhee..,This is an awesome movie. nanny mcphee is a great movie for the whole family child and adult alike will enjoy this movie over and over again. this is one of the best nanny movies i've seen in a long time. if you have not seen this movie then i recommend you do
5,One of the most charming films ever made,"This movie is destined to become a classic. It is clever, delightful, poignant and visually stunning. Every time I watch it I find something new that I had missed in my previous viewings. It simply has everything - including a spoonful of quirkiness.Mary Poppins (which never was my cup of tea) needs to move over; she has met her match with Nanny McPhee."
5,Excellent Paranormal Reference Book,I thoroughly enjoyed this fascinating book. It is interesting and informative about ghosts and the paranormal. I have had this book since 2002 and continue to use it as a primary reference book for the supernatural. This is the best ghost book that I have found so far.
3,good but no cigar,"this book is good, but i have read better in the Everything series. everything could have been expanded on."
5,Handy little pocket knife,Good quality steel. Nice knife to carry for emergency use. The clip loop on the end could come in handy.
1,Disappointed,"The stroller is great, but the brake is already broke after 4 uses and the stroller tipped over with my 13 month old daughter. But the stroller did move over gravel very well."
5,So easy to use!,"I got this rain hood for my Expedition Stroller and it works great! It is so easy to use. You simply slide it over the stroller, once the baby is inside, then you hook it under the front tire. Simple as that. It can be put on in seconds! And it certainly works as intended. No rain gets through this shield, even when it is really windy. I highly recommend buying this rain guard so you will be prepared to stroll in rain or shine. Just buy yourself a good rain coat!"
4,Can work with REGULAR stroller,"I bought this because it seemed way easier to slide over my regular stroller (Peg Perego Pliko) in the rain than other items I saw. When my son was smaller and in the infant seat it covered the infant seat and most of the stroller. Now that my little one is out of the infant seat, it works even better for the times when you have to leave the house but the rain is really bad. It is INCREDIBLY quick to just throw on in a parking lot. It's not that expensive, and to me it has served super handy. Would totally recommend it!"
2,Not Very Sturdy,"This rain hood is a great concept but the cheap plastic tears easily with normal use. Ours lasted about a week before the Velcro ties ripped off. The corners should be cloth, not plastic, in order to withstand stress. Otherwise, it protects your child nicely from both rain and wind and fits snugly over the Expedition stroller."
4,Combat fiction that's hard to put down...,"This book was definitely hard to put down, even at 500-plus pages! The characters are real and the action intense. Like most Americans of my generation, I have a good working knowledge of US involvement in WWII, but, until recently, have known little of what went on in the Soviet Union. The author describes the soldiers, equipment, and combat with authority. I liked the ending, although it wasn't what I expected. This is a great book for those looking for something other than textbook history of combat on the Eastern Front, and I look forward to reading the author's next book!"
5,Great World War II Fiction,"""Scars of Honor"" is an impressive first effort from author Faron Norris. The story is from a perspective not often found in World War II fiction, war on the Eastern front, 1943. The book deals equally with both the Russian and German sides of the conflict, with diverse characters in each army. There are several plot lines that the author manages to weave together in a convincing and compelling manner. Additionally, the author clearly knows his subject matter, because this fictional account is peppered with authentic details on terrain, tactics, and equipment.If you're interested in War on the Eastern front and World War II, this is a ""must read."" It's fast paced and exciting, and the storyline quickly unfolds to give you a real rooting interest, not just in the main characters, but in the myriad of lesser ones that inhabit this work. It's better than ""War of the Rats."""
2,not great,"I wish the author had used German ranks for the soldiers and officers. I have read elsewhere that members of the SS were not addressed as ""Herr."" The author constantly uses ""that"" instead of ""who"" when refering to humans."
4,Couldn't wait to get home...,to continue reading this novel. I have always been intrigued about the Eastern Front both as history text and in novel form. Novels (at least to me) are hard to find particularly in English so this came as a nice surprise. Good plot and the descriptions of an army broken and in retreat are very well done. The characters are real and their actions take in all sides of the human spectrum when at war where survival is key and hope is dimming.I would like to see another novel by this authorand hope that one is planned.
4,3.5 Stars - A Very Good Debut,"When does music become less about lyrics and more about atmosphere, feel, and production... For me, the Stills capture a fair amount of the latter, just as early REM did with incomprehsible lyrics. Enough to overlook their limits (often quite derivative, often lyrically mediocre, an over-reliance on production style vs. substance), and suspend judgment and just ENJOY THE MAGICAL MOMENTS... Hence the high rating.Hope they continue to evolve and develop more of their own identity. BTW, ""Of Montreal"" is my fav (and I am from Toronto!)Cheers."
3,so so,"I dont know why everyone is so excited about this CD. I know those reviews were written a while ago, so maybe they got caught up in the excitement. This CD is alright. I wonder if everyone who was so pumped on it still listens to it. Probably not. These guys need to define their sound a little more to move towards drawing from their influences in 80's rock and beyond instead of just imitating. They just dont stand out at all from anyone else. Buy a Joy Division CD instead, or try a slightly different angle like the Walkmen (similar, i guess a little, but more innovative). Dont get caught up in the hype, which i assume has cooled considerably by this point. Hopefully by their next CD they will have evolved into the band most of these reviewers seem to think they are."
3,Almost A 4,I like it....Its not a love affair yet but after a few more listens maybe it will be. I think that the stills have talent although I dnt think that the sounds are really orgional.I find it to sound a lot like the All American Rejects which seems to b an off the beaten path comparison but wat the haties....Sry about my spelling mistakes I am very slopppy....Agree or disagree with my review but have an opinion
2,rather generic,"Nothing really special, pretty generic sounding stuff. Only song that really catches my ear is ""Still in Love Song"".. looks like it was the only song recorded at a different studio, it definitely has a more progressive (maybe that the wrong word) sound to it, and the mix is way better too. The rest of the mixes have way too much ear bleeding top end, back off the treble guys, it doesn't make your music sound exciting. Most of the other songs are rather generic. I'd classify it in the not too many chords school of guitar rock /w uninteresting vocals.. same tempo, same chords, uninteresting lyrics.. don't even think to compare them to Radiohead, argh.. that person should be flogged."
3,A Disappointment,"I was honestly let down by this album. I bought it after only hearing ""Still In Love Song,"" and even though I didn't expect all the songs to be like that, or even as good, I was not prepared for how much inferior the other songs are. I was hoping it would be like a Bjork album; atleast one amazing song, a few great songs, and some songs that are still strong enough to make you wanna tell a friend about it. I'm not saying that this is a bad album, it just seems that their one hit on the CD sounds like it was written by another band. That one song is my type of music but the rest isn't. Once again, not a bad CD but just not my sound."
3,I'd actually give 3.5 stars,"Its a very rare album that is honestly worthy of 5 stars imho.If I had it to do over again, I'd go to itunes and download the 4 or 5 really good songs from this album and save myself some money. Good tracks are: lola stars & stripes, gender bombs, allison krausse, still in love song and yesterday never tomorrow. I've tried to get into the other songs but they fall flat so thus far I'd say this band is real hit or miss but that's just my opinion. My advice is go the stills website (just google it) and give their album a listen and make up your own mind - they have the whole album on their website."
4,updated Kitchens of Distinction,"Bought the record second hand based on a excerpt from a NME review on the sticker on the front so didn't quite know what to expect. But was pleasantly suprised - a pretty good album with some great songs. They sound very much like ""Kitchens of Distinction"" - a dense sound, with chiming guitars and a laidback vocal. It should sound depressing but the guitars somehow make it a happy sound. Check out any Kitchens album or ""Churchtown"" by Into Pardise if you like this"
5,Excellent indie/alternative rock album!,"This is an album you can listen to no matter what mood your in. It calms me and puts me in a good mood. The actual music is composed very well and the lyrics are wonderful and the two put together make such a wonderful album. I like that indie/alternative/new wave albums are coming out again and this is definetly the best I have heard. Its really hard to describe the music, because its something you can really feel, not just listen to."
2,Meh,"This album is alright, it's got a lot of potential in the band. Lola Stars and Stripes is worth it, for its sincere melancholy and atmosphere but the rest of the songs are a bit bland and blend into each other. A few stand out, and a few don't. Standard rock music in this age fare, you won't miss too much if you don't get it but once again, Lola Stars and Stripes is a nifty song. IT seems that they seem to lack inspiration for some of their songs, although this is certainly a lot better than many of the things coming out. If you have some money to spare and like their peer bands, buy it but don't expect them to sound exactly like Interpol/new Interpol band because they don't."
4,"Excellent, but lacks vocals of distinction","Musically, the band is excellent. I hear New Order as the most obvious influence, although they are not a copy of New Order by any means. Other comparisons come to mind, but have already been mentioned in the other reviews on this site. But I find the vocals lacking feeling, they don't really sell the goods. Will be interesting to see how they develop."
5,Yeah...its that good.,"Logic will break your heart is so incredible. The sounds that the band make are so clean and efficient, yet have a real sense of personality. It starts out with a bang and keeps it up for the final count. I really enjoy some of their breakdowns. Whether its jamming out or an easy going guitar that sounds beautiful. I have a real connection with this alblum for some reason that i always want to have it by my side. Maybe because...yeah...its that good."
5,Logic will definately break your heart,"The Stills are not just another Rapture or The Sounds (who I both love), or ""The"" band wannabes, they are a completely new sound. I guess you could call it dark disco-rock. The lyrics are fantastic, and the music accompanying it is equal in quality. Do not listen to this album once, or you will not like it. It took me 5 listens to get use to the sound, but once I did, I was in music heaven."
1,It was for my sister.,"I am sorry, but this was for my sister- she loves it! I have never tried it though."
5,"Lowdown, GritTY, & GRIMEY","A must for any fan of rap. Onyx comes with unmatched intensity, great beats, and hard punches'. This album is highly addictive so DJ's make sure you cop the 12""s also. DJ's/Turntablists don't sleep, they have the best raps to chop up. Trust me on this. PEACE!"
3,psgator,"Very nice CD. Nick Garret's voice is amazing.His rich vocal style is great. I liked him when he was with ""Amici Forever"", but this cd shows off his voice. He is beyond singing with a group. Nick Garrett can stand on his own two feet. He does not need anyone else.I wish to cd was a bit longer, with only 5 songs you start to really enjoy it, than it is over.May be next time"
1,never got this product,I cannot rate this product as I never got it and have not found an easy way to get back in touch with them to rectify the situation.
2,India made hella horn... Not that loud!!!,"The german made horn is very loud. My brother purchase the german made horn a few years ago and he still has it in his truck. That's why recently I decided to purchase one for my truck but I got the Indian made. The indian made horn still has the 500hz and 300hz tone however I was disappointed with the loudness and sound quality. It is about the same or a little louder than my truck's factory horn but not as loud as the German made horn. The sound quality of the Indian made horn is a little broken while the German made horn has a solid sharp 300hz and 500hz loud tone. I have the same horn setup with my brother's truck but his german made hella horn is way louder than mine. I envy my brother's german made hella horn. However, if you have a car, then this indian made horn will definitely be louder than your car factory horn."
2,Not that loud.,"purchased several years ago.pro: durable, good looking.con: not that loud and have same whimpy sound as o.e. (honda)."
4,use the relay!!,"the sound is much stronger when you take the time to wire up the relay. my toyota horn wire didn't provide enough power and left me with a half dead ""kirby the love bug"" sound... the relay is the right way for the best sound."
1,Hella SuperTone Horns,"Lousy DB output. I was told by a loacal 4-WHEEL OFF ROAD shop the Indian manufactured version is very poor quality (mine was made in India), but the German made version is much better. When I complained to the web vendor (linked through Amazon), they told me ""That is the way it is. If you don't like it, call Hella"". DON""T BUY THIS PIECE OF INFERIOR JUNK. DB OUTPUT WAS LESS THAN THE OEM HORN FROM AUDI."
1,Buyer beware!!!!,"Buyer beware!!!! regardless of the fact that the picture clearly shows the Hella horns with the Made in Germany label in the front, that is not what is sent!!I just received mine today and they are the crappy India ones, not the 118dB ones made in Germany.I would not buy from this company ever again"
4,I listen to this soundtrack all the time,"I am not sure whether some of the songs would make sense if you hadn't seen the movie, (especially the last track on the CD) but this is a great collection of funky music that ranges from folk to semi-punk as if you are sitting in a New York bar with friends."
3,Splish Splash Big Red Repeats,"Very disappointed with the Wiggles lately. It seems as if they are having troubles coming up with new tunes. There are only a few new songs on this CD. If you don't have any of the Wiggles CD's, I would highly recommend this one. Otherwise, beware as you might be purchasing songs that you already have."
1,"Don,t waste your money",This product failed to perform as advertised. The duct treatment spray nozzle leaks under the nozzle and wastes half the contents of the can. This is bad because the minuscule amount of product in the can is not near enough to do the job to begin with. The small amount of product that did get into the ducts worked for several days and then the duct odor returned. I contacted clean air about the problem multiple times and they never once responded. I contacted Amazon who had a local distributor send a replacement. The replacement can was depressurized on arrival and refused to deliver its contents at all. Amazon was contacted and they sent a credit. Don't waste your money like I did.
5,Great rifle sling,I'm using this for my muzzleloader. It is sturdy and comfortable. It has 4 elastic loops to put extra bullets or muzzleloader speed-loaders in.
2,"Nice BOYs pants, not true to size for girls.","These pants were advertised in the girls department. I bought these for my 12 year old daughter. Large was way too big for her. Had to send them back. My daughter is of average height and weight. (Maybe a little taller and thinner than average.) Product was fine, just too big."
5,Theology History Not a Mystery,"Mr. Placher had a unique ability to present a complex subject in an understandable, readable and engaging manner. I highly recommend this book for anyone looking for an introduction to the history of Christian theology. It also provides many references for those who wish to dig deeper on any facet of the subject."
2,THEOLOGY A LITTLE BIT DATED,"THE BOOK WILL BE USED IN A SUNDAY SCHOOL CLASS NEXT YEAR. I AM NOT A THEOLOGIAN BUT HAVE READ A NUMBER OF SCHOLARS IN THE PAST FEW YEARS, ESPECIALLY THOSE IN THE JESUS SEMINAR. I FIND NO FAMILIAR REFERENCES, NOR DO I FIND THAT THE THINKING IS CURRENT WITH THE MORE PROGRESSIVE THEOLOGIANS I HAVE COME TO KNOW THROUGH THEIR BOOKS, SO I AM DISAPPOINTED. HOWEVER, FOR MANY CHURCH FOLKS THIS BOOK WILL BRING A FEW CHALLENGING THOUGHTS. I JUST FIND MYSELF WANTING TO WRITE ""HOWEVERS"" IN THE MARGINS."
4,Skid Row live energy,"I had been looking for this album for years, and finally found it! It rocks! The only problem is that it's a little short, only six songs. I wish it would have been the whole set because it has so much energy and rock n' roll that it leaves you hungry. Being this short, it's a shame there's two cover songs on there, since Skid Row's own songs are so much stronger. Anyway, I'm very happy with this!"
3,Not a perfect fit.,"Arrived early and in good condition. Looks as advertised. It was a little ""tight"" when placing it in a 1998 Nissan Sentra. Works well, but doesn't mount fully flush."
2,Manito Movie Review,"Okay, so I purchased this thinking it was going to be awesome. It's not and far from it. I did not really like the characters (Franky G...), how it ended, or the acting by the ""actors"" portrayed in this movie. You can really tell that many of them have little to no previous acting experience whatsoever. The only thing I liked about this film was that you can hear different versions of Spanish being spoken in a somewhat realistic manner. I was a Spanish major in college and thought this was cool. There are subtitles when they are speaking in Spanish so you can follow along. I would advise anyone who is considering buying this to rent it instead. It is not worth buying."
4,aww so cute for xsmall dogs,got this for our 3 pound poodlebuster he looks so sophisticated and cute in this he is a poodle but looks like a york-poo n this is perfect for him
2,Burns out quickly,Very bright but burns out very quickly. maybe around 1/3 of its actual listed run time. It does the job though.
2,Not What I Wanted,"It came on time but it also came in a damaged box, which wouldn't usually be a big deal if it was for me, but I was expecting to wrap it as a gift for my sister. I was also expecting the lamp itself as it said ""HEAT LAMP"" directly on the box, and it was only the bulb. I was really disappointed with the damage and the fact that it wasn't what I wanted AT ALL I am sending it back to get my money back. I was so mad, now I have to get another gift for my sister in hope that I can find one that will ship on time."
1,bulbs are good but came in shattered,I've bought these from a pet store and they work well. thought id save some money n order them online but they both come in shattered... guess ill just pay a lil extra n keep getting em from the store.
2,Don't forget UVB,"Not a bad light BUT reptiles NEED UVB for their bones. You should look for a UVA/UVB light, more expensive but they last a long time and will help keep your rep healthy."
5,anthology of authentic Hawaiian treasures,"Kahauanu Lake is the grandfather of traditional hawaiian music in the modern era, who traces his ancestry to Kamehameha I. Although he acknowledges the need to have hapa-haole commercial hits (hawaiian songs in english; think Elvis) to welcome the uninitiated into the genre; he does not compromise authenticity in his songs many of which he wrote himself.This cd was selected as one of Hawaii's Top 50 cds by Honolulu magazine, deservedly so. Spanning his continuing career of over 50 years, his voice is smooth, soulful and sincere; the backup is intentionally understated, just a humble satisfying warm feeling of aloha.If you are going to get a Hawaiian CD this is it."
3,"GOOD SOUND, POOR GUIDE SINGERS",THE KARAOKE SOUNDS GREATI ONLY WISH THEY'VE CHOSEN BETTER KIDS TO SING THE GUIDE SONGS.I ONLY LIKED 2 SONGS OF THE LIST.
2,I sent it back!,"This is supposed to be a karaoke CD for kids, but not all the songs have printed lyrics. Isn't this what Karaoke is--you following along with printed lyrics? Do not buy this album unless you have the words memorized to the songs already!! This should not be marketed as a karaoke album."
4,old money/new revenge,"Rebeccasreads recommends MURDER ON THE GOLD COAST the second Lt. Matthew Alexander complex mystery about old money & new revenge. It doesn't help that the homicide happened in the District of Columbia's wealthiest neighborhoods, &, incidentally, in the home of the father who had rejected Matt's plea for his daughter's hand in marriage. Because of all the usual reasons: wrong side of the tracks, no money, no prospects, etc.While in need of a copy editor MURDER ON THE GOLD COAST is an absorbing winter's evening mystery."
5,Barbie American Idol Doll,"My daughter is six years old and she loves this doll. SHe loves singing into the microphone like she is a popstar. This toy is great ,lots of fun."
3,Some classic cuts let down by too much filler,"After what everyone else has said i think they must be listening to another album. Yeah this album is good at preaching a message but there has to be more than that and unlike ""It take a nation..."" this album features far too many weak songs. against that it opens brilliantly, and reaches a peak with welcome to the terrordome, an awesome song without question, but after that it tails off, and except for a few exceptions isn't much to hear at least until fight the power rounds things off in style. Still if you haven't got the best songs on this album already then i'd say its still a must buy, but otherwise i'd probably stay clear of this album."
5,epic hip hop,very happy about this purchase. It arrived in the mail super quick and well packaged. definitely great great great customer service.
4,Sad reminder of when rap was real,"Still one of the high water marks of old-school (ie: integrity-possessed) hip hop, both lyrically and sonically."
5,The First,In 1989 I got this tape 2 times....And a few weeks ago I got it on cd and its the real rap.hey its what its all about in tha hood......2day is a good day!
1,"Best of the Decade? Oh, what has happened?","Amazon.com regards Public Enemy as the best musical artists of the 1980's. These criminals crank out musically bankrupt albums which they load with explitives to attempt to cover up their dearth of musical and lyrical talent. Hatred of whites, Jews, honest work, the law etc. are what make up the bulk of their trite lyrics. As recently as the 1940's there was genuine musical talent in the western world -- what have we come to? I this the sort of ""art"" toward which we have to look forward in the coming century?""Good authors, too, who once knew better words / Now only use four-letter words / writing prose... / Anything goes...."" -- Cole Porter"
1,A BUNCH OF HYPOCRITES,"Anybody who likes this type of music should see a psychiatrist. Hateful, aggressive, when they called it rap they left off the C. This group in particular would have to be the biggest bunch of hypocrites in existence. They offer pious platitudes about how hard done by the African-American is while at the same time calling gays evil. That says it all, really. It would be a good thing if all rap music was dumped on a huge bonfire with this group leading the way."
1,RACISM IS ALIVE & WELL.,"Never excuse racism in the name of art. Many have heaped praise on these creative but racist rappers. I won't. Needless to say, if this had been recorded vice versa by ""crakas"", it would be universally condemned. That is a double standard I will not endorse. ""Elvis was simple... racist"" shows ignorance of the facts and a kind of twisted, racist/artistic jealousy. Chuck D., you can be obsessed with race and continue spewing hate, or move past it as Malcolm eventually did. Life is short. Do some good. Malcolm & Martin did. So did Elvis."
1,They beep out the cuss words.,Funny that there's an advisory label on the cover but they beep out the cuss words on Fight the Power. Wish I knew this before I bought the CD.
2,"Amateurish edition, unworthy of a great work","It's great fun to see a portable edition of the 'dixonary' as Thackeray's headmistress called it. However, this edition from the purveyors of the upscale office furnishings catalog needs a lot more editing and polishing. The Greek in the derivations, for one thing, is atrociously copyedited, replete with mistranscribed letters and spelling mistakes, and completely missing accentuation. This is unforgivable; Johnson, though no Classical scholar, tried to be scrupulously correct in his Greek spelling and accentuation. Johnson's English orthography is mostly updated to 21st century conventions, except when it randomly isn't. (The introduction says no updating has taken place. This is not true.) There is no information given about the editor, or his methods, which makes the whole work a bit suspect.There are much better editions of the 'Dixonary' out there. Please, find a better one!"
4,Pirate Ship,"My 8-year old son loves this ship. He had the Pirates of the Carribean model also, but this one is his favorite. There are a couple of pieces that kept falling off so I used a little model glue and they haven't given us any trouble since. He will never want to take it apart and rebuild it anyway so I may just glue it all. It is a cool ship!"
4,High quality with an edge of fun,"I ordered this book shelf for my 15 month old son who is into everything. I did not want a basic book shelf, but something that looked fun or unique. This defintiely fits the bill. It required assembly which was similar to putting together a puzzle (literally). It was a little shorter than a traditional book shelf, but this is perfect for a child to have easy access to. It does not tip over. The screws are all covered for saftey and blends in with the paint color so that it appears invisible. Very satisfied with the product. It was packaged well, no dents or marks."
5,Great Kids Book Shelf,"Pros: I really like the way it looks. Holds tons of books. It' s Sturdy. The colors are great, no chips. It is deep for the long books.Cons: It smells horrible when I took it out of the box. I let it off gas in the garage for 2 days, now that it is in my son's room can't smell it. You have to build it, Tall books can only go on the top shelf.Shipping was free and arrived in 3 days for me.Other than that I would recommend it!"
4,"High quality, cute book shelf","This book shelf is very sturdy, high quality, and easy to put together. We are using it as an accent piece for the baby's room. It holds many books of varying heights."
5,Great Craftsmanship!,I purchased the Primary Color Puzzle shelf for my son's room to house small toys and books and LOVED it so much that I ordered a 2nd one. It comes unassembled but requires a minimal amount of effort and time to put it together. I was very suprised at how sturdy it actually is and it is designed in such a way that the pieces actually lock together when you assemble it. There is no possibility of it coming apart if a child attempted to climb on it. The colors are very vibrant and it is so well made that it could potentially last many years. I would highly recommend the Puzzle Book Shelf for any child's room. You won't be disappointed!
4,"Solid, But Not Too Stackable","When I received my first set of bowls, one was broken, and Amazon sent me a new shipment upon notification. The bowls are thick (chunky) and rustic looking. My only complaint is that they don't stack well and take up excess room in the dishwasher."
5,"Seeing the ""wood from the trees"" with financial data","The business world is currently faced by concerns such as corporate governance, audit accuracy and management accountability. These concerns are affecting corporate and market credibility. There is a need for an investor tool kit to see the ""wood through trees"" within all the financial data that is currently available. This book provides the framework for just such a tool kit.Stockpicker will initiate a new method of company valuation. It provides a fresh look at the often forgotten, but extremely important measure of free cash flow.The Roadmap model addresses a complex problem by applying Theory of Constraints measures and pattern recognition. This enable focus by both an investor and the incumbent management on what the company should really be about.The release of this book is both though provoking and timely."
5,Marvelous!!,"Haggis has truly captured the basic, real, and invariable nature of Glengarry music. With a fresh perspective on traditional Celtic music and their own compositions as well, they have produced an album that represents perfectly the shape that Celtic music will take on in the time to come. A gem among gems."
1,Poorly edited,"This workbook is a great idea poorly executed. Some of the problems make no sense, and some of the answers in the answer key are just plain wrong. Math struggles are bad enough without having to struggle with poorly worded, unclear questions and incorrect answers. Don't waste your money or time on this workbook."
5,British training method,"Mr Barlow presents his training method in a very well organized and insightful way that makes training much less stressful for owners and dogs alike. Its all about the dog. The anecedotes he shares are hilarious and makes you feel that you're not the only knucklehead trying to train a dog. Follow this method and you will save a lot of money by not buying all the ""Dog training toys."" One of his key instruments is a rock! You'll girly giggle when you see how simple ""the rock"" works."
3,not enough heat,i have a 30 gallon tank and needed some heat for my crested gecko during the winter. I bought this and now i am stuck with it. had to buy more wattage to keep the tank above 60.
2,Beware of possible fitment issues...,"Although this part was listed as fitting my car (1990 Ford Mustang GT), this fuel pump would not fit my car without modification. The screen was mounted in the wrong direction. It seemed as though all the components of the unit were all mounted in the opposite direction."
5,Good product,Makes the skin very smooth. It does not make dry it out like many facial cleansing washes. I recommend it.
5,Awsome CD!,Sue Fabisch is clearly an unbelieveable singer with tons of talent. I'm suprised that she hasn't come out sooner. My whole family has several copies of her CD. Go Sue!
4,Where has SUE FABISCH been hiding?,"I love discovering new talent...and what a pleasant surprise NOW I KNOW is! I listened to some of the tracks..and just had to buy the CD...very inspiring, warm, and filled with emotion and love..and sue's voice is UNBELIEVABLE... i bought a CD for my mom as well...."
3,"Great concept, poor execution","After 4 classic albums in a row, this was a big letdown. What could have been a great collection of B-sides and other uncollected tracks somehow came out way too hit-or-miss. Highs (enough to recommend the CD) and lows abound."
4,Pretty good carrier,"This is a pretty good back carrier, especially for the money. The straps are a little flimsey, and I can't use it for that long without my back hurting, but my son is 22 lbs. and I don't have the greatest back. My husband really likes using it as well. My son LOVES being in it. I wouldn't use this for long periods of time (like if you're going hiking), but for short trips, it's great, especially if you can switch off with someone."
2,Great as long as child doesn't fall asleep,"I ordered this for my 11 month old son. My biggest complaint is that he sits so far forward that when he falls asleep he lays on the back of my neck. Very uncomfortable! The weight of the carrier does not shift well when putting it on my back. Also, the top seam along the back looks as if it is very stressed and might tear soon. I do like the way the weight is distruibted on my back and shoulders. I am planning on returning it and buying the KELTY TOWN backpack carrier."
4,Lovely offering from one of the world's underated talents,"Although I wonder why Amazon.com doesn't just offer the original Norsk ""Innerst i Sjelen"", I'm glad to see Sissel get some of the kudos she deserves. I've followed her career since 1986 when I bought my first compact disc ever, her self-titled debut album. With the exception of that first offering, ""Deep"" is certainly my favorite. It offers a wonderful fusion of Norwegian folk music with modern twists, and the simple, clear melodies that highlight her beautiful voice. My only gripe is the inclusion of Placido Domingo as a duet partner in the album's final track, a re-working of her Olympic ""Fire in Your Heart""...his presence seems a bit misplaced. Still, a wonderful album highlighting a wonderful singer."
4,The voice of an angel,"Beautiful album. Sissel has a speciel way of touching our hearts when she sings. For everyone who loves the voice of Sissel, I will recommend that you buy her new album - ""All good things"". Even better than this one.."
5,"Spectacular, stunning, angelic voice","Sissel will undoubtably become a hit in the US one day. One can only go so long without first hearing then falling in love with the voice of Sissel. The album, well it not only showcases her voice but also her talent. From the different languages she sings in, to the various musical styles she sings, this is one talented lady.One can only look forward to her first US album, due out sometime in the late spring or early summer of 1999."
4,A must have...,"Rhino Records pays a hard hitting rock tribute to LEO FENDER, the innovative 50's mass producer of guitars and amps. Hardly anybody in the music business hasn't utilized A Fender in some capacity. This disc gathers some of todays best(well, you know the names). All exhibit the exhuberance of the Fender immitated but never duplicated products. A feast for the ears on every track. Annotator Dan Epstein, a regular contributor to Guitar World guides you through!"
2,Not that great...,This bubble blower is not that great. THE DESCRIPTION FOR THIS ITEM IS VERY MISLEADING. It sounds as though SpongeBob blows the bubbles himself. He DOES NOT. He doesn't even really dance. When you press the button on the bottom of his stand he actually FLOPS around A LITTLE. His body parts are simply bungee-stringed together to make him move. The only reason I have even given a rating of 2 is because he is a good bubble blower HOLDER if that is what you are looking for.
5,The Hero and the Crown,"It was amazing! Suspense, Love, Action are all things you would find in this book. It's about a girl named Aerin who learns from a book how to fight DRAGONS! She also learns that there is still one great dragon named Maur. She learns that Maur has come out of hiding, and she sets out to go find him. The rest is for you to read, not me to tell you.If you like Dragons, Magic, and Castles, this book is for you."
5,Best book ever!,"WOW! I am a 13 year old girl and I found this was an amazing book! I loved it! I would recommend it to any girls (or boys) who appreciate strong female characters and good literature. With the media like it is, books like this should be cherished for having girls who are not just items. I really loved this book! I think Aerin is a very developed character and there should be more like her. Robin McKinley does a very good job of writing this, but it is hard to understand if you are not a very good reader. If you are, though, you will appreciate this very much."
2,Disjointed,"In my opinion this book was very strange. The story was unusual, but the thing that bothered me the most was the lack of character development. The first half of the book somewhat develops Aerin's character and as the reader you feel like you are beginning to understand her. Then, as you read the second half of the book, it's almost as if you are reading about an entirely different person. Her personality is so significantly changed, if it weren't for the same writing style, I would swear the book was written by two different authors using no collaboration.Would not recommend."
3,A Missed Opportunity,"Although Robin McKinley portrays a female heroine in a vividly fantastic world in Hero and the Crown, her character developments fall short of any kind of feminist agenda. McKinley creates a multifaceted novel in which she explores many different elements including romance, adventure, and action which are all encapsulated within the heroine's daring quest to find her female empowered identity. Unfortunately, McKinley fails at providing the reader with a sufficient female hero. Aerin works throughout the novel to create a strong female identity; however, this is compromised at the end when she gives up the power she has fought so hard to acquire. There was also a great disconnect between reader and all of the characters."
4,A Great Success for Any Girl,"Robin McKinley gives us a brilliant heroine in the form of Aerin. She does it all, fights dragons, wins wars, and picks up a guy. She has amazing self dependence, and a thirst to prove herself, which gets her into some sticky situations. The plot was well weaved, as there were many things going on, and it seemed countless climaxes. Aerin doesn't just get one adventure, she has enough to keep the reader enthralled throughout the entire book. You won't regret reading this one."
2,Boring.,"Going by all of the awsome reviews for this book as well as the many awards it won, I feel like some sort of froot loop.But I am two thirds of the way through and just cant take it any more. I find the prose chunky and laboured and hard to read. I have read dense, lyrical prose before and managed to get on board but this is not like that. I'ts just stiff and the sentences are way too long.The story is likewise annoying to me. So many pages are spent on the descovery of the fire-proofing balm. Then the main chick goes to hunt dragons and bla bla bla-dy bla. It's boring. Nothing much happens and that which does is'nt interesting. I'm sorry bit its so so soooo boring!I just can't finish it and really that is a big deal for me. I laboured through A Descovery of Witches right to the bitter end. Short as this book is, I honestly just can't face it."
5,Beautiful,"What can I say about this book? It was the first fantasy-sci fi type novel I'd ever read, before ""Lord of the Rings,"" before anything. For my impressionable mind this is more than a book, it is the standard by which I judge all other books of the genre that I've read.A standard few have equalled and fewer still have surpassed, and I often re-read it.I still have my first copy of ""Hero and the Crown,"" its pages are a little yellowed and ragged around the edges, but it still occupies the place of honor on my bookshelf, and it always will."
2,Not the Best by all Means,"I'm an eleven year old and I've been reading since age four and adult-level books since second grade. I read the entire Redwall series in a span of four months when I was eight. Now I personally love fantasy but I've picked up this book a few times to read but have set it back down after the first fifty or so pages because it was just too confusing and slow to start. This year I had no choice about reading it because I had to use it for a book report. Now I'm not saying it's totally bad, it does have its high points, but it is in my opinion extremely boring and confusing and tedious. Not exactly the type of book that I'd go around saying how wonderful it was by all means. I don't think this was a very good book and I don't know how some people can stand it. Although Mrs. McKinley does do a very good job writing her stories I think I'd suggest trying something a tad bit faster-paced and less confusing."
1,Yawn!,"OK, I really liked The Blue Sword, and wanted to know more of the story. This put me to sleeeep! I can't understand all the accolades, and I pity any poor kid having to read this for an assignment!There is very little action in this book, way too much description, and the first several chapters are incredibly slow. I kept reading 'cause I thought it would pick up somewhere, but it never did!Go read The Blue Sword instead!!!"
4,A great book after a cold start.,"This book has a somewhat boring beginning, but once you get towards the end of part one it gets very interesting. It is a very well written book that everyone would love. A good read!"
4,McKinley is a hero,"Have you ever read a book as a child that still managed to resonate as an adult? ""Hero and the Crown"" was one such book for me. I can still remember reading it as an 11 year old, and presenting a shoe box diorama of the showdown between Aerin and the Dragon in my reading class. While the strong feminist principles were not quite understood as an 11 year old, they are today. Even re-reading it now, you cheer for Aerin as she begins to understand her place in the world, and how what others say really doesn't matter. She longs to be more than the sum of her parts, and proves to be more than capable not only to herself, but to her father and the Damarians.Great example of Robin McKinley's writing, that transcends age and sex, and is a worthy adventure/fantasy for everyone."
5,Worthy of Praise,"In the Hero and the Crown, McKinley as usual creates a vivid, magical, seemingly real world with realistic characters that readers cannot help but feel attachment towards. This story is much darker and more ""grown-up"" than it's sequel The Blue Sword, but in being so it becomes to my mind the more superior of the two.I do give the book five stars as it is really a wonderful story, but again, characteristically of McKinley's novel, the reader should be prepared to be left with some unanswered questions and a bit of confusion as to how magic in the novel occurs. The only other obvious criticism with the novel is, at least to my mind, is that I found myself finding Tor less and less appealing as the story progressed and Luthe developed.Again, those are the only problems I found with this wonderful book. It is truly worthy of all the praise and honors it has gained."
3,Fair for a Fairy Tale,"An enjoyable read, great characterization, perhaps too skimpy with the plot, but a great summer read. Light and breezy, perhaps too much so for the serious die hard sci-fi fan, most young adults will probably find it enjoyable."
4,Good.,"I liked this book a lot, though I'm not sure if I liked it as much as The Blue Sword.I loved the begining, and the way it just drops you in and tells the story in flashbacks for basically the whole of Part One. I loved that first part, how it told of Aerin's childhood, and how she learns to swordfight and to ride. I can sympathize with how she was clumsy and such, and I loved how Tor always helped her when she needed it.I didn't quite like Part Two as much, I'm not sure why. It just seemed to drag on at some parts and then other parts seemed a bit rushed. That's why I didn't give it a full 5.But it's still a good book, and I really like Aerin. Perhaps even more than I liked Harry in Blue Sword."
4,compelling story,"This book has a compelling story that will stick with you. I read extensively, and I often forget books I've read, but this one dogged my thoughts for years until I finally bought it.This is classic girl-power fantasy, and although I wish McKinley would have explained the magic system better, the story is a definite keeper."
4,Goode's review,I had a hard time relating to the heroine at first but as the story progressed I became more sympathetic to her fate.By the end of the book I became very involved in her adventures.
3,Good strong girl heroine. A little confusing at time. Not as good as the Blue Sword,"I really wanted to give this more than 3 stars, but it didn't feel right. The story did not feel smooth. I have a hard time following at some points: like the surka wreath, [Spoiler:]what happen after she defeated Agsded (wasn't that a little too easy?), and what did she do that night with Luthe! I didn't like their feelings for each other. Tor has always been there for her. Not to mention the fact that she was immortal. Does it mean she won't age? What does it mean that her immortal part sleeps? Did she become mortal? If she did, how come she wasn't there in the Blue Sword?It's been a long time since I read the first book on Damar: The Blue Sword, and that book in my memory was ""The Book"". One of the best book I have ever read. I was disappointed that this one wasn't as good."
3,"Excellent at the begining, but a lame ending","When I started this book, at ten pages in I was captivated and thrilled to find a book that so fit my taste. From my point of view the middle was excellent. But I hated the end. It was seriously, seriously lame. I think that McKinley was trying to meet a dead line instead of writing a book. I'm 12 and have never published anything in my life but I can write a better ending."
1,I expected a full-size hardcover copy but got a paperback-sized copy with a hard cover over it.,I love the book but was very disappointed in this edition. It was intended for a gift and was not suitable for that application.
2,Fascinating story with very poor morals,"I love fantasy, particularly with dragons and horses, so this book had a special appeal to me, especially because it is so well written. Thus, I am very disappointed to have to give it only two stars. There are no good role models in the story and there is little stated difference between right and wrong. Some people are flirtatious, vain, and petty and the other people scorn them for it and are proud. Aerin disobeys her father on several occasions, if not directly she still does what she knows he wouldn't want. Though not graphic in sexual content, there is a lot of kissing and hugs, as well as premarital sex."
2,The Pointless Book,"This book was so boring. The novel is mainly character driven, and that is good for some, but nothing exciting happens. Yes, she confronts a wizard and dragon, but there is no reason for it. Not to mention that Ms. McKinley seems to have forgotten how to write after the Blue Sword. Deerskin was awful too, but back to the subject, Aerin is not a likable character. I don't know why, but it was impossible to connect with her. Ms. McKinely went on for pages stating and restating how awful Aerin's life was, when those pages would have better been spent of plot development. Two big events carry the entire novel. Other than that, it is just Aerin sitting around doing nothing. She for no reason decides to start killing dragons. There was not much to Aerin, she was a two dimensional character despite McKinely's attempts to bore us stupid with about 5 chapters that have nothing to do with the plot except to let us know over and over again that Aerin had a miserable life as a princess."
5,A classic for all ages,"I first read this book as a young girl and was fascinated by a rousing adventure story. As an uncertain teen, I was heartened by the courage of Aerin, who also felt out of place amid her peers. I had stopped reading it in high school due to my mistaken belief that it is a children's book; lucky for me I found an old copy at the library and picked it up out of boredom. As an adult, I am struck by the moving themes of alienation and inner strength that I can only now appreciate. In short, I love this book for a different reason every time I read it. I am reminded once more why I have read all of Robin McKinley's work. Anyone, male or female, adult or child, who loves fantasy and Good vs. Evil should read this book."
3,sold me old product :(,"I love The Balm and was pleased with the price offered by Beauty Bridge. It was disappointing however when my Balm Shelter arrived with a brush applicator. The Balm replaced the brush applicator with a wand at least four years ago. That means the two that I bought have been on the shelf that long. :( They were sealed and I am using the wand applicator from my last purchase but, I would have paid more for more recent product. I will not buy from Beauty Bridge again without thorough investigation."
5,neato,"this book has really nice pictures. glowing blass must be really difficult i think. i sure can't do it, though i've never really tried. but i don't think i could do it if i did try."
3,Do I recommend Spectrum? YES,"Steve's playing is delightful on this CD! Too bad the song writing isn't up to the same standard. This may have otherwise gone down as a classic. Regardless, this still is one of Steve's better releases and it will remain in my collection."
5,Loved IT!,I read this book in no time at all. What a fascinating man! I wish I could find more non-fiction books that are this interesting.
2,Not as pictured!,"Just got this seat, we were so excited to get it. I ordered this specific one because it has the belt across the swing with a snap clip. Well the one they sent us has the chain across the seat!!! NOT a belt like pictured. BEWARE!! The ropes are also about 6 feet long, I have to tie it in a knot 3 times to get it to the right height. You cannot adjust the ropes either! The chain across the seat is really long too, it hangs down and is not tight like in the picture, I have to loop it through and hook it to the chain. I cant even secure it to the hook they have because it is so long. If it was sent as pictured it would be a great seat! It still works but I have to rig it and that makes me pretty mad! I would reccommend getting the seat with a chain not a rope since they are going to send you one with a chain across the seat anyways!"
5,"Its Durex, what can I say",The condoms came in on time and were exactly the ones I ordered. These are pretty thin and one of the best out there.
2,doesnt look like genuine,"It doesnt look like the genuine durex I buy from the pharmacy. I am not sure.I can easily tear the outer cover(I cannot easily tear the outer cover of the ones I buy from the neighbourhood pharmacy), Also the material of the outer cover seems to be different than them. I am just being suspicious. Though I cannot say whether it is genuine or not."
4,Speciality is where to do.,"What differentiates this British born travel guide from the others: extensive coverage of the places to go and the places to be, specifically the bars and restaurants, cafes, where to hear what kind of music. The Time Out coverage is much more personal and extensive than the other guides, giving you places the other guides dont and a much more useful review. The guide to have when planning what you want to experience when not at the museums or the Palace (which is especially important in Madrid, where nightlife goes unitl dawn). A very good guide to have."
5,Happy with my purchase,I hit the gym as well as jog outside a few times a week only to stay in shape. Needed a digital watch with stopwatch and lap features. This watch is more than enough for me. The FLIX feature is nice to have. I like how the watch looks too. So overall I'm very satisfied with this product
3,"adequate, odd functional errors","Odd gas bubble sometimes shows up at bottom of display. Features are not completely intuitive, but if you need a count-down timer this watch is nice."
5,Timex ironman 100 lap flix watch,Great watch...bigger numbers and easier to see. has all the features!
5,Timex,"Liked it, good service, color ok, shipment on time, good price and that is it etc etc etc etc etc"
2,dies in ocean water,"To echo what some other have stated, I've had two of these watches and both times they died in Ocean water. If you don't plan on swimming in the ocean at all, this is a great watch. I really enjoyed the FLIX technology while it lasted. The other big drawback is the belt is proprietary and to replace, you have to order online or send the watch back. Real pain in the arse."
2,button stop working and wrist band broke,"The middle grey button stopped working after 3 years of daily wear. Tts metallic color coating began to discolor and reveal cheap black plastic underneath. Eventually, the wrist band broke off the watch and the battery died.Too much plastic and questionable components durability made this watch average, even though it does deserve 3 stars for simple and large time display."
1,Mine was garbage.,"I wore this watch for around two years. The buttons will eventually stick and one even stuck permanently. At that point pushing any one of the buttons would cause the watch to reset. This was the third Ironman I've owned since 1996 and two of the three were complete junk. Timex's newest Ironman looks like a cool watch, but I want something more durable."
5,Always love a new ironman,"I spend the fifty or so bucks for a new ironman every two years ... and it lasts about that long.In two years the face will be scratched up but the electronics work fine. Also, somewhere within two years the band will break and a replacement band is about twenty bucks by itself. If the band breaks that means a new watch for me.So, the drawback on this watch is usually the band.For the most part though, if you want a good, accurate, disposable beater watch, this fits the bill."
4,"The watch is good, the band is not","No complaints with the watch, but the band... It's cheap plastic/rubber. It is uncomfortable. It pulls my arm hair. It causes me to sweat underneath. I changed the band for a canvas band and it is a great improvement."
2,Drowned after 19 months,I loved this watch up until the time it died last week while snorkelling on st. John.The features are great and the face is very easy to read in most lighting conditions. Lots of alarms.I've owned several Ironman watches over the past 20 years but this is the first one that failed in water. This is very disappointing!
3,It was shipped with a dead battery,"The watch is great but when it arrived (and was given as a Christmas present), the screen was blank. It turns out the battery shipped with the watch was no good. We could have returned it. Instead we just bought a new battery ... but we shouldn't have had to do that. It appears to be a quality control issue ... somebody obviously wasn't checking that the product worked before it was sold and shipped."
4,Good watch not so good band,"This is my fifth Ironman watch, same model. The band(see below) breaks about 1 year after purchase. The part that breaks is the half moon shaped rubber piece that holds the end of the adjustable side of the band against the side of the band with the buckle. Super glue doesn't repair it so I just buy a new watch. It's not worth the hassle to send it in to Timex for a new band. Maybe that is the strategy."
2,"Great features, POOR Construction","I've had TIMEX Ironman watches for years. This one has some of the best features yet for the price. Dual time zones, intervals, and many alarms and timer modes. It would be a 5-star watch IF it wasn't put together so bad. With the construction it lasts about a year at a time. The first one I had broke the loop that you tuck the excess strap in when you're wearing it. This made the strap stick out and get caught on things. The only way to fix it was to order a new strap which cost about 1/3 of the watch price. That happened in the first year.The second year the black frame around the face started coming off because the adhesive wore out. After two years I tried buying another one hoping that it would do better. Well it has been 11 months and the little loop that holds the excess strap has broken again..."
5,Awesome Watch,"This is a great watch. It seems big at first but it is surprisingly light. Its been well over a year now and it looks good as new. Its a very user friendly watch and i have never had any problems with it. If you want a solid, simple watch, this is for you."
4,Nice Watch,"I ordered this watch to replace the Timex digital that I had been wearing to work for more than 5 years that suddenly quit. This watch looked to be the closest match. The new watch came very quickly and was easy to set up. I really like the FLIX feature, it lets the back light come on just by flicking your wrist. I have used the timer function and it also was easy to set up and use. If you want a simple to use watch with nice features, this is a good one."
1,Defective display,"Just got this watch and its now back in the box to be driven to the post office for return. The display is defective. The middle horizontal lines for the main display and the hundreds display is missing. In other words 8's look like 0's, 3's look like backward C's etc. OK so its defective, it happens, but what causes me to write the review is I don't see the slight darkening where the horizontal lines should be. I can see in the LCD the circuit traces that make all the lines that do display but no ciruit traces for the missing horizontal lines. Clearly, I could be wrong but this doesn't seem like an instance of a wirebond breaking on my paticular watch, it seems like they printed the LCD wrong. If that's true they might have made thousands with this defect."
1,Strapless Timex Wristwatch?,"The attachment between the strap & the watch on the Timex Men's Ironman 100-Lap FLIX System Watch #T5E231, was badly designed and the first time I wore the watch, the strap separated from the watch when I tried to open it. It could not be reattached securely, so the watch can no longer be worn as a wristwatch."
3,watch,"Have not really had the product long enough to give a full and accurate review, Ask again in one year."
5,Lots of Alarms,"I am an older woman and I purchased this watch because of the large display and lots of alarms. I care for an elderly family member and we do IV antibiotics at home instead of the hospital. When I learned of a new antibiotic that had to be run every 6 hours I knew I had to find a timer watch that allowed me to work around the house and yard without missing a timed antibiotic. I tried using a timer in my pocket and around my neck, but once they accidently get touched at a button I lost the time and messed up on the timed antibiotic. This watch is great, I can work with the timer going on the watch and the buttons are not not easy to accidently get pushed from working around. It gives me peace and freedom to get almost everything done without mistakes. When it comes to someone you love, you don't want to mess up."
5,really like this watch,"A VERY good watch for the price(saw it priced in stores for $69.99). The large digital display numbers are helpful, and it is easy to rotate back and forth between functions."
4,Bom relógio,"O custo benefício desse relógio é incrível, tenho esse relógio desde 2008 (3 anos) e ele ainda funciona muito bem. Só tive que trocar a pulseira porque ela arrebentou com o uso, além disso, já troquei a bateria uma vez também.Ele é bem básico e possui todas as funes básicas (alarme, cronmetro, timer etc). Gostei da funo dele de gravar os tempos, como eu gosto de correr, é possível guardar todos os tempos das corridas e ele ainda calcula o tempo médio das voltas e o tempo de cada volta.No geral gostei, no é pequeno, mas também no é grande demais, um relógio de homem e bom para esportes."
5,Featured and Easy to Use,"An excellent and well priced watch for running/jogging and anywhere you need a good stopwatch.Comfortable on the wrist, and well fitting for a medium sized male arm.Lovely large display, with configurable options on what items to show in the Chrono function, ie if you want the large display as lap time, splits, total time etc.Relatively intuitive, although a rather cumbersome large spreadsheet instruction manual could be better presented as a small bookletIndiglo night light is excellent for a night run, with the flix option once activated easy to use and quite handy!Haven't taken it swimming or in water, but it certainly stands up to a good deal of sweat without issue.Overall a solid watch for those just wanting to keep things simple and record time (and not distance/gps or heart rate etc)."
3,Good watch but strap should last longer,"I have used this watch for over 3 years and I'm on my second one. The numbers on the display are large and the indiglo feature works well (though the center button at the bottom does not activate it which does not make sense to me). I wear this watch every day and, given it's a sports watch, I'm puzzled by the band which lasts around 1yr. I purchased a replacement last time but I doubt I'll do that again as the indiglo feature wears out around 18 months. Overall, a good watch but with these weaknesses."
3,Watch,Time switches from the first time zone to the second without notice. A defect that should be corrected. It gets confusing when the time switches. I would not buy again.
3,The watch stopped working after only 2 years,"I purchased the watch in March 2010. It is a great watch with many useful functions. However, it died in March 2012 - 2 years??? My last Timex Ironman watch lasted for nearly 10 years. Not sure I will try another one."
3,What's the use of alarms and timers if you can't hear them?,"It had everything I wanted - I had looked at dozens of different watches and this is pretty close to perfect, except for one thing: I can't hear the alarm if its not absolutely quiet. I admit to a mild hearing loss, but my other watch I can here, and others have reported the same in their reviews. I am returning it, and selecting this watch instead, with both vibration and a louder alarm.Timex Men's T498549J Rugged Digital Vibration Alarm Watch.For those needing an interval timer with a really loud beep and a vibrating alarm, look for interval timers in Sports & Outdoors, such as theGymboss MAX BLACK SOFTCOAT"
2,Poorly designed,"I am stunned that so many rate this watch so highly. One reviewer said """"The beeps are very audible and hard to miss in a normal street environment"""""" this is extremely exaggerated. I returned the watch because the beeps are so low volume you can barely hear them. The alarm is ok, but the beeps between intervals are pathetically low volume.Watch programs are 1989 all over again. Timex needs to get into this century and put real software on their devices"
5,Epic Watch,The watch works great. I went kayaking over the weekend and it got wet and kept on tickin'. Love all the features. Great price for all the features. Love this watch!
5,Running,"This is one of the better in a long line of Timex Ironman watches that I have used over the years. I seem to get better longevity out of my watches and bands than many of the reviewers, but it is not because of lack of use. I run +-40 miles a week and use the watch for work as I have to log times accurately throughout the workday. Bold and large letters for my old eyes are easily seen in daylight and the Indiglo is noticeably improved over my last watch. It was, in fact virtually useless on that watch (Way too dim). The Flix feature works well and I expect to be using it more as the days are getting shorter. Still room for improvement on the Indiglo brightness factor, though. Controls are the same as always so there is no learning of new ways to get the same old info and button sensitivity is perfect. With 100 laps and workout storage I have plenty of room for my workouts. I am completely satisfied with this one! As long as it holds up, that is!"
5,Great Watch that has lasted for for years,I was just looking for an old product in my amazon order history when I saw this watch. I ordered it over two years ago and am still wearing it. It still looks and works as well as the day I bought it. I never wrote a review for it - I'm giving it the 5 stars it deserves.
3,poor band quality,"I purchased this watch about a year and a half ago and have been through THREE wristbands thus far. For the cost of replacement wristbands, I could have bought a new watch. It's a shame to have to buy a new watch because the wristband can't hold up to normal wear"
5,Just what my husband was looking for,Great item...This watch has everything you would need...Looks great..No problems and the service and shipping was good and fast. Best part is the quality you receive for your money with watch.
5,Timex Men's Ironman Triathlon 100-Lap FLIX System Watch #T5E231,Timex Men's Ironman Triathlon 100-Lap FLIX System Watch #T5E231is the best watch I have ever had. The face is the largest I have seen. It is easy to read in reduced light conditions. In a run with multiple laps it not only gives the time at each lap but also the average of each lap and the quickest split. I would buy another. Delivery was prompt.
4,"good price, fast delivery","Much better price than at Target and no hassle (Target only had displayed and running item of uncertain battery usage and bad sales support). However, there was no choices on colors (only black offered)."
1,broken in less than a year,"Like the rest of my Timex watches, this one didn't even last a year. Its not the battery, these are junk. Time to switch brands."
2,Face is too big & FLIX turns off each day.,"I like the watch just wish it didn't have such a bulky look and feel; the watch face is about 1 3/4"". My major complaint is the FLIX mode turns off each day when the Night-Mode resets/turns off each day. You have to remember to turn on Night-Mode before you can use the FLIX action; these two modes should be independent. It's irritating to try and use the FLIX action at night to find it disabled!"
4,Timex Men's Ironman 100-Lap FLIX System Watch #T5E231,"This is my second time I purchased this model Timex watch. I never take it off and it takes a lot of abuse. After 3 years the one strap broke but I believe i caught if on something very sharp to have that happen. I purchased it again because I liked the overall performance and functionality and although I have had a couple issues with the crono start/stop buttons, I prefer it enough to but it again."
5,Great watch,This is the second Timex Ironman Triathlon 100 lap memory that I have purchased. I love the big numerals and the excellent way it keeps time. Very very please
1,Not water resistant,"I love the big display. I really wanted this watch to work.But this is the 2nd timex that got water in it from the shower.This happened to my daughter also.My first Timex lasted over 5 years.After that watch the next two leaked after less than a year.I don't think the quality is there anymore.I'm going back to Casio, it worked 100 ft. under watereven pushing the buttons!"
5,Favorite watch!,"My first watch of this kind got ran over by a car (no... thankfully it wasn't attached to my arm at the time if was run over), but that meant I needed a new watch. After looking around for the kind of watch I wanted, I couldn't find one better or more valuable than this guy."
4,Timex Men's T5E231 Ironman Traditional watch,"I bought it for swimming in the ocean. It offers some basic options for measuring the time, laps and intervals (although it has the traditional functions as alarm, two time zones, backlight, memory for storing laps, etc.). The reason why I only give 4/5 rating is that the paint starts to peel on the plastic parts. However, it is still waterproof and works (so far 100 miles of swimming in the ocean in ~ 1,5 years)."
2,slow,"I have owned several timex ironman watches over the years. Loved 'em all. I don't if amazon sent me one with an almost dead battery, or if it's a flaw in the watch. However, when punching through the modes, everything is REALLY SLOW. If I go to alarm, I have to wait a few seconds for it to appear, then wait a few more when I choose to modify it. Not quick an easy like my other ironmans. Great features though, if it wasn't for this annoying delay, 5 stars easy.So I don't know to blame amazon or timex for this. Either way, it is a problem that dropped the score for me."
2,Lasted 2 months,"I love the look of this watch, however, mine lasted two months and then I couldn't change the mode - it is currently stuck in CHRONO mode and I can't switch it back to TIME (or any other mode). CHRONO mode isn't even working - the watch is ""frozen"".Amazon is taking it back and I am ordering a new one - hope it lasts longer than two months!? If not, it will be my last TIMEX."
2,"Looks great, poor quality","I love the way this watch looks and the buttons are intuitive and quick. However, within one month the buttons froze and I couldn't make any changes. When I took it apart and removed the battery temporarily, it all started up again. BUT, it was no longer water-resistant and after getting some moisture in it, the display doesn't work. Since I took it apart rather than a Timex dealer, it is not warranteed."
1,Watch Freezes,The Ironman is a nice watch when it works. Twice it has 'frozen' up on me... none of the button would work. I had to remove the battery and put (the same battery) it in again to make it work. Search on the web shows the freezing of the is not an uncommon problem. I cannot recommend this watch until the problem is fixed.
3,Works great for limited purposes,"This was a handy device to have when I started exercising, but quickly realized other features that would be helpful, and found another device that had those attributes. Watch face is large and uneven facing the hand, so bruised the top of my hand while surfing. (Think of wrist in pushup position with big thing on wrist poking into top of hand.) So, had to buy another watch for surfing. Bummer. The best thing about this watch is are the interval timers.BTW, I upgraded to a Garmin 4 Runner, which has all kinds of fun features like Google Earth, heart rate monitor, MPH, elevation, calories burned, and a computer program you can download info to. If you click ""See all my reviews"" above, it can take you to that product, which is deeply discounted on Amazon. Can't say enough about that product."
1,Not so great,I bought this for my husband after reading many reviews on line. I want to send it back. Does not switch from am to pm. The stop watch mechanism does not work. Looks good but not good quality.
3,Very good watch but soft screen,"Terrific number size for visuals while running. Watch retains terrific aspects of previous generations - light weight and countdown timer. However, the screen is WAY too soft and is really easily scratched. If you can be tough on watches like I am you really can't wear it other then when running."
3,"Decent watch, floppy wriststrap","Bought this for my husband. We both really like the form function and features of the Timex Ironman watches (between us, this is our third). However, the wriststrap on this model doesn't close securely. The little holder for the extra part of the wristband is too loose, so it continually comes undone, with the ""extra"" length of strap flapping around. This makes it really annoying for swimming / running. As a product marketed for triathletes, this is a pretty big miss. I'd buy another Timex Triathlon watch in a heartbeat, but knowing what I know now, wouldn't buy this model again."
1,Great till fried,"I enjoyed this watch for about 9 months until it fried on me. I was snorkeling in the Virgin Islands and noticed there was some water in the face. I thought maybe there was another compartment to protect the inner workings... I was wrong, it died within a couple minutes. I did notice the back of the watch says, ""Water resisant to 100 meters"", maybe they added a couple extra zeros by mistake. I liked the big display for working out, and the alarm for camping, but the paint had started to chip on the start/stop button. Can't say I would recommend it."
5,Easy to read & use.,Easy to read while on the move. Plastic band should stand up well to warm weather workouts. Happy with decision to purchase this watch.
2,Prefer other Timex Ironman watches,"I have owned various styles of Timex Ironman watches over the years and this is my least favorite for three reasons. First, the START SPLIT button sticks out so far that it often is accidentally pressed long enough to switch the watch to Time 2. Other models don't suffer from this design flaw. Second, the INDIGLO on the watch is far less visible at night than previous versions I've had. Third, the clasp that holds the end of the watch band is too loose and I often find that the end of the watch band is getting caught on things.Even though I just purchased this watch three months ago, I am purchasing a replacement for it already because the design flaws are too annoying. My next watch will be a Timex Ironman but a different model."
2,Practical watch marred by easily scratchable display.,I like the big digital display of the time with all the pertinent info (day of week/month). The big gripe I have is how easily the display can be scratched. For watches at this price range maybe they all suffer the same flaw. I would have paid more for a tougher display glass.Edit: wore the watch in the pool and jacuzzi while on vacation. Noticed moisture under the display and watch stopped working. Died after 18 months and out of warranty.
4,Very good product,"I've had Timex Ironman watches for a number of years and they have evolved in a good way over the years to be more practical and easy to use. I use this watch for swimming and running and the features are easy to use and understand. The battery life seems to have improved over previous versions of this watch, which is helpful because changing the battery is awkward. Also updated over previous versions are the button functions and locations. replacing the start/stop and lap counter side-by-side arrangement with a start/stop on the lower right side and a large lap counter at the bottom of the dial is a positive change. This avoids inadvertently pushing the start/stop button when one wanted to mark a lap. The only issue I have with these watches is that the band tends to wear out before the watch and I've had to replace many of them. But all in all, this is a very good product and I'm very satisfied."
3,Nice looking quality should be improved,"It' s nice looking , but quality is not as good as expected. Plastic is cheap and seems to be a toys"
2,water resistant my...,"I had this product for a little while and it was working great. However, one day when I was spearfishing the screen cracked and water got into it. It was all down hill from there. The deepest I dove with this product on was no more than 40ft, which is well below what it claimed it was capable of. Now this watch is somewhere in the Atlantic."
5,Great Watch,"Great watch has heaps of features, really simple to use. I was worried that pressing the buttons in the water might damage the watch when doing lap counts, but I've had no problems. Looks great, comfortable, and light."
4,So far so good,"The watch is very legible and comfortable the wrist band is pretty thin so I can foresee this being a potential problem as far as durability of the band is concerned. Overall, I'm happy with my purchase and enjoy the flix technology."
2,too expensive,"I definetly thought it would be tougher. Not that the watch has broken down or anything. However, I bought an addidas watch in an outlet and it outclassed this watch in everyhting; style, features and sturdiness. (and it was only 30 dollars)Don't get me wrong guys the watch is useful and looks nice, but I dont think it will last as long as the other. Will keep you posted on the developement of this watch :)"
1,Buttons froze after only 3 months,"I have been a runner for 20 years, and have perhaps 5 Ironman watches. They have always lasted at least two years, working without any issues (I may have lost them, or the battery died). However, I have had this one only since October, and yesterday the function buttons stopped functioning for no apparent reason. I will not buy another Timex watch again."
5,Much Better Looking in Person,"I exchanged another watch for this one and am very happy with it. It has a large display, easy to read when you're active and moving around. I'm glad I bought it."
4,Great watch,"This watch is awesome - does everything as advertised. Light weight - you don't even know you have a watch on. The display for the time is HUGE. haven't really had a need to use the flick feature yet, but it seems to work well.Only minor beef with the watch is the strap - the loop that holds the end of the strap has a small tab in it, designed to catch one of the band strap holes. That works, but it can be a pain in the backside to get the strap off. I suppose I could cut that tab off with a sharp knife if I wanted to."
4,Great for swimmers!,"Got this watch for my birthday in June 2010. Been using it for a month, I swim 3 days a week and have had no problems. Only wish that the lap counter (chronometer) would not only show me my lap times, but also show my average lap time over my whole work out. That is why I held back from 5 stars."
5,Good Watch,I have had this watch for over a year now without a problem ... i like it a lot! Big display!
4,great watch sucky band,"This is a great watch. It is much improved over the ironman that I had years ago. The Lap memory is great for training whether swimming, running or other sports. The one downfall of this watch as far as I could see is the band. The band ""strap"" on mine broke after a few months (replaced with carefully crafted black electrical tape). Then the band started to break down and crack over time. Over all the band lasted about 1.5 years which maybe is all one can expect if you wear the watch 24-7, however, to me it was disappointing. The watch band is nice and smooth though unlike its other older models that had a lot of grooves to collect soap scum, sweat, and grime.The bands aren't too hard to find on line although the store at my local mall didn't have them. $23 later and I am back in business....."
3,Button got stuck,"I bought this watch 3 month ago. I have been enjoying a lot with this. I have to admit this is pretty cool watch. And really good price.But from last week, i couldn't stop alarm because one of button got stuck. I found this is known problem in this model after googling. I'm very moderate user.Be aware about this."
2,Fix the Band!,"Love the watch, hate the band. On my third band in two years. I do not abuse it, just a poor choice in materials. Had the same problem with a previous - similar watch from Timex. Keep in mind Amazon also charges something like $12 for the band along with $5 for shipping."
1,Leaker,"I loved the functions, but too bad it leaked within the first couple of months. I could first see moisture under the glass and the indiglo light quit working, but it would actually dry out after a few days, so I tried to live with it. Unfortunately the leak got worse and now it is mostly full of water and none of the digits are legible, but worst of all the warranty is now expired. What happened to the slogan ""takes a lick'n and keeps on tick'n""? I guess Timex has followed a lot of other US companies; cheap low quality products made in China."
1,Broken in three months,"The watch works fine in the first two months, then one day the backlight went on automatically and there was no way to turn it off.After 2 days, the watch was dead! So if you don't want $40 wasted, keep away from the watch."
2,TIMEX Ironman,Bought the watch in Jan of 2011. Stopped working in 2 months. Very light use. The buttons are all stuck/not working. I am going to try and return it for repair but really frustrated.Follow upTIMEX refunded the cost of repair and the new watch is still working several months later.
3,Get what you paid for,"It feels a bit cheaper than the Ironman Sleek 50 watches i've owned the last couple of years but I guess the saying holds true, ""you get what you paid for."" I bought this watch since the band will likely break and I'll have to buy a new one in a year anyway. Functions are the same as the Sleek 50. I think I preferred the slimmer watch but that is just preference. I'm hoping since the band is a bit thicker it will last a little longer. We'll see..."
3,There are better and there are worse.,"This is a decent durable inexpensive watch. There is nothing spectacular about it, but it does everything you need. My only real complaint is that unlike other Ironman watches the start/split button is not recessed. Why is this a big deal? When you hold down the button it changes the timezone you are in and shows a different time. I travel a lot and like this feature, but I don't like it when it constantly is changing on its own simply because my arm is laying against something and hits the button.It is a decent watch, but I would not buy it again."
2,Great functionality but poor quality,"I've gone through three watches - each one lasted less than a year. For what it does - timing excercise routines and so on - it's great - but it's a cheap, crappy quality watch. The strap fails, the watch electronics die, the buckle dies.Two stars because the watch did function for a few months, all three of them. Now I'm looking for a better more expensive watch which will last at least three years!"
2,Timex Ironman watch,"This is the fourth Timex Ironman I have owned. It is not as advertised. I asked for a wrist wrap/velcro wrap watch. I received a normal wristband with holes.Also, the Timer feature has no tone at all. I really liked all my previous Timex Ironman watches, but this one has minimal instructions for usage. I am having trouble figuring out whether it works or if it has manufacturing defects.I hope there will be support for how to use this watch (with the wrong wristband)Help please, Amazon."
4,Good Watch!,"Happy with the watch. Large display and functions I can definitely utilize in my swimming days to help me count laps. Two time zones. Like always Amazon excels at customer satisfaction and Timex as most of us know is a dependable watch. I like the size of the digits, I just do. 4 Stars for the Timex Men's Ironman Triathlon 100-Lap FLIX System Watch # T5E231."
4,Economy watch; gets the job done!,"Simple to use for just about anybody. Looks okay, but the belt looks and feels too toyish. However, if you are looking for an inexpensive digital watch with no non-sense functions that'd last a long time, I think this watch will serve you well."
4,"Terrific watch, but complicated","I bought this watch specifically because I believed it could be set to beep at 1 minute intervals for interval training while running. I still haven't figured out how to set it for interval training. I think it can do it, but frankly, the instructions are complex and ambiguous. Another thing - I can't get the FLIX feature to work. It's supposed to illuminate at the flick of a wrist, but it won't do it for me. Probably operator error again. Other than that, it looks good, feels good on my wrist, and I never worry about it."
3,Watch,The watch is a little more basic than my last one. The numbers are the largest ever on a watch. I can see it without my glasses. Overall it is fine. The service was good.
5,Good price and product,Better pricing at Amazon than through my training program or locally. Works perfect for interval training.
2,Looks good. doesn't last,I wore this watch when i run trails thru the forest and when I play sports and sometimes the beach. I do likke this watch but it lasted 6 months. i was hoping it lasted longer.As others have sated:1. the pin for the band does come out and will need to be replaced or fixed regularly. So it can't take a battering.2. The LED will go. And the part is no out of stock.3. The indiglo Flix is a massive cumbersome difficult thing or skill. I think I got it to work once.4. The buttons can be tricky but not tooo difficult.For the price I still won't buy it again unless they remove that 'Ironman' tag.
2,Disappointed in durability,"I was pretty confident getting this watch after seeing several friends use it. It has a very easy to use alarm, the indiglo is great, and the timers and countdowns work easily.My disappointment with the product surrounds the warranty and durability. The watch comes with a 1 year warranty and thirteen months after purchase it is dead. I only wore the watch about 5 hours a week while cycling. Pretty gentle wear and tear. When it died I replaced the battery and it clearly has power now, but it is toast."
5,Great watch! Just what I was looking for.,I had a few requirements when looking for a new watch ... 1. Multiple alarms ... I use them as reminders for things. This watch has five alarms.2. In interval timer ... for training. This watch allows for nine intervals. I think the FLIX deal is a bit of a gimmick and I don't use it much (since it doesn't take a whole lot to just push the button) and I like that the display is nice and big. I'm experiencing the normal dependability and durability that I've seen in previous Timex watches. This watch meets all my needs and I'm glad I bought it.
1,Keep Your Receipts,"Too bad I didn't keep my receipts.This watch has buttons: recall, indiglo, stop, mode, and start/split.But the most important button is mode. That's what controls whether you see or adjust your time, chronograph, alarms, etc.For no apparent reason, my mode key ""froze"". (Trust me, there was no abuse on my part.) The mode key can normally be pushed, but I would certainly need to be an ""ironman"" to push this button in so that I can use it.The reviews for this watch were great, I guess I got the bad one. Just keep your receipts."
2,it's okay - band problem,"it's an okay product. Easy to read screen, which shoes date, time, day of the week.The rubber band is soft and will break after a year of tough use. Then I bought a G-Shock- Casio Men's DW5600E-1V G-Shock Classic Digital Watch"
3,expect to get about two years and then replace,"Even though I only give it 3 stars I am planning on getting another one. My biggest complaint is that the battery lasted less than two years on my latest one. (I have owned two or three). I replaced it, but I think I bent the cover because of the way the band is, and the battery just died after two days. I think it is because I got some water in there when I showered. The one before I took and got the battery replaced and they took off the band, but the sound stopped working. I use this as my alarm clock, so it was useless without sound. So don't plan on just replacing the battery.My other suggestion is that you set the time zones the same because I have had mine switch because the front silver button was depressed and I didn't realize it. Not a big deal though.Other than that I love the watch and all the features. The interval timer is a little confusing."
4,Timex Ironman 100 Lap Full Size (T5E231),"This is the 3rd watch I've had of this series. I like it because of the large digits and the features. It has worked well for the 4 months I've had it. The other 2 lasted about 2 years each and then the display lost some lines making them useless (no warning). I love the strength and durability of the watch band EXCEPT the loop that holds the end of the band in place - it breaks very easily and both of my other watched needed a second band at $15 each, and then they were ready for another one when the displays failed. The old Timex Ironman watches went through watch bands every few months.The watch is very easy to use and to see, making it ideal for running when you don't need the advanced functions like GPS or heart rate."
2,Paradigm shift,"Barker's book is informative but his stilted and halting style of writing is difficult to stick with. There were points when I thought, ""Is this just a commercial for Barker's supposed genius?"". There seemed to be alot of self-promotion. But again, the information was good. I found myself looking at the world around me a little differently, looking for the paradigms in my world and thinking about ways to solve old, unsolvable problems."
4,Good for 3-D beginners,"Being proficient at Photoshop and Illustrator for 4 years soon wasn't enough. I found the need to break into 3-D modeling. My first attempt was to teach myself 3D Studio Max. I know, I know: Good luck, buddy. I gave up. But by advice I purchased Amorphium Pro. It is great for beginners. Don't be fooled because you still have to practice at it and work your rear off to get better. But Amorphium is the best step for 3-D beginners. It is like modeling electronic clay. My best software purchase ever!"
1,Don't Bother,"I didn't like the holster I got from Verizon with my new RAZR - so I thought I'd try this one. The first day I had it, the phone fell out of the holster in the driveway in the rain. If you value your new RAZR, don't trust this product to hold it securely."
1,Your Razr is in danger,My Razr does not stay mounted to this holster. I have dropped the phone several times and will not use this product again.
1,Unable to use this product,the Motorola Razr phone keeps falling off this clip. I am unable to use it with the Motorola Razr.
2,flimsy,"Cheap plastic and cheap construction. Waist clip broke off its metal spring pin within two weeks. Not worth the money. But its design of keeping the glass face towards wearer, thereby protecting it, rather than facing out where it will be more easily scratched, is a good one."
1,Ratcheting Swivel Belt Holster for Motorola RAZR V3,Does not work well. Phone won't stay in holster.
1,Mount doesn't fit Motorola RAZR V3.,Mount doesn't fit Motorola RAZR V3. Appreciated Amazon no hassle return.
2,Weak,"The holster seemed great at first, but within about 1/2 hour of getting it, I sat in a chair with armrests and snagged the holster on an armrest, breaking the clip from the holster. I've had other similar holsters that have held up to much more abuse than this without problems. For the price, I can't complain, but it is a very weak design."
2,belt holster for mot razr,Initially worked fine. Cheap plastic spring loaded clip portion brokke after 1 month of gentle use. Wouldn't buy again.
5,Good clip,I have had this clip for about a month now. I really like it and it was very inexpensive. I would consider it a good clip for the razr phone.
1,Buy something else,"Two problems with this holster.As mentioned previously, it doesn't look like the item pictured. The new design was in fact so secure that it often took two hands to get the phone out. Not exactly easy to use, but the phone was secure until...After less than one month of use I got into a car only to have the holster hit the seat belt connector, which caused it to shear off from the belt clip. Cheap plastic holds the holster and belt clip together.I don't have a better holster yet, but this one is poorly designed and cheaply made."
2,NOT LIKE PICTURE,"I ordered this about nine months ago and was a good belt clip, it just broke like most do with time. I re-ordered this and they sent me not the same belt clip as pictured. Extreemly hard to get phone in and out. Would rate this belt clip 1 star and the older one 5 stars."
1,Buyer Beware,"I have ordered this item 3 times from Amazon. The first time, it was exactly as pictured and worked perfectly. The second and third time it was a different clip. The clip was for a RAZR, but was a different style. The one I recieve has several design flaws. One being the fact that the phone clips in with the small screen facing outwards. This exposes it to scratches.The second flaw is that it does not hold the phone very tightly. The phone seams to never correctly clip in. The third one I purchased was for a friend. His phone fell out and broke in half the second day he had the new clip.I would have rated this item zero stars had it let me. Do not buy this clip unless you have free phone replacement."
3,Mixed feelings,"The holster is very sleek and low profile and the phone is relatively secure when it's in place. However, I sat down in my car seat and the holster broke off between the clothes clip and the part that holds the phone. I like it, but it broke within the first two days I had it."
4,Very good basic RAZR Holder,"This clip holder works very well under most conditions. I've never had any problems described by other reviewers, and have been using this now for about 6 months.Very simple to put the phone into the holder, and there is a nice ""click"" feel to let you know its secure. To remove, simply depress the top part and pull up... phone comes right out into your hand. I've never had it come loose on its own, unless I didn't place it properly.It does ride a little bit high on the belt, but I've not really found that to be a problem.Overall, very satisfied with this holder."
3,Not bad for $10,"I had a hard time finding a decent holster for the RAZR and this unit ""fit the bill"". After quite a bit of use, I've found the following:1) The unit tends to swivel quite a bit without the wearer trying to move it.2) It protrudes quite a bit above a belt and can get quite uncomfortable on plane rides. It's not bad in a car. I usually take it off for plane trips.3) The fact that it keeps the face safe by facing inwards is a great feature.4) The RAZR can be difficult to remove from the holster until you get the hang of it.Overall, I like the unit. Most of the time, I just keep the RAZR in my pocket, but if I'm wearing tighter pants, it's handy to have the clip so it doesn't show through."
3,Didn't Thrill Me,"Sorry, but I find this alt country/pop superband a little dull. Nothing on Vermilion is bad, but neither is it particularly distinctive. The songs describe frayed or broken relationships and hardworking people who -- surprise, surprise -- don't get rewarded for their effort. In other words, these are well-worked and familiar themes, but no Drifter brings new insights to these old ideas. The work lacks cohesion, no single voice, no single vision. It's not even an ensemble effort that works in the way the best Robert Altman movies work, with individual talents melded into a group identity. Instead, with Vermilion and the CD's first CD -- which I like somewhat better -- you get six distinct talents, supporting each other's songs with harmonies and instrumentation. Very nice and very forgettable."
4,Go Driften!,"I'm going to keep this short and sweet--I LOVE this cd because of the raw energy. It is barely produced-it sounds like they just plugged in, picked up the microphone, turned it up to 10, and hit record, in someone's basement! Great songs, rough, ragged playing, voices that seem to appear out of nowhere, it feels like you're in the room with them. Long live Americana, long live the Continental Drifters. Highly recommended!"
5,Classy rock/folk,"Vermillion is an interesting progression over the Continental Drifters' first CD which is now out of print. The band has broadened it's musical stretch with the addition of Vicky Peterson. I miss the couple of covers from the first album like Michael Nesmith's ""Some of Shelly's Blues,"" but the band-penned material is all solid. Where the first album would have more emphasis on folk, I labeled this a ""rock/folk"" album because they do rock out with just enough acoustic touches to keep their musical integrity and rise above the mainstream. I highly recommend this CD!"
2,Title is misleading,"The subtitle of the book is how to understand, study and apply God's word. The book really doesn't do that. It is mostly about the Bible, in general, and why Christians should trust it to be the word of God. I was hoping for something to use with new believers to help them study the Bible for themselves and this book isn't very useful for that."
4,Can't Go Wrong Ordering Books,This company has always been dependable and I have receied every book in an orderly fashion! I'm sold on this company to send my school books to me quikly! Thanks
2,the only book i never finished,"I was honestly was completely able to get past the continuous times that MacArthur plugs his own Bible in this book. The first time it annoyed me, and I thought I could make it through after three or four, but after awhile I just couldn't do it anymore. Shameless self-publicity for me ruined a decent book otherwise.The title is also very misleading, since the book deals little with the effects of Biblical study or methods of study. Instead, expect more of a textbook writing style with information on what the Bible is and different views of its prominence and readings."
5,Great compilation of short poems,"I'm not really into poetry but found this author from an episode of Anthony Bourdain's show and really enjoyed the compilation. That said, I enjoyed the book and am happy with my purchase."
2,two in a row fell apart,"When the first one fell apart, they replaced it quickly and kindly, thus more than one star. The second one fell apart within a week. I'm not trying for a third."
1,RFI is a major problem,"I live near a radio tower and when I first got this pre-amp things were hunky corey, on a sunny day you could hear a feint radio signal between songs, now that the device is 1 year old the signal comes through clear as day while I am listening to my record player. I would invest in a more expensive unit if you live in a city or at all near a radio transmitter."
5,versatile,"The Rolls VP29 hooked up easily and works great. The fact that it has RCA as well as headphone jack outputs is a great feature, and RIAA curve adjustment for optimal sound quality coming from your record player. I also liked that it has a screw for my record player to be grounded to - a feature that not all preamps I've looked at had.All together a failry good looking (in a techie way), compact design that most importantly sounds great.*update* hooked up the VP29 directly to my line-in jack on my laptop (MacBook Pro) and got a clean, full digital copy of my vinyl - beautiful. Great buy so far."
4,Rolls VP29 Phono Preamplifier,Several years ago I purchased a new receiver which rendered my turn table useless. After years of not being able to enjoy my vinyl I purchased the Rolls VP29 Preamp. I have been very happy with the results with only one exception. The preamp does not have an on/off switch and since I dont use the preamp very often I am left with the only option of removing the jack for the power connection. I had to locate the preamp behind the turn table so I could perform this operation each time. Small price to pay to hear my old collection. Overall I am very happy with the product.
4,Great Ideas... Bad Proportions,"I love this book for the meals it has inspired. With a few exceptions, the proportions are pretty strange in this book. Everything must be tasted and tested for consistency, texture, and flavor.The photos are gorgeous, and with some tweaking all of the recipes I've tried have been absolutely mind-blowing!"
5,Bobby Flay is ON FIRE!,"This man ROCKS. I LOVE his cooking and this cookbook brings all of his talent to the ""people."" He's so creative and full of energy. His appeal is wide and now with this cookbook, everyone can appreciate and try his great receipes. It's a great alternative to getting to NY and checking out Mesa Grill or Bolo. That's a REAL treat. Bobby Flay is one of the best! ...and, he's so darn cute too. :)"
2,Haven't been thrilled with the recipes,"We have tried many recipes from this book, and haven't been pleased with any of them. They turn out OK, but I expected more complex flavors and better textures from Bobby Flay recipes. I know people who have eaten at his restaurant in New York and were very impressed, so obviously he isn't publishing his best recipes. I wouldn't buy another of his cookbooks."
1,Watch his television show instead,"Catch Bobby's show for a month, visit his web site and print a few recipes and you'll have this book already. No need to purchase, nothing new or exciting in here just a few of his vinagrettes, sauces and spiced up main courses. This book was a waste of my money. I had hoped he'd discuss technique and not just cram the book full of recipes I'd already seen him create on the show."
1,They skiped way to much.,"I was so happy they put this novela on dvd . But to my disappointment they cut way to much out and it hardly even showed the main characters .They cut out lots of good parts like when julieta has an eating disorder , when el terco dies from a drug overdose and how Jackie's dad dies at the end......also it only showed (Kuno Becker) Ruben like 3 times it didn't even introduce him he just kinda showed up in a scene. I was so sad cuz he was my favorite, And they practically cut him out :/Don't waist your money."
3,My mistake !,Did not know what Kalamata olives were. These olives werepacked in nice plastic tubs and easy to use. The only timeI had black olives were from a deli and they were in olive oil.The taste was not at all the same.
3,NOT A PARTY PACK,Please know this is NOT A PARTY PACK! I ordered it thinking I would get twelve bubbling glitter bugs. I got ONE. they are cute but the name of product is FALSE ADVERTISING!!!
4,great,"I don't listen to this very often, unless I'm working on a project or reading a book. The music is very good, but some of the tracks are very short. I do love the music, and would recommend."
1,Made in CHINA,"I bought this product thinking I was buying quality goods made in the USA. When I received the package, I was disheartened to see Made in China/Fecha en Chino printed on the side. I am a firm believer in supporting your own country. Buying USA made products may cost about the same or a little bit more, but by buying products made in this country, we are supporting our economy and helping to keep jobs in this country. Item returned."
2,Not Impressed,"Perhaps I was expecting too much from this product for the price. However, the drawers did not slide smoothly and the aluminum trim piece was missing from the middle drawer. I therefore returned this item to Amazon."
1,Worst of the worst,"Dr.Zukow advocates things that are *dangerous* for children. The entire book boils down to putting yourself above your child at all costs......basically, emotional abuse.This was yet another waste of time. I wouldn't recomend this book to my worst enemy."
2,Not very useful book.,"That's not very great book. There is some useful graphs in it, but you can find those in any semiconductor related book. The rest is useless."
3,Great coffee table book,"Great cover photo, very limited information on modern aviation, discusses begaining of jet age along with other aviation history. Mostly subjects on history of flight and the quest for speed."
4,Good,"Very good photographs, and a fair though slightly incomplete history of the jet age. Could use some updating on modern technology, but otherwise OK."
2,"Not bad, but not great","The cups measure about 2.75, 3.25, and 3.75 inches in diameter. The colors are similar to the picture, but mixed up. (My cups/lids are: lrg-pink/teal, med-green/yellow, sml-orange/yellow.) I like the look and sizes, but...The medium and large flip tops snap in three places, so you have to push a couple times to get them closed flat. Also, I'm afraid the ""hinge"" will crack before long, since it's white after one use.The small lid doesn't seem tight enough to stay on if it was rubbing against things in a diaper bag.These are fun, but you're probably better of using regular Tupperware or Take n Toss type containers."
1,lids did not close,"One of the few things I have returned. Cheap, both in price and quality. Lids did not close on two of the containers."
3,Perfect sized snack cups,"I bought these to send snacks to school for my son, they are a bit 'young' looking but they were all I could find BPA Free - which is very important to me. The smaller one also does not seal well/ lid stays on, otherwise I am pleased with them"
2,Too small,"The cups are very small, they look big in the picture but the aren't. it is ok for dry snack like cherios but still you can't really add too much.I wish they were bigger and it will be fine because the plastic is actually very nice and heavy duty."
1,Ha haha..,"I got my much wanted copy of Hymns from the Vedas and Upanishads, Vedic Chants and the CD was missing! I didn't bother to reorder."
2,Not for the Average Amkerican,"I found this recording bording, repetitive, and wit no musical merit. I'm an average American with Scandinavian ancety, and I enjoy some Asian chanting ecording, but this is a recording bound to appeal to Asians, and few others."
3,Not what I expected!,"I've never felt the need to write a review of a CD before, but received this CD and was so excited to hear another CD by this beautiful singer. Put it into my CD player, and it's exactly the same songs as the French CD, only in Spanish! Definitely not what I was expecting, and I'm not very impressed. Why listen to all of the same songs over again, after paying for a whole new CD? If you own the ""A Tatons"" CD, definitely don't invest in this one. A big waste of money. Who does two CDs that are exactly the same only in a different language???"
1,Not for fans of the music in the movie ...,"Sure, maybe some of the songs in this collection were tacked on in edited forms into the closing credits, but the majority of the music in the film is not here. Great tracks by Rachid Taha (off his Made in Medina album) figure prominently through out and aren't here. Jasmine Tabatabai not only contributes a memorable song to the film, but can be seen performing it live in an early club scene. Also not on the cd.If you like the darker, richer, exotic music of the film, pick up albums by Taha and Tabatabai.If you like mediocre compilations of absolutely horrifying covers of once great songs (I actually got physically ill hearing the versions of Venus in Furs and Killing Moon) then maybe pick this up.The one or two decent tracks (ok, one) like Collide's just aren't worth the buy in.The art of soundtracking and film scoring has reached an all time low here."
2,Missing Cash Machine!,"First off, I loved this movie! I am one of the very few who did. I loved the music in the movie as well, but this CD is missing my favorite songs from the movie: Hard-Fi's Cash Machine. The song played as Vivian took Aiden up to the roof of the private property. Some of the music clips also sounded like bits from that one Mandy Moore song. Anyway, weak CD! Good movie. I am reading the book now!"
3,It was alright for its time.,"I bought it for 2 of the songs.""A child of God"" was a disappointment. based on her singing persona, I was expecting it to be extra raunchy. I suppose it was considered scandalous for the 70's."
2,There are different versions of this product,"There are at least two different versions of this CD. I ordered the one shown in the song list on the CD page. That version is different from the picture shown above the list of songs. Song #3 on the song list is Don't count the rainy days. The picture shows a different song. There is also another version of the same CD on this site. Make sure you order the one you want ! The song I got the CD for, is not included."
4,Super comfy everyday wear thats still cute,"I really like these, they're very comfy cotton/modal feel, they sit very low on the hip, and they have full back coverage(a definite plus). I'm definity going to by more colors to wear, although I did find they ran abit on the small side, albeit they're very stretchy."
5,Holding On to Karen Scott's Album,"Karen Scott transcends her love of our Lord with the talent and gift of music. She shares her heartfelt and beautifully written lyrics with the world in hopes to inspire others to believe and remain faithful to God, Our Holy Father. In spite of the dysfunctional world events, Karen Scott's music flows with the triumph of hope, love, and trust through the messages of Christ, Our Savior. I highly recommend this album to any music lover!"
2,Bugs Galore...too bad we need it.,"If you want to LARP with Garou and other shapeshifters, this is a necessary supplement. Unfortunately, it is full of errors and internal contradictions as well as some _extremely_ bad mechanics. With moderate effort this can be cleaned up into a respectable and usable book, but it really needed to have been playtested and edited a lot better."
2,No longer required...,"Thankfully, the much better thought-out and edited Laws of the Wild Revised has come out. Don't bother with this edition."
4,great!,"this book is great all around. for being small it is not only a great reference, but also a a great guide for beginers. a must have for begining MET or LARP players."
1,This book is terrible!!!,"This book is awful!!! Don't buy it!!! It has no strategies in it and it doesn't help!!! I was just crying out of frustration because it wasn't explaining anything right so you don't know how to do any of the questions!!! This book is just god awful, don't use it!!!"
5,Terrific,Boot Camp for Your Brain is a great book if one wants to improve his SAT score. The book gives almost all the information one will ever need to do well on the SAT. All the person has to do is follow the directions and soon ones SAT score will go up. My score personally went up over 300 points.
5,jake bartlam,this book was very beneficial for helping me with my SAT score. It goes over everything you will encounter in your SAT.
5,Great Resource for improving SAT scores,"My HS daughter used this book along with the World's Best Prep course and improved her SAT score 250 points. Well worth it!Boot Camp for Your Brain: A No-Nonsense Guide to the SAT I, Second Edition"
5,Boot Camp for Your Brain,My son had great success with this book - it is a no-nonsense approach to SAT prep. It's easy to read and a great resource. I highly recommend this book!
4,Large Verbal and Math Improvement Thanks to Boot Camp!,"After reading Boot Camp for Your Brain and taking the World's Best SAT Prep class, my SAT score improved over 200 points! I found the vocabulary lists and math facts the most helpful; by studying a portion of each section every day and taking my own notes to emphasize the lessons, I quickly increased my scores on both sections of the SAT. I enthusiastically recommend this book and the prep course to any student who is serious about improving their scores."
2,Boot Camp for Your Brain: A No-Nonsence Guide to the SAT 1,"I have helped kids improve their SAT test scores for seven years. I buy lots of books just to get different perspectives, but I have never written a review. Mostly because I think lots of books offer good information. I am writing this one simply because I was so disappointed in this book. Based on the reviews this book received I was really looking forward to reading it (maybe my expectatations were too high??). However, when I started reading it I felt the format was hard to follow and think many kids would lose interest fast. It's not that the information isn't good-If a student is already well above the 1000 point mark perhaps he/she could follow the format and not lose interest. If a student is not well above the 1000 point level, I believe the format will be difficult to follow. I will say that I think the vocab lists are good, if a student has ample time to prepare-"
5,Great preperation for the SAT,"This book is very helpful for those who want to raise their SAT scores significantly. It helps the student to focus in on what is the most important thing to study, so hours aren't wasted studying useless information."
5,Best SAT Prep EVER!,"I started reading this book only about a month before the SATs, but it was sooo great!! I found the format to be so easy to use ... It read like a novel yet I was learning tricks and new words. The word list in the back is full of words that I saw on my real SAT and if I hadn't learned them from this book, I would have been lost. The math practice problems were great even better because they helped reiterate important math concepts that I needed for the test. I met my goal, 1450, thanks to Boot Camp. My score went up 140 points!! My math score went from a 700 to a perfect 800!! My verbal score went from a 610 to a 650! Because of this book, I am no longer worried about getting into college."
5,EXCELLENT BOOK FOR SAT,This book helped my daughter increase her score by 340 points. The book is written in a way that makes you want to read it and is very helpful in preparing for the SAT examinations. I would highly recommend it to any one who is preparing to sit the SAT.
5,Great Book/Program,What a great book! Goes in total depth of the SAT and will not leave anything that will be on the SAT. If you are in the Washingtion DC area highly encouraged to attend that program.
5,"Student of Prep class, used Bootcamp book",This book is great for independent study. There is a lot of information to help improve math and writing scores. Includes a section of helpful math hints and practice problems and memory devices to learn a large list of vocabulary words. Will help improve critical reading and math scores significantly. Also includes helpful before and after the test advice.
5,fantastic movie,this movie is well acted and i would recommend that those of you who have not seen it .please go ahead and watch it
4,Wonderful film,"I had missed this film on the BBC at Christmas time and ordered it online. Really inspiring film and esepcially so, as it is based on a true story.Well worth purchasing."
5,What a Great Story.,"Do not be frightened by the French title and the promise of subtitles. The story revolves around Scottish, German, and French soldiers, so there are going to be subtitles for the French and German dialogue. But this movie is well worth the ""hassle"" of reading. **I do not feel it's a hassle, but I work in TV rental and that's what I'm told when I suggest foreign films.**The main actors give brilliant performances. Guillaume Canet is terrific as the French leader. He does a good job portraying his character as conflicted; torn between his duty as an officer, and his duty as a human being. Daniel Bruhl leads the German side as a compassionate man who tries to be a tough officer. The Scottish are...well...the Scottish. The acting is terrific, and the cinematography captures the essence of being a WWI soldier in the trenches. If you pass on this movie, you will be doing yourself a great injustice."
5,A Cinematic Masterpiece,"I just finished watching this movie and I am still blown away by its powerful message. Joyeux Noel is an excellent movie on just about every level...visually stunning, musically interesting, emotionally stirring, and rife with characters that one won't easily forget. I had heard about this episode in history before, and Garth Brooks sings a song about it, but to see it come to life, however fictionalized it may be, made for an amazing theatrical experience. I just happened upon this movie by random while shopping the clearance section of a Blockbuster Video store. I am so glad I decided to make the purchase. I can't wait to share it with others. One of the greatest Christmas movies I've ever seen."
5,Once again good is punished!,"This was a heartwarming movie for a while unfortunately the realistic ending reminded me that ""no good deed goes unpunished."
5,THE Anti War Movie,"""Joyeaux Noel"" by Christian Carion deals with the spontaneous Christmas""truce""between enemies in the trenches of World War I. Beautifully filmed, cast, and acted, I think it is the most moving and effective anti war film, I have ever seen. Frankly, I think it beats films such as ""Full Metal Jacket"" or ""Platoon"" (or even ""Saving Private Ryan"")by a long shot, particularly the first two since the Great War was just about as pointless as was Viet Nam. This was a very poignant time to have released such a film. I've bought several copies for gifts for next Christmas."
4,Great,"I seen it and it is not quite what I expected. I saw the middle part when they play the bigpipes and stuff I it was very impressive. Then when I brought the whole movie, the whole thing is a little long and repetitive to me. Still it is a great movie with a whole new idea (I had seen only a few WWI movies before), and in certain scenes it had been spectacular. It certainly worth the money to buy it considering you have great storyline and some nice music to listen to from time to time."
4,Joyous Meeting,"If you enjoy movies like ""The Lost Battalion"" and ""A Midnight Clear"" be sure to catch this one. This is not the first time nor is it likely to be the last of the telling of a ceasefire at Christmas during WWI. Most have heard of a movie or two showing soldiers playing soccer and exchanging gifts in 1914 on the battleground in Belgium. This movie does a nice job of showing the French, Scots, and Germans in a truce on Christmas Eve after hearing a Scottish Clergyman play the bagpipes and a German Tenor sing. All the back stories of the soldiers is fascinating and certainly well researched as to the conditions during that war. The level of detail is excellent and therefore makes this movie well worth seeing. I recommend it for all but the very young. Afterall war means some will die, and it may be by friendly fire. The dvd is good quality."
1,The CD was broken,The CD was broken.2. Reduced to fragments; fragmented.3. ruptured; torn; fractured.4. not functioning properly; out of working order.
4,A pretty decent film,The film is pretty amusing due to the characters and their interactions with one another. I did enjoy it although it wasn't necessarily as life-changing as some people told me it was. All in all: not bad.
4,Well Done,"Joyeux Noel is a well told story for the ages. If people can stop fighting for a day, they can do it for a life-time. Thank you."
5,Joyeux Noel - a terrific Christmas classic!,Joyeux Noel is a very touching movie - one that should become a Christmas classic! I bought several copies to give to friends and family.
1,No subtitles with Amazon Unbox.,"Great movie, poor service.Joyeux Noel is an amazing movie, and I loved it the first time I saw it. Unfortunately, Amazon Unbox offers absolutely no subtitle options. Seeing as this movie is pretty much a 30% mix of German, French, and English, if you're not fluent with each, you are missing out on a great deal of this movie. Don't buy the digital copy on Amazon."
4,Joyeux Noel (Widescreen)Joyeux Noel (Widescreen),Got this to watch at Christmas. Will wait until next year to watch it. This looked like it might be very entertaining and a little different that the run of the mill offerings.
5,exellent,the first time i watched it tears welled when they started to sing and play the bag pipe. an all around feel good christmas movie' different than all the others
3,Entertaining but unrealistic,"Film was entertaining but unrealistic. The director said in the interview the examples of soldiers communicating with the enemy were much more subtle. Even my French wife who lost her great-grand-father in this war thought the film was a little too ""syrupy"". Its obvious the director is a idealistic pacifist who does not like organized religion (noticed in the portrayal of the Bishop)."
2,Good history destroyed by bad representation,"This movie had potential. However, it took a great story and then played loose and free with the facts. If they had stuck with the actual events, the film would have been just as interesting as any fictitious stories invented by the producers. O.k., that addresses the plot and story....... The technical advisor really screwed up with the uniforms. Every German general is shown with an open collar. Wrong, wrong, wrong. All German tunics in this period buttoned to the neck --- period! They never wore open tunic collars. You cannot find a photo of an open collar on a general who was properly dressed. Not only does it look sloppy, it is factually incorrect. A simple check with a competent military historical advisor would have solved this error. Bottom Line: This film is slightly entertaining but could have been an excellent film with a little more effort."
2,Bland,Good Things: Well made. Well acted. Professional work. Properly funded.Bad Things: The film is propaganda for the Left. The main message can be boiled down to this: Man is good. Government is bad. The Christian Church is evil. Also there is an unecessary sex scene in the film - which is why it should have kept an R rating. If you are thinking of showing this film to young people as an example of what took place in 1914 then you should look for something else. This film is simply revisionist history - well made propaganda.
1,Dissappointing.,"Maybe about 10 minutes is about all we could stomache of this one. I had hoped we were getting a good Christmas movie. The unnecessarily foul content in just the opening took out the desire to find out how good it might have been...and the kids weren't even in the room!There's a lot of great family/Christian Christmas movies out there like ""Truce in the Forest"", ""House without a Christmas Tree"", ""It's a Wonderful Life"", ""Bishops Wife"", ""The Christmas Box"", ""Christmas Eve"", ""Midnight Clear"", ""A Christmas Visitor"" etc...so people don't have to waste their time & money on trash like this."
5,"""The Blessings of Friendship"" IS a Blessing!",We are using this book in our ladies Bible study and have loved it! It's very relational in subject matter and the women are drawn out to share their experiences being a friend and how their friends have related to them. It covers all the bases as far as being the kind of friend you would want someone to be to you:-)...I highly recommend this study...
4,Almost perfect for a princess,"I recently bought this set for my daughter's new room. I love the concept, but the fabric looks almost faded. Either way it is perfect for my princess's room. It looks great with the other colors in the room, but I would have liked it to be a bit darker, or at least had a better quality print."
5,Woo Hoo!,What can I say? It's Dark Shadows! The themes I loved and interviews from old radio programs. Makes me smile just thinking of it!!!
3,The Original Music From Dark Shadows (Television Series Soundtrack - Deluxe Edition),"The music just cracked me up (and I liked enough as part of TV History to buy it) - but frankly, I watched maybe two episodes of the series as it aired here (Los Angeles) on weekday afternoons (3:30pm). But I had Junior High School classmates that lived by the show...P.S., The Los Angeles Times also ran the Dark Shadows Comic Strip in the Late 70's (anyone remember?)"

5,My favorite kitchen appliance!!,"I have had this rice cooker for a few years now. I love it more than I can say. My grandma has always used Zojirushi and I have come to love it too. She has had only a few because they usually last her over a decade and she uses it every other day. This rice cooker is amazing. It has cooked rice perfectly every time. I love the brown rice setting for the times I cook brown rice. It has a timer so I can set my rice before I leave for work to be cooked at 5 when I get home. It even sings a cute little tune when it starts and stops. I know the battery will be a little difficult to have replaced when it dies but so far, in five years, I haven't had to replace it. However, this was something I was aware of when I got this cooker. The product is a little pricey but completely worth it!"
2,can not replace battery,"We've had this for about five years. The battery went dead but THERE IS NO WAY TO CHANGE THE BATTERY. The battery is soldered to the circuit board! They expect you to ship it back to the factory which will probably cost $20 each way! I opened it up, cut out the old battery, and duct-taped a new battery in there but it just comes loose every few months. Cooks rice great, though."
5,I love my Zoji!,"I grew up in an Asian family and my parents always had a one-button rice cooker. So when I saw this one, I said to myself ""what's the big deal, a rice cooker's a rice cooker, right?"" Wrong! This rice cooker makes rice 10 times better, if I could put a numerical value to it, than any of the one-button cookers we have used. Now rice has become one of my husband's favorite things to have for dinner. Considering that he's white and wasn't brought up on rice, it says a lot. : )Tips on making Cantonese style porridge: cook the porridge as instructed with water / stock. When the porridge is done, add boiling hot water / stock to bring it to the desired consistency. It's important to add the liquid as the last step. If you add extra liquid at the beginning, the porridge will not cook properly. I've tried it."
5,Perfect!,I finally purchased this rice cooker recently and love it! I have made white rice and brown rice and it comes out perfect every time. It is easy to use and clean. If you eat a lot of rice I think it is worth it to invest in a good quality Zojirushi cooker.
4,Nice rice cooker,Decided to get a rice cooker that I can leave on for more than a day and still have warm rice to eat. This one works well. The only thing I wish it had was an on and off switch instead of having to unplug it to turn it off.
2,Beware the condition of your purchase,"I have the same rice cooker (except with induction heating) and wanted to purchase this item as a wedding gift. Well, when I get this item, I notice the box seems a little less than new. I notice that the rice measuring cup is missing, the manual is worn and there is the scent of rice in the machine. IT WAS A USED ITEM. Note that the item is not sealed but Amazon should have known. Very disappointed, especially for an item this expensive."
5,Just works,I think we have the same one but the Japanese model. ZH-LS18. Description (neuro fuzzy/10 cup) is the same and it looks exactly the same except that the writing is all Japanese. We got it when we were in Japan in 2003 visiting my wifes's family. We've had it for about 6 1/2 years and it just keeps on ticking. It makes the best rice I have ever had and can be used for more than just plain rice. The feature I personally like best is that you can leave it in warming mode for many hours and the rice stays nice and moist and warm and does not dry out.
2,disappointed,"I've had one Zojirushi NS-LAC05 Micom 3-Cup Rice Cooker and Warmer and I love it. This one, I don't know why but it just cannot meet my expectation set by the Micom cooker which is now too small for my family. I believe a $20 cooker cooks better. Have to return it."
4,Good Rice Cooker- Hard to return,"I need to return the product it stop working properly, but it seems not as easy to return the item since I got it from 3rd party seller on Amazon, I am waiting to see how easily it will be & how long it will take, will update the status once I find out more."
5,Love Love Love,"I always buy ""Made in Japan"" products when it comes to rice cooker, and I was never let down. They make delicious and moist rice all the time. Melody is really cute and helpful, and to be able to set the timer is great for busy moms like myself."
3,way over priced,"I have used the $200 NS-JCC18 (got it barely used on craigslist for $20) which is the same model as this without the drip pan on the top. I have also used theAroma 3 Quart or 4-20 Cups Rice Cooker & Food Steamer with Sensor Logic Technology - Recipe Book Includedwhich every warehouse member store now sells for $30. both machines are non-induction and non-presurized, and both use fuzzy logic to maintain proper temperature for the proper duration, so why anyone would overpay for these Japanese brands that offer little in the way of additional features is beyond my comprehension. The Aroma even comes with a vegetable steam tray, while Zojirushi forbids you from cooking anything in here but rice and oats. If you gotta have this kind of status symbol, at least get one that also bakes bread likeSanyo ECJ-S35K 3-1/2-Cup Micro-Computerized Rice Cooker/Warmer with Bread-Baking Function, Black"
1,neuro fuzzy rice cooker,"I'm very disappointed with this product. I had one that lasted 6 yrs. then it didn't work anymore so I bought a brand new one with same model. I only cooked it twice. The first time, it can keep the rice up to 3 days. The 2nd time, the rice got spoiled after 12 hrs. I will not buy this model again. Very disappointed!!!"
3,Didn't last as long as I hoped it would,Bought this in 2010 and it worked great... for a while. About two years later it started acting funny. The heat was fickle and the rice would get too soggy if it was in the cooker for more than a few hours. Finally gave up on it and bought a new rice cooker.
2,"Big Sould Calibur fan, here.","I was ecstatic to receive my copy of this game. I played the first one on Dreamcast and then the second on the Xbox and was excited for this one when i saw it for sale. The game is a pitiful reminder of the glory that was Soul Calibur 2. This and the Fifth are the only games in this franchise I didn't like. As for the shipper, everything was fine. I received it in a timely manner and there were no deffects to speak of."
5,Good Game,IT's an interesting game. I love it.The only problem is that I'm quite busy and I don't have time to play it everyday.
2,It was good while it lasted.,"When I got home I poped in this game and I played and played and played,and I had fun. This Is a good game the graphics are amazing and the gameplay is very solid. But sadly it only lasted for about 5 days, then when I wanted to show this game to my friends it had an error with loading. Overall this game is Great but did not last very long."
1,Don't Waste Your Time/Money,"I was pumped when I bought this game at the store, but as soon as I popped it in, I was seriously disappointed. After playing a few matches with most of the characters, a friend and I started playing Soul Cal 2 again for XBox. The graphics are worse, the sounds/speech is worse, the movements are slower...I could go on forever, baby. I really want to know what Namco was thinking when they were making this. We were joking, but being serious, that if we had been told this game was for PSOne, we would believe them. Any advanced Soul Cal player should say that this game blows. If they had taken Soul Cal 2, and used the new characters, made a new Weapon Master, and used the new outfits, then I would actually be pleased with spending $50 on this game. Everyone, do yourself a favor and don't buy this game, and if you don't have Soul Calibur 2, get that instead."
1,soul calibur 3,The game never played correctly. I e mailed the company in california twice and no response. If they say they did respond they are lieing. I will never by from a second hand shop again. Disappointed.Soul Calibur 3
5,Awesome!,It's the greatest fighting game. There are lots os playing modes and the custom characters are really cool.
2,Huge disappointment,"Soul Calibur, and its sequel were two of the best fighting games to come out this generation, but they took a leap backwards releasing the 3rd.Making a game that was pick up and play, then turning it into something that you have to memorize every move, and every counter move was a mistake.I tried many times to give this a chance but after a week of just being angry when i play it, I figured I'd get rid of it.Beautiful graphically, but everything else is a thumbs down for me."
3,fun,"this game was fun, though it was not the same as other soulcalibur games. This one has a more of an rpg element to it and is not as fun as other games in this series."
1,Feels like a 6 year old game !!!,"I would agree with anybody that the 1999 Soul Calibur on Dreamcast was a Masterpiece. I really loved that game. But that was 6 years ago!There is nothing new about Soul Cabibur 3. It's just the same old stuff that you had already played for hundreds of hours years ago.There are a few new moves and combos, but the new moves just turn the game into a ""Button Masher"". Which means you can easily beat the game by rapidly mashing the attack button. The previous games made you think a little about your strategy, but now there is NO strategy or real skill involved.Plus it's on Playstation, so you know what type of graphics your getting (the worst graphics out of the 3 systems)."
4,"Overall, a very fun game","This game is great. It is a bit difficult to master and discover all of the attacks, but the characters are cool, and the game even alows you to design your own custom fighter, not to mention there are a couple of diffrent modes to play in. Overall, a very fun game."
1,"Spend a little more, you'll be happy you did!","Spend a little more, you'll be happy you did! My wife ordered this MP3 for my 13 year old son and he was quite excited to get it... after waiting a week to get it, we opened the box and while the unit itself is sleek and looks fine, the instruction manual was so small we actually needed a magnifying glass to read some of it.. and it made NO SENSE! This was the worst instruction manual I have ever seen.. we could not figure out how to use this thing at all! It is not plug and play for Windows XP like it claims.. my computer just kept telling me it could read the new hardware and when I decided to download the Windows 98 driver they provided just to try it, I got an error that stated ""No find MP3 Player""... even the error message was in broken English! After 2 very frustrating hours with this thing, we put in it back in the box, printed out a return label and returned it."
3,You get what you pay for,"In general, I agree with the other review (1-star). I give it 3 stars only because of the very low price and I guess low expectations. The fact that I did manage to get the mp3 onto the unit and can play them satisfied my simple needs. I had no interest in the FM. The user guide that is provided is laughable -- it's as if someone was playing a cruel joke with the English language. K-byte does have a support site, but doesn't mention this unit -- it may be too new? Anyway it's at www.kbytememory.com"
1,Not worth what you paid!,"I can see why my ""friend"" sold it so cheap - the manual is horribly written in terrible English. For example ""Live:Below the function elucidation divides the A type is two kinds of with the type of B, if inconvenient understand please."" Make sense to you? It goes down hill from there! I happen to have Windows 98 and thought ""great! it will work with my old system"" NOT!! Anyone know where I can get the Windows 98 driver for this before I throw it in a box and toss it in a corner for a life lesson?If you are thinking of getting it, save your money - or better yet, buy mine!"
1,Not a good product,"Poorly written user manual, unable to download songs. Definitely would not buy this unit."
4,Pure Classics,"This is the type of compilation albulm that has to be in your collection. Here is why.1.) You got classics that are now hard enough to find, let alone on seperate cd's.2.) When is the last time a cd came with a booklet that was just as interesting. This is great for understanding where hip hop/r&b; came from (as far Def Jam) and where most music is at today.3.) No cd of the four outshines another one. With such good songs and so many of them, it's hard to decide which cd you want to play.They should think about doing for 1995 to 2005. They have a wider selection of artist to choose from. Though they all may not be classics like these, they are guaranteed to please the hip-hop/r&b; lover in all of us."
3,A mish mash of rap,"Wow. For 60$ this is one big, hit or miss collection. For every `Rebel Without A Pause' there's a `I Need Love'. For every `Jack the Ripper' there's a 'The Rain'. With the same money you could get the original `Bum rush the Show' `Nations of Millions' `Strictly Business' `Bigger and Deffer' `Cactus Album' and `Pauls Boutique' CDs. Look elsewhere for your Hip Hop hits."
4,Clever these French,Cuisinart offers an astonishingly well designed and engineered product. The company is equally clever at redesigning everything in a way that forces customers to buy a whole new unit rather than just replace worn parts.
5,Just right,The bowl was as described and fit perfect and priced good too. Now I know where to buy when I break something else.
1,Defective,"It wouldn't fit right with the cover, it was hard to remove the cover from it, and the white post (with the spring by the handle) wouldn't budge when the cover tried to push it down. Had to return it; awaiting refund."
1,FAIL,"I had read the reviews and I was nervous about this purchase, but I figured, it was worth a try. I really use my food processor a lot and the bowl had cracked rendering it unusable. I was expecting it might be the wrong color, or it might be a tight fit.It was the right color.It did not fit the lid at ALL. The bowl fit the base just fine. The lid however was off by at least .25"", meaning the whole thing is useless.Is this made by Cuisinart?? I found this in Amazon's ""Cuisinart Store"", but yet I can't believe this thing could possibly be anything but counterfeit."
1,Unacceptable,"I am not sure this is actually a Cuisinart part (it does not have any identifying markings), but I could live with a clone IF it worked. It does NOT fit my food processor. It is way too tight and almost impossible to get on or off without the risk of shattering. I used it once as a try-out; the work bowl would not easily come off its base. The next time I tried, I could not even get it on. Buyer beware."
3,new bowl doesn't quite fit the old base correctly,the new bowl is about an 1/8th off on the set-up position. I had to retro the base to fit the new bowl (shave off the 1/8th inch)
5,Necessary Replacement Part,"I bought this work bowl because I had to replace the old one after it cracked when I dropped it.It is a credit to the Cuisarts firm's integrity that they still make parts for a 35-year old machine. The new bowl fits perfectly. The safety latches work as they should. BTW, the motor on the food processor still works perfectly (another ++ for Cuisinart). I use mine instead of a bread machine."
1,Big disappointment!,I ordered this bowl hoping it would fit my Cuisinart DLC-8. It missed by a fraction of an inch. So much for standardizing. I thought I was going to save some money by not buying brand: that was a big mistake. I paid shipping and am still going to have to buy a bowl from Cuisinart which will fit. Next time I'll know.
5,Perfectly fine replacement part,"Received this just today and it fit the food processor base and lid just fine. No complaints - it was shipped promptly (although the post office lost it and delivered it almost 2 weeks later). I'm glad we finally replaced our old bowl, which was cracked and missing the handle. Should have done it a long time ago!"
3,Warped,"The original bowl crazed and cracked. I had to send the first replacement back because it was nearly impossible to lock into place, or unlock. I'm hoping that the next one will be better. I have a DLC-8E that's over 30 years old now, and it still has the original bowl (without all the fiddly extra locking bits they added which also eventually break).They don't make them like they used to, that's for sure.UPDATE: The replacement bowl fits fine. Kudos to Amazon for making it easy to replace. I still think Cuisinart has gone flimsy."
3,Does Not 'Fit' Easily,"This is my 4th replacement bowl for my Cusinart DLC-10 Plus which will be going off of warranty in 2015 and I have to say, this is the poorest 'fitting' work bowl of all of them. All of the previous bowls simply snapped into place, but this one takes an extra bit of pressure to get it to 'seat' correctly and if it is not placed exactly right, it takes several attempts to accomplish this.Of course, once locked into place it works as it's supposed to, but getting there is a bit of a struggle."
4,User error??,When i first received my Cuisinart 23 yrs ago I don't remember the bowl fitting so snugly. A few times over the years it went into the dishwasher and so i thought maybe the bowl got warped because my bowl was so tight on the base I thought i would break it trying to put it on or take it off. So I purchased a new one. This new one seems to fit just as snug. So snug in fact that when i put the bowl on the base if I'm not also holding it down the bowl doesn't align with guides. One of these days I think the handle will end up breaking off one or the other of the two bowls so i'm keeping it as a back up for when that happens. The lid and accessories all fit it so it is useful
4,Well played but to little effect,"This is probably the least (to me) satisfactory of all Galway recordings. Of course it is superbly played...but to what effect? Never has a Galway recording sounded so much like elevator music. The press release refers to this disc as ""his long-awaited crossover album."" Hmm. Long-awaited by whom, one might wonder.The ""pop ensemble"" then mentioned is not particularly elegant or impressive in any way, and their vocal intrusion on Track 11 is simply annoying. Mr. Galway may, of course, choose his own selections and/or allow them to be chosen for him. But this is definitely a step down for this master artist. I look forward to his re-crossing over as soon as possible."
5,Buy it simply for Track #6,"I actually obtained this CD from a friend who knows that I am a huge Aerosmith fan. Overall, it is a neat CD to have for your music collection. But ultimately I recommend purchasing this CD simply for Track #6. The outstanding live version of ""One Way Street"" is a perfect representation of Aerosmith at is ""baddest"". The song is a perfect mixture of rock, rhythm, and blues (along with musical solos) that gives the listener the perfect taste of what Aerosmith music is all about."
4,What are friends for..........???,"It's a sweet book for teens .....about things that go on among friends. Mindy Hamilton can't believe the change in Brian Swinton , her best firend , Janet's older brother. Over the summer , he has somehow transformed himself from a skinny , average guy into a major heartthrob!!! Mindy is used to Brian being obnoxious-not gorgeous. But when Brian seems interested in her , she's definitely pleased . But there's just one problem : Janet. As Brian and Mindy spend more and more time together , Janet maked it perfectly clear that she's not wild about her best friend dating her brother. But why???.....find out what Janet's problem is and how can Mindy find a way to make both Brian and Janet happy"
4,Limitations,"This opener works well on most natural and artificial corks; however, it will not open some of the artificial corks. When trying to open them, the cork screw just pulls out."
1,Not as pictured,This picture isn't the corkscrew you'll get! I specifically was looking for a straight screw type corkscrew. What I received was the curly pig-tail type corkscrew. Not the same thing at all and I prefer the straight type. Sigh.
1,No better than a cheap one!,"I trusted other reviews of this corkscrew. It's actually just another piece of cheap junk. It doesn't handle the plastic ""corks"" well at all. It's flimsy. Don't buy it."
5,"The best, from the best","If there is any question why LL is the best, get this CD. Please get this CD. This will end your discussion. By the time his sophmore album released, he was basking in the glory of his debut ""Radio"". But he soon fired back, with ""I'm Bad"", which has Cool J saying stuff like ""forget Oreos eat Cool J cookies"". Classic. Then he goes classic again with ""I Need Love"", his first hit to top the charts. LL keeps his lyrics def with ""Kanday"" and ""Ahh...Let's Get Ill"", but goes all out on ""My Rhyme Ain't Done"", where he says the Pope ""asked the Lord to raise Michaelangello from the dead/So he can make a fresh painting of my head"". His lyrics are amazing, and the beats can rock any party, now and years from now. This is his best album, and trust me. I thought ""Radio"" was tight, but this blew it out of the water. Listen to this and you'll see maybe he wasn't crazy to claim that he's the greatest of all time...."
5,HARD AS HELL and B.A.D. AS HELL! WHAT MORE DO U WANT?,"Released in the same year as Michael Jackson's ""Bad"" album, but this is not to be confused with the King of Pop! Straight hardcore rhythms & rhymes from start to finish. ""I'm Bad"" was Gangsta Tough before people even invented the term. ""Go Cut Creator"" blended thrash & rap before Rage Against the Machine. ""I Need Love"" pre-dated all of the R&B-laced stylings of today's rap. This album was seminal in Rap Music's first big crossover breakthrough, in 1987- along with Run-DMC, the Fat Boys, and the Beastie Boys. Anybody wanting some significant Rap (and ROCK!) history just HAS to get this album. To those who thought rap was a fad, peep the words on ""On the Ill Tip"": 'The joke's on you, jack!'"
3,"""For the first time in my life, I see I need love""........","LL Cool J's second album, Bigger And Deffer, is a step back from his fabulous debut. There are great and and classic tracks wrapped around a bunch of filler. ""I'm Bad"" is one of my favorite hip hop songs of all time, and so is ""I Need Love"". A lot of this album was influenced by Run-DMC's ""Rasisng Hell"", with it's refences to nursery rhymes(""My Rhyme Ain't Done"") and its nod to rock and roll(""Go Cut Creator Go""). There are some funny(""The Bristol Hotel"" and ""Kanday"", which could be a follow-up to ""Dear Vyvette""), but the filler is to far and in between. I liked this album, as a kid, but not that much now; I would suggest ""Walking With A Panther"" for a good LL 80's album."
4,One of LL's better releases,"This album was released during the prime of LL's career and before he went soft and started rapping for the ladies. LL comes with the hard lyrics (aside from a couple tracks) and the track ""I'm Bad"" is, in my opinion LL Cool J's finest track. During the middle of the album, the production lags a little, which is really the only problem with this album. If you already own Radio and Mama Said Knock You Out, go ahead and pick this up. It serves as a nice reminder of what LL Cool J used to be as opposed to what he now is (One of those old washed up rappers that has gone commercial and soft). Best tracks: ""I'm Bad"", ""The Do Wop""."
4,I'm gonna need backup,"This is a strong album by one of the top rappers of all time. LL was really at the top of his game here. His rhymes were fresh and often funny. And his deejay Cut Creator provided some excellent samples for him to rap to. The album included his first hit single, ""I Need Love"", which was also the first important rap ballad. Fans of old school rap should enjoy this album a lot."
5,Office supplies,"the office of jloomisconstruction.com is always in need of good quality products to keep up with the business day. The fax paper I purchased from Amazon.Com was the right choice and the right price.After too many trips to too many stores I decided to ""shop-online"" and it was so easy, I was besides myself."
1,A Rip-Off!,"This is cheaply made, narrator does not say player's names, footage is bad. I could not watch more than five minutes. What a terd! Not worth even a nickel. Skip it, Noles' fans."
4,"intresting and easy to use, once you've learned how to use it","I found this device when I was house setting for my cousin. It took me about 10 minutes to figure it out how to use it. My lever type corkscrew broke eralier this year and the cheap regular waiter type corkscrew is not working out well for me, so I am buying one of these soon.[update] Feb. 2010. Well, I have been using this since last March and I average using it about every other day. It worked great until I brought it with me to a restaurant and left it there a couple of months ago. I just order another one and will be sure to leave it at home. Also, I also experience difficulty opening synthetic cork in only one occation (can't recall the name of the wine) where the screw came out without removing the cork, but it worked with many other wines with synthetic corks."
1,pedrini Wine & Bar automatic corkscrew,"This item did not work as designed I have an old one that works every time but this one gets hung up.,"
3,HARD TO USE,"Maybe it is me...I have small hands...but this is very difficult to use.The point does not want to go in the cork....it took me 15 minutes, and I almost quit...till after literally pushing and turning, it finally started to work...my advice...look for another product!"
5,Bigger.,"These pencils pleased me because they are soft, simple, and slightly bigger round than drawing pencils. I love the feel of them and the nice dark lines they make. For sketching, nothing serious, these are my favourites now. I have to have them with me when I go anywhere. What more can I say? They are pencils."
1,Did not get money's worth,"Did you know there are 24 episodes in this season? That means I am missing 19(30min)shows. I did not get what I paid for therefore I have lost my ""Fate in the Future"" of contining to by these series."
3,"An enjoyable follow-up, but not quite up to par","If you liked The Actor's Guide to Murder, then you'll probably also enjoy The Actor's Guide to Adultery. However, as is common with sequels, the lack of freshness is evident throughout this book. There are at least two sections that are taken nearly word-for-word from the first novel. Also, Jarrod's mishaps with his cell phone are amusing the first time, but not so the second, third, or fourth time. Also, there are way too many coincidences that merely add distraction to the plot, rather than amusement. And the resolution is a bit too convoluted, but it had to be because the author created such an incredibly crowded plot, really TOO crowded. Still, despite these criticisms, the book is enjoyable, Jarrod is a funny main character, and the scenes involving the making of Jarrod's movie Creeps are very funny. Let's hope Rick Copp can bring a fresher perspective to the next book in this series!"
4,"It's ""phat and all dat ""","redman is very good on lyrics and stuff , but his aldum is a bit too old shcool ,but I'd love to here more of his music coz he has 'dat thang' that wiil get you hooked if you are a hard core fan !!!"
5,Funk Doc Vol. 2,"Redman comes more raw than ever with his second album. Laced with bass heavy P-Funk samples, like his first album, Redman tears up the mic with his unique flow and eccentric subject matter. His lyrics really do come from Darkside! Dr. Trevis is hilarious in the interludes and the intro! The beats will have your trunk thumpin for quite a while."
5,"Oh yeah mothas, some cosmic slop for ya head.","Redman's best, without any doubt. Possibly one of the greatest hip-hop albums ever, despite being so god damn slept on. I mean, yeah, this is a stoner album as others have said, but that'd be missing most of the point. Redman stomps all over the lurching smoked-out-of-the-mindframe beats, steeping the album in some unspoken paranoia. This would NEVER get on the top 40. Hazy and raw, what more could you ask for?"
3,Darkside,"This CD is OK. I wanted more after I heard 'Redman Muddy Waters', but for me, it wasn't as good.Still some real good songs, and some great lyrics. Buy Muddy Waters first.'more deadlier than a whole school system of asbestos'. HAH"
3,Cosmic heavy,"When I got this album I was not expecting redman to be so strange. I did not go for it. I liked some of the songs, but the one I liked best was an interlude Rockerfella. I was upset at that being only one minute. After listening to it time again I still can't get myself to go past 3 stars on this one, the only other song I liked was winicomearound."
1,The beats all sound the same,"Get double or nuthin by Erick Sermon or Enigma by Keith Murray if you want laid back bassy beats, becouse the beast on this albums for most parts are horribly annoying...I like Redmans newer stuff but not this one..."
2,Not his best...,"Ok, i read the other reviews on here and felt it wasnt fair to lets this go. Im a huge Redman fan, but this record is just not that great. The production is weak and hazy, and lyrically, Red has put out many better things. Really, if you want to hear good Redman, you have to go post-'Muddy Waters.' Doc's Da Name is a far better representation of his talent. Check out Blackout with Meth, or a Def Squad record (esp. El Nino) to hear his true skills. This is not a work that he should be judged by. I think quick and somewhat sloppy production, and a lack of diverse beats hurt this record. Dont waste $, pick it up used and then return it."
1,Original's were much better,This is pretend stuff. Search the cut-outs or amazon for the original artists. You'll get a chill and a thrill.
5,BEST ALAN JACKSON EVER!,"I don't think any Alan Jackson CD is bad but this one is great! I love all these old songs. They bring back such great memories. Alan does a wonderful job with them! I have not been as thrilled with a whole CD as this one since they released ""The Outlaws"" on CD."
4,Traditional country music at its BEST!,"I have all of Alan's cd's and this one is the most country of them all. It is not the usual upbeat music but more of the traditional music that is kind of a welcome sign for country music lovers. Buy the cd, if you enjoy great old country music in Jackson style."
5,One of Alan's Best,"Alan Jackson is truly one of the best new country singers around. I enjoyed his version of all of these songs. He actually sings them better than the original singers, Farewell Party and Kiss An Angel Good Morning are so well done. I hope he comes out with another CD of this kind."
5,Good Old Country Music,"I received my C.D. from Amazom.com and I have played it over and over. Alan does a great job of the ""oldies"". I was in total agreement of what he did at the CMA Awards. Thank you Alan, for bringing back Country Music."
3,Nice Try,"I was somewhat disappointed. Alan Jackson, for lack of a better word, seems uncomfortable on the record. Every song on here, I liked so much better by the original artist. I appreciate this record, because I love all of the old singers and can't stand this new country sound. But, I'd like to hear Alan make another album like this...and this time sound like he's having a good time."
2,Go buy the original artist cd! Leave this one on the shelf,Alan Jackson has done it! He ran out of fresh material. These songs are classics and deserve to be heard again. But they deserve to be heard the by the legends that made them famous. Leave this one alone and go get the originals.
2,Not a particularly inspired set of songs,"Alan Jackson's ""Under the influence"" is yet another roots attempt by a new country act that doesn't revive true country. While the album has some great choices, such as the excellent George Jones classic ""Once you've had the best"", the vast majority of the songs come from novelty sources (""Pop a top"") or from country acts that invented the countrypolitan style that now dominates country music (Don Williams).There are no songs on this album that were originally done by such true legends of country music such as Moon Mullican, Jimmie Rodgers, Hank Williams Sr., Jerry Lee Lewis, Bill Monroe or Hank Snow. Any worthwhile 'going back to my roots' album should primarily focus on real country from the stylists. Regarding that, this album only honours George Jones while the other songs are mainly by countrypolitan acts of a modern heritage."
5,I LOVE This CD!,"I never heard of this CD before my aunt, uncle, and cousins came to new york from texas and they had it. They played it non-stop and I know they would also give it 5 stars. The song ""Pop A Top"" has some sentimental value to me, and I could never get tired of it. Now, every time I hear it, I think of the texans. But the rest of the CD is also wonderful. I dont really like country music that much, but I really love this CD. Its great!"
5,That Jackson Boy Delivers the Best,"Alan Jackson's ""Influences"" will be proud as a peacock of this CD -- anyone who remembers the greatest hits from the mighty Merle Haggard,Don Williams, George Jones, and Johnny Paycheck will love it. Unlike most CD's there is not one song that is ""half-baked"". Alan has made sure that the music, the lyrics, and his flawless baritone voice blend together to present the finest mix of country music around. The instrumental portions, especially in The Blues Man, are totally awesome. Margaritaville has a dry sense of humor that will get you laughing every time you hear it. Once a true Alan Jackson fan, you are hooked for life---and for those of us who have purchased his CD's from the beginning, we know that this guy just gets better and better, and this CD is TOPS! Go out and buy this SUPER CD (but PLEASE, only if you love traditional country music)!"
5,real Country,"Thank God somebody still sings COUNTRY like it should be. I am so sick of seeing Shania Twain, Martina Macbride and all these people who think they are country strut across the stage showing off their figures. I was raised on real hard core country and that is still my favorite. I was so proud of Alan for singing George Jones song on the awards show. At least somebody cares. I get so tired of hearing the same new songs on radio. Why can't these crazy disc jockeys throw in some old songs too? We had a radio station that played almost all oldies and everybody praised them and then all at once somebody bought them out and away went the GOOD COUNTRY MUSIC. Thanks Alan. We love you."
3,Nice...but a little boring,"Alan Jackson's salute to traditional country music has some great song, but has a tendency to become boring. I've listened to it maybe 3 times in the past 4 months, and the first 2 times were within a week after I bought it."
3,SSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSCCCCCCCCCCOOOOBBBBBBBBBBYYYYYYYYYYYY DDDDOO,Um yeah montell is good and all but 2pac was (and still is) the BEST!!!!!!!!!!!!
4,===Money is just tremendous!===,"Montell Jordan (a.k.a. Money) has his own unique style and it's untouchable. The man is one of the most gifted in the R&B scene, plain and simple. It's not only his amazing voice, but it's also his awesome production skills and his ability to mix new-school style with older style of R&B. His verses are fresh and many of the songs have a strong hip hop feel in them. Montell even raps on a few of the songs and he does it well. And don't think that the party anthem ""This is How We Do It"" is the only song to love on the album. There's a lot of other GREAT songs you'll love to hear again and again. Montell is so talented, whether it's singing or producing the songs. That's something real rare and combined with his charisma it makes MJ untouchable. This is his first album... Check out the rest as well."
5,This is how we do it!!!,"I love ""This is how we do it""!! This is a great party song to dance too!! Get's you off your feet!!"
3,One of the best songs but not one of his best albums,"I'm an album person. I like the most of the album to be listenable. This album wasn't. It had 4 songs - Something 4,payback,daddy's home, of course the title track. I think he tried to implement ""This is how we do it"" into most of his songs. But if u like the 4 songs only on this albums. Buy all of his albums because this and Get it on tonite are the worst one!"
5,Great resource guide,Everything you need to know about assistive technology and new laws about assistive technology.
4,"Worth the Money, Even New!","I was surprised by how much I liked this book. I have read oodles of Mercedes Lackey and like it as light, comforting reading. But I'm running out of her Valdemaran titles, which are my favorites, and I hoped this book would give me some new authors to peruse. Michelle West's <i>The Memory of Stone</i> is worth the book by itself. I suppose that the book could make you feel like an outsider to some of the authors' worlds presented within, but I felt that almost all of the stories were easy to get a handle on and great fun to read. If you want serious reading, it's probably not the best choice, but if you want to be seriously entertained, I recommend it highly!"
4,A class of its own,A very well made movie. Soumitra Chatterjee has been given the perfect role to bring out one of his best performances ..if not the best.
3,No subsance but enjoyable for silliness,"The Hills, like Laguna Beach, is definitely a guilty pleasure. I usually watch silly shows like this one when I'm in lab working on projects since they don't require a lot of concentration. Season 1 seems to stress on nightlife and boys, but seriously LA is more than just nightlife and boys. I suppose these kids are young, and their parents are rich. There's no point in them working hard because no one is depending on them."
5,yeeeees,I still haven't finished watching i love the hills I love lauren conrad since laguna beach this item came really fast and i love it thank u
1,Tacky,Even the opinion by people who are just on the outskirts of this circle...tacky tacky and disappointing. Such is the fantasy.
4,Fabulous,"I am not gonna be ashamed because I watch The Hills. I am 35 years young and love it. I like Lauren and thought it was a good strategie to follow her career. Who wants to know about the other caracters in Laguna Beach. I thought she was the one who was focused about what she wanted. The serie could definitly be a insight for girls who want to dropp out of school. For instance Heidi I hope she will try to get to college back even when it's night school. I did it and have a bachelor degree. I will also go to university to learn Japan. So to get back to this DVD. It fantastic a real documentary and definitly fashionable like the movie ""The Devil Wears Prada"". Many girls of this age will and can relate with there problems and life issues."
1,I never receice The DVD's!!!!,Please help me to coordinate or informare me if The DVD was Delivery because i didnt receice The first season.
4,I'm All Mixed Up about where KoRn was going with this,"We have this sweet lil EP or whatever with four well-known korn songs and a remake of all of ours favorite christmas song. Only get this CD if you are a die-hard fan of KoRn like me, other than that it's not worth the money. Jingle Balls was kind of entertaining though."
3,Might be a little too far,"I could play Korn on one stereo and old school techno on the other...or I could just buy this CD. All it is is Korn with a little bit of techno dubbed over it. Not too creative. I bought it because I like Korn and it looked different, but its really not something to write home about."
3,Pretty good,"This is a good EP, but it's not very good, but it's definatly not a bad EP. Here's a run-down of the songs:1. A.D.I.D.A.S. (Radio Edit)-2/5-I hate this version. But the dirty version ownz!!!2. Good God (Dub Pistols Mix)-1/5-OMG! What the hell happened? Good God is an awesome song, but this song sucks!3. Got the Life (Josh Abraham Remix)-4/5-Wow! A good remix!!!! The song is the same vocally, but the guitars, basses and drums are replaced with techno beats.4. Twist/Chi (Live)-4/5-If you own the Family Values Tour '98 CD you should know this song.5. Jingle Balls-6/5-Seriously, this is the real reason to buy this thing!!!Bottom line:It's a good EP."
2,Not up to Korn Standards.,"I know that this is an EP and it doesn't cost too much but its still a waste of money. The ADIDAS remix is really no different than the normal version. The Good God Remix is just plain Horrible. The Got the Life Remix is the only decent remix. The Twist/chi live can be found on Family Values 98. Jingle balls is decent, though."
3,You don't REALLY need it,"For the price that this CD usually goes for, it's a good enough deal, but you won't get much listening value out of it. The live version of Chi is from the FV98 disc, the ""Radio Mix"" of A.D.I.D.A.S. is the version played in the video (You know, humping). The Good God Remix is absolutely horrible, I cannot express that enough. The Josh Abraham Remix of Got the Life is really cool and Jingle Balls is a really weird, festive song. Overall, it's not a bad deal, but there isn't much on here to write home about."
4,Pointless for new fans,Most of the remixes on this one are prettty [bad].Buy it used for Jingle balls.
1,Don't Waste Your Money!!,I bought this product because I needed a portfolio to carry around my paper work for my job. the product worked great for about 2 days till the seam split and I was left with a 2 piece portfolio.... this item is made of cheap plastic over cardboard and is not very sturdy at all.. I would not recommend this product to anyone that wants something that will last more than about 2 days..
3,Average,"It's an average pad holder. Kinda cheap and flimsy, but decent for the price. Looks like it will probably fall apart in less than a year, but I'll hope for the best."
2,Very Low Quality,"Was hoping for a replacement for previous lost pad holder of Naugahyde. This is made of the thinnest plain vinyl which undoubtedly will crack irreparably ere long. Even the clamp is so lightweight it Barely doesn't bend, poorly attached to the back, and the cardboard in the back is so thin it threatens to bend beyond recovery whenever you press on the clamp."
4,Pad Holder,"I have purchased this holder many years ago. It does a good job. I take it with me on appointments. It allows me a good writing surface. It is not super strong but strong enough to work when I need it. The inside is good, too. It holds my letter size pads and gives me an area to put my papers on the left side."
5,BEST Book,I work for a company that finished a multimillion project on the WEB in 5 months. Most of it front end manipulations were done with the help of this book. Remote Scripting and this book will help you make big bucks.
3,Experienced Programmer? Try another book.,"I purchased this book along with O'Reilly's ""JavaScript: The Definitive Guide"" to help me learn JavaScript *fast* for a big project.While Goodman's text and examples were interesting, as an experienced developer I found the O'Reilly book far more useful, both for its detailed explanation of the language and its reference.What would greatly improve this book, imho, would be a page layout redesign and some more serious editing. A sharper focus on intended audience (beginner at JavaScript? beginner at WWW? etc.) wouldn't hurt, either.I remain a fan of Danny Goodman's work -- and I don't consider my purchase of this book a waste of money -- but I feel he does his best work with other publishers."
3,Update needed,"This book is a better reference manual than it is a ""how-to"" book. At times the lessons take itty-bitty steps, but at the same time fails to explain some basic terminology. Much of the information is outdated. It's a fairly complete reference, but not the book to teach you Javascript."
3,Ups and Downs,"I had such a great time working through most of the material in the first 8 chapters of this book. The examples were clear and helped me to thoroughly implement what I was learning. During chapter 9, I started to get annoyed with the typos, poor answers to some of the Tutorial Exercises, and examples that were irrelevant to anything I wanted to accomplish. At the end of chapter 10, I decided to move on to an O'Reilly book.This book strengthened my base in programming principles. I appreciated the explanations, when they were written thoroughly. When I get confused, I dig in stubbornly until I figure it out. Perhaps someone who breezes past the confusing parts will do better with this book."
2,Difficult to follow,"I'm a frustrated beginner at Javascript. This book is part of what frustrated me. It's not very clear, with not enough examples and not enough details all at the same time. Much later, after I put down this book in frustration, I picked up WROX press' ""Beginning Javascript,"" which I find much easier to follow. If only I had started with that book instead of this one!"
4,I use this book a lot,"With a couple of hours of HTML, this book (ed 3) is immediately useful. I have now been using it for about a year which speaks for itself. It is good as an HTML supplement too. I liked the examples many of which helped my real world 'on the job' needs. eg. field edits. Compatability notes for each command were useful as were the work arounds for older IE and Netscape browsers. Also introduced me to Javascript debugger - a very useful tool. Good index. Down Side? A little out of date now. I needed other sources for Style Sheets (HTML) and Layers and the IE equivalent. This is still the best book I have on Javascript."
4,Great Book For Beginners.,If you are a beginner/intermediate with javascript this is the book for you. I started out knowing a good bit about javascript and this book helped me out a little. It's a good reference for anything you need to know about javascript. Other than using it as a reference I didn't have much use for it. But it's good none the less.
5,It gets you going fast,"I find this book to be very comprehensive. If you want to learn JavaScript this book brings you along like a course book. At the end of each chapter there are exercises that test you to make sure you understood the chapter. If you don't, you know what to re-read.All you need to learn Javascript is a computer, a browser, this book and understanding of the english language. That is a gap that the Author did not fill.Happy Scripting!"
4,Good Tutorial and detailed reference.,"If you already know OO programming, this is a good introduction to Javascript. The tutorial will get you going quickly, and reads in about a week. The bulk of the book is a reference to the Javascript objects. CD also contains a large library of objects."
2,This book is NOT a cross-browser reference,"This book should not claim that it covers both Netscape Navigator and Internet Explorer - this is false advertising. It reads like a Netscape manual for Navigator programming with few occasional references to IE. As for contents, it is a book for beginners."
3,"A book to beginners, NOT FOR EXPERIANCED PROGRAMMERS",This book is excelled for someone how doesn't know about programming. It is an overkill for an experienced programmer. I found myself just skimming over the pages and extracting useful information. There is allot of fluff. The book could be cut down into 500 pages instead of 1015 pages.
3,I am not taking away from what Mr. Goodman has done...,"This is a great book for javascripting if you are new to either programming or web in general. There are in-depth coverages for just about all categories of problems that you may run into. However, this is not the bleeding-edge book that I had hoped to find (is there one?). I ended-up skimming through most of the pages only to find that I've already known most of it. For power users, this book will be a good reference, but it won't teach you many new things."
5,"Written for progressive JavaScripting, great learning aid.","I thoroughly enjoyed Danny Goodman's Javascript Bible, 3rd Edition. It is easy to follow and usually simple enough to search for subjects in the index, incase you need to find a specific Javascript command for your needs. Highly recommended. If you have a JavaScript programmer waiting to get out inside you, this will be a good book to add to your JavaScript learning experience.P.S. I especially appreciated Danny Goodman's fast response when I emailed him not long ago about a minor glitch on some coding example found in the book. Good customer support. Way to go Danny! Keep it up ;-)"
2,Too general for Intermediate programmers,"The Books does a good job of explaining Javascript and designing simple function. For Intermediate programmers looking for tips in making your pages dynamic, this is not the book for you. Your best bet is surfing on the Internet."
4,Cool book....to bad that it has some minor bugs.,It's really a must-have for the javascript programmer. All the things I want to know....and even cross browser examples that I thought were only possible at either IE or Netscape. To bad that it contains a article about modifying the toolbar/statusbar etc. Too bad that it doesnt work on Netscape 4.6 or Internet Explorer 5. Might be my fault....but it's just unworthy of the greatness of this book.
4,Hands down best JavaScript Reference around,"Originally I bought this book to help me learn and understand JavaScript. I have since moved on to other web-based languages, yet this book remains by my side and is as much a part of my work place as my chair. It has helped me to bring JavaScript, ASP, WebClasses, DHTML and many others together to provide excellent, high quality, and very versatile web pages. For anyone needing to break into JavaScript, refresh on some of the methods and properties, remember how to do this or that, or brush up on JavaScript, then this is the first book you need to look at. I gave this book 4 stars for if you really need to delve deep into JavaScript, then pick up an O'Reily book. But for a beginning or a reference, this one can't be beat!"
4,Solid way to learn JavaScript,"I purchased this book with the intent on learning JavaScript. This book does a more than adequate job of doing that. It gives pretty good examples and most of them actually work. I would suggest this book if you want an understanding of JavaScript, and some decent examples to use in real life situations."
5,JavaScript Bible 3rd Edition,"I am a VB developer and a newbie to JavaScript and HTML. This book is just what I needed to get my feet wet and started in JavaScript. The examples were very easy to follow and Mr. Goodman explained each section with simplicity so that a beginner with no programming knowledge could dive in and start scripting. For those of you who are looking for a good JavaScript book that will take you from beginning to advanced, this is the one."
5,The Best JS book I've seen...,"I'm not a programmer. I have been doing HTML for a couple of years tho. Usually, when needing a JavaScript, I would look at somebody else's, and then tweak it to suit my needs. I've bought other JavaScript books in the past...but never fully understood what I was doing.For the first time, I'm coding JavaScript, and actually *understanding* what each line of code does.A great book for JS beginners...teaches the basics without being condescending, or ""dummying things down""...but teaches in plain english.I cannot recommend this book enough."
3,Weak tutorial but probably a good reference.,"The tutorial in this book is confusing. I can write scripts by following the examples, but I'm not sure of what I am doing. Having never done any JavaScripting before, I based my purchase decision on the reviews here at Amazon. I am now going to buy a ""dummies"" book and use this as a reference."
4,Good book with worst index I've seen,"I've been reading this book on and off for about a year now. It seems easier to be used as a quick reference than Flanagan's Definitive Guide. But the index of this book is neither complete nor well-indented. If saving space is a concern, use smaller fonts. Yes, I found quite a few errors as other did. The good thing about the book is (I think) Goodman is a clear writer."
2,Not what i expected,"This book is 100% not for any beginner programmer or for reference use. Its big, and confusing. Should be used as a door holder.The only good thing is it explores all the aspects of Javascript which is good, you can find almost everything in here, but would take you a long time to find it. For reference use an Oreilly book and if you are a bignner use something like Visual Quickstart Guide to Javascript or Javascript in 24 hours.Bottom line for the money ad size there are better books out there!Hope I could of help you out...."
5,This book is the greatest,"This is the best book I've ever read. If you want to learn JavaScript, you've got to have this one."
4,Warning: for Beginners only,Anyone who has used Javascript before and has read the information provided on Microsoft's website will find little or no new information in this book.
1,Sorry but this book Sucks!,We're using this in my JavaScript class now and it's the worst book to learn from. Goodman doesn't explain well and when he is explaining he goes on about things not really relevant. The book could have used a really good editor or ghost WRITER. Goodman is certainly no writer. If I could've I'd have given this book a minus 1 stars!
3,Not for beginners.,"I am a beginner to programming. Armed only with HTML, I attempted to learn JavaScript with this book. And although I learned a lot, I found myself reading the first 12 chapters 3 times over just to understand it. If you're a beginner like me, try the SAMS book (avoid the QuickStart book unless you just want a mini cookbook of scripts). Although it was somewhat discouraging for me, I'm sure this will book will be a great reference once I have learned the basics, and I'm glad I own it."
5,Reference manual for all!,"Danny Goodman has outdone himself in this amazing reference manual! Starting with the Window Object and working down the DOM hierarchy, each chapter discusses the different objects and their properties, methods and events. The discussions and examples enable EVERYONE to understand how to implement Javascript code into their Website. This book has detail down to which browser and what version is compatible with the code you are about to write. This book would get 10 stars if that many were available."
2,You wont learn Javascript from this,"This is my third Javascript book.Like the others,the author teaches you some very basic scripts,then expects you to be able to write and comprehend some huge script with things you haven't learned yet.It's like someone showing you how to check the oil in a car, then saying ""Ok, now rebuild the engine with what I've shown you"" Very dissapointing as it started out ok then launched into way advanced things."
3,"Good book, but riddled with errors","Danny G's books are hard to beat, but typing in scripts that don't work isn't helpful to a beginner. After frustrating myself to the extent of delirium, I went to Danny's site and found that the book contained 44 script errors that were to be manually updated by the buyer. Does anyone test these before sending them to the publisher? Ever hear of a copyeditor? Buy the book, but buy a sharpie also to correct all the errors."
2,Not The Best,"I bought this thick book (over 1000 pages) for $90AU and expected that by the time I finish reading it I would know Javascript from Start to Finish with no hinderences. I think this book would be very good for people that already know Javascript moderately because its reference is very extensice and good, but for teaching the language I don't think it qualifies as a good read. It is not layed out very well for newbies, and what about errors, even though there is a webpage at www.dannyg.com to download and read, it is very annoying to have to look at the error sheet to see if the example given doesn't have any errors to confuse the situation any more. For $90 I don't think it is the best Javascript book available on the market."
3,Great for a developer..not so great for a newbie,If you are totally new to programming (like I was) this book will not in itself be the one for you. I have recently purchased an other book (JavaScript in 24 hours) which i luckily read first. It's a bit high level for a newbie delving into the core aspects of JS. If you have minimal knowledge you may to be able to get by. My suggestion to people who have purchased this book and find it overwhelming is to keep it on the shelf. When this book is aided by a lower level intro book (such as JavaScript in 24 hours) you will have little troubles understanding the basics of OOM.From a web designers perspective (which I am) This book will not offer the latest and greatest tricks to make the world wow at your latest creation. BUT it will lay a great foundation to which you will easily be able to add other scripting languages to your portfolio.It's kind of like that medicine your mom made you take as a kid....it tastes awful but works.
2,Not at all good for a beginner as it states,"I'm a newcomer to programming. The author gives tutorials with lessons at the end. When you look up his answers, he presents you with lingo that he has yet to talk about. How he expects anyone to understand something they have yet to learn bedazzles me. He starts slow so you open the CD and cancel your return options, but then gets very technical very fast. Too fast for a beginner. Maybe for intermediate readers. Try Netscape Javascript 1.2 if you are a newcomer like me. They are very slow and smooth. This was an excellent learning tool and they are the Javascript Pros. Unfortunately, I had alredy wasted my time trying to read three other books. Make this your first choice and enjoy."
2,No Patient to read through,It is good for you if you are a beginner and have patient to read through from the beginning to the end. It is not very helpful if you already know some javascript. JUNK!!!
5,Simply the best JavaScript tutorial to read,"I truly enjoyed the week I spent going through Mr. Goodman's book. In a very easy-to-read format, he explains the basic concepts of JavaScript programming, and his examples will immediately inspire you with thoughts of how to apply the concepts. His examples are excellent and informative -- every one I tried ran correctly right off the CD (in Netscape 4.04).While not as rich in sample code and intimate syntax as Sun's ""Jumping JavaScript,"" it's a great complement to that book. I'd get them both, read Goodman's (esp. the first 15 chapters) to become familiar with the language, then use both for their valuable examples of how to implement the language and make your web pages dance.Happy reading, all!"
4,Good examples in the book,"This book is very good at explaining the levels of programming in regards to JavaScript. Excellent examples, although it has quite a bit of fluff. At 1000 pages I thought I was getting a definative 'bible', but actually found a lot of code example in big text rather than in-depth explanations, which is what I expected. Good content, but not as thorough as I'd have hoped."
3,It's Good But Could Be Better,"In general Goodman's JavaScript Bible is a good book. It covers both the basics and advanced details.However, Goodman tries to please both beginners and experienced programmers, which leads to a dilemma. Goodman spends a lot of time explaining basic general programming guidlines to beginners, which is a waste of time for experienced programmers. On the other hand, advanced details in this book are intimidating to beginners. Goodman tries to put Nordstrom and One Dollar Maze under one roof. How sad is that?I compared this book with other titles before I bought it. I still believe it's a good choice. But it could be improved."
5,Simply the best.,"Simply put, this is the best book available on JavaScript. The organization is just awesome. They group programming fundamentals first and they're covered thoroughly to give you a firm grasp on the syntax of JavaScript. Then you move on to the reference part of the book with full explanations of all the commands and functions built into JavaScript. I find myself constantly referring to this section when I'm scripting. And then you get to take everything you learned and apply it to real world examples. Once you've made it through this beast of a book, you'll have mastered JavaScript and be able to code it in your sleep.

2,Simplistic; Poor Reference,"Judging from all of the positive reviews here, this book must have its place. However, as an experienced VB programmer, I was looking for a tutorial AND reference. The tutorial is rather simplistic and focuses primarily on Netscape, a browser which is quickly becoming the minority. My biggest gripe though, is the lack of any sort of command reference. For me, a good reference is as important to the learning process as a clearly written tutorial."
5,LL When he was all about rockin' the mic,"Def Jam's 1st artist's debut 1995 release is a TRUE HIP-HOP classic. IF YOU DON'T KNOW ALL THE LYRICS FROM ALL OF THE SONGS ON THIS CD, YOU TRULY ARE NOT A REAL RAP FAN! Come on now, ""Rock the Bells"", ""Dear Yvette"", ""You'll Rock"", ""I Can Give You More""? THATS NOT JUST MUSIC, THATS RAP HISTORY! ENOUGH SAID!"
4,The Real Deal,Iam the world's greatest hip-hop fan from New York and this album is a classic for the generations to come.
5,VERY beginning must read,"This book was great, in my opinion, because i have NO clue.I'm sure for anyone w/ more business operation knowledge it lends less assistance.I was glad to find a extreme basic book that gets me up to speed and lets me know the basics before i move into the next and intermediate level reading on this topic.It's cheap - and it presents information that COULD change your mind or confirm your ideas ... good investment :)"
2,"Mediocre and naive, at best","Such absurd statements such as, ""Let us consider that you have $100,000, and that that amount is exactly what you require to fulfill your dream. At the present interest rates, your money, in a very safe term deposit, will earn approximately $9,000 each year."" If this were true, no one would be investing in the economy and inflation would be out of control. By ""very safe"", I think more like a savings account with 1% return. The book is also full of lists with no explanation of the items or terms."
2,Yow to Open your Own Restaurant...A Loser of a Guide,"This is a very small book written by two men who obviously have restaurant experience, but who have very poor writing/communications skills. This book is not a guide to setting up the spreadsheets necessary to open a restaurant. It is doubtful that the authors even know how to open up Lotus or Excel. The amount of essential items left out are humongous. Watch yourself! Not a recommendable expenditure of any money whatsoever on this crummy attempt at producing a useful ""book"". Rating: eight onions."
5,GREAT CASE!!! LOVE IT!!!,"I purchased this for work. It's awesome, I love it. It fits two 17 inch laptops and two Shon Harris CISSP books in it and room for power adapter and a few ties above the books. It's nice and roomy. It is all black inside. There is no brown like in the other pictures. The wheels and back part of it is detachable which is nice. The leather is nice, I've hit it against so many things and it still looks new. I actually have a coworker that's gonna get it. I researched for a case for about 2 months, and got this one. It hasn't dissappointed."
5,EXCELENT PRODUCT,"I really liked because has good capacity, is strong made and you can used with or without the wheels. Also is very good finished and the cheaper price on web for the same quality product. Highly recommended."
5,nice,Very nice piece the Wheels are made good. Nice and roomy inside. Its nice to have the option of using the wheels verses carrying it.
2,Not a collection of movies,"This is a documentary. There are no movies in this collection. If you are looking for a good documentary, then this is for you. I should have looked at it closer before I bought the video. Now I am stuck with it."
4,Three Days Grace The Next Bigtime Stars,"After istening to the threee days grace cd I couldn't belive how great they were!! I could relate with the songs and sing along with them the second time i listened to it. This band deals with scarry stories,relationships,gettin stoned and just be a teenager. I think that if they keep this up that they will be the next Korn or Limp Bizkit.The reason that i didn't give this band 5 stars is because is some of there song the say the f word and i'm not sure if that would be a problem for some listeners. You should definetly go out spend the money and GET THIS CD!!THREE DAYS GRACE THE NEXT BIG STARS!! By Pauline Borger"
4,Great CD for when your mad at the world,"Great CD. Must Buy. If you like Smile Empty Soul and Nickleback, this CD is for you!"
5,"This is a MUST HAVE cd, i promise there will be no regrets!",Three Day's Grace self titled debut album has to be one of the best cd's I have and i'm sure that anyone else who has it must agree with me. The lyrics and sound are incredible. It's one of those cd's that you can listen to straight through and not have to skip any songs..yes it's that good! I can't even pick a favorite song and if you think the cd is good you should see them live!!
1,Im Sick Of This Flood Of Crap I Want Good Music Back,"This is a weak band it sounds like everything out there right now while everyones digging these clwons im digging Pink Floyd, Led Zeppelin, The Who, Pearl Jam, Nine Inch Nails, And Tool, and the bands i like sound alot better than Three Days Grace whats happening to music?!?!?!?!?!?!?!? jeeeez avoid this lump of junk and go get Tool Aenima or Pearl Jam vs"
4,THE RADIO RUINED THIS ALBUM...,"THESE SONGS WERE GOOD, HARDENED ROCK SONGS UNTIL THE RADIO GOT AHOLD OF THEM...I ORDERED THIS CD AFTER I HEARD I HATE EVERYTHING ABOUT YOU ON FUSE TV...IT WASNT WHEN IT FIRST CAME OUT, BUT STILL PRETTY CLOSE...LONG STORY SHORT, I HEARD THAT SONG SO MANY TIMES BEFORE I RECIEVED THE CD IN THE MAIL, THAT I WANTED TO SEND IT BACK...I LIKE THE REST OF THE SONGS ON THE CD, BUT WHEN I HEAR THAT TRACK IT ALMOST MAKES ME SICK, AND I GET A BAD TASTE IN MY MOUTH ABOUT THE REST OF THE ALBUM, WHICH IS ACTUALLY A GOOD MIX...ANYWAY, THE SONGS THAT ARENT ON THE RADIO ARE PRETTY GOOD, BUT AFTER THAT, THERE ISNT MUCH TO IT...I LISTEN TO IT WHEN I GET ANGRY, GOOD ANGRY MUSIC, YUP...AIGHT, IM OUTTA HERE,-CHRIS-"
2,"Music is good enough, but the message needs some help","Have listened to this album several times, and I'm torn. I like the music well enough, the song writing is decent, but its so obvious that either one of two things has happened here:1) This singer/songwriter is lost on an extremely self destructive and abismal path through life.OR2) This whole venture is completely controlled by a record label to exploit 15 year old teenage angst.And me now at the age of 25 and happily married, I cannot relate, and I see through the BS of what he says and how he sees the world."
2,Unimaginative,"I just purchased this cd a few days ago. After listening to it a couple times, I discovered that it wasn't a very good cd. The lyrics are cliched teen angst. Anger at parents, unaccepting peers, self-loating etc. They seem to have found a sound... and stick with it -- the exact same sound throughout the entire album. Each song sounds suspiciously like the last one. This cd is unimaginative at best."
1,Everything about it is terrible,"A friend let me hear it, and I had a feeling it would be terrible after hearing the horrendous 3 radio hits(home, just like you, and i hate everything about you. This is the formula for 3 days grace's success(as well as a lot of other bands): Go to drop D tuning and bash powerchords and have a terrible singer in the back scream. After playing guitar for about a month I was able to play everything on this terrible album forwards and backwards. Of the 3 hits the worst was ""home"". What an awful uncreative song. The other two songs are nearly as bad. The songs are all about bitter feelings most likely toward girls...What a group of posers. The sad thing is this awful uncreative excuse for a band is that they will probably make a good chunk of money in there terrible career where great newer bands like Shadows Fall or Mastodon won't make a quarter of it."
1,Ok...,"So maybe it doesn't deserve 1 star, but the average should not be more than stars! The lyrics are just so terribly repetitive and pointless. These guys are trying to copy Finger Eleven and are sucking at it. I am very dissapointed to see that bands like this are outshining true talent from bands such as Matthew Good, The Mars Volta, and Dredg. It's a really big shame to see that bands that can make one catchy song can become huge. I'm not saying catchy is bad, but when that's the only thing going for it, it's not good. So, I'm going to say that if you are one of the very many who enjoy the steady decline of true talent and excellence in music, then buy this piece of crap. I'm sure you'll like it. But if you are one of the people left in America who still knows real music when you hear it, pass this garbage on to your 12 year old cousin."
4,Gives me the musical chills,this is a cd that you can feel while you're listening to it. i love the harmonies and the intstrumentals. you can tell that these guys have lived or believe in what they're singing. the variety of the songs and the way they contrast eachother shows real artistry. it's not a cd that you skip over every other song because it keeps your interest. it's very deep and emotional. even the cover of the cd is intriguing and sort of shows the mystery of the album.
5,3DG ROCKS!!,"Three Days Grace kicks ass! Their CD is only full of great songs. They strong vocals, lyrics, and music. Their guitar is really good. You can listen to their CD non-stop and never get tired of it beacuse it is THAT good. My favorites are Drown, i Hate Everything About you, Now or Never, Born Like This, and Home... just to narrow it down (ha). Well, all their songs are REALLY REALLY GOOD. GREAT!! KICK-ASS!! Get their CD and support 3DG!! They rock and that's all there is to it."
4,3.75 would be a better rating,"These guys know how too play music, I am just questioning how well they can write it: Better than me obviously, but not good enough for me to listen to this cd more than 3 times.This cd starts off with 3 great, unique songs. Burn, and the 2 singles. The rest of the songs definetly have some great hooks and sound very solid, but it seems like 5 or more songs have the same lead in to their chorus. I did like most of the songs the first time through the disk, but it was just too repeative. The band sounds a lot like finger eleven, except this cd was 10x more solid then F11's latest release. That disk however had some unique diamonds in the rough, this cd was the exact opposite. Everything was exterior, no hidden layers that you find the 3rd or 4th time through.Overall though, this debut was good enough that I will probably find myself buying their sophomore effort when or if it comes out."
3,OK,"This album only has 2 good songs, Burn and Home. A lot of songs sound the same the singer sings the same way in all the songs and the guitar riffs are limited.GETS old just download home and burn, and save your money. I mean its ok but it has no Stand Out features."
3,Good cd but...,"Ok, first of all, I really do like this group. They have a good sound, loads of energy, and the tunes are really easy to get into. However, my problem was when I saw them live. THEY SUCK HAIRY BUTT LIVE! The lead singer apparently cannot sing on tune outside of the studio to save his life, and the band has almost no energy when they are in front of a crowd...they kind of just stood there and played, with no heart at all. Of course, the crowd sucked really badly too (Evanescence fans apparently only like Evanescence...d*@#ed posers). Still, all of that aside, they can make some descent music. They have a lot of potential, and hopefully they'll use it for their next album (and maybe the lead singer can practice hitting notes for the future as well)."
5,Just like you,"three days grace debut album was better then i expected, they are better then other bands i hear.there songs are great. the songs i particularly like is:i hate everything about youscaredjust like youi think this is great. no they dont sound like the bands you hear on the radio cause the bands on the radio you dont wanna hear again, three days grace is a band you want to hear over and over again.its worth the money, buy this cd!"
5,Too good for words,"My friend burned this cd for me , because I am a poor loser :-(. I love it! It really comes in handy on bad days of a teenage life. All the angry lyrics reach out for you and kind of steal your anger away. Instead of throwing things across the room you just pop in this CD and BAM! You're relaxed. I can really relate to many of these songs. The first song I heard was I Hate Everything About You. A must hear, and the video is a must see. I love Three Days Grace, they are now a favorite of my very large collection."
2,Zymn's Happy Review,"Hi everybody! I am hear to tell you the LIES of the other reviews here! I, like everyone else, wished to acquire THREE DAYS GRACE for ""I hate everything about you."" Normaly when I get a compact disk it is for a specific song and then grow to like the others, but T. D. G. is different. Only songs 1-5 and 9 are good.After song 5 the ""album"" seems to just...fall apart. If you enjoy heavy stuff ,like SYSTEM OF A DOWN, this is not a compact disk for you...Also, I find this ""music"" quite depressing. DON'T GET IT!!...YOU'LL BE SAD YOU DID!!"
4,TDG is awesome!!!,"This band is very refreshing to listen to in the midst of a pop-punk wave and trust me, despite the fact that they signed on Jive, nothing about them is pop. They sound kind of like Smile Empty Soul so if you like that type of music, I definately suggest it. If nothing else, just listen and check them out. Even if they're music isn't really your style, they're lyrics are bound to hit you.Best songs: (I Hate) Everything About You, Drown, and Wake Up.Worst songs: Born Like This and Scared."
5,3DG's debut album,"This cd rocks!!! I love every song on it- not just the ones played on the radio. Sometimes when I buy cd's, I'm dissapointed because the cd has nothing good on it other than one or two songs. This cd isn't one of them. It is totally worth every penny!"
4,"Not ""One X"", But a good One....","I started with ""One X"" and worked back with this group. This CD has some good tracks but did not seem to grab me the way ""One X"" did, A good listen non the less though, GREAT sound, GREAT Group."
5,Pretty Darn Good,I call it as I see it and I thinks this album rocks. It is the typical modern rock sound that we have had for about 10 years now but it does rock and I did enjoy the album.
2,"good, but not great","I was not impressed with this. I haven't given it much play in my CD player, so maybe I'm wrong. After track five, it gets a little tiring. This is by no means worth the 11 bucks I paid for it."
3,Heard Better,"These guys are not bad, but could be better. The only real complaint that I have is that everything they do is far to repititous. They sing the same lyrics over and over again and play the same guitar over and over again. But overall it is still an okay album, but I would recommend something such as Anthrax's latest album ""We've Come For You All"" instead. Trust me it's very, very good."
5,Awesome,"From the first time I heard ""I Hate Everything about You"", I knew I had to get this cd. Let me tell you, I was not disappointed... Even though radio and TV unfortunately made these guys more 'pop' then they probably even desired, I would still recommend this to anyone who listens to metal or nu-metal. As with most of the other reviews, I would list the best tracks as #'s 1-4, but add #6, 10, and especially the emotionally gripping #11 'Take me under.'"
5,Amazing Grace,"When I first heard 'Home"" on FUSE, I thought this was just another small-town punk band for stoners.Then I heard 'Just Like You'.O.K., so they were growing on me.Finally, one day Iwas searching for one last cd to get the great deal onBMG's website.You know, buy 1 get x free.I decided to check this one out.I listened to a few songs on it, and i figured i'd get it.So my dad ordered it along with Chevelle: This Type of Thinking, and the Killers: Hot Fuss.At first I stayed with Home and Just Like You, since I knew I liked them.Now, though, I also like Scared and Let you down.I haven't listened to the other songs, but I highly recommend this cd and the ones I mentioned above (Chevelle and The Killers)."
3,Not the worst thing thats come out in the last 4 years,"Its not a the greatest Rock album ever! Its pretty much your typical new-aged angry-at-everything rock band of today. These three aren't the worst thing thats happened to music in the last 4 years but they don't match the amazing music of yesterday! So its your pretty typical, no-solo style of Rock muisc of today that you will even hear on (c)rap stations. So while it dosen't even hold a candle to acts like Black Sabbath and Led Zeppelin, its still a lot better than the schmuk thats out today. Although I don't think you should buy it. These guys will probably end up beeing just a one-two hit wonder."
3,Pretty good,"Ok I'm not a kid, Its just easier doing it this way.Overall, I think that the music is really good. The sound may be unoriginal, but I love listening to good solid metal anyway. However, the lyrics suck like no other. The whole hate thing is ok for one or two songs, but when every song on your album is about hating someone or something, you need counseling. So anyway, I try to listen to the music and not the words."
2,Please observe title of last track...,"Putting all lyrics aside (because, come on, isn't it obvious that he wrote all of them five minutes before entering the studio?), I really did like the first single, ""I Hate Everything About You."" But other than that, this CD is really nothing special. While it does make okay background noise and is significantly more listenable than, say, bands like Cradle of Filth or Cattle Decapitation, I have absolutely no problem with downloading the one song I like off of Kazaa. The whole album is really a waste of your hard-earned cash. You've heard a thousand other albums like this one, I promise."
1,"Oh, Three Days Grace, you're what the Spaniards call...","EL TERRIBLE! This album is a waste of time, money, and production. Their lyrics are simple and contradict each other on a constant, steady basis; Their rifts are basic and ripped off of every other MTV metal band out to date; They have no talent...None. From the goofy, big nosed singer, to the fat, mohawk-having guitarist. A band designed by simpletons, for simpletons, and played all over the radio so they make a little cash. Nothing more. Save your money for a good album and save your time for quality masturbation."
1,unbelievably overrated,"sorry to say, but i think these guys are just so god damn overrated. their songs are boring, repetetive, and just suck and no time was spent writing the lame lyrics. i had high hopes for these guys. do not waste your money. listen to some of their songs before you buy the CD and if you like them, then you like a crappy band."
1,Radio Disney with angst & a sneer,"The same pitch-normalized (computer-corrected) vocals, the same guitar tones, the same non-songs, the same silicone-injected choruses. Yawn; absolutely NO imagination or individual stamp here. My humble suggestions for actual songs and artistic points of view would start withDin of Ecstasy,Dirt,Euphoria MorningandBlack Sea. Even if these don't appeal to you, please keep looking. There are artists out there who have gone past the posturing to really communicate something to you."
4,Try This,ok this cd is great it has all the rock u need just listen and u wont b sry i wasnt anyways it was a great present and i kno if ya like rock u will likw this ENJOY
4,A fresh new band,"I found this album to be amazing. I bought it because i fell in love with their first single "" I hate everything about you"" and i'm very glad that i did because every song is just as good (or better) as that single. The lyrics are very direct and somewhat personnel, you can tell that the band has been through some hard times. The vocals are strong and edgy, a perfect blend of anger, sorrow, and sincerity. The entire album sort of explores the human mind and the aspects of this world and our relationships as people, taking you down into a dark soul that surges with beauty. It gets down into the dark places of life, the cold truth and reality of the world, while leaving you with a small sense of hope. it is music that you can listen to all the time, no matter what mood you happen to be in. They are amazing muscicians and the music is complex, with great riffs and melodies. I definatly recomend this c.d."
4,Great debut from hard rockers,"This is a very fresh sounding band. Great vocals and musicianship. They have an innate talent for writing catchy songs. Almost all of their songs could be singles. If you are sick of all the Nickelback clones out there, then try these guys out. Also, their sophomore set is even better."
3,"it's alright, but you might want to buy one-x instead","this cd does have a couple good songs (i hate everything about you,and home) while this cd is an ok cd i recommend you buy one-x because one-x has a lot better songs and their voices have matured.i am not saying you wont like this cd, i'm just saying one-x is a whole lot better.a good option is for you to listen to the 30 second clips on this cd and then listen to the clips on one-x and base your choice off of what you think sounds best and not go by what i think.i'm sure you will enjoy your purchase whether it be this or one-x i just hope three days grace gives us some more cds soon, to look forward to."
4,A Fairly Graceful Album,"Three Days Grace released a pretty fair sounding Rock album. Their self titled and debut record brought the band heavy attention by radio, music television stations, and soundtrack industries. The rock band even landed themselves a performing appearance in the film Raise Your Voice. Three Days Grace has the sound of must rock groups, mainly a IV-V-I chord progression using mostly power chords. Sometimes the group does throw in a vii chord, which does give the band's sound some flavor. THREE DAYS GRACE is repetitive at times, but after awhile, an acoustic track is thrown in, of a unique sound or electric guitars are used. For a record in its genre, THREE DAYS GRACE is a pretty good rockfest.Stand out tracks include:""Burn""""Just Like You""""I Hate Everything About You""Scared""""Wake Up"""
3,Good,"I enjoyed this CD a great deal. It's a good CD to have on hand when angry I guess. Anyways, at the start of the CD, about 6 songs are really catchy...but by the middle, it starts to kind of slow down...and some tracks start to sound like other ones. I noticed that I did have to play a few songs back to see what I was listening to. Also with the lyrics, they're simple....straight forward...maybe too much because they begin to repeat themselves a little. But overall I did enjoy this CD."
4,"They rock hard, but have teen angst lyrics.","Maybe this band is still living at home with thier mommies, because that's all there is to explain some of their lyrics. It's true, like another reviewer said, that the song Home has something like ""When you get home I'm already stoned, you turn off the TV and scream at me."" Boo hoo. Do your homework, you slacker.But, they do rock hard. They lyrics are not sappy lift me up or antichrist (which seem to be the two main genres lately).I'm glad I have this. Your milage may vary. Don't trust anyone's opinion on music."
5,TDG,The Three Days Grace cd is def. one the most awesome cds out there. I listen to the cd so much that i have gotten all of my friends to like them and i bought the cd for my friend for x-mas and she listens to it almost everyday and she normally doesnt even listen to that kind of music so yeah its def. awesome and they rock!!
5,Awesome!!!,this CD is a freaking awesome CD. i love 3DG and hope that they will continue to give us music to rock our souls!!! rock on guys!!
5,The Best,I just saw them in concert and this CD is AWESOME and the band is AMAZING I recommend Three Days Grace and Trapt to everyone!!!!!!!!!!
1,Song #12 says it all,"Wow this band is HORRIBLE. Could they be any more generic? Okay, their catchy, but their also lifeless, uninspired, and just... boring. Their like a mediocre version of Linkin Park who are pretty damn mediocre themselves. ""I Hate Everything About You"" made me crack up at the lyrics the first time I heard them because their so stupid, their not fun, not different, just cliche and pointless. Wanna know something odd? This band is on the same record label as NSync... bahahaha..."
2,THREE DAYS DISGRACE,"Whatever happened to GOOD ROCK with good vocalists that could actually sing, and good guitarists? It seems like every other rock band these days contains marble-mouthed, pseudo, angst-ridden vocals that are a clone between grunge rock and EMO garbage! 'Animal I Have Become' is one of their very few good songs, but that is on another 'album'. In the more musically creative 70's and 80's, crap like this would be laughed at by A&R execs, because it sounds so simplistic and basic! These guys sound like they are 12 or 13 year old amateurish kids, trying real hard to sound like a 'real rock band'. But then again, kids today have much lower standards, and are 'dumbed down' compared to previous generations. Perhaps the internet and video games have created a generation of passive, easy to please, uncritical zombies!"
1,No,I do not like this album one bit. I do not like this band one bit. But what I do like is bashing them to no end. That can be a lot of fun. You should try it sometime. Three Days Grace and their album are a classic example of radio trash that just won't stay in the garbage where it belongs. They'll eventually learn though that their music is not quality and is totally forgettable. People who like them are cuckoo for caca or maybe just caca for cuckoo. They also tend to have an awful lot of bowel movements.
1,(I hate) everything about this band,"This is a bad CD by a bad band. The problem with bands like Three Days Grace is it is so unbelievably unoriginal, you can't even tell them apart from other up and coming bands, Trapt for example. I turn on any modern rock station and i'm swamped with these bands who just make ""heart felt"" songs that are catchy and i can't stand it. I'll give them credit that its better then all the pop punk bullcrap, but its still not very good. People have to start looking past these bands, to other ones that have some originality or talent. These bands are just full of mediocre musicians and have songs that anyone can learn given a couple of hours. Whatever happened to a thing called a ""guitar solo""????"
1,Boring.ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ,"this bands music is so depressing I felt like slashing my own wrist. I would rather have a root canal then have to listen to this album. Seriously if their lives are this bad how do they get any work done in the studio.hmmm makes you wonder doesn't it. Just another prime example of re-hashed crap to sell to little whinny emo mallcore kids. I would not recommened buying this I would rather buy ABBA'S greatest hits, atleast that way I could have a really good laugh for about 45 minutes instead of wanting to swallow a bottle of pills after listening to these guys. Can you imagine being at a party or better yet at one of their shows? Do they hand out Prozac to all who enter."
1,For the first time in my life I envy the deaf,"I'm going to go out on a limb here and assume that their name ""Three Days Grace"" is referring to the amount of time they spent writing this album. In fact I think anyone who buys this album should get a ""three days grace"" period for returning it to the record store."
1,poor people,"It just seems like these babies hate everything and they're just gonna throw a tantrum and bang on their instruments for a while and have the lead *singer* ha...yell some generic pointless dreck about how the world is against him and he hates everything about his latest girlfriend turned him into a loser. And by girlfriend I mean the girl he's seen twice at a party, gotten the number of from a friend and been turned down for a date. Try something original for a change like Modest Mouse, Death Cab for Cutie, Five Iron Frenzy, Neutral Milk Hotel, Pink Floyd, The Beatles, Led Zeppelin...anything but this generic new (yes I can spell) metal crap. Also avoid Breaking Benjamen, Linkin Park, Limp Bizkit, and anything else that claims to be new (there it is again) metal. Now I love this part, it's where the mental midget pushes the not helpful button, thanks!Peace"
4,A great debut that sets the bar very high,"When I first heard 'I Hate Everything About You' I was hooked. Three Days Grace came off sounding so much like my favorite band at the time (Finger Eleven) that I almost instantly ordered their album. After recieving it in the mail I listened to every track with this intense air of unwavering attention and I became more and more pleased with my purchase as the tracks ticked away one by one. Songs like 'Burn' and the aforementioned really display the angust in this band, and tracks like 'Just Like You' and 'Home' served as ample single material, but it was 'Wake Up' that really grabbed my attention. As one of the more mellow tracks on the album it really showed the grace (no pun intended) this band has in the studio and delivered the most unexpected and overall entertaining track on the album. Great debut that left us all waiting for their sophemore album, which is just as great!"
2,If you've heard one song you've heard them all,"I heard the song, ""I Hate Everything About You"" on the radio and didn't like it at first, until I listened later and it grew on me. I thought I might actually like this band, whom I'd at first thought would be like all the other bands on modern rock radio, and I was right. I just do not latch on to any other tracks and even though I admit they are slightly better than most other cookie cutter rock bands, for me, they just don't do much, musically.I would suggest to anyone who feels the same way about modern rock radio and it's bands to just steer clear of this one."
5,Kickin Album,"3DG is one of the best bands out there. These guys have musical genus running through them. I listen to their CD all day, including while I am in class or studying (which by the way my grades have improved since)."
3,Are You People Retarded,"I can not believe how stupid people are saying things like ""Why does the lead singers voice sound the same on every song."" IT'S BECAUSE HE'S THE SAME FREAKIN GUY! You'd think it'd sound better if he threw his voice or somethin. Come on. Same goes for the guitar, it's the same guitar player. Now just for people who reviewed Three Days Grace, it goes for everyone who says the same crap about other bands. Amazon should put this up on every album review with guys who say that sh*t. By the way the albums pretty good. Especially ""Home""."
2,1 good song for 3 days grace,"They have one good song... I HATE EVERYTHING ABOUT YOU... but I HATE EVERYTHING ELSE ON THIS CD.... everything sounds the same and everything sounds like every other rock band trying to sound ""edgy"" sounds like a copy of nickelback and a mix in of system of a down. I don't know about you but I wouldn't waste 15 bucks on a cd with 1 good song your probably better off just buying a single from them."
3,3.5 stars maybe....,"So far I've listened to half of the CD and alot of it sounds the same....They are a hell of a lot better than Smile Empty Soul. This CD can be pretty heavy at times and it can sound alot like Nickelback. The lyrics aren't that great but its there first album so I'll give them some credit. I bought this CD because I wanted to listen to more of them , and so far its not a bad listen , but it could be better. I also bought it because I'm going to there show w/ Nickelback & Trapt. As time grows on I probably will raise my rating but for now it remains a 3.5....."
5,TDG rocks!!!,"Three days grace represent a unique style and i love it.Their whole cd is awsome but my favorite songs are ""take me under,"" and ""over rated."" We all will definatly be seeing even more of these guys in the new year, see you at the concert."
5,Enter a Canadian band worth listening to.,"After checking out a few tracks on this cd I have to say that this is finally a cd that I'm not going to grow tired of quickly. Finally Canada produced a trio that works well together and with a variety of their taste of music. With every note, lyric, or chord on this cd, Three Days Grace, takes there music up to a higher level. It's evident that this band had inspiration from others due to some of their stuff sounding like a blend of other bands, but Let me assure you 3DG isn't just another cookie cutter band that's gaining some attention. Whether it be with their radio friendly lyrics or just their attitude, watch for them to be tearing up the charts with more songs soon!"
1,crapsandwhich,"If you like your rock music boring and uninspired, then by all means, get ThreeDaysGrace, the worst, stupidest album ever released next to ""a hangover you don't deserve"" by Bowling for soup. Best listened to after a wild night of singing along with Avril Lavine and Jessica simpson at your local karaoke bar. FOr those of you looking for REAL talent, get something by Seether or Strata instead."
2,Get Real,"Well first off I'll address the guy who was going on about how three days grace gives canadian music a bad name. You may be write and I was hoping you were going to be some what intelligent but then saying that sum 41 are great and everything lost you all credibility points. The decent pop punk at best. You want to talk about good canadian music then mention names like hot hot heat, billy talent, alexisonfire, the new pornographers, peachers, godspeed black emperor, the stills. All these bands and artists push the boundaries and they are the bands we canadians should be proud of, these bands push the envelope and for a country known for regergatating american trends Canada has always had a steady hand of good indie talent."
5,~~~*~THE BEST CD EVER~*~~~,THIS HAS TO BE THE BEST CD EVER BECAUSE ALOT OF PEOPLE CAN RELATE TO THEIR SONGS....SO I THINK EVERYONE SHOULD BUY THIS FANTASTIC CD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
4,Three Days of Almost A Disgrace,"As Three Days Grace came out with I Hate Everything About You, I was interested to hear the rest of the album. But has it, it wasnt what I thought it would be. I thought it would be harder, and once I read the lyrics, I was a little dissapointed. The lyrics arent too great.1.Burn- It was a good starter song- 3/52.Just Like You- It was also a song, a lil hard- 4/53.I Hate...-Lyrics sucked, but catchy beat- 4/54.Home- shows a lil hardness, but alright- 4/55.Scared- Good beat, could have been harder- 3/56.Let You Down- Good mix of hard and slow- 4/57.Now or Never- Shows there hard side- 3/58.Born Like This- Great beat, good guitar- 4/59.Down- another good hard and slow song- 4/510.Wake Up- Strong guitar, good beat- 4/511.Take Me Under- Lyrics need some serious help, but good guitar- 3/512.Overrated- Seriously, get some better lyrics, and a lil bit harder and maybe they can get a 5/5- 3/5"
5,This band is AwEsOmE!!,"I heard this song at my boss's office one day, and it was AWESOME! As soon as I left work I went and bought the CD! Thats how good the CD is! I HIGHLY recommend you buy it!"
1,TDG,"Im sorry, but I just have no understanding of what people see in this band. I have listened to this album a few times, and every time it just seems more boring and shallow. They give you very straight forward and generic messages that other bands send better. The music has no meaning or emotion and really just feels like a band created by a record label for disenfranchised teens and the MTV ""rock"" sound."
5,Four Days Grace (not three alright!),"just kiddin about the title... THREE DAYS GRACE ROCKS!! I had this cd and listened to it whenever i had to do homework and crap and i got hooked on it. It has alot of good songs, not just a one great song cd ya know. The only bad thing about the cd was my sister stole it from me and i started to have hangovers.Buy this cd only if your sure it won't be taken away, or your ears will gladly teach you a lesson(or three)."
2,Three (...) Race,"I fought this cd good, wasn't. I fond myslef scary after hereing it. I felt sadly, about purchassing this mold of junkage, total bad. I don't thank any buy should it, but if wnat to you can buy it because you want to. I really hat thas cd vary, much I do. Do you?Well for startars. The song I hat evarethang aboot you. it showd be I HAT EVARETHANG... ABOOT... THES CD!!!!! It just isnt soundful, isnt it not.? for str. First of all,,, it not good to me ear or easry. IT is hard to lasten to withot laffing... ahhaha!111,.,! Bo you think it good? I feel sick on you if u think good this is. it not. no lvoe, (...)! DUD!"
4,Get over it,"I think if someone likes a band for their music whether its the lyrics or the music itself, then thats fine. Lets quit analyzing every band that puts something out there. We all know that everyone will not love them, so save it. I think they're great, so there. ;)"
3,'nuff said,"Quote from a previous review:""...u ppl claim that u dont like the cd cus its all about teen angst and anger towards prents n stuff and ok so be it but thats a good thing to write about...""That sums up the audience for this CD."
3,meh,"it's okay, but it's nothing new. i'd rather listen to smile empty soul. I can tolerate these guys for a while. If it came on the radio or it played at a party, i'd listen to it, but if i had teh choice, i'd get something else. also they're not metal. they're more post-grunge/nu metal. they do have a few good songs like just like you and home, but overall, they're just plain... hmm.. what's the word for it.... average."
4,"Straight up, honest rock","Three Days Grace achieves something most bands wished they could...they just play rock music. There's no effects, no turntables, no keyboards, no choirs in the background, just a guitar, a voicebox, a bass and some drums. Simple. That doesn't make them any less powerful to listen to.I haven't heard a rock mega-hit of such proportions since ""How You Remind Me"" by Nickelback came out. Now ""Just Like You"" is getting airplay as well. Both are incredible songs. The entire disc is great from beginning to end. No two songs sound the same, and it's obvious this band isn't trying to impress. They just wanna write music that's personal, and hope that it touches people. Buy this CD if you haven't already. If you're into Oleander, Nickelback, and Chevelle, you'll like these guys a lot."
5,3 Days Grace hits the rock scene hard,"Want some good hard rock? Here's your CD. If you're a fan of modern rock bands like Chevelle, Seether, Smile Empty Soul, etc. this is a band for you. They blend heavey distorted droptuned guitars with melodic vocals. The lyrics are also great, especially if youre down. While they are a little rough, Adam (guitarist) says that ""when you're happy you don't need a release."" Bottom line though, this CD rocks. There's not one song on it that I don't like, and the mix of some awesome heavy tracks(Home, Burn, Drown) combine with some lighter acousticy tracks(Wake Up). If you're a fan of modern heavy rock, BUY THIS CD!!!!!!!! And while you're at it, check these guys out on tour with staind and nickelback."
3,Similar to Finger Eleven in a number of ways...,"Which is a good thing, because Finger Eleven rocks! The guitar chord progressions and beats are very similar to F11 as are the vocals at times. The only difference is there is no 2nd guitarist. This cd is good and enjoyable to listen to, but I only give it 3 stars because it does have a little bit of cookie cutter status. Definitely not groundbreaking rock (when I compare it F11, it sounds most like ""Tip,"" which came out in 1998...it's now 2003) but that doesn't mean it's not worth listening to. The guitar beats are very catchy...if this CD had a little bit more variety, it would get 4 or 5 stars. Still worth the purchase.It's funny, when I play my guitar along with these songs, I find myself playing them in that robot style like James Black (F11)."
5,Holy talitos! It's good.,"The first song is alittle slow getting started but after that it is glorious. One by one the songs just keep getting better. Three Days Grace made an awesome cd, it's defiantly a must have."
5,3DG Rocks,"I Love listening to Adam with his emotional filled voice that puts you right there with him. like in ""I hate everything about you"" i think everyone has experienced that feeling of love/hate. There music is total energy for the here and now."
3,So-So,"ok, so i'm not really under 13...i just dont feel like making an account.However..This music is just ok. It's not really anything special. Yes, it isn't metal, but that's really not any reason not to listen to it, unless you're like...really close minded and only listen to metal.However, there is much worse garbage out there, and this isn't neccesarily bad, it's just not the best out there. I reccomend that you give it a chance, because you make like it. It get's boring after a while, but with music, you always come back and listen to it after a few months.On another note, the songs may sound like ....oh yeah only 3 chords...that's horrible. but even if there are 3 chords, from my own experience, even those three chords can make everything difficult. writing songs is hard. so, you need to give them some credit."
4,a great album produced from a rookie band,"i cant give this cd a 5 cause it aint a masterpiece but its pretty close. the best songs are i hate everything about u, home, scared, and drown. i havent heard much of the other tracks but the way these songs are goin i dont have a doubt that theyre just as good. i cant wait for this bands next album and u can guarentee ill buy it."
2,Catchy tunes but...,"Musically I think this is actually a pretty good CD. The music grabs you and makes you want to listen...good musical hooks, grinding guitars, good vocals, good drumming...it's the repetitive and shallow lyrics that makes you want to throw the CD out the window.I think another reviewer nailed it when he mentioned that he thought this band was just thrown together by the record label to pick the pockets of what he described as ""disenfranchised youth"". I believe it. Look at the insert to find out who wrote the songs. They were all written by the CD's producer.To sum things up...musically, I would give this CD a 3.5 it's not the most original thing I've ever heard but it's catchy. It's the lyrics that ruin it for me...they are just so mediocre and uninspiring I can't give it above a 2. So, if you can tune out the lyrics and ignore the fact that this band is just a record company's puppet you'll probably like the CD, otherwise find something else."
1,Musical equivalent of white label beer.,"Is it just me, or does ALL of this sound the same? Guitars cranked loud to sound ""hardcore"", same dumbass marblemouthed moron screaming ""I love you my life is crap i hate you pain surrounds me I'm gonna do drugs to act tough"". Who needs finesse, really? These guys don't. I mean, Jesus, Radiohead comes across tougher than these clowns. Of course, if you're into ultra-generic post-alternative/post-nu metal ""rawk"", this is your fix right here."
2,A waste of $13.99,"yesterday i bought this cd.. it really wasnt worth it. i had only heard ""i hate everything about you"" and ""just like you"" so little did i know that every single song on the cd would be based on the same thing- hating someone (most likely parents).. and being someone who doesnt hate their parents, i find it very hard to relate to this album. its got a lot of energy and a heavy guitar part which is why i gave it 2/5.. i'd recommend trapt or hoobastank over these guys."
3,needs more creativity in songwriting,aggressive style but no real depth to song stucture... lead guitar break missing in most material....also needs to expand content lyrically.... 3 on a 5 scale rating
5,Great CD,This was worth my money to get Three days Grace is the best new band now. Its the kinda of music we should all listen to and is worth time to listen. There lyrics are just great and the way they make the sound are great to this was a great cd and i hope for more to come.
3,eh..,Decent album. I like their single but the rest of the album seems to sound like its the same song. Nothing special.
2,not as expected,"A bit too pop, expected more. A few of the songs work well but many of the others are too routine."
5,wonderful music,"What a great album. Mostly melancholic but very beautiful. One song is better than the other. It's very refreshing to hear this melodic music in French (it sounds so much deeper this way). Natasha's voice is incomparable, equally gentle, emotional and intense."
3,exagerating civil society in Egypt,"This is an average, not too exceptional book with a lot of leitmotifs and common themes. It's not a bad resource to use while writing a paper, but you won't find any revolutionary ideas here. I found reading it to be a dreary bore and frustrated by what seemed like a forced effort to name the Muslim Brotherhood as the vanguard of civil society in Egypt. Being that civil society is a popular catch word in Middle East Studies these days, it is only natural that scholars come along and try to equate civil society with the non-violent Islamist violence. The problem is that the Brotherhood has never been a paragon of tolerance, democracy and pluralism--just look at how the organization is run. Moreover, I found it shocking that the work failed to discuss the Center Party despite the amount of time discussing the Muslim Brotherhood."
4,big noize,"is what i like and what i hear when i listen to this one and its again a classic slade album for me. if you like rogues gallery you will like this one, not as strong as rogues overall but still lots of fun."
2,another CD with little relation to the film,"Time was, the recording from a film consisted of the music track of the actual film. Now, producers think it has to be its own piece. And in this case (as another reviewer has noted) it doesn't hold together. People trying to find a piece of music they particularly liked in the documentary may luck out and get it. But the largest portion of the CD just consists in the documentary's (un)original, and insipid, compositions by Brian Keane."
2,"Looks great but its sound is no so great, the shoulder-rest is terrible, and weights a lot","The Fender has a hollow body that produces a tunnel-like sound and it's sound is not the greatest.It's really over priced. This violin is a good value if you pay no more than 400-500 bucks.It looks beautiful tho, and that's so misleading!The name Fender is misleading as well, it's a Korean violin with a Fengling or one of those Korean pickups, and weighs way too much."
4,Uma banda sensacional !,"O livro foi muito bem escrito e produzido com muito bom gosto, fazendo com que qualquer f dos caras, ficassem super preso ao livro, bem vou indo ... pegar umas ondas na prainha !! VALEU BROTHERS. Jonh Jr."
5,the most sensational airplane serial ever made!,"Don't miss this!This the best oldie movie I have ever seen! The special effects, in crisp black and white, were flawless, not ""hokey"" like most action movies of the period. When I watch this movie I feel that I'm ""there"" - I love the big cars,the street scenes, machines, fire trucks, ambulances, ships, planes and the fashions!Donald Woods is as dashing a hero as Erroll Flynn and Kathyrn Adams is as sweet as your little sister. The bad guys are trying to kill them and steal the protype of the Air Forces military plane.There's a lot of fistfights, car chases, crashes, and we enjoy long displays of flying stunts (small propeller planes)in every segment of the serial. The characters are all very close, like a family and their is a constant light-heartedness and implied romances. Each part ends in a disaster (or ""cliff-hanger"" to keep your interest."
3,fun to watch,"As a kid, my mother would give me 25 cents, thats right a quarter, every Saturday.I would go downtown to the theater, where on Saturday, there would be two full feature films, six to twelve cartoons, and a drawing during the intermission, for tickets, box of suckers, etc. And then the weekly serial. Flash Gordon was always the favorite. What was also good, I could stay in the theater into the evening and watch the movies again. They would not show as many cartons.Anyway, these serials are fun to watch. I only gave three stars as I have some Charlie Chan that werere-mastered and look better than what remember as a kid. I would be nice to have these re-mastered as there are some dark areas that you cannot see the actors. But they are still fun to watch. If you are looking for serous drama, forget it, these are corny, fun, and watch the fights, nine times out of ten, the hats the men are wearing stay on. The 20's through the 50's, men wore hats, ladies wore gloves.Have fun watching."
3,Sky Raiders,"I remember this serial on television, when I was just a boy, but barely remember it. All my life I seemed to recall biplanes capable of using tail-mounted flame throwers to ignite other aircraft and things on the ground...and the memories were accurate. For those who like cheeply made serials in which airplanes fly 12-foot circles low in the sky, the good guy(s) repeatedly get knocked on their cans when they take on bad guys who always outnumber the good guy(s), and who, in brawls of all types manage to keep their hats on (and their suits and ties just dandy), you might enjoy Sky Raiders. You might enjoy it a lot more if you make popcorn and watch the episodes with, say, a couple six-year-olds."
1,disapointing,"Like almost all of the Saturday afternoon, serials it failed the test of time badly. I'm glad they inspired George Lucas and Steven Speilberg to grow into the great filmakers they are. Unfortunately, they were not worth transfering to dvd. I'm stuck with them. Maybe I can stick someone with them as gifts."
3,"Not bad dryer, especially when all they make are ionics","I am super picky about my hair dryers. And while this is not the best one I've ever had (my favorite was an 1875 watt Helen of Troy Professional that died several years ago), it's not bad. Unfortunately, in this day and age, the only dryers I can seem to find are ionic ones. For me ionic dryers = flat hair. So, with the choices so limited, this dryer is decent. I wish it had slow fan speed with high heat, but I can't be too choosy at this point."
2,Not good,This product is not good. When I first use this blow dryer it worked very well but after six months It stopped working. I plugged it in and it wasn't blowing but smelled like something was burning. I would not recommend this product.
4,Shorted out after 4 years 4 months.,"I purchased this Blackbird in December of 2006 and now in April of 2011 smoke started coming out of the on-off switch, so I got a good 4 years out of it.In this day and age when this product like others offer no warranty time at all I quess thats pretty good."
1,BUMMER,"I'm sure this hair dryer could have been great. I loved my Yellowbird but unfortunately, this Blackbird would not power on. The original hair dryer got to me in a matter of days but the replacement was going to weeks so I had to cancel it and get a refund. Bummer!"
3,Worked well until it died,"After my old hair dryer died, I decided to get this one because my mom has it. I had it for only two or three months before it started to make rattling noises when I used it. I would hit it, and the rattling would lessen. However, after a short while of this happening, I was drying my hair and it started to smell smoky. I decided to give up on it before it caught fire or something.If my mom didn't have the same one that has been working perfectly fine for over a year, I would have rated this one star."
4,Hair Dryer,"I bought this hair dryer for my father, I needed something super powerful, and not too girlie. It is perfect you could almost use this thing to power a sailboat! but it is kind of big and heavy."
2,Not the quality I expected,"My wife has had Conair hair dryers in the past that have lasted many years. Old one finally died. Wanted the same pistol grip style so bought the Blackbird Pro, thinking it would last even longer. This one only lasted 19 months before the bearings went out and I am told by Conair it only has a 12 month warranty. Paid $30 for it, but was able to buy a different cheaper model at WalMart for $17 with a 24 month warranty. Go figure."
4,Good Dryer But Slighty Uncomfortable,"Pros:1. Lots of power2. Dries hair quickly3. Well built4. Long cordCons:1. Uncomfortable to hold2. Somewhat ackward temp switchesIf you ""live and die"" by your hair dryer, this may be a bit taxing after a long days work. But a true performer! Kind of miss the ""cool shot"" button of my last dryer..."
4,Nice hair dryer,"This is a nice hair dryer. It's up there with some of the $100 dryers I have purchased. It isn't whisper quiet, but it dries hair fairly quickly. I love that it has four different heat settings. I have long, super thick hair, so I need a strong dryer, and this definitely does the job."
2,Not Professional Quality,"Our previous dryer lasted about 15 years before the bearings went out. We have a wall mounted holder for the dryer that requires a more narrow 2"" diameter barrel, rather than the short - fat snouts popular now. I chose the ConAir Pro Blackbird mainly for its ability to fit our holder. It worked fine for the first 3 months, then the high speed setting quit, and we had a single speed with hot or cold air dryer. Less than a year from the purchase date the power on/off switch now jams in the on position, requiring the unit to be unplugged to shut it off. It's now in the trash. I expected much better service from a ""Professional"" dryer. Primarily, one person uses this dryer once a day; hardly a taxing load for any blow dryer. Also of note is that this machine carries no safety agency compliance labeling such as UL or CSA, which may have performance criteria for operator switches."
3,Quite decent,"I bought this cologne on a whim. It doesn't smell as I had imagined (eg. raw vanilla), but rather, has a musky fragrance. My girlfriend told me that I smell like a car freshener, so I trust there is a hint of vanilla hiding in there somewhere. For $10, it's not bad. However, I think I'll stick with the bvlgari blv for the most part when I want to smell like a vanilla bean."
1,wrong price?,"When I purchased Raw Vanilla by Coty it was $17.81. When I received it the item price says $32.50, total price $32.50. I have double checked this price, it is still listed as $17.81. I would appreciate it if someone could explain this price change!Susan Castleberry"
1,"old, irrelevant, not creative, third-rate talent","Doonesbury is at least 20 years past its prime now, not a bit creative now and trys to get attention with shock-value, but even that isn't working anymore. Trudeau has run out of ideas, barely focuses on the characters, and no longer seems to remember what the strip is about. Trudeau has an easy enough job now, he watches Leno or Letterman, he steals one of their jokes, he weaves it into his strip 2 days later and is unable to make the joke work. The graphics are terrible and he goes for low-blows now of people just for shock-value. Peanuts, Blondie, Dilbert, even Family Circus are all most creative than Doonesbury. Peanuts will be around forever, Doonesbury has about a 48-hours shelf life, the second Trudeau dies, nobody will even remember Doonesbury."
1,Degrades sound quality,I'll keep it short.1) Plugged headphones into laptop2) Listened to music3) Sounded BAD@$$4) Plugged laptop into line level input on Rolls Amp5) Plugged headphones into rolls6) listened to same material7) Sound Like: Lost low end response and signal degradation (distortion)<==== I'm an audio engineer and I've been in the business for quite a while. I know enough about gain structure to know that i was not driving the rolls input too hard. This headphone amp is not right for you if you're looking for a quality reference signal in your headphones.
5,Toshiba digital is excellent,"I purchased this TOshiba digital camera because Consumer Reports rated it number one for photo quality in its class of 2.0 - 2.9 megapixels. While I am not a professional photographer, my film needs would never exceed photo quality of a higher caliber, and I am immensely pleased with this product. The design of the camera is not wholly ideal to me, but the photo quality is superb, and that is what matters most to me."
2,"camera's fine, but interface terrible","I like this camera. the pictures are great. Just make sure that you use the USB, and don't use Flashpath to get the pictures to your computer. I did the latter for a while, and it's really bad. And the USB only works sporadically. What use are great pictures if you can't get them off your camera? And by all means use rechargeable batteries. The thing is a total battery hog. That said, the pictures are great."
4,Attitude vs. Vocal Ability,"Anybody buying a Nancy Sinatra CD for her vocal abilty will be sorely dissapointed. All you have to do is listen to her compellingly bad cover duet with Lee Hazlewood of ""Love Is Strange"". One wonders the looks on the face of people listening to the final product in the studio. Did they look at her and say, ""Wow Nancy, that was great!""? Sometimes her voice is flatter then a watered-down pancake. Nancy Sinatra is all about attitude, and when she hits her mark, she does it dead on with her trademark vocal sneer/growl. Don't get me wrong, this is a groovy little compilation and Nancy deserves her place in the 'Cool Hall of Fame.' She was the first pop-star two have two-toned hair! I've always loved her cover of ""Daytripper"", and that Zodiac song is really fun too. There is only one Nancy Sinatra and I'm really glad to see her songs and videos being reissued. So, if you really want to groove, this CD is a must-have!"
2,Written for the young reader of the past.,"The book is an interesting example of a genre which may now be obsolete. It was written for the young reader, although I doubt that the 90's youngster would find it holding. I enjoyed it as a visit to a distant past."
4,"Mary, Queen of Scots","Mary, Queen of Scots, is living in France with her four friends, the Marys. I liked this book but I liked the Marie Antoinette one. I still have to buy the Sondok one!!!"
2,Good FICTION book,"THis book is a good read. I've found though that many books in this series are incomplete. They fail to metion any parts of their deaths. I for one don't like this. In History Mary Queen of Scots was killed by her cousin Elizabeth I of England. I also noticed that in the last grand duchess, they again failed to show why she ended up as the last grand duchess. I enjoyed reading this book. In reality, the book isn't a history lesson and shouldn't be read as such. Finally, it is an incomplete account based on a certain author's view."
4,"Mary ,Bloody Mary",I haven't read the epilogue but I think some info is left out. She killed many people. She was Bloody Mary! Elizebeth 1 overthrew her for that reason!
2,Not appropriate for age group,"I read this book because I had read other Royal Diaries, but this book had many inappropriate mentions.For example, when the Marys' set out to catch the person who looked in Mary's things, they used purple staining powder. Several days later, after a ball, they found the culprit, and then his purple handprints on Mary Livingston's breast. Mary went to tell Queen Catherine, who also had purple hands, said,""I found purple handprints on Mary's face and breast.Then, after that the King asked Mary if the other Mary had in any way lost her honor. I know what that means, but maybe a little eight year old reading this might not. How do you explain that to a child?Also, the plot itself was uninteresting. After 1 year, it felt like nothing had happened at all. It was just a series of events.Save your time and don't read this book."
1,book for toddlers!,"Got this for my 6 year old grandson. And I think I was more disappointed than he was. I expected more than just pictures with one word on a page! This was a book maybe to share with a toddler, but no kids in Kindgergarten will be very impressed. Think twice before you buy it1"
2,Meh,This book is ok but doesn't talk about several things that I thought were important to discuss with a toddler before going on a plane. Airport security and tiny airport bathrooms aren't talked about at all.
4,little bit thin but great if you need to get ready for long trip,kids can learn about planes and airport and be little bit more familiar with the whole process of flying. Will keep this one around for the next trip on board of airplane :)
5,Perfect!,"I bought this book for a little boy who is almost 2 and has never been to the airport. It is perfect in every way. It guides the reader through each step of air travel, from arrival at the airport to takeoff. It is very factual, which is the type of book that toddlers understand. They do not like imaginative thinking at this age. I really appreciate the page where the passengers put on their seatbelts. I found this was a nice way to talk about difficulties getting into the car seat. The pictures are very detailed, the phrases are short and succint, and the length of the book is just right. All of these things are important when choosing a book for a toddler or preschooler who does not have a fully developed attention span. It has quickly become one of our favorite books.(side note for a toddler-I bought this book with the fisher price little people airport toy. They were both a big hit and nice companion pieces)"
3,Better Books Available,"This book does contain all the information a preschooler needs to understand the airport and traveling process. That being said, there are other books available that do it in a more entertaining fashion. I recommend ""Amazing Airplanes"" by Tony Mitton and Ant Parker."
5,Great trip preparation,"This book worked out great for us in preparation for my daughter's first plane trip. She was 18 months at the time.We read it a few times and talked about all the different things that happen at airports and on planes. Our traveling went so well I couldn't believe it. We watched through the airport window excitedly while our plane pulled up to the gate, loaded onto the plane with no hassle, and then found our seats with lots of happy smiles. Before take-off she was so excited that she was bouncing on the seat saying "" I plane! I plane!"" Then she snuggled into my wrap and fell asleep for the whole trip... No fear, no worries.I recommend this book to anyone planning to take their toddler on a plane."
5,Good,Good book. Very entertaining and educational. I wish it were smaller or a board book. It is a very large book.
5,Great for reducing children's fears of air travel!,"I recommend this book to anyone traveling by air with children under 5. The illustrations and simple, age appropriate language completely explain the entire process of air travel to small children, from arrival at the airport to the actual flight. My 20 month old daughter recognized many scenes from the book at the airport. Because she knew what to expect, her fears were completely calmed, even during the loud take-offs and landings."
5,Excellent for toddlers,"My daughter, now 23 months, has loved this book since she was 14 months old. This book has made her even more fascinated with airplanes. When she sees an airplane she always points it out and asks to go on an airplane. She asks for us to read this book daily (my husband and I have it memorized). The illustrations are wonderfully bright in color. The text is simple but written well for young children to understand the pictures. This is one book I don't mind reading everyday!"
4,A Great Book for Introducing Toddlers to the Rhythm of an Airport,"If Donald Crews'Flyingprovides a birds-eye view of the distance an airplane covers, Airport captures the human processes that go into an airplane trip. In Barton's concise, well-crafted style, he describes the passengers' arrival at the airport, then their waiting while luggage is loaded and the plane is fueled. He moves on to boarding, flight preparation in the cockpit, clearance from the control tower, safety instruction for the passengers, taxiing, and takeoff.The illustrations are deceptively simple, paring each scene down to its most essential parts, but retaining enough detail to provide plenty of interest. Throughout the book, Barton captures the rhythm of life in an airport. This is an excellent book for preparing young children for their first airplane ride, or simply helping them understand an important part of modern society."
5,Perfect preparation for air travel,"We acquired this book for our 1.5 year old daughter and read it to her prior to a recent flight. She adores the book and requests it be read to her over and over again. Not only did it seem to help her make sense of her airport experiences, she has also started noticing and pointing out planes in the sky when we are outside. My only criticism is minor...that the book needs to be updated because it uses the word ""stewardess."""
5,Very interesting read,"Exit to Freedom is a ""very well written"" account of Calvin Johnson's imprisonment for a crime he didn't commit and his 16+ year journey to being released. It is an eye-opening accounting of the legal system, its many failures and the challenges faced by individuals (and their family, loved-ones, and friends) in getting good representation especially for people of modest means or a racial minority."
5,Totally Awesome & Inspiring!,"""Exit to Freedom"" is by far one of the best books I've read! The authors (Calvin Johnson & Greg Hampikian) did an outstanding job taking us through the sixteen painful years Calvin experienced in jail for crimes he did not commit.The transformation of starting out extremely angry and bitter to learning to accept God's guidance and love is clearly illustrated throughout the book.I highly recommend this book to everyone. Calvin Johnson's willingness to forgive those who wronged him is a lesson we can practice in our daily lives.There are so many others like Calvin Johnson locked up for crimes they did not commit. I applaud the Innocence Project and other organizations willing to ""right"" a terrible ""wong"".I just purchased two more copies for gifts. Best wishes and blessings to the Johnson family."
4,"Touching, interesting, and honest","Calvin C. Johnson Junior's story shines a spotlight on the issues within the American criminal justice system, yet is story is also one of self-discovery. Together Johnson and Dr. Greg Hampikian write of a travesty with honesty and integrity. Even though this story has a happy ending, don't expect it to read like a novel. It deals with heavy topics that are handled without ever forgetting there are real people involved. The authors don't attempt to paint Johnson as a hero or a victim. They portray him as a human complete with flaws. At time he will infuriate you and at others touch your heart deeply. Telling someone's truth as it really was is a difficult job, but Johnson and Hampikian shine in Exit to Freedom."
5,Necessary Reading,"In literary terms, it might be easy to smirk at some of the posturing taken by Mr. Johnson in the story. Reflections on self and faith often seem self-serving. However, under the extraordinary fate of his circumstance, 16-plus years in prison for a brutal crime he did not commit, and for a crime he was exonerated for from the get-go that seemed to dog his life in the criminal justice system, his observations are both believable as well as commanding of respect. The writing is exemplary, but it's the story that is important. This is necessary reading regardless of your views on criminal justice. And beyond that, a reader feels compelled to shed tears for Mr. Johnson even if he does not expect them. More importantly, closing the last page, it becomes impossible not to wish constant happiness in his life to atone for the wrongs done to him, if such atonement could be possible."
5,The best car cassette adapter for ipod,I read the reviews before and bought the Sony adapter and they were right. This works GREAT!
2,It charges,"I bought the PowerJolt to charge both my iTrip (Nano 2g version) and my Razr. Unfortunately, it will not charge the Razr even though it too has a mini usb.The 2 star rating is due to a high pitched buzz that plays along with my music whenever it is plugged in. It's almost unnoticeable, but once you do notice it, it is impossible to not hear."
4,Griffin Charger Great w/ Griffin iTrip,"The Griffin 9749-PJBLK PowerJolt Auto Charger is a great product. What makes it a must is its compatibility with the Griffin iTrip FM Transmitter with LCD and Dock Connector for iPod, because can have the Griffin iTrip plugged into your iPod and transmitting to your car's stereo and be charging your iPod w/ the PowerJolt Auto Charger plugged into the transmitter. It works great and charges my iPod more quickly than when my iPod is connected to my home computer."
5,Works like it should - no problems!,"It looks good, charges an iPod, and I haven't noticed any whining/interference as other people have.If I had to change something it would be the cord coming out at a right angle to the DC plug, so it isn't so long, because before I modified it it wouldn't fit in the console of my car. But that shouldn't be a problem for most people."
5,Tristemente Impresionante,"Es increible la forma en el autor describe una realidad contemporanea, donde el medio ambiente esta desecho y los seres humanos se enfrascan en una lucha por la supervivencia."
2,solar is what you make it,"I run my entire home on solar energy. U use passive solar like shade, solar thermal like my solar hot water system and active solar PV electric panels. I even get credit back from my utility each month.This author doesn't want to learn how to use all the forms of solar. He is just an engineer stuck on one point. He should add up all the incentive we now pay to big oil, fossil fuel and nuclear. Take all that away and solar is pure gold. It uses not water, creates no pollution and puts out the most during the peak hours of the day when we use it the most.He needs to remove his pocket protector and get all the facts."
1,Ever heard of Net-ZERO?,"Don't tell the Germans or the Japanese that solar is a fraud. They would have to roll-back a multi-billion dollar solar industry and pay more for dirty coal/oil/nuclear energy. Don't tell the university teams who build NET-ZERO energy homes for display every 2 years for the DOE Solar Decathlon competition that the buildings they design should actually just use non-renewable energy instead of making as much or more energy than they consume. Dr. Hayden just hasn't really done all of his homework. Where is his head at? It's true, solar energy does not work where the sun don't shine!"
1,don't bother,"The Solar Fraud: Why Solar Energy Won't Run the World, Second EditionI found this book to be an utter triple waste. A waste of money buying it; a waste of time reading it; and waste of paper (and trees) printing it. Mr. Hayden offers nothing but quibbling, carping, and criticism; no valid solutions whatsoever for the energy predicament in which we find ourselves. If I could give this book zero stars, or a negative number of them, I would."
2,some truth mixed in with a jumble of misleading statements,"page 10 is misleading, comparing the 6% output of solar power generation versus the predicted 36% of 2000 projection of ""soft energy paths"". So the author is equating all soft energies with just solar. Amory Lovins soft energy paths wasn't just talking about solar, it was talking about all soft energies (all different types of renewables AND co-generation!) in that 36%, which turned out to be very close to projection. This is an example of the lack of thoroughness, or possibly, intentional misleading by the author.I agree that solar is an expensive technology for the efficiency rates it achieves, but consider this: If we had the same subsidies in renewable technologies as coal and oil do, how much better would they be now? Seems like coal and oil are the only ones that don't play by the rules of the ""free market"" w/o help, especially if you take into account the indirect subsidies of needing to protect pipelines or go to war."
2,Deeply flawed arguments,"If there is any scientific consensus regarding solar, it is that it is expensive now but that it will once be our most important source of energy (unless fusion or some yet to be discovered source of energy takes off).The debate is more a question of WHEN and in this debate this ""professor"" is certainly not what you would call a ""peer reviewed resource"".If you are afraid to believe in the promise of Solar and want some thorough but not too technical scientific credentials of the highest order I would direct you to online lectures of nobel prize winning Richard Smalley and for even harder data professor Nathan Lewis.And about the cost: the question is again WHEN the cost will become competitive. Hardly any researcher in the field questions the assumption that it will be once be cheaper that coal. The question is: does it take untill 2020 or does it take untill 2100. Research for yourself and be pleasantly surprised!"
2,Out of date and Out of touch,"What this book proves is that marketing is more powerful than product. The author definitely has a good grasp of technical and theoretical concepts. But, he also spouts his assumptions as cast in stone. Having lived off-grid and been involved in green and net-zero projects for over 20 years...far too much of the authors material is out of date or off-base. Yes, I'm biased..but also a realist. If you want more evidence to keep the world on the path of addiction to dirty polluting and unsustainable energies...buy the book. Otherwise, don't waste your time or cash."
1,Professor????? ....... Fool!,"The amount of solar radiation that reaches us is equal to 10 000 times the annual global energy consumption. On average, 1 700 kWh per square meter is insolated every year.Even assuming terrible efficiency in conversion there is more energy than we could ever need.The fossil fuels that we are burning today are the results of plant and animal matter that ultimately got their energy from the sun.Using finite resources makes no sense.This is typical of the arrogant attitude in the U.S. towards energy."
4,Good buy for any Slick Rick fan,"While it isn't on the same level as ""The Great Adventures..."" or ""The Art of Storytelling"", Rick still manages to drop some great tracks on this LP. ""Behind Bars"" (both the original and Dum Ditty Dum remix f/Warren G), ""Sittin' In My Car"", and ""A Love That's True (Part One)"" are some of Rick's best songs, combining all the traits that make him great: story telling, humor, nice beats (especially ""Sittin' In My Car"", which also features beatboxing by Doug E. Fresh), and an underlying message. The main weakness of this CD is that it only has eleven tracks, a couple of which are just filler. Still, the album is definetly worth buying if you are a fan of Slick Rick's music."
5,Very good,"A MUST for serious Bible study. The book was old; but unused and in good condition, so we feel blessed to have it."
1,e-reads edition is execrable,"This review deals only with the quality of this edition, not with the story as such. It appears this edition was produced by an optical scan of an earlier edition, with no evidence that the result was proofread. There are about four 'typos' per page, enough to distract from the story. Some are easy to puzzle out ('fight' instead of 'right'); others less so.I'll be looking at all my future purchases carefully to make sure they are not e-reads editions."
4,Great but slightly flawed,"This is a great..no, a FANTASTIC story, with a deep philosophical issue behind its cosmic disaster theme: the conflict between any society's quest for perfection, and the individual's need to do things..differently.The book is a tad long; way too many characters are introduced, and too much time is spent on the effects on Earth by the Wanderer. Some editing, and this would have earned 5 stars.Storywise, it IS 5 stars.By the way, check out his ghost novel Our Lady of Darkness. More great stuff"
3,The first half of Wanderer is the reason its out-of-print,"This is the second book by Leiber to win hugo award. The plot is the same as in Clarke's Rendezvous with Rama. Alien spaceship arrives, eats the moon and that causes major earthquakes and destruction on Earth. Finally the question being answered: we are not alone. However, the revealing of the truth, why aliens came to our system is frightening, because it has nothing to do with human species, who aliens at first do not even recognize as intellegent beings. They opinions of humans is the same as what we think of ants. Now to the bad part. The first 150 out of 300 pages book are badly written. It feels like it was translated in Engish from a different language by amateur translator. The writing is chaotic, ridiculous at times ( the whole Moon episode), etc. What win this book the award was the great second half of the book and the idea within."
1,"great concept, badly performed","Fritz Leiber's notion of a planet-sized visitor (the ""Wanderer"") to the Earth had huge potential but falls flat. The book begins by introducing about 10 mostly unrelated stories about various people reacting to the Wanderer's appearance. I assumed at some points there stories would intersect in a larger plot, but no such luck. Each little plot just spins along by itself, and most of them don't attract the least bit of interest or have any larger impact beyond some random individual's reaction to a world-wide catastrophe.At one point, one of the characters jokes that science fiction is trivial because it deals with ""phenomena rather than people."" On the contrary, only bad science fiction deals with phenomena. Great science fiction deals with people, with the phenomena just forming a backdrop against which the human condition can be revealed in an interesting way. The Wanderer doesn't even come close.Also, the Kindle version is badly in need of a copy editor."
3,Special Education Law with Cases,"I am impressed with this book and am considering using it as a text book for my legal issues in special education course. The book serves to personalize the abstract concepts of the law and allows individuals to connect concepts with scenarios. The breakout of the various chapters and case studies reflects those issues of special education law that are critical to the professional practice of teachers. The one drawback to the book is that each of the case study chapters is based on a subject of law, but the subject is not presented. It remains up to the reader to determine the concept of law from the interpretation of the case. All-in-all I found this book to present an insightful and thoughtful approach to common issues of special education that are directly impacted by the process of law."
4,Special Education Law book,Good book. I bought the book for a mandatory class read. It's actually really interesting and worth the read.
3,Garmin Forerunner 301,"I bought my forerunner slightly used about 4 months ago. For someone who is just getting started with a good fitness routine this product should prove to be beneficial. Depending on where I am it can easily interface with my desktop PC or my MAC laptop...definitely a plus. I can only think of two draw-backs and those are that it is not water-resistant, therefore no swimming with it and it may, at times take 5-10 minutes to lock in on satellites. Other than that I am quite pleased with it."
1,Terrible picture,This is probably thr worst DVD player that I have ever owned.It looks cheap and performs cheap.
3,Pages too thin,"This is a review about the quality of the physical book, not the text.The pages are very thin, almost see through. If you encourage your kids to highlight significant passages, this edition is not a good choice. I purchased it for a student, and I don't think it's going to last more than a year, if that. I personally feel that a student bible should be a tough, companion book that can endure a camping trip and riding to and fro in a school backpack. This is a neat bible; too bad it's not a bit tougher."
2,"Good Bible, too much politics","Why are there pages after pages highlighting ""African Americans,"" ""Asian Americans,"" and ""Native Americans""? When did the Catholic Church decide to be politically correct and make sure all these groups stand out and be inserted artificially? I have nothing against them. I just wonder what prompted the insertion of a polytheistic culture into the Catholic bible. Can't we all discuss the bible without labeling each other ""this American"" and ""that American."" I'm Irish -- a group highly persecuted 19th-early 20th century. I believe they also have something to do with Catholicism... yet I find no mention of this group or many others. The other reviews point out the good aspects of this bible. So I will not reiterate them here. There were many of course. But there are not enough to prompt me to support this mockery."
1,item still not received 1 month later,ordered one small book only 20/4/2012 still not received 29/5/2012. Not very happy since I was charged for it the day I purchased it.
3,This is the NRSV.,"This is the New Revised Standard Version, which the Holy See does not allow for use in the liturgy. Catholics wanting to use approved translations should consider the New American Bible-- St. Joseph Ed. and the New Jerusalem Bible-- Regular Ed., both of which include copious footnotes and commentaries."
1,Worst online shopping experience ever.,"I purchased this $25 product from the seller. It did not work, it would not hot sync with my Treo 650. After paying a computer consultant to diagnose the defect I returned it for a refund (I paid a total of $10 for shipping both ways). I requested a refund equal to the purchase price less the cost to send the refund and I did not request a refund of the shipping costs. The seller said it was not his ""policy"" to provide refunds. Don't purchase anything from this guy. After several hours of back and forth e-mails with Seller I am having to resort to the Amazon A-Z refund policy. I still recommend Amazon, but not this guy."
1,stevia,book is very out dated-try to find a book that is up to date. book is historic at best. one two three foour five six
3,Stevia,"It's ok. It's hard to apply the recipes because they call for different types of stevia - some powdered, some liquid."
2,Unappealing recipes,"Being new to stevia and very confused about how to cook with it, the types of stevia available and the sugar/stevia conversion proportions, I was eager to get this book. I was very disappointed. First off, the book seems light on both information about stevia and recipes. But more important, as a few other reviewers have noted, the recipes that are contained in the book are either so unappealing you have no desire to make them, or don't taste very good once you do make them. For example, I wanted a few good pudding recipes. The butterscotch pudding contains 4 cups of yams. The lemon pudding has yellow squash as its base. Now, I'm all for vegetables, but when I'm eating dessert, I want dessert. Not squash puree. I made a spaghetti squash recipe that had proportionally so much stevia it was sickening. I'm a good and experienced cook. These recipes were awful. Not recommended."
3,STEVIA QUALITY IS KEY,"I haven't tried this book, I used the ""Low-Carb Cooking with Stevia"" by James Kirkland. Pure stevia does not have an aftertaste when used in correct quantities. I'm sure those who got headaches had stevia with fillers. This is evidenced by the fact that they had to use a lot more ""stevia."" NO way! Pure Stevia sweetens with an incredibly small quantity, leaves no aftertaste, and does not produce headaches. Many people have tried the recipes I made from Kirkland's book. They can't believe there's no sugar in them! You have to convince a real heath food store to carry pure stevia. Too many people have tried the green powder (ugh!) or the stevia with fillers. Once you try the good stuff you'll never go back to sugar or Splenda!"
1,Not so good,"This book sounds like a great book. However, if you already know a little Russian, you will realize that a lot of the phonetic pronunciations are inaccurate. There are many instances where 'd' and 't' sounds are written wrong. Also the very common Russian sound 'ye' is often written as only 'e'.While most Russians are accomodating and will try to understand what you are saying, you may as well get a book that at least attempts to give you the proper pronunciation of words.Also included in this book is a section on Russian curse words. I'm not sure why anyone would need to know them but if you do, maybe you will like this book."
4,Great info,Love the slang and contemporary phrases. Great for me to review the Russian I had learned half a century ago in college. Don't know how it would be for a total neophyte.
3,Buy it so your Russian friends can have a laugh,"Numbers, grammar, polite phrases, telling time, and the small dictionary are fine.At Christmas dinner, the phrases caused four women from Moscow or St. Petersburg to dissolve into tears as they laughed while reading selections from the book to each other. Odd word choices combined with an eccentric selection of phrases were the problem. Mind you, the Russian was fine, but starting with ""Let's have a drink!"" and ending the page with ""I'm going to be sick."" and ""I'm hungover."" was perhaps too much on the topic.Have fun on your trip to Russia."
3,Be careful of some strong language...,"This appears to be a book with lots of helpful information. Unfortunately, it also contains a full page of Russian profanity, with English translations, which of course my 7-year-old happened to read. That and some other off color material is unnecessary in a book such as this, so I'm returning it. Watch pages 22 and 73 in particular."
2,Lonely Planet Russian Phrasebook,"Possibly an excellent book for a student of the Russian Language, but too much info for the casual traveler to Russia. I did not have the time or inclination to study pages of grammar and pronunciation when a phonetic translation would have surficed. Also, when words were spelled phonetically the stress syllable was not ""stressed"" with darker ink and the""quick reference"" had no clue as to what syllable is stressed(unless one read pages and pages of pronunciation.) I also objected to the profanities. Who needs to know how to be crude and rude in another language?"
4,For a tough language the book helped,"Short of having a translator it is not easy to go to any place that speaks Russian and communicate effectively. It's just not an easy language to pick up just for a trip. But for a tough language the guide does a good job.The dictionary has lots of common and handy travel phrases. And if you work at it people will understand you. But even when they try to tell you how to pronounce a word or phrase you are always a ways off because the sounds of Russian are so different. Could any book do better? Can't say.Best bet nowadays for Russian or any really tough languages is the iPhone app that just says it for you. Kind of impersonal if you literally let it do the talking, but if you don't at least you can hear how it should sound (or closer than your guess). Some other speaking translator gadget also would be a good option. Were we to travel again that would be my choice."
4,"Good fun- the Fastback's ""Rocket Man"" is brilliant.","Good fun for fans of the old K-Tel compilations from the 1970s. The disk is predictably uneven, but contains some real gems, especially the Fastback's version of ""Rocket Man"" and a folk version of ABBA's ""Dancing Queen."" If you are hankerin' for a hunk of cheese, this is the disk for you."
1,Pointless to read,"This is a rambling, incoherent book that offers little insight about how real people can help their kids through the teen years. Examples: Chapter Nineteen, ""Choice"" of suport system. ""The choice of a support system is very important. Enrolling my children into the Waldorf and Montessori school systems allowed me to learn a new way of looking at life."" Wow, good for her. The chapter then goes on for paragraph after paragraph about all the confidence boosting decisions she's made in her life. I'm really happy she felt good about herself when she learned to golf at age 40, but wait, isn't this book about teens mattering? Ooops, guess not."
5,I can't put it down,"I teetered between 4 and 5 stars because as much as I'm liking this story it isn't one of the truly great ""graphic novels"" ever is it? I decided I was rating it for what it was, a collection of super-team comics, and by that standard the choice is clear. This is 5 star work.I'm so glad I bought all the books in this series together because I can't stop reading them. The surprises and revelations remind me of what got me interested in comics in the first place. This is just really cool story telling with really cool characters.Make sure you check outOutsiders: Looking for TroubleandOutsiders: Sum of All Evil (Vol. 2)first. Also, when you're done with this you're going to want to readTeen Titans/Outsiders: The Insiders"
3,Graphic SF Reader,"It seems that Nightwing is having a lot of problems dealing with issues emotionally, at the moment. As such, the team starts to question his decisions after the continually run into problems. The man Arsenal has been getting help from, and advice, about their current missions, appears to be Batman. A big surprise awaits at the end of this story."
1,A bunch of crap,"The book is a sham...a ""O""... author knows nothing about dogs other than to dump lucky into the hands of any celebrity she can get a hold of to have her picture taken. This author does not know what she's talking about because she's still single approaching her 40's and her dog is a nasty little critter. I can't believe I actually read through the whole book. The book was so bad, I had my dog stomp on it several times."
5,THIS BOOK IS OFF-THE-LEASH!,"What a fun, insightful and entertaining read! WHAT A LUCKY DOG make a great gift for ANY dog lover (and any single female too). Wendy Diamond is clearly an expert on the topic (given her background, I'd expect nothing less - her magazine is great too). Cute, smart and stylish, this book is a must-have for all animal lovers!"
1,Cant I rate this a zero???,"Advice about how a dog is like a bachelor??? Having read the excerpt and editorial opinion of the book's publisher (self-published book), I cannot believe its worth this much paper (including my own, but still Ill have to keep it quick so even I dont get bored!)OK so the author is a mid-30s single woman in New York City who focuses on her dog a lot. Or other people dogs? And the logical connection to spending any more time is that you agree that dogs reflect the owner, soooooo.... you can come to a meaningful relationship with the dog-owner by looking into the dogs face? OK the only thing that happens is you get your face licked, right??Upshot: Roll over and play bored!"
5,One of my favorite children's books,"My grandmother read this to me again and again when I was a little boy, even more than Where the Wild Things Are. I read this to my son and my daughter too. This is the best book gift that I give to friends for their children's birthdays. (Well, if they hate the book, they certainly don't tell me!)And I still have my 39-year-old beatup copy of it too."
1,Decadent Evil 2,"Sugar and Dex have survived Morella's wrath, but now it is up to them to stop another foul vampire lord from collecting the last remaining souls he needs in order to grant himself immortality, using a sleazy strip club as his front for luring in new victims. Like the previous film, DECADENT EVIL 2 is utter garbage, and barely passable even as a cheesy B-movie. Some may say that the insufferable characters, unimaginative plot, and artless direction should all be expected from a Full Moon film of the time, but Charles Band generally brings some fun form of exploitation to even the worst of his features. The sex doesn't sell here, and neither does the horror.-Carl ManesI Like Horror Movies"
5,"Great lyrics,music, & vocals Erin is a rising star",I loved the lyrics especially in todays world of hate. One World should be picked up by the Olympics. Very moving.
5,A Star Is Born....,"Erin Hamilton is a star about to be born....a dance diva that rates head and shoulders above the rest of the rush of female vocalists crowding the market. The writing on this album is FIERCE, production stellar, and it's energy is boundless. Three singles into the album, THE TEMPLE is the latest release and is guaranteed to produce another feather in Erin's cap. If you ever have the chance to catch Erin live in your town, don't miss it!"
5,Excelent beat great lyrics and an amazing voice equal magic,I first bacame aware of Erin Hamilton in Indianapolis Indiana in March of 1999 at OP's.I was stuned and amazed.I knew was seeing one of the worlds newest Divas.She is heading for greatness.Her vocals bring a feeling that can't be described in a single word.The only word that even comes close is euphoria!
4,Hamilton Steers Clear of Typically Cliched Dance Filler,"Though dance divas seem to multiply tenfold every year, few can release a album's worth of strong material. Which makes Erin Hamilton's debut disc ONE WORLD all the more welcome. Even more impressive is the fact that she doesn't seem to be vying for any type of pop-style crossover--much like dance great Kristine W, Hamilton keeps the record steeped in club beats, whether they be of the Hi-NRG variety('The Flame')or early hours stompers('The Temple','Melt'). Her discofied interpretations of both 'The Flame' and 'Dream Weaver' offer a fresh respite from the tired and dusty originals(in the case of 'The Flame', her version is actually superior to the sappy original). Vocally, her voice has a slightly jazzy-cum-rock feel to it, suggesting an only slightly less sturdy Kristine W. Highly recommended for your inner club child."
5,Dance Music at its Best,"I bought the CD for DREAM WEAVER months ago, and I kept waiting for this to come out! Now that it is out there I am so pleased. It has a high NRG dance sensibility paired with moving lyrics. Erin is a great singer and the production values are top-notch. Fans of CHER, THE PET SHOP BOYS, and DONNA SUMMER will find this album satisfying. It's up-lifting, and moves you in several ways. Nobody I've played it for has anything but good things to say! I waiver on buying dance albums for fear that they may not live up to the singles, but this album stands up to the great work she's already done with the singles. I can't say enough about how much it has touched me!"
2,This is not a Clean Version,"First off let me say that this is an excellent album that once again shows the immense talent that LL Cool J brings to each and every project. My only complaint is that this is supposed to be the Clean version of his album and it isn't. It's exactly the same as the album that has the ""Explicit"" warning on it. Obviously the label screwed up but that still doesn't help anyone whose mistakenly bought this as I did thinking it was a Clean version. That's the only reason my review was 2 stars :("
4,Not that color,"This punch and chisel set is made by craftsman and backed up by a lifetime warranty, so i'm very pleased with it. The only shocker was that they are not red like in the picture...they're just plain black steel."
4,Banger!!!,"This is epmd's best album in my opinion. ""Crossover"" alone worths the title. Although many people say it's their darkest album, even so I considered my favourite. The cd is short but sometimes less is more!!!"
4,a nice listen...,"short, powerful, cool, dope, and all of the above. The production is nice raw early ninetees, but still funkdafied and definately a nice listen. The songs are a good mix and the emcees are as raw and on-point as ever (and there not nervous about telling you it)....peace,"
1,Shoot Me Please!,"This is one of the most annoying things ever created!! My sis got it for me as a gag gift for X-Mas and it drove me nuts ten minutes after I took the wrapping off. The button is accessable, so anyone can turn it on which is a real headache, not to mention that these no way of turning it off, unless you take the batteries out.(which I did) If you want to annoy someone...get them this..otherwise, save your money!"
1,Buyer Beware of This Barware,"I got this corkscrew, put it to it's intended purpose only to discover that it was not to be. Sure, I got the cork out of the bottle, but when I tried to remove the cork from the corkscrew I could not. Trying to twist the cork off the device only accomplished one thing, the whole 'screw' part of the tool kept falling out and I was left with the cork and the screw in my hand. As I could not change the direction of the threading as the designer should have done in the first place, my only recourse was to cut the cork away and store my leftover wine with a makeshift cover. Who makes an item like this? At least some of my fellow reviewers here got one use out of it. I suppose I can try some crazy glue to see if I can get it to hold together, but I would never recommend this item and am rather resentful that I need to now extensively research the purchase of a corkscrew to make sure I don't get screwed again."
2,Pass on this one,Not worth the money. I used this on many bottles and always had a hardtime getting the tip of the screw to bit into the cork. Finally tossed it.Find something else.
3,Avoid!,"I like Pedrini bar ware and though this is nicely made, I do not like this type of corkscrew. They are slow and are notorious for ripping through corks. Do yourself a favor and buy a Screwpull PocketScrewpull Pocket Model Corkscrew, Blackor, if your budget is up to it, a rabbit type corkscrewScrewpull? by Le Creuset Lever Wine Opener Gift Set"
3,"Decent product, not very good quality","This is a decent corkscrew; it gets the job done, but it is not the best quality. It is plastic-y, and be careful about how far into the cork you screw the screw: if you get it too deep in the cork and try to unscrew it, it just unscrews out of the socket instead of the cork."
3,Good book,"Something nagging at me is preventing me from giving this book 5 stars. For one thing, it's purported to be a handbook for current psychology majors, but the first one or two chapters are directed towards evaluating reasons for selecting psychology as a major. If you're not sure or still shaky on your major being psychology, this may help; but for those who are positive and solid in their choice, it's not helpful. To me it states too many things that are obvious. It's definitely not worth nearly $30! ""Getting In,"" the APA-written manual on getting into graduate school, was a little over $10 and was a much better buy than this book.However the book is good, and it may help those wishy-washy major-changers settle on whether or not psychology is good for them. My advice: borrow it from someone who has it, or find it at the library, and then decide if it's a constant reference you'll need or one-time reading material."
4,Just the right size,"this works realy great the cards stay intact and the the pockets don't rip. sturdy cover too I even accidently ran mine over with my jeep and still , just like new."
3,Spring Hose,"While this spring hose works pretty well, in that it does roll back up nicely after using it, I have some trouble with it catching on objects when attempting to water at a distance. Maybe it's because it is still new, hasn't been used a lot, so therefore is still stiff. I'd be more apt to give it another star, possibly, after using it for a longer period of time."
1,Not Worth The Price,"Unfortunately,the connections on the hose are extremely tinny. The connection to the faucet leaked from the very beginning. I didn't discover it, however, until it was too late to return it since I thought it was the faucet itself that was leaking. After fixing the faucet and hooking up the hose, I discovered that it was the hose connection all along that was leaking. All I'm hoping now is that I can attach a new connection so that I can use the hose. Otherwise, it's money down the drain.If yo9u're looking for a quality product, this isn't it."
3,Works as a hose,"I was not impressed with the coiling feature. It is too ""tight"" to be able to stretch around corners. Live and learn. The description was accurate and shipping was good. Just not what I was looking for."
2,"sturdy hose, but connections are bad",I would say the hose itself is very sturdy and flexible. Unfortunately the connectors on each end are a little weak and flimsy. It is not of sturdy metal. It looks like it's made of aluminum. The connections are not tight and leakage can occur. I now have to go out to buy some plumbing tape to prevent as much water leakage as possible.
2,poor hardware,"""DeLuxe"", but they didn' want to use brass fittings. They did save $ : MINE, because I'll never get this brand again."
5,Best garden purchase this summer!,"We finally threw in the towel on our garden hoses that kept getting trashed, and purchased two of these (one 25' and one 50') earlier this summer. We love them. No kinks, no tangles, no need to wrap up the hose every time you use it. I store it against the house in a semi-rounded wrought iron planter - perfect!One note: the length of the hose is deceiving. Due to the coil it doesn't actually reach as far as the length might indicate. Go for a bigger length if you are on the fence about sizing."
5,Wonderful invention!,"I use these wraps all the time. They are stretchy, with velcro on the ends for easy attaching. And they stay put. I have a few and they keep ice packs or heat packs on your arm, leg, knee, ankles etc. I strap 2-3 together if I need the heat/cold on my back or shoulder. They work great and have lasted for years."
3,Good but could use a little tweeking,"I am a retired teacher and bought this for my 3 year old granddaughter. It is cute and durable. She liked it but needed a lot of help. The ""thread"" is long and thick, so it gets stuck when lacing. I'm going to buy a thinner, shorter lacing string which I think will work better. It would also be nice if it came with two bears so the one bear wouldn't need to be undressed all the time. Two bears would also give her the added option of imaginative play--kind of like paper dolls."
4,Neat little toy,"My daughter loves this bear. The box has no lid, so pieces get lost, and it's a pain in the rear to store. The product pic for this listing is deceptive, as it makes it look as though there are multiple bears, but the description is accurate: one bear, two laces, several outfits. You can replace the laces if they get banged up, or try skinnier laces with different feels to them."
1,Not as promised,"I watched a movie that featured this composer's music and was intrigued by it. But the CD is very, very disappointing. It isn't even good ""background music""--just bad music."
2,Too weird and not enough action.,"I was looking for action and martial arts and ended up with this strange movie. It turns out to be a wannabe Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon style movie but with no plot and flashback scenes that get confusing. While there was a certain artistry to it, the plot was weak and centers around a story that never really makes sense or comes together in any climactic way. I kept hoping watching and waiting for something to happen but it never did. I wouldn't recommend it unless you are having difficulty sleeping and need to sedate yourself."
2,jade warrior,"this movie had some good scenes in it, but the title & the content of this movie is misleading. wouldnt have bought it if had preview the actual movie."
2,No confundir con películas épicas,"Si, como a mi, te gustan las películas japonesas,chinas o coreanas que tratan sobre temas épicos (tipo Tai chi master,Red Cliff, Seven Swords, The Warlords, etc),o sobre heroes masculinos o femeninos (Azumi,Blood,Musa the warrior,Ninja assasin,etc) esta película seguramente no te va a gustar. La verdad que vi el trailer y resulto ser engañoso. Se trata de una película finlandesa que narra una leyenda, pero no llega a atrapar en ningun momento. No tiene muy claro el argumento, y el final es, para clasificarlo de alguna manera, bastante pobre. Una película mala realmente."
1,Don't judge a book by it's cover,"That saying applies to this movie. I thought I was getting a martial arts flick when I bought this, but boy was I disappointed. It's does have fight scenes in it, only about 3, but it's more of a romance movie and a bad one at that. The acting is good but the story and writing isn't all that great."
4,An enigma,"How to classify this work?equal parts The KalevalaThe Kalevala: The Epic Poem of Finlandthe bride with white hairThe Bride with White Hairand a chinese ghost storyChinese Ghost Storyit blends the Finnish creation myth with Chinese Wuxia swords & sorcery, incorporating elements of karma, reincarnation and ancient forces at work in the modern world.I'd like to say it works completely, but it left me with a sense of something 'not-quite-perfect' about the whole thing, like a meal with an ingredient missing that makes it all fall just slightly short of being truly satisfying. Having said that however, it is an intriguing mix of themes, styles, influences and cultures that's, in my opinion at least, well worth a try."
5,This is golden music!,"Excellent CD!!!I bought several CDs with MM: All of them are great. No matter what title you buy, you will enjoy it a lot!"
2,not for me,The music did not help in my meditation. It was actually distracting. No wonder no samples were available for listening.
4,Amazing Chakra Meditation Music,This is a fantastic CD for meditation. I've recently just started to (try) meditating and have not been that successful unless guided.This CD has really helped me to begin going deeper on my own. Great buy!
5,Good product. Good deal.,"I had previously purchased the 3/16"" X 125ft X 24"" Bubble Wrap Roll from Propackagingsupply, but it was unavailable at the time so I bought this version by Packitright Bubble instead. This bubble wrap is lesser quality (thinner plastic backing, difficult to see the perforated tear lines) and the roll was shipped in plastic, not a box like the Propackagingsupply was shipped. However, you get 175ft here compared to 125ft with the Propackagingsupply version. And this bubble wrap gets the job done, even though it's of cheaper quality. I would buy this again, since it arrived quickly (only 2 days from Kansas I believe) and works perfectly for my needs.EDIT: Why do they keep increasing the price? It was $15 free shipping, then $22 free shipping and now $29 free shipping. Going to look elsewhere."
5,GREAT SELLER from AMAZON!!!!,"I Will definitely buy from this seller again. The price couldn't be beat, the item was exactly what was described, and it came with in the guesstimated time frame!!!"
1,Total waste of 57 dollars,"Do NOT buy this, you will not need it. Most of the stuff included is junk and there are no instructions with it anyway."
1,Bad spinner,The rotating spinner in this kit broke.Had not used it very much. Loved it untilthat happened. Used the spinner morethan the other attachments.
1,Great if you never want to use your phone!,"The Wireless Technologies swivel belt holster does clip onto your belt or whatever, it does swivel well, and it does securely clamp your TREO 600/650 in place. Beyond that it is virtually useless. The spring clamp extends over the top center of the phone, creating quite a problem. If you have an SD card in your TREO, it will almost certainly be dislodged by this clamp, and if you are not using an SD card the clamp end will jam in the card slot if you don't have the SD slot dummy card in there (to get dislodged, of course). Spend your funds on a better holster than this one, unless you enjoy wasting your money."
1,Awful,This device is unusable with a Treo 600. Every time you try to put the phone in or take it out it pops out the memory card. Don't waste your money.
2,Swiveling Belt Holster,Label states that it is for a 600....it doesnt fit a 650 as well as I thought it
2,Huffy Venice Recumbent Comfort Bike,My sister who is an avid bike rider told me to go to the local bike shops and ride different styles of bikes first before buying...instead I assumed that the design of the bike plus the seat was going to be a winner for me...unfortunately it was just not for me. Sadly enough the box was delivered damaged...inside was a mess...multiple damages...my Dad and I attempted to put it together anyway. My husband was unaware of the situation and threw the box out so now we are stuck with it. I ended up going to my local bike shop and buying something else that I am truly happy with. My only advice to buying a bike online is already knowing the make and model.
3,OK Comfort Bike,"I was also able to get one of these at Meijer on season closeout. It was somewhat damaged by all the kids playing with it in the store. We thought, with the small wheels, it would be good for my wife who is not very athletic. The bike is not a true recumbent but is more of a comfort bike. The bike looks cool and is fun if you can find one for $75."
3,Huffy recumbent bike,"Cannot adjust handlebars to allow me to ride in a recumbent position. I am average height for a woman (5'6"")."
2,XM Car Kit Review,XM car kit package was missing vehicle vent clip as well as a sure-connect cable. I contacted the seller and was told it was not included in the package. Had to find these items from another source.
2,Does not have Aux Input!!!!!!!!,This docking station does not have an aux input as the description stated. I have called Amazon and they sent me a new unit and it is the same way. Needless to say Amazon has not stepped up and made this right for me this time. I am stuck with a unit that I can't hook up my mp3 player with.
2,Not really,"I would never buy this toy.I mean for the accessories,mayby,but never because of the doll.Her face is sooooooooo ugly,I mean nature isn't that cruel.Her dress is not worth any words,good or bad.And the hair,not even worth to be looked at.It's very rough and it feels very cheap.The accessories are sort of fine,but i would never wear them in public."
4,So many activities to keep entertained,I bought the V.Smile for my older neice and recently purchased this for her younger sister. She's almost 2 and LOVE this. I was very pleased at the pacing and simple animations for the age group. I also love the fact that it's a toy or a console that plugs easily into the TV. But the best part is the baby sign language. There's so much packed into this system for $40.
1,Breaks down easily,I bought this for our daughters to play and learn. If you take the disc out wrong it will stop working. We are on our 3rd machine all for the same reasons. Not sure why we keep buying one.
1,Don't buy this toy!!!!,I purchased this for my daughter when my grandson was 14 months old and asked her for it back when she said he wasn't interested in it. After viewing the cartridges I have to say I'm pretty dissappointed in the graphics and intend on putting the whole thing in the trash!If you and your child have watched any of the Baby Einstein DVDs this product will not hold your interest.I can recommend Leap Frog Baby's Little Leaps. My grandson loves this toy and never tires of playing with it.
3,Could be better,I bought this for my son's second birthday. He has sensory processing disorders and he doesn't talk. Someone told me that this toy taught sign language so I thought it would be perfect for him. We've only tried it a couple of times but the graphics are so bad that it is hard to even see the signs being taught. The keyboard functions as a stand alone game (without hooking up the rest of it to the TV) and my son is perfectly happy playing with it like that.
5,I Love Educational Toys!,"I love this game system, and I bought it primarily because it is educational. I have a fourteen month old daughter, and she enjoys looking at the colors, and she's learning to say the names of the colors. She's also learning to count with this system. I also liked that the system itself comes with a game, even though I bought a few others on my own. I would recommend this system over the Grow With Me System, because there are many more games for this one. The other system only had about three games, and kids do get bored easily, so I'm very happy with my selection."
2,Not impressed.,"My toddler refuses to play with this toy. I bought this for her when she was nine months old and she showed no interest. The quality of this product was much poorer than I expected. The Leapfrog system looks much cuter. My daughter is now almost two and since we bought it I have tried it about once a month. Even though she loves the toddler computer games, she still shows no interest in this. To be fair, the toy does have alot of educational value if you can get your child to play it. I'll keep trying, but I'm beginning to think that this toy just isn't for us."
2,Not impressed,"Our 10 month old son LOVES to bang on the computer. We tried giving him a keyboard but he wasn't satisfied with just banging--he wanted to see what was happening on the screen, so we bought him this toy. He liked playing with the 'keyboard' while in the car, which initially I thought the 'play alone' option was a nice feature, but I was disappointed the buttons didn't light up in addition to making sounds. He got tired of the toy after about 10 minutes in the car. We brought it home and hooked it up to the TV and he was not impressed. He was quickly bored with the limited capabilities of the buttons and was not interested in the graphics on the TV. We decided to return this and try the giggles software for the computer instead (offers kids a safe way to push the keyboard buttons without putting files at risk) and rely on good, old fashioned toys and books to educate our child instead of relying on technology."
3,not worth the money,"an aunt bought this for my son for christmas when he was 14 months old. he never really got into it. i thought he would at least benefit from the ""learn sign language"" feature on the games but they were not at all attention grabbing. he was much more interested in the part that held the game cartridge, which unfortunately had to be within his reach in order for the ""controller"" to work and so we never got very far with this product. he is almost three now and i have another one year old so i often think about turning this on to see if they would be interested but most of the game cartridges are lost in my house right now.the ""controller"" has a play on your own feature and my son and daughter have always loved that. but it by itself is definitely not worth the cost of this product."
2,slow,"My 23 month old son recieved this for Christmas. I was really excited about it until we plugged it in... It barely hold his attention for more than a couple of minutes. It is so slow and boring. We will not be investing any more money into trying other cartriges. I haven't looked into the version for the next age group, maybe that is why it seems so slow to me. I am not impressed for the money."
5,Great product!,"I purchased this product for my grandson. He is 16 months and he loves playing with his V-Smile. He knows how to turn it on and how to select what he wants to do. This toy keeps him occupied for a long time. Since most children his age have short attention spans,it is amazing how long he will play and not become bored. There are times when he only wants to listen and not look at what is happening. He seems to want to hear what is being said while he play with another object. When the talking stops, he will go over and select again. He has many toys and this is the only toy that he seems to truly love."
1,Not impressed,"I am frustrated by this system. I suppose when compared to one of those other systems (like Wii or DS) it is a bargain but I resent the fact that if you want to upgrade, the cartridges for older kids are not compatible with this system.First, for those of us who didn't want our children to watch TV until they were 2, it's pointless. We received this as a gift for our son's first b-day and before I could stop my husband from tearing into it, he had opened it up and made it impossible to return.Now that we are comfortable with our two-year-old using it, I am not impressed with the graphics OR the audio.All the cartridges compatible with the system are labeled for 18-36 months so now, my son would only get a years worth of usefulness out of it IF we chose to keep it and use it.Don't waste your money."
1,The game is junk,i buyed this game it work fine then a week later it stop working i toke it back and brand new the touch pade dont work and all it come on tv screen is vtech when game is on the system. I tell others beware ware of produce. It not the coast of 49.95 on store shelf at walmart or any weres.
2,This thing is a JOKE! Needs a lot of work!,"This product does not hold my toddler's attention in the least. She would rather play with her toy piano, riding car, blocks, stuffed animals, and look at her books than even bat an eye at this thing. The concept of this baby learning station is excellent, however the graphics and content are rather crude and ineffective. Either V.Smile needs to can this product altogether, or they need to improve the graphics and content."
2,Not what I expected,"Bought for my 19mo old daughter. She was vaguely entertained, but not for long. Was looking for something she could play with more on her own as she loves interactive toddler websites. Plugging the cables into the TV proved most interesting. As another review mentions, many of the words are not pronounced correctly, and the language is very ""choppy"" -- sounds like a computer talking! Songs only sing for a single verse. Much less than I expected for Vtech, and especially for Baby Einstein. Disapointed, and returning for something different."
1,Won't work with a big screen tv,"I bought this and a couple of the cartridges for my grandaughter's first birthday. My son only has a large screen tv--I mean really one of the huge ones. The graphics are just an awful blur, and I think it's because the tv screen is so large. It would probably look better on a small screen but wish I had known its limitations before I bought the thing.It was hooked up for about 2 days and then thrown out in the garage so this was a complete waste of money."
2,"Just ""ok""","Trying to get my daughter (whom is pretty smart) to view the television at the same time she pressed buttons in the console was almost impossible. Graphics are terrible, better than Atari, but worse than the first Nintendo. Not impressed at all."
2,boring,I bought this toy for my 9 month old daughter at christmas last year. In almost a year the most fun she has had with it is pushing the on buttong to see the blue light. It is incredibly durable and has been thrown around many times without being broken or even scratched. I like that the cushioned wrist rest comes off and can be thrown in the washing machine but it comes off too easily and my daughter likes to take it off and carry it around the house. The resoloution is horrendous which was not what I was expecting and it was probably my biggest dissapointment. It didnt cost too much money so I guess I got what I paid for but I cant say that I will buy another vtech product in the near future. I would much rather spend a little more for leap frog and know the quality will be good.
5,very pleased,"my daughter really enjoys this product and is learning for preschool with it.she is learning to count,her colors,and shapes.since playing with this product she can count to 15 knows all her colors and shapes."
2,May cause a Mobius loop in your home theater,"Sure the music sounds awesome through these cables but due to an extremely low common mode rejection ration, my neighbors fluorescent lights set up a standing wave in my rack that opened a mobius loop in my basement. In short... I love the transparency they have added to my system but could live without the unwanted sleastacks that crawled through the time/space rip. Thanks Denon! See you in hell."
3,Not for dogs,My dog ate it.He is now a demon lord and has an army of hellhounds.Run.It is your only hope.
2,Saddened with a touch of melancholy.,I hoped this cable would clear up a problem I was having. Sadly it didn't. My Commodore 64 is still really slow. It did tie a ladder on to my truck really well.
1,Please help i'm trapped in this box!,"Please help i'm trapped in this box!CAN ANYONE SEE THIS!?I plugged in my Denon AKDL1 Dedicated Link Cable the day i got it,Then a green glowing void opened up in the middle of my basement!I was quickly grabbed by strange semi-see through oozing tentacles that dragged me into what I could only assume would be hell!I don't know how long passed in the blackness,But I remembered thinking to myself over those,...days,...weeks,....months,....years?How this couldn't possibly be from this magical 500$ cable.Now I am trapped inside this box,I look out but all i can see are people staring like they don't even see me...Please tell me you can see this text?I'M TRAPPED INSIDE THIS BOX PLEASE GET ME OUT OF HERE!I SEE YOU READING THIS STOP ACTING LIKE YOU DON'T SEE ME!I NEED HELP!THIS IS SERIOUS!Please buy a Denon AKDL1 Dedicated Link Cable immediately!It's the only way to get me out of here!It's ONLY 500$...."
3,We're not worthy!,"You guys can laugh if you want but after submitting my order for this I was visited by Denon Agents who screened me for ownership eligibility. They first searched my house for any signs of Monster cables. I tried to convince them that all my connections were digital as in binary and I didn't feel it was needed that I pay Monster's outrageous prices. I explained that I felt that Denon's pricing must be fair since they really cater to the very selective. I mean, looking at their receiver lineup they have like 95 variations on the same model of receiver which are differentiated by such subtleties as the distance between volume gradations. See, this is a cable for the truly discriminating. In the end, I just couldn't pass muster and the Denon Agents left with a look of both pity and contempt. Oh well, I guess there's always Monoprice."
1,"I can hear voices from the past, future","When I plugged this into my stereo, I heard sounds ranging from the big bang (it was loud) to the year 67987, where man has all but become pure light. I heard my great-grandfather, whom I had never met, tell me his life story, my future grandson tell me to not be such a dick when I'm older.I have learned so much.But I have never felt like less. I now know what life has in store for me, and it is but a faint, dim light."
1,Pure and simple TRUTH,"To those of you who are under the impression that Copper, Silver, or even Roentgenium are superior conductors for home audio use... you are clearly missing the biggest piece of evidence against your theory: Scrooge McDuck.Did he flow seamlessly through a vault full of Copper, Silver and Unununium? Hardly. The pure and simple truth is that Gold is far superior in the transfer of 1's, 0's, and ducks.Also, I've recently added a video on Youtube thats shows a simple way to charge your Ipod using only a Bose Cube speaker, a 4' Monster 1000 series HDMI, and a Denon ADKL1 cable. Simply fascinating!(Spoiler) This experiment can also be done using only the ADKL1, but I felt the inclusion of the Cube and Monster cable would only go to prove to my friends and fellow audiophiles how poorly I manage my expenses."
1,You'd be stupid not to buy this.,"At nine THOUSAND, nine HUNDRED and NINETY-NINE dollars, you'd be stupid not to buy this. What, you think Radio Shack has these for $20? Pft."
3,Life held no meaning for me until this cable entered my Home....,"OMG....there is a price to be paid, every time somebody buys one of these cables a kitten dies..... why people why would you do that to the kittens...Although the cable is awesome, I connected to my Radiogram and was able to communicate with Einstein, we had a deep and meaningful conversation about the true origin of Mitt Romney, would have given 5 stars if kittens did not die"
3,Can someone tell me...,I tried using this to fix my food blender. Now all my butternut squash lal and bean soups are blue. Is the cable unidirectional?
1,This is such a ripoff!!!,I love the product and it does everything I hoped for and more (mainly boosting the power of my very light saber) but the discount for the Kindle ElectronOnly version was so pathetic so I decided to pony up for the EntireAtom version only to find that Amazon refused to ship at the Prime rate %-( I'm never shopping Amazon again - these guys may buy in bulk but they sell in bilk!!!
1,Maybe NASA or the Air Force purchased these in the 80's,"My Ethernet packets went through this cable, and while they looked shiny when they came out... when I opened them up to look inside, they still contained the same data. If you bought this item and liked it, I have a special rare magnet from uranus that you can attach to it to get even better sound. I'll sell it to you for only $450."
1,Weather Resistance didn't work!,"I was initially buying this product for its weather resistance claim.Since I tend to leave my $5695.22 Denon head unit outside in the rain, I was really hoping this cable would keep my unit safe from the elements. While it initially did a great job at wisking away the errant raindrops that would have ruined my system, a change in wind conditions confused the cable and my main unit was soaked. Needless to say, this crappy cable failed to do the one thing I really needed it to do and my system is totally fried.Let the buyer beware. You have been warned."
5,I contacted BP about the oil leak in the gulf...,So i was at work today when i figured out how to stop the oil leak in the gulf of mexico it was so obvious. I sent BP the link to this cable.. the way i see it if they order today hopefully have it by friday and the leak is stopped by saturday-sunday at the latest
1,MULTIPLE USES OF THIS WONDERFUL HIFI INTERCONNECT,"I must say as a REAL AUDIOPHILE I think I am a little better qualified to review this cable than other people. After many months of PURE ORGASMIC PLEASURE listening to Lady Ga Ga and Brian Ferry on my Pzower-BOff Signature 101-J mp3 turntable, linked to a $10 preamp from craigslist (don't knock it till you've tried it), I decided enough was enough and 'went wifi with my hifi'.Hence, my Denon ethernet cable was redundant... UNTIL I realised how many other gadgets these days have ethernet! Skeptically I hooked up my Samsung SMS755WTFLOL microwave using this badboy and BBOOOM, it exploded. Next I tried my webcam-enabled doorbell... THE RESULT?: audio heaven. Now when someone pushes my buzzer I get to hear a rich pulsating blast of 40hz that words cannot describe. The soundstaging has been improved by 17.2%..! If you don't believe me I even checked with my wife, and she said the same thing - 17.2%... perfect."
2,Okay for a cheap cable.,"I guess it's an OK cable if you just wanna go cheap, but doesn't Amazon have any better, more expensive cables?? I won the lottery and I don't know what to do with my $130 million."
5,In sickness and in health,The AKDL1 and I are to be married this Saturday by the Head of the Denon R&D team in a small ceremony on the beach. I've finally found my Cable.
1,This cable prevents global warming,"Since the dawn of man (or maybe 1978), the earth has been warming at an alarming (or maybe just normal given the current solar activity) rate. However, since this cable was introduced, the earth has actually cooled. Therefor this cable has single hand...double endedly solved man's greatest threat (or miscarriage of science)."
3,ARGGGGHHHH!,"I was going to write a scathing review of this cable because the lack of the inclusion of an illustrated, step-by-step instruction manual detailing which end should be plugged into which device's port. Yeah, I know it has the same connector on each end and that it's a 50-50 proposition, but whenever there's a 50-50 odds of something 90% of the time I get it wrong or the short end of the stick...it's because I'm a guy, my wife is forever reminding me. I mean, hopefully the wrong part of that and not the short stick part. Come to think of it, that would explain a lot of things..."
2,"No longer needed cable, found a DIY alternative","I purchased this cable knowing about Denon's great reputation. Considering the price and the brand, I figured there had to be something special. After hours of comparison with other cables, I decided to return it, the difference was negligible, plus I was tired of eating only RAMEN noodles after the purchase. After much research, I discovered a great DIY project that didn't even need cables to connect my devices. The only thing required was a picture of Chuck Norris in the room. Now the signals just leap to each device with no lag for fear of being killed by Chuck Norris!"
1,additional use,"You people are crazy. Listen to your ears (they are the things under your hair). I was going to buy the monster cable rca cables for my quadrophonic speaker setup & 8-track deck - until I saw these. For significantly less than I was willing to spend, I gained four twisted pairs of this high-intensity wire. So I stripped the cat5 connector off, and soldered on regular rca plugs. Yes! Air Supply has rarely sounded so sweet! Sure, it seems a little dumb for network cable, but do what I did - it's super thrifty and cheap! The ladies will never notice the difference, I promise. The only thing I might do to make it even better in the future: when I hooked it up to an o-scope, the signal made all these sine-wave looking things - I think I might set up some kind of circuit to cut this down to a straight horizontal line, and truly experience the ultimate sonic bliss that is unadultured DC power!"
2,No Support!,"NO WHERE in the instructions does it tell me where where the heck I can buy the liquid hydrogen to keep the cryo-mass in my AKDL1 cool!I'm worried enough to call the NRC soon, as I'm afraid once the factory loaded liquid hydrogen is gone this thing is going critical on me. If your living anywhere near PA you may want to look into Iodide pills. ttfn..."
1,How to apply the anti-aging properties,"I bought this product a while ago, and after several attempts to figure out how I can benefits from the anti-aging properties I've given up. I tried to sleep with it under my pillow, shower with it, hang it around my neck while at work. NOTHING seems to work, I'm still the exact same age as before! I need to bring it back. Buyers beware, don't buy this to its anti-aging properties, it's not work the money."
2,Too Fast,I purchased this cable in hope of turning my 5mbs internet into 10zbs internet but as soon as I installed my new cable my computer started flashing confidential government websites at lightning fast speed to alien frequencies in other solar systems. After a minute of this my computer imploded into itself opening a portal to hell. I was able to escape before my family was taken. I've been camping outside my house till I can devise a plan to retrieve my cable and return it. As for my family... I'll wait for them to escape on their own time
5,"That's Fermat's Last PROOF now, thanks to Denon!","This marvelous piece of wire not only clarifies the most compressed mp3's while unlogging your intertubes! No more silly elliptic curves, Taniyama-Shimura conjectures or Galois representations. Yes, it's true - it proves Fermat's Last for ALL prime numbers greater than 2, some irrational numbers and pi. Just set it and forget it!"
1,Not as advertsed,"This supposedly is a ""link cable"" but when I tried to link the cable to ""How to Avoid Extremely Large Ships"" I damn near got run over! What a ripoff."
1,Terrible rip off,I can't believe a product like this ever made it to market. This is simply a normal cat 5 or cat 6 STP (shielded twisted pair) cable. You can buy similar cables for $5-$10 at most. I can make my own for about $1...10 cents a foot for raw cable and 25 cents each for the end connectors. The quality will be exactly the same because a digital cable is a digital cable. Either you get the signal or you don't.
1,$500? I'll make you a one of a kind cable for only $250!,"While i have no doubt that Denon makes an outstanding cable, they are mass manufactured! I can hand craft a cable of just as good quality to the length of your choice, and I'll undercut Denon by 50%! It's a deal you can't walk away from!"
1,Somewhat disappointing,"I bought this cable with high hopes, but eventually I had to return it. When I bought it I took it out of the lovely wooden display case and immediately used it to connect my printer to my laptop. I printed a couple of pictures and, well, the quality simply had to be seen to be amazed. It gave my old printer a whole new lease of life.Unfortunately, I was woken up by a commotion later that night and turned the light on to discover the cable in bed with my wife. She claims that she must have caught her foot on it on the way to bed, but I'm not exactly sure. It certainly doesn't explain how the cable ended up wearing one of my best ties. I wrote to Denon and they told me that it was unfortunately quite a common complaint. They offered me another set but, to be honest, I suspect they're all the same."
1,Utterly dishonest,"There is no such thing as a ""quality"" digital connection. This product description is astonishingly misleading. You can get the exact same connection from a $5 digital cable."
5,Schrödinger's Catbox,"At last! The quandary regarding the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics being applied to everyday objects is resolved. On behalf of the human race, I say ""thank you, Denon"".To achieve said results, simply both purchase and not purchase the cable. It should also be noted that reading this review it will influence the outcome."
2,"Great cable, but too fast.","Transmission of music data at rates faster than the speed of light seemed convenient, until I realized I was hearing the music before I actually wanted to play it. Apparently Denon forgot how accustomed most of us are to unidirectional time and the general laws of physics. I tried to get used to this effect but hearing songs play before I even realized I was in the mood for them just really screwed up my preconceptions of choice and free will. I'm still having a major existential hangover.Would not purchase again."
1,Monster is going to sue...,I think Monster will probably sue because they came up with the original idea of ripping off the public and now Denon is stealing their concept.
1,Strength In Numbers,I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate all of those who have commented on this product. It is through your hard work and perseverence that Denon has reduced the price of the product to the far more reasonable $499.99. It is amazing to me that a cable of this quality could be obtained for less than $500.00. AND FREE SHIPPING! Keep up the good work!
1,My husband uses it to beat me...,"I know I'm REAL trouble when my husband untwines his Denon AKDL1 Dedicated Link Cable from around his sweat stained waist. ""Why you feeding me such dismal signal quality down cheap cabling"" he will scream at the top of his voice as the high quality Denon Cable bites into the scarred tramp stamp on my back. ""Not the face Billy-Bob"" I wail in vain! Another week in the trailer before I dare go out again. This product seems perfect for inflicting pain and torture as well as holding up size 48inch denim trousers but does nothing for audio quality. Trust me I know..."
1,Are you kidding me?,"$10,000 for a 1.5 meter long cable? Is this a joke or something? To spend that much on a cable, this had better be coated in a pound of 24 carat gold! Do yourself a favor, and buy a $2 patch cable from Radio Shack. They work just as well as this product overpriced by $9,998 dollars. If you buy this, you deserved to get fleeced!"
4,Give the cable a chance!,"For all of you supposed ""reviewers"" who claim to have experienced the wonders and joy of owning this cable:If you look at Amazon's sales rank for this fine product, it is apparent that few, if any, of you have actually purchased this cable. Rather than being the popular product you claim it to be, it is even being out-sold by the Brown Zune. Your reviews are obviously based on conjecture and not on real-world evidence.Shame on all of you for your deceit and guile! How dare you malign the character of what is obviously an excellent and competitively-priced product."
2,Shameful waste of money in a world gone crazy!,"In today's topsy-turvy world, I imagine there are worthier things to spend $499 on than a cable. Stop, take a deep breath, and think about it for a moment...Craig DuckettSeattle, WA"
1,If you buy this product....,You should have someone looking after your money for you! Are you guys kidding? IT'S A POWER CABLE!!!!
1,Holding out for a better cable,"This IS an excellent cable and certainly a quantum leap in cable design. But I'm gonna wait for the officially licensed ""World of Warcraft"" Ethernet Cable of the Elder, with +42 bit rate, +28 spell critical and improving all drop rates by 19%. Really. It's coming out in tandem with the Lich King expansion. Uh, huh. :P"
2,Anti-aging,"I bought this cable for the anti-aging properties of the insulation, and boy was I disappointed. I still have all my gray hairs and wrinkles. I was going to send it back, but got distracted due to the senility this wire didn't prevent and realized later that it had been stolen by copper thieves. It must be high-quality copper for the thieves to bust into my well-armed fortress for, so I bumped my rating up a star for the copper."
2,will NOT use for bungee again,"Lured in by it's ""bad-ass"" black-and-blue look, claims of safety and ""space-age copper"" stretchiness, I purchased the Denon AKDL1 Dedicated Link Cable for my DIY bungee jumping hobby. I drove out to the Tacoma Narrows Bridge around 5am, tied one end to a railing and the other around my ankle (beware: ankle harness NOT included), took a deep breath and then... GERONIMO!!Well, whaddya know: it snapped on the FIRST jump and I was sent barreling head-first in to the freezing water 50 meters below. I guess there ain't no truth in advertising anymore."
3,Help me please :(,"Hi guysCan someone please help me? I bought one of these and as soon as it entered my house strange things started to happen. Furniture would move by itself, I would hear noises in the night, and sometimes I would see what looked like the ghost of Tom Joad making pies in my kitchen.What's worse is that there is now a dimensional vortex inside my computer that is making more of these cables. One night I woke up to see them strangling my cat. I tried to save Snuggles but he was dragged into the vortex and I haven't seen him since. However another cat came out of the vortex and has glowing red eyes and stares at me while I sleep. Sometimes I swear that he pukes blood and his head rotates 360 degrees :((Please help! I think perhaps I have opened a rift to cat hell?? How do I remove these cables from my house? My mother is visiting tomorrow. Oh god....oh god......helpmehelpmehelpmehelpme"
2,It helped me see Jesus,"As soon as I received these cables I decided to test them by heading over to YouTube to download some clips of the Chipmunks singing Christmas carols. Man, I sure love their sweet singing, but it wasn't the wisest of choices.See, I keep on my computer desk a bottle of A1 steak sauce at all times because it's a really good ointment. If you have skin infections or problems with athletes foot, nothing works better. You never know when your pinky toe starts itching, it's even better than Gold Bond.Anyways, as soon the Chipmunks started singing I was getting this wierd class 3 resonance effect which caused my computer to explode and my bottle of A1 to shatter. Shocked isn't the word for it, but it gets even better! As soon as the smoke cleared I noticed that where my A1 bottle once stood, I had this sauce splatter, still smoldering, and it was in the image of Jesus. Hallelujah!!!!!Thank you Denon!"
1,For people with more money than brains...,"Folks, by it's definition, digital is either ""1"" or ""0"", ""on"" or ""off"", it's not like the cable is carrying ever-so-slightly varying currents to tell your player to play this flute note with the utmost of clarity. No, it's just ""ON"" or ""OFF"", over and over, extremely quickly. The other posts are rightfully making fun of this product. Get a far cheaper digital cable and you'll get the absolute same quality of sound."
4,unimaginable linkage,This is exactly the type of cable they use at the Large Hadron Collider for the mini-blackhole projects. Immense information output of the blackhole requires digital data speed transfers faster than the speed of light (to escape the event horizon) and this is the only cable capable of such speeds. The anti-aging properties of this capable definitely help to prolong its life in the case when ripples in the space-time continuum send equipment back in time.
1,Don't work,"I insert both ends in my ears and not only does my music not sound better, it almost comes out muffled."
1,WARNING: Women of Childbearing Age Beware!,"My boyfriend bought the Denon AKDL1 Dedicated Link Cable and installed it in the bedroom sound system to enhance the mood-setting properties of our Barry White mp3's.Turns out not only did ultrasonic emissions from the cable purge my body of the artificial hormones from my birth control pills, it caused me to hyperovulate. Three months later, I gave birth to fully-developed octuplets.Granted, the AKDL1 also caused me to sprout six more breasts so I can keep the entire litter fed, but it's still a *major* inconvenience. The Denon AKDL1 needs further FDA testing before it's released to the unsuspecting public."
1,This cable healed me!,"This masterpiece of the copper scientician's art restored my sight, and then cured my virginity. It cooks bacon for me, too. Slightly crisp, just how I like it. I want a puppy."
2,"Wow, now I can hear how bad my music is","Before, listening to my cruddy 80kbps music .MP3's sounded normally. But with this cable, now I can TRULY HEAR how bad my lossy-compression-scheme .mp3 library really sounds. THIS CABLE HAS DESTROYED ME!!1!"
4,The Grays,"I ordered the Denon AKDL1 Dedicated Link Cable, and enthusiastically awaited its arrival. Though I had requested second-day delivery, I was surprised to see the strangely colored, bright lights coming from my back yard at 3:00 in the morning. My dog was peeing himself, under the coffee table; I thought that he was as excited as I was that the product had arrived. I opened the back door, to accept the delivery. I noticed that the crickets had all stopped chirping. Things get pretty vague at this point. I remember feeling like I was being drawn upward. I was in a white room, being strapped to a metal table. Gray creatures with large eyes were all around me. They showed me the Denon AKDL1 Dedicated Link Cable. Then, I remember them doing - things - to me with it ... terrible things. After that, I remember waking up in my bed. My Denon AKDL1 Dedicated Link Cable was lying neatly coiled up beside me. The cable works great, by the way."
2,Manufacturer Needs to Fix Odd Glitch,"I'm typing this review to let Denon know that this cable has a significant problem with wiring. For some reason, ever since I've started using this cable, my computer speakers have been projecting the sounds of dying children! I'm not saying this is a bad thing, but maybe Denon should stop my dark past from coming back to haunt me?Cons-Hefty Price-Caused Flashbacks to Prison-Has Burned Macaulay Culkin's Voice Into My BrainPros-Great Sound Quality-Raspy Voices Come Through Better Than Ever-Still Better Than Monster"
3,holding out for diamond cable,"I agree with the silver cable reviewer, however, I'm holding out for the Denon diamond link cable, grown synthetically in a vacuum chamber, squeezed and heated like the center of the sun. Denon will grow that special polarized diamond stranded link cable, braided like a 9 year old girls ponytail, and cover it with pure mink woven fur, allowing even clearer ones and zeros to be transmitted."
1,hahahaha........hahahahaha,hahahahahaha..............hahahahahahaha.............hahahahahahahahahahahahahaha........hahahahahahahahahahahahahaha.......hahahahahah
1,I want to sell you my wood,"Well, I wasnt impressed at all and will stick to using my trusty wooden cable for a sound with more character.This is just a fad, believe me.My wooden cables are available on ebay for $8,888"
1,Ability to tow cars,"After getting this cable I have thrown away my old tow cable. Instead I have equipped my cars with network jacks on the front and rear bumpers and use this cable to tow them. Make sure you get network jacks with 10,000 LB tensile strength."
3,Rebranded Product,"Cables are great, but if you peel back the carbon nanotube braided wrap (do NOT inhale fibers when doing this) you will see that these are actually re-branded Aperture Science Laboratories ASL-971 cables with some slight change to the in-woven flux casing. You'll hear audiophiles blather on and on about how dendritic casing enhances the flux directionality with dramatic tonal result. Honestly, I don't hear that much difference. I purchased these as a replacement of the Aperture Science version (which, it should be noted, cost $12.85 less) and noticed no improvement. In fairness, the rest of my system is great, but not a full-blown audiophile rig like the one they demo cabling with at Best Buy. Anyway, the cable is fine, but no better than the Aperture Science version."
1,Skeptics lose out,"For years my music sounded plain. The strings did not shimmer. The soundstage was narrow, confined, compressed. The music had an analytical feel, perhaps because it's all digital, and digital is not musical.The problem, I decided was that my bits were not musical. It's hard to say why. I suspect that the bits had too many odd harmonics, and not enough even harmonics.This cable apparently filters the bits to create more pleasing harmonics.Is $500 a lot to pay for pleasing harmonics?"
3,fixed my toyota,Great news for Toyota owners. I used this cable to fix the sticking gas pedal problem. Well worth the price. I now drive the DC beltway without fear plus my car radio has never sounded better.
1,It changed my Poppa,Please don't sell my Poppa another one of these cords. He hits Momma with it. She stays in the sewing room all the time now. He makes me sleep in his room every night since he got that cord.
1,Denon - BAD DOG,"After seeing the disgraceful overpricing of this generously $10 cable, I looked at Denon's own website.I'm not sure whether they're living up to their motto:""Simply put, anything that does not provide more passion, improve performance or enhance the user experience does not belong in a Denon.""If they don't take these off the market, I will never look at a Denon anything again. Period. As consumers, we should make it a point to not be swindled and have our intelligence insulted. That said, some idiots probably just needed to be shown the dotted line. They deserve their fate."
1,Rubbish,I tried listening to a lossless Midi file using these cables and it sounded awfulso went back to MP3 using my old cables not really worth the money
3,They're good but not as good as...,"Oh course I used the Denon cables, they're OK and I think they're fine for noddy tasks like hooking up printers and routers to other routers, but to really turn cabling into an art form you need to by Pear Anjou cables!A pair of 12 foot P.A. speaker cables will set you back a small sum of around $7000, a mere snip, not just nearer to JC, but actually a prime spot next to the Lord himself, with a lazy boy recliner and Mary herself massaging those cares away....( I am dealy serious! Pear Anjou cables really are $7000 for a pair of 12 foot speaker cables, don't believe me look 'em up in Google. )"
1,Denon can no longer be trusted,"I have never seen such hype in all my life. Digital is Digital, there is no such thing as to the quality of the ones and zeros getting through. The only necessary element is that the connection is clean enough to have them get through. I have bought three receivers from Denon and I am sorry to see someone I trusted turn to lies and deceit. I will never do business with them again nor should you. I would consider this cable only if you can buy it used for $5.00 because that's all it's worth."
3,I need.,"No, no, no, no, no. This sucker's electrical. But I need a nuclear reaction to generate the 1.21 gigawatts of electricity I need."
1,Snake Oil,"You would be better off purchasing a bridge in Brooklyn, than buying this cable. Actually, if the former sounds appealing to you, let me know. I know a guy...Digital signals by definition are as steady stream of 1's and 0's. Any cable that transmits those ones and zero's at ALL is indistinguishable from any other such cable. There is no difference in the ""purity"" of a 1 or a 0. It is either one or the other, you can't have a digital signal that transmits *almost* a 1.Search Amazon for any standard Cat-5 cable and you'll save yourself $495 on a product that will be *just* as good as this one. Give the difference to charity or spend it on something truly worthwhile. Needless to say, I'll be very careful to never purchase any Denon products. They really should be ashamed of themselves."
2,Small wang,"As I have a very small wang, I needed this cable to boost my mojo with the ladies and it worked."
1,Oh Dear Lord,"Did Monster buy out Denon, because this product is simply praying on those people who have far too much money and far too little grey matter. It's sad that Amazon even offers a product that is so blatantly dishonest that it would claim to be worth $499."
1,Seriously LMAO!,"Note that 32% of the people who view this item buy the $1.75 cable - saving themselves $498.25! You can buy a pretty good receiver for that kind of smack.I'd note that ""there is a sucker born every minute"" but clearly Denon knows this. IMO their target customer would buy a Ferrari to use the door latch as a bottle opener."
1,Do not taunt the AKDL1,"Potential warning to other users:I made the mistake of taunting the AKDL1.I am a battered shell of a man.Though, I must admit, I do appreciate the crisp highs and thundering lows."
1,Poor bungee cords....,"I purchased this bungee cord because it matched the basket on my bicycle. However, it is missing the hooky things on the ends and I had to tie it to the handlebars. Very poor planning on Denon's part.Bottom line: I cannot recommend."
3,Be careful with fluoropolymer anti-aging properties,"CAUTION! This cable is fine if you use just one at a time. We had one on our system for several months and experienced no adverse effects; in fact we had never felt better.But one week when I was away on a business trip, my wife bought a second one and hooked it up to the same system. When I spoke to her on the phone that evening, she was already giggling like a schoolgirl. I knew then something was wrong! By the time I got home, I found only a preschool girl, living on graham crackers from the cupboard and wiping her hands on the cat.Only then did I full realize the terrible power of the fluoropolymer insulation's anti-aging properties. Thank goodness I got home in time! But now I've got a good 15 years to wait before my wife is old enough to have sex with again. But I threw one of the cables out, and keep the other one under my mattress, so at least I'll still be young enough to enjoy it when that day finally comes."
2,It doesn't eliminate the effects of vibration,"""Connector and cable structure designed to thoroughly eliminate adverse effects from vibration""Well, I used it in my car to replace the distributor cable but the connector fell out and the engine wouldn't run so I sent it back.-dk"
1,Jitter suppresion is far too effective.,"The item worked faultlessly for six months. All jitter and vibration was fully suppressed. Unfortunately, unbeknown to me, the vibrations are stored in the blue sheathing. A fault developed after 6 months leading to the release of the stored energy. This provoked a small earthquake which has destroyed my house. Denon have refused to take responsibility. Would not buy again."
3,Don't Doubt it's Abilities,"This cable was very dedicated. I have not seen such dedication from a cable in many years. Sometimes it was a little TOO dedicated, however. When I wanted to disconnect it, it first yelled at me, then pleaded that I should let it do its job. It seems to like compliments."
3,This cable is for the good of the few.. or the one.,"My best friend and I hooked up this Denon cable to my hi-fi system. Unfortunately my little sister, just before being grounded, turned on the CD player before me and my bud were ready. We tried to make it to the couch but the wave of incredible audio clarity enveloped us like an exploding nebula, I've never heard a Genesis CD sound so beautiful and yet be so terrified at the same time. My best friend sacrificed himself going behind the stereo system to reroute power to the out of phase amplifier. I buried my friend in a coffin the shape of a Star Trek branded MP3 player.To boldly go where no audio has gone before.."
3,Lasted only 6 months!,"THE GOOD NEWS:These things aren't cheap but they control jitter and vibration better then any other cable under $10,000.00THE BAD NEWS:I'm on my second cable as the first one only lasted six months! After three months vibration and jitter were coming back and the clarity was gone. After just six months it sounded like I was using Monster Cables! YIKES!!!RECOMMENDATION:You're going to need to replace this cable every so often so buy two now and save on the shipping."
3,I want my money back,"I got these cables to pull my Audi out of the ditch with Jed' pick-up, and they broke all up on the first pull. I knows it wasn't cause he was drunk and popped the clutch, these cables jest aint no good."
2,"Amazing sound, but other issues","Sound is phenomenal, but that's expected - It's Denon's finest cable, after all.Every morning at 8am, my receiver turns on and wakes me up, I then feel a compulsion to head over to the stereo rack and turn the audio on.After an unfortunate accident, I ended up crippled, and wasn't able to turn the receiver on. A bear broke through my door and turned it on for me.Causality still freaks me out."
1,Disappointed Gamer,"The Denon AKDL1 Dedicated Link Cable did NOT improve my ""Legends of Zelda"" gaming experience. :-("
1,Digital.....,"Why would you pay this much for an ethranet cable? CAT/6 is the exact same no matter who you buy it from, you can get a cable from radio shack for $10 that would do the exact same thing.....it is all digatal, meaning the signal can't be any better than it was to begin with...it doesn't degrade over length like analogue."
1,Its a Cat5 cable!!!!!!,"All it is, is a Cat5e cable with a mesh cover and shinny plastic ends why would any one spend $500 on a cat cable? FYI for $500 you can get 2000 ft of cat6 or 4 times the amount to wire an entire house with 4 Ethernet jacks in each room. Note to self put a mesh sleeve that's pointless over cat cable and add shinny ends and idiots will buy it."
1,Not pre worn in,"For $500 I would have expected these cables to be worn in. They aren't. The procedure for pre use wear in of digital cables is significantly different to analog cables. They should be worn in for a period of 24 hours in each direction. Use a unidirectional protocol! _Never_ use TCP for wearing in digital cables, as TCP uses return packets for acknowledging, causing interference in the uplink channel being pre worn. Use UDP or ICMP (no ping) for wearing. Preferable use a payload of 64Kb with a datapacket consisting of consecutive 1's and 0's to settle the electrons. After 24 hours, reverse the cable and repeat. Always make sure that the cable is connected to a sender and a receiver, as Layer 2 will prevent data transmission if there is no positive ARP response from the receiver.This process is quite delicate and difficult, and I would have expected it to be performed by the manufacturer for this pricetag."
1,It's full of stars!,"If Denon had captured the Divine light of creation and distiled it into 1.5 meters of ultramegaradioactive copper, it could not have been better than this cable. Just holding the packaging it comes in, I can see distant galaxies and, though you may not believe it, hear what the aliens there are thinking. THAT is how good this cable is. Just thinking about it brings tears to my eyes. Honestly, looking at it is better than foreplay. You feel wracking orgastic shivers just touching it. I just know that zeros and ones will achieve true integer perfection when they travel this cable. But I'm afraid to actually install it. I might die.Denon has, in marketing this, permanently entered the rarified realm of vendors inhabited by the likes of Machina Dynamica. I honestly can't think of a better way to express my feelings on this product, than that. I'm breathless to see what they want to sell us next!"
1,Amazingly powerful. Stunningly clear.,"While the production quality of this cable, along with the little arrows that help me(and the music) understand where the sound is going, is mind-boggling - What I found most impressive is that this cable actually turned my binary digital audio devices into TRINARY digital audio devices. All the people saying that it's just 1's and 0's don't understand how revolutionary this cable is. IT UPSCALES YOUR DIGITAL SPECTRUM TO ALLOW FOR 2's!!! Any true audiophile knows that 2's are where the upper-order harmonicas are to be found in high quality digital audio."
4,Moves data faster,"One of the unmentioned qualities of these cables is the reduced latency of the signal. Normal copper cables pass signals at about half the speed of light, but these puppies pass the signal at up to 3/4ths of lightspeed! This means that your data arrives faster, and since the Ethernet protocol involves collision detection, backoff, and retransmission this added speed means YOUR data is more likely to go ahead of competing data! Further, if there is no issue with other data sources, your data arrives 100s of picoseconds faster than with other cables. This can be important for gamers in multi-player situations! Or even for folks who just hate to wait for their data to arrive.Marked down 1 star because it still won't let you do the Kessel run in less than 12 parsecs."
1,BLACK HOLE WARNING!,BUYER BEWARE!The Denon AKDL1 cable is a hazard! I am writing this review with my left hand while my right is being spaghettified. After mis-reading the 300-page users manual and plugging this thing in the wrong way a catastrophic gravity well tore into my basement. I have only moments to live. PLEASE read the manual carefully. Tell my wifefbvbn 516333
1,"The truth about ""superior heat resistance, weather resistance, and anti-aging properties""","So I shelled out $500 for the Denon AKDL1 Dedicated Link Cable due to its ""superior heat resistance, weather resistance, and anti-aging properties."" I've had it on me ever since, letting it dangle around my neck. Now granted, it has raised my status. People stare at me, no doubt impressed and even envious that I have the Denon cable. But ""superior heat resistance, weather resistance, and anti-aging properties""? Not on your life. I walk in the rain with the cable around my neck and I still get wet. Yesterday, a hot July day down here in Florida, I felt so confident in the ""superior heat resistance"" of the cable that I walked around dressed as if I was on an Arctic expedition. Oddly enough I still sweated and passed out. So much for ""superior heat resistance."" As for the ""anti-aging properties"", well I am still getting older with each passing day. What a gyp."
2,Deceptive photograph,The photo shows the product distinctly SMILING. Mine came out of the package with more of a wry grimace. I am returning the item -- I like my dedicated link cables expensive AND attractively smiling. Sheesh.
1,False Advertising!,"This product touts its anti-aging properties, but when I use it, I still find myself growing old. Why, Denon, Why?"
2,Don't get water on it!,"After reading the reviews, I was excited to let my new cable bring me into hyperspace, and possibly play some music. After plugging it in, the shockwave rippled through my house and caused some water to spill on it. Before I even realized what I had done, the cable began to spasm. Small demon spawn cables began shooting out of it and terrorizing the neighborhood. I read the box but couldn't find a warning about the water spilling, that was until I vaguely remembered the old guy that sold it to me saying something weird in Alienese. I Googled the gargle he blurted out and found that he did warn me, albeit in a third world dead language. His welcome call still haunts me ""Bonjour"", crazy dead language. I had to give this one star as it destroyed the neighborhood.Edit: I found that sending this message over the same cable, it automatically added a star to it's rating. I didn't give it 2 stars, it did that itself!"
1,An investment for the future,"This beautiful hand-crafted cable has been lovingly assembled atom by atom by a dedicated artist.Each cable is unique - for customer convenience, arrows point to the 5 nm x 5 nm signature of its creator at the end of the cable.Like that of an original Picasso, the value of this cable is only likely to increase over time, making it a safe investment in these troubled times.To preserve the cable's pristine condition for future resale at auctions, remember never to plug the cable into an appliance!If you are not just purchasing as an investment but want to take pride in your possession, you may wear it to state dinners and receptions."
5,Firmware Update Needed,"I got myself one of these for my birthday recently. Well, it wasn't my birthday, but it sure felt like it when the cable arrived. I was so ecstatic that I couldn't wait to try it out. I plugged the cable in and turned my music on but it didn't work! I couldn't hear my music! I was sure it was something wrong with my other equipment, so I did some research online. It turns out you have to update the cable's firmware to get it to work with certain other audio equipment. After installing the patch cable works perfectly!"
2,Inferior plugs,"Bargain hunter beware! Although theAudioQuest class 5 optical cable - TosLink plugs 1.5m (4.92')is $80 more than the AKDL1, it's the best $80 you'll ever spend. The problem with the AKDL1 is its poorly designed plugs: in extensive testing, I found them uncomfortable and difficult to clean. Yes, the plug levers are rounded, which helps, but my advice would be to invest in a separate, high-quality lever such as theLincoln Industrial 1133 16 Ounce 2 Way Loading Lever Action Grease Gun with 18-Inch Whipfor those occasions when the plug proves difficult to extract."
3,Perfection,"Is it possible that these cables are the earthly embodiment of perfection? I though so.Like an idiot I didn't follow the instructions that came with the cable. Instead, I ""accidentally"" ground them up in a blender along with a pile of Monster cables. What came out was a green, glowing, runny substance. I wasn't sure what I could do with it, so I threw it out of house and onto the garden. What happened, no one could have expected.Apparently most of the ooze found its way onto a family of turtles. It began to physically change them. It has been two weeks now and I have four teenage turtles in my house constantly breaking things with their martial arts. I'm about out of pizza and would like Denon to explain how these seemingly flawless cables could have caused such a problem. I read all of the warnings and didn't find anything in them about not blending them up and pouring it on turtles. I would like a full refund, or at least, Denon to cover my pizza bill."
2,Wormholes....2!!,"Let me just say that just like everyone else, I also had problems with slipstreams opening where I didn't want them to open. I too was in my basement when one opened up and sucked my cat in. A few minutes later my cat appeared in the washing machine(which was on) and died. I also had problems with the feature in which people appear nude. I don't like seeing Burt Reynolds nude in the original Longest Yard. And as I went to pick up my A1 steak sauce instead of seeing Jesus normal, I saw him nude....This cable is not for children or people who own animals....Dodge this cable."
1,I told him not to leave it laying around.,Please don't buy this cable. The Dr left it and we're in desperate contact with the store to retrieve it forthwith.Men! He's always leaving that stupid screwdriver all over England. Now this?!?!
5,The struggle of Darkness and Light won by Denon.,"In the struggle for Darkness and Light, the human condition dictates that there can be no clear winners or losers. Pure forms of evil and good are human interpretations for theories beyond mortal comprehension. The Denon AKDL1 has turned modern agnostic thinking on its head by proving that through producing a cable manufactured from a copper of such purity, that evil cannot possibly exist. This, in turn proves that God exists ergo Heaven."
1,Pricey but worth it,"At first I was pretty sure these cables were priced a bit too high. Comparable digital cables of this length and quality can be found for less. But what makes the Denon AKDL1 Dedicated Link Cable so special is that it transmits a digital signal much more efficiently and cleanly than other digital cables. We all know that digital information (unlike analog) is merely 1's and 0's. So an audio stream coming through a normal digital cable might look like this ""1101 0010 1111 0100 1001"". But the Denon AKDL1 Dedicated Link Cable applies ""additive compression"". This makes for a much more efficient signal transmission without a loss of fidelity. There are two ""additive compression"" options -- Low and High.Example:Normal cable - ""1101 0010 1110 1001""Denon AKDL1 cable on LOW - ""3 1 3 2""Denon AKDL1 cable on HIGH - ""9""You'd be hard pressed to find many cables that can do this. For my money, this cable is a special treat."
1,Lies,To write this kind of nonsense about a simple cable displays marketers utterly without moral convictions. I may never buy another Denon product.
2,Error #69,I hooked up a laptop to my router using this cable and I get this 'error 69 unable to couple with peer' message. I seem to remember that from my days programming DEC mini-computers but I don't remember what caused it or what to do about it.
1,Wow!,I received this cable the other day and plugged in it. I couldn't believe what I was hearing and feeling. My bowels started to shift and my tummy started to rumble. A few minutes later I made a big doodie all over myself. I can't believe it. This cable saved me from getting colonic irrigation. Wowee!
1,Need female-to-female connector,"My Denon receiver is 3 meters away from my DVD player, so I bought two of these. Unfortunately, I only had a regular, straight-through female to female coupler. I don't hear any difference with my $1000 cable investment. Denon needs to come out with purified copper connectors."
1,Not dedicated.,"Major failure. I caught my ""dedicated"" cable in a ""moment of lust"" halfway up a Denon marketer. Lies. All lies."
1,"Alas, I was expecting better.","For 400$, I would have expected the inner wiring to be made of pure gold or even carbon superconductors... But alas, it is only made out of copper. Needless to say, I quickly returned the standard cable to the store!"
5,So I received my cable today.,"Did anyone else get one of these without even ordering it? I just received mine in the mail today, and the package was postmarked 11/13/2012. I don't know what that's supposed to mean.I'm off to go try it out, I'll leave a review after I do."
1,This cable is $4.99 at most Computer Stores,"Just walk in any computer store and say, ""I need a 5 foot Cat5 cable,"" and you'll get a cable with the exact same ""digital quality"" for $5.If you want to mix it up a bit, you can try, ""I need a 5 foot cat6 cable."" Now you might have to pay between $1 and $10 more for such a ""limited edition"" cat6 cable, but you will get the same ""digital quality"".And to those who were being sarcastic by giving it a higher rating:For every one of you who rates it as a ""5 star,"" it takes 5 people rating it as a ""1 star"" to get it back down to 1 star more than it deserves."
1,High Quality 0's and 1's,"It's unfortunate that a company would sell a piece of CAT-5E for this much money. There are no such things as pristine 0's and 1's. I understand the 'audiophile' philosophy, but this is ridiculous. Digital signals do not get better with gold plating, or by paying enormous amounts of money. Digital signals are digital signals.CAT-5 cables also relies on balanced lines which means that the signal is transmitted down the twisted pairs as inverses of each other. This technique effectively cancels out interference over CAT-5E without the $495 markup.If you are looking for a ""AKDL1 Dedicated Link Cable"", buy yourself a 2 meter CAT-5E cable and pocket the rest."
1,One star is one too many for this insane pricetag.,"Digital cables made up of unshielded twisted pairs (better known as UTP) are designed to cancel their own interference WITHOUT NEEDING SHIELDING of any kind. This is by design, to save on manufacturing costs and increase potential throughput. In other words, with this type of cable, it's all about practicality and cheapness of manufacturing cost. This product is a textbook example of a snake-oil product. If you feel inclined to buy one, please also consider buying a certain bridge I have for sale in the Brooklyn region."
2,Odd side effects,"I put these cables in my system hoping for the best but I didn't notice ANY sound improvement. If I owned some giant metal fighting robots these cables would be ideal for interconnecting them to the Master Processor, but since I do not, they are of no use to me. WOULD NOT BUY AGAIN."
4,Nice to have a teacher who has experience with breast cancer,"I practiced yoga for about 5 years before being diagnosed with breast cancer and undergoing chemo, mastectomy, and radition. My yoga teacher trained with Esther Myers and lent me this video. I found it very worthwhile to have her guide me through the poses that are helpful for the specific issues resulting from breast cancer treatment. And, I needed a much gentler practice than I was used to, so having a tape to follow was very helpful. Esther clearly had a huge level of both knowledge of yoga and compassion for women undergoing treatment. This tape is useful for anyone who has had breast cancer treatments and especially if you have no previous yoga experience."
3,psychedelic spliced together songs of varying array,i feel this is s definitive collection of the pre wutang clan era familiar to def jam fans world wide. The various artists compiled together make for a fun and reminescent album.
3,"Another good story about Thomas, but not long enough.","I purchased this particular Thomas the Tank Engine book for my grandchildren, as they have enjoyed the stories about Thomas in the past. However, if I could have seen and read this book in a book store, I probably would not have purchased it. While the graphics are extremely good (as usual), and the music is quite cute (and appropriately quiet), the story is just too short at 10 pages. In addition, I am always looking for books that are interesting for my grandchildren, but yet teach them new words. Unfortunately, this book just is too short to meet that criteria for me to rate it any higher than 3 stars."
1,SUCKS HAIR INTO MOTOR !! SO annoying !!!,"I dont understand the great reviews of others. This hairdryer is less than average to me.Cons :It does not get very hot.does not have a strong blast.Slow to dry my hairSucks my hair into the vent on the side and my hair gets stuck in the motor.Pros :feels heavy and substantial.But the REALLY annoying thing is that it sucks my long hair into the vent on the side of the dryer and my hair gets stuck in the motor!!!!!!!!I have to cut my hair out with scissors. Yeah, OUCH.Who puts the vent on the side, anyway????Dealbreaker. This machine is going back to the store."
2,Heavy and awkward,"I was surprised by how heavy and unwieldy this cheery yellow bird is. I've been spoiled by lighter dryers and find my arms feeling weary and unwilling to spend time styling. Not Conair's fault, it was my bad for thinking it would be lighter than it looks. It's getting shoved to the back of a junk drawer. Rats."
5,Love it!,"Great blowdryer, have been buying it for years! They die for me after about a year or so, so I have them replaced under manuf warranty which is so quick! I can't seem to get away from this dryer, love it!"
5,Great Product,"It is colorful, strudy with a nice, long, strudy cord, and quality attachments. However, the box states 4 Speed/Heat Settings. I was anticipating a warm setting, but there is only a hot setting and a cool setting. I really wanted a ""Warm"" setting. If I had to do it all over, I would make sure the product stated that it had a warm setting."
2,"Good hair dryer, if you don't mind buying a new one in 6 months.","I purchased this hair dryer less than 6 months ago. I use it every other day at most. This morning I woke up, showered, started to blow dry my hair and discovered that the heating element had gone out and all I can get now is cold air. Considering that I paid $40 for this dryer at my local Sally Beauty Supply I was mad because I have had way cheaper ones that lasted way longer."
3,Yellowbird,"I purchased this product because quite a few of the Youtube vloggers I follow use/recommended it. I liked that it dried my hair well and that it had 4 different settings from cool to hot, but I found that if you hold it by the nozzle end like I do, it heats up ALOT! I used it primarily on the warm setting applying the tension method to my (4b/4c) hair and it was fine. I accidentally had it on the hot setting initially and that was too much heat for my hair. There's not much that's special about this dryer, but overall, it's a powerful, not too pricey option if you are looking for a professional style hairdryer."
3,USB card reader with Smartmedia,Beware when you use USB card reader to read and write to your smartmedia. I used one to load the images from my camera. I made a mistake by erasing the files by the card reader. Now my smartmedia card no longer works on the camera although the card still works fine as a removable drive on the card reader. The camera would not reformat the card and shows card error. There is no warning anywhere in the user's manual. What a waste of money considering the price of the card.
3,Rare Olympus Smart Card,"Not many of these older memory cards available for purchase as I have recently discovered in having to replace a mortally wounded card. It happens! Replacement costs are spectacular! Olympus Digital Camera C-4040ZOOM (and others) are much too useful, even as utility cameras, to sit around, unused, due to dearth of memory cards. Digital camera ownership is much too expensive to justify one's falling prey to exhorbitant replacement costs due to predatory obsolescense practices. Olympus is here taking blatent advantage of its customers. I suppose that from this point on I must carefully venture into other photo markets to seek-out (hopefully), lesser predatory venues. I am now on my third Olympus digital camera, the last two digital SLR's, wondering now to what extent Olympus will support these expensive purchases over their predictable lifetimes."
4,replacing after format lost,"I am replacing a 128MB card after one of two I owned lost its format. I had the card in an Olympus P440 photo printer (using a PCMCIA adapter). While printing, I lost power to the printer. When I powered everything up again, some of the image data was lost and errors were diaplyed on the printer. When I reinserted the card into my Olympus 3040 camera, it diplayed a card error and refused to reformat with the tool icon. So I threw the card away. This is the only problem I have had in 2+ years, but it seems like a serious design flaw for a card that should have only been open for a read function."
4,be careful how you use it,"I love my Olympus digital cameras (I now have two), and I enjoy having lots of room on the card and not having to think whether or not I've got the right card to do panorama shots. However, I use an external PCMCIA card reader to copy the picture files to my computer, and I recently made the mistake of copying some files from the computer back onto the smartmedia card. After that the camera would not recognize the card, and Olympus is unwilling to offer assistance. They say my card just got corrupted and I need to buy a new one."
3,some problems,"I bought two of these cards a little less than a year agoand they worked great until recently. I had 160 images onone card and when I tried to upload them to my Dell (whichI have done with success many times) I got""Disk is not formatted."" I tried uploading to an IBM PCand got the same message. When I put the card into an HPprinter (that I have had success with in the past) I got""Error on card."" I was pretty depressed by this since theimages were taken over several weeks for a documentationproject. As a last effort, I tried uploading the images toan HP computer, and that worked fine - so they were saved.I tossed the defective card. I had in no way mistreated it.This experience has taught me to upload my pictures morefrequently - you could lose a lot of valuable images."
5,The Biggest Little Card,"I own an Olympus C-2040 Zoom digital camera which comes with a 8MB SmartMedia card. When first turned on, it comes up in HQ mode (1600 x 1200 standard JPEG) and the number of photos that can be stored is 13. This equates to about one-half roll of film.I plugged in the 128MB SmartMedia card and it shows that it will store 257 images in HQ mode. This equates to more than 10 rolls of 24 exposure film. Ten rolls of film... that's about what I shoot on a normal vacation. Plus, by using the Olympus SmartMedia card the panorama mode is always available."
2,Olympus 128 MB Smartmedia,"I was really happy to be able to get a larger media card for my apparently aging digital camera. Olympus didn't have any for this particular camera and suggested this seller. It was in stock and arrived nearly as advertized. I received the package within a package. Everything was soaked to the gills. Luckily the media card was in a plastic pouch or it would have been ruined. In the end the media card was just fine but everything else looked as if it had been swimming for days, before finally being found and repackaged and shipped. The two stars are for the little plastic pouch. Thanks!"
5,Awesome product,"Great transaction with an awesome company. SmartMedia card is great. The lithium batteries didnt fit my camera, unfortunately. I was issued a refund with no hassle. Would definitely do business with this company again."
4,great puzzle!,"Nice quality puzzle that both my children love spreading out across the floor and assembling. Even my son, who just turned 3 can do this without help, and his older sister enjoys it as well."
4,"Ok, but needs more substance",I love watching or reading about the Naval sea battles and some of the people were the leaders at the time of these event. I wish there are more DVDs like this. Some of the Admirales you really don't hear about. This is good though.
2,Rehashed War Department Footage,'Warships: Leyte Gulf to Tokyo Bay' simply has a handful of old WW2 training/news films such as 'Your Ship' on it. If that wasn't bad enough they didn't bother to clean up the footage or the audio and it has numerous skips and other issues with both the audio and the film itself. Somewhat comical is that each clip has a dire 'do not copy' warning attached to it. Isn't this stuff all public domain?! Some of the footage IS indeed interesting but the narration is all but useless unless you are studying the old training films themselves. Anyone looking for some historical perspective or analysis on WW2 naval operations can look elsewhere as there is none here at all. For die hard naval fans only or those interested only in the footage itself.
3,Funny defects,"I've got it today. I can live with everything for less than $60, but there is something I have to say. The biggest knife has a very strange defect I have never experienced before. It's empty inside of the handle (this is how these knives are build, they are saving metal and making them lighter), and a Chinese worker left something inside. So when you take the knife it makes rattling noise. Very fanny and doesn't say anything good about assembly control. I'll probably keep it but it's the last product I ever buy from Bodum."
1,Bad Presentation,"Seems like the knives was storage like 2 years. Ugly and bad presentation, the knives was dirty."
3,"Looks great, but lacking where it matters.","In the looks department these knives beat out some of the greatest. They are reminiscent of Globals. When it comes time to perform though, these knives lack the edge to cut it. Bodum advertises the finest Japanese steel, so who knows, these might be great after a good sharpening."
1,The knives look like factory rejects: dull blades and are stained,"These knives, with ""Japanese steel"" are made in China. And since Japan hasn't made steel for some time, I suspect the steel is also made in China. Not that this is a bad thing, just that the marketing description is somewhat misleading.I am OK with that. The part that disappointed me was that the blades are dull as a butter knife. I will take them to get sharpened and hopefully they will then perform as advertised.If I had it to do over again, I'd pass on this knife set and this alleged ""deal"" from Amazon."
1,Do not buy at any price!!,"I bought this product because it was on sale for $24. I read the reviews and most of them were negative, but I thought how bad could they be for that price. They arrived with smudges on the knives and they looked dull and dirty. I wanted to wash them immediately, so I put them in the sink with some water. By the time I came back to wash them, the knives had RUST. Rust that I couldn't wash off. All of this happened within 8 hours of receiving the knives. I wouldn't want the knives even if they were free! You can buy better quality stuff at your local gas station."
2,noisy and hot,"IT looks very nice, but the fan noise and the overheating were disturbing. Averatec techsupport was helpful, but cannot solve an inherent problem."
3,Not too shabby,"If you're just looking to dub Bring the Pain and be on with it, don't pay full price. However, if you're more than just an armchair listener, even by an ounce, you'll enjoy this one. Puff and enjoy the beats and layers, or down some caffeine and hit the punching bags. It's a great album to listen to prior to a basketball game where you're planning on kicking some major booty -- each shot you block and point you score you'll hear I bring the pain in your head."
3,THE METH,one of the illest styles around.slightly dissapointing release but ah well.i miss the good old meth-him and 2pac got me into hip hop.
3,MAY DAY,"THIS ALBUM WAS FAR FROM A CLASSIC IN MY OPINION LETS TALK ABOUT THE SOUND QUALITY OF THE ALBUM.WHEN I HEARD BISCUTS THE BEAT WAS DOPE BUT HIS MIC WAS CUT DOWN ROBBING ME OF WHAT HE WAS SAYING. THE SONGS THAT SAVE THIS ALBUM WAS PROTECT YA NECK,MR.SANDMAN,RELEASE YO DELF. OH YEAH I FORGOT THE METHOD MAN REMIX. THIS ALBUM IS NOT METHOD MANS BEST WORK."
3,Overrated.,"Really was a disappointment. I know people love Meth, but this album really did not live up to the expectations, especially when you compare it to the other original Wu solo projects."
5,TOP NOTCH QUALITY,"This is a great CD. Method Man comes out flying in all of his tracks. All the songs on this CD are great. Bring the Pain, All I Need, What the Blood Clot, Meth vs. Chef, and Realese Yo' Delf are some of the best tracks I'veever heard. It is such a great CD. I've lost a little respect for Method Man recently, but his original CD is great. It ranks right up there with the best of the Wu-Albums. It's not #1 in my opinion, but it is still great. Buy this CD, it is worth it."
4,METHS DOPE BEGININGS,This is one of my favorite Wu Tang albums next to GZA Liquid Swords Enter the 36 Chambers and a host of others to numerous to list here. This was the album that first got me hooked on the Wu Tang sound. Soud wise this is dark futuristic and grimy Concept Hiphop It is pointless to try and pin down what style this is because with every release Rza Never ceases to amaze with his off the wall prodution style that is decades ahead of its time and this album was no exception. Needless to say this record has a very original Style and sound that was absent from many of the Hiphop groups of that era. The recording quality is what I love most about this record it sounds like it was recorded inside someones closet and it really gives it that raw as ---- feel. The lyrics are abstract and dark and fit in well with the grimey futuristic production. This was a dope effort from meth definitely his best. A 4 MIC Classic
4,Tical Part.1 Pretty Tight.,"Meth's first album is good,but Meth rapping skills is tight. Don't get me wrong, I like the album, tracks 3,6,8,9&13 are tight and Carlton Fisk is a great newcomer. But the flaw is the cd is too damn short. We want more Meth!"
5,Classic Meth Brings The Pain,"Classic I love every song. Meth has never really been the same since this album, but I do think Tical 2 was a classic also. This album is dark and grimy. The baseline for Biscuits will definitely rattle your trunk. Tical is ok. Bring The Pain doesnt need any comment. What The Blood Clot is classic. Meth vs Chef one of my favs I think Meth blew Chef away on that one. Other classics are Release Yo' Delf and to me Stimulation. I wished Meth still made albums like this but that was a different time back then for hip hop. Oh yeah I forgot the biggest hit All I Need is on here but if you want the remixes with Mary J Blige they sell that separately for about 4 bucks."
3,Opps,"Listen, Meth is one of my favorite, if not my favorite rapper and so it really pains me to write this review but I have to say it. The songs are tight but the production is whack and half the songs have beats so loud you can't hear Meth rapping...he almost sounds like a whisper..I wish they would re-release this album with better quality production because the tracks are dope and Meth really knows how to spit it like crazy but he's overshadowed by the lack of quality behind the production. This lies all in the hands of the track editor how didn't know how to balance things up and clean up the tracks..and some may like the raw feeling to the tracks but I prefer a clean sound...Sorry guys if this review upsets the die hard fans, but that said I am a die hard fan and I have to speak the truth."
3,Method Man could have done a lot better....,"Tical was as highly anticipated as Snoops Doggystyle. unfortunately this wasn't a classic album by no means. Rza used his throw away beats for the production to say the least. Lyrically Meth held it down and tracks like ""Bring the Pain"", ""What the Bloodclot"" and the grammy winning ""All I Need"" show that this mc can make a hit...The problem with Tical is that there are several tracks that just sounds rushed."
5,Tiiiiccccaaalllll!!!,"I can't wait until Method Man get back to his old style of emceeing. He is starting to get into the spot light more as well. This album continues to hold me over until he drops his next one (Crystal Meth). So until then, this one is worth the purchase! TICAL!!! =D"
4,"""Swimming with the sharks now""","I pretty much gave up on what mainstream rap and hip hop have to offer. It's gotten so bad it isn't funny. What I miss in terms of the more extreme gangsta stuff is the dark jazzy grittiness so well displayed in 36 Chambers. Tical isn't the best solo album of the Wu, that would go to GZA's outstanding Liquid Swords, but it has memorable songs, great lyrics and a very dark feel. Thankfully, Release yo Delf is the only song that has female R n' B vocals(another reason why I don't like mainstream rap, too much R n' B influence). This one has been in regular rotation in my stereos since middle school."
2,2 stars on a Wu scale,"still worth buying, but not until you have36 chambersliquid swordsonly built 4 cuban linkswu-tang foreverironmanall the killarmy albumsand basically any other old wu album you can think of."
4,Choco-goodies,"Do yourself a favor guys, if your lady likes chocolate...buy these! My wife compares them to a chocolate martini in taste. I only gave it four stars because they are a little thick and my wife says the flavoring doesn't last very long. Other than that we love them!"
2,"Smells good, taste bad","I originally bought this product for my girlfriend so she can give me head. During intercourse I put the condoms on and let her put it in her mouth. Sad to say I was left with blue balls and she was left with a sore tongue. She said and I quote ""the taste is too overpowering and I can't feel my tongue."""
2,-_-,"The smell was overwhelmingly strong an suck to my hands and every thing i touched, if it smelt good and didn't give me a head ache i wouldn't mind this but the taste wasn't very good an numbed my mouth which was not pleasant. Shipping was fast an was well packaged."
5,Chocolate Frosting,"These are really quite tasty. Makes oral even more fun! They are a bit tight, so if you're large in girth, you might have a bit more pains to roll these suckers on!This is probably my favorite out of all these flavors."
2,Too small,"These condoms were okay but my girl didn't like the chocolate flavor leaving so fast and since I normally need a magnum size for my ""member"" these were too small and too tight to fit. I wouldn't buy them again unless they came in a bigger size"
2,Will use only in emergency,"Taste is Good...But the fit is not good comparing to Durex.Little small in length, still workableBut too tight and not at all enjoyable for him"
5,2nd Best of All Time!,This is 2nd to the original Chronic in my book. I wish cd's like this came out every day - it DOESNT get better than this.
2,Nothing to get excited about,"I don't know what is going on with all of the other people that reviewed this and acted like it is the best thing since soap on a roap. I am a big underground hip hop fan. Some of my favorites are Del, Dialated Peoples, Kool Keith, J5, PB Wolf, Jeru the Damaja, and Cut Chemist. All of those artists are good becuase they like to have fun and they try different things to set themselves apart from the pack. I just found Self Science to bee too boring. There is nothing about this cd that really catches your ear."
1,Toxic Cinderella Glass Slippers,"If you can smell the chemicals being emitted by these slippers than your child is breathing them in! Also the chemicals are being absorbed through the skin of your childs feet. They are made with known cancer causing chemicals. They are also manufactured over seas wher the DEQ,EPA etc; have no jurisdiction over the processes used to manufacture these slippers. My two year old daughter was given a pair and they are now hidden in the garage. Did not want to put them into a land fill until some one has analyzed the toxic emission from these horrible smeling slippers. Benzene, Poly Vinyl Chloride, all kill the liver."
3,Looks are not everything,"Talk about stink. These are cute, but please find a way to make them smell better. We simply can not abide the awful stench."
3,Cute Shoes But They Do Smell Bad!,"I bought these shoes for my 4 yr. old daughter because she really wanted them. When we got home & opened them I could not believe the smell!!!!!!! I too thought the smell would go away but the smell is very strong & I think it would take a long time for that to happen. They are very cute shoes & I want to return them because when I woke up this morning the whole downstairs stunk like those shoes!! My daughter is so upset so now I'm in search of a different Cinderella shoe. I can't believe that they would make a shoe out of this material especially for small children! I wish I would have read these reviews before I purchased them but it was not a ""planned"" purchase."
1,unsatisfied,I'm very sorry but I did not like this book at all and sent it back immidiately. I guess I expected a lot of visuals of many different artist's portraits includidng contemporaries. I think perhaps it was only my expectations of something else which caused me to find this book unsatisfactory.
4,Decent story leaves you hanging,"I enjoying reading this even though that dark subject (a sexually abusive father and others). The book is well written and interesting I just feel kinda like at the end, you want more. What happens next. It follows Debbie from youth to midway through high school, then just stops. I would have liked to know what happened next once she left her abusive house and went off on her own."
4,sickening subject - well done,I want to kill this woman's father for what he did to her.... Art reminds me very strongly of Lynda Barry.
4,If you like your blues raw & gritty,"Harmonica Shah (aka Seward Shah) blasts his way through 10 blues numbers by various artists such as Jimmy Reed, Elmore James and Earl Hooker as well as a host of self penned (some liberties here!) tunes.The backing band(s) are complementary to Shah's over the top blowin'. Tasty guitar work by Little Jr. Cannaday and Joe Mitchell along with three excellent piano men round out the sound.If you like your blues delivered in a smoky, urban dive and served up with a shot of cheap whiskey, then you will dig this CD. Listen closely to Shah's rendition of ""The Sky Is Crying"" and you'll hear him turning on his bullet mic just before he rips off a gut wrenching solo. Pure magic!"
4,It was just what i needed!,It was the right tool for what I needed. Not disappointed. The experience with the seller was good. I received what I ordered in the way I requested.
2,Too pricey,"I have mixed reviews on this Cranium product. Purchased after reading it was a ""hot toy"" for this season but found I'm rather luke-warm on it. First off, there is NO box to store this in! And the zip lock bag it comes in is a joke so be prepared to find something else to put all the parts and the SUV in. Secondly, ours doesn't always work properly. The trunk doesn't always register (even if you only put one item in and close it) and therefore says you have to try again. Thirdly, after a few rounds it becomes rather boring b/c you can quickly find out how to pack the items each time. Lastly, the price for this is way too high!I'm hoping the folks at Cranium get back on track. I bought the Sounds of Seashore Game before this one and it also is a big DUD. Don't buy that one!"
3,"An updated version of ""Perfection""","I bought this game because it reminded me of the old game Perfection. Indeed, my four year old likes racing against the clock to fit the different items in the trunk of the SUV. I just wish more items could actually fit. It is fun, but the variations of the game are limited by the amount of space in the trunk (so only so much will ever fit). My son has adapted the game by trying to fill the trunk, then place as much as he can on the roof. It keeps him occupied and happy, so no problem there! I do think the educational value of the toy (spatial relations, etc.) is less than the toy manufacturer would want you to think, but it wasn't the main reason I bought it so that fact doesn't personally bother me."
2,Broken?,"My 5 year old got this toy for Christmas. She was excited to get it, but right from the box we couldn't understand the excitement of the game. Maybe ours is broken? The trunk doesn't pop out every time. Maybe only 4 out of 10 times it actually works. Otherwise, it just starts over telling us to push the button to start packing. I am not impressed with the game. I also think for the amount of money paid, it should come with it's own storage system. Right now we have it stored in an old shoe box. Right now we have plans to return the game and pick out something different."
3,Give us a box!!,Well it is Christmas and I didn't see any type of zip lock back to store all of these pieces in. I had thought that all of the pieces would fit into the car and they do not. I can't imagine Cranium making a game without some sort of storage container. The game really is too easy and my 9 year old got bored easy with it so we made up our own rules and made it more fun.
4,Jam Pack Jam is loads of fun!,"I bought this toy as a gift for my 4 year old for him and his 6 year old brother to play. Well, the entire family got in on the action and it was lots of fun. The car is durable, but make sure you keep the enclosed bag for the cards and the items to pack or else.... Not a superior learning game but it does require some concentration and fine motor skills to pack all of the items in the trunk before time runs out. Overall, I would recommend this toy! It got lots of laughs on a rainy day."
4,I like it - and has a bit of a halloween hint to it.,"What is that guy listening to, a mega-stereo cranked up? This is ""relaxing"" sounds, not jamming music!Actually this CD is a bit fun. It has a trombone melody that sounds a little bit Halloweenish, or Disney Fantasiaish in some parts.I don't hear much of waves, although there is some along with other ocean sounds like gulls, but its not the primary sounds you'll hear, the thunder is, and the trombone, which is not constant, it's interspersed.I saw where someone on amazon had it for $29. It's not worth that. But $5 - $8 like the other ones in this series, none of which I've heard, I'd say is more in inline with it's value. (if someone thinks they need to pay $29, contact me, I'll sell you mine (all original CD & case for that much... lol ;)Note: it's just one track, 54 mins long."
1,What the ****?!,"I just received my new copy of Walking Like a Panther. No, it's no masterpiece, but I'm trying to relive my youth, so...I pop it into the player and immediately notice that I've got the radio version, completely censored!The cover says 'Explicit Lyrics'. Nowhere does it warn me that I'm buying a chopped-up PG-13 version of what I thought I was ordering.I can't even rap along because the scrambling destroys the music right along with the 'bad' words. ""I'm so bad I can suck my own -wicki-wicki-!""Very disappointed."
1,False advertising,"I ordered a CD, it was supposed to be explicit, but it was rated-pg, whereas the packaging displayed a warning label. If I wanted the CD for kids I would've went to Wal-Mart!"
5,a walk on the wild side,if you enjoy rap take a listen to cool j in his youth; he was then and is now one of the best.
5,This is an underrated album from LL Cool J,"LL put out some of the best material of his career on this ""Walking With A Panther"" album, it features some of my favorite songs like ""Jingling Baby"", ""Big Ole Butt"", ""Droppin' Em"", ""Clap Your Hands"", ""I'm That Type Of Guy"", and ""Nitro"", some people might say this is his worst effort but really it's one of the best albums in rap history, stop sleeping haters."
3,Good could have been better,"Walking with a Panther was a good cd not great. IT defiently doesent match up to Radio, and Bigger and Deffer. Like all of LL Cool J cd's it has its stand out tracks. Some good tracks include Nitro, It gets no Rougher, Jingling Baby and Change Your Ways. This is still a good OLD Skool rap cd to have in your collection. The intresting part of this cd is some of the tracks in this cd are Produced by Hank Shocklee, Keith Shocklee and Eric ""vietnam"" Sadler. These guys produced many cd's for Public Enemy. If you LL at his best get Radio and Bigger and Deffer."
4,He's that type of guy,"This is L.L. Cool J's third album. There is a lot of fine material here, but at 76 minutes it runs a bit long. If some of the weaker material had been cut and the album was brought down to about 45 minutes, it could have been a great album. Instead, it's only a very good album. Some of the standout tracks are ""Droppin' Em"", ""I'm That Type of Guy"", ""Going Back to Cali"", ""Big Ole Butt"" and ""Jingling Baby"". Fans of old school rap should dig this album."
2,CHEESEY,"This was a very disappointing album after releasing Radio and BAD(which are da bomb), he is clearly plunging into mediocrity. With the exception of Droppin 'em, 1 900 LL Cool J, Clap your hands, AND Smokin Dopin. Walking with a panther should have kept walking."
2,My brother gave to me the following opinion....,"that Hip-hop was a single, rather than LP(now CD) driven genre, and that most hip-hop CD's, have 1,2 0r if your lucky 3 great tunes on it, with the rest being fillers. Case in point, this CD.I would say that only 'It's gets no rougher' and 'Why do ya think they call it dope?'cut it, with the rest being fillers. If I remember righty at the time, this LP markeda time when many people thought that LL had fallen off, with his boasting rhymes, in a time of Public enemy, KRS One 'Knowledge of self' era. I would check out on itunes, and buy tunes that appeal."
4,The perfect book for beginners,"The book is clear, concise and comprehensive. It covers from how to get a domain name to how to accept credit card payments.I like the emphasis in formating using CSS instead html. This was a new concept for me. The author introduces java scripts and dynamic html. I missed a chapter about how to organize, and keep update the whole web site (sometimes with hundreds of web pages, pictures, icons, etc...). It was one of my first book about the topic and I really think that it's a powefull introductory book."
5,easy-reading and good,"What you'd certainly like there:- good writing style, friendly with catchy details which at the same time do not distruct you from the main idea.- focus on all aspects around the core subject - Your WebSite design and functionality - adding things as necessary yet with nothing that would be boringI'd say it's great for those people looking for a well-structured approach to the topic and also those who need first advice (beginners in Web design and intermediate ones)I'm now looking for more stuff from The Missing Manual series to entertain myself with more (hopefully) good books"
3,I don't like this at all,"I don't know why I bought this book. I guess I didn't realize that it's more of a how to on starting a website from the ground up. It's full of HTML codes and jibberish...listen, to me, it made starting a website sooooo difficult. I guess I expected it to be a guide to joomla and programs similar to that. But hey, it's my fault. I made a quick buy without really considering the content. I learned a bit of this stuff in high school, but with things like wordpress, joomla, and go daddy (etc.) starting a website is really as easy and pointing and clicking. However, I am going to keep it, in case one day I want to try it. I will say this book has very good step by step instructions and even illustrations, that even a person like me could build a site from the bottom up. So if that's what your looking for, it's a good buy."
3,Creating a Web Site: The Missing Manual,A very good manual where things are explained as coming from one that really knows addressing almost every reader level of understanding
3,OK,"This is a good reference book. However, if you know nothing about creating web sites it may be of little use. Also, if you wish to start a blog or a blogging business, this book is NOT for you! It only talks about [...], which is so easy to use it hardly deserves a chapter."
5,A most outstanding book,"I have been a system admin for 10 years. I have always did my best to avoid almost anything HTML. I was spoiled by being able program in Visual Basic (database apps) and had given up that I could EVER be able to make a functional web site much less a good looking one.It all came down to finally understanding CSS and how I can place my text and photos where I WANTED THEM to be (Tables were just not working for me). Even down to the exact pixel!!!!!With my knowledge of Ruby and Perl, I now feel I can start to do Web Applications and finally kick my Visual Basic crutch to the curb."
3,Interesting,"I am still completing this book. Not exactly what I expected, but interesting. The author talks alot about covenant relationships, using biblical stories. Would like to see some word studies before finishing."
2,Very narrow coverage for M users,"I bought an M8 a few months ago and wanted to learn more about the older Leica lenses. If you are an M user forget this book. It only covers lenses current at the year the book was written, anything before that is not mentioned. A grand total of 12 M lenses are described in a book 192 pages long. Most of the book is about the R system as it apparently had more lenses. Much better info is available free on line."
2,leica lenses,I expected a much more updated review of Leica lenses including the recent Summarit and Summilux lenses. I do not recommend this book for Leica fans.
1,Big mistake!,I purchased 2 DVD's one for my friend one for my self. My friend and I were both disappointed with it! There was no details on it and the only thing this DVD has a large women that can barely breathe talk about nothing!! VERY DISAPPOINTED!!!!!!!!!!!!!
3,Destiny Speaks,"Eric is a Red Bear who loves numbers, so where else would h have a job except in the BANK? He foils a bank robbery using the twos times tables, finds a new girlfriend who loves numbers as much as he does, and scoots off on his Vespa to a destiny fulfilled. Not for preschoolers, I'd use this one with second graders and older kids and challenge them to write their OWN arithmetical adventures for Eric the Red to continue his numbered days."
4,Victorian Women's Fashion Cuts,"This book was a wonderful addition to my library. It showed details of Victorian clothing which helped me to design and sew several Victorian replicas to wear. The book not only includes Dresses and Hairstyles, but Shoes, Hats and Coats. Clear details and a nice variety of images."
5,Very Good!,I really enjoyed this book. It has tales that spark the imagination from days of old. The only problem with the book is the text is a little messy in some spots and the pictures are not very clear. But over all its a great book!
5,Great reading for all ages,"The author makes it a point right off the bat that none of these stories are malicious in nature, so the book is perfect for kid bed time reading. The stories are varied, much like Grimm's Fairy Tales, so you can get a different ""lesson"" from each story. These stories are very different from the ones we know. There's no Snow White, no Sleeping Beauty, but there's a wonderful sense of something like those stories contained in the magic of these ones.Word of warning, though: they are written in a very unique style. Think along the lines of Memoirs of a Geisha, Joy Luck Club, or Mulan (all movie versions). The story might drag on, might sound weird at points, or you might have to explain a bit. If you are going to read it to children, be sure to read it yourself first, so you're prepared!!"
5,FLASH,This thing is probably not made anymore? It's a good cheap flash that works on my old Nikons.Easy to mount. Has a 2.5mm jack for your sync cord. Uses two AA cells. The plastic ears that go into the mount on your camera will break if you are rough with it.I get good flash pix with it. I use a home made diffuser to reduce shadows.
5,"A must reference book for every ""wordnerd"" out there.","For years, Paul Dickson has been fascinated by words. But unlike most people, he's done something about it: He collects them. He gathers words the way a butterfly collector snares his prey: He captures the unusual, the archaic, the eosteric and even the madeup. And every once in a while he blesses us all with the fruit of his labor, a volume of words that is more than educational, it's pure entertainment, too. Such is the new ""Family Words,"" Dickson's gift to the great American backbone, the family. Here you will find words that only a mother (also a brother, a sister and a father) would love and recognize. ""Family Words"" is as enjoyable as eavesdropping on your next-door neighbor, and as informative as well. And it's not just for wordnerds either!"
3,JLA does myth and magic,"Riddle of the Beast is an Elseworlds' tale that drops your favourite DC characters into the world of fantasy storytelling. A young lad (Tim Drake) and girl (Zatanna) must gather all the kingdoms together to fend off an attack from the beast (Etrigan the Demon). Despite some amazing artwork, the story still follows the conventions of your typical fantasy adventure. Once you take away the novelty of seeing DC superheroes in their new roles, there's really nothing new here (however, the chapter with weakened King Kal'El was pretty good). It's worth a look, but not worth the money for a hardcover purchase."
4,Feel the pleasure and pain,"This book is amazing, it completely puts you in the space of the protagonist, Iris Steele. You feel what she touches and what touches her. As a native of western Oregon I thoroughly enjoyed getting to experience the eastern part of our state. A painful story, but one filled with hope, too."
4,Episode List,This video is from the Primary years. It includes:1. An evening with Hamlet with guest star John Carradine2. Halloween with an appearance by Jerry Mathers
3,"Great talent, weak remix.","A great collection of the artist but a poor transfer to CD or a poor remastering. Sometimes the horns, drums and percusion overpower a truly remarkable voice. I have still played it over and over again on my 15 year old stereo. It does not seem to lend itself to surround sound."
4,Quality not quantity,"The remastering is EXCELLENT(up there with Rhino or DCC quality). Anyone who believes otherwise is possibly not used to the high end sounds missing from CD's mastered from second or third generation tapes. It can be a bit of a shock hearing the triangles, cymbals and acoustic guitars etc which weren't previously apparent. There are a couple of good Trent/Hatch tracks missing, in particular ""You're the One"", possibly because the compilers limited themselves to the US hits only. That's a pity."
5,"Nicely constructed controller, and not too expensive.","I use this controller for Windows XP which locates and installs the driver right away. There doesn't seem to be much need for calibrating it that I've noticed, but to get the most out of this controller I recommend a free program called ""Xpadder"" which will allow you to assign keyboard functions to the D-pad and the eight buttons. Xpadder can be downloaded from the Major Geeks web site at majorgeeks.com. If you use the Firefox web browser, you can find a plug in for that web site for your search bar using Mycroft Project. You'll be able to play games which normally use the keyboard much better."
3,A low budget controller,"I play some racing game very occasionally. My old gamepad needs a game port but my new computer does not have it. So I figured that maybe I need a basic gamepad.For the price, the gamepad is a good buy. Overal build quality is good with typical plastical feel. The connection to computer under windows vista is smooth and calibration is accurate.The biggest complain is that the direction control is not comfortable to hold. It sticks out from the pad too much and difficult to control when playing racing game. If you have a big thumb, you may give it a shot. Otherwise, you get what you paid: a basic gamepad."
1,Waste of time and money,"This product did absolutely no good for us. It made it difficult if not impossible to tighten the lap belt sufficiently and the result was the lap belt got pulled up, instead of the shoulder belt being pulled down. That can be fatal!"
4,good idea,"We have used these for all of our kids. They are not perfect but do work as advertised. My kids are smart enough to buckle and install the adjuster as needed.As a chiropractor, I can see they do move the belt to the proper spot. They do protect the neck area.Not perfect but better than nothing."
4,excellent,"You gotta love Slade: 1970's hard rock that sounds like Kiss with slightly better musicianship and without the greasepaint. Rock that Quiet Riot tried to make harder in the 1980s, only to dampen it with slick production.""You won't hear this on playlist b-llbusted classic rock radio, you won't find this in a teenager's collection with the Zeppilin and Purple albums, unless you know one incredibly astute kid.But for screetching, ballsy rock that sounds so fresh because it is so underplayed, you can't beet Slade."
3,"Good, but there are other Slade albums to get first.","This is the Slade album you get after you've bought the classics. 'Slayed', 'Play it Loud', 'Alive', and 'Slade in Flame' should all be checked out first. That being said, this is a decent album with a few outstanding tracks and a few boring ones. The band tones down the stomping rock of past (and future) albums, and focuses on the pop side of their sound. They pull off some great melodic hooks, especially on 'My Town' and 'When the Lights are Out', but more often the songs aren't quite up to snuff to pull it off, and you end up wanting more noize. Again, there's a lot to like here, especially if you're a fan. It only rates lower by the high standard set by their other albums."
4,So TRUE!,This is exactly how my friends would act on a trip. I scared me almost to watch these guys cause I just saw people I knew in everyone! It's pretty freakin funny at times and wow that Jason is a hottie hottie hottie!
1,No Good,This self retracting phone cord is just as bad as the regular phone cord I had. Within a few days the cord became so twisted that I opted to just use the speaker phone option instead of picking up the phone. The retractable device puts too much weight on the receiver. I am going to return this product.
2,"Interesting book, misleading title","As the subtitle indicates these are NOT ""All Saints"". So if you are looking for a book of biographical sketches of saints look elsewhere. If you consider Ghandi, Dr King and Dostoyevsky ""saints"" this book is for you."
4,Saint Carlos....November 4th,"I beautiful book..! I could not find Saint Carlos, though, traditionally on November the 4th."
1,This book disappoints,"On the rave reviews above, I made the mistake of buying this book thinking it could inspire me too. Despite all the talk, this book is NOT inclusive. There is no profile of anyone traditional in their faith, no Max Kolbe (who gave his life to save that of a Jew in Auschwitz), no Bernadette of Lourdes, no Blessed Kateri. But we do get Galileo, who in his spiritual life was sincere but not inspiring. He's included because he's a victim of the evil represented by the traditional Church. The author goes out of his way to stress his perceived narrowmindedness of the church. His bits on Biblical figures are very weak. I am surprised to find Stalin was not in this book. On the whole the thing reads like the manifesto of someone with a particular agenda and is tiresome beyond its trivial biographical detail."
3,All Saints,"There are some errors in this book. For example, the Feast Day of Saint Veronica is given on July 12. The Orthodox Church commemorates Saint Veronica on this day, but the Acta Sanctorum listed her feast on February 4. At least, the Author should use the one given from the Acta. Another problem is the case of Syro-phoenician woman. Her feast day is cited on October 13. Unfortunately, I could not find this entry on any primary sources."
3,Not orthodox but interesting nonetheless,"I quite enjoyed this book, particularly when the writer wrote about those we don't know - rather unknown heros who were edifyingly Christian. The political correctness got a little tiresome, but it still is worth having. I keep it on the table in the family room and my kids thumb through it now and then, pick a 'subject' and read. I'd rather they read about these folk, orthodox or not, than some celebrity magazine."
3,A Rich compendium of Spiritual Giants,"This valuable book provides short biographies of 365 men and women who should be models for our lives. They belong to diffenernt faiths, continents and centuries. The word 'saint' for some may refer to the martyrs and mystics of the traditional religions. But for Robert Ellsberg it refers to those men and women of moral strength and spiritual vision irrespective of their faith. However, he is not prejudiced against the traditional saints of the Church. It is fascinating to see the iconographic depiction of Mahatma Gandhi with Julian of Norwich.The bigraphies and quotes intented for each day of the year provide healthy spiritual inspiration and reflection and the whole book helps to correct our idea of sainthood."
4,Combines the best of the traditional with the new,"When you hear lives of the saints you think of the gruesome martyrdom and hard to believe virtues of the stories of the little red book from your youth. Ellsberg does a good job portraying in believeable terms the lives of the traditional saints, with those of not official saints of today. The relevance of their situations and heroism can set an example for those living in the modern world. Since no biograghy is more than 2 pages, its a great 1 minute exercise at the start of your day when an inspiring thought can help"
3,It's okay.,My book arrived on time and in the condition it was described as. There are cute pics in the book and I love the photographer's (Lisa Jane) work. The best part was finding out she does pics in Houston. Books okay. Anyone who likes the Ann Gedes type really dressed up photos should like this book.
5,Happy,I was so happy to find this book. Full of great ideas and wonderful photographs. It has given me a multitude of ideas.
5,"Poignant, searing, and right on target !!","Feminist icon Phyllis Chesler does it again!! The newly released updated version of her clasic monograph, ""Mothers On Trial"" is a powerful testament to the flagrant and continuing injustices that custodially challenged mothers face in this country and beyond. This compelling tome is a real page turner; guaranteed to evoke palpable emotions as egregious facts about the patriarchal family court system are revealed in nuanced detail. Beautifully written; empathic and courageous; tremendously insightful. For all mothers caught in the maelstrom of a child custody battle, it is strongly recommended that you run out and buy this book !! It will serve as a soothing and compassionate source of succor, while simultaneously educating, enlightening and empowering women who are faced with this excruciatingly painful tribulation. A must read !!"
