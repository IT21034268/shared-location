2,hmmmm,"definitely not the best rendition of the popular suite.on the other hand,try finding another one.stuff is edited,bludgeoned,rather.tempos verge on comical.rather disapointing,I really needed a nice version of the sugar plum faerie dance.will probably stick to Wendy Carlos's,cheesy,runningly cheesy,blue cheese smelly,even,as it might be,still holds the original pace and campy pomp....not nuch of a cheese shop is it?-it's fairly clean.certainly not contaminated by Cleese!"
2,Troubling movie,I was a bit troubled by the dark psychological abuse in this movie. Hard not to think about people actually living out there in an already troubled world doing this to another human being.I watched it once. I won't entertain viewing it again. Left me feeling weird.
3,BUY THE 1944 INGRID BERGMAN VERSION INSTEAD BECAUSE ...,"... it includes this exact same movie on the flip side as one of the special features, and the quality is comparable. I bought both since I didn't realize this. No need. The other one with both is like $1.00 more or something. Totally worth it."
2,difficult film to find; more difficult to watch,"I""ve always wanted to see this one. Anton Walbrook was so great in the red shoes. This film had been suppressed by MGM since they had made their own version. My sympathy was on the side of the suppressed version. Now that I've seen it, I can only say it disappoints in all areas. Stay with the Boyer version!"
3,1944 is much better,"felt that the '44 Cukor remake was much better than the 1940 British version. The later version fleshed out the background of the story, making the 'chance' meet-up of the murderer with the niece credible, rather than dropping the couple into the middle of the action--at the beginning of the movie. The one advantage of the earlier version is the more-credible insertion of the victim's cousin as a safety net for her rather than the improbably American-accented Joseph Cotten playing a Scotland Yard detective, although such an individual would have been more likely to crack the case than a former policeman. And in the later version, it is wonderful to watch the victim come to life as Cotten presents her aunt's glove to her and persuades her that, no, she didn't lose her mind. Her fury in the last scene is much more credible than in the earlier version when we are asked to wonder, ""Did she really lose her mind?!""--No, she didn't."
1,"Great Movie, Bad Transfer to DVD by 'Synergy'","This is a GREAT movie, but the 'Synergy' transfer to DVD looks like it was taken from an old 'Public Domain' VHS copy. It's muddy and dark; it's difficult to watch if you've seen a better transfer. Buy the 'Warner Home Video' DVD version instead.GaslightIt has mint condition versions of BOTH the 1940 AND 1944 version. Seeing both versions of this great tale (back to back) will make the 'Gaslight' movie experience even better for you."
2,Somewhat dissapointing,"This book was somewhat dissapointing to me. First, there are too many mistakes (yes there is a website that corrects some of them, but not even half of the mistakes). Second, after taking the first test from Transcender, I ran into at least five questions who's subjects were not even mentioned in the book, meaning I failed the test just on those points. While I wouldn't expect the book to go into detail on everything, I would expect that all relavent subjects be introduced. Since reading this book, I have noticed that the book on this subject written by ""Amit Kalani"" has gotten good reader marks.Good points: I liked the ""game"" test at the end. I also liked the labs. And to be fair, nothing in that this book covered was a waste. It just doesn't present everything necessary to prepare for the test which is what I would expect this book to do."
1,Bad study prep,"The demo for vs.net was very useful. Software aside, this book did not meet any of my expectations. I found a number of typos (especially in code examples). But, what really upset me was when I took the test that this book was sopposed to prepare me for only to find that there were a number of subjects that were not even covered in the book. (and I did learn the content of the book very well). Next, none of the questions in the book were anything like what the questions were like on the test. And finally, the practice test , although it was similar to the question format on the ms exam, did not provide any useful feedback! If you are looking to pass 70-315, look elsewhere."
3,Necessary but not sufficient,"I was amazed by the number of mistakes and typos in almost every chapter. I hope an ""Errata and Updates"" will be published to correct them. (I can provide a list on request).Anyway, I got the impression that this book was published in a rush and might have not been thoroughly revised and tested.As for the exam, knowing the content of this book inside out will help but not 100% sufficient to pass. (Sample questions are far away from reality).The .NET DVD that comes with it is very helpful if you don't have the full version. It might be worth buying the book just for the sake of the .NET Software.Marcellin N'G.England (UK)"
2,Don't by this book if you learn from practice exams.,"There is an included sample exam, but the application won't tell you which questions were wrong or give an explaination. The book is reference-like, while the exam is scenario-based. I agree that this book does a really poor job to help prepare for the exam."
3,Mediocre and incomplete,"My ""formula"" for passing the exams is to read a longer, more comprehensive book cover to cover first and then read the exam cram book as review and final prep.I found this book OK for step 1 of my formula but I do not feel it will be a very good non-exam prep resource for doing real-world work in the future. This book omits or is incomplete in several areas"
3,"Good show, but bad taste of humor","Type O Negative is strong enough to be seen live on this DVD, as a fan you can enjoy the riffs on Steele's bass, the rhythm guitars, the keyboards and drums. But is very difficult to not feel yourself annoyed with the stupid fat, bald and naked roadie who shows every two or three songs interrupting the magnificent spectacle. If you can avoid those ""funny"" sketches, do it! The extras aren't worth to be seen neither..."
5,Type O Positive =),"Great quality live concert, and scenes with the band having fun. Makes for a good laugh!"
1,What Happen?,"I LOVE Type O Negative, I have all of their albums and they are one of my favorite band to listen to. When I bought this DVD, I was excited to see them Live since I never seen them live. I was rather disappointed with the really awful sound quality and the front man vocal sounded like he needed to loosen up his vocal cords, but after a while, the sound got just a tad better but still, not fun to listen to at all. It was a boring concert with not many camera angles. There was many songs that I love that wasn't performed, but they did several songs I love, and others, I don't even know why they bother with some songs that isn't so great. I watched this DVD the first half of it and then later, watched the second half and that was it. I was finish with it. Being one of my favorite band, I was disappointed with this DVD. I tried watching it again to give it a chance. Oh my goodness, the sound quality was horrible and I couldn't stand it anymore. that's too bad."
2,Type O Negative,Another bad performance by Type O live. Every time I go see them I get more and more disapointed. They sound nothing like their cds. The sound is just the worse on this DVD!!!! Type O is one of my favorite bands and after watching this for 5 minutes I turned it off and it sits on my DVD rack collecting dust. Blaaaaaa
1,horrible,they do perform great my favorite band of all time but whoever done the audio on thismade a horrible dvd i`ve read tons of reviews on this and everyone says how great it is .....wrong its sdound is horrible i bought it just for type o but if u are planning to get good sound quality u wont
3,EHHHHH,"Don't get me wrong, I love anything Type O. This dvd isn't BAD..but it could have been better. The concert is boring. Same camera angles just repeated over and over. Type O is MUCH better live, so don't let this deter you from seeing them in concert! I could have thought of many others who would have done a better job at interviewing them as well, granted Juliya is nice to look at, but not exactly well versed in the glory that is the [...] from Brooklyn.The best parts are just seeing the band goofing off, and the bonus audio cd that accompanies the DVD. If you're going to go for a Type O DVD, I suggest After Dark. The footage is a bit grainy but at least you get more in depth and feel right at home with the band."
3,Great book! Doesn't work well as Kindle,"I have been a long time admirer of Mr. Reid's and his work and teaching style are impeccable. However, some of this is lost on the kindle version. While the text is extremely legible the images (what most of us are looking at) are poor. I find it a bit difficult to follow along step by step in this format. Also, for the cost of the digital version you can find a used book. Over priced for what it is."
5,A new classic?,"I dislike using classic on books that have been around less than at least 25 years! (Hey, test of time you know!) But! Morecraft is indeed a fine and thoughtful writer! In an age where people play Church ""fast and loose"" Morecraft gives a CALM, THOUGH-PROVOKING, CALL IN THE WILDERNESS regarding a thing which should seem simple. DOES the LORD wish our worship and approach to meet BIBLICAL mandates. I think it self evident and I challenge any who doubt this to read this work! It will move you. BE BLESSED IN JESUS CHRIST! SHALOM!"
3,48.4mm to be exact,0.6mm isn't much of a big deal for most folks..but it bugs me. Still works just doesn't fit a 50mm breville pod very well. The coffee particles on the side wall do not get flattened.Weighs about 160g. Not that heavy for a proper tampering. For the price it works.
3,Blue 49mm Espresso Tamper Stainless Steel Coffee,"Not a good fit for DeLonghi EC702 portafilter. It is not a bad product, just not the right size for the EC702 with 51mm portafilter.If you happen to have a 49mm portafilter then it would be a good product."
4,perfect espresso,"this is a great little tamper. Very stylish, and just enough weight to pack a perfect brew...so much better than the cheap plastic one that came with my espresso machine. It is really shiny metal, and slightly rounded on the edges, therefore it tamps the grounds smooth as you push and turn. Only complaint is that it is about 2mm too small in diameter for my sieve. Some of the grounds get pushed up and off the egde. I've learned to tamp over the sink and not get grounds on the counter. Otherwise, great product."
3,OK....,"Well, this isnt a professionally made video / biography about The Police, but done by a member of the band, the drummer, who took the footage and narrated it...As expected, the quality of the video doesnt view professional......"
2,ugh!,"Stewart Copeland was my favorite drummer growing up, emulating his style and practicing over and over his licks until I'd get them just right. Now as an adult, I was very nostalgically excited to see this film come about. But 10 minutes into the film I was ready to turn it off, only continued watching because of my youthful obsession. Boring and boorish. Steward Copeland doesn't come across well, his narration making me wince on multiple occasions. I'd skip this one, even if you are a die-hard fan."
4,That's what happens when a guy discovers what he can do...,".. with an editing software. It is a bit hard to watch (lots of video effects and unjudicious, startling cuts) but Stewart is good at filming events as they go.Being a die-hard Police fan, I enjoyed the exclusive footage a lot, as well as the on-tour ambiance of the time.Shall we say a must? yes, for the sake of nostalgia."
3,No DTS or Dolby 5.1 for Stewart's new mixes!,"Stewart did a great job of putting you in this amazing era. It's a must see film for any Police fan. Stewartdidn't shoot as much footage once Ghost in the Machine came out and beyond, so keep that in mind. But what hedid shoot and how he put it all together is a fun ride with the group. Stewart also created a soundtrack for hisfilm by re-editing Police studio and live multi-tracks to create something new. And it works! My only complaint isthat even though the box and disc itself state that the DVD is encoded with both DTS and Dobly Digital 5.1, theywere not encoded in the mastering and manufacturing of this title. I've notified Stewart's web site about thiswhen the title was released a few years ago, but never received a response. Note, the stereo mixes are on thereand sound great...but."
3,More Historical than Entertaining,"The old footage is nice to see, after not having seen anything new on The Police in several years. You really get a good feel for life on the road as the then little-known band treks across America's Heartland in the late 70s (note the t-shirt Sting wears during the recording of Zenyatta Mondatta: from Cain's Ballroom in Tulsa, Oklahoma!). Even though Stewart Copeland shot this footage, the DVD would be a lot more watchable without his corny, hammed up narration throughout. Bad, bad, bad. But the music is still good! If nothing else, this DVD will make you get out your Police CDs and revisit all those great songs for a couple days."
3,"well, I am curious","I honestly would enjoy watching this. I have always admired Stewart Copeland's musical ability (and not only his gift of percussion: HE taught picturesque lil' ""Sting"" exactly WHERE to play the bass lines on the Police' first hit, ""Roxanne""), and Andy Summer's a phenomenal ""less is more"" guitar style. But: I simply cannot, in all good conscience, purchase ANYTHING with that malignant, self-righteous hypocrit ""Sting"" in it. And since ""Sting"" is/was the ""frontman"" of the Police...well...I guess I'll wait till this comes out on ""late-nite TV"" to view it...."
3,"Get ""Around the World"" instead","I am a huge Police fan and have all of their stuff so I was excited to pop this one in the DVD player. However, I think 80% of it is leftover footage that didn't make it on the ""Around the World"" video released in 1983 which covered the the '80-'81 world tour.I still think you should spend the $10 and get it because of the awesome scene in Montserrat where Sting goes nuts on the bass jamming to ""Secret Journey"" that is very cool and I have played that part over and over.There are some decent live clips also, but in general not that impressive."
2,Anecdotally interesting for fans only,"With cash from The Police's first gigs, Copeland buys a camera and starts shooting everything, from the first tours of the U.S. in crappy sedans and shabby motels to the mega success of the band. Mildly interesting clips on the personnality of the three usual suspects, hints at the process that had them drifting apart, but never a thorough insight or commentary. The Police has been dead for 20 years, their latest tour is a sad testimony to it, and this DVD does not add much to the storyline."
4,Must See - Abrupt Ending,"Like the career of The Police, the end of this film seems abrupt. But it is a must see for all fans of The Police. It continues to leave me wanting more..."
4,Does Everyone Stare: A Review of Sorts,"I have been a fan of Stewart Copeland for 30 years. The Police were my first foray into the new wave/post punk era. I love this film because it's by my favorite band member.It's a wonderful chronicle of the beginning one of the the best bands of the 1980s. We see them start off like any other band; traveling in a beat-up van. Then they go to the US and find that they have to get their even more beat-up van to venues in a bigger country.I've read reviews of this film. Many critics have found it to be ""repetitive"" and ""redundant."" But isn't that touring, in a nutshell?If you are a fan of The Police and especially Stewart Copeland then I HIGHLY recommend this DVD."
5,quick review from police fan,"One of my favorite bands, saw them in a bar when they were raw, and have almost every recording and video available. There's some great footage on the video, and as mentioned in the other reviews, an inside account of the band during the years recorded. Essential item for die hard fans, other casual listeners may not appreciate. Easily worth ten bucks."
3,Good but not great look inside this iconic band,"This documentary, shot, produced and narrated by Stewart Copeland gives a reasonably intriguing look inside the early years, heyday and eventual breakup of The Police. The structure is episodic, with occasional frustrating large gaps, and it can be difficult to know exactly where you are in the career arc of these performers. Copeland's narration starts off slightly awkward but morphs into something better and more thoughtful, and drops some interesting clues as to the reasons for breakup. If you love the band as much as I do, then this is well worth it - just don't expect an exhaustive fly-on-the-wall approach to the material. That said, there are some excellent insights into just how weird, exciting and unexpected this sort of global fame could be. One warning - there might not be quite enough Sting if that's your only reason for buying this disc."
3,A good time to review the Police,"An interesting doc for 80s music fans. Well over twenty years after the Police called it quits, it seems a good time to look back. The documentary is not much - 71 minutes of familiar sights and sounds. It was refreshing to hear a very wise, aged Stewart Copeland narrate. It convinced me to hustle out and get ""Message in a Box"" the collected works of the Police. We might never hear music like that again."
2,The Police - Everyone Stares: The Police Inside Out,"Fantastic!!! As told by one of the finest drummers in the world. A first hand account of the hardships of starting out, their trials and tribulations, and becoming one of the most successful bands in history. A must see for any Police fan.AAAA++++"
1,What a bore,"Whats the big deal? What a waste of $10!Stewart Copeland is one of the best drummers ever, I gave him that on Synchronicity Concert DVD review.And most concert DVD's are lame. I am hard to please, to bad. I should be, if your going to charge me to watch your dvd.if its free on cable that is dif. ( oh wait, I pay $60 a month for it )can just turn the channel.lame dvd's, as most of them are, I paid for them so I might as well force my self to watch it all!Yes I read the back of this DVD before I paid for it and didn't see anything written about there is going to be much concert footage in here, but stupid me thought it would just have some? yes its just a hand camera, maybe I am miffed because there has to be some good shows on film and they have not released them yet, but this gets released. maybeAnd no surprise, that every time Sting is shown, he is his usual self! BROODING! when he is around people, he acts nice.If nothing else this shows what an insolent, crabby english twit he is"
3,A nice Flashback!,Having matured in the 80's you could not escape hearing the Police and they lead the New Wave across America!With the clips and Inside view this DVD providesyou see just How big the Wave was and also how they might tire of all the Fame! Wonderful to kinda see how they collaborated on all the hits until the end when they all went thier own way!
5,In a word...AWESOME!,"If you're a POLICE fan, this is a must have! I happened to catch it HBO one day and found myself loving the Police even more. I have always been a Police fan, but I was more into the Bon Jovi/Def Leppard bands of the day. This DVD gives you what everyone wants to see... The DIRT! Starting off with club dates, all the way to the top. An absolute rags to riches story about one of the greatest bands on earth..."
5,This book is a must for Bonsai,"One of the best books on Bonsai you can have in your library. Also consider Bonsai techniques 2,its a continuation of the firstbook."
2,Moves around too much,It does not fit as well as I expected in my cup holder in my truck. It tends to bounce out and cell phones do not stay put
4,Let's Count Baby,"My son really enjoys this book. He's at the age, 5 months, where the images are compelling and the language is not too heavy. And, of course, it is always an added plus that the main character looks like him!!!"
2,"wasteful bunch of colored pics. Basic chords, attempt more","This is a thick manual with little in it. The pictures are fine, but the layout is horrible. Stay away from this one. The Guitar Handbook is much better setup."
1,I don't know what ever ones sees,"Personaly i think this is a horrible book. Sure it has some nice introduction about guitars and amplifiers. Has more than enough illistration. However, i found this book VERY confusing. Especically when trying to understand theory from it. It had to stop after each paragraph and see what they were saying.. this was for the some of basics of theory which i know quite well. It even had me confused at time son what note are in a G major cord. I wouldn't recomend this book at all. It has alot of nice illistations and is a pretty to look at. Also contains a wealth of information, but i found the theory is this book to confusing to follow. I would defintly look for a differnet book.. especially if you are a begginner."
3,Cute program,"This is good for younger kids, say 7 and under, and it's a good way to get younger kids familiar with graphic type programs. There are a number of pictures that kids can color and print, along with very basic animation and sounds."
1,"Dishonest Vendor, Product Not TDK","I just received these blank dvd-r discs today. They are not TDK. In fact there is no label on them whatsoever. There's just a small tag that says ""Made In India.""It's kind of a bummer. I only bought these because they said TDK.Whoever these poor vendors are they're must be pretty hard up for cash to pull a fast one like that.Oh well... at least I've still had good experiences on Amazon too."
3,Half the tracks are marches or played like one,"This disc reminded me of Leonard Bernstein's conducting: somehow many of his conducting session became marches. Many tracks on this disc is like that. I am a novice when it comes to classical music, so part of allure of this disc was that it contained many titles I didn't recognize, so it wasn't a total loss. I guess I should have read the track listing more carefully... what is Washington Post by Sousa doing on dance compilation?"
1,can't hear,"I bought this phone because it has music on hold which is a feature I need. The problem is that the phone is so soft you can barely hear what others are saying. And they can't hear me either. In fact, you have to talk on speaker or you really struggle to hear at all. And my hearing is perfect. There are other annoying things like when the phone rings it sounds like a childrens lullaby and there's no way to change that. Same for the music on hold. I would put up with this gladly if I could hear when I talk to others but there's no point in a phone when everyone struggles to have a conversation."
5,Olympus 1GB XD memory card,Received in perfect condition. this product was delivered fast and it works really good with my Olympus camera love this camera had a 512MB before now i don't have to switch out and can take lots of pics with this memory card
5,Valentines Triple Feature DVD,Wonderful item. Received quickly and well packaged. Enjoyed the DVD and would order more if available.
2,beware if you watch this with your family,"I saw these movies on the WE channel some time ago and really enjoyed them so I was happy to see them on DVD. I realize that TV edits movies so I checked the ratings before I bought this and found it was NR. Hoping for the best, I made the purchase. I was glad I watched Treacherous Beauties without my kids because there was one scene that contained a lot of nudity that ruined the whole movie for me. In addition, this particular movie kept looping back to one scene and I had to go to scene selection to get out of it. The other two movies were fun and just as I remembered from TV with only a few extra scenes. I will be disguarding the movie Treacherous Beauties and hope it comes on TV again so I can record it."
1,Has anyone noticed?,"Does anyone else have a sneaking suspicion that all of the 5-star reviews for this book were penned by Mr. Glass himself? It's interesting to note that in almost all cases, this book recieved either 1-star or 5-stars (with the vast majority being 1-star reviews). If you dig into the reviewers who gave it 5-stars, 9 times out of 10 this is the only book they have ever reviewed. It's also curious that the first four reviews were all written on the same day -- May 12, 2003 -- and all gave the book 5-stars.It seems that Mr. Glass still hasn't kicked that nasty habit of fabricating stories, or in this case, reviews."
1,Terrible First Novel,"Set aside for a moment who Steve Glass is and consider the book solely as a novel - not as an act of contrition. What do you have? A poorly plotted and poorly written novel that has one real character - ""Glass"" - and dozens of poorly characterized other people who pass through the book in order to serve some purpose in relation to ""Glass."" So we have the suffocating parents who are supposed to show that Glass still can be loved. The ex-gf, who is supposed to show disloyalty. Cliff the reporter, who is supposed to demonstrate the vicious side of reporters. And assorted minor characters who are supposed to demonstrate the ""Glass,"" despite his wrongs, is still superior to everyone else.Glass can carry on an interesting story for 15 pages in Harper's, but he's unable to do it for more than 50, let alone the 350 that make up this disappointing first book. Let's hope there's not another.This book is a waste of [money]. Do not buy it."
1,No Class Glass,"As far as I'm concerned, Stephen Glass should never be given one ounce of praise or accomodation for spinning his tales and lies, all that were published to the public record.He is no journalist, let alone a writer or a human being."
3,The Fabulist,"As an aging hippie, aspiring writer, and professed manipulator, I found great value in the saga of Stephen Glass. Although he wreaked havoc on his colleagues, I applaud his efforts to rise from the ashes and find a use for his ability to invent, embellish, and carry to extreme the trail of events that tumble one to the next. Admission of self inspection, though perhaps narcissistic, is nonetheless edifying for anyone who has been drawn into the folly of their own lies.The characterisations are weak and rather simplistic, but as a first work of barely veiled fiction, I applaud the work and found it to be entertaining, extremely readable, with some thought provoking depth, and from the first page, hard to put down.I will look forward to further work of Stephen Glass in print."
4,TRUTHFULLY...a good book.,"Yes, Stephen Glass did some shameful things. That, however, does not change the fact that his writing style is very good. The book was certainly interesting; a good look into the mind of someone who seriously had a problem with lying. Everyone does it...this guy just got caught; but at least he's not condoning what he did. Many people write stories based on their lives and don't get blasted for doing so; why should Glass be any different? This book should be taken for what it is...a decent story written by someone who knows how to write."
5,This book is amazing!!! And I'm not Stephen Glass!!!,"I read this whole book in one sitting. I started it on a Sunday night and skipped work on Monday just to finish it. And I do have a job. I didn't get fired for writing lies.I'm not even Stephen Glass and I loved it. Trust me, I'm not him.The best part of the book was how I ... I mean Stephen Glass was really a good guy, even though he got fired from the New Republic for cooking stories.Stephen Glass is is a great man. I wish I were more like him.If you want to become more like him, you should bye his book. I bought multiple copies and had one put in a glass case (no pun intended cause I'm not Glass) for safe keeping, because I think this will become a timeless classic and eventually be worth alot of money.If you read this, beleive me. I'm not lying."
1,Just plain dreadful,"The main character, who cunningly has the same name as the author, never really develops as a character. There are no changes or lessons learned. All of the characters are largely cardboard and unsympathetic. If you really have a burning desire to read it, try the library.If you want to read Mr. Glass's better fiction, just pick up his articles from New Republic. They are much more entertaining."
3,Conflicted while reading,"After showing the movie ""Shattered Glass"" to my students for years in Journalism class, I decided that it was time to read the book written by Stephen Glass.I was conflicted throughout the book, but that conflict made the book a good read.As a reader, I found myself anticipating what was coming next, feeling sorry for the character, then, quickly remembered that as a journalism teacher, this guy was a liar. I wasn't supposed to feel sorry for him. Was anything in this book truthful. It is a novel. But it seemed so similar to what he did in real life, that I would find myself not feeling sorry for him. He deserved it. Then, thinking, well, that person was way over the top in his interaction with Stephen. And of course, back to ""He deserves it.""For a journalism teacher who has shown ""Shattered Glass"" and the 60 Minutes interview in class, read the book. It's not an intellectual masterpiece, but you owe it to yourself and your students to read the book."
1,Scam,"What? This is a novel a publisher bought and paid for and distributed and is a novel some people have taken seriously? Get out of town. The narrator is a sniviling weasel who is misjudged and whose feelings are hurt by girls as a boy. He is self-absorbed and, to all appearances ( like Jake's comment about Robert in The Sun Also Rises )a case of continuing adolescence. At least Robert could box. This guy Stephen Glass ought to be barred from publishing for ten years as are Wall Street felons. This novel is just another scam and its publishers ought to be ashamed of themselves. Don't read this book, you'll only get depressed."
1,Hallucination of Evil,"There is only one way this badly concocted, nauseous vat of ego-expanding psychotic blather got a rating above zero on any book review site. The author and/or his friends and family are doing all of the voting. You have a choice when considering whether to buy, borrow, or accidentally read this book. Should you spend a few hours getting yourself convinced that Stephen Glass is a dangerous psychotic serial liar, void of both talent and remorse, or should you go to the dentist and get a voluntary root canal? Option two is less painful than the first choice."
1,"The movie, the book & reality","I recently watched the movie Shattered Glass so I picked up the book to read. I tried to get through it but what prevented me from finishing were my thoughts about the people who he worked with during those years. I thought about how they must have felt when it was disclosed the articles were lies. I wondered how the hard working people at the magazine felt after they had to deal with the aftermath. A better book would have been to write it from their point of view and I think the author perhaps would understand the true damage of his actions.In the end, the only victims are those co-workers and the reputation of the magazine. I hope all who were there have been able to move forward and continue to have wonderful careers.I'm glad I caught the movie. I just couldn't get through this without questioning my own motives in even reading such a book after realizing how many good people got roped in this sad affair."
1,Don't waste your time but watch the DVD,"Don't waste your time with this trash but watch the ""Shattered Glass"" DVD if you're interested in this story. ""Shattered Glass"" did an excellent job of telling the Stephen Glass story. You will not feel the least bit sorry for Stephen, a pathological liar and master manipulator who couldn't seem to care less about the lives he effected. Let's not reward Stephen's lack of a conscience by buying this dribble. Besides, he had written enough fiction before his first novel."
2,5 stars?,Having read this book and observed Amazon custiomers' 5-star reviews one must wonder if Stephen Glass has visited this website.
1,Don't bother with this tripe,"...Trite characterizations, weak plotline, and lackluster writing make for a very, very poor read. If this editorial conman were a talented writer I'd give him a break but I finished this piece of [work] wondering why in God's name a reputable publisher would issue something as weakly written and conceived as this.It might have made a decent magazine article but then one is reminded that no reputable magazine would ever buy anything from this disgraced ex-journalist. Thinking of buying this book? Take a tip from those magazine editors---Just say NO."
1,shameful sequel,"This is by far THE worst movie of the 1990's, if not ever. Also known as BOOGEYMAN 3, it's literally 1 hour of recycled footage from the original BOOGEYMAN (minus the actors dialogue - which instead has new actors speaking over the scene and describing what's happening) and has only 17 minutes (! ) of new footage. In those few scenes, some bimbo is with her psychiatrist in a trance claiming to be psychically linking with Lacey from the original at the SAME TIME Part one is taking place (odd, then, the obvious new footage is taking place in the early 1990's, while the same time events are clearly early 1980's). Bland, stupid and even more insulting than the similar BOOGEYMAN 2, which at least had 30 minutes of new footage, this is one of the biggest ripoffs and has continued to destroy what could've been a very lucrative and inventive franchise."
3,Research material,"This book is a good sampling of various medieval and premedieval penance lists. The Celtic rites are well represented, other parts of the European world are not so well represented. Some prior familiarity with the subject matter is helpful to make sense of the time span and geography of when and who might have used these tables of penance. The authors make clear that the actually implementation of these sanctions is largely undocumented."
2,more of the same,"I like these stories, but really, they are mostly thin variations on the same theme so far. family from ""our"" timeline, or close enough, visits low-tech timeline, gets in trouble, silly love story on the side, LOTS of repetition. So much repetition it feels like something from an oral tradition, or written for people with memory loss. Way too little exploration of the new alternate worlds. It's a short story padded to novel length, really. I buy these when I'm looking for a book, it's late, and the Kindle one-click is right there ... it's a guilty pleasure like a giant bag of potato chips. If you still want to buy this book, welcome to the club. But it isn't a good book. :)"
5,very nice condition,These dvd's came quickly with only a few marks on them that do not seem to effect the ability or quality of playback. I had enjoyed the shows on TV and will now be able to watch them when I want with a great quality picture for my new TV.
4,Good show to watch with the family,"Stargate Atlantis is not exactly the highest quality show ever but it is totally entertaining and I appreciate that I can watch it with the kids. The second season is better than the first but it is easy to see that their operating budget got bigger and thus the graphics, writing, etc. There were only two episodes (in season 2) that were even questionable but only because a woman strips to her bra and another you see topless from the back. Otherwise, it's great, clean fun."
4,Great Value for the Price!,"My husband and I love this tv. It fits in our smaller bedroom so nicely on the wall. It also has a very crisp, clear picture. Remote is pretty basic, but it works. The sound could be a little better, but for the size and price, it's a great deal."
2,Average TV,"TV picture and sound are just average. Mine lasted less than a year before it broke, hence the 2 stars. I'd rather spend more and get a better TV next time."
4,impressive,"I just received my Danger, sidekick side pouch. My first reaction was very nice, but looks small? That's because it's just ment for the first sidekick not the sidekick II which is longer! Never the less I made it fit. I like it? Even though it's hard to get it in and out it's so comfortable because of the horizontal design! My only wish would be that they made one that is made for the sidekick II model. (Hint, hint!)"
3,NOT FOR THE SIDEKICK II,I know the poster below me said this already but I will put it in the subject line so it's easier to see before you jump the gun and buy one.
4,great for their earliest interest in space,"This book is very readable at the kindergarten/first grade level. It's great to find a book for that first introduction. My kids read and re-read it. There are facts about every planet, nice illustrations, and comprehensible text."
5,Very good introductory book for young minds,"Very good; concise book to introduce our preschooler to the solar system; and a nice reminder for parents as well. Illustrations are good, giving the a good sense of proportions and distance. The book starts with a few introductory pages and then a full page per planet; from closest to the sun to the farthest. It includes Pluto as a 'dwarf planet' in this updated edition."
5,this is what party music should sound like,Dj alligator project is an up & comming mastermind off club music im not trying to sell you this cd but once you hear it i kid you not you will get hooked. You probably already heard some of his work at local club's like the whistle song wich is a a great tune to dance to & off course lollipop wich is another one off his cool techno club mixes & more.If your the type that enjoy's dance tune's like darude well dj alligator is even better.
2,Trash bin material,"The author was so absorbed with himself and his need to take revenge of his ex-fiancee (who was lucky to get out of this unlucky union, from which only the author benefited), that it made it impossible for him to concentrate on the plot. The book is dull no end, author's humor is flat and I had huge difficulties finishing it. Threw it to a trash bin."
3,Passable read,"I got a little irritated with his self absorption (I can see why his girlfriend left him) - would have liked to know a little more about his brother since the book was entitled ""Honeymoon with my Brother"". Felt his brother's perspective as absent as was any meaningful dialogue between the two. It was passable, light bedtime reading, but wouldn't recommend."
5,Keep writing and traveling!!!!!! Fantastic read!!,"I am always looking for a good travel book, and this one was the BEST I have ever read! I own a home in Puntarenas, Costa Rica,so I identified so much with the situations these guys experienced! Traveling and living in another country is meeting the ""real"" people, talking with the locals, having dinner with them, sharing ideas and thoughts about this planet. And when all is said and done, one has to say that the best experiences are usually the ones that at the time seem to be total disasters! I can't wait for the next book!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Needed an editor,"While well intentioned, the writer really needed a good editor: the prose should have been pared down and spiffed up, the repetition should have been eliminated, and the book's front section could have been cut WAY back. The travel part doesn't start until one-third of the way through the book, and by then I was ready to toss the book against the wall. Much less about the writer, his brother, and their not-so-compelling personal problems and more about the people, culture, and sites of the place he visited would have made this a much better book."
5,Honeymoon with my Bro,"This book is a must read. I just finished reading a copy of Honeymoon with my brother and I'm basically in tears. I've never read a book so touching, hearfelt, and downright amazing. Two days ago I found myself bursting out in laughter on the subway in Manhattan, reading about the ""sugar penis"" story. I couldn't wait to get home and share it with my own brother and roommate. Wisners' words, images, stories, and observations are so refreshing and meaningful. I didn't want the book to end."
1,"Bad writing, shame.","I was really excited about this book Right up my alley. But the writing was so flat, borderline unintelligible, that I couldn't slog through the first 25 pages. Wish he'd had a ghost writer, because it sounded like it could have been an interesting story."
2,"Good Read for Rich, Entitled, and Self-Absorbed Travelers","I spent about two years reading all the travel narratives I could find, and there were a number of books which impressed me with the high quality of the writing and the sense of adventure contained therein. This was not one of them. The title ""Honeymoon with My Brother"" is absolutely fabulous, but it only goes downhill once you actually open the cover. The author has a clear sense of entitlement and absolutely gleams with his own self-importance. This is not an adventure. This is a poorly cobbled recount of the author's accomplishments under the guise of modesty. He claims to be throwing away a corporate lifestyle, yet it's clear he never, not even once, actually escapes from the shadow of his ""former"" corporate life. The present (i.e., the travels in the book) is continually overshadowed by his previous achievements in the workplace."
3,Disappointing,"I expected an interesting account of two brothers traveling the world, but found that as much as half of the book is the author's rehashing his relationship with his fiance (he goes all the way back to their meeting and courtship), their break up, and his demotion from his job. I simply was not interested in these events -- it would have been sufficient for me if he'd said briefly, ""My beloved fiance dumped me, my future was in question, my heart broken, then I was demoted at work. With nothing left to lose, I embarked on an adventure with my brother."" Then tell us about the adventure!By the time I got halfway through the book, I was skipping pages to avoid the annoying personal diary parts to get to the travel parts. I guess that's the risk of writing a ""hybrid"" book like this: part diary, part travel nonfiction."
2,Un-heartfelt book about what could've been interesting travel adventures,"The title captured my attention. So did the summary of the book. The book, however, was a disappointment. The author and his brother sounded like they had quite an adventure traveling the world, but was unable to capture it in the book. The book was emotionless and lacked any interesting details about the travels. In the beginning, the author had a chance to make the reader sympathetic about his woes with his fiancee dumping him at the last minute and his demotion from his well-paid job. Yet, I couldn't be convinced of this as it was written almost like an article - the details were there, but with no emotions attached to it. Furthermore, his adventures were written haphazardly, almost as if he was too lazy to read through his notes (if he took any) on his travels and was just writing by memory. I couldn't picture any of the places he traveled to."
2,Honeymoon With My Brother,"Shallow. Simple. No nuggets of wisdom here. No insight into the places or the people he meets. I kept hoping he could evolve from his young Republican sell-out, Christian want-to-be mentality. I gave up at 2/3 into the book. This would have made a better blog for his family and friends. Bill Bryson, this guy is NOT!"
4,A Great Trip,"This book caught my eye in the bookstore with the big armchairs, which was lucky because I couldn't put it down. I had to buy it to find out what happened to this guy who was left at the altar. I was intrigued by the demise of his seemingly perfect relationship and by the way that cataclysmic event brought on both a literal journey of self-discovery and a renewal of a withered sibling relationship. The brothers' unusual ports of call in Eastern Europe were a refreshing change from the typical travel diary. I was impressed by the author's willingness to take his life (and his brother) in a completely different direction and accept whatever came of it. It is good to see that people can reinvent themselves at any time of life, no matter how many of the trappings of career and relationship thet seem to have taken on. Well done Franz. Where to next?"
2,Mixed review for mixed up story,"In my opinion, the interesting parts of this story were the travels themselves and the relationship between the brothers. The dull parts were when Franz would indulge himself, his escapades and ""his"" Annie. Hopefully, the story worked as therapy for him as much as he feels the travel did. I am guessing that a story written from Kurt's perspective would be more exciting. I did finish the book, though felt it dragged on, and have to admit I'd see the movie...for more insight on Kurt."
2,Dismal writing,"Oh please. This political flack actually broke away from his happy Republican consumerism and took a trip. Luckily he eventually opened his eyes and heart to the people he met. Hiding within this poorly written book is a good book which never escaped.BTW, I'm amused at all the diatribes about using guidebooks, then he mentions you can get the same info from the concierge at your hotel. The $5 per night fleabags he says he stays in have concierges? I think not."
4,quick and simple,"I found the item that I needed and the ordering was quick and simple. My item arrived in seven days. Amazon is an easy way to find what you are looking for..Best way to shop....I highly recommend ""AMAZON"""
5,FABULOUS!,"I stumbled across this book watching a morning television show and decided I had to go out and buy it. I'm so glad I did. This is one of the best books I have ever read. It was funny, enlightening and uplifting. I've always wanted to travel around the world, this book only made me want to do it more and without all of those cushy travel packages with air conditioned tour buses and four star hotels. I can't wait to hike up to Machu Picchu and roam the ruins at Ankor Wat. I loved this book so much I searched for more pages when the book ended, that I was sad when LaRue passed away and I laughed at the worst taxi driver ever. I can't wait until they write another one!"
5,Franz Rocks!,"I worked with this guy when he was on Capitol Hill working in a Senator's office, and he left to go back to California to work with the Governor after an election, and always wondered where he went off to...now I know! He was such a great guy back then, that I couldn't believe he'd been dumped by this woman, but it's just like Franz to do the proverbial ""make lemonade out of lemons""! Rest assured this book isn't about/by some fake, Franz is a genuinely good guy and the sentiment about re-exploring one's life is something he's sincere about...he didn't do this just to write a book, but to make a difference -- and I'm sure he will!"
2,Yuck,"I was misled by the book jacket into believing this was a funny story about a couple of home boys who go off around the world together to forget their woman troubles. Which, quite frankly, could have been a fantastically entertaining book.Instead, this was a lugubrious portrait of an unapologetic political lobbyist and his sad breakup with Annie. The whole idea of feeling sorry for a political lobbyist, in this decade of dashed dreams and political malfeasance, is hard to swallow. How much do we really want to read about his $500 dinners with state legislators to win business for his employer?In William Least Heat-Moon's beautiful book ""Blue Highways,"" it takes him about two perfectly-honed paragraphs to explain how his marriage and career had come to an end, and why his reaction was, in essence, to flee. In this book, the same information consumes nearly two hundred pages.I see this book as a wasted opportunity to tell a good tale."
4,Great Book Club Read,"My book club just finished ""Honeymoon With My Brother"" and we just loved it. It was adventurous, funny and sad. If you are in a bookclub just e-mail him he is just wonderful. Two weeks ago we had bookclub and I called him and he presented over the phone to our club his book. Last night we had bookclub and I called him and we were on speaker phone for at least 45 minutes to a hour. I just can't say enough about the book and Franz."
3,"Light and easy, but not very deep","This book is a very easy and quick read, but ultimately not very fulfilling. The author skims over some key moments in the book, and fills much of the rest with clichés.The brother, Kurt, isn't very well developed, which is a shame because he seems like an interesting character. The relationship between Franz and Kurt is talked about quite a bit, particularly in the beginning. Ultimately we learn their relationship has improved, Franz has learned more about his brother in 2 years than he has in the past 20, and they've become best friends. The problem is, we're not shown this development. Nothing in the book really suggests the relationship is any different, and we have to take it on faith because we're told it's better. I have no doubt the brothers bonded and learned much about each other during their travels, but we're not able to see the growth in the passages."
4,Cute book,"I enjoyed it - would advise the author not to dwell on the being left at the alter thing so much - the idea of traveling with a family member is nice, and could be something that many people should consider."
2,Doesn't live up to the hype,"This book has several things to recommend it: the premise is great, traveling can be an amazing adventure, and the author has an occasional insight which is either moving or accurate. On the other hand, the author writes with the moral depth and talent of a smartish highschooler, not like an educated or particularly creative or imaginative grown-up. He acted so ungentlemanly that I was embarrassed for him. There's a lot of discomfort reading such a confessional book when the author doesn't seem to hear how unkind and selfish he sounds. There are so many hilarious travel books out there-- take a pass on this one."
1,Don't bother,Trite and flat writing. Predictable. I tried reading this mess and ended up using it as a coaster. There are sooooo many good books out there - why read a bad one?
4,Learning How To Travel Light,"I'd heard about this book and couldn't wait to read it. At first I was a little disappointed because it wasn't the way I thought it would be. The author was affluent and political and wasn't the poor hapless fellow I thought he should be. Well, those were my prejudices and I had to quickly drop them so I could appreciate the story as it was. I love the Odyssey of this book, as Franz and his brother wander through the world gradually letting go of more and more baggage until what they have left is themselves. Truly an enriching experience. It was delightful, insightful, visceral, and a good way to meet the world without having to leave the comfort of my living room."
3,Fun but lacking depth,"This book has a lot of potential - the premise is interesting and boded well for stories of adventure and personal growth. The final product is more of a light summer read than a philosophical game-changer. Fun, but not particularly satisfying."
4,Great Read,This autobiography of two brothers who decided to travel around the world is well done. Buy it or borrow it. Read it.
5,My journey with the brothers...,"Good ol' Davis, California word of mouth led me to this book. I devoured it on a Sunday afternoon...it goes by quick and you DON'T want it to end. Franz has a way with giving fantastic details without being too wordy (you don't skip paragraphs to get to the good part) and before you know it you are on the honeymoon from the comforts of your own living room. There are quite a few laugh out loud moments, none of which I will spoil for you. You can relate on so many levels, for me it was the heartbreak (and the flashbacks of it)...you are truly inspired by their leap of faith into the honeymoon. I had the chance to meet the brothers in Seattle for the book signing and they are funny, charming (not to mention easy on the eyes), and deserve every bit of where this is leading them. I can't say enough good things about them or the book...the only downfall to this book is the travel bug you are left with..."
3,This does in fact work...,"...but I still question the price. There are other items out there that will work just as well (or better, like a panty girdle from RAGO) for the same price or cheaper.I guess the price is the only thing I have against this item. It could be the holy grail of femininity for you, who knows?XOXO"
4,"Works well, but perhaps not for heavier crossers.","Fit about as well as I expected. I really don't have the proper body type for this sort of thing.If you're a bit heavier, I'd go for a fuller panty-style gaff. The sides like to roll up and make it rather uncomfortable."
3,the gaff that hides some,"the ultimate hiding gaff is functional and easy to wear but pinches a little as you walk around, and has a tendency to ride up a little when you sit down. plus the it never sits flat when worn under other garments."
2,Real girl's panties do a better job,"This hiding gaff make you look really like an old lady, while girl panties will do a better job. And surprisingly, it's hide much better than this."
2,what!,This was not what expected.This product is nothing more than a simple pair of panties for men.It does not hide my bulge nor does it make me appear more femine.This was a waste of my hard earned money and time.they should make a product that has a built in cup to hold the testicles and a pouch to hide the penis
3,More then just CDing,"Can also be used to hold up a Hydrocelle. Every single peice of under garment I have tried is just stretched down under the weight then is no longer doing it's job of holding anything up. But even this item has a flaw that the Hydrocelle found, not enough matriel to fully cover all the stretched out skin caused by the Hydrocelle."
1,shorts,"I'm not a Crossdressing, Transgender or Transvestite Man but I used these underpants at a Norwegian body building contest I was in. The airlines lost my luggage so I didn't have my shorts to compete in. My friend, who was drunk at the time, picked these up on sale at a used clothing store.They are too tight, and stick up your [blank] so they are very uncomfortable to wear on the beach or under pants.You might want to avoid putting this on your head too since it will squeeze all your hairs up."
1,Do NOT use (if you value your devices),"I guess there is a certain leap of faith when you plug a $300 device into a wall with a $0.01 plug...I have used 3 of these, 2 have blown up.The device I plugged in, and the current in the buildings were all within the specifications of the the plug. Granted, I was traveling in China, and they use 240V, but the plug claims to be able to handle this.In short -- buyer beware."
1,No Thanks,"I received this item and the outer housing was cracked and broken. Completely unnacceptable. Not worth returning, but extremely unsatisfied."
5,Great Prouct,Can't beat the price of this product order 3 so I always have a place to charge my Evo. Fast shipping great product.
3,Great little adapter,"I would give it 5 stars because it has worked great for months since I have been using it. I connect the USB data cable for my blackberry to charge at work. This way I don't need to carry the charger that comes with the phone and the data cable for times when I need to charge it in the car. I always carry the same cable and switch the adapter.The only issue I have is with the quality of the adapter. It feels light and cheap. But that's why the price is so good I guess.Otherwise, no complaints!Update:After months of use, the connections (to usb) became loose and the product is no longer reliable. i have oem adaptors similar to this and they have no issues. i dont know if it's the build quality (it is pretty cheaply priced) thats not good or it's just mine.seller is awesome but not sure about the product quality (after some use)"
2,Great...Untill it died,"I bought this for charging all my USB devices on the go (phone, iPod, etc). It worked great for about 4 months. Then one day, the light on the back wouldn't come on, and it wouldn't charge anything. I gave it a good whacking, plugged it in, and the light came back in. I was pleased, until i heard a loud *pop*, and a unpleasant smell entered my nose. The charger was slightly melted. The light was still on, but i didn't dare plug any of my devices into it. DO NOT BUY! Spend that extra $10 or so and get a name brand charger that works and has a warranty."
3,USB Adapter,"Eh, it's ok, I guess. Won't work on iPod Touch, works on Walkman, not on Motorola Rengade cellphone. Kind of a crapshoot on compatability. Pay your money, take your chance."
3,Not another AC to USB adapter,Unlike my other AC to USB adapters it will not charge a Razr V3.I did not test it with any of their indicated devices.
1,Does not work on 5.5 gen iPod,Buyers beware: this charger does not work on the latest ipod video generation 5.5 .
2,Just another ac to usb adapter,The long list of compatibility is there to fool you. It is only a AC to USB adapter.
1,Disappointing!,"Such a disappointing flavor! Bitter, bitter, bitter. I am familiar with a variety of brands of wasabi peanuts and like all of them--except this one. And now I'm stuck with 9 pounds of bitter-tasting nuts. What a mistake.I have liked all the Diamond nut products I have tried in the past and am very surprised to find that this one must have been taste-tested by people with taste buds very different from my own. Even my husband--who is wonderfully easy to please--doesn't like these."
1,Absolutely terrible,"I love good wasabi peanuts. This ain't them.The biggest problem with Emerald's take is that the medium used for the wasabi coverage is soy sauce and not a very decent one. The overall flavor is extremely unpleasant: sour, bitter - but NOT the wasabi flavor they SHOULD have. The nuts don't have much characteristic wasabi 'tang' to them - they're very pallid in that regard. But far more important: that bitter soy sauce flavor overrides everything; instead of the purity of peanut and wasabi, there's a muddled yet very unpleasant tang of flavors which do not mesh well at all. Do yourself a favor and pass on Emerald. I wish I had...the (remaining) unopened bags sit in their shipping box."
1,Gross. Doesn't taste like wasabi,These don't taste like wasabi. They're actually gross. I'll stick with the wasabi peas from the grocery store. I'm going to throw these away.
3,Desmond Not Comfortable Among Brazilian Masters,"OK, OK - Take a bunch of Brazilian stars and get them into the studio with a Jazz master. There is a big chance to work out well but here the chemistry simply did not hip. This is a post-Bossa Nova event with post-Bossa Nova composers Milton Nascimento and Edu Lobo. All very good but this CD ..."
5,"A stunning, astonishing play, full of unusual insight","This is from Tony Saroop's excellent review of the play:Mishima's ""sensibility is closer to and retains elements of an archaic, pagan, 'pre-Christian' sensibility, a sensibility we have completely lost touch with, but which Sade seems to have tapped into and evoked out of his inner self. . . .""I think this is why Western scientific scholarship, with its naive belief in the efficacy of rational discourse, a form of discourse which does little more than generate disagreement, has not and never could give us a full and satisfactory explanation of the Sadeian mystery, which is also the deep, repressed mystery of ourselves. There is something in Sade which rises above the rational, something that only poetry can comprehend, and which Mishima has attempted to evoke [with] great poetic beauty."""
4,Well Written and a Good Read,"I liked 'Resurrecting Mingus' because I am glad that the characters were true to themselves. Elaine, Carl, Eva and even Glenda were true. This story had a lot of real life to it and it didn't seem totally fictionalized. There were some plots to the story that would have made it a tad bit more interesting, like if Mingus and Steve had actually had a realtionship. This considering that Mingus' parents were going through similar interracial problems. Mingus appeared to have a lot of problems with relationships, especially her family and I was happy to see that she was dealing with them by the end of the story. I would have like to have seen how the situation turned out with Eva and Mingus or even Mingus and her mother, but it probably better left to the imagination. Good read."
4,Very good to the last drop,This book was a very good read. It is a must buy.The author gave you a story about an woman and herfamily. The woman Mingus had alot of issues to dealwith her pops leaving her moms her bad relationshipsand a crazy sister you just have to read to see what shedoes to settle all of these issues
4,Page Turner,"My boyfriend had read this book and sent it to me to have a look at. I enjoyed it immensely, could not put it down from Page 1. Since this is a first I can't wait until her next.I agree with someone had written earlier, this book had me emotionally engaged with all parties from feeling the pains of divorce, sibling rivalry, the doubt of that rebound love to the frustrations of being in a interracial family. I reccomend this highly to anyone who enjoys good books that don't neccesarily end up tidy to placate the general ""reading-happily-ever-after"" public.Brava' Ms. Adams... and I am looking forward to your next book."
5,Finally a story that isn't like all the others,"This was my first book written by Ms. Adams, and I have to say that I like her writing style. The book caught my eye from the first page up until the last. When Mingus cried, I wanted to cry.The whole situation with her mother trapping her father into marrying her was messed up. The situation where she had a little sister because her father cheated was even more messed up. Her relationship with her sister also was a problem, but the situation that takes the cake is when her sister and her boyfriend have an affair. I know they didn't have sex, but still. He cheated, even thought not intentionally, and her sister, her flesh and blood, did that to hurt her.I felt Mingus was really strong in the end. It seems that she finally had her head on right and was going to start looking after herself. And that's always good to read about. All in all, the book was an excellent read."
4,Loved this book!,I came across this book in the library. I checked it out on a whim. I finished it in 4 hours. It's a page turner. It's worth reading.
4,Resurrect your mind and read this book,"When I first started the book, it took me some time to get into it. The writing style is different, but once I got into the character Mingus, it was hard to put down the book. The story is about Mingus. She has a great career, but her personal life is not all that good. Her relationships never seem to last, she does not get along with her sister, and she is grappling with changes in her family. She is bi-racial, but always identified herself as black. When she gets involved with a white man she has to question if she is doing the right thing, then she meets Eric who is a black man and that complicates things even further. When she thinks she has finally found the love of her life, a bombshell is dropped that rocks her to the core. When she cries, you will want to cry. You want her to find that happiness that we often times think is elusive. I'm looking forward to reading Jenoyne's next book."
3,Interesting Read Surreal and Eye Opening,"This was an interesting book and story to read. Resurrecting Mingus is an eye opener book and is so surreal in many ways. This book deals with interracial dating and marriage. It also deals with hatred, lack of communication, sibling rivarly and ultimately dishonesty and mistrust. Mingus Browning and her family have more drama than a little bit. She has to deal with a jealous sister name Eva. Her parents Carl(Black) and her mother Ellie(Irish)start the ball rounding with their separation and none of their lives will ever be the same. Then there's Glenda and Eric who add a bit of their own drama to the gumbo pot. What this book reveals and teaches you along the way, is unforgettable in more ways than one. It also allows you to see how secrets and lies can and will destroy all that you have and have worked so hard for.If you want drama, then this book will surely give it to you."
1,Bad deal for an EBOOK,"As an Ebook I would not recommend this to anyone. The hardcover has color pictures, but the ebook has only drap black and white photos. Also in order to access the full chapters initially I had to go backwards from the chapter after the desired reading. Once I did this it appeared to allow me to go forward from the start of the chapter. An inconvenience none the less. Not sure if this is common on ebooks for Android OS. For the overall quality of the pictures this is not worth 42.52 as an ebook."
2,Great Content - Superb Photos - Poor binding,"This book would be super for a novice tier with some basic experience. However, like another reviewer here, the book was damaged on reciept. The pages were seperating from the binding as the reviewer reported. I own Essential Trout Flies, an abridged version of the hardback, and love it.However, I reluctantly returned the expanded, hardback version. I hope they do a reprint with better manufacturing q.c."
3,Size Problem,"As much as I like Harley-Davidson boots, I have bigger feet than the sizes listed. I have size 14 feet, and they won't fit into a size 13-EE boot... How the heck am I supposed to get around that?"
3,Disappointed even though Vivrant Thing is bangin'...,"I bought this CD along with Sway and Tech and SoundBombing II. I expected the most out of this CD because of the level of talent. Don't get me wrong there are some very good songs on it. (Vivrant thing by far being the hottest) However, I find myself skipping a lot of tracks when listening to it..."
3,full of solid tracks but no stand-outs,"every song on here is a radio ready hit but theres no bangin tracks with exception of the best group in all of hip-hop, MOBB DEEP. other mobb affiliate, big noyd, rips it on his track but other then that theres no tracks that'll make u keep ur finger on da rewind button. flipmode hold they own and LL finally hits us with another hot track. if ur a radio rap lover then this joints 4 u, but i was hopin 4 sum more bangers outta this lp."
4,Tight Cd,This cd is off da hook it has some reeel tight tracks from MobDeep and Flipmode squad and a super track by Big Pun And Fat Joe called Heavywieghts
4,A Good Compilation,"Violator: The Album is a good compilation featuring heavyweights like Q-Tip, LL Cool J, and Busta Rhymes. There is good production on the album but after the albums very good opening tracks (""Vivrant Thing"", performances by Flipmode Squad and LL Cool J) it starts to wane with only the popular and well-established artists (Mobb Deep, Busta Rhymes, Big Pun & Fat Joe)bringing good songs. Yet, this album is worth the money for those good songs."
2,... needs more Q-Tip!!!,"I was eagerly awaiting this one but.... it just didn't blow up the way i anticipated. Most of the tracks are slow with Q-Tip and Busta providing the some of the few vibin', uptempo beats of the CD! For true Hip Hop fans ONLY!! Where's the solo Q-Tip??"
1,This CD is NOT as phat as it should have been.,"Aside from Q-tip, this album falls way short of my expectations. Save your money and wait for Q-tips full solo album. There is not another track on here worth listening too."
2,Q is the man!..But the album sucks..,"There are only 3 solid songs in this album..So, many stars and so many dissappointment. Q-Tip is the reason why I bought this album and he is the bomb...."
3,"Congratulations anyways, I won't be a hater!!!","It's not all that too me, the only song that I like is ""Vivrant Thing"" , now that is tight to def!!!!!! That song makes me want to get and get so hype especially in the club. But other than that I don't like it!!"
4,A good book for learning the basics of NS Basic,"The book is a little out of date and so does not cover the latest features such as the visual designer. However, if you simply want to know how the language works, it is ideal. The books has plenty of examples and source code is provided on a disk."
5,The book I needed,"A very clear explanation of the basics of basic. good introduction to basic programming for the newton. Fast shipping, item as describerd"
5,Adamo is always a delight,"Adamo is one of Europe's finest and most poetic singer/songwriters. He was born in Italy, but he's known as a French singer, the language nearly all his songs are written in, and the one he seems to be most comfortable singing in...though he has many CDs in Italian, Spanish, and German.His voice has a sweet beauty, and his romantic songs are deeply emotional and moving, but he also has a comedic, lighthearted side to him, as in the humorous ""La Barbu sans Barbe"".The most famous song on this collection is ""Inch Allah"" (""God Willing""), which is like a prayer for peace in the Middle East, and it's a marvelous composition...other popular favorites are ""Tombe la Neige"", ""La Nuit"", and ""Jaime"".Though there are other compillations that have included a larger and better selection of songs, like the wonderful ""Les Indispensables de Adamo"" which would be my pick as his best, this still deserves 5 stars, because Adamo is a one in a million 5 star kind of guy."
5,To better know the man,"It is easy to take potshots at historical figures as long as they remain impersonal. There are some who would like to call TR a racist or imperialist or some other catchphrase. In The Letters and Lessons of Theodore Roosevelt for his Sons, however, you must get to know the person. Even if you don't agree with everything he did historically, you come away with a sense of who the person was and what his priorities, personality, and sense of honor and responsibility were all about. I don't claim to be unbiased, being a great admirer of the man. The letters only reaffirmed what I believed and made me respect the man all the more. The only minor thing that annoyed me about the book was the editor's mention in the foreword about the ""Christian"" character of Roosevelt's stances. Those concepts belong to all people of honor, and are not attached to any given religious tradition."
3,Well ... it depends on what are you looking for,"This Panty is certainly some way sexy, the mesh gives a see-thru look. But from a really hot boyshort I would expect a little more high cut in the back. This panty has a normal cut in the back."
4,A bit big,"I love Melissa and Doug because they use non-toxic materials and you can trust that the product is safe. The picture does not really show how big this toy really is. My baby likes it, but if it was a bit smaller it would be easier for her to bang around, and probably more fun."
1,"cute, but terrible quality","Our daughter was given this toy as a gift and after playing with it for about 10 minutes, we threw it in the trash. The paint started chipping off immediately and there is no way we were going to let her continue to play with it. I've noticed that every Melissa and Doug toy she's had does the same thing. We no longer buy anything from the brand and have asked people not to gift it to our little one."
5,Great Beginning!!!,"This single is a great start for Alley Life, who were probably first recognized by Farmclub, then brought to the game Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2 with ""Out With The Old"". Thats how they got my attention, and it looks like they are heading strong towards more and bigger crowds. Buy this single, it is incredible. Its hip hop beat, and they even have a little rock thrown in, it seems that way anyways."
5,Welcome to the Mo-Mo,"Come on take a ride with Alley Life.Kickin' beats, a groove-worthy feel and a strong set of lyrics make this single worth getting.From the same team that discovered eminem - the Bass Brothers"
2,One star above terrible but missing something added,Movie had professor Renzo Gracie which makes it worth the watch. The plot is a beyond belief I need a movie that is at least believeable. The chief actor Jason Field needs more acting lessons. Maybe he has improved since this movie but in this one he was still an amateur? Anyway there were a few good parts in it but overall I wasn't impressed. It had the expected plot and ending and little believeable about it. I enjoyed seeing Renzo Gracie in it and the girl did a good job acting.
5,ESPN 2005 Sports Almanac Review,"Sports is a huge part of my life, and I cannot tell you how many times I have referred to this book to settle questions and argurments. It gives the information in a no-nonsense manner that I like. I have watched many sporting events with this by my side.Thanks, ESPN.......how did we survive before there was an ESPN?"
4,Hawkwind - 'Live Legends' (Classic Rock Legends),"Just so all you Hawkfans know, this is the exact same Hawkwind - 52 minute DVD as their 'Classic Rock Legends' release of their famed 1990 gig. Sure most of you long time followers are aware of this title - the one DVD where you get to see this particular short-lived Hawkwind line-up of Dave Brock, Alan Davey, Harvey Bainbridge, drummer Richard Chadwick, violinist Simon House and female vocalist Bridget Wishart."
1,Don't waste your money!,I received this knife yesterday and before I could even use it the knob broke off. Now I see why it is priced this low. It would cost more to return it then it did to purchase it so I will just keep the knife part for now. I thought Amazon screened their vendors better than this.
4,Works for slicing my home baked breads,"I didn't buy this for its intended purpose, slicing meats. I use it to cut nice, even slices of bread. It works great! It's very easy to use, just turn the little knob to adjust the slice width, and cut. Keep in mind that it is designed for right handed use, it would be very difficult for a left handed person to use this."
5,Highly recommended,"While I was not convinced this knife would work as advertised, I thought it was worth trying. I bake lots of bread and my husband and children have trouble slicing it evenly. This knife allows a good range of thicknesses and gives good consistent results no matter who is wielding the knife! We are all very happy with this practical inexpensive tool."
4,Deli-Pro Knife,"It would be a 5 if I was right-handed. It's a little more difficult if you are left-handed, as I am, but it works really well. You can adjust the handle to different widths"
5,Gift item,"I got this item for a Christmas gift for somebody and I don't know how they like it yet. I may have to get me one so I can give a better review. I think I would love it for tomatoes, kiwi, and other soft foods that are hard to slice evenly."
1,Lousy so called inventor,"Hey, that guy who sells that thing on T.V. and claims to be the inventor might be getting into some classified provisional patent applications. Check out U.S. Provisional Patent application #60/475,421 filed 06/04/2003 called a measuring knife. It is a knife you know."
5,Deli-Pro Slicing Knife has proved itself in our home for many years.,"We purchased several Deli-Pro Knives to give as gifts as they are the best slicing knife we have ever used. It slices tomatoes, cucmbers, other veggies and bread in beautiful equal portions. We have used it in our home for years and will not have another."
3,ok but not great,I bought this for thanksgiving. It didnt work as well as I hoped it would.It wasnt a terrible purchase just not what I was expecting.
3,Deli Pro Slicing Knife,"I was disappointed. It works great on something soft like tomatoes but anything harder, good luck. The knife isn't sharp enough. Darn."
4,Handy bread and deli knife,"This serrated knife is very sharp. The cutting guide is excellent for slicing bread evenly, meats, cheeses, even cutting fruit like tomatoes. The guide and adjustment knob make it take up more room in your drawer than usual, but this useful tool will more than replace the knives you have to store in other places."
5,Works like a charm.,"I bought this knife specifically to cut my fresh homemade bread. Got tired of the uneven slices of hand cutting it with a knife that squashes it anyway.This worked perfectly! Got the even slices I wanted, and no squashed bread.We've also used it on other things, such as slicing ham, carving turkey....has worked wonderfully each time.The dial to adjust the width of the slice is easy to use. Just be careful not to loosen too much or it just comes off. You can easily reattach it, but just beware so you don't lose the screw or something when doing it.Works perfectly for what I bought it for."
5,great item....even better price !,"If you are looking for a great knife to cut vegetables, meats or bread.....then stop looking and make the purchase of this handy dandy little gem ! I actually use them for our business to cut tomatoes and onions with. The first one purchased lasted a year and a half and was used on a daily basis 7 days a week. So we purchased 3 additional units the 2nd time and paid less for this group of knives than the first purchase. So the staff loves the knife, the boss is happy and the accountant gives this product a thumbs up !!!"
4,The Perfect music for the Perfect Mood,"A personal favorite of mine for a quiet evening with my husband when the kids are asleep and the mind turns to more romantic matters. The relaxing, melodic music herin is a wonderful way to start things off on the right foot with that special someone in your life.This CD, along with a few candles, a bottle of champagin, a bubble bath, or a relaxing massage is the perfect recipie for a lovely time with your loved one.Romantic Classics can also be a great selection to play for stress reduction while driving through rush hour, or just to relax and read a book."
3,Impressively diverse selection,"Any collection of plays has to be judged by the quality of the individual pieces that it has chosen. By that measure, Kozelka has done a good job of bringing together a group of American one-act plays that manages to be diverse and qualitative.We get the plays from a variety of genres and levels of fame; the most famous are Shirley Jackson's ""The Lottery,"" Lucille Fletcher's ""Sorry, Wrong Number,"" and Stephen Vincent Benet's ""The Devil and Daniel Webster.""Each play begins with a short (two or three paragraph) biography of the playwright, which is a nice way to give some context to the selections. If you are looking to put on a one-act play, this is a great set from which to choose; alternatively, if you just like to read plays, the shortness of these fine selections makes this a good shopping stop for small tastes of different authors."
3,DENNIS THE MENACE,"TYCUS is a mess, I agree. Footage from other movies...a stiff performance from perennial bad boy Dennis Hopper...why haven't other scientists acknowledged the comet....why is Peter Onorati so dumb he can't see what's going on? And why did Chick Venerra as Onorati's partner disappear and not contact him?However, I must admit I'm a sucker for disaster flicks and even if the stolen footage isn't the greatest, I found this movie mildly entertaining. Onorati is a good actor, though this is not his best role. He did very well in DONOR UNKNOWN. Finola Hughes as his wife didn't have a lot to work with, but a valiant effort nonetheless. And remember Amy Steel from the first FRIDAY THE THIRTEENTH? She has a cameo as a nasty mother who uses her child to steal Onorati's truck! That's entertainment, folks!"
2,Oh Boy!,"This is one bad flick. You can tell Dennis Hooper was unconfortable making it. The hero, who was a brainless brawny jerk who had no common sense, only made things worse. Come on, the earth is going to be distroyed, the hero needed to get his act together. It started out OK, but it quickly got bad. There were some good looking babes in it though and the special effects wern't too bad for a low buck flick. While some may feel it has a lot of merrit for a low budget film, the average joe is gonna be kinda dissapointed."
2,MOVIE EFFECTS FOOTAGE FROM OTHER MOVIES,"Wow... before I rented the movie, I looked at the cover & the back description(different from this one displaying on this page).. From what I read and saw , I expected to see tidal waves, tornadoes, etc... instead, none of that was in the movie.....Now, the FUNNIEST part about this movie was that they have used footage from movies like ""Asteroid"", ""Dante's Peak"", and ""Armageddon"". The most I recognized were the collapse of the bridge while the volcano was erupting (Dante's Peak)..and the nightscene where an asteroid hit Dallas from the movie ""Asteroid"". And all of a sudden, the movie ended...WOW. I just could not believe and did not expect this movie to use footage from other movies than creating the whole thing on their own.It was disappointing."
2,What an Evil movie!,"This movie is as lame as a rock. Nothing good is in this movie. It has almost no special effects of its own. Absolutly nothing.All it has fo earthquakes is when a man is sleeping the earth moves. For Volcanoes. A Lavav Flow from dantes Peak, For Hurricanes a segment from a National Geographic film. Then for the Asteroid. They take seens from when An Asteroid hits the dam in Asteroid, A meteor hits what a bridge that collapses in the movie Dantes Peak, And a seen from new York in Armageddon. I only gave it two stars for some of its own (sOME OF ITS OWN) special effects. Bad Movie. Don't let the cover fool you."
1,What was Dennis Hopper Thinking???,"Some movies are so bad that they're entertaining, but Tycus doesn't merit that distinction. Tycus is simply bad. Stupid plot, amateur dialogue, poor acting, unimaginative sets & a ""made-for-TV"" feel all contribute to an exceptionally boring (the worst thing a movie can be) 94 minutes -- that is if one can hold on for that long. Dennis Hopper is a great actor, but he should do some jail time for appearing in this stinker."
4,This architect practices what he preaches,"I live in a neigbhborhood with several buildings by thisarchitect, and he indeed practices what he preaches. Whathe preaches is that modern architecture has become too inlove with creating monoliths that do not harmonize with thebuildings around them, which he then teaches architects howto do. I wish more people would listen to him."
4,Almost too many shapes/sizes,"These blocks seem very durable and are lovely overall. There are almost too many shapes and sizes, however, to the point where you might have to dig deep to find a specific type when building something. For a younger baby or young toddler especially, I would recommend getting a more standard set of blocks."
5,Wonderful Toy,I was very pleased with the Haba Block set. The blocks are nicely sized for small hands. In addition the blocks are very smooth and actually feel nice in your hand. Bought these for my grandsons and they love them.
1,jewelry making kit,"I purchased this item for my daughter for Chrismas. Unfortunatly this was not what I expected. I was unhappy with the selection of beads, and unhappy with the fact that the item smelled heavily of cigarette smoke. I ended up going to Michaels and put together our own kit for thirty dollars more that included and full set of quality tools in a zipper case, double the amount of beads, plenty of string and wire, and plenty of findings and clasps. I was even able to purchase a beading class for two people. However, when I returned the item the seller was very helpful and returned the full price of the item and the shipping. They were very helpful."
1,Never Received item!,"This item was never shipped to me after it was paid for, so I wouldn't have any idea on how it is!"
2,Waste of money,I got this for Christmas. It reeked like cigarettes and the beads weren't as nice a quality that you'd expect for the cost. I definitely won't be ordering from Jealous Jewels again.
2,Dollhouse pieces,"These were about dollhouse sized. Not what I expected, but okay.I had a little trouble getting shipping information, but everything arrived in good order."
4,Different From What I Expected,"For such a short book (and maybe because it's so short, and I tend to read several at one time), it took me a while to get through this one. But once I got on a roll, I'm glad I read Breakfast at Tiffany's. I've never seen the movie, but I expected the story to be much lighter than it was. Still, an interesting story.I also enjoyed the short stories also included in this book, and was especially intrigued and moved by ""A Christmas Memory."" I loved the writing in this one. For instance, the way Capote described the look and smell of the coins was amazing, I thought. The relationship between the two main characters was poignant."
5,Delightful Reading,"If you enjoyed the movie ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"" this is a book you should read. If you have not, but have enjoyed other stories by Truman I believe this gives a wonderful insight as to who he is."
3,I don't get the gushing,"I found this book rather irritating. I have never seen the movie and I think I would be bored with it.Yes it is well written and quite a smart story however Holly Golightly is an irritating, self centered immature girl. Certainly not a young woman even if she thinks she is.I don't quite get what the gushing over the movie is other than the sex appeal of Holly and the fantasy she depicts."
3,So Now I Know the Story,"I bought this book after a discussion with my daughter about Audrey Hepburn's Holly Golightly. It was a good, quick read and reading it resolved the disagreement we had about Golightly's character."
3,I actually prefer the movie.,"As a huge Audrey Hepburn fan, I have seen this movie countless times. I love the movie...so I was surprised with how different yet similar the book was to the movie. Holly Golightly is a blonde with short hair in the book!! She's supposed to be Audrey Hepburn with her beautiful dark brunette french twist! The movie version is set in the 1960′s whereas the book is set in the 1950′s!I liked the book. I can see why Capote is on so many must-read lists but I don't think I can say that this will go down as one of my favorite books. I can imagine that it must have been scandalous when it was first published in the 1950′s. It's kind of one of those books that I am glad I can now say I've read and put it behind me. I may have enjoyed the book more if I didn't have the film version so deeply ingrained in my mind, though."
4,Excellent,"I read this book because I absolutely LOVE the movie, Breakfast at Tiffany's with Audrey Hepburn. The book is excellent and there are distinct differences between the book and the movie, of course, but neither the book or the movie is harmed by these differences. Audrey Hepburn was a brilliant Holly Golightly! The story, Breakfast at Tiffany's is very interesting and very well written. (of course, Hollywood had to change the ending!!)Also in this book are three short stories that are very interesting and a bonus to the reader.I highly recommend this book. It is excellent!"
3,Breakfast at Tiffany's,"This is a difficult book for me to sum up. It had GREAT characters and the story was interesting too, but was also a bit slow in places and confusing at times. After seeing the movie, I can understand why Mr. Capote disliked it so much, it was NOTHING like the book. Two totally different endings. Overall, a good, quick read but for me NOT a must read."
5,Brilliant and entertaining read,"As soon as this book begins, you fall in love with it. Holly Golightly, the main female character,is described so well, and it made me wish that I knew her! Capote writes an entertaining and riviting story, highly worthwhile book."
4,Desultory,"I found ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"" a desultory story with un-engaging characters. The whole thing - plot, character interaction, atmosphere - all seemed rather flat in my opinion. Perhaps it was the bohemian nature of the story - it just didn't do anything to me. I finished it because it was short, only over a hundred pages in my edition. Longer would have been prohibitive!However, there were three other short stories added. These were wonderful! They were ""House of Flowers"", A Diamond Guitar"" and ""A Christmas Memory"" where you can taste the food! These had feeling, emotion and tension, altogether lacking in ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"". (These three short stories brought my rating up to four stars.)"
5,I Love Truman Capote's Work,"Breakfast At Tiffany's is a shining example of the genius that is Truman Capote. In all writings it seems you're always bound to fall in love with the characters and world he has creates. Recent films like Infamous and Capote have tried to show the world what Truman was like, but in truth the only way to get inside his head is to read his works and understand that this short, encentric,and always flamboyant man had wisdom and values that he fed us though his books and today contiuly define American culture."
5,One of the best ever!,"Truman Capote's career began and ended before I even learned to read. Somewhat of a new discovery for me even though I grew up with my own dvd of Breakfast At Tiffany's. His writting style is beautiful, lyrical and engagding. Breakfast At Tiffany's reads as good as the movie (or vice versa) thankfully! The additional stories are amazing in how different the characters and storyline is - and only underscores his talent as a fiction writer. Brilliant."
3,Breakfast at Tiffany's (may have spoiler),"This is a great book and defiantly well written. I saw the movie and loved it, so I decided to try the book to see how it compared. As it turns out the book was not as good compared to to the movie, the ending was disappointing and lacked the impact that the movie had.I am not saying that the book wasn't good, but it defiantly wasn't as expected. So if you absolutly loved the movie as I did, you may not be too impressed with the written version."
3,Fun read,"This was a quick fun read. Holly Golightly is of course the perfect name for this character. Read the book and then see the movie. For a change, think the movie was better"
3,Breakfast at Tiffany's,"The character of Holly Golightly is well known to many from Audrey Hepburn's portrayal of her on film. (I have not seen the movie, but I suspect from what I know of it that its tone and storyline differ markedly from that of the novella.) Holly, a ""lopsided romantic"" in the author's words, is a charming but self-involved, irresponsible, and sometimes mean-spirited young woman with a murkily unpleasant past. She attracts wealthy men to her easily and, in some vague way, makes her living from them. Among those who fall in love with her is the narrator of the book, a neighbor whom she calls ""Fred""--her brother's name. ""Fred,"" prompted by the report that she may be in Africa, writes about Holly years after his acquaintance with her has ended. His story suggests that she has managed to charm a new continent-load of men and to land on her feet again, cat-like.Reviewed by Debra Hamel, author of Trying Neaira: The True Story of a Courtesan's Scandalous Life in Ancient Greece"
4,Different than the movie,"This was a very good book, but completely different from the movie. I really don't know which I liked better."
5,Another jewel for Christmas reading,"My book, a new-looking, small volume of only the three holiday stories, and published by Modern Library, was just the ticket for after-Christmas, quiet-time reading. Where and how I came by this book is unknown. Though the stories, ""A Christmas Memory,"" ""One Christmas,"" and ""The Thanksgiving Visitor"" all use the same characters and the same setting--a small boy and his ""66-year-old friend"" in Alabama, the events described by Capote were different. He is a master of words and descriptions, especially applied to nature. Nowhere in the listing of Capote's books is this collection of three stories; perhaps under Modern Library it can be found. This tiny book is a peek into Capote's writing that is delightful. Recommended."
5,Cheers to Truman Capote,"It's true, Audrey Hepburn and George Peppard are fabulous in the film. But the novel is a masterpiece. Capote writes an exquisite tale about the most endearing characters that I have ever met. Indeed, the novel reveals such a deep complexity in Holly's character, that I stop seeing Hepburn in the title role while reading the book. Instead, a new Holly emerged that is much more than the beautiful party girl that we know and love from the film. Her outward appearance of independence and vivaciousness conceals a deeply confused person with a troubled past that she is determined to defeat.I must admit, I do prefer the Hollywood ""happily ever after"" ending. Still, the novel left me hoping that Holly would someday find that place that feels like home. A wonderful read that I highly recommend."
4,Magic!,This wonderful novella has lost none of its magic over the years. Capote is an extraordinary writer and Holly is one of his most memorable and enduring characters. Forget the film - read the book!
4,Timeless Pleasure,An enjoyable and quick read. Capote delivers a dramatic and comedic storyline that offers a glimpse into the life of the characters. I thoroughly enoyed this read. The short stories at the end are a delightful bonus. Each is unique and exquisitely descriptive.
5,Opened my eyes to a whole new world,"I didn't know it was possible to love reading until I found this book my senior year of high school. My assignment was to do a research paper on one American author, and I chose Capote knowing very little about him. Over the semester, I learned a lot about Capote, but it would be Breakfast at Tiffany's that kept me coming back for more. I chose to focus on this novella and his short stories as well as his personal life for my paper. The book supposedly based off his relationship with a certain Hollywood starlet reminds you that sometimes none of us know where our home is, and we are able to seek solace in the fact that Holly makes it seem not so bad sometimes. Yet, we know that she is a very lonely woman. Breakfast at Tiffany's opened my eyes to a whole new world, and I couldn't ask for anything more from any form of writing."
4,Vivid characters,"""Breakfast at Tiffany's,"" by Truman Capote, is a story about a woman named Holly Golightly. Holly has a charming and witty personality that everyone adores. She constantly struggles with herself, trying to find her perfect place, like Tiffiany's, a jewelry store in New York, but there just isn't one. So, she keeps searching.The characterization that Capote uses really makes the characters enjoyable to read about. How Holly reacts to the events in her life tells the story. This intense characterization of Holly, her moods and the way she behaves, makes the book easy, quick and enjoyable to read."
3,Disappointment,I was really looking forward to reading this book and was disappointed in it very much. It is a classic story but kind of sad. I was overall disappointed in the plot of the story and the way it was written. I did not feel the language used in it was necessary.
1,Nonsensical,"I read the reviews on this story, the 5 stars and the 1 one, but I thought I would give it a try. Wish I hadn't.What does nonsensical mean? ""Having no meaning or direction or purpose."" Exactly what this story represents. There is no depth to Holly Golightly's character. She talks in trivial roundabouts, is selfish and did nothing but try my patience. The narrator is flat, a wimp, and has no backbone. The story consists of mostly dialog, giving the reader no sense of being there. When I read it, I was thinking ""blah, blah, blah"" the whole time.As a librarian, I really do give every book I read a try, but I felt this story was nothing but complete DRIVEL!"
1,"Spiritless, Pointless, Meaningless","This is a book of vacuous characters who do nothing. The plot goes nowhere while it follows Holly Golightly everywhere. While engaging in an endless round of socializing, she fails to endear herself in any way. I would certainly not waste my life chasing this shallow bimbo. The film version of ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"" must have been a success because the entire script was rewritten to include only the original title. I give this book 1 star only because it was so mercifully short."
1,Don't get how it can be given a 5,"Ok, so I know I'm probably alone on this one, but it's one of the few books I have read that I would not recommend. I have never seen the movie, so maybe I missed some link. I found it was lacking any form of structure and I think some of the language was dated (of course seeing when it was writen) and maybe some ""American"" terms that because I am not familar with I missed the point. However, I did get two quotes out of it and it was a short read so not a huge time investment to loose."
1,This book stinks!!!,I didn't care for it at all. I had to read it for high school and I couldn't even begin telling someone what it was about. I didn't understand the point of the story and now I will probably have to write a paper on a book that I don't know the meaning of.
5,"Beautiful voice, music, and lyrics in The Road Home!!","Brenda Harp's crystal clear voice has a power that reaches out and captures your soul. Accompanied by awesome musicians, she sings her heart out on these inspirational songs. The words, the harmonies, and the music blend beautifully. The Road Home will certainly be tops in my collection."
4,If Everybody Looked the Same!,"This tune is one that should not be avoided when buying music. It captures you to think, and makes your realise what life is all about...One to think about!"
1,Its Garbage,Dont bother buying this mouse. It worked for two days and then broke. Hasnt worked since and I cant get my money back. I even wrote the manufacturer and they were absolutely awful. (this wasnt purchased thru amazon...tho i should have because they stand behind all sales).
2,"Appearances are Everything, Even When Destitute","This was not a horrible book, however there was never a true relationship established between the hero and the heroine. I liked Gina but her constant ""there is a silver lining"" attitude became tiresome for me. When I think of a good romance I think of books by Judith McNaught, Madeline Hunter, and Stephanie Laurens (although she can be repetitive). The characters in those books develop relationships that are truly founded on for better or worse. In order for the reader to feel the connection between the hero and the heroine it needs to be experienced with them and not told in pages upon pages of internal reflections. Dialog is very important in developing the characters, it provides interaction and sets a tone for the book. There was not a lot of dialog in this book. A few lines here and there but a good portion of the book was internal thoughts."
3,Exceedingly pleasing historical romance.,"Exceedingly pleasing historical romance. Lorraine definitely knows her craft well. I am not going to go through the plot since so many already did that; however I will add that I found the heroine quite outstanding. Her willingness to go through hell just to make amends for her father's mistakes is astonishing, this is the part of the novel that I liked the most, she is just so human. It is quite compelling often what we as woman are willing to go through just to make others happy. I found the hero quite unforgiving. His realization of his love came a bit too late for me. Overall, it was quite a nice read."
5,Still the Bible of cat sailing,"I haven't had time to read much of it yet, but so far very informative and I will be a whole different sailor when the warm weather returns. Make sure your crew read this too so you're both on the same page."
3,New Recommendations Supplant the Info in this Book,"This book is good in its underlying theme -- take antioxidants b-carotene, vit C, vit E to counter free radical damage -- but, evidently, its specific recommendations are outdated. Two sets of antioxidant dosages are recommended, a small dose for ""health and longevity"" exercisers, and a large dose for ""athletic"" exercisers, where the dividing line between types of exercisers is 50 aerobics points per week. Dr Cooper's latest recommendations, which can be found at cooperwellness.com, change the small and large dosages, and the dividing line has been changed to 150 aerobics points per week."
3,A Word to the Wise . . .,"For years, I've been a big fan and follower of Dr. Cooper'saerobic exercise program. Nevertheless, I'll advise caution beforeundertaking Dr. Cooper's prescription for anti-oxidantsupplements. Dr. Cooper's recommendations for Vitamins C and E and beta-carotene are remarkably similar to those criticized as being without scientific foundation by a recent (April, 2000) Institute of Medicine Report.The prudent reader will consider the Institute's report before joining Dr. Cooper's revolution..."
4,30 ton press,Product worked as intended. The base part that supports what you are pressing in or out was twisted. I think it can be fixed pretty easy. But it did what I needed it to. The price was good and I expected the quality for the price. I would buy again. Jon
3,Very Reputable Brand - works well at this price point,"I've had these for self-head shaving for about 2 years. Generally they work quite well. As with most head trimmers, you MUST adjust the power input as directed (read your directions!) to minimize vibration. Over time these have seemed to get louder with more vibration and it might simply require another adjustment on my part (which I have yet to do). Only REAL critique is that the #0 blade guard broke (several teeth broke off when dropped) and I cannot find a replacement for it."
4,Good for practice,For cutting friend & family hair I was very happy with these clippers. Used them with & without the guards and they work as good as ones that cost much more. After the cuts people would not know they was cut with clippers that cost less then $13.00 wow!!!! Money well spent
2,Not what I thought,"This is how this item is described:This device crushes, dissolves and administers medication and water. Easy to follow instructions enclosed.Nowhere in the product description does it indicate that this item is for animals and not humans. This syringe is huge! I can't even use this for my 30 lb dog-it's way too big!"
1,Junk,"I have owned a R-2120JW for a little over a year and it has recently ceased to function. It will not heat.I purchased it because of it's large capacity and no turntable to deal with.However it seemed wrong to just place the food on the bottom. There is a stainless steel wire shelf provided so I installed it and put the food on the shelf.Sometimes I noticed the food like a potato would be burned where it touched the wire. Once a hotdog arced through a paper plate and burned a hole in the paper plate. Once something arced through a paper towel and it actually had a burning ember glowing in the paper when I took it out.I think the shelf must overload the system and it has caused the demise of the oven. So now it is headed for the junk heap.Don't waste your time and energy installing this short lived, poorly engineered unit over your range.Why isn't it possible to give a product no stars? That is what I would give this one if I could."
2,Did not fit right,"I bought these because they were discounted (under $20).I own another pair of Fly Flot shoes called ""Jazz"" and I am veryhappy with Jazz. I thought these shoes ""Dana"" since they looked verymuch like Jazz to me. I must say they may look a likebut they are very different when you put them on. Dana sit higheron your feet and feels very stiff. I have foot problem one of myheels hurt so may be I am more sensitive than others. I just wouldnot buy these shoes again."
5,foot comfort,"after the birth of my fourth child, i woke up every morning with extreme pain in my feet and ankles. i obtained a pair of these shoes and wore them every day. when i put them on as i was getting out of bed, they made it bearable for me to walk first thing in the morning. as i wore them throughout the day, the pain began to decrease day by day. i have no pain now when i arise in the morning. these shoes were like walking on clouds. i love them. i have owned the same pair for over 2 years now and the only thing that needs replacing is the insole. other than that, they are still wearable."
2,O moderate cd.,"This cd 17 tracks; some tracks are quite nice in a traditional way (like Virgenes de Sol), but some other - most of them - have a more modern style and approach. I didn't like them. This cd is not for a traditional peruvian music lover."
3,Perfect for Party,This is a must have if your having awine tasting party or for a wine enthuses. It's perfect palm size and has lots of useful information. I purchased 20 of them for a wine tasting event and they were a hit!
5,SO small SO cute,"It doesnt have that much information, but the book is interesting, it worth the money"
4,Excellent but song list is wrong,"Of course the music on this CD is great, but I was surprized that the song list on Amazon did not match the CD I received. Missing were ""I'm Sorry"", ""He's Mine"" and ""One in a Million"". In their place was ""You'll Never, Never Know"", ""I'll Never Smile Again"" and ""Enchanted"". The change was break even for me: I lost ""I'm Sorry"" but got ""Enchanted"". Too bad the CD didn't have both plus ""On My Word of Honor""."
5,"Put the Platters on your platter, and I do not mean 78's","If you were born after 1945, get it. If you were born before 1945, why ask. Corinna"
5,best of the best,the platters at their very best !! great sound quality--great love songs from one of the greatest groups of all time--i am so glad i purchased this cd .
5,THe Best of the Platters,"The sound, the best songs, the best singers - all captured at their peak. Wonderful! THe classics could not be sung better."
5,The Platters,"This C.D. brings back a lot of memories, ""The Platters"" were one of my favorite groups in the 50's and 60's, love listening to it."
5,The Best of the Platters,"I was completely happy with this order and the way it was handled. The product lived up to my expectations. For anyone who remembers the Platters, this is just as you remember."
5,Any age should get this.,"If you were born after December 31, 1959, buy it. If you were born before December 31, 1959, WHY ASK!"
5,Terms of Engagement,"Linda Austin has written another book that challenged me to think ""outside the box"" in finding the life I wanted. She writes with insight about relationships that only an experienced therapist can bring to the table. I especially enjoyed the chapter on engagement, a concept and set of behaviors that were key to my finding the right partner for my life after years of feeling trapped in the wrong marriage. Thanks, Dr. Austin for helping me find the life I wanted."
3,Budget Edition Of The Savoy/Dial/Verve Master Takes...,"No documentation comes with the set, but all is common material with clear sound. All tracks are in chronological order, and a quick internet search for Charlie Parker sessions will get you started. The price is certainly right!Discs 1-4 Savoy/Dial Master TakesDiscs 5-10 (First 5 Tracks of Disc 5 conclude the Savoy/Dial material). Rest is identical to the Verve Master Take Box Set."
5,There Is Documentation !!,"Wonderful box set AND there IS documentation! Go to www.membran.net and find the set/box ""Charlie Parker - Now's the Time "" and click on ""Labelcopy"" which lists the songs on each CD and then lists the sets (location-date-personel). With some creative/selective printing (regular letter sized printer) ie, both sides, turn over, etc. I can get all set information on 2 sheets, trim the long ends of sheets back near printing, fold twice and slip into the box with the 10 CD's."
4,Same as Past Perfect,"I would claim that this set is identical to the box set from the Past Perfect series wrt the audio tracks (Charlie ""The Bird' Parker: Portrait). Listen to track 2 on disk 4 for instance: there is exactly the same annoying digital glitch in the beginning of the trumpet solo. The difference is in the packaging. The Past Perfect series are packed in a huge box with each CD in separate plastic cassettes. This set fits in my jacket pocket, which is convenient. Also, there is a very nice booklet with the Past Perfect set. The digital audio remastering is decently done, although by no means perfect, and I enjoy listening to these tracks again, of which I knew many from older LP versions. And the price can't be beaten. The Past Perfect is a bargain too."
5,4 plays at Great Value,"This book was a great value and tool for my son who is studying acting. Four well-known plays by William Inge in one book. This book shows the variety of Inge's work and will be good for him to know. His acting coach recommended he familiarize himself with these plays so it was at great savings also - buying one book, instead of 4."
3,Czech Republic - The Heart of Europe,"A fair travel guide of the Czech Republic for someone who plans to be a first time visitor. As a former resident of the country for over 20 years, and frequent traveler to the country during the post Iron Curtain years, I was somewhat disappointed in the disproportionate time devoted to some sections of the country to the exclusion of numerous other worthwhile sites completely missed. As an example, too much time was devoted to the coverage of Karlovy Vary (Karlsbad). Less emphasis on that part would have allowed coverage of more historically important sites. So, in that sense, I tend to be more critical and feel the travel video fell short of its potential..."
1,So bad it's almost funny,A waste of money and time. The credits were more entertaining than the movie. The movie was such a bore it made me snore. It is a waste of the five seconds it took us to figure out how boring it is.
4,Good fan,"Moves a lot of air across our wood stove. One lower speed would be nice. I call the three speeds, Hurricane, Tornado and Tropical storm."
1,way too noisy and not good for home use,"this fan is more like an industrial fan - the lowest setting is very very strong, it makes your hair blow like crazy. the worst part is the noise, you cant carry on a conversation with it on. we had it in a room 25'x25 and it was horrible. it does not oscillate so you never get a break from the wind and it does not cool the room only what it is directed at"
4,Unexpected joy,"Although it's listed as a journal, I guess it never really sunk in that it WAS REALLY A JOURNAL! I know that may sound ridiculous, but it's really a journal with lots of fancy paper and questions to answer as you go on a sacred journey of self, following the Sacred Contracts format. If you have already read SACRED CONTRACTS and are familiar with Caroline Myss' interpretations of Chakras and Archtypes, then this is a wonderful tool to help you put it all together. It's a fun and beautiful gift to give to yourself or anyone who is a Myss fan."
4,Journal for the Journey of Your Soul,"I find this journal to be really helpful in following the work I am currently doing with Caroline Myss. It provides a format that is portable and a structure that directs the work well. The things in the book could be put together individually from other sources, especially if one is working with Caroline's books, but it's nice to have it together in this very attractive package."
3,"Need ""Sacred Contracts"" to use this book","The author repeatedly states that the reader should refer to her previous book ""Sacred Contracts"" for more detailed descriptions of the exercises. I will have to find that book in order to fully understand her concept of the ""contracts"" we make with others."
4,concise,"This guide is a concise and fairly informative pamphlet for those travelling along the Maine coast. It is very inexpensive, and does not take up much space, but covers all the lighthouses one might run into along the coast."
4,"Handy, But....","This guide will surely come in handy, but as someone has already stated, real lighthouse pictures would have been better than illustrations.Still, I wish I had had(?) one of these for directions to lighthouses in other trips we've made to New England. So many are really hard to find...especially for tourists!It was ""as advertised.""Thanks."
3,"Professional Map, Amatuer Illustrations","The map and information provided are quite good, but the illustrations are disappointing, I would have rather seen photographs."
3,"Food so good, sad story though","I loved the part with the meal. Yes, good food. Excellent reactions to the presentation of the dishes at the final table scene but everything else I could do without."
3,Sweet and sumptuous...,"This sweet little film will make you hungry for a nice big Italian meal. Great performances all around and a fun soundtrack.The problem with it, ultimately, IS the simplicity of the story. Rather than tell us something important about the relationship between two immigrant brothers, it ends up being little more than a long pilot movie (albeit a very well done one!) for ""Big Night---the sitcom.""Even so, it is a fun way to spend 109 minutes...which is all this DVD has to offer."
2,Naptime,"Somebody with undue influence over my husband told him this is a really excellent ""little art film"", so he rented it. Set in the 1950s, it's a slow-paced tale about two brothers from Italy who must face the demise of their restaurant. The food looks good, and there are one or two moments that would have been touching if I'd actually cared about the characters. I'm glad we didn't pay to see this in a theater, as it was much easier to take lying down."
4,The Big Night,I really enjoyed this movie. The story is about two brothers who are from Italy and trying to make a success of their restaurant. The one brother is very old school and believes in tradition. The other believes in changing with the times. But the y are not doing well. There is a lot of fun watching them prepare food and lashing with their ideas. The acting was well done by everyone. It made me want to try and cook some of the food they made! I can say this is one of those movies I can watch again and again.
2,"Love Tony Shalhoub, but REALLY??!?","I love Tony Shalhoub and had heard great things about this movie, but it never really got started. I understand that people like the relationship between the brothers and that the last scene (I won't give it away) was wonderfully done, but this was a truly boring and pointless movie. If I were looking for an excuse to get hungry, this may have helped, but as entertainment this slice-of-life film left me wanting."
5,why is this movie not available on DVD?,Does anyone know? It's so wonderful and so well-regarded. I can get virtually anything else on DVD -- and often for less than $20 -- why can't I get Big Night?
4,People should-a come just-a for the food...,"Primo (Tony Shaloub) is a traditionalist, a perfectionist, an artist; he is a chef without compromise. His younger brother, Secondo (Stanley Tucci), will compromise, bend, wheel and deal; he is a desperate businessman who cares about food, but is realistic. Unfortunately, their little restaurant is way, way ahead of its time. When their 1950s customers go out for Italian food, they want red-checked tablecloths and lotsa spaghetti and meatballs, not risotto and delicate wine. How can their restaurant stay in business? It can't, but they try to save it with an all-out feast for a famous Italian jazzman. If you're the least bit hungry when you watch this film, you've got trouble, because food has never looked this good. It's a quiet, slow movie, but you get to know Primo and Secondo completely, and you find yourself wishing their restaurant was in your neighborhood so you could go there and give them all your money."
5,Great movie!,"As ""Like Water For Chocolate"" defines the Mexican experience, ""Big Night"" does the same for the Italian immigrant. A touching film about two brothers and their struggles both with each other and the new world. The eldest brother, Primo, played by Tony Shaloub, shows a true passion for his food that elicits laughter, admiration, and empathy. And the food!! He cooks up a veritable feast, culminating in a Timpani that will have you salivating like a padlocked dog.Stanley Tucci plays the younger brother Secundo, who worries about more practical matters, like paying the bills. He and Primo go 15 rounds over the menu, produce, and every other little detail.If the crescendo of the movie is the all night feast scene, its denoumont is the next morning. The love exhibited between the two brothers is obvious and moving.The film features a soundtrack starring jazz great Louis Prima. Wonderful stuff that will inspire you to buy the soundtrack as well."
4,Worth watching,"No action heros , no state of the art special effects , no sex and no violence . Just real actors playing real people in real life situations . Wonderful and convincing cast especially Tucci , Holm and Rosellini , but you have to single out Shalhoub who gave a brilliant performance ."
5,An absolute delight,"Watched this wonderful movie 3 times the first week after I received it - each viewing revealed a new dimension to the storyline and the intricate relationships among the characters. The music was great, the cast superb, and the movie wonderful. If you're looking for action pass it up. If you want to lose yourself in a subtle, humorous and realistic story rush out and get it."
4,A very human movie.,"This is a wonderful movie- but you have to expect a quiet movie. The characters are very human, and their interaction is remarkable. The struggle between the two brothers, and their struggle together is very well played out.If you love food, you'll love this movie. If you don't love food, you'll come away from it wishing that you did cook, and with an appreciation of how natural the actors are with the food."
4,Entertainment,"It's a good movie. Read the critics review for the plot. This is a movie without hype. You get to see the guy from ""Wings"" and ""Stark Raving Mad"" play a challenging role along with Stanley Tucci."
4,Italian Evening In.,"Big Night is a movie you can watch multiple times and enjoy. Make an Italian pasta casserole, open some Chianti, and have some friends over for a great tv dinner evening in.Good actors and acting make Big Night a treat."
5,"great music, food and conversation...what more could you wan","THIS IS A FUN FILM! And a well-made one too. It's worth seeing because of the great blend of music, dialog and personalities. Most especially the two Italian brothers and their affection and humor is a wonderful experience to be part of. And you do get taken in. Its like the great food and wine and music...It is contagious. Do yourself a flavor...take a taste."
5,A movie that you can sink your teeth into!,"This is one of those fabulous movies that you can pop in any time that you want to be entertained. It's touching, it's funny, it is familiar. It is done with a well-known cast of actors that bring meat and potatoes to the story. With Tony Shalhoub and Stanley, how can you go wrong?"
4,Gripping,Very interesting premise. Keeps you fascinated to the end. Characters were well thought out and they drew me in. Great.
4,Shame,Once again I'm delighted with Alan Russell. Great story teller. He has always managed to keep me interested and wondering how he was going finish!
3,Different,"An interesting premise, although I figured it out about midway through the book. The ending was also abrupt, lots of buildup for a brief ending. Average."
2,Shame,"The idea behind the book is good, but the treaatment is shoddy. Serial killngis not a father to son legacy. An the suppose expert in the book as so much prejudice to shame herself. And the conclusion is a bit o much extreme."
3,SHAME was not a shame!,A 5 star book is one I read straight through because I can't put it down...they are few and far between....Shame was well written with personalities remaining consistent and it made sense. I found no discrepancies (no typos! or words left out). At some points the story was a bit difficult to follow but all in all I enjoyed the read.
3,Entertained,"Despite the dark subject, this book is a light, quick read. You will certainly be entertained. Nothing more, nothing less."
4,Worth reading,Anyone who enjoys a good murder mystery will like this story. Very colorful characters and unexpected twists and turns will keep you reading.
2,Pretentious,"A light-weight psychological profile of three people - a murderer, his son and his biographer. Disjointed timeline and improbable action. Interesting premise but disappointing."
4,Quick easy read about a serial killer,Mr Russell writes in a narrative way. Kits if So. Cal references. There us a plot within a plot. The killers spoke like Hannibal Lechter which was unoriginal.
2,Shame,"This is just not the type of story I prefer. It was formula written all the way. If you like blood and guts, you'll probably like it."
3,Disappointed,"It was kind of a slow read. I had to almost force myself to keep reading in some spots. Didn't like it, but read it all."
3,Not bad,A little quick in parts and too detailed in others. Great story with some new interesting questions. Glad I read it
4,Shame a review,Liked this book very much - subject was so different that it kept your attention. It was a very good who - done - it with unexpected twists.
4,Connor's Thoughts,This thriller was so exciting! Once the ball started rolling I couldn't put it down! Highly recommended to any reader looking for immediate excitement
5,Excellent Read,"What a wonderful read. I couldn't put it down. I haven't read any of Alan Russell's other work, but I will now. I will be recommending this book to everyone. Enjoy!!!"
1,Did not enjoy,"I found this book really hard to read. It just didn't keep my interest and sometimes the ""flashbacks"" were a little hard to follow. I would not recommend."
2,Good read,Good read and i dont know why i have to write a number of words required review and i cant just speak my
1,"Poor writing, flat plot, filled with cliches",Once again Mr. Russell outdid himself. His last book The Fat innkeeper was one of the dullest mystery stories even published -- one wonders why the publishers keep on putting out such drivel.Mr. Russell: please keep your day job.
2,"Starts interesting, becomes a train wreck","The story starts off interestingly enough to draw you in and make you forgive the robotic, stilted dialog and one-dimensional characters. About two-thirds of the through the novel, though, it feels like Russell just gave up on revealing what's going on through the events, and characters start vomiting out long explanations of the plot in prose that sounds like they're quoting from a newspaper article (or in the more painful cases, from self-help books). Which doesn't matter, because you'll have figured out most of it long before the revelations). Once the plot grinds interminably to its resolution, there are a couple of less-obvious big reveals - but at that point, the characters have become so uninteresting and unlikeable that it's hard to care. Then it finally ends, and you think. ""Well, at least it was only three bucks."" It's really shame (ahem!) because the premise is really good."
2,"Good concept, rushed execution","I liked the concept but felt the characters were rushed. Some spots lacked descriptiveness, such as murders. Author would sometimes go on tangents."
3,Shame,It started out great became predictable and than long winded.it was a great topic but fell in to the sea of predictability.
3,Enjoyable,"Overall, Shame was an enjoyable read. However, at times, the story fell short in believability of the character's choices and behaviors."
3,Review,"Good book. Well written. Some parts of the narrative seem too focused on expressing the characters emotional reactivity. Overall, an interesting read."
4,Shame,Good book. Enjoyed the reading content mystery suspense kept me reading and interested excellent I would buy another book from this author
4,Enjoyed!,"Kept my interest. This is the first time I read this author, but I will definitely read more of his works."
3,Overwritten but still readable,"Great premise, good plot lines, extremely good writing but way too much descriptive detail that didn't contribute to the enjoyment of the book. Cut 100 pages of prose from this book and it's a five star effort. As it is, found myself skipping pages just to get the story moving along. While the story line is interesting and the heroine is a likable character, it could have progressed much faster than it did."
2,A waste of time!,This book took forever to get to the point. Way too much going back in time and way too much useless detail. Unexciting and a waste of time.
3,Good read,This book started a little slow but ended up as a good read had some good twists and plot line enjoyed the characters.
4,A great read,"This book will keep your attention. interesting characters, fast pace and unexpected twists and turns in the narrative. You will enjoy this book"
5,Definitely a Thriller,"Shame by Alan Russell will captivate any reader of murder/mysteries right from the beginning. It is the story of the son of a notorious serial killer, who has spent his life trying to hide who his father was. The writer who helped to make his father, Caleb Parker, famous is drawn into the investigation of a series of copy-cat murders that the police are all too ready to blame on Caleb, Jr. Protected by a man/woman named Lola, the son and the writer finally uncover the identity of the killer. This novel will definitely keep you turning those pages.I read this specially priced Kindle book for about $2. If you are patient enough, you too will find some entertaining reading on Amazon for just a few dollars."
2,Not a page-turner,The storyline is not what I hoped it would be. Kind of slow and not really any type of excitement.
5,good book,"this book was very good, good plot. holds your interest all the way through. i had never read him before, but will again"
4,Good Read,"Lots of plot twists, fast faced and enjoyable without too much gore. Ending left me a little sad though. Overall a realy good read."
4,Shame,Good book keeps you guessing. Drags in a few places and some characters could have been better developed. Would read Alan Russell again.
4,Good,A little confusing between all the changes but a great read none the less. I would highly recommend it to anyone who likes mysteries.
2,This one didn't work for me.,"The writing was good and I loved the premise, but I found the execution somehow flawed. Maybe that's because I liked Mr. Russell's premise so much, I was disappointed to see how it actually played out in the story and plot.One disappointment, for example, was in the backstory relationships between the main characters. These were reveled with craftsmanlike skill, but oddly, rather than adding color or suspense or tension to the story, they seemed to add a distracting dissonance.As I read the book, I guess I just thought there was a better story there than the one that was told. It does make me curious, however, about the author's next novel."
4,Good book very enjoyable happy with selection and cost,"enjoying book, first time with this author, I will look for more books by him . in the near future"
2,Too contrived,"I sped through this as the overly contrived plot lost my interest and the intervals got lengthy. May look at other books written by this author, but doubt I will buy."
3,It was a struggle to get interested and not very entertaining.,It took a long time to get into this book and I am not in a hurry to get back to it to finish.
4,Fast Paced,"A long awaited book from this author since Multiple Wounds.In this story, the main character is the son of a serial killer. New murders have the same MO of his father who ""rode the lightning"" 20 years ago. A writer who wrote about his father gets involved in these new murders and finds that the person who discovered one of the bodies is the serial killer's son. When the police find out the link, he's on the lamb.While the killer's reasoning is a little off (to me anyway), Alan Russell's writing is face paced and he provides a good twist at the end.Well worth the read, but his other book, Multiple Wounds is more expertly written and researched."
3,Decent read. Entertaining enough,Decent read. The story carries through at a nice pace. The characters are explored sufficiently to make them believable. Entertaining enough ! I'll recommend it.
5,Worth your time.,"The book has an interesting plot line. It keeps moving, is fast paced and mostly pretty interesting. Didn't bog down."
4,Well written book,This book was a fast read that kept your attention as you were brought into the mind of a serial killer while searching for a copy cat.I would recommend this book and look forward to reading others from Alan Russell.
4,Good read,I enjoyed this book. The story was very good with some twists that kept it interesting. A little wordy in some areas bur still a good book.
3,Shame Plot Drags,"The premise for Shame is promising but the actual plot drags a little. Not to say that there aren't some surprises, it seems to take too long to reach them. The book does have some interesting and different characters though."
5,Great book,Very Suspenseful it kept me guessing who was the real killer written good great story! Going to read another of his books
4,Whodunit,Kept me guessing right to the end. Well done. I look forward to reading more from this author. I almost think the work may have been written by a female because the heroine was totally believable to this guy.
4,SHAME,like to read mystery/thrillers. SHAME KEPT MY ATTENTION AND I COULD NOT PUT IT DOWN FOR VERY LONG AT ONE TIME. WOULD RECOMMEND SHAME TO ALL WHO LIKE A GOOD THRILLER.
5,loved it,Shame by Alan RussellLoved the book!! Kept me on my toes to what will happen next.Can't wait to read the next Russell book.
4,Sobelle,Well written and flowed. Entertaining. Would recommend to others that enjoy murder mysteries with a psychological twist. Would try this author again.
1,Bad quality - too cheap,"Second charger i buy. First one lasted for 3 months, but the second one only for a week. Crappy quality. Won't buy again from same seller."
4,Keeps her busy from 4 months to 7 and counting...,"I bought this assortment of toys to bulk out my daughter's toy collection at age four months. She is now seven months and still plays with these toys (some more than others). They're good for taking in the car or keeping in a specific room where you need to keep the baby busy for a bit (laundry, your room, etc) and they're easy to pick up and get out of the way. I have not experienced paint chipping like the reviewer before me, but we haven't had these all that long. Overall I am pleased with this set."
2,Useful for first-time visitors,"I found this site guide to be worth having along on my first birding trip to Costa Rica. The sites are well-chosen for diversity of species likely to be seen and the checklist showing relative abundance of species at the top birding sites is very helpful in eliminating similar species during the identification process.Rather than the long lists of some possible birds to be seen at each site, I'd have preferred to see some more specific information about locating each site's more important species, a la the Lane birding guides. I felt entirely too much space was devoted to these lists which largely duplicated the info from the checklist."
2,Not for iWork 8,"Keynote 2 for Mac OS X (Visual QuickStart Guide)I guess I was expecting info on the latest version of Keynote. Under chapter 1, ""Installing Kenote"". It says Installing ""iWork 5"". Too bad it doesn't say somewhere in the description that it's for iWork 05, not iWork 08. I'm sure it will give me a good start anyway."
2,Not the color I expected,The color of the product I received is nothing like the picture! If you want Royal Blue then this is the case for you.
2,Poorly designed,"I own the 9-piece Kitchenaid Clad set. They are all great except for this piece. The lid does not fit well. This is hard to describe however when the lid is on, you can push it into the saucepan, i.e. when pushed to the side, you can see inside the pan... it's too small I guess! Also, the steamer (KitchenAid 2-1/2-Quart Stainless Steel Clad Steamer Insert) doesn't fit well which leads to the steamer tipping when on the saucepan.Ultimately, this pan is disappointing when compared to the other Kitchenaid Clad products."
4,They fix a problem,BE1-2 Electrical Outlet Box Extender 1-GangThey do what they are supposed to do.Flimsy but do the job.If your box is not out where it needs to be this will fix it goes inside old box so the hole size will not matter.
3,You get what you expect,"I bought this for my 4-year-old and it works as well as could be expected for some plastic adjustable skates. Obviously, you'll want to make sure the area your kid is skating around is clean of debris with a smooth surface. I don't anticipate my daughter using them for a very long time, so I would say the price is about the right value for this type of item."
1,Size 10 Tennis Shoe does not fit in these skates,"My daughter loved the gift but her size 10 shoes do NOT come close to fitting inside these skates. DO NOT BELIEVE THE SIZE 6-12 RANGE, it does not go beyond a 9 shoe. (I tried some old sizes.)"
5,Perfect Companion for the Book,"If the book ""Love Talk"" appeals to you, I strongly recommend you buy this companion workbook. The exercises here help put into action the principles presented in the main text. This little book is a wise investment in moving closer towards ""Love Talk""!"
3,A decent collection of fantasy stories,"Legends is the first of Margaret Weis' thematically linked stories from ""The Eternal Archives."" The linked material is a very slender and slight suggestion that all of the stories are culled from a mystical Library.The Stories themselves range in tone and subject, from Lindskold's treatment of a Chinese mythological fable of the white tiger to stories of subjects as diverse in subject as Ancient Egypt, and a water-nymph infatuated with a U-boat Captain.A decidedly mixed bag of tales, slightly better than average on the whole."
5,GREAT book!,I bought this for my daughter who is 5 and she loved it. We were able to match many flowers in the book to her delight! I was so sorry when I can in here to see it was out of print! What a great book for a child in any location. PLease reprint this book!
5,Sarina,"This book is very green and senuous. I adored all of it, And a woman gave birth! Big, big rating"
4,Henry lives on,"In my youth I read all of Henry Miller's books, finding much that was amazing, boring, sexy. ""Henry and June"" does about the same. Ward and Thurman as is the wife. No doubt Henry's life may have been less exciting than his imagination, I expected more sex than it showed which was Miller's preoccupation. And he played around a lot more than the movie shows.But the atmosphere of his life and of Paris were there. An ambiance prevades the story line which explains somewhat his reason for writing gritty life scenes. Worth watching."
3,"Interesting movie, regular edition","I purchased this because the R2 european edition doesn't have spanish subtitles. Both editions have regular-to-bad video and audio trasfers, what is quite disappointing because this movie's cinematography is lovely.Seldom [wrongly] clasified as soft erotic, the movie itself is quite appealing, specially for those interested in Anas Nin and Henry Miller figures and artists life in Paris at late 20s."
4,Henry & June,"Henry Milller (""Tropic of Cancer"" etc.) had to wait 27 yearsbefore his first novel was published in English; perhaps if he and Anais Nin had not met we might never have met the literary voice of Henry Miller. Henry and June takes place in Paris where Henry first met Anais Nin, June Miller (Uma Thurman) arrives somewhat later and Anais is quite fascinated by herand the frivilous Henry. Fred Ward really does an outstanding job as Henry and Mana de Medeiros as Anais is simply superb but they all fade away somewhat when Uma Thurman comnes on the scene; she as the street-smart New Yorker, complete with a decent accent, commands one's attention. It'a fine film and there is also an appearance by Kevin Spacey. Richard E Grant as Hugo, Anais' husband rounds out an excellent cast. I think this film is worth your time.John"
3,Ok for the first viewing,"I was highly disappointed with this movie. The first time I watched it, I'll admit, I did enjoy it. But upon viewing it again and again, it came to my attention how wrong things were portrayed, how facts were turned around or even left out, most likely to make the story more interesting for us 'viewers'. Uma Thurman as June was a horrible call. She looks nothing like June, and she left a very bad taste and cold feeling in me watching her in this. Fred Ward, however, as Henry Miller, was as near, physically, one can get to Miller and Maria de Medeiros was a perfect Anais Nin, physically and personality wise.I would recommend viewing this if you don't care about details and want an introduction to the life of Henry Miller or Anais Nin, but anything more than that, I'm afraid, it fails."
3,Very stylish film,"A very good looking film, with good acting. Unfortunately the movie loses momentum in the middle and never regains it. If you're familiar with Anais Nin and this period of her life, you'll enjoy the film a lot more. Kaufman really doesn't succeed in letting us get to know the characters very well. Frankly I thought the sexual scenes, which got the movie it's NC17 rating, could have been left out without any damage to the film. If you're expecting a film mainly about sex, you'll be disappointed.It may be more style than substance, but it's done well enough that it's enjoyable. Kaufman creates a lovely vision of Paris in the '30s, and as mention, the acting is top notch."
3,A good primer for reading Henry Miller's books,"This movie is a good primer for reading Henry Miller's books... in 1991 I watched this movie and was drawn in by the charisma of Henry Miller's charcter played brilliantly by Fred Ward... I thought, who is the charasimatic one here? Henry Miller or Fred Ward... it turned out that (taking nothing away from Fred Ward), Henry Miller is as charasimatic (if not more so), than Fred Ward's portrayal here. Uma Therma plays the part well of June (or Mara), and Maria de Medeiros is a dead ringer for Anas Nin. That said, the movie is a little sluggish in pace, so it requires some patience to sit through, but it does have some great (redeming) moments..."
1,Deserves a worst director's award!,"I read about this movie on Amazon first and decided to rent it, thinking a romance happened in Paris, in the 1930s, can't be bad. What a disappointment it turned out to be. Kevin Spacey has a small and insignificant part. But Spacey fans should definitely avoid this one. Uma Thurman is one of the female leads but this must be an insult in her career too."
2,Drags On and On,"This account of the life and love affair of Henry Miller and Anais Nin seems endless. The director attempts to show character traits and development via an endless parade of sexual liaisons, which becomes more than tedious after the first hour and a half of the movie. Henry, June, and Anais deserve better."
3,Seemed Dated,"The girls get sensual. The guys are props or toys. This one is for the girls. I'm surprised a big star, Uma Thurman, early in her career, no doubt, she really gets into it with little Maria de Medeiros. I found myself fast forwarding through the love scenes for three reasons: seen one vintage lingerie scene, seen them all, with the advent of accessible adult fare there's no reason for this stuff in mainstream art films, my own mature life is just as interesting and sensual. This is a problem for modern directors and writers. We've experienced it all, lived it since the 1960's, so what's so special about the activities of Bohemians in 1931?To be fair, I liked Tropic of Cancer. I read it not too long ago. My only complaint, it seemed dated somehow."
3,Technical Note,The DVD is in 1.85:1 not 1.66:1 aspect ratio as indicated on the package or by Amamzon.
4,A captivating look at the self-realization of a young woman.,"This adaptaion of the diaries of a young Anais Nin in the 1930s details the relationship that formed among author Henry Miller, his mysterious wife June, and Anais.Henry and June take Anais on a journey of self-discovery and freedom, all without the knowledge of her husband Hugo. Deceptively sweet, Anais appears to be the manipulator in this erotic journal of exploration.The cinematography is stunnning, captivating the shadows and mystery of the content. Unfortunately, the plot is slow-moving at times, yet it manages to maintain your attention with various sensory stimuli.I enjoyed the film because of its journey. It had an intriguing plot without being overly blatant with its sexual expose."
2,Flimsy if used indoors!,"We purchased two of these plastic pens..and it was a big mistake! We tried to set them up in the 4 x 6 rectangle dimension and the door sags forward terribly. It is not sturdy for inside use unless maybe if it is in the octagon shape, then perhaps a little more sturdy..but still not worth the money spent. I would send these back to Amazon, if I hadn't opened them. Quality is much poorer than I expected it to be. I wish I had never ordered them...in my opinion they are a huge waste of money."
3,Need to improvise,"This is good quality, but the door hardware is a little flimsy and not neccessary. I had to improvise and leave 1/2 of the screws out in order to allow the pen to fold in or out. It would be better if all of the panels were hinged, not screwed. Then, the door wouldn't be neccessary."
5,A winner!,"This is well built, easy to put together, looks to be very durable and you can disconnect one section to colllapse and store. A winner!."
3,not quite ideal,The overall product is a bit on the flimsy side. I had expected it to be much sturdier. A couple of the parts included were incorrect not even close to fit or function. I e-mailed and did receive the correct parts fairly promptly. Would only recommend for extremely small dogs only. My dog is about fifteen pounds and he just about bulldozes it over.
1,Disappointing.,"This book is recommended for third graders. I was very disappointed when I saw the actual spelling words used. My third grader was spelling the same words in the first grade. If you have a third grader who has a hard time spelling, then maybe this is the book for you. The average third grader should be spelling the word ""chill"" (lesson 1), ""bark"" (lesson 25), and boot (lesson 31--from the very last spelling list in the book) already. This is not a third grade level book!!!"
3,Claaic Nero,"For readers who have followed Nero Wolfe this is a nice retro-read. For new readers these mysteries are classic ""who don-its"" with a number of suspects; challenging the reader to solve each mystery. Post WWII New York City area is the setting for these 3 stories and Nero uses his cerebral skills to solve them."
2,Too big to entertain,"I have wondered why there is always a female sidekick with The Doctor. Waters of Mars made it clear for me.The sidekick can be his person to talk to about his perspective and emotions. With a sidekick there is someone to persuade him into action. The sidekick will notice something that he does not, so that he can be limited to something like a human perspective and still save the day.Here the Doctor goes on an adventure to Mars without a female sidekick. He is conflicted and feels sympathy for the victims, which he would do with a sidekick.Here The Doctor winds up talking like a god, and everything that takes him away from being a person, instead of a god, makes him less interesting to watch. It is akin to watching Bill Gates win the lottery."
3,Bad Science,"Overall, not too bad. However, near the end, when the rocket explodes and burning debris lands all around the good Dr, there is no way this could happen on Mars which has no appreciable atmosphere and no oxygen in the atmosphere. Pretty cheesy. Will miss this version of the Doctor."
5,Limits of a Time Lord.,"One of the best Dr. Who episodes ever. The last ten minutes is the reason for my high rating. Tom Baker is my favorite Dr. and those episodes are my favorites, but the consequences of the Dr's actions at the end of this episode was stunning."
2,"A great plot, but a really bad script.","This story had such potential. The plot is actually really scary, but instead of getting a chilling and action-packed story, we get a boring runaround with way too much drama, not enough suspense, and too many things that just don't add up. I found this one just awful. And it could have been so great too. If only the writers were more interested in creating suspense rather than drama.Not recommended!"
3,Soars like a weasel,"A very slow moving, poorly written story in which US and Nazi operatives agree to kill their leaders to assure peace. Contains a number of basic spelling and grammar errors that add another level of annoyance to a mediocre book. An OK read but not one to hunt for."
5,John Mellencamp / Rough Harvest (Rpkg),"I was positively surprised with the different acoustic versions of known successes from Mellencamp. I refused to buy this CD before, because I thought it was a simple selection of original recorded music, but it's much more than this."
3,"John ""talks"" the lyrics, slows the tempo.","I was disappointed at best. Mellencamp ""talks"" the lyrics to some of his greatest songs, slows the music way down, and throws in some off-beat rhythm to ""spice"" it up. The only saving grace on this CD is ""Farewell Angelina,"" which has the same heart and soul to it as a cross between ""Scarecrow"" and ""another sunny day 12/25"" (Dance Naked). I would recommend a buy, but don't expect it to be one of your top 5 favorite Mellencamp CDs."
3,Rough cuts.,"I'm a big Mellencamp fan and seldom find fault with anything Mellencamp does but ""Rough Harvest"" is very much a contract fulfiller. The problem with these songs is that Mellencamp re-did them in 1997 and most of them turned out mediocre the second time around. I do like ""Between A Laugh And A Tear"" and the songs Mellencamp covers like ""In My Time Of Dying"", ""Farewell Angelina"" and ""Under The Boardwalk"". For the most part ""Rough Harvest"" is only for hardcore Mellencamp fans who are completists. What Mercury records or Mellencamp should have done instead of re-doing lesser known songs is put out ""The Best That I Could Do: 1989-1996."" It could have contained all of Mellencamp's best tracks from ""Big Daddy"" through ""Mr. Happy-Go-Lucky"" all digitally remastered with a bonus track or two thrown in."
2,Rough Listen,"When Eric Clapton re-recorded Layla, he sounded refreshed and inspired and thus gave us a true reinvention of his classic song. On Rough Harvest, rather than reinventing his songs, Mellencamp strips away all identity and charm and leaves us with a set of tired and listless songs that sound far inferior to the originals. Rough Harvest is a disservice to both the artist and his fans, fulfilling nothing more than a contractual obligation at the expense of those who bought this album."
3,Not exactly what I expected...,"I'm a John M. fan because I love John's voice, along with his lyrics. I was prepared to hear a new sound to my old favorites and I was pleased with the new renditions. However, I felt John's vocals were often overshadowed by the female vocals on this record. I felt like saying, ""sing out, John - a little louder!"""
5,Simplistic Harmony at it's Finest!!,"Ever wonder what it would be like to see John Mellencamp in a venue so small you could reach out and touch him? Close your eyes while listening to this CD and you are there! This is not an album for those who wish to hear the same songs made popular by radio airplay, but rather for those of us who enjoy live music. His interpretations are so intimate, it is almost as if it were an impromptu performance given at a family gathering. Experience a raw, crisp performance that only Mellencamp can deliver!"
4,Classics to Hits,How to sum up this CD; well here is a mellow rendition of John Mellencamp's hits. The liner notes talks about times when soundchecks and rainy afternoons the band took the time to for themselves to play what they felt. From the use of violin and acoustic guitar John Mellencamp's Rough Harvest reinvents itself through slowing down the tempo of what made these songs hits.A must for any John Mellencamp fan who enjoyed Big Daddy and Huma Wheels
4,JM @ his best.,"CD (music, movies, etc..) are tough 2 review, it's a personal preference. If U like John Mellencamp, Then U wont be disappointed."
2,Not the right size,This bridge is VERY tall. The width is right but the bridge raises the strings about 1/2 inch too high. It is also very thick giving the violin a muffled tone. I bought it to fix up and sell a student violin. I'll have to cut it down and sand it thinner. Pay a few dollars more if you dont want to do any woodworking.
4,It Is A Good Book Especially for Beginners,"Or if doing just a couple of home projects or need a little different inspiration. Also Melanie provides you with not just the instruction, but excellent stencils, brushes, DVDs and even classes now and then!"
5,A MUST have for the serious decorative painter,"After looking through it briefly in a bookstore I decided to buy. I found that on a second, more thorough reading, there are so many tips and details that only someone with a great deal of experience and artistic vision could describe. This book has it all! From very simple stenciling to the intricacies of shading, shadowing, layering, perspective, mural building and more. The step-by-step directions and project photos are are well written and invaluable, with some humor to keep it fun! My personal favorite is the faux limestone technique - who would think you could create realistic ""carved stone"" with stencils?! Highly recommended for the decorative artist's library!"
3,fantastic walls,I watch a lot of decorating shows and although I get great ideas I never have enough time to soak them in so that I can remember the step by step technics. This book allowed me to open to a page grab the paint and go to town while reading. I was however looking for something alittle more sophisticated. Most of the murals were beginner. I rate this a three because while it was a good book I think my personnal expectations were higher than what I got.
4,"Cute Game - great for kids, too easy for Disney addicts.","I love the Scene It franchise so when a Disney edition was available I was thrilled, however I was disappointed with how simple the questions were. As most of our family and friends happen to be Disney addicts, getting the questions right was a breeze.That said, this would be a great game to play with your kids as it isn't very difficult and being the Scene It brand, is also all around fun.As a note if you're looking for a challenge, Trivial Pursuit has a Disney edition that includes a wide spectrum of difficult questions."
3,Game is fun but...,"Pieces came broken. I was lucky I had spare parts to play the game. If i didn't, I'd be in trouble."
4,It works,Really this is the best value for the money that I could find. The stake holds tight in the ground. My only complaint is that the ring sometimes doesn't spin feely enough and my dog can get wrapped around it a bit. But this is a problem with every one of these I have ever used. There are no signs of rust or breakage after two months. Good product.
4,Effective for the recommended size dog,"Works effectively for my 50 lb. husky, just make sure you get the correct stake for your size of dog or she will pull it out of the ground! The only problem with this stake is that it's kind of hard to get into the ground since you can't hammer it in, especially if your ground is hard."
5,Cider Mill Spiral Tie Out Stake,Use the Cider Mill Spiral Tie Out Stake for our doxie so that he can move around more easily. The Cider Mill Spiral Tie Out Stake is not only for used with a cider mill which I have never seen or heard of.
5,PEANUT,"GOOD SOLID PRODUCT FOR THE PRICE...I USE IT AS A SAND ANCHOR FOR THE STERN OF MY BOAT, WHILE THE BOW IS ANCHORED NORMALLY....IT KEEPS THE BOAT IN ONE POSITION ...GOOD IDEA...LUV IT..."
1,Poor Manufacturing,"Judging by the reviews, I must have got a defective tie down. The bottom of the screw portion is cut off flat to the ground instead of at an angle. This means there is nothing to help it go into the ground. This makes it impossible to get it into the ground properly. I'm 6'2 220lbs and the best I could do was get covered in sweat, a very sore hand, and a 2 inch deep corkscrew size hole drilled in my yard. This makes my tie down completely worthless without major retooling."
4,"invisible cable, eh?","The product description declares ""Petmate Stake comes with an aircraft grade cable, which is galvanized and coated with crack resistant vinyl, imparting it strength for handling tough usage.""This item came with no cable of any kind. I suspect the description was wrong, or the product used to be something else.The stake looks pretty tough, the connector looks a little weaker. I'll update if it fails as others are reporting (pouch is only 38lb and probably couldn't stress something like this)."
3,good,heavy duty but only works when someone super strong puts it all the way as far as you can possibly force it into the earth.
5,Works great,Holds my dogs well and pretty easy to insert into ground. A great item to carry in your trunk when you go to the park.
4,Good show...,"This is a good show with a lot of good songs... including old favorites. Sure they don't move a lot... but hey! It's DOOM... not Thrash Metal. I have DVDs from Therion, Nightwish, Gamma Ray, Candlemass, Helloween, and Iron Maiden... and it's still nice to have some more doom for a change."
1,boring,"i love this band ,but this dvd might be a mistake for these guys.they barely move onstage & dont put on much of a show.plus the slows songs are all together then the faster ones are together so it makes the setlist not flow very well..."
2,Good Sound - TIme to give it up.,"I'm not too familiar with Solitude Aeturnus music, but i am a fan of dark gloomy heavy stuff. I had heard a few songs from this band, and thought they sounded good.The DVD has excellent sound, the music isn't too bad, but i feel like i'm watching Spinal Tap while this thing is on. It's almost comical the way these guys who are at least in their mid to late forty's snarl and do the devil sign while acting crazy. It way too silly for me.I should have kept just listening to the band, and never watched it.Save your money, and buy an audio CD. I should have.Candlemass they'll never be.They also chose a venue in Poland where it seems more than three quarters of the 200 people there, are waiting for another act to come on and they could care less for Solitude.Keep putting out good music Solitude Aeturnus, just don't make anymore videos. You look just plain silly."
5,"Excellent product, excellent price",This glass washer is a great product to have behind ANY busy bar. We run it almost constantly throughout the night and it runs like a champ. I'd recommend them to anyone.
5,Another great graphic novel,"As i have written for Goldfinger, this one is no different. As mentioned in another review here; a great companion to the novel. i have started collecting the entire series."
1,Wonderful adaptation of Fleming's Novels,I grew up reading these strips in the newspaper when I was a little kid in the 60s and the 70s. I bought this book when it was first published by Titan Books in 1989. It was a wonderful presentation by Titan in high quality paper and a beautifully painted cover. The stories are engrossing and the artwork by McLusky is superb. I would recommend this book highly to any James Bond fan.So why do I award only one star to this book? Titan decided to include Moonraker in this book. People like me who have already purchased the earlier edition of this book have to buy it again just to get the extra Moonraker story.
5,Bought it for the cover art ...,"... and keep playing it for the exquisite cuts. I'm usually leery of compilations - there's usually a dog or two among the group - but this one is absolutely fine from top to bottom. In fact, these are some of the best renditions of these movements I've ever heard. There are some truly breathtaking moments here ..."
5,Teenage Idols from Disky,"This is a good box set of early 60's popular music, plenty of variety and lots of big names like Del Shannon, Fabian ,Dion etc,as usual no Elvis but still plenty of good music. These are all original versions, The Disky releases are top quality and are good value.I am surprised this appears to be out of print,but guess it must be sitting in a lot of CD collections ,including mine.cheers, Peter"
5,These pens are awesome!!!!!,"Love these pens. For as much writing that nurses do, its great to be able to pick different colors. Jazz up some boring charting."
5,Great Pens!,These are some of the smoothest pens I have written with in a long time! I haven't had them very long so I am unsure of the longevity of the ink.
4,"Really useful, colorful, saturated colors","I love these pens...they've lasted me for almost a YEAR now (I admit I don't use them daily, but still!)The colors are vibrant and saturated without being too heavy - but that I mean it does't bleed onto the back page.My only complaint is the design of the stupid case. It sucks. Its plastic so naturally, it breaks after repetitive use. Getting to to prop up and stay is a challenge after it breaks, and snapping the lid back to place stops working after a while."
5,Triplus Fineliner,"I love these pens! I've had my current set for about 3 years and I use them all the time. They have just now started running out of ink, especially the colors I use most often. I use these for note taking, like many others, and use them to color code the things I'm studying. I have pages upon pages of notes taken with these pens, on power point slides and just blank pages. About to buy my third set of these and can't wait for a fresh box! <3"
4,My son won't take them off,"I got a great deal on these Geox, and my son absolutely loves them! I was having a hard time getting him to wear anything other than Crocs until I found these. He's hard on his shoes, and tends to poke holes in the toes from crawling around pushing cars and trains on the floor. These have a wrap around rubber toe protector that has the shoes still looking great after a couple months of almost daily wear. I would definitely purchase again!"
4,Pretty good wall rack,"I have this mounted on a wall and use it to sort and hold mail at home. It works well for this. You could also store a few files or magazines in it if you wanted. I take off one star as it is not the most refined product. The ""mounting holes"" are spot welded washers. Works OK but looks a little cheesy. Also, there is a slight bounce to the rack as it only mounts with two screws at the top. It needs a bottom screw or at least a rubber bumper."
2,Dimension off of the wall is incorrect,"We could not keep this wall rack because the listed dimension in the online description and the product packaging is incorrect. It extends much further off the wall then the 4.5"" listed. Therefore the rack did not fit in the space intended. We're sad because it is a nice rack and would have helped us organize our mail and magazines."
3,overpriced & half the shows,"I just bought the video brand new, with both the ""Pumpkin"" & the ""Christmas"" specials on it (60 minutes) for $23 including shipping. I know I'm not permitted to link where but just ""google"" on the pertinent names & the site comes up readily."
5,Happy,Install was easy and straghtforward. Quality is top notch. It hauls the 5th wheel on air now. Smooooth!! Love and recommend it!!
5,Belongs in every serious music collection,"A stellar collection by one of the giants of traditional accoustic blues. Recorded a year before his death, this 3-disk collection of Bill Broonzy's favorite blues songs showcases the great blues musician with a clear and modern recording and a great blues artist still at the height of his abilities. Each of Broonzy's selections is introduced by the artist himself in a studio conversation with interviewers Bill Randle and Studs Terkel. Broonzy's intoductions add a history and depth to the recordings, to the history of the blues, and American roots music and African American history in general. I can't rate it high enough."
1,Absolutely worthless,This product is absolutely worthless. Earpiece constantly falls out of ear at slightest movement. Dont bother buying this.
4,Funny and frightening,"I came to this novel after seeing the film. I read it, enjoyed it, and didn't think much else of it. I reread the novel in an English Lit class wherein we dissected the use of dialect, the choice to not have a central character, and the somewhat unredemptive closing. Trainspotting's tough going for the first few pages, but once you're accustomed to the varying dialects represented, you'll find yourselves entertained and shocked by the stories within. This novel is gritty and uncompromising in its representation of contemporary, Scottish, working-class youth, so if you're unfamiliar with the subject, or with Welsh's other works, take warning."
4,Feverishly Good,"I really, really like this book, but I honestly had no clue what was happening until somewhere in the middle, where I finally understood (somewhat). I will tell you this right now: you most likely won't understand until near the end. That's when all of the pieces will fit together. This book deserves more than 5 stars. The reason why I gave it only 4 stars is because of the dialogue... which confused the hell out of me! The characters are Scottish, so it took me a couple minutes for each page. If you don't mind struggling a little bit, then give this book a try. I think that you will be glad that you did."
2,It's not the movie...,"While the film version of Trainspotting presents a rather slick, humorous version of Mark Renton's life with the needle, the book devotes perhaps a third of itself to a more realistic one. For example, Diane has no condoms, and Renton is raped while he's passed out by a dirty, neurotic man. Its scope is much larger than the film's, encompassing perhaps three times the number of significant characters, and weaving their stories together in a way that keeps the reader feeling as confused as nauseous. I liked it on the whole, but too much of it felt disjointed and irrelevant for me to really enjoy it."
3,"Like most addicts, hasn't aged well","..and speaking of books that were *way* overrated on initial publication, I submit this as the most unjustly overpraised book of the nineties. Film hasn't aged too well either. (caveat Ewan McGregor.)"
1,a humorless novel about a group of Scottish drug addicts,"The hype this novel recieved was way overblown. I can imagine teenagers getting all pysched up about this, but if anyone has ever read James Kelman, Willam S. Burroughs and Samuel Beckett, then you may have some understanding as to what I mean. Basically, this book is a complete rip off of the three writers whom I referred to. Besides this fact, it is also humorless. But this is not say that Mr. Welsh isn't a good writer, because he is. It's just that he doesn't shine in this book. Try The Acid House."
5,"It's good, ya ken?","What a cool, modern, intense combination of light and dark. As an American, I was discouraged at first by the thick Scottish dialect and this is why I think some people wouldn't stick with it, but the minimum amound of perseverance needed to get into the rhythm and colloquialisms of the speech is well worth this book. While some scenes are just plain black (heroin use is portrayed extremely realistically and tragically), some other parts are absolutely hilarious. I laughed out loud several times. Very enjoyable and a great piece for my generation."
5,"Great Story, Great Writing",Trainspotting could be the best book I've ever read. The characters are fascinating and the story is exciting. Highly recommended.
5,Love/Hate relationship,"SO much better than the movie, I can't even begin to explain. I've seen the movie countless times and read the book at least twice as many times. It's funny, sad, disturbing, confusing, painful, and so well written that by the end of the book you love the characters and hate them at the same time."
4,Too true: Trainspotting extends beyond the ordinary,"A keeper has to whack you. A book you buy on a lark and then keep forever has to change how you think, how you see the world. Trainspotting whacked me. If it were only a description of the world as a ""bog"" (ie bathroom) it would be fascinating in a journalistic way. But it's a bog with a purpose, a challenge of morality turned sideways, weird survival in an unsurvivable world. The story is always >going somewhere<. That energy, that need to make something >new< happen, that's the whacking part. I was dragged along kicking and screaming. Also read this book and Sheperd's Bush will start to make a whole lot of sense."
3,Trainspotting only skin(pop) deep,"Welsh's use of dialect and the first person seem to immerse the reader at once into a strange and lurid new world, but his weaknesses as a writer are apparent if one looks for them. They are most prominent when he tries, and fails, to keep up the inertia in the third person, or even when he drops the slang (as in the tiresome ""Bad Blood."") A closer examination of Trainspotting reveals just how much Welsh relies on the gimmick of dialect to keep the reader interested: ""translate"" a few sentences into plain english, and see how uninspired the prose is. Phonetic mispellings does not a masterpiece make; if Welsh's story was truly as universal as people say it is, it wouldn't need them."
5,Literary Excellence,"Welsh's ""Trainspotting"" is a wild ride through the minds and lives of this group of Scottish junkies. This is a novel that will transcend time and become one of the most popular cult books ever. It is as vivid in description as it is in Scottish-drowned humor. The Scottish dialect only adds to the remarkable essence of the book. Soon, the reader will be speaking as one of the characters. The movie, though terrific in its own right, hardly does the novel justice. The reader is forced to look at the problems and lifestyle of Mark Renton, Sick Boy and the others. It's as close as one will ever get to being strung out on smack and living in a pit of desperate measures for their next hit without having to actually shoot up."
3,What did he say?,"I don't doubt that this is a treffic book with and message. But I couldn't over look the fact that I can't understand what the author is saying. Oppose to telling you the character has a thick scotish accent but writes with an accent. REad a few excepts, you can't understand what the characters are saying. I know I couldn't. I thought at first thta I could get use to it, but by the 50th page I only understood about 1% of what I read. I'm american and we have a more nasal accent. I simply don't understand this book."
1,"The Desecrated Souls of the Common Youth, at there prime!!","This book was written for attension, and sadly because of the obsessive nature of modern man, it was a ""hit"". Well, for anyone looking to read a good book, this is not a great example. In this cliche of a world there are many who can write to change the ""great popular tide"", but lets look closer at what our society calls brillience. Trainspotting was an instant classic, but in my opinion, in the ""not-so-great"" collection, which will resonate in future years as a typical 1990's book (is this how we want to be remembered?)."
1,What is the big deal?,I have never understood the big to do this film has caused. It is absolutely awful. I rented the Video with high expectations only to turn it off half way through. It reeks.
5,the end of meaning,"Trainspotting affected me as did ""Black Like Me"" - now I understand. I think that this book conveys true cultural insight - difficult task, rarely accomplished. Made me afraid to have a pint in Edinburgh, though."
5,"the movie is a mockery, compared to the book...","if u saw the movie and liked it, then read the book, & u'll once again start h8ing film directors & producers. after reading the book, the movie looks like a mockery, or a bad unfunny parody of the original story. this is by far the best of irvine. it takes a couple of pages 2 get used 2 scotts' language, but after that, it'll b hard 2 stop."
5,Eclipses the Stellar Film,"I read this as Gestalt therapy after a friend OD'd. Contrary to popular opinion it doesn't glorify heroin addiction but, rather, caustically villifies it by simply showing it how it is. Dark, gritty, yet incredibly funny Trainspotting (the novel) totally eclipses what was a fantastic film. If you loved the flick (and who in Gen-X didn't?)then you'll want to read the book if only because so many hilarious scenes were left out of the former. Whilst the phonetically accented writing is initially hard to decipher, after a couple of chapters you won't even notice it. Simply stunning."
5,This book will have you thinking in a Scotts dialect.,"One of my all time favorites. I couldn't put it down. I found myself thinking in a Scottish accent for days aferwards. One of those books where the characters feel like real people. Where you find yourself wanting to converse with them. Careful readers will be able to identify each character by his thought and speech patterns. The Movie is good too, but read the book first. You won't regret it."
1,Want your children to cuss and learn to steal things?,"I checked this book out because of the cute cover page. As I read it to my 2 and three year old I began to realize that this book simply encourages children to lie to adults, not listen to their moms,steal things and shout ""bad words"". HELLO as if my job as a parent isn't hard enough. Don't get me wrong, I'm not strict and I was a naughty kid but no one ever wrote a book celebrating my naughtiness. What is up with this book?"
1,stay away from this book,"In life there are consequences to behaviors and actions. But not in this book. This book makes light of unacceptable behavior. There is no resolution, no correction, no explination that positive expierences can not come from these bad choices. What a waste of time and money!"
3,Old edition,"Be aware that this is the 2001 edition of this travel guide and therefore restaurants, hotels, etc are somewhat out of date."
2,Not working,Our new kitten is climbing curtains and clawing rug with scratching post in the room. Covered post with catnip. Not working so I bought a bottle of KEEP AWAY. Have used half the bottle with no desired results.
4,Keep Away,"This product works fairly well, but it does have to be applied every day (at least at first) to be effective. Of course there are areas that a kitten is going to try to go no matter what type of deterrent is used, so other precautions should still be taken (i.e. moving poisonous plants or dangerous items out of reach)"
3,Somewhat Simplistic,"No school situation will ever be as easy and neat as the story presented in this somewhat annoying book. I didn't care for the style, although ultimately that didn't get in the way of my taking away a few kernels of goodness from this book. The authors present four ""frames"" and urge teachers, in particular, to notice what frame they most naturally align with. At the same time, they point out how the political and the personal are an overlay on so many parts of school life. Stepping back and defining what is going on can never really hurt. The main teacher in this fable is a likeable sort...and it was with amazement that at the end of the book I was wiping away tears.....so I guess if the premise was a bit hokey it didn't matter a whole lot, because they sure got me involved. I would have prefered a little less manipulation of the reader, but all in all, it was worth the two hours it took to read."
4,spell binding,"This book held my interest from start to finish. Once I started it I could not put it down. I had to get to the next chapter to find out what would happen to Alex next, or what will Alex do to his foster parents next!! How will the next event be handled. What other abuse could this poor boy be subject to. This book is extremely graffic, the details of his abuse are given in detail. He suffered physical, sexual, emotional and even ritual abuse. I believe Alex, I believe his foster parents. Some of you may not. Whether you believe the story or not, you'll gain a great perspective about MPD, and you won't be able to put the book down! This book is about a boy's abusive family, most are about girls. I applaud Alex for his courage to heal and to tell his story."
1,Is it true,"I wonder how much is true and how much is made up? If you read about the author her husband was unemployed, she states she got 35,000 a yr to take this child into her home which also stated was more than her teaching salary. Then she writes this book, how much did she make on the book? Do not believe everything you read!"
3,Questions about the author and family,"I'm facinated by the fact that Carole Smith took on this child when nobody else would. I believe in loving everyone unconditionally, but why would it surprise her that something was wrong with him after he'd been refused by everyone else? I'm also very curious about the author. Does she have any other family (children, grandchildren or otherwise)? If so, what kind of relationship does she have with them? Are they teenagers or adults, how have they been raised, and if they're adults, what kind of professions are they involved in? I know this sounds strangely personal, but I just think that further knowledge about the author's life and family would give more insight into the book, how Alex was raised, and what kind of influences he grew up with."
1,I'd give it 0 stars if I had the option,I don't own the game but have played the demo and it is no better than last year's offering. They've had the field all to themselves for the last two years and it is still only 1/10th the game that Papyrus put out 2 years ago. What a joke!!! I wouldn't buy this on a dare.
1,DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!!!!!!,"Great graphics, good car setup tools, tracks look better than ever, completely totally unplayable unless all you want to do is practice and qualify. The game engine does not work at all. I wish I had read reviews on the car sim boards before wasting 10 bucks on this piece of trash. Even before you can start a race you will get a penalty for not being in the correct starting position even though you are right in the right place and then you will be disqualified before you can get to the pits to serve your penalty. Same thing every track every time."
1,You'll be sorry,Uninstalled this peice of garbage today. This game definately does not live up to the hype. Is it better than Thunder 04? maybe. Is it a realistic Nascar sim? NO. If your looking for a Sim Nascar Game buy anything made by Papyrus Racing Games. From Nascar 4 to Nascar 2003. They are not perfect but they are way closer than this. I really had my hopes up that EA would get it right this time but once again they fell way short. EA has exclusive rights to Nascar Sims now and since there is no competition they don't have to worry about making anything better. I've been racing online for 4 years and playing racing games for several years before that. If your looking for a new racing game even if it's not a Nascar game for the PC look elsewhere GTR and R Factor come to mind as games that show way more promise than this one.
1,We need Papyrus Back - EA Missed the Boat,"Ridiculously buggy even after the patch. If there is a yellow flag, chances are you will be blackflagged and taken out of the race. Trying to bring in the elements of sponsorship and working your way through the different divisions was a great concept, too bad what should be the easiest part to program (the NASCAR rules themselves) turn this game into an unplayable mess.I guess we're left with an aging Papyrus Nascar Racing 2003 as the only decent NASCAR sim."
1,CRAP,"I bought this game a year ago, and still haven't got it to work! EA has stopped supporting this game long ago. This game is total crap anyway. The ONLY real NASCAR Sim is NASCAR Racing 2003 Season by Papyrus. That game is continuously updated and supported by the largest single game following that I have ever seen. There are addons available for free through third party websites including Grand National, Craftsman Truck, ARCA Re/Max, and IROC. Those websites also keep all the paint schemes current, and are easily found through a Google or Yahoo search. Use what the real NASCAR drivers race online with, there are tons of open leagues available. [...] Do not buy NASCAR Sim Racing, or you will be dissapointed."
1,This game sucks. Big surprise.,"EA has failed once again.If you are looking for a realistic Nascar sim, then do not buy this game, or any other Nascar game from EA Sports for that matter.The graphics on this game are great, but the whole thing is just so unrealistic.I really thought it would be different this time but as always EA does not live up to my expectations. If you want a true Nascar sim any of the Nascar games from Papyrus is your best bet, i highly recommend Nascar racing 2003 season, 2002 season, or nascar racing 4 all Papyrus games."
3,Only Works On Windows XP,a little disappointed that the game only works on XP....that wasn't in the description....I can only use it on one computer
1,Worst Nascar Game Ever,"This is the worst Nascar Game Ever.There are a lot of Nascar and Racing games out there, this one is just all bad.Fake as all get out.It's about as much fun as sorting socks."
3,Same as NASCAR Thunder 2004,"Well, it's just about exactly the same as NASCAR Thunder 2004, so my review is short. It's acceptable to me, but I never have had any of the older Papyrus versions. EA Games does not make a simulator, it has never produced a simulator. It makes Arcade games. This one gives you a taste of NASCAR and for me it's just fine, but it gets old fairly fast driving on a silly circle track..I would love to try the Papyrus NASCAR 2003, but I'm not about to spend $50-$100 bucks for an old game. I'm just not a sim kind of guy. This one works fine for us poor folk that just use a game pad. Actually the controls are better than in NASCAR Thunder 2004. The sounds are not as good, but I think between the two, I will keep this one and get rid of NASCAR Thunder 2004."
1,WHAT A WASTE!,"THE GAME WAS VERY SLOW TO NAVIGATE BETWEEN SET UP SCREENS AND EVENTUALLY I JUST SAID,WHY BOTHER? EA SPORTS DIDNT GET IT RIGHT WITH THIS ONE."
2,Stick to the Papyrus racing sims for realism,"Graphics are ok. The sound is about 5 years behind in the times. The game play is not challenging at all. An arcade-like physics engine. A child could drive. Absolutely NO realism compared to Papyrus Nascar Racing 2003 season, which was simply the BEST Nascar racing sim out there for graphics, sounds and realism, period! If you can find it, buy it, and forget this one. This game by EA is not for the serious racing enthusiast. What's more sad is that now EA is the only game in town. Their Madden stuff is great, but this game..... forget it."
3,STILL NEEDS WORK,"My name is BOSSDEI, President of DEI THUNDER ONLINE RACING. After 3 months of running a dedicated server for this game, it has issue's that need to be addressed. Our 100+ members are looking for an alternative game until they get it right. Not a future release of the game to fix it."
5,EA Sports Rock!!!,"For those of you who are having issues, RTFM!!! I am running a 3GHz, 2 GB PC3200 Ram, 6800 GT 256mb AGP, and I don't have any problems with the game. If you are having issues with the graphics, either upgrade your video card or make sure you have the latest drivers. You could also add some more RAM. Either way, the manufacture recommends minimum system requirements for a reason.This game provides a great gaming experience for those who are able to comprehend and apply the technical aspects of system maintenance."
1,Very Sad!,"Right now, you can buy EA sports Nascar Thunder 2004, new ,for under 10 dollars on this web site.Nascar 2003, by papyrus, has 4 used copies for 60 dollars.And it's 2 years old. You do the Math!After seeing the Demo I can only imagine what kind of a let down this game is going to be.Hold on to your copy of 2003 real tight!Sierra, please come back!"
2,Buy Paprus instead.,"I gave this game a shot, and after a few months I've decided that you are much better off going with the older Nascar Season 2003. It just feels more authentic. Graphics are fine on NSR. The tracks are beautiful, but the cars look pretty chunky. Physics-wise the cars handle well but it is really hard to get any of the cars loose. I didn't try any of the online racing. I personally do not like EA. They come off as arrogant. They buy all of the rights for Nasacar and put out a mediocre product. Sure, each year there are improvements, but even five years from now I can't see them coming close to the quality of the original Paprus product. Just my two cents (actually $39.99)."
1,Old Game for Old PC's,"This game will NOT work on Vista, no matter what you do. It just wont read. I am a computer programmer, so I am very familiar with getting older games to play on Vista but this one just wouldnt do it.I gave such a poor rating anyways, because the production companies website said this product was compatible with Vista, but once I purchased and called to see if there was something I wasnt doing right, they let me know their information was wrong and that it wasnt Vista compatible.Boo... F Grade. 1 Star (For the Name?). 1/10 Rating.Boo..."
1,Thumbs down!,After reading all the negative reviews and wanting to place one(negative) myself I can only think of one thing. I hope EA is reading the feedback. But all EA cares about is sales. EA will make thier game fixes for the fingertip gamers but for all the racing puriests out there search for plan B. Its a shame a good thing like Papyrus was ruined for EA SPORTS strive for the all mighty dollar.
2,broken out of the box,"As far as Ea's Sim racing goes the graphics are great and the car physics are good.However the game fails to meet its name as a Nascar Sim since the only way to play online is without flags since the flag code of the program is broken and obviously broken out of the box.EA's half hearted attempt at fixing this problem in its patch was at best laughable.EA needs to step-up and find a fix for the flag issues asap,and also needs to address the ranking system that they advertise the game has which is also broken.As far as I am concerned just calling this game a Sim is false advertising since it can't come close to simulating a Nascar race in multiplayer mode."
1,What a piece of garbage.,"EA has proven they are BAD for gamers. Their exclusive licensing has done nothing but harm gaming for all gamers. This product is a prime example, its outrageously poor.The graphics look like something from 10 years ago. How can you release a game with graphics that look like a 2 year old drew them? I recommend going to an importer and ordering the new GTR FIA GT instead, its heaven sent compared to this EA garbage.Keep it up EA, keep releasing the garbage games.. Best anyone can do is to just globally boycott EA games."
5,EA's Got it together,"I was looking forward to getting Simracing for the PC. I got everything I expected- a superb simulation. This is a simulation of the real thing. If you are thinking that the guys at EA are dum, than you're saying Ryan Newman is also dum. Ryan Newman contributed precious information to the designers that makes this a great game.How can you be disqualified when the yellow comes out? The only way to be disqualified is to not obey a black flag, or make a complete stop.If you think this is not a simulation, think again. If you think you will finish in the top 5 in every race, you are wrong. Many people don't think the game is fun because of the difficulty. Those same people just don't understand the rules in the real sport. This game is a simulation of the sport, and that's what a true simulation is. If you decided to not buy this, think again. If you are a true NASCAR fan looking for the most realistic simulation for NASCAR to date, I recommend this game for you."
1,Horrible,"If your looking for a realistic racing sim, don't buy this one. Even after the patch the computer cars often crash you and themselves durring yellow pace laps. The spotter gives misleading information about cars around you. This is an arcade style game in my opinion and not for the serious sim racer."
1,Feature don't actually tally,"product features are not in the pack. there is no car adaptor, neoprene case or earplugs. just a very lousy plastic cover. I have returned my purchase and claimed full refund. DONT buy this based on feature list."
1,"An unfortunate, uncritical restatement of old ideas","What might have been a helpful critique of limitations in current literary criticism is fatally flawed by a basic unfamiliarity with philosophy and literary theory. It's a rambling collection of familiar complaints, ending with an implicit suggestion that everything was better 40 years ago and we should just all come to our senses. A very sad documentation of the poverty of ideas in the moribund culture wars."
1,Wrong item shipped,"I ordered a women's stretch overshoe in a medium (size 6.5-8) but was sent a men's medium. The bar code sticker that was put on the box was incorrect, which I'm sure is why this mistake happened. However, because of this, I was afraid to try to order a different pair. Amazon sent me a pre-paid return label to that I could easily return the product."
1,Women's Rain Overshoes,"This product would be OK for someone who wears a narrow size shoe. The boot would not fit over my shoes that are of average width. I returned the product to Aubuchon and 2 weeks after they received it, I still did not have my account credited. I had to call them to get a refund!"
4,"excellent performance, fragile design","I bought this card for use on the boat at Shilshole Marina in Seattle, to connect to the access points of Broadband Xpress (www.bbxpress.net). After some research, I found that this card (among others) is built on the same chipset as the one bbx sells for $109, and I suspect it actually is exactly the same.It works great on my IBM Thinkpad T20, with Win XP Pro SP2. I installed the drivers from the SMC website. No problem. The custom utility that comes with the drivers is pretty nice, with signal strength, quality, all the available APs, etc. I always use that instead of the Windows one.The only drawback is the weakness of the detachable tab antenna. If you plug it in and out a lot, and travel around with your laptop, it WILL break. Mine did. SMC sent me a new one right away for $20. For that money I could have bought an external one, which I'll get anyway at some point."
1,NEVER RECEIVED OR REFUNDED,NEVER RECEIVED THE PRODUCT I ORDERED AND AMAZON WON'T REFUND....WILL NEVER ORDER FROM AMAZON AGAIN!
4,I Am So Happy I Bought This Book!,"If you suffer from back pain or just want a better posture, this book is terrific. It has helped me more than my physical therapist and personal trainer did. I highly recommend it."
4,"Works fine, over-packaged","Note: I have not tried this on a Windows PC, but on my Linux systems it works fine. This means I have not tried the drivers so I have no idea if it's compatible with Windows or not.It worked perfectly for me. Plug it in, it works. I like the small size (smaller than the other options) and it has good indicator lights.I gave it four stars, instead of five, because it's ridiculously over-packaged. It's just a plug. It does not need to come in a large plastic protector, inside a cardboard box, with printed instructions and a CD. It also comes with a USB extension cable; whether that counts as ""helpful"" or ""over-packaging"" depends on your views.How hard could it be to produce items like this in a reasonable amount of packaging, without the waste of including a CD and documentation? Note, ""documentation"" is ridiculous for an item with no settings, no controls, no configuration, and only two very self-explanatory ports on it (an Ethernet port and a USB port)."
1,spit and chewing gum,"works till it falls apart which is in a short time.you dont buy things anymore,you can only rent them.you vote for this globalist crapp,i dont.thanks.things that use to be made in america are the only things that have ever lasted.walmart[china mart]mentality is killing us.thanks again."
3,Almost happy 2,"I agree with other reviewer, shoes run about a 1/2 size small. I was disappointed because the shoes were so darn cute :-("
2,Castles and Chateaux,Disk only played part of the time then it got stuck and wouldn't move. Will be returning it for another one if possible
5,"Ultra Force Thermals, Bottoms","These Ultra Force thermal bottoms are very comfy and cozy,thick enough for the twenties type weather, the waist band on these thermals are very unusual and surprisenly good they don't bunch or roll and product seems like it would hold up to long wear seems well made and as usual Amazon offers a very decent low price for there products they offer you simply can not go wrong with this product or many other products they sell"
2,Not made in the U.S.A.,"This product states it was made in the U.S.A. When I recieved it and opened the package, the tag said MADE IN KOREA. I ordered this product ONLY because it said it was made in the USA. I could have saved on shipping and handling by going to a local store and buying something made overseas. The additonal information needs to be changed on the website to state this is not an American Made product."
2,not complete,I ordeded 4 PAIRS of thermals on december 14 as a gift for christmas and on top of the fact that I did not recieve them till 2 weeks later the order was incomplete and I only recieved the bottoms and not the tops AND I WAS CHARGED FOR THE FULL ORDER. Needless to say that I was very dissapointed I was very dissapointed
3,"One of her ""experimental"" books","Although I usually LOVE this author, I thought that this book was sort of weak. The plot could be confusing, and required me to go back and read previous bits all the time. In addition, I found the characters to be a little strange. The sisters act like nasty old adults at the beginning, and I was pretty far into the book before I realized that they were supposed to be kids. By the time I figured it out, I had to go back and re-read the whole thing in order to understand what was going on. Then, suddenly, they WERE adults. The sudden appearance of the occult stuff was a little jarring, too.If you want a challenging book and like stories that mess with the space-time continuum, then maybe this book is worth a read. Unlike her Chrestomanci series, this is NOT a kids book. It contains domestic violence and occult practices, as well as a few other things that might be questionable. However, they are appropriately done, so the book is fine for YA."
2,"Love DWJ, But this is far from her best","The four sisters, Imogen, Sally, Cart and Fenella, are all unpleasant and unlikeable. They are immature and uncared for in much of the novel, and perhaps that is the reason for their often bizarre behavior. Their parents, in their callous behaviour to their own offspring, are also very unlikeable.Unfortunately, it takes at least half of the novel to make sense of what is happening in the plot. By that time, I was out of patience with it, although I did finish the book.Diana Wynne Jones has written many better books. Try Archer's Goon, The Dark Lord of Derkholm, The Year of the Griffin, Howl's Moving Castle, Power of Three, the Merlin Conspiracy or Deep Secret. Give this one a miss."
2,Meandering Plot... *Yawn*,"I thought the idea of this story was truly original. I did not, however, enjoy the writing skills of Diana Wynne Jones or the slowness of the storyline at times. Diana is able to portray characters very well with description, but she doesn't make the characters feel like ""real"" people. Also, her writing style is very confusing at times. At some points in the story you don't know who the person narrating is. It switches off from person to person without really notifying you. Overall, I found the book to have an original concept but a dragging and complicated storyline."
3,Complex yet confusing,"I love DWJ book,s but I find this one somewhat disappointing. It is more sinister than her others and lacks their light charm. The plot is extremely complex and the first time I read the book I did not understand what happened at all. After a second read it becomes somewhat clearer, but it still remains rather foggy and hazy. And the characters are simply bizarre."
1,"Concentrates on book layout, not the subject at hand...","I agree with the previous review, this book is a GROSS disappointment. It's a large and impressive looking volume at first, but the facts contained within are very poorly researched and there are countless errors regarding the photos and the liners in general.My bigger problem, however, is that this book should perhaps be better titled ""Life on Board the French Line"" or ""Life on the Ile de France"" because honestly, 80% of the photos relate to the Ile or to the French Line. Even photos of the memorabilia almost all show CGT items, with a noteworthy amount of attention paid to the P&O; Line for some reason.If you're looking for photos or information on any Cunard, White Star Line, North German Lloyd, HAPAG, or U.S. Lines ship, forget it, there's nothing here for you. And that's not an exaggeration."
5,Great industrial glue gun with two tips,"If you want an industrial quality gun look no further. This is our second. Switching glues is a pain and wastes a whole stick, so get a gun for each glue type you plan to use."
1,I'd give it a lower rating........ but I love the Damned!,"I agree with the other reviews in that this had so much potental... and it was squandered by letting outside influences deside what the fans want (or need). Speaking for all Damned fans out there, it is simple..... WE JUST WANT TO SEE THE ... SHOW!! No narrative was needed (especially from the [person] they used). Noticed that he remained anonymous and not listed on the credits to avoid being hunted down by the fans. My recommendation is that you buy the audio CD of this performance and forget this ..."
3,Who the hell destroyed a damned great VHS for this DVD.,"This concert originally came out on VHS years ago and was GREAT. Great quality, great performances, great recording. Highly, Highly recommended. In fact, I was wearing it out, which is where this DVD came in. What a disappointment. A commentator was added, which was not on the VHS, blocking the beginning of songs and cutting right into and over the middle of them. If you can get the VHS, do so and put it on DVD. If you can't, get this."
3,Not the one,"I do like the Whole Earth CAtalog and spent hours going through it when it first came out. I bought this one, thinking it was the one with ""Stay Hungry, stay foolish"" on the back, but it's not. Still searching."
1,FALSE INFORMATION,"DO NOT ORDER THIS!!! WHAT YOU WILL GET IS A CLEAR BOTTLE, WITH NO WOMAN ON THE BOTTLE, AND THE PERFUME IS PINK IN COLOR.IT IS NOT AT ALL WHAT YOU SEE ON THIS PAGE!!!FALSE ADVERTISING!!"
1,Not full or used,"Although I love the way this product smells on my wife, it is no longer available in stores; therefore, I have to find it on-line. However, when my wife opened the box as part of her birthday gifts, there was almost an ounce out of the bottle. It appeared to be packaged like that and not leaked because there was no discoloration of the box it was packaged in. Although I would recommend the fragrance, I would recommend buying it elsewhere."
2,Disappointed,"I have bought Hot Couture at a department storea couple times and loved it. I haven't been able to find it lately, so tried on line. I was excited to find it, however when I received it, it smelled kind of funky- maybe old or something.Very disappointing!"
3,Something funny...,"Ordered this as a gift when my girlfriend was running low. Strangely enough, something is off. She smells it doesn't quite smell like the other one does. I am not sure if it is old or what. I was troubled by some of the reviews on here, but I have to side with them. The coloring is off (compared to her other bottle) and so is the fragrance. Not that it smells bad, though. So buyer beware - just be ready to return if you think it might not be totally authentic."
3,Two ideas new to me,"I enjoyed Stegemann's book very much. In spite of the fact that he presented a great deal of material,I never felt bogged down in unnecessary detail.Two ideas in his book were new to me. First, that the Teacher of Righteousness died of old age, when everything else that I have read has him being slain. Second, that the basis of normative Rabbinic Judaism has its roots in Essene theology. Again this goes against everything else that I have ever read, which has normative Rabbinic Judaism coming out of Pharasaic Judaism."
1,Cheap Product Poor Quality,"I purchased this item as a cheap solution to connect my mp3 player to my car's stereo through it's cassette player. I figured that I would give this solution a try using this very low cost item. In theory, it worked. The mp3 player could play its music through the adapter. However, this adapter made for horrible sound quality (e.g. garbled sound) and its cheap construction is evident just by looking at it. It's not even worth the $2 (pluse S&H) that I paid for it. At least it proved the theory. It's in my garbage can and I'm now ordering an adapter from a better brand of electronics. Hopefully, the next one will work out better!"
3,Cassette Adapter,"The convenience I really like, very useful, but the soundthat quality is not that great; kind of muffled with lots of background noise"
3,"HOW ABOUT THE "" LETS GET LOST ALBUM"" THINK BACK...","I HAVE BEEN LOOKING FOR THE "" LETS GET LOST "" ALBUM FOR THE LONGEST TIME BUT FOR SOME REASON,IT DOES NOT EXIST. EVEN THOUGH I HAVE A VERY USED COPY. CAN YOU TELL ME WHY ? THANKS"
1,"Where's ""I Can See Clearly Now""?","What? A Johnny Nash greatest hits album without his biggest hit, ""I Can See Clearly Now""? Odd..."
4,Great for price!,"Not the thickest pages, but i've found after having both thick expensive pages and thinner ones like this - that honestly it doesn't matter for me. I like the coloring and it's a great connection between price and value."
2,Not really legal ruled,"Although technically legal pads, these pads are not legal ruled. I wanted the smaller ruled pages of a true legal pad. The quality of the paper is also rather flimsy. It's a good price but I won't be ordering this again."
5,Standard Legal Pad,These are nice standard legal pads. I use them everyday for work and they help me stay organized. No issues.
5,Tops Letr-Trim Perforated Top Letter Size Canary 50 Sheet Legal Pad 1...,Tops Letr-Trim Perforated Top Letter Size Canary 50 Sheet Legal Pad arrived a few days after I placed the order.
4,A nice collection,"This collection of papers concerning behavioural finance, is a very helpfull item for any PhD or reasearch student that works on this subject. Although it does not contain material of the basics of behavioural finance, it has some good papers on issues such as volatility of the markets, noice trading etc."
1,Battery Tester,This Battery Tester does not work very well. Weak batteries test good in this tester. I bought 2 testers and they both work the same. The same batteries were tested in 3 other testers that said they were weak or bad.The Bulb and fuse tester functions are ok.
3,Gave as a gift,I gave this as a gift. I'm not sure if it's been tried out yet. It seems like a great little gadget.
3,Absolutely a must-read!,"The authors father, Brookes Bargainier, lives two doors down from me. I was having coffee with him one morning when he bragged to me, ""This is the book my son wrote"". I borrowed it from him and read it in four hours. While I didn't find it particularly well written, and even less well edited, the story it told swept my mind up into a maelstrom and flung it far and wide. The events portrayed, while horrible enough as fiction, are made even moreso with the knowledge that they're based on fact. It is indeed a sad commentary on the state of affairs in America today, and the road down which we are headed."
5,Elis more incredible than ever!,"Back in the 70's, Elis Regina was an icon in Brazil. If you're skeptical, check this album out and you'll understand why. When she passed away in 1982, there was a large media coverage and population involvement (think Tom Jobim or Ayrton Senna). Elis is a charismatic and dynamic singer who had the ability to transcend the songs she covered. As Curvas da Estrada de Santos by Roberto Carlos is one example of out many. Elis is a truely a hurricane, check her out!"
5,lovely little angels,Love this little book. Already planning my little angels. Great drawings and shown in several sizes. Will be easy to use.
3,Disappointing,"This was a negative departure of sorts for BOA,though it did have some good play.It had 2 things on it I really don't care for at all,synthesizers and a Paul McCartney song.The late Ruby Starr sang ""maybe I'm amazed"".Had she sang Joplin's "" Peice of my heart"",it could have changed the whole album tone.It seemed a departure for the band toward what ""everybody else"" was doing and it just didn't work.Some of the song intros I thought they were gonna break into ""Phylidephia Freedom""or 'Disco Inferno"".If your a long time fan buy it,if not Raunch&Roll; or MUTHA LIVE are best."
5,Great Shoes at a Great Price,I bought these shoes about last year for $29+ and this month I purchased 3 pairs of my size at $9.99 each. WOW What a Steal!!!!!
5,Pure Joy!! i was listening to,"a Son Volt cd & i heard 'Mystifies Me' and i got goose bumps, i hadn't heard the song in nearly 25 years and it all came rushing back. the songs and singing are great and there's folks on this album that ain't listed in the credits, that's cool if you're an audiophile.Get It!!!!!!"
2,Woody is a side man,"Projects like this serve an artist well. It can be quite humbling, in as much as to show themselves and the rest of the world what their contribution is in the grand scheme of things. Without a means to vent our own art, tensions will arise, and become destructive in the more successful,high pressure projects that have afforded them to explore their own creativity. that being said, take this for what it is."
3,In the shadow of a legend,"Always a very competent guitarist, (he seemed confused and annoyed at the Super Bowl, though) he remains an impostor. In attempting to fill the shoes of Brian Jones, he failed miserably where Mick Taylor at times was able to succeed. No great Stones albums since Sticky Fingers...a sad fact that is an indictment on RW as well as on the shadow of a band that remains."
2,A General Overview of Exchange 5,"The Exchange 5 Source Book written by Mann, Bracka, et al is very difficult to follow. It seems like it was written very fast by many people and pulled together at the last minute. There are many disjointed segments that are often repeated in other portions of the book. There are references throughout the book to other sections that in some cases do not even exist. Overall the book is a general overview of Exchange Server and Exchange/Outlook clients. I used the book as a background to the Microsoft course work and did find it to supplement the material somewhat. One notable well-written section is on designing and installing an Exchange system. In addition, some of the material on Internet connections was good. I would recommend waiting for some of the other Exchange 5.0 books that are scheduled for publication in the next few months"
4,Great book on organizing yourself,"I bought this book thinking it would be just another book on cleaning out your mess type of talk. I've been there and done that, but seeing some of the content first I realized there was more to it. I have gotten several tips from the book that will help me a lot. For example, having a file for a staff meeting to collect ideas of things to talk about for an agenda. The only problem is that the book is very centered around filing and paper, and not enough on the electronic systems. Everything mentioned with regards to paper files can be used on a computer as well, but I think this book needs yet another update to get into more details. Overall, I really liked this book, must be a compulsion for organization on my part!"
2,"A Classic Text, Superficially Updated","The cover claims that the book has been ""revised and updated for the digital age,"" but Winston's information on technological tools is both superficial and already dated. The term, ""PDA,"" does not even appear in the index."
1,Disappointing....,"This book has no great insights, and spends to much time telling you what a disk drive is, rather than discussing a system to help you manage a flow of information and materials. It should have been a paragraph, rather than a book. Keep a to do list, figure out a filing system, delegate what you can, make a decision on what you cannot delegate, do not just pile it up. Thats about it, I expected more."
3,Useful Ideas.,"I read this book back in the nineties. The tips and ideas I acquired in this book those early days provided an important platform for me to stand on. Whether you are totally unorganized or not, you are bound to find this book useful. This book will encourage you to be more disciplined with organizing the affairs in your life. God knows in this day of information overload you need all the tips, advice and revelations you can find on organization. This book will meet the objective of boosting productivity at some level in one's daily life."
2,This was great...in 1985.,"I listened to the abridged audiobook, and I can tell you that there were very few nuggets that were useful for the 21st Century executive. From how to organize your paper filing system to how best to use your secretary to manage your day and phone call volumes (including using the pay phone in the lobby to keep call durations to a minimum), the tape is so dated as to be near valueless for the modern listener.Some of the elements of prioritization - both personal and staff - are still relevant, but for the most part, the tape is old, the info is very very dated, and areas like email aren't even touched on. Listen elsewhere..."
5,GREAT IDEA FOR KIDS,"I love this product. I bought a case of these and the kids love picking out a plate each evening for their dinner. They love to put sauce or fruit in the ears, and at breakfast it is where we put syrup for dipping waffles and pancakes. They throw them away when they are done and clean-up is a breeze! I cannot say enough about how much I like this product!"
5,"Miller is a masterful poet in his own right, his reflections reflect that","Wonderful insight on poetic process and persona, lucid observations on some of the most important poets from many varied centuries and schools."
3,Making A Poem,"While I highly respect the reputation and work of Miller Williams, I did not find this book stirring,inspirational, or helpful to the writing of poetry. I purchased it after reading the new ""Preface"" --(written by Billy Collins)-- in the reissue of 'The Apple That Astonished Paris"". Interesting but not a keeper."
3,had some good advice,"While i didn't find it a cure-all, and according to the book you end up taking a lot of supplements, too much for me, I still got some good advice out of this book. It gives a lot of supplement advice to take, and some of it I tried, like taking L-Glutamine for sugar cravings, and it worked... and food advice, like eat your fruit with some kind of protein to help stop cravings, and that worked too.The book is divided into different sections for different problems you may have, like thyroid, or weightloss or whatever and gives you corresponding advice for each problem. I found, though, that that made some of the advice a little hard to find because I still found good advice in each section even if it didn't pertain to me... so if you are interested in a specific supplement for example, go into the index and look it up in all the chapters, and you will learn more than what was just in the chapters that pertained to you."
4,The non-diet diet book,"There's a wealth of nutrition information, recommended supplements and how-tos. I'mdefinitely going to try this non-diet diet book! I'm also buying two more copies for friends who are interested.If you're not into taking pills you can skip this book!"
4,Diet Cure,"It's okay, but a bit hard to stay focused on. Some helpful info, but if you're not into supplements and eating specific healthy diet all the time, may not be for you. Everything seems to be poisining our bodies and getting our hormones out of balance and if you can't afford to eat organic, free range or grass fed products, you're out of luck. It is good though to help get off the roller coaster dieting."
4,My sugar cravings stopped immediately.,"In spite of her (I believe) uninformed prejudice against vegetarian diets, this book has a lot of useful information. Every doctor I've seen over the past 12 years I have been a vegetarian (and there have been very few) has accused me of having low iron, but my blood-work always checks out like a teenager's! Also, I breezed through menopause with nary a hot flash or mood swing. However, my vegetarian diet did not protect me from years of dieting before I became a vegetarian, and my uncontrollable carbohydrate (particularly sugar) cravings. This book helped me within 24 hours like it said. The author is a product of her own experiences, and I don't think we need protein in meat or animal products -- not ever. I've gotten the protein she recommends from beans, tofu, etc. I feel great, so I have adopted much of what she recommends. But no one has perfect information, so I recommend Fit for Life by Harvey and Marilyn Diamond as supplemental information."
2,Cure what?,"Decent book, but the idea of taking all of these amino acids throughout the day isn't realistic at all. She does thoroughly explore the possibility of food allergies for many people. She really gives a tepid endorsement of the Atkins/Eades High Protein diet, albeit with more vegetables. But I bought, like the idiot I am, every amino she recommended and did not get the benefits she said I'd get. Save the money. Give up milk, nutrasweet, and sugar, and go from there."
5,It's all true. Worth the money.,"I've tried almost every diet, and had given up. This made so much sense, that I was willing to try another plan. So far I've lost 20 pounds fairly painlessly. The book gives a lot of information. She tells you how the body works and why things happen the way they do. I am amazed at how well it works. I took the amino acid supplements that she reccommended and my cravings were gone. Read this book. Excellent results."
4,Stop the food cravings,"This book, and the Mood Cure, by the same author, really helped me. The other book helped with mood swings, and other menopause stuff, this one helped me to be able to stop almost all of my food cravings. I can actually eat a bite or two of chocolate and STOP. Something I was rarely able to do before I started following the recommended regimine in this book.Until I started doing what is recommended in this book, I didn't buy or make sweet things very often. Because if they were in the house, I'd keep going back to them until they were gone. Once I started taking the amino acids I was evidently deficient in, I was able to eat a bit and leave it alone, like a regular person. LOL I can buy a pack of cookies, eat 2 or 3, and leave the rest for the next day. Amazing.This worked for me."
2,Confused,"I was very committed to this program and gave it two months worth of (what I now consider) money which is the only thing I lost. The book is confusing, lots of crossover but no clearcut instruction. Are all of these supplements really good for your body? I wonder."
4,"HIghly recommended, still need to read it though!","This book was recommended to me by the institute where I have studied at....the C.H.E.K. Institute. I recently received this book, but havent had a chance to begin reading it. I know it will be good since I was informed about the clear, balanced, and practical material it contains."
1,Almost Atkins,"This book is basically a rework of the Atkins diet with a few added features I find dangerous. The author suggests taking all kinds of supplements and though available at a local health food store, we need to be careful with how many supplements we take. The author suggests that we consult our Doctor, many people will not and just self-medicate themselves. I believe the author's intention is to benefit others with this information, I just wish she put out a stricker warning or more information on supplements."
5,Best book,"I battle acne and horrible mood swing all of my teenage life and into my early 20's. It wasn't until I came across this book that changed my life. This book talks about information about diet years before the ""media"" got a hold of it. I highly recommend this book it changed my life for the better and I'm now acne and mood swing free. What great about this book it helps guide you through the process of getting you out of eating the unhealthy food and gets you into healthy food with no pain. It tells you what supplements you can take to help with the cravings."
5,Maks Sense of it All,"Written for the lay person, but loaded with the scientific basis of nutrition and what the foods we eat do once inside our bodies. I'm following the advice given in the book and it has been spot on. I recognized a lot from college chemistry and biology, but this was far, far easier to understand and apply. I now look at food in a whole new light and feel better than I have in years. My only criticism would be that she continually refers you to other chapters, which made sense within the context of whatever subject she was on, but you had to keep going to the table of contents. It would have been helpful to have the chapter number included on the top of the right hand page so you could leaf through to the referred chapter quickly, but all in all a small inconvenience in an otherwise great experience. This book is a keeper for future reference, and I have already recommended it to some friends."
4,This book is a huge help to dieters!,"This book helped me to find a doctor who would help me and I feel better already. I am free from my torturous cravings for sugar. I have probably needed medical attention for years but just thought I needed to try harder. So much of what is in this book, you can do on your own. Her listings in the back for resources helped me find a holistic D.O. who knew immediately what I needed. Thank you Ms. Ross!"
4,"I'm excited to get started, but....","the book is confusing. I tested out having seven of the eight problems listed. One of my problems having to do with the thyroid, I have a lump in my throat and have trouble swallowing pills. With all of the supplements that I will need to take, combined with this problem I'm not sure how I'm going to do it. I wish there was a list for people with my exact profile of what to take and when, instead of trying to combine all of those lists! There has to be an easier way to make the book less confusing."
3,"De,tea and me","Selective Memory debunks Shoba De's glittering image as a socialite and shows the earthy side of her.Chapters spotlighting her foray into modelling,celebrity journalism laced with some interesting name dropping is bound to be amusing for a culturally akin person.She shows a happy blend of contradictions:liberal yet traditional and arrogant yet simple.Her guilts,personal upheavals and psychological insights make her come across as a very strong woman trying to juggle family and professional life.A nice light read the kind you'll enjoy over a cup of tea. I can't see its appeal for an international audience that does not share a cultural affinity to De."
2,mediocre writing at best,Shobha De the well known gossip writer from India is at it again writing a mediocre guilt ridden work with very little novelty.This will be of interest to only her ardent fans and people with too much time on their hands
2,Read more like 'film' gossip magazine,"Well, I have read 'Spouce' by Shobha De. That book was pretty decent - and that in a way prompted me to take up reading Shobha De's autobiography.Except for the couple of pages in the beginning, which do describe Shobha'a early life, this book may NOT be termed as an autobiography. This book has pages and pages of what a movie gossip magazine usually has - which movie star has an inflated head, which movie star still has the Bihari attitude.. And movie magz are something I don't enjoy reading too much.I did not pick up this book to know more about movie stars - I picked up this book to know more about Shobha De - the person (who could be a daughter, wife, mother, model, journalist, author).Honestly speaking, I did not enjoy reading this 'autobiography' that was majorly laced with lives of movie stars. I just hope Shobha could have done a far better job on her autobiography than this."
1,Poor Sound Quality,"I dont recommend, the sound quality is too poor. I do not recommend this CD. Wasn't worth the money I paid."
5,Alt 80s at it's best!,"This really is slanted toward what we would have called New Wave...now more commonly referred to as Alternative...The Fixx, Duran Duran, Tears For Fears, Stray Cats, Thompson Twins...all breakout New Wavers in the 80s...then throw in J. Geils, Rick Springfield, and Wang Chung and you've got quite the span of artists.Buy this, you'll love it!Tom HarveyAuthor of ""The Eighties: A Bitchen Time To Be a Teenager!"""
2,Below Average; Typical 80's Music,"After the great music of the 60's and 70's, Rock went into a 10 year slump in the 80's.Most of the Artists that popped up in this decade are long forgotten. THANK GOD! If they piped 80's music into the N.Y. sewer system, all the rats and alligators would move to New Jersey!"
3,Not too exciting,I did not open this CD set because I already have all the music on it. This is good for the person who does not intend to purchase any other music from the 80's. Otherwise there are large collections for better price.
5,PERFECT?,"Out of hundreds and hundreds of albums I can honestly only count about 8 or 10 that are perfect- ie. I like every song on that album. Dark side of the moon, SGT. Pepper, Pretenders 1st album and Pink Floyd: the Wall are a few examples. I sat down on my couch and put this album on my Stereo and I couldn't believe it. I loved every song. It will probably be different for everyone else out there but that's my two cents. Oh by the way, I was so blown away that I bought the red and green ""Cube"" albums since then and they weren't quite as good."
4,Excellent collection for the price!,"For the cost of the CD, this is a very good overview of the technicolor day-glo era.There are of course the usual omissions that happen due to licencing and so on. The Bangles, Madonna, Price, Michael Jackson, Sting, etc. And there are no liner notes, which is disappointing.However, this is an excellent collection of the 80's sound, and the price is right."
2,Better songs were left off.,"This is a decent cd the sound is good, but the selection is not what it could or should be. While it has many of the good songs of the eighties. I would have preferred they leave off ""Video Killed The Radio Star"", ""Everybody Have Fun Tonight"", and ""Tempted"" with ""Eye Of The Tiger"", ""True"", and ""Don't Dream It's Over"". They could have also added ""Don't Stop Believing"" and ""Missing You"". I'm going to keep looking for a better 80's cd."
3,"Good, but not good enough","When I got this CD, I could only recognise four or five songs as good representatives of the decade. Most of the remainder I could locate in my memory, but I wouldn't put them on a definitive compilation. I would go with the Eurythmics, Boy George and Marc Almond as the best picks, Madness not lagging too far behind. However, the compilers could've done better with the other selections."
2,This collection is lacking.,"First of all I would like to say that why does every 80's collection have to have the same exact songs on it or they vary it just a little. Instead of putting the typical songs on these 1980s albums why don't they try putting different songs maybe people don't know. Anyways back to the album, the album features many hit but few that I like , ""Addicted To Love"" ""Higher Love"" and ""Obsession"" are the worthiest songs on this collection. By The Way who are the Stray Cats I have never heard of them and I am a 1980s fanatic."
1,I REGRET EVER RENTING THIS STUPID-A** BULLSH*T,"A COP GOES UNDERCOVER AT A LOCAL HIGH SCHOOL TO INVESTIGATE A MURDER AND TO BRING DOWN A VICIOUS GANG OF DRUG DEALERS. VERY CHEAP AND VERY SENSELESS. FOR A GANGSTA MOVIE, THIS SEEMS TO HAVE QUITE A BIT OF FIGHTS. JAMES CAHILL MUST THINK HE'S BRUCE LEE THE WAY HE BE FIGHTING HIS WAY THROUGH ALL THE GANGS. THIS DEFINITELY IS ONE GANGSTA MOVIE I'M ASHAMED TO SAY I'VE SEEN. FILLED WITH HILLARIOUSLY BAD ACTING AND VERY POINTLESS ACTION SCENES. THIS MOVIE SHOULD'VE NEVER EVER BEEN MADE IN THE FIRST PLACE."
1,"Oh dear, oh dear","I hope for James Cahill's sake the guy on the cover never watches the movie. He doesn't look like the guy you would want to take the piss out of.Like the old saying never read a book by it's cover cause you will be burned, this is especially true in this case.I don't need to break into detail because it's not worth the keystrokes, I for one will be demanding my 5 bucks back."
1,All bad reviews are correct,"This movie is terrible. The main character seems really gay, and since he is playing a straight guy he has no talent whatsoever. The martial arts in this movie are sloppy, weak, and totally unrealistic. They use toy guns. Probably the cheapest, most poorly made movie I've ever seen. They put more effort into the cover than anything else. If you're interested in cheap stupid movies, this one is for you."
5,Revolutionary,"An absolutely amazing film that changed cinema, and not just because it was the first film of the Italian neorealism movement. Visconti's version of The Postman Always Rings Twice is beautiful, desperate, and inspiring."
4,What's Love Got to Do With It?,"Visconti's directoral debut is a cinematic milestone both in noir and neo-realism. A brilliant adaptation of Cain's 'The Postman Always Rings Twice,' depicting the descent of two lonely souls into lust, avarice, and desperation. The use of light and shadow emphasize the character development. The finale is one of the most ironic scenes in film history (unwittingly omitted from the american versions)."
1,Beware ImportCDs.com,The dvd for Ossessione advertised on Amazon.com by ImportCDs.com is the 140 minute Image Entertainment release. The dvd they shipped me was a 112 minute Korean bootleg. It's unfortunate a reputable company like Amazon allows this to happen.
1,Things are not what they seem to be,"Many years ago I saw a movie on TV entitoled ""Obsession"" It made an impression on me. I have since tried to find a copy of it anf thought this was it. It was not! This movie was passe. It was a waste of money."
2,"Great at Stabilizing, but Leaks","Installation of these air springs is a good 2-3 hours depending on your skill level and the type of jack you're using. Installation for my Ford F-150 went pretty smoothly.I have had trouble keeping air in them. I'm having to inflate one side daily. The manual talks about where the leaks may occur, and they're right. I found it impossible to follow the directions literally and not have a significant air leak.The air leaks occur where the air fitting connects to the top of the unit. I tweaked and tweaked, and even put teflon tape on the threads ( which helped a lot), but I'm still having trouble with one of them.I'll looking at an RMA soon if I can't get this resolved. I don't understand how these folks can make this heavy-duy air spring, with steel hardware to fit your vehicle perfectly, then mess it up with a poorly engineered air fitting.- FB"
2,Sport Rite for f-150,"Absolute joke to install on a 1997 f-150. does not set on spring properly, bag is slanted not verticle after install. would not purchase again....."
1,junk,"I bought a set of sport rite air bags on feb 22 2011 for my 06 chevy silverado, the date today is march 21 2012 and one has a hole in it, do to they continuously leak air and then flex like a shock and crack the rubber til it wears a hole it, so be aware they will not back there product. i got these to help with leveling the truck while pulling my camper they were only pumped up to 28# 3times last yr which max is 30#. other than that i maintained 10#. when i contacted the company they said the hole was not under warranty its only manufacture defect. Ah OK I didnt put the hole there."
3,English hero saves decaying Irish princess,"In a strictly academic way, this book is important and useful and should be read as part of the Anglo-Irish literary canon. I did not find it to be a fascinating read however. It is extremely melodramatic with gothic overtones. The plot is fairly predictable and while Owenson is claiming 'positive' and 'cultured' qualities for the denigrated Irish, she ends up romanticizing her characters. Love and marriage are the typical solutions to deepset political differences. If only it worked that way. . ."
5,Jive Bombers,Great CD I didn't know all of their recordings had been placed on a CD. The Jive Bombers are an acquired taste.
5,Dig The Jive,"Clarence Palmer & company sing 13 original Savoy recordings in this wonderful compilation. Pee Wee Tinney handles the lead vocal on 2 tracks (""The Blues Don't Mean A Thing"" & ""When Your Hair Has Turned To Silver"".) The final track is an alternate version of their signature song ""Bad Boy""."
3,good book but a bit slow,"Unlike most others, I found this book a slow read. The middle part of the book dragged and I found myself skimming a lot of the middle. The storyline, while basically plausible, was a little unbelievable - that someone could get away with what they did without anyone figuring it out. The information on conversion disorder was interesting and woven into the storyline well. Character development was spotty. Some characters were developed nicely, while others seemed to have blank faces until almost the end. The packages, which opened the story, never really played out - I was expecting them to reveal something earth shattering, but they didn't. A lot of the ""shockers"" were predictable because of long drawn out leads up to them.All in all, I did enjoy reading the book, but as mentioned, found it a tough slog in some places."
5,a page turning thriller with a blind female protagonist,"Another fabulously entertainment from Gayle Lynds, whose Masquerade was so engaging. Mosaic brings to life a new heroine, who, despite her major handicap of blindness, is anything but helpless. Here is another intricate plot, peopled by unforgettable characters who do their deeds in glamorous and exotic places. Don't pick this book up if you have a deadline, because you won't be able to put it down until you find out what happened to that fabled Czarist treasure, The Amber Room. Lynds writes so vividly that reading her books is like watching a movie in your mind. I can't wait for the film."
5,I spy family lies !!! :O),"At first glance, this sound like an idea done before....""blind woman getting her sight back, just in time to be a witness to a murder""....If you think that's it all there is to it, then you're in for a surprise !!! The high-lights in the story are the chases ( I have never gotten such exercise without moving !), and also the family secrets that you don't know the ending of, until the very ending ! And the sexual tension is also good, spices things up ! But it's Gayle Lynds ability to tell you about the people in strange and unusual situations, which they have to get out of, that got me hooked on from the first word! For anybody that likes a good spy-like story, laced with deceit and other such things that make a great action novel, should check this one out. Mosaic has it all : romance, tragedy, treasure, family dealings and the main thing....political double crossing ! If I have said too much, believe me, this is just the tip of the iceberg !!"
5,Great seller for books,"Very reasonable price, excellent customer service, fast shipping. The book .. well, I don't think I'll use it. I bought a translation book first to see if it made any sense for me to buy an electronic language translator. The dictionary made me realize an electronic translator would be no better than a printed dictionary."
3,fine but overpriced for what it is,"this product hangs okay (although i agree with another reviewer who says there should be something to hold it from the bottom, too). however, it isn't worth the price for the material used and this design"
5,Just what I was looking for!,"Like everyone else, I needed something to put kitchen wrap/storage bags in and it seems like the products made for this are odd-sized and don't really fit the bill. This seems to be just what I was looking for - an open contained hanging space to get all those boxes out of my kitchen drawer. Because I will be mounting this on the wall in my pantry, I don't believe I'll have the problem with the un-anchored bottom like others have had. I've already tested and was able to put a box of aluminum foil, plastic wrap, wax paper and gallon-sized freezer storage bags in one holder. I'm glad I got a 2nd one to hold paper lunch bags and sandwich baggies. I like the included wall-anchors for the screws - nice touch."
1,wrong description of the product-no english subtitles,"These are a very good movies, but the description to this particular product is wrong. If you want to enjoy these movies and don't speak french-don't buy them! Because the movies are in French and yes they are subtitled as described, but subtitled in French!!! I tried to return DVD's back to Amazon, but they say that even though the movie is in French, it is still SUBTITLED so I can understand it and can't return it because of lack in description."
1,Poor product description...,"My star rating is based upon the poor product description that Amazon.com has for this movie. I took a chance an ordered this product, but Vasili Rabshtyna is correct in that there are NO ENGLISH SUBTITLES. I'm not sure where Thierry Rabaud purchased his copy but I suspect it wasn't from Amazon.com, at least not the one here in the USA. It looks like the UK Amazon.com has the PAL region 2 encoding version of this product, which does have English subtitles.So, unless you speak French, DO NOT PURCHACE THIS PRODUCT!"
5,More info please/Plus d'info SVP,"Is these DVDs has English subtitles?My wife is American and doesn't speak Frnach, actually she prefer to read subtitles than listen to a dubbing in French.Thanks for the info.Est ce que ces DVDs ont des soustitres en Anglais?Ma femme est Americaine est ne parle pas Francais, en fait elle prefaire lire des sous titres en Anglais que d'ecouter un doublage en Anglais.Merci pour ces renseignements.Thierry"
5,Giant Squid For the Win!,Bought this squid for my roommate of 8 years for his 27th birthday and he LOVES it. It's been a long standing nickname between us but he's quite impressed with the anatomical accuracy of this squid and the squid has already survived multiple uses as an 'Attack squid' missile ;)
3,I'm on a mission,"This toy does not suck, I wanted the tentacles to suck onto my face, but sadly they do not. i am overall satisfied with this toy even though it doesn't suck. *shh* i've already told you too much we can't talk anymore."
4,Very Cute! A great purchase!,I got this for my girlfriend. She absolutely LOVED it. I would highly recommend this for anyone who likes plush animals or aquatic creatures.
5,Perfect...,"My son is 7, and his favorite animal in the world is the Giant Squid. It's very difficult to find replicas of the giant squid, as they aren't exactly the most popular animal around. But I found this one here at Amazon and was so surprised that ANYONE made a PLUSH giant squid, I had to have him for my son's Easter basket. I got him in just a couple of days, and I can't say enough about it's quality. Very well designed and completely anatomically correct, with feeder arms, beak AND siphon! This was important since it is very important to my Boy to have things as realistic as possible. He LOVES the squid - has named him Ikay (Japanese for squid) and is carrying him everywhere, using him to destroy Lego ships and attack Bionicles. I've never seen him so taken with a stuffed animal before - this is a first.IF you know a child or adult who is fond of the Giant Squid - you will love this creature. He's perfect."
5,Great product!,"I love this brand, and this scent is no different. It's one of my favorites and at a good price."
4,Very lush at a great price,"My mother had bought a 4 inch twin for my grandmother at approx. the same price at one of those super stores, so I was worried about feeling a little ripped off. NOT AT ALL. When they say super soft they mean it, and it made the miserable air matress I was on comfy. I sleep on a quality tempra foam matress the rest of the time and I like this topper so much I might start packing it in my luggage to make hotel beds bearable. Great product for us picky sleeps."
5,"Charming, Funny, and True","Every movie textbook i've read (that's right--both of 'em!) say that for an adaptation to be sucessful, it must have it's own ideas about the matierial. If the original is ""perfect"", the only way to equal it is to be different. All of the above are applicable to this charming masterpiece. It brilliantly shows the tame '98 movie what spirit is. There is charm and wit ('Why do you compare everything to Les Miserables? It's wierd!') and a ridiculous old man ( the adorble Belmondo) who falls head-over-heels in love with the majic of a book. Suddenly, he sees Hugo in everything! A state that would be annoyingly childish if the film weren't so aware of the satiric possibilities. Much as it hurtas to find fault, Javert is rather sketchy and a pale substitute for hugo's monstrous archangel. Funny, true, and lots of references for the Les Miz junky!"
5,This is an amazing film of an amazing story.The best version,"I read the book, saw the musical on broadway, and watched 2 other film adaptations, but this is by far the BEST. And what is so wonderful about it is the way the characters in the movie intertwine with the characters in Victor Hugo's novel. This film is set in a different time (WWII) which only reflects Les Miz's timeless message of human suffering, cruelty, obsession, and love. Go rent or buy it now."
1,"great movie, poor DVD","I just received this DVD and returned it on the fly. These are two singled layer DVD not even fully encoded. Thus, the picture sucks, no french language track, no subtitles. This dosen't worth $20 as proposed."
1,Who can rate this movie 5 stars?!,"Whoever got the stupid idea to make Jean-Paul Belmondo act three or four roles? It's plain silly. At least his acting didn't suck, but it was neither good. The whole story is a mix of times, different and complex storylines, but all have Belmondo as the main character. Whether he's a boxer, Jean Valjean, a prisoner or whatever.Simply put: This was a long and very, very, very boring movie that I will never ever see again even if I get paid for it."
4,Glenn Miller Civilian Orchestra,"Well, we've all heard most of them before but still. For the true GM fans (as I am), impossible to refuse! The recording quality is excellent and for this much high quality compilation for the price paid... it's well worth it! Virtually no background data but once again, well worth it. Now if they could just uncover some ""lost"" GM videos."
1,Beware of defective drx-510ul,"I become one of those unfortunate customers to get a defective drx-510ul drive.I am a amateur photographer and wanted a dvd writer for backup of my digital images that run over a 18 GB bow. Bought the drive two months ago used it to burn over 15 dvds, like twice a month couple of dvds. And one fine day the burn process stopped. I tried installing all the latest updates of Record Now, My DVD software the firmware etc. I read somewhere that drx-510ul has the same internal drive as the DRU-510A. Apparently lot users who bought that also have same problem Hope this helps with your buying decision. If you buy test extensivly during the first 30 days or the return period.Pros: Fastes drive Yet. Dual interface (iLink/USB)Cons: Stopped working, defective drive.-"
3,It wasn't the best....,"I got it because John Barrowman sings ""I happen to Like New York"" on it, but it sounded like he was either rushed or so completely terrified and since he really wasn't that well known at the time, when he finished his solid redition of the song, not that many in the audience clapped. If you love Porter tunes, this is a great celebration of his work. If you purchase it because John's singing in it, then give it a pass. It feltand sounded like the poor guy was given the shaft and I really wasn't impressed."
2,Sadly Sung,"Had a hard time getting thru even one listening. The ""gala"" should have been called an old folks outing. Only John Barrowman was young enough to still be singing, and his performance is sadly lackluster. The rest of the voices are well past sell-by date."
5,"An unusual, thought provoking, masterly woven tale","An elegant, eloquent, haunting book - my copy is over 20 years old, has survived many moves and several readings. The book tells of a young anthropologist, Aaron Spenser, who comes to work on the planet Hederson's IV. His task - to observe, to learn, to record. The planet has perfected grieving as an art form, and grievers are held in high respect. Aaron comes too close to one of his subjects, and in doing so falls in love. The planet does not recognise or value love, and Aaron's actions have rippling repercussions for both his world and Henderson's IV. The unusual format for the telling of the tale - through recordings, some which have the subject's permission, some which don't - moves the tale through different cycles of life, love, art and grief."
3,"Not bad for the price, a bit small.","With this item, you get what you pay for. If you're wanting a fairly inexpensive leather vest, this works. It is a thin leather vest claiming to be genuine leather, but not very thick to take any abuse. The size tends to run smaller than normal. I generally wear a medium, but when the medium arrived, it would not fit me."
4,A keeper.,"I am 5'8"" and 157 pounds. The Medium fit is okay. The quality is good considering the price. Good looking vest."
2,Too small,My husband normally wears 2XL. I ordered 3XL to provide for room. The vest was too small. It would have been nice to know that the vests ran very small.
1,Poor Product,"I bought the Bosch Carbide hole saw, and it came with the adapter for the quich change mandrel (not Included). So in order to use the hole saw, I had to either find a mandrel or buy this kit. The Bosch hole saw requires a 16mm mandrel which I could not find anywhere, so I ordered this adapter. It fit OK but has some slop in it, so of course you don't get a good hole. I would have bought a Big Hawg except they don't make a 2 3/4"" hole saw. Bosch makes a good hole saw, but if you can't use it, why waste the money."
3,Works well but some serious cons to consider,"The Bosch Quick Change as it is now called by Bosch is a good concept that does make it about 10-15 seconds faster to change a hole saw compared to a standard 2-pin mandrel. The downsides are that the Bosch Quick Change hole saws are the only ones that work with this arbor and vice versa.This Bosch mandrel or arbor also requires a special Bosch pilot bit with a 1/4"" hexagonal base. Bosch only makes a 3"" high speed steel twist pilot bit and a 7"" masonry style bit for use with their Quick Change hole saws. If you are cutting holes in wood neither type of drill works well and slows down the hole cutting considerably. So the 15 seconds one might gain in attaching a hole saw is more than negated by the much longer time it takes to drill through most materials other than mild sheet steel (where the HSS twist pilot bit is effective)."
5,Bosch PCM38 Mandrel,The hole saws by Bosch slip in easily and firmly in this quick change mandrel.BOSCH PCM38 Bi-Metal Power Change Hole Saw Mandrel 3/8-Inch
2,Good idea but needs to be more durable,"I have gone through 2 of these in about a years time. I like the fact that the bits are so easy to change, which is what attracted em to them in the first place. After 6 months or so the ball retainer for the pilot fell out or was broken, which meant that you had to start the hole and then take the pilot out or it would fall out on it's own. The second one was destroyed when I was drilling with the 3 inch hole saw that came with the set that I purchased, and the bit actually bound in the hole and the stub that is put into the drill chuck actually bent. I am a professional remodeler and do use my tools, but I never abuse them. I can't afford to keep replacing broken tools. If you are doing light duty or small diameter holes then this is the system to get, but don't expect the mandrel to last through much in the way of heavy use."
1,Contains Sucralose,Did not disclose that it contained Sucralose - Would not have even ordered - They should disclose all ingredients! Beware
5,Best tasting protein I've ever had! (Chocolate),"I've been working out for years. I've tried numerous brands of protein. This has got to be the best tasting one (IMO). It's sweet, but not overwhelmingly so and actually tastes like chocolate. It's doesn't taste chalky at all in comparison to what I've tried in the past."
3,Decent for Shakes,"I don't know what I was thinking buying 10 pounds of this, i should of thought I'd get tired of one flavor... but that happened sooner than i thought it would. This doesnt mix well shaken or stirred, i have to put it in a blender every time. Ok taste alone, but i got really tired of it and have been mixing it with a little vanilla ice cream, frozen strawberries, and sometimes half a bananna, which makes it much better. Overall it's not the best stuff in the world but does the job, i just don't recommend buying so much of it at once. (I got some samples of BSN Syntha-6, and i'm going to buy that soon because they were the best tasting protein shakes i have ever had in my life. Every flavor, chocolate, vanilla, strawberry, and even Mochachino were excellent, I highly recommend those instead)"
2,"Works as protein, tastes like s#(%$!!!","Works as protein, tastes aweful. Stick with one of the other flavors they offer, like the french vanilla. Its not bad."
4,Not bad,"This is definitely not the best protien supplement I've ever purchased but it is adequate for the price. Flavor is good but is easily watered down, I only use about 4-6 ounces of water per scoop.This product is also much lower in cholesterol than other less expensive products and crams in just as much protein. I would buy this product again."
4,Helps me lose weight and maintain muscle mass,"I have been using this product for the past 2 years and generally have 2-3 shakes a day as meal or snack substitutes. This, in combination with exercise has helped me shed 30# and maintain it. It tastes pretty good - dissolves instantly and has a smooth texture. The amount of fat is low, but it makes a balanced meal."
2,"it arrived on time, but was damaged","This book arrived on time, but the entire spine of the book was detached which means the pages are falling out. Now I must decide to deal w/ the hassle of returning it or resolve the issue myself."
1,This phone is going straight to the recycling center,"I bought this phone to replace a 10-year old Uniden cordless phone that worked very well. This one statics on all channels, the audio fades, the range is about 15 feet, and the ringer is the only thing that works right, only so loud that it sounds like a fire alarm. The housing is light-weight, flimsy plastic that looks like it will warp.I called Uniden, they would only replace it if I mailed it back at my own expense, and kept trying to upgrade me to a better phone for ""only"" $10 and a copy of my original receipt. Amazon accepts returns only of unopened or original condition merchandise, so that's no use, either.Recommendation: Don't buy a cordless phone without trying it first."
3,No frills but works just fine,"I received my phone so soon I couldn't believe that was what was beingdelivered. It works just fine. I wish it had a vent to hook up my headset,otherwise it is just fine. I will be glad to use the same seller. Shippingand Handling is outrageous but then so is it with the other sellers. Ifsomeone would give a break on these items they would get my business andlikely most everyone elses. Just my opinion. Ellie"
4,"intense,sexy thriller brimming with intrigue,twists & turns.","Undercurrent is an intense, sun-splashed, sexy thriller brimming with intrigue and an array ofcagey characters that add to the twists and unexpected turns of this enthralling Latin noir. The film features the fascinating urban neighborhoods of Puerto Rico,including spectacular locations in Old San Juan,picturesque seascapes,palatial homes, elegant hotels, and the cockfight arena contribute to the immense verve and edginess of this lushly filmed psychosexual thriller."
3,Somewhat disappointed,"It's a nice quiet pedal. I bought this to replace another Pearl pedal that I owned that was just way too noisy for recording. I needed a pedal that was quiet and durable. And this pedal is. However, there isn't very good response from the footboard. I've adjusted the spring and it's still weak compared to the other pedal. I've adjusted the angle of the footboard and it doesn't seem to improve by much.I much prefer this pedal over the old one, but, I probably should've done more research on this pedal.I gave it a 3 only because of this. But, this is a reason to by a footpedal. Response."
4,Very nice dog beds,They looked like great little dogs beds. I had to return them because the small was made for toy dogs. I have shorty Jack Russells and they were too small for even them. Otherwise I would have kept them.
5,Great Cleaver,"Real great industrial cleaver, about 4 pounds. But only if you think you can be able to consistently chop with it. Real nice. Very strong. 9"" blade and 6"" handle!!! Total 14"". Huge!!!"
4,travel ready,I was a little unsure about how a powder versus a liquid would work. But these were perfect for travel.
5,30 Years Old and Still Drying !,"I purchased one of these exact models 30 years ago from LLBean, who no longer sells it. It works perfectly, still. I have just gotten my second one, to replace a smaller one, and wanting to be less dependent on an electric clothes dryer. The new one is identical. This is a ""Made in the USA"" product in every way, energy efficient, and holds up well. (It really does hold a full load of laundry.)"
1,SECOND BAD REVIEW-FIRST WASN'T PUT UP,"This is the cheapest piece of crap I've ever seen. We had to sand EVERY piece of it before we could put anything on it. EVERY sweater, stocking, & delicate item snagged on the splinters. We would have returned it but, it isn't worth the [...] shipping cost. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY"
5,worth every penny,"The first cut alone is worth the price of the entire CD! I've been listening to the pipes for nearly 50 years and this is the kind of recording I enjoy most. Solo piping by a master lets me hear the fingering as well as feel the music. The quality of the recording is clean and the liner notes are insightful. If you have all the pipe band recordings of Scotland the Brave or Amazing Grace that you'll ever need, don't miss this gem!"
1,bad copy,"Great introduction to Martha Reeves and the Vandellas. But QUICKSAND has some audio problems...I returned the original copy I purchased ...exhanging if for another. The problem still exists....kind of hard to describe but during one part of the song the speakers in my car sound like they are going to pop. It's not as noticeable when played on my home stereo but it's still there. Also the version found here is not mixed properly.Although HEATWAVE is played over and over again on the radio and included in so many compilation discs...the version found on this disc includes one with a longer instrumental break during the middle of the song. I've only heard this on the radio ...I assume it was a ""radio cut"" sent to DJ's. However, by adding the longer instrumental break the producer of this disc sacrifices the classic ending to the song. Bummer. The collection also features the alternate version to JIMMY MACK without the forceful drum intro. Not my favorite but still a good cut."
5,Best flashlight ever.,I use the flashlight every night to walk my dogs and the light is the best I have ever used.
2,I only received part 1,"I was expecting the full teacher's guide for 1st grade. What I got, however, was part one of two. I do not have the answer key or the additional worksheets, which are included in the description for this item. A large part of my decision to order the teacher's guide was the worksheets. Not sure what the others sellers are offering, but Media&Books;_Store is who I bought from. If the seller makes this right, I'll come back and add to my review, but I'm not expecting it.Edit 5/14/2012: The seller is going to refund my money and let me keep the book. Not exactly what I was hoping for, but at least the seller is making it right."
5,Excellent book,"Craig Karges has written a superior guide in showing all of us how to develop out intuition. All you need is an open mind and you will be astonished at what you can accomplish. Well written, this book is easy to understand, fun to try and shows what we can do if we allow ourselves. Not only intuition, but menory..all around living Highly recommended!"
5,So very much worth it!!!!,"The inside of this box is very smooth hard plastic. Stuff slides off pretty easily.I have one cat who loves getting to the bottom of the box in order to pee--no matter how much litter is in it, he has to get to the bottom. I've spent the last month scraping clumps off the bottom of boxes--and breaking the clumps in process. I changed boxes 2 days ago and no more scraping!! It is wonderful.I do wish the front was just a bit higher though--other than that it is perfect."
4,Front Wall is Too Low,"I've had this litterbox for a few years now and I love everything about it except for one thing: the front wall is too low (only 4""). I have a 20 lb big boy who tends to lift his butt up a little high when he pees and he has accidents. Obviously the box works great on the high wall side, but he tends to prefer to face the other way (why? because he's a cat).I've tried lowering the level of the litter and he's good about it sometimes, then other times he has accidents like once a week (usually at the most inopportune times). Unfortunately, I am looking for a replacement box and I'm very disappointed because this one is so cute. I love the color and design, it's very easy to clean and it's the perfect size. I just wish that front wall was higher."
5,Pink Litter Box,"I looked for a long time for the purrrfect pink litter box, as, I was getting a new kitty. After my long search, I ordered this one, and it is the best! I also got the scooper to match. I love the heart shape!"
2,Liners never fit,"My cat used the box and it looks cute, however the special liners that are required for it never fit. We ended up throwing the liners away and just scrubbing the box when the litter got changed."
3,Ericsson R300LX,"-To whoever reads this, please choose wisely the phone you get with your plans. There are some cool features this phone has, but with that said, the R300LX's battery design must be changed. I recharged it all night and only used it a couple of times(short calls) and by 400p.m. the battery is dead. So for those of you getting this phone learn to conserve battery life as long as possible. ( and if you can figure it out, give me a ring). The phone was free though..."
4,cell phone battery,I am trying to find a new battery for my ericsson R300LX cell phone. I can not find one anywhere. I came to this web site and found where it was and it is no longer in stock or now longer made. what am i to do my phone is less then a year old and I really like it. my contract with this phone is for 2 years. i really need to get a new battery. what am I to do?
2,"Julia Migenes, Smile","I guess when talking about Julia Migenes, one cannot falter her musicianship, vocal quality and perfectionism. The music in this CD is absolutely wonderful, but to my taste, most of songs a completely overdone. I really enjoy ""Harlem on my mind"" and the wonderful rendition of ""Calling You"" the best. I'm not saying that the rest of the songs aren't worth listening. They are, perhaps, better appreciated for the Cabaret type fan."
5,incredible musicians put out another masterpiece!!!!!!!!!!Wo,"Caroline's Spine totally rocks, and anything they put out is something to purchase always!!! I'm in a band called House of Woo from Mason city Iowa, and I've met them, and they are all great people; I can't wait until we start playing with these guys and other great musicians. Caroline's Spine as far as I'm concerned is right up there with the band Stryper, Journey, Led Zeppelin, The Rolling Stones, Great White, Goo Goo Dolls, Smashing Pumpkins, and all the other kickin acts ever to play here in The United States. If you haven't seen them live yet, go watch them. Last year they played in like 356 shows!!!!!!! E-mail all your friends about them. Take care, and God Bless!!!! Chris Howler Hakim drums House of Woo Peace......Caroline's Spine!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,Caroline's Spine Rocks!,I really Loved this second Album! I have even gone on to track down some of thier ealry stuff which is just a good(if not better). They are very good live as well. I've seen them 3 times and even met them. They are great guys as well. I hope to hear more from them :)
4,Just a little more time!,"Just a little more time! That is all this band needs to fill a CD full of some thing really new. They have a great sound. It rocks and then some. Vocals are creative and they are begining to show a polish many seasoned bands have missed. This album is not noise cranked loud. One song blends into another and will wear you out. If they lengthen the tracks and work on a few nice guitar riffs I cannot wait for the next release. Take this one for a test drive, see if Carolines Spine does not make you sit up straight!"
5,"Basically, a must own CD.","There is no way around it. Caroline's Spine is one of the greatest bands out there. I recently bought their ""Attention Please"" CD and its a mighty good one. In my opinion, ""Monsoon"" was better, but ""Attention Please"" is almost as good and definetely worth buying. If anybody out there has one of the four CD's they released before ""Monsoon"" and are willing to part with it, email me because I would definitely be willing to buy it."
5,Absolutely awesome,This album is just great. To know their work on Monsoon and then to hear this is absolutely awesome. The way Jimmy writes songs is amazing. The album is great follow up.
5,Mary McCormack is a goddess,This show is really great for one major reason - Mary McCormack. She plays her part as tough and smart and really fragile. PLEAE SOMEONE NOMINATE HER FOR SOME AWARD. The supporting players are equally wonderful - Frederick Willer and Lesley Ann Warren and Nichole Hitlz - supporting players you can't help but notice and embrace. But again - it's all about Mary - a truly gifted actress. Buy this DVD - one of my very very favorites. You won't be sorry.
5,Very entertaining!,"The chemistry between Mary & Marshall is reason enough to watch these episodes, but the tension with WITSEC clients just adds to the drama. All in all, an excellent show."
5,Where is Season 3?,"This is truely a great show! Watching the reaction of the cast (especially Mary's partner) after Mary is shot is truely gut-wrenching. In fact, I was so totally envolved watching season 1&2 for 2 stright days I did not realize that they were over! Hopefully, Season 3 will come out soon. I sincerely hope that I am not the only one who appreciates this show!"
5,Television DVD,"The item arrived very quickly and was in perfect condition. The purchase, etc., was very easy. I would be very happy to make further purchases from this seller in the future."
2,Disappointment Deluxe,"Though the cover indicated four episodes per disc, there were only two episodes per disc. Needless to say, I was very diappointed and felt that I had been deliberately shortchanged. I was shorted half the season. Can this be rectified? This was true of each of the three seasons I received."
2,In Plain Sight Season 2 DVD,I ordered this product paying extra for 2nd day shipping as I needed it by a particular date. I did not recieve the product until 4 or 5 days had lasped. When viewing the DVD's enclosed we found one of the DVD's to be blank. We tried to play it in several DVD machines as well as our computer DVD to make sure it wasn't due to one of our electronics. It wasn't the DVD was completly blank.So for those to things I gave this a poor review.I will say that I did contact the seller as well as Amazon and the buyer refunded my money for the DVD set as well as the extra money it cost to have it shipped 2nd day. So I compliment the seller for doing the right thing.
5,In Plain Sight Season2,I enjoy this series. It is funny and interesting at the same time. Would recommend it to others.
5,tv,I really liked the show and wish it were still on the air. The acting was very good and as were the story lines.
3,Beware the Import - all previously released material,"Attention Blackfoot fans - this 2002 CD contains the exact same tracks as the1998 CD King Biscuit presents Blackfoot Live. - only difference is order of tracks and slightly different mix (strike 1). Also, the Biscuit CD has a good phone interview with Rick Medlocke that this CD does NOT have (strike 2). The fact that the tracks are all previously released is not indicated on either the CD coveror the info sheet (strike 3). The live tracks are mostly from a show in Hollywood CA at time of Siogo and are well-played but the recording quality is far inferior to the earlier and superb 'Highway Song Live' set. The live track 'On the Run' is from an earlier Atlanta show from Marauder tour, and Livin' in the City is a fine studio track that did not appear on any album. ANY Blackfoot live rates at least 3 stars but both the Biscuit CD and the 5-star Highway Song Live must be recommended over this one."
3,Can I buy a final mem or nun?,"Nice set, except it is missing five 'final' letters - including the final mem. Makes it impossible to stamp the word ""shalom"". Of course, the box is sealed and it's not until you open it that you realize what is missing..and by then the money is spent."
5,Great book!,"This is a great book. Levon Helm has a great story to tell. I had first started listening to The Band back in the late '60s, but had never followed the ins and outs of all of these people's lives. I enjoyed reading the book and wished it was longer."
5,this wheels on fire,"Levon Helms story of the band is more american history than just a rock and roll war story . he spins a tale that takes you to the delta and all over our world . he is the best rock and roll drummer in the world , i know because he is my drummer , im dad nud of the last hombres featuring levon helm"
5,Levon's done a great job!,"This was a very enjoyable book to read. Helm gives you his bio, early days in Arkansas, on the road with Ronnie Hawkins, the Canada connection, meeting Dylan, stardom, the Last Waltz, plus behind the scenes in rock music during the 70s and 80s."
5,Godspeed ...,"As a 60-something I have been a BAND fan since way back. More importantly I'm a huge fan of Levon. This was a ""barely-even-put-down"" read from the first sentence. I got the feeling a large part of Levon came thru the co-writing and I think that was even mentioned somewhere.This book qualifies as a MUST READ for music lovers on multiple levels...1) there is HUGE amount of early R&R; history told, NOT just about the BAND but in general;2) the story of how music, in general, evolves;3) The BAND story itself.But more than that ... it's a DAMN GOOD read told by a DAMN GOOD man.Godspeed"
5,A Great Book About a Great Band!,"Though often forgetten about now, unless you listen to classic rock, The Band was one of the best music groups ever. What a group of musicians, and what songs they made. This book was written by vocalist and drummer Levon Helm. The book is great. It is not just a great book about the Band, it is a great look at rock and roll and life on the road. This is a great book about music and the people who make music. The Band was such a great group, more people should know there story."
3,the book of the band,i would have liked to have seen a contribution by robbie included and some reflection from richard. levon's time away is moved thru too quickly when he was away. i would have liked to have read more detail of his life away from music. i enjoyed the criticism of neil diamond which everyone always had of his appearance in the last waltz.
5,Read em' And Weep,"Levon gives an honest,if bittersweet recollection of the difficult years of living on the road with The Band.From young prodigal R&B sidemen through pain,anguish,suicide and remorse-he weaves a captivating tale.Delightful reading for any one envious of the glorified myth of rock and roll stardom.One of the most sincere accounts of 60's bedlam,70's indulgence and 80's malaise I've read."
4,He knows she's dead,"Here's the thing about this movie: He knows she's dead. A lot of the other reviewers here seem to forget that he acknowledges she's dead but that doesn't matter. She is dead but not gone. For some people, that statement sounds like some kind of sacchrine line to calm children. Sometimes it's the truth, though, and that's what this movie is about.The movie does take itself seriously, but the subject IS serious. This is a solid movie, it's not a great film. Taking yourself seriously is not the same as claiming greatness. David Kelly is a capable director and the cast has chemistry and participate in the telling of a good story. That's it. It's a good story, and a fine film."
5,DVD Purchase,"Fast shipping. DVD in excellent condition. Very pleased. Loved the movie and wanted to add it to my library at a reasonable price. Succeeded in doing that by shopping Amazon. Love shopping with Amazon and it's great sellers. I find products at Amazon I have not been able to locate at other websites. I have not been disappointed even once. I have it in my favorites and have often told others ""you can usually find anything you want at Amazon""."
1,Disappointing,"First of all, for the caliber of actors in this movie, they deserved a better script. Michelle Pfeifer and Peter Gallagher are class acts, but really this movie just did not dig deep enough. I have read all the rave reviews of Claire Danes, as I have read all the raves in the past and I am beside myself. I mean she has mastered the part of the proverbial angst-ridden pouting teenager to a tee. If this is her niche, so be it. The premise of the story is pretty decent -- a man loses his wife in a tragic freak accident and has a hard time moving on. Completely understandable. Then his annoying sister in law and her equally annoying husband arrive and proceed to berate the poor guy for mooning over a wife that is dead. Oh my god, stop the presses. These people had the sensitivity of androids. It would have been nice to see him kick these people out of the house, but then the film would'nt drone on and on, This is a good film for a rainy day. But I expected more."
4,Great love story,This is a great love story. About seeing your love one after they have died. You are the only one that can see this person and its your love for them that lets you continue to see them even after death. But you have loveones still and must make a choice.
1,Full Frame - Boooooooo!!!!!,"Even though this film was originally released in a 1.85:1 aspect ratio and the DVD format traditionally preserves a film's original artistry and scope, Columbia-Tristar decided to modify this film for your television set. By doing this, Columbia-Tristar make clear that they have no respect for this film and think that it's a terrible film undeserving of your money. Don't waste your money on this cheep DVD vandalization of this film. Wait until they give it a proper widescreen release."
4,Oh bella absurdita,"Not many people these days know the traditions and characters of the Commedia dell'Arte, the ludicrous and wistful clowns of Italian theatre. But don't let that stop you: the point is to suspend your belief and be entertained, and Pomerance does this with a deft romantic touch. The cast of characters flirts and farts their way across the centuries in these tales of situations gone wrong and right. Whether it's a rage of proverbs and executions in the England of Henry VIII, or a rash of impreganations in Delacroix's France, the history is recognizable but the lives are sweetly crazy. The tales are brief, but the fare is rich."
3,Great for older kids who like to build & rebuild,"My 7 year old had a great time putting the ship together, but I have to agree with the other reviewer who mentioned the durability factor. Once the ship is together it needs to stay in one spot or it will fall apart. Quite frustrating for my guys who wanted to 'play' with it after it was built. Looks good up on the shelf though..."
3,GRACMICH,"My 5 year old bought this toy with his birthday money. The figures are great and the weapon and dragon are awesome, however, the ship will not stay together. Every time my son plays with it, we have to rebuild it, making it not so much fun for any of us. It probably is fine for an older child who can fix the ship on their own, but if you have a younger child you may want to pass on this one."
2,"High on Cute, Low on Durability","First, I confess: I'm an adult and I love playing with Legos. Thus this ship was something of a disappointment. As other reviewers noted, it's very unstable; the hull wants to keep collapsing as you build on it. The dragon figurehead will fall off if you breathe on it. Since the set SEEMS to be designed to be played with -- i.e., fire the catapult, move the sea serpent, etc. -- I would think a child would be very disappointed in this as a toy. You can't play with it or even touch it. So it's reasonably fun to build but that's it -- it's definitely under par given Lego's usual attention to such details."
5,Oldie but goodie,"this tape marked the beginning of aerobics, as we know today. although some of the songs and moves are outdated, it is still a good work-out, especially for us ""oldies but goodies"" If a copy can be found, grab it. It is fun and energetic."
2,STRANGE,"I read this not knowing anything about it except the synopsis. On the surface it was good - a story of a light that gives divine grace to certain towns-people, and confusion to a killer. It was an interesting mystery, but the writer seemed lost at points, and gave the killer too much psychobabble conversation - which proved too much for the story. I read it through to the end - but found the end lacking. It is an ""okay"" read - but too ""intelligent"" to be interesting."
2,Don't Bother,"I had moderate hopes for this book after reading the good reviews here, but I have to say I was very disappointed. It started out pretty good, but rapidly went downhill. The dialogue seemed very artificial, and the whole plot involving the Light was confusing and strange. At times, it seemed touching, but mostly just strange. There are also odd sexual details that seem unnecessary to the story. I can't recommend this book."
5,An Amazing Work That Will Change Your Life,"This isn't like anything else ""new age."" First of all it's rooted in the old Nyingmapa tradition of Tibet, written by a true Rinpoche and no phony. Second of all it actually makes a whole lot of sense.I recommend anything this man writes, no matter what it is."
2,"Not unrewarding, but not the Eisenstein I would recommend","By the time he made ""Ivan the Terrible"" Eisenstein had moved from employing film montage juxtapositions to creating juxtapositions within the frame so the feel of the movie is very different from his early films. Between that change in style and the high contract lighting and the overwrought pantomime acting style, ""Ivan"" looks almost like a parody of an early silent film - despite being a talkie. Add to that the mostly static framing, the majestic but often sparsely furnished sets, the elegant and sometimes extreme looking costumes and hair and I was often reminded of nothing so much as the old Buck Rogers and Flash Gordon serials I watched on television as a kid - but with Ming the Merciless as the hero - and without much of the action.Not unrewarding, but not the Eisenstein I would recommend."
3,Does the job,"The one I got was not particularly smooth, due to the nut on one end being ata slight angle. The addition of a washer and some grease helped out quite abit though. Smoothness aside, it worked quite well in providing the abilityto tilt the engine or flatten it out however you need to. Was most helpfulin getting the engine out and back in, as level wouldn't have quite cut it forthis particular car. Certainly cheap enough!"
3,"All My Children, a little disappointed","I'm a longtime fan of All My Children and bought this tape thinking I would get an overview of this fabulous soap, but instead too much time was spent talking about the production of the soap by producers and people behind the scenes that we don't care about. I wouldn't have bought this if I had known it wouldn't be strickly about Erica, Adam, Tad, Brooke, Phoebe, Myrtle, Mona and the rest of these old beloved characters. Not interested in how the show is made, just wanted more of the show itself."
4,Looks Good in the Garden,"We have this stand. It seems to be sturdy and looks good in the garden. From a distance, you can't determine the feel of it. We use it with a smaller globe."
1,Disapointed,The item was received in such poor condition that the receipient thought some one had left a box of trash on her door step. When she opened it the mold lines wer very sloppy and looked as though a kindergardener made it. The item had several chips in it. For the price it was a great big dissapointment. And extremely overpriced. I could have gotten this quality at the local dollar store..
5,amazing value,"I only spent about 12 dollars on this, it's worth almost twice that in any store. I'm happy with it. It's heavy duty and the pan cover is great. it's a great value ."
5,Great Covered Baking Pan,"I love this 13 X 9 covered pan! I primarily use it to bake cakes. Bakes evenly and clean up is a breeze! I was so happy to find this pan with a cover. I own many Wilton pans in various sizes. Great quality, at a great price!"
1,terrible results,"I always bake homemade cinnamon rolls/sticky buns at Christmas. I ordered these pans, along with round and square ones thinking they would be perfect. I baked them the correct amount of time as I always do and the caramel and nut topping (which is in the bottom because they are turned over right out of the oven) was hard as a rock and almost burned. The rolls also were too brown. I made another pan the same way, but baked it on a higher rack for 5 minutes less time and they weren't as brown but still unacceptable. I used my old aluminum pans for the rest........I will never use them again and will donate them to charity."
5,My everything pan,How can you not love Wilton bake ware. I get excellent results every time. And this pan with the cover is a great carry alone.
3,Scratch that,"Well, there's good news and bad. The good, the coating on this pan works very well. Everything I've cooked, from cakes to lasagna have turned out fine without sticking...sort of. No problem with the cake but the cheese from the lasagna stuck to the edges of the pan. Once soaked I was able to remove it with a sponge. It washes up well, by hand. The bad, it scratches easily. Due to a shortage of storage in my kitchen I have to stack this pan. I do stack it with the lid turned upside down covering the inside of the pan, but that hasn't save the bottom. The bottom has been scratched from stacking, pulled across a cold heating element, sea salt on the counter, and being set down on our patio table."
4,Slick,"I have 2 of these and use them all the time. They are VERY slippery. This is great for cleanup, but not so good for gripping. My enchiladas hit the pavement so now I am more careful. I realize these are made for cakes, but I use them for hot food. I love the lid (although it doesnt always snap on nicely). The pan is a little shallower than I care for, but I suppose I should have noticed that from the description."
3,A little disappointed,"After only two or three times being used it has permanent stains. I left some water in it after washing and those stains are there for life. Besides that, the top fits perfect and it seems well made. It's light weight for the double insulated kind."
4,It is just okay...,"This pan looks great. The lid attaches securely. But, my cakes don't rise like they did in my old pan."
4,"Baking even, but not sturdy","The cooking was even but the pan is a bit flimsy. It works fine, but isn't as sturdy as I had hoped."
3,Non-stick?,"Okay, so I haven't tried the pan yet, but I ordered this simply because it was a Wilton pan and I am already happy with the way they bake cakes. I have several Wilton cake pans and I was quite disappointed to find when I opened the Amazon box that this is actually a non-stick pan. I'm not much a fan of the non-stick finish because it usually scratches, peels off, etc. I haven't tried returning this through amazon yet, but as long as I don't have to pay return shipping I don't plan to keep this. It's a great price, but nowhere in the description does it indicate that the product has a non-stick coating."
1,Eh...,"This is not a perfume for me. I bought it without knowing what it smelled like. Mainly, because of the inexpensize price Amazon was selling it for. (which smells that way too, CHEAP!) It has a cinnamon scent or notes and wears off too quickly. I will not buy this perfume again. I'll give it away..."
1,cheap and smells like booze,definitly a knock off or something. the paint on the bottle was chipping and it smelled bad. not the diesel im used to
3,Liz F.,"los perfumes que he adquirido no me parecen que sean los originales, sobre todo el amarige de givenchi, la fragancia es totalmente diferente a los que he usado y comprado en otras tiendas. no estoy conforme con los perfumes."
1,STICKY AND DURTY case,"I am very disappointed with this Diesel Zero Plus Feminine By Diesel For Women. Eau De Toilette Spray 2.5 Oz.. The packaging IS A OLD, SCRATCHED, STICKY AND DURTY case! It is a first time I get something from Amazon that come in a dirty box and the cologne melted the silver finish on the pump."
4,Nice Floral Scent,This perfume has a nice lingering scent. I have gotten several compliments since wearing it. I am very picky when it comes to scents and I have to say I was impressed with this one. I would defintely buy again.
2,Did not like it,I used it once and it gave me headache. It has strong smell and I did not like it at all. I wish I could return it but looks like we cant return after opening. Lesson learnt....never purchase these kind of items without trying them out first.
3,"Quiet, indeed!","Yes, a very very quiet life. Set in post WW II England. Interesting, well written but not a lot happening. Worth reading, I guess just for the exposure to the genre."
3,A knock-off of KBFH Presents Kansas,"This is the exact same concert as on the King Biscuit Flower Hour Presents Kansas (Live recording from ""In the Spirit of Things"" tour - Feb 14, 1989: 1998 Release) but the songs are out of order. Just get the official release..."
3,Decent...for the money,"I can't really complain, I bought the software for $3.50. For what I paid, it does a great job. The software isn't as intuitive as you might hope, and the graphics aren't the best. But to just get an overall view of how your landscape design will likely turn out, it's not bad. The bad thing about this program is that it does cause Windows to crash during periods of prolonged use (usually during the walk-through/3d function), so you need to save often and be prepared to reboot your machine a few times."
3,landscaping software,"This is a good program, if you don't want to landscape your own yard. I guess it would work on your own yard, if you had all the time in the world to figure out how to do it."
1,Total Garbage - Look Elsewhere,The pictures on the box are more impressive than this piece of garbage. It's not intuitive at all. The documentation does not match the software.
4,Womanist Perspective on Healthcare,"Professor emilie townes has written an important and often-overlooked book about African Americans and health care. She begins and ends her argument with scripture, and while scriptural references are not used throughout (indeed parts of the book have not religious content at all), the ideas of her chosen scripture passages give a foundation for the book. Prof. townes has a command of the US health system (with all its problems and solutions) and deftly shows how Black Americans are too often left out of the health equation altogether. More than just another doomsday version of everything we're doing wrong in America, Breaking the Fine Rain of Death gives us hope for the future and at times concrete ways to work toward healthier communities for all. In this, she truly offers an ""ethic of care"" upon which churches and religious leaders can build."
1,"didn't work, spent LOTS of time fixing, worked some, died...","what a colossal waste of time, all the hours I spent trying to get this darned thing to just do what it was supposed to, eventually got it working, then it died completely! beware!!"
2,Problems backing up data,"I've used this drive with DVD X Copy Xpress, and it worked beautifully. The big problem I am having is adding data do a previously recorded CD-R. Before I had this installed, I could add files to folders in a CD-R using the click-and-drop function in My Computer (Windows XP). Now the Sony drive is not allowing me to do that -- it says the CD is not recordable (which is not true, since I could do that using another computer). I tried using their software, and it worked when I changed the root of the target CD, including the folder name. However, if the folder had a two word name (with a space in between), I had the same problem. I deleted ALL the recording software I had installed, inclding Copy Xpress, and still it doesn't work. It's been very frustrating (since I have a constant need to add data to CDs). Guess I will have to reinstall my old CD burner, and use the Sony drive for DVDs only. What a pain. Can anybody help?"
2,"Works fine, until it dies on you","Got on Sept. 13, 2003. Died on Nov. 26, 2003. Couldn't believe it only lasted less than 2.5 months. Aside from this not so slight problem everything worked fine out of the box. Install was easy and simple. The bundled software made it a breeze to create CDs/DVDs. It was very quiet. Burn speeds were very good. Didn't/doesn't come with audio cable which kinda sucks. Luckily I had an extra one."
1,Drive Door Poorly Designed,"This internal drive has no bezel around the perimeter of the drive door. The entire top portion of the drive's fascia opens when the eject button is pushed. This created an issue for me, a Dell Dimension 8200 series owner. The drive's door wouldn't open as the Dell's plastic trim around the outside of the bay would block the drive from opening, no matter how I installed the mounting brackets to the drive.To enable the door to open I had to remove the trim from the chasis and reseat the drive. This left an obvious opening, which over time would allow dust to get inside the PC.Sony may have gotton a clue, the 510A no longer appears on their web site. The 510AK appears to have replaced it as their 4x DVD -/+ RW offering, with a redesigned fascia.Sorry Sony, you made me spend my $ elsewhere."
1,I love Sony Products... but,"I would not recommend buying this as the drive all of a sudden, 1 month after the warrany expired, would not read any DVD disc whatsoever. I spoke with 2 other people in our office who had the exact same one, and they said that both of their drives did the same thing.I would not recommend this Sony DVD drive. I love almost every Sony product I've ever bought, but this piece of hardware is not up to their standards. Check out a different model, or a different manufacturer."
3,The other reviews are spot on...,"Software, support, and documentation are very weak (1 star), but the drive itself is excellent (5 stars).I've moved it around from Fedora Core Linux (custom 2.6.7 kernel) to Windows2000 Advanced Server and now to MacOS X (10.3.4, with Patchburn II installed), and it's been quick, quiet, and never given me any problems.I've used it for burns, backups, and restores using X-CD Roast, Nautlius, iTunes, Windows Backup, MacOS X backup, and Roxio without incident. If you try to use it with iDVD, it will refuse to burn to a rewriteable disk- install a write once disk on startup, and then change over to a rewriteable as a workaround."
3,"Good Drive, but Sony has Problems","I've used this drive for making many DVD transfers of old VHS tapes as well as burning CD's. The fact that it accepts so many formats of DVD's is a great feature. The only problem is that I can't find a VCR from Sony to do the transfers. Their tech support is horrible, and many of their products are becoming cheaper and cheaper quality. Though I haven't had any problems with this drive, I don't trust Sony as a company anymore."
2,huh??,"where this this review item come from?? oh well, it is several years old now and in an unused computer. it work ok when i did use it, the software was a bit dodgey as i recall."
1,Orange flashing light is all it does,I've had no problems with this burner until now. I've had it about three years and all of a sudden it quit working. It just flashes an orange light and will not open or read any disks. I would not have bought it had I known it would quit in three years.
1,No Good,"Only records DVD-r+r, can only use the software that comes with it (Which we all no is not the best), and can't return.Never buy, no chance, they know it is poor or they would let you return it...SL"
4,SONY (DRU510A) I Like It,"It took less than 20 minuites to install the drive, software & make a 15Gb partition on the second HD for temp. storage. When I tried to copy The Italian Job (1969 version) the SONY software would not get past the Anti-Copy. Next step was to uninstall the SONY software, then go to 321studio.com and download a trial version of DVD X-Copy Express. This lets you make 3 copies for evaluation of the product. I copied 3 DVD Movies, each to a single GQ DVD-R disk with compression done by the software with no problems. The copies played with no dicernable loss in quality through both the 510A & DVD/CD players. I could also play all 3 in a SONY DVP-NS725P player with progressive scan to a Mitsubishi 55 inch HDTV & 5.1 audio to a ONKYO A/V Receiver. No changes to the computer setup had to be made, it is a P3 1GHz CPU 1 Gb Ram WIN XP Home & 2 40 Gb HD's & 20 inch monitor. the system handeled the task very well."
3,Update on Veritas Simple Backup,"For anyone who finds themselves in the situation I did:Some additional research revealed that Veritas has licensed Simple Backup to Stomp (know as stompinc on the web). The list of supported drives at Stomp's website does not include this one; in fact, it doesn't include any Sony DVD writer. They do offer a discount on an upgrade to Backup MyPC. The list of supported drives for Backup MyPC includes the predecessor to this drive (DRU-500a), and the software does work on my system. Of course you are still paying for a capability Sony claims comes bundled with the drive ..."
1,Too technical; no pedagogic value,"This book doesn't teach you the Arabic language. It rehashes the complex grammatical concepts that make up the language. It does not use the Arabic script at all. Unlike other Hugo books I've used, this one is more ABOUT Arabic rather than how to really use it. Unfortunately, most of the Arabic instruction books I've purchased are similarly flawed. Any 6 year old kid in Palestine knows how to speak the language, but I'll bet he wouldn't have clue as to what diptotes are and I doubt he has memorized the 10 derived verb forms or the innumerable patterns for broken plurals. He just parrots what he has heard from his parents and learns to associate sounds with objects, concepts and actions. Hopefully someday someone will get a clue and produce a book based on the simple, natural language acquisition method we've all used to speak our mother tongue."
1,This Course is Bad!,"I've tried everything I can get my hands on to learn Arabic, which has to be one of the toughest languages on earth and ""Arabic in Three Months"" is clearly the worst. It teaches you some vocabulary and grammatical principles and then gives you very difficult tests which you can only do well on if you spend a lot of time doing rote memorization of the vocabulary which is a very unpleasant way to learn a language. After a short time I get a headache. I've used Hugo's other courses (""Italian in Three Months"" for example) and they are far better than this one.Hugo would do well to scrap this course and start over. It was a good plan to use Jordanian Arabic but not like this."
3,Import CD with 11 Bonus Track not listed on jacket,"This is an import CD the sound is great.The CD has 11 Bonus Tracks not listed on the jacket?! I have to say I don't realy like the tracks.Maybe because I haven't heard of them.I only bought this CD for 1 song ""Listen to the Joker"" because it wasn't on the Very Best of Jigsaw CD. I was only trying to replace the tracks from the Jigsaw LP I had.I didn't know they had more songs than the that LP.And this was one of the songs I liked form that LP.Here are the bonus tracks:13)Hanging Around,14)P-R-R-R Blues,15)Ready To Ride,16)Step On The Gas,17)Will You Catch Me,18)Home Before Midnight,19)Ripples Of The Water.20)Evey Move You Make,21)Love Games,22)Klick Me When I'm Down,23)You Are. So I hope this info helps."
2,You can find this book in a local Christian Book Store,"Those Christians who are struggling with lesbianism and want to get out of it, may find this book helpful. For information about finding a way out of homosexuality contact Exodus International in Seattle, Washington. They will carry a copy."
2,My mistake,I didn't know I was making a purchase....I just thought I was viewing a short...sort of a trailer ....one needs to pay close attention.
2,Not worth the $$$,I didn't realize that this was SUPER short when renting it for my son. It was so short it should have been offered for free to watch. He like the short clip though since he's obsessed with Toy Story.
4,Funny,"Ken and Barbie have plans to tag along to Hawaii on Bonnie's winter vacation. Sadly, Ken and Barbie get in the wrong bag and are left behind. Bonnie's toys save the day. Shark week makes a guest appearance (which make Mommy and Daddy roar with laughter). A very funny continuation of the Toy Story series, and I hope for more of these shorts."
1,Worst Score Ever,"Put me to sleep.... If you want a terrible soundtrack with Miss Piggy crying because Kermit won't go out with her... buy this junk! I accidently picked this up instead of the ""Webster TV Series"" Soundtrack. (Which I might add is probably the most briliant piece of work on the planet.) Unfortunately I opened this thinking it might be good.... and when I tried to return it they had a unopening policy. It did however fly 100ft when I threw it... which is much further than my ""Best of the Drew Carey Show"" DVD went."
3,The compilation is better&#65533;,"Listening this CD reminds me of my first compilation CD of Rodriquez, only a bit worse. It seems all the songs he does in this particular CD are not as great as his compilation album. I recommend you not to buy this CD and buy the compilation better."
5,Great quality in a small package.,"I received the JBL On Stage II as a gift. I had already had the chance to listen to one at the Apple Store and was impressed with it then.Since bringing one of these speakers home I continue to be impressed. The sound quality is great, and the compact size is perfect for my very cluttered room. Both loud and soft volumes sound very clear.I would highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a high quality speaker for a very reasonable price."
5,WOW! Compact and Powerful!,"I LOVE this speaker system. The sound quality is superb, the price is right, the size is compact, and the quality of the equipment is superb. If you're picky about sound quality this unit will be music to your ears! :-)"
3,"Not bad, for its size.","This is a good product if you're planning on using it in a small room and you're not too picky about the quality of the bass. I have to admit that I was a bit disappointed that the bass wasn't fuller than it is. Then again, when you consider the small size of the unit, perhaps the bass isn't all that bad for such a small device."
5,Great sound in a small space,"I was given one of these as a gift for around the house, and I liked it so much I came back and bought another one for the office. It is really small, but gives off great sound. I couldn't be more pleased with both of them."
4,Little Product Big Sound,"I loved this product. I had previously bought an iLive product and returned it for this one. My friend had the On Stage I and I decided to get the newer model. It works great. The sound is circulated through the my whole room, which is quite large. The only downside is that the remote, though a nice feature, doesn't let you change menus from across the room. Also it would be better if it could run off batteries instead of just the AC Adaptor. The price on amazon is the best you'll get!"
1,Terrible,"Atrocious sound. The dock is too wide for a 60GB, meaning that the wedge can (and almost certainly will) break off at some point. Returning mine immediately. And the sound . . . so awful, I was shocked."
4,nice size,I bought this for my teenage daughter. This is a nice speaker for the price. My daughter loves the size and shape. You can find better sound for a higher price but I think it has better sound than the iHome.
2,"Price okay, quality not so okay","JBL usually is a good product to buy but this item lacks the umph to make it great. The sound is tinny, there is no way regulate the tones coming from the speakers and they just don't give out very good sound.I would not purchase this item again if given the chance."
4,"Buy JBL, not Altec Lansing!","Purchased JBL speaker unit for daughter's iPod. Very good quality for price. Compact, comes with very handy remote. This unit would be great for a kitchen or study also!! One of the better products by far in this line for pricing and options.When doing price and option comparisons for iPod and mp3 player speaker products, you will also find products by Altec Lansing. I have purchased an Altec Lansing product for my satellite radio (May 2006), and Altec Lansing is a poster child company for lousy customer service and no product support. Altec is not a company you want to deal with over their faulty product.JBL Yay! Altec Lansing Nay."
1,Volume gets stuck and JBL provides no support,"I bought four of these when they first came out. At first they were great, but within a year, just beyond the warrantee period BTW, all four had gotten their volume stuck in either the minimum or maximum positions. The JBL web site doesn't even list the speakers by name, you have to look it up by model number (TEAK-48-180080000/U/M/V/VB1/A/J/K for those of you who are curious), and if you don't enter it just right, then it sends you to 404 world. Once you do get to the support page, the only thing it says to do is to reset your iPod. I don't see how resetting my iPod would help with the volume problem because it happens when I have my computer connected via a speaker cable."
5,Excellent book and advice,"Apparently I'm the first person to review this important book. I'm a little surprised about this, since Dr. Birch has excellent credentials and this is such a potentially important problem in a couple's sex life.Anyway, what I was going to say was that I was interested in this book because I thought it might help me with my particular problem, but since I'm somewhat dyslexic, I misread the title as the ""Management of Premature Masturbation,"" not premature ejaculation. That doesn't seem to be my problem. However, if I ever do get PE, I'm sure this book will be a big help. In fact, I sort of hope I do get it because it might save me some time, since I seem to have the exact opposite problem, which can be very time-consuming when it comes to sex.Well, perhaps things aren't all bad. I've been told (assuming I decide to change careers some day), that my particular problem is actually quite useful and an advantage for professional gigolos."
5,Rayovac Lantern Saves the Day in Washington Windstorm!!,"After using these during windstorms and power outages just to light our home, I was so glad I had one of these at school one afternoon when the power went out. The students felt so much safer with this lantern and the light spread out quite a bit in the classroom! The handle makes it very portable for hanging up or carrying around! We plan on purchasing more of this particular lantern!!"
4,Uneven but decent album,"Controlled Bleeding is always a gamble... with every new venture, their music changes in both sound and direction; on Penetration, you get a mixed bag that at times feels a bit schizophrenic. The first half dozen tracks are heavier industrial (the first track, Blessed Is the Burning Room, is worth the price of admission alone...) and some of the late tracks seem to blend together. If you are not a fan of piercing feedback noise, skip over Scrap Metal pt. 3 (as I do)... but make sure you listen to the gothic creep of Awakened Beneath the Ground - one of the best tracks you'll find anywhere in their vast catalogue."
5,Outandish Relationz,"This group hasn't really tipped over here in the UK ""yet"", but if they do I'm sure they'll be huge! Their previous album was amazing as is this! I think the different ethnic styles they mixing in thier music makes it easier for diferent people to relate to it, and as a muslim just like them I'm real happy to see them making it mainstream.Definitely buy both thier albums if you want a distinct blend of hip hop and RnB, just like the styles which are now travelling through the hip hop industry of mixing asian tunes in with rap- OUTLANDISH did it 1st, and make it sound hectic! 5 starz!"
4,Rap from outside the US,"Well my cousin first but on the Outlandish CD a couple of weeks ago, i thought it was just going to be another American All-Black band rapping about all their money. But the truth is the CD is my by a group of second-generation immigrants in Denmark, with their own new style. The album teels the story of living in another country, and mixes rap with R&B in a very pleasing blend, and bits of songs sung in Spanish. Definetely worth a listen."
5,Perfect addition for the laundry room.,"This drying rack is a great size, fits a whole regular load of laundry and it's made out of pine...so much better than plastic in my opinion."
2,Will not stay opened,"This is a sturdy drying rack, and can fit a great deal of clothing. Unfortunately, no matter how I position the legs, it will not stay open and folds in on itself. I end up with an envelope of wet clothes. Very disappointed that I spent so much money only to have to find a new one with leg locks."
5,"Evocative, Moving, Inspirational!","A simple story of a man's kind attempts to bring a glimmer of hope, friendship and happiness to an orphaned blind girl. Loved it!"
1,Horrible Subtitles,"I don't know if I'd like this film or not, since the subtitles were so infrequent and confusing that I had only a vague idea of what was going on.The DVD I bought was a Sony, in a sealed wrapper, even though it was from a cheaper supplier. Could that have been the problem?I don't understand how anyone could have followed or enjoyed the film with such deplorable sustitles. Simply Unbeliveable!!"
3,Good book,"Didn't really need the book, but if one is looking to for a resource to excel on the LSAT and get into law school, it looks like a good one."
5,Top Notch,"I ditto the comments of the previous two reviewers. I will add that it does an excellent job of giving a front line perspective of small unit tactics. In one part of the 1st volume, it talks about the first German retreats in the winter. In one particular account it talked about how a squad reacted to enemy fire and successfully withdrew. I spent many years in the infantry and many of these small unit tactics are very similar to what the US army teaches today. The book also gives a pretty good operational level view although it is of course more from the point of view of Spaeter fitting in his limited view during the war to what actually happened. Very good series and I'll be coming back to it over the years to read again and again. 5 stars from author to publisher. These books are about as high quality as you can get. Just holding one and feeling its weight tells you these are made to last."
5,A detailed history of a venerable military force,"This account begins with an outline of the history behind Panzerkorps Grossdeutschland. It origins are that of the ceremonial guard or ""Wache"" in Berlin, and was therefore then known as ""Wachregiment Berlin,"" formed in 1921 as part of the 100,000 man Army or ""Reichswehr"" allowed by the 1919 Versailles Treaty. As such its responsibilities included functions outside of the capabilities and duties of the police alone which included countering attempting coups with the capital city, providing honor guards for funerals and state visits, and guarding military installations. On January 12, 1939 the guarding of Reich Chancellor Adolf Hitler was added to its duties, forming under its auspices the ""Wache Fuerher."" On April 6, 1939 the order was given for Wachregiment Berlin to be reorganized into the Infantrie-Regiment Grossdeutschland. As such the new organization was in place as the war began on September 1, 1939."
4,Got to love scarface,Well I bought this a year ago just because my boyfriend loves scarface. He loves having it but he would never wear it. But at least he has it for his collection.
3,"Dark, Disturbing Film","One thing about the horror genre is that it is so difficult to define.Viewers expecting supernatural ghost stories or vampires and werewolves might be disappointed with ""Three...Extremes."" What any good horror film does however, is hit (or sometimes pound) on a key that deeply disturbs us inside.Three...Extremes is one such film and is comprised of three shorter films, the best of which being Dumplings (Fruit Chan). Though utterly disgusting and hard to watch, it is done right, for it does not rely on gore alone. Rather, it delves into the human psyche and exposes a darker side of humanity-- thoughts and perversions we'd rather not think about. To what length will one go to obtain what she thinks she wants?The other two mini-films, although not as good as ""Dumplings,"" are decent. ""Cut"" would draw comparisons to ""Hard Candy,"" and perhaps ""Saw."" The third mini-film (Miike), entitled ""Box,"" is somewhat unique, perhaps too abstract to be truly chilling."
1,WTF ???????,All I have to say is WTF??? I can never get back those 2 hours I wasted watching this crap. I am a fan of Asian movies (particularly HORROR) but I can not believe what I just saw.I wish I could give it less than a 1 star rating. What was everyone else watching???
1,3 Extremes,"3 Extremes - just terrible we turned it of about 1/4 of the way into the movie, really fake and phony nothing good to say about it."
2,"2 stars for ""3 Extremes""","I was looking forward to seeing this film due to the good reviews I'd heard and the sterling reputations of Takashi Miike and Park Chan-Wook (I'd never heard of Fruit Chan before), but I was very disappointed. Miike's ""Box"" is the best of the bunch, a surreal psychological portrait of guilt with a startling image at the end. Chan's ""Dumplings"" is an obvious, simplistic morality play with an ending I could see from a mile away. (I wonder if it plays better for Chinese speakers. It occured to me that this segment could function as a commentary on China's ""one child"" policy, but this is not evident from the subtitles.) Park's ""Cut"" is a bizarre set piece that provoked much discussion among the people I saw it with about exactly what happened and what it meant; the only thing we could all agree on was that this contrived mess wasn't worth the energy of the debate."
2,Other then 'Dumplings' it was a let down for me,"This is basicly 3 short films and the best being Dumplings. A woman runs a 'clinic' out of her flat (apartment, whatever you call them over there) and she also makes a fountain of youth, as it were, using the leftovers from her other job as the ingredients. I have a problem with that concept but other then that the movie didn't do much for me and the other 2 (Cut and Box) were forgettable. I'm not sure about the other 2 guys, but I expect more out of Miike (Box)."
3,"Good, not great, but worth buying its on sale","I'll be honest here. Of the three stories in this disc, Dumplings is the only one I really want to watch. The other two are mediocre- I can literally only vaguely remember one of the other two. Dumplings was, and will always be, remembered by me as something that made my boyfriend sick to watch it once he realized the special ingredient in the dumplings in question. All the stories are dark, and rather twisted, but due to the other two just not being so good, I wouldn't recommend paying more than a few dollars for this collection- pick it up used instead."
3,Myeh,"Not that great. Actually less than that. Pretty gross in part. More gruesome, than scary plot. 4 more words.... Done."
3,3 extemes,"Three ExtremesAlthough Three Extremes tend to catch ones awareness it does not show enough examples and details about the culture ofits immediate people. i.e. Why would people consume such things as an unborn? Showing, demonstrating and explaining similarincidents in their history would enhance the riveting power of the story. This revealed in a story real or not would showthe power of attracting the attention of the viewer. Thus, creating a power of curiosity in which a story must have and toacquire more viewers."
4,"Disturbing, but lacking","It's not so much fear as it is a sense of being disturbed that grips you as you watch 3 Extremes. True all three short films do contain their own extreme natures but they are not so much horrifying as they are unsettling. Dumplings seemed to be the most stomach clenching, and even that eventually felt like a flu you kept expecting to come back, as in you knew it was bad (upsetting) and knew it would return but you became used to its presence. On the whole all films were well done but not mind blowing. 3 Extreme's fails to live up to the hype it places on itself but remains a powerful film. Renting is recommended."
4,"A sequel to ""Eleni""","For anyone who has read Nicholas Gage's ""Eleni""--the story of his mother's death at the hands of the Communists during the Greek Civil War--""North of Ithaka"" is a poignant, yet life-affirming sequel. Gage's daughter, also named Eleni, is a New York writer who returns to the family village in Northern Greece to reconstruct her grandmother's house, ruined by years of neglect. It's a difficult job, involving an unpredictable architect, bureaucratic obstacles, and strong-headed contractors, but Eleni perseveres, and despite her cosmopolitan background, grows to love the village with its simple rhythms and closeness to the Greek Orthodox faith. Her parents are part of the story, too, as they come to visit and check on the progress of the rebuilding. The finished house stands as a tribute to the lost Eleni. A very delightful book!"
4,Refreshingly pleasant,"Eleni Cage made such a refreshingly pleasant book, like a cool glass of water in the summer.No love stories here, no soap opera sugary sweet. Just honest to goodness real people and amongst them a self fulfilment perhaps even a self discovery.As a Greek living in the city with all its distractions I find the village life and customs depicted here as interesting and quaint as anyone would around the world.And this is the success of this book. That which is deeply human is also without frontiers. I think everyone will find it appealing."
4,Discover a Grecian Villiage,"Many times you need to read a book for the sole purpose of stepping outside your own life. Eleni Gage's tale of the year she spent rebuilding her ancestral home in Lia, Greece allows you to do just that. I have read plenty of travel narratives but there are very few that describe a place with such clarity that it feels like you are actually there. The author's father previously wrote about the village of Lia in his work about his mother's imprisonment and execution there. Eleni Gage chose to return to the scene of such tragedy to eliminate the ghosts of her past while rebuilding her grandmother's house for future generations. While moving to a different country to build a home or a new life are common concepts for travel memoirs, very few showcase the emotions that Eleni Gage allows to seep onto the page."
5,Dream Story - Great Characters Who are Real,"If you didn't already know, the Nazis took over many homes in Greece and murdered their owners who refused to cooperate. This is the story of a granddaughter from NY who returned to claim her ancestor's land and rebuild the home in the same fashion as it had been built. I believe that she shares the same name as her grandmother.The village is in northwestern Greece on the border with Albania. Eleni lives in the village and hires the workers and becomes part of the community. It reminded me a bit like ""A Year in Provence"" and ""Under the Tuscan Sun"" in its humor and characters. Eleni Gage is a wonderful writer with her father being an accomplished author as well. It is a fun read that I highly recommend."
5,Inside and outside the Greek experience,"This is one of the best books of its kind that I have read, including books by Leigh Fermor.It is unpretentious, funny, poignant,and, unlike many serious anthropological works it makes Greek religion directly understandable and accessible.I think the humor comes from the movement from contrasting being a member of Lia society, in Northern Greece, to being a New Yorker. It is wonderfully self-reflexive.Congratulations EleniDr. Barrie Machin social anthropologist and authorAntarctica: A Travel Survival Guide."
5,Excellent reading!,Bought this as a gift for my mother. She couldn't put it down. Can't wait to order others like this.
4,Very handy.,"Very nice indoor clothes dryer, and made in U.S.A as I recall. That said, ours was a little tweaked (twisted) right out of the box; it hangs low on one end, an inch or more. No big deal and it is sturdy enough. We like ours and are happy to have it."
4,My wife's review !,"We are very pleased with this product. It was very easily installed even though the directions were extremely brief, but, to the point. Our only recommendation is that this unfinished wooden item should be sanded out a bit more. It is a little rough in spots and therefore, if not sanded by the purchaser, could damage very fine clothing/linen items.WKM"
1,Product Not Useful for Laundry,"""The item was not as described. It holds very little, not practical for drying shirts or pants. I contacted seller twice and was told twice that they would refund my money. Only after filing a claim with Amazon did I get a refund."""
1,Shipping nightmare,"I have been under construction building a laundry room and purchased this product to save space. It arrived when the workers were here on their final day and I needed them to put it up, but it arrived damaged, so I repaired it and hung it up anyway. The fragile rack was shipped in abox totally unprotected--no paper, packing materials, nothing! Just slipped in a thin box and sent off. The side of the rack was broken off and had to be glued. For over a $100 I would expect better packing and care."
2,Author comes off as weak and self-absorbed,"While the book is informative about the workings of the Watchtower Society, the read itself is a frustrating romp through the authors arguments with the organization. Rational readers will ask, every page, ""Well, then, why didn't you just walk away?"" As she goes into detail after detail about the incorrect teachings of the organziation, a reader will repond, ""Yes, that's why the rest of us don't join up!"" I was hoping for insights into the workings of a cult, but instead received insights into the workings of a very weak individual. Perhaps the two are one in the same."
3,A comment from a former witness...,"I disassociated myself from the Watchtower organization after being a member for 16 years, because of the shifting beliefs and the fact that the organization considers itself necessary for salvation, among a couple other things. I read this book twice and I definitely recommend it. The author was taken advantage of by this cult, and reading about her ""awakening"" is very encouraging to any ex-witness or those having doubts. I only wish it had been a little bit longer, and went into more details about her post-witness life."
5,A Mind-boggling Experience,"I loved this book for many reasons; it has a good mixture of personal experiences, extensive documentation, and the author's sense of humor and personal strength amidst of all her pain made me just want to cheer for her.As a clinical therapist, I could understand the sequence of events that led her down this self-destructive path and at the same time, appreciate her inner strength and core characteristics that never allowed her to fully succumb to the brain-washing techniques used by this organization. Reading the pages of her book and watching as her self-esteem developed, I could almost visualize the author blooming into this beautiful flower that not even she knew existed.The book itself is very thought-provoking and I learned a great deal about cults and the manipulating techniques they employ, especially guilt, shame and blame. It also reminded me that I should be empathetic to the victim's of these cults and pray too that they will have an ""AWAKENING""."
4,MANY GOOD POINTS,"I have only read parts of this book, but the parts that I have read were right on the money, especially the part about fear of demons! I was in that organization for about 30-years of my life and I can tell you that the control is SO great and yet so indescribable. Even when I left (physically) for a few years, I was still controlled by it, WITHOUT EVEN REALIZING IT.It was such a beautiful shock to me when I learned, FROM THE SCRIPTURES, that salvation is NOT dependent on belonging to a religious organization! (As the ""Jehovah's Witnesses"" teach)Yet, I did not ""throw out the baby with the bathwater"". There ARE some teachings believed by the JW's, that I still believe as truth. Such as the Trinity doctrine being total nonsense created by a much older group of mind-controllers.Lord bless"
4,Celtic Music Served 'Piping Hot',"Like the other titles in Green Linnet's Celtophile series, this release succeeds on several levels: the music is of consistent high quality, it is generous in its playing time, and it's a terrific bargain to boot.If you love bagpipe music, you won't want to pass on this collection, which features thirteen tracks from eleven artists--only Jerry O'Sullivan and the Tannahill Weavers are given two tracks each.On five of the tracks, the bagpipes are featured as a solo instrument, including O'Sullivan, Matt Conolly (a live performance), Tommy Reck, and perhaps the instrument's greatest ambassador, folklorist and story teller Seamus Ennis (1919-1982). On the remaining eight tracks, the pipes are featured in a group setting or with only one or two other instruments.There are no vocals here, so the emphasis is placed squarely on the bagpipes. This is an amazing collection. Total Running Time: 48:34 RECOMMENDED"
1,Water Damages,"when you open the phone the sticker in the back is re, which indicate have a water damages as well of the battery"
3,cant be used..,"i dont know wat to say bout this product i bought as i sent it to my son in jamestown, ny. cuz he told me he need a phone and it had to be a verizon phone, so i got him this one. but wen he got it...he was told by verizon tat he cant use it cuz it had features which would cost him 30.00 dollars more on his plan in order for him to use it. im still waiting for him to return me the phone, so i can return if it is still enough time to do so,"
2,unlocking phone,I just got my blackberry today! when I turned on the phone it is asking for a password for it... Can someone help me out what is the password is so I can take it to Verizon to hook up my phone.. Verizon told me they can't hook it up until the phone is unlocked.. So please help me out. I'm new with Blackberry!!
2,Pride was right but...,"My rotten spoiled son preferred to have no phone to this phone. It's generations old, no camera and big.I certainly would rather have this than none. Anyway the seller took it back and I was grateful."
1,angry customer,Was very disappointed in the product doesn't charge all the way can't get apps pictures or ringtones so pretty much its a useless phone to me and will not purchase another one but the company that sold it to me is a good one so ill consider buying something else from them
1,this phone is on the lost or stolen list at verizon,went to my local verizon store and spent almost an hour having them try to activate this phone and they finalally figured out with the help of customer service that this phone belonded to a corporation and that it is on a lost or stolen list and cant be used NOT A GOOD DEAL
1,WORST PURCHASE EVER,"WHAT A WASTE OF MONEY. I HAVE HAD ""CAN AND STRING PHONES"" WHEN I WAS A CHILD THAT WORKED BETTER THAN THIS PHONE AND WISH I HAD SLEPT OUT THE DAY INSTEAD OF WASTING MONEY ON THE PHONE. CAN ANYONE HELP MR TO GET A REFUND??? PLEASE REPLY TO JIMNHARM@YAHOO.COM"
1,raw deal- you cannot get web access but it requires data free of $30,"this looks great, no problems activating, but wait until you try to access the web. YOU CAN'T - BUT YOU WILL BE PAYING THE $29.99 DATA ACCESS CHARGE. This phone is missing the e-mail and browser icons. Needless to say, I am infuriated that anyone would sell this."
1,HORRIBLE,This phone does not work properly. It physically looks free of any damage but the volume does not work and it regularly does not allow me to receive texts. I have taken it to a service station and called the company about getting it reset but they say they don't know whats wrong with it. HORRIBLE BUY!!!
1,Did not work,I do not like the black berry. This particular phone never worked we'll. tried to send back but never could. It sitting in a draw not being used.
4,A great and relaxing read,This book nicely wound up the story of the valley. I enjoyed reading it and felt that the story was complete at the end.
3,Misfit of lid,"The primary use of this pot in baking bread(Mark Bitman's no-knead bread). The pot is well constructed, but the fit of the lid is poor due to the shallowness of the flange."
2,Look cute but uncomfortable to wear.,"Despite of how cute they look, I decided to give them only 2 stars. There is no padding for your feet and the shoes make loud noises clicking the floor. If you like to pamper your feet, don't get them."
4,Enjoyable reading,"I just finished this book, and enjoyed it as much as I have the earlier Peter Decker & Rina Lazarus books. Kellerman's characters are more substantial than those of many other mystery writers, and I enjoy watching them and their relationships grow over the series.I strongly disagree with the earlier reviewer who felt that the author was unfair to religious Christians. Only one character in the book fit this description, and by and large she was a sympathetic character - a good nurse, mentor and daughter.I particularly liked the interwoven relationships of the various characters, and I have to admit that the mystery itself kept me guessing to the end.I'm looking forward to reading more of Kellerman's books."
1,damaged goods,"I was unable to listen to this book because there was a loud annoying squeak and the tape would stop for no reason. I tried it on three different tape players to be sure it was not my fault. I tried other books on my players to check the players out. Definitely damaged goods. I recently tried to get a refund, but have heard nothing back."
3,"Good story, but takes a long time to get points across","I was happy with the storyline but a little bored when it took a very long time to really get into the thick of it all. I know background information is crucial, but this book definitely overdoes it! I will buy another Kellerman book to see if the next one moves along a little better"
1,Reading this was a grievous sin,"This book was a 390 page let down. Kellerman has a way to drag out a plot of nothing. I continued to read this book hoping to find something exciting in it only to get to the end and read a rather ""blah"" ending. The old mother-daughter, 1/2 sister plot. Listen to the other reviewers and read something with a little more pizazz."
1,"Humorless, with dull plot and talk talk talk","What gets this woman on the bestseller list? I thought this was very talky, with Decker & his partner often making wildly irrational leaps of logic. One early chapter seemed to be nothing but a back-and-forth between Decker & his daughter regarding a nurse and a nurse's station. Witless, too - and I mean, yes, not a modicum of WIT in this book. Very humorless. The plot is ridiculous - it really did read as if she were making it up as she went along. Not much detecting seemed to go on, either, just talk, talk, talk. Find something better to read (or listen to)."
1,"Excellent, unless you're a Christian","All of Faye Kellerman's books are well written and great fun, except when she ridicules people who strive to have a personal relationship with Jesus. While being delightfully open minded about the good, bad and complex facets of many races, men, women, professions, etc., pure contempt is reserved for those who make Jesus an important part of their lives. We never get to be neutral, good, or complex -- we get to be kooks and delusional, at the best. While many of her books ignore religious Christians, this book does not. I would advise religious Christians to avoid insult, and avoid this book. But if you already feel contempt for Christians -- Enjoy! Faye Kellerman's a great writer."
2,Just ok,"Was expecting more in the book. It's just ok. Bought it for my 6 yr old, but she doesn't get the riddles unless I explain them and some are far fetched, even for an adult. I wouldn't recommend it for a 6 yr old."
5,A must in any Statistician's personal library,"This book was providencial during my Master in Statistics research. It is THE reference when it comes to discrete distributions, a topic in Stats which has bloomed in the last two decades. This new edition covers some state-of-the-art topics in the field, such as mixture distributions and new families of discrete random variables. It is well written, but never verbose: it cuts to the chase and will be of great help to a practitioner in dire need of an arcane test. And finally, believe it or not, discrete random variables are FUN. The more you know about them, the more you perceive they can be applied in almost any practical situation. And you don't need much more than the contents of this book to be an expert."
4,Ark Angels~,"Ark Angels is a lovely installment from Sang-Sun Park. Since Saint Marie, I believe, (another great series you should buy) has been cancelled, *sob* I've been eager for another manwha. This one fits the description perfectly, as it's also slightly spiritual in tone. Three sisters, Shem, Hamu, and Japheth are charged to put some of Earth's endangered species in Noah's Ark, and then when humankind learns to respect them they will return all the animals. This series is great because:1) Fabulous art - I love the way she portrays the animal's souls.2) Awesome storyline.3) JAPHETH IS SO KAWAII! She is the absolutely most cutest (not correct grammar, I know) character in manwha I've seen so far...I just love her so much! Her facial expressions are to die for!I highly recommend this series. Pick up a copy and enjoy!"
2,Ark Angels,"I HATED this manga. It was Horrible(to me) but i am almost 18 and this was geared to younger children and that might be why.Three girls come from another dimension and are collecting all the endangered animals and putting them on an ark because we don't respect the animals...You get to see the animals souls and how the animals live...But they always have to go on a mission because the give the animals one last request, like saving thier mom, or helping them find a true love...It's cute and educational...It reminds me alot of sailor moon and card captors....If you like cute innocent storylines then this is for you."
5,Very nice music!,"I bought this cd a couple years ago off a discount rack, and rarely have I ever felt that I got more than my money's worth. This is a great collection of a capella Celtic songs that send you to another world while you listen. The artists are fantastic, very talented, and I love to sing along with the songs. I let my brother borrow it for one day, and he was instantly jealous, wanting his own copy. My favorites are Carrigdoun and the Lakes of Pontchartrain for stunning vocals. For sing-along, I love The Galway Rover and the last track (the title escapes me--but I know the lyrics). Get this cd--you won't be disappointed. It's money well-spent."
4,Ellington Standards Done By The Great Joya Sherrill,"Joya Sherrill has a very nice voice-and it would've been nice if they could've stretched things out a little more than they do here;Sherrill sings a dozen Ellington classics in about thirty three minutes,accompanied by Ellington legends Cootie Williams(t),Ray Nance(v,cornet),Johnny Hodges(as),Paul Gonsalves(ts),Ernie Harper and Billy Strayhorn(p),Joe Benjamin and John Lamb(b) and Shep Shepherd and Sam Woodyard(d).Sherrill sang with Ellington-and wrote lyrics to 'Take The A Train'."
4,"Another travel book, oops novel...","I'm a big Paul Theroux fan, so I suppose it's not a surprise I liked this book. Funny thing is, I like his travel writing a lot more than his fiction, and here he gives us the best of both worlds. Hotel Honolulu reminds me of the best of his travel books, except he's not going anywhere; he's watching everyone else pass by. If I hadn't read Floyd Skloot's Pilgrim's Harbor--which forever cured me of the dream of owning a motel, b&b, resort--it might be a little hard to believe these folks, but now I'm convinced; they're out there, and they're moving around.Sad, funny, and thoughtful, I found it a pleasure.P.S. I didn't understand the ""lar22"" vignette. Any help?"
3,extremely entertaining but with bitter aftertaste,"This book is more of a collection of short stories than a novel. By the way, I realize Paul Theroux has lived in England for a long time, but he was an adult when he moved there right? What's with the phony British accent (I happen to hear him on the radio the other day)?"
4,The other side of hawaii (or anywhere),"This was an amusing read from an author i have found to be morose and condescending in other books. It reminds me more of Larry McMurty novels, the strange cast of personalities wandering in and out of the hotel, the happy delusions of hawaii paradise. i laughed a lot, and the word play was witty. i recomend you pick it up for a good summer read."
3,"""Hotel Honolulu""","This book is written very much is the quasi-memoir form of Theroux's ""My Other Life,"" and, just like the aforesaid mentioned titled, it works. Theroux's narrator is a transplanted, washed-up writer, who moves to Hawaii from London (just as did the author) to escape the literary life. He encounters a culture that is half-formed and unliterary, which the unnamed narrator, and Theroux, seems to consider both laughable and noble. These interwoven stories carve a good depiction of modern Hawaii and the expatriates who find new lives there. For those who are familiar with the author's opinions and literary travails, this book reads like an atonement; and makes for very good, and very easy, reading."
3,Take me to Waikiki,"Hotel Honolulu contains some of the best writing I have ever read -- Theroux masterfully depicts the humorous events that occur within (and around) a past-its-prime Waikiki hotel, as observed by the book's narrarator. The novel is sort of a series of vignettes about the vacationers who briefly inhabit the world of this second-tier hotel, as well as the locals associated with the hotel (gardners, housekeepers, etc.).The problem, for me, is that the narrarator tends to be extremely condescending when describing many of the characters in the book, particularly the Hawaiian natives. The narrarator depicts most of the natives, including his wife, as ignorant and simple people. I found the ""vignettes"" focusing on this ignorance to be insulting, at best.That being said, I am glad I read the book. If you can get past the author's condescension, this is a wonderful book full of rich characters."
1,Don't waste your dime,"What a disapointment. Honolulu/Waikiki is my favorite place on this planet, bar none. The diverse culture and variety of character types presents a marvelous opportunity to create a story of gripping proportions, interweaving people and places laden with intrigue and interest. However, Mr. Threoux blew it! The characters, including the unnamed narrator, are flat and boring. There's simple no one here to care about, for better or worse. The cast rarely cross one another's paths, and in far too many instances, the exotic locale is irrelevent. If you do decide to throw good money away on this book it wont take you long to figure out that Mr. Theroux has nothing to say here. And if he wasn't a writer with a name, I doubt this book would have seen the literary light of day."
1,Hotel Honolulu,"This was a selection from a member of my book club. I thought the book was smut. The author seemed obsessed with oral sex. I found nothing redeeming about this book, a total bore."
5,The heart of me,This movie is excellent. This is a story about how destructive passion can be when focused in the wrong place.
5,Brilliant!!,"This movie is fabulous, with utterly brilliant performances. It is in limited release, but don't miss it if it is playing in your area. It is a real tearjerker. If you are unable to see it in theatres, pick it up when it is released on DVD."
2,For Heaven's Sake,"All this drama and hype for a bunch of dysfuntional people who could be happy if only they'd make the right decisions.There was absolutely no justification for Rickie to jump into bed with his wife's sister, or his wife's sister to cast off all familial fidelity for a fling for her sister's hubby. Didn't they know this would lead them into trouble?I guess we're supposed to feel sorry for Rickie who basically is at the whim of his adolescent hormones, but to finally leave his mistress and then rape his wife (!) as though she's the cause of the whole thing? What an ape.2 stars for good London sets."
5,disappointing audio commentary,"The movie was great, but the commentary is pretty awful, as the director seems largely inarticulate and has little to say. while the movie continues in full sound without any commentary (we have already watched the movie), but, then, it seems that good commentary is rare."
4,Decent Travel Dryer,"It's really small and folds to a little bigger than the size of my hand. The voltage is low enough that I won't have to worry and it's perfect for traveling because of the size. It is a European plug with a US adaptor included, but that works well for me since I am traveling abroad. It is not powerful, due to the low voltage, so don't expect a strong heavy duty dryer."
1,Useless!,I could not use this hair dryer while traveling in Switzerland because the rubber plug was big and round and made it impossible to push the metal pins into recessed wall sockets. I ended up buying a hair dryer there with a smaller narrow oval shaped rubber plug which worked just fine.
2,Not a 5 star book.,"I can't see why other rated this book 5 stars. Maybe they just looked at the pictures because it does have nice pictures of various old sheds.The book contains instructions to build one shed. They are very detailed. Too bad they are hard to follow and in some cases just plain wrong. For instance, on page 77, step 68, the author says to set your circular saw to a 45 degree angle and cut a 12' 2X4 into 6 pieces 3' long. This will result in bevel cuts, not the desired angle cuts. The instructions are written in such a way that you expected to follow them blindly without deviation. Also it is difficult to match up the relavant photos with the instructions.My bigest gripe is the drawings in the appendix. They used brown lines on tan paper with brown stipple. This makes them so hard to read they are almost useless. The full uselessness is rendered by the appendex drawings being incomplete and poorly ordered."
1,Horrible,I paid for express shipping and it arrived 7 days later. It came broken in the package too.

4,Thge Hammer hits home,Be careful not to laugh out loud or you will miss all kinds of subtle humor. I had to watch it again to see what I missed.
5,Hammer-time,This movie has it all...Hilarious yet also watchable by the females in your posse. Looking forward to The Hammer 2: Curse of the Ball-Peen.
5,The Aceman cometh!,"As a huge Adam Carolla fan, I had strong expectations for this movie. Though Adam is great on the radio and on his podcast, sometimes on TV he can come across a little bit forced. However, he plays this part well and Adam fans will really enjoy his performance. He adds some of his classic comedic stylings along with an ability to step outside his usual wheelhouse with the romantic aspect of the movie. Also, Adam fans should purchase this movie as a way to help support him and indirectly support the podcast. Great to introduce non Adam fans to him as well. Get it on!"
5,Best movie ive seen in a while!,"I rent a lot of movies through redbox but none have compared to the hammer. It was a great story but more importantly I laughed my a$$ off! Definately worth renting and christ, for $6 bucks on Amazon its worth owning!"
5,If the cover isn't eye candy enough...,"I thought this was an average, kind of boring flick when I first watched it and placed the dvd back on my shelf to collect dust along with Semi Pro and other bad purchases I've made in the past. Then all of a sudden I get an itch to watch it again because I didn't give it a fair viewing the first time thinking the Ace-Man was in it, it was going to be non-stop joke after rant after joke film like his radio show. It's just a comfortable movie to watch anytime of the day and found myself laughing harder the 4th, 5th, and 6th time I watched it especially the affirmative action line at the end of the movie should be in the top 5 movie quotes of all time. Oh and they actually comment during the commentary instead of other movies where the actors sit there and admire themselves giving no insight at all. What I'm trying to say is just see the movie"
5,The hammer,"One of the best sports comodies out there, even of your not a fan of Adam carolla this movie is halarious and worth seeing.P.S. There is no way that this movie should have an R ratting, it's just a political move by the movie industry"
5,The Hammer is Fantastic,This movie is hilarious and I would recommend it to everyone and if you are an adam fan and you haven't seen this yet then good day to you sir.
5,OUTSTANDING!!!,If you're looking for an A-typical Romantic Comedy that you won't be bored to death with while your wife and/or girlfriend is sobbing like a wet mop...? Well look no further gents. This film is entertaining as hell and is something any remotely intelligent adult couple will enjoy together.
4,Good solid-comedy,"The movie feels like a funny indie with a heart, likable characters and relationships you care about."
3,Enjoyable but not great,"This is a sweet movie and I really like Adam Carolla, but he just doesn't seem to fit the role of romantic leading man. The story has many good qualities though and I did laugh out loud a few times which is always time well spent."
2,Not as good as I hoped,"I'm a HUGE fan of Adam Carolla.There are some laughs but I found myself rolling my eyes at a few parts.The whole fight scene with the old boss towards the end- so cheesy!Or the date montage(s) with the new love interest...ugh, extra cheesy!The movie isn't awful. It's a great story about someone taking a risk and going after what they want.It just has some cheesy roll your eyes moments.I thought the ending was cute but I wouldn't recommend this movie."
5,Reg,"I loved this movie! Great humor, great story, & should not be rated R. If you watch this movie you will like it! There is humor for men and women. A love story and boxing! What else do you need! Enjoy!"
5,Great film,"Great movie all around! whether you're on a date or just sitting wanting to watch something funny, you will be impressed with this movie. worth owning for sure!"
3,Pretty Good,My husband and I weren't quite sure how we were going to like this movie. We were pleasantly surprised that we did. Wouldn't recommend for young children due to some language.
5,Watched it and LMAO,"He's too funny I love his podcast and this movie is hilarious, he really needs another movie to be produced"
4,Better than expected,Has heart. Original story line. Carolla is a decent actor. I do not have more to say but this tells me I need 10 more words.
4,Great movie for couples,"So here comes a little movie from the guy who used to host ""The Man Show,"" and is now one of the hottest morning show personalities on the west coast. This movie was much better than I had expected, and I'm a self described fan of Adam Carolla's work. This is a movie that is filled with heart and comedy. A surprisingly engaging romance along with some laugh out loud moments make this one movie that will leave you smiling from start to finish. I recommend it, if even for the fact of rewarding Carolla for taking a risk and creating something that can be genuinely enjoyable for guys and girls alike."
4,Good comedy!,"I was quite skeptical of this movie after reading all the positive reviews a few months ago. It seemed that most of them were very similar and had been written by the same person. However, I was pleasantly surprised after watching this dvd. Adam Corolla has some talent and I'm hoping to see him in future roles."
4,Solid Flick,"I wasn't sure what to expect despite hearing everyone on his radio show rave about the movie. But I think Adam is funny, so I gave it a try. Turns out I was not disappointed.His rants were enjoyable, the concepts for some of the jokes were really unique and some of the scenes were laugh-out-loud funny. Also, the boxing scenes were top notch. What really made the movie work was Adam's relationship with Ozzie. One can tell they are friends off-screen just by the way they interacted throughout the film.I want to give it five stars, but it's just not on par with movies like Usual Suspects, Godfather or Dark Knight."
5,Not just for dudes!,"I went to see this in the theatre because Adam was there in person to do Q & A after the movie and I thought...wow, he's really passionate about this project so it must be good. It was better than I ever expected and had such a great underdog story combined with a little love and a LOT of laughs! Adam is a great actor and is made for the big screen. Adam stayed for over an hour after the screening and answered questions and nothing was off-limits! He is so honest, funny and refreshingly real... I hope to see many more Corolla Comedies!Buy the Hammer, it'll KNOCK YOU OUT!"
2,Not Adam's Best Work,Huge Carolla fan but I was dissapointed with this movie. It had it's moments but overall run of the mill at best.
5,Funny and witty,This movie was awesome! A definite view for anyone who claims to be an Adam Carolla fan. Better than most hollywood comedies out today. Adam can really act!
4,Unexpected,"This is a great independent film. It obviously plays to anyone that's a fan of Adam, but I'm sure it would be funny to anyone with a good sense of humor."
4,This was a good movie,This was a funny and intersting movie. Adam is funny and the hispanic fellow was very funny. I hope this is a a spring-board for Adam and future endeavors. It does go to show you that movies dont need huge names and 100 million dollar special effect budgets to be good or great.
4,A Few Laughs,"You like this guy or you don't. Few viewers will feel neutral. Early on I wondered ""Is there really room for another boxing movie"" and after an hour of silliness I decided ""maybe just this one more."" Nothing all that new happens except that the final boxing match doesn't go where you think it might."
4,Excellent funny movie!,I loved it! I laughed my way through it! Adam Carolla is HILARIOUS! I would definitely recommend it to anyone.
3,"Likeable, but definitely a lightweight","This is at times very charming. Adam is pleasant, but the co-stars really save the film. Even though Oswald Castillo is no Dustin Hoffman, he's very amusing to watch. He has a natural presence and somehow creates interest and laughs without seeming to try at all. Heather Juergensen is a perfect romantic lead, charming and adorable, pretty, but thankfully not just Barbie doll eye-candy. Adam is not an actor, but there are worse performers to spend an hour and a half with. Adam's never terribly dynamic, but his wisecracks and his gift for carefully observed and well told complaints is without peer. I'm a boxing fan, but I don't think one needs to like boxing to enjoy this film. One may need to like Adam Carolla. I'm glad the film had a happy ending, but the climactic fight could have used more subtlety."
4,A must for Carolla fans,"A very well-made movie, with a good story, and with the right amount of humor. If you're a big fan, you'll recognize some of the jokes, but this movie should have a wide appeal. Hopefully, Adam's humor will create a larger fan base, because of this movie.In addition, this movie also has an entertaining commentary, with Adam and Kevin Hench supplying some funny insight into the making of the movie.All in all, a good movie, that is actually not deserving of it's ""R"" rating."
5,Awesome movie for everyone,"I'll keep it short:It's a funny, witty movie that anyone can enjoy. Ignore the R rating, it's a load of crap."
5,Quietly Great,"Movie creeps up on you with subtle dry humor and a good story. Only a few laugh out loud moments, but you will constantly be smiling."
4,A KNOCK OUT BOTH IN AND OUT OF THE RING!,"With a nice combination of sports and romance, 'The Hammer' is a film sure to please both men and women. Adam Corolla plays a 40 year old carpenter who could have been a contender. The story is simple Carolla plays a regular guy who doesn't apply himself and hasn't had much success financially or emotionally. He gets a second chance after his girlfriend leaves him and a boxing manager sees something in him.The film works because Carolla eases up on his usual attics and plays a very likable guy and the relationship between him and Juergensen is realistic. The film is way better than it should be and gets a boost from Carolla and the surrounding players in this inspirational and cute romance film. Hey Guys, the next time it's your turn to pick the movie surprise your sweetheart with this one! She'll like it as much as you will!"
5,Awesome Movie,"A Must see great for all ages. Disregard the ""R"" rating...damn the man. This is a PG-13 movie. Adam Carrolla is awesome."
4,The Hammer Delivered,"Unlike reality television, this seemed to be more close to home than anything I have seen in the distant past. It's a ""There is a strong possibility that I might achieve my goals through realistic measures"" type of film. Rather than manufacturing a bullet proof flight suite to defeat an unknown enemy, don't get me wrong, Iron Man is very good. This movie reminds me of a book by Charles Mingus: 'Beneath The Underdog'. So if you like an underdog story and realistic non-Hollywood solutions this film is for you."
2,"I'm a fan of Adam, BUT","I didn't think this movie was funny. I'm a daily Carolla podcast listener and am accustomed to his uncensored brand of humor. This movie seemed like a family movie and was way too safe and way too clean for my tastes. I have no idea why it's rated R. I got about 3/4 of the way through it before falling asleep, and then I threw it away. Sorry, Adam."
3,"Adam, stick to comedy bro, gross","Adam is hilarious, should have stuck to the LoveLine deal though.Relies WAY too much of carpenter humor and has a face only for radio.When he thought the audience would fall for a hott chick falling for him, it was over. Totally unbeleivable, my girlfriend and I couldn't even do it that night! Liked him a ton better before he revealed his mug.Good luck to you otherwise, Adam, you are my hero!"
2,PR Work at its finest,"There's a reason this movie bombed; it's just not that funny. Carolla is always good for a few chuckles but this movie is slow, poorly edited, and cliched as they come.I rented it based off The Sports Guy's podcast recommendation and it's one of the few times I've thought he plugged a sub-par item.It's certainly not the worst movie I've seen, the actors themselves do a pretty good job, but there is just too much for them to overcome to make this into even an average film."
2,Too many characters!,"I'm sorry Ms. Powell, but I couldn't keep up. Furthermore I couldn't finish it! Better luck next time."
2,21st Century Shakespeare?,"I should, perhaps, disqualify myself as a reviewer of this admittedly lush production, because I found the first twenty minutes of it so dismayingly bad that I did not care to watch the rest. In what I take to be an effort to make Shakespeare accessible to audiences raised on Bruce Willis and Matt Damon, director Oliver Parker delivers something emotionally incoherent, clumsy, shallow, and crass. Branagh, Fishburne, and Jocob seem to inhabit different dramatic universes. I was unable to believe that their characters had any real connection with one another. This was particularly--and painfully--true of the scene in which Fishburne's Othello deflowers Jocob's Desdemona. Exciting bedroom games for some, I suppose, but for me it was Shakespeare made vapid."
2,I dont remember,i watched this movie in my English class because we have finished reading the book. i dont remember the movie because i was half asleep while watching it. now we have to write a film review and i have no idea what to write! i hate reading Shakespeare because i have no idea what they're talking about.
5,A passionate production,"While the Orson Welles version is interesting both for its visual elements and fact that it was made over several years due to financial constraints, it does not match the passion and accessibility of the Fishburne-Branagh production.Branagh's Iago is the soul of charming evil, while Fishburne's Othello is deeply moving as a man struggling against a jealousy that ultimately overwhelms him.A third performance that rates special mention is that of Desdemona's maid (a fine actress whose name I do not recall). Although this character has virtually no lines for more than the first half of the film, she adds a sad, cynical counterpoint to Desdemona's romantic idealism.Also, the production values--the setting, cinematography, and costumes--are excellent and serve the film well."
4,Brannagh as a great Iago,"I've watched 3 other filmed Othellos (see my other reviews) and I liked Brannagh the best as Iago. Fishburne's Othello is enjoyable yet somehow affected, Desdemona can't really figure out how to pronounce english let alone speak elizabethan/jacobean prose, but Brannagh is great! I watched this film and Olivier's with my roommate who is NOT an english major/afficianado and she could understand him -- go figure. Brannagh does what he does best and he isn't anything other than himself playing Iago but he is still quite enjoyable. Fishburne hasn't trained classically but still does a decent job (and he's HOT). The only contention I have is that Parker sacrificed content for brevity,sliced and diced with the lines, gave some speeches to other characters, and relied on the sexual scenes a little much for my tastes. C'mon, look at the cover! I think it's a great starter Othello to give you the overview of the story, though."
4,"SLOW, BUT WITH GOOD PERFORMANCES","Oliver Parker's adaptation of Shakespeare's ""Hamlet"" is a descent attempt at translating the story for the screen. The story itself is a slow-going, and a bit hard to follow at times. What saves the film are some good performances by a fine cast. Laurence Fishburne is good as Othello, and Irene Jacob is beautiful and powerful as Desmonda. The rest of the cast does a good job, but the standout performance is given by Kenneth Branagh as the villanous Iago.The most interesting thing about this film is how the director makes the viewer feel a part of the story by having Othello and Iago look at the camera while giving their soliliquies. It's as if the actors are ""talking"" to the viewer, and this is quite powerful. Overall, ""Othello"" is a good adaptation of Shakespeare's play.Movie/DVD Grade: B"
4,Branaugh's Othello Rocks,"Without losing the Elizabethean venacular, this version of Othello rocks. The actors have the Shakespearean language roll off their tongues as smoothly as if they were reciting ""Old KIng Cole."" Perfect for a high school classroom if you can get away with the R-rated fantasy scenes."
2,Go with another version,"This is one of the worst adaptations of Shakespeare yet done for the big screen. The script is completely butchered and the direction is more reminiscent of an MTV video than of Shakespeare. Irene Jacob can't really speak english all that well, so the performance is completely lost, and Brannagh gets just a little too full of himslef. Try another version. Please. The Bard was never meant to look this bad. Especially not for one of his greatest works."
2,Required,This was suggested to me for my English class to help me with my writing piece but I didn't like this story anymore then I enjoyed the play. If you love Shakespeare maybe you will enjoy it.
1,Buyers beware,"I ordered this DVD because in the product description it states that it's Region 1. When I tried to play it, my player said it wasn't the right region. I cannot even return it because the slip the buyer usually includes explaining how to go about returning an item was missing. I'm sorry to have to write this because I've bought many items through Amazon and had always been satisfied till now. Still, if this can help any other buyer from going through an experience such as mine, I feel it would be remissness on my part not to do so."
3,OTHELLO,The quality of the picture was good however it kept buffering and locking up. I was unable to finish watching the movie. I wonder if I can get a credit or refund.
3,Branagh is Superb - Fishbourne is hopelessly out of his depth,"You know you have a problem when an actor declares that he didn't feel he needed to understand his lines 'as long as the voice is right.'Arrogant tosh, and it couldn't be more obvious here that the central character does not understand the compexity of the emotional journmey he is called upon to portray.Branagh is - as you'd expect - a sublime Iago, but in this case Iago's famous declaration at the climax of the action that ""what you know, you know"" seems like an ironic critiqe of his counterpart's apparent refusal to take his responsibilities to the text seriously.All 3 Stars to Branagh."
4,A Good Version...,"I have seen three other Othello movies and this is my personal favorite. From the way he looks and speaks one would not think Iago is the villain in the story. Laurence Fishburne did a good job portraying Othello and will leave one feeling almost sympathetic to his demise. Overall, it was a good movie!"
3,"Branagh, and not much else","Fishburne has energy, but no subtext; he's all bluster. He also has zero chemistry with Irene Jacob, who is shockingly awful as Desdemona. I have no idea why or how she was allowed to speak English in a movie. On a bright note, however, the actress who played Emilia did an excellent job, and Branagh's Iago is the stuff of legend. This is a must-have for teachers of Shakespeare, like myself, but not for anyone else."
3,Uneven,Laurence Fishburne goes against type and misses the mark. I'm a big fan of both Laurence Fishburne and Kenneth Branagh and bought this title on sight.As Iago Branagh absolutely oozes wrath and hatred as he stalks his Moorish prey. Branagh really takes the caricature and runs with it. His Iago loves being bad and takes pride in his nefarious doings.Laurence Fishburne unfortunately never settles in his role. His Moore is too unmilitary to be anything more than a corporal of the guard. He looks uncomfortable in that armor and lacks a commanding presence that any good general would have built in. He is flat and lacks passion . The underlay of violence that should always be under the surface is missing in his Moore. Thus why does he get enticed to marry and how does Iago set up his trap? A passionless Moore is oxymoron.
4,Signature Branagh,"The film should have been renamed ""Iago"" instead of Othello, because it's yet another ego-vehicle for Kenneth Branagh. He overshadows the main character, played by Laurence Fishburne. The film itself is gorgeously shot and very sexual, but it definitely has a modern feel to it. The cover makes it look like interracial softcore porn. It was probably intended to be a serious movie, but certain costume inaccuracies are just too obvious."
1,"Would not play = one star for seller - but 4star movie, if you can view it!","DVD would not play at all, but since I opened the package to find this out I can't get a refund. So don't buy from this seller!The movie itself, however, is fabulous! Kenneth Branaugh is a believably evil Iago. And Lawrence Fishburn shines as a strong Othello wracked by jealousy for his beloved Desdemona.UPDATE:Since purchasing, the seller has updated with region playing information with specific mention that it doesn't play in the US. Hopefully no one else makes my mistake and wastes their money. Teachers don't make enough as it is and to waste by ""trickery"" is inexcusable. The seller should be in a completely different ""foreign films that don't play in USA"" category."
3,short on color photos,"I bought this book expecting to find many, if not all of the SIGNAL magazine color combat photos, for which they are best known, under one roof. However, there are only a few pages of color photos. In addition, the B&W photos are quite grainy and of only fair quality - I think partly due to the paper used. The color photos are good quality. There is a significant amount of text, which is OK by me, but be aware if you are expecting a photo album book. More numerous and better quality photos are available in other books but at a higher price of course. The price on this book is fairly low and reflective of what you're getting."
3,I expected better,"There should have been better photos with this product, considering a lot of the Signal photography I have seen in the past. Also, the information about the way the propaganda companies collected their products didn't really do them justice. Overall, I thought it failed to deliver."
4,Heavy duty,This is a good heavy duty bottle jack. If I had it to do over again I would look for a model that was shorter and had a screw out adjustment. Jack is a bit tall to fit under some of my equipment.
4,Engaging characters and a good mystery; very enjoyable!,"Hero and heroine make this series a fast-paced treat! Ancient Rome seems very familiar; a lot like London, in fact. This is a fun mystery and a great read."
2,amateur book writing skills and bad programming skills,"Well I was expecting something a little more professional. His knowledge of the DSP world is not in debate, but his communication skills defintely are. This is not really a techincal manual, this is an 'author-having-a-converstation-about-dsp' type book. He just talks about DSP in his own words and throws out over-generalized, under-explained concepts of DSP with slight regard to audio processing, with very few real models or examples.And for you programmers like myself, his code is almost UNREADABLE! His tab formatting is worthy of a true amateur hack. Don't expect to be able to use his code intelligently without a lot of reorganizing.The book does have some redeaming qualities. Some of his explanations do manage to intrigue and delight you. However, overall I'm dissapointed, as this book was marketed more as a Programmer's bible to dsp, but there is nearly no programming examples or ideas even in the book. Just talk..."
2,Too Much Hype,"I do not believe that this is a very good book for programmers who are wishing to learn DSP. I'm sure this book is of value to a particular audience. Unfortunately, I'm not in that group. Here's my advice: if you want an explanation of how and why different audio effects function the way they do, if you want a general understanding to different DSP principles, or/and if you plan on writing your own code and need some type of direction, like a few brief examples (well-commented & an explanation of the source code), then DON'T BY THIS BOOK! As I began to look elsewhere to find the information I was looking for, I realized that this author failed to explain the topics. The source code was not even useful because there was not much of an explanation behind the work. Too much hype."
1,Fast Buck,"I was very excited about this book until I read it. It presses all the right buttons up front, but the actual content doesn't deliver. He claims to explain DSP concepts in understandable English, but every explanation is less than one page and laced with jargon like 'passband'. Even worse, he explained the one concept I was familiar with and got it WRONG! (Nyquist's limit is optimistic, but he thinks it's the highest sampling rate you'd need for a given frequency.)There were more typos and awkward sentences than usual, the guy never shuts up about how old-school and experienced he is, he uses 'affect' when he probably means 'effect', and he pads out the book with Windows programming tips and an introduction to efficient PC code.Overall, it seems like an experienced consultant with very high self-esteem trying to make a few extra bucks on the side. Please make a quality product next time!"
1,Waste of time and money,Many have already said it well - this book is a waste. Like many others I was hopeful that there would be something of value so I spent the money and what I received is an exercise in ego from someone who offers little of substance. The code is horrible. There aren't many books in this area unfortunately but unless you have money to burn it's better spent elsewhere. Nothing to see here.
1,Look Before Leaping,"I was enticed by the title and bought the book without first looking at it--a fifty-five dollar mistake! Doug Coulter probably knows digital audio processing. If you already know the subject, you probably won't want the book. If you're trying to learn the subject, you probably won't learn much of it here. Doug writes in the rambling chatty style of an old hand, but with many non-instructive, ""It turns out that . . ."" statements. If you are interested learning programming for audio processing in C++ for Windows, you may find the example code in the accompanying CD useful. The entire Help file of WavEd sums up the quality of the CD offerings: ""This app written by kids. If you don't fix it, it's your fault."""
4,DSP made easy,"This book isnt aimed at mathematicians or DSP gurus - its aimed at the engineer/programmer/musician that wants to create DSP applications. This book is easy to read but maybe a little too peppered with authors personal views. having said that this seems to remove the dryness of most DSP books around today. DSP is a feild where there are thousands of titles available but few are actually useful, especially when it comes to Audio processing. So I say this is a good book - if not for shaking off all those 'Oh my god did you see that equation!' worries. it gives the reader the background to get stuck in to a serious bit of DSP."
1,they sent the wrong plane!,"I had ordered the corporate jet plane for my grown son who is taking flying lessons. It was meant as a joke and also something he could have fun flying. Instead I was sent a fighter jet. It looks OK from the box picture, but it doesn't have the same meaning. The box hasn't been opened yet."
5,What a great plane,"This airplane really is more than I excepted. RIght when I got the package I could not wait to fly it. The assembly is easy, and about anybody can do it. It flies great.This is a good buy!!!"
1,the plane completely fell apart the first time my son flew it..not because of any misstep on his part--not a high quality item,"my 14-yr-old son wanted an RC Plane for Christmas so I bought this one after reading that it was easy to operate. The reviews were conflicting--some said it was cheap & would break immediately while other reviews extolled the plane for its easy maneuvering & resilience when crash landing. suffice to say, the former was true: the plane disentegrated upon its maiden voyage....my son has experience with RC planes & so he put it together himself & proceeded to launch it....upon landing, the plane broke apart--no, it wasn't a crash landing....just the force from a normal landing !"
4,super cool jet,this plane is a very good plane! it probaly wont last you forever. but its pretty good. it is a passenger plane as you can see.
2,Needs Improvement,"I read the reviews and bought it anyway...First I want to review the seller... I ordered it through Amazon and processed my ordered through ""The Natural Health Shoppe"". This seller took 5 days to ship. All other Items I bought through Amazon (not The Natural Health Shoppe) shipped no later than the next day. I will avoid them in the future.Now for the toy... After I read the reviews, I decided to use the two sided tape on the wings. The wings didn't fall off. Nevertheless, the plane flew very short and dived every time for no reason. The remote control is defective because when I went to use full throttle, the engines cut off. I'm glad I tested this before first flight. The first crash damaged the front of the plane. The second crash knocked off the front tire. The third crash knocked off the rear tires and the last crash the tail broke in half."
1,Do not waste your money.,"This thing broke on me as soon as I got it, the nose came off. The ruder came off and I could not fly it. Do not waste your money on this crap."
1,Not enough Power or control surfaces to control plane,"This place is crap!!!I bought this plane in July 2010.Flew it 3 times.Does not have enough Power to Steer, Climb, or maintain any attitude"
3,looks cool but not good control,"I flew this plane many times only flew once others either no takeoff or dive and crash [hand launched dived quickly and crash] now I glued this plane many times including the tale [it littrlary fell off taped and guled it on] first flight lasted about 6 seconds crosswinds blew it off course fought with the rudder didn't respond crashed about 3 seconds later. I recomend nitro planes [some planes they have might be expensive] I like there 4 chanle geebee and their 3 chanle piper cub j3. I think this fits best as a moveable model plane but thats an opoion. what do you think about it? you can respond to me if you want to,you don't have to but then if you do please let me know thanks,"
2,Not enough thrust,"this plane looked awesome and i was super excited, but when i flew it, it could not keep its altitude. i had to keep the thrust all the way up and it would still go down. It will stay in the air for about 5 seconds and then start descending, despite the fact that you have the thrust bar all the way up. very dissapointing. this also caused it to break many times, which i had to fix, making the plane look very ugly. can anybody suggest a nice begginer plane like this but you know it flies well?"
2,Revew of Earl Passager Air Plane,"Installation is easy, howevewr, the biggest draw back is that this plane is not durable and will break easly. For a child to learn to fly this plane will result in many failed attempt and that means rough landings. Idon't feel that this plane will last too many more flights."
1,Thought it couldn't get worse--we were WRONG!!!,"This was going to be a 'crash dummy' for someone still learning how to fly rc jets, so our expectations were not very high--in other words, it wasn't such a big deal if it didn't have a lot of power or maybe wasn't put together so well, and yes, we read all of the negative reviews before ordering--but that said, when we opened up the package it came in, the kit was not only used instead of new as represented, but already flown and CRASHED,ie; the nose was entirely crushed on one side, and if that wasn't bad enough, to add further insult to injury, the screws that were supposed to be used to attach the wings to the body were not even the right size, so in addition to all of the issues previously mentioned by other reviewers about the construction, quality, and flying ability of the plane, what you should know is that now there's also a question of whether or not you will even get what you pay for from the seller, so...you've been warned!!"
1,Air Earl Junk,"Purchased this unit new and was amazed at the directions for assembly. The use of the English language was so poorly written that the instructions were useless. The quality of this RC Plane is horrible. Just one bad landing (that is if you can get this piece of junk to fly) and you are looking at major repairs. Screws pulled out of the wings, the tail fin cracked in half, etc, etc. I would have been better off using the money I spent on this plane for toilet paper to wipe my butt. Next time I will listen to the reviews. I'm glad some people are having success with this product. Either, they have been so programmed now to accept the fact that China just makes BAD products, or they have better patience and tolerance than me."
4,Cool plane to learn how to fly,"The plane is very easy to assemble and flies very smooth. The chinese-english manual is as fun to read as a comic! In the beginning I had trouble with the RC and lost control within a 15 feet distance. You shold put the antenna further away from the engines and the rear servo, then everything should be just fine. This plane is good for beginners to learn how to fly, but I would NOT recommend it as a toy for a child as the pilot needs some understanding of what she/he is doing. The styrofoam is very resistant to crash landings and easy to repair with some pieces of tape. Keep in mind that the plane reacts rather slow and is VERY sensitive to wind."
1,Not worth it,"This plane broke apart on the first trip to the park. My son got about 10 minutes of joy out of it followed by alot of heartbreak while he attempted to tape it back together. The wheels feel off and were lost. The plane slammed into the ground bending the nose and tail. For the money, one would expect it to last much longer."
1,worthless junk that does not fly!!!,"this plane simply does not flyafter repeated attempts,it just kept crashing into the ground nose first:(and i am no dummy when it comes to flying,i fly helicopters which are much harder to flyin short save your money.get something in the 100.00 price range,and you wont feel like you just threw 50+ dollars away"
1,this plane is a peice of crap,this plane is clearly a peice of crap 1 its hard to assemble 2 when you charge the battery it turns really hot and feels like it will start a fire 3 it does not fly 4 the engine is not strong enough 5 it breaks when it comes for a crash landing 6 when you repair it it just breaks again 7 the ruder does not work 8 it is very hard to use if not impossible 9 it cant even fly 10 yards 10 the remote does not work 11 if this is your first rc plane its a bad experience 12 DO NOT GET IT IT DOES NOT FLY!!!!!!!!
4,rc air earl passenger jet,I am 11 years old and i think this is a nice rc airplane and it's pretty big for a 2ch plane.The plane is made in Europe so the charger uses 110v but U.S. current (120v) works with it so you can use it in the U.S.The wing screws on to the fuselage and the horizontal stabilizer is tapped to the vertical stabilizer.The is landing gear has 'sponge' wheels to make a softer landing.The twin ducted fans are very powerful.Flies nice and it can take a little wind.This is the first 2ch airplane i have seen with a rudder.
1,Piece Of Junk,This plane was a piece of junk longest flight i had was 30 seconds and i couldn't steer it in the air. I do not think anyone should by this piece of junk.
2,"The content is good, but the video is horrible","The video was horrible, having plenty of digital artifacts, and some weird looking lines at the bottom of the screen. I reccomend going with the other company who is selling the two pack. Theres has DD5.1 while this one is in mono. These superman cartoons do have historical significance and i would rate the actual movies at 5 stars, but the dvd is pretty bad."
1,Don't. Just Don't.,"As usual Amazon mixes up reviews for different versions, but if you are thinking of getting the Blu Ray, don't do it. It is the worst release I have ever seen. By a large margin. Check the reviews. They are all true - watermark, poor picture, out of sync sound. To top it off they spread material that could easily fit on one disc across two to get you to pay more. It is hard to imagine how they could have made it worse."
5,Classic Superman Still Rocks!,"The animation is great. It is exactly the same way I remember it to be when I was just a little kid. The modern superman has the true characteristics of a super man, but the classic superman has the perfect animation."
4,Complete Superman Cartoons: Diamond Anniversary Edition,Nice item with neat animation. A must for any Superman fan. My only problem was the fact the dates when each cartoon was released is superimposed at [the] beginning of each feature for a few seconds. That did not seem to be necessary since that info is printed on the box. Otherwise nice DVD.
4,An interesting experience,"Born in the 1980s, I was pleasantly surprised by the animation and overall quality of the production. These cartoons were my first experience watching the original superman series and I was very happy for making the purchase. At only 5 dollars, it is quite the bargain!The last few episodes (I forget how many exactly) are produced differently and IMO not as good as the others, but still entertaining. Overall I am very pleased with my purchase.P.S. Lois Lane is infuriating in these episodes!"
1,Do Not Buy The Blu-Ray Release,"First off, I thought I was seeing things when the disc starts out with an ad for all this New Age slop. The company is called GAIAM and boy, do I hate them. Their logo can be seen on the lower right side of the screen throughout the discs. The sound is completely off. Lois' mouth moves to Clark Kent's voice in many scenes. There is no excuse for such sloppiness. Everyone involved with this should be ashamed of themselves. They have completely disrespected these cartoons. How could they release this with such obvious flaws? It's just ignorant. Do not buy this."
1,Avoid the Blu-Ray!,"This release looks like it should be a 2-4 dollar DVD sold at a pharmacy or supermarket, not a 29 dollar blu-ray release. I've paid more for this than I have for some Criterion releases, and while I appreciate the booklet it comes with, the discs themselves look so bad I almost returned it. This is clearly an upscale from a dollar store DVD. Not to mention each short has a logo for some company at the bottom. I'm going to be asking a friend for my Warner DVD back, as this is the worst blu-ray I own. AVOID!"
1,Mastered by Ray Charles,"Run for your life! This is one of the worst looking Blu-rays yet released, jagged lines and all. BEyond description. The distributor used to call itself GoodTimes and under that moniker would on occasion put out something watchable. This isn't one of them. Doctor Who once gave another character instructions that concluded with the line""...and then run like something horrible is after you because something horrible will be after you."" He might have been talking about this release."
5,Everyone Superman Geek's Dream,"I have been a major fan of the Max Fleicher Superman Cartoons for years now! I read about this and had to review! I can't wait to get this DVD. I have seen the cartoons and I am hooked! I am wanting this DVD for the features. Of all the Superman Fleichers cartoons out there on DVD, nobody has done these cartoons justice like VCI is about to! I am in awe of how much VCI has put into this! I can't wait to get a copy of this. Heck I think I will bye some for other geek friends of mine. With the new Superman movie coming out a month after this is released...This is a DVD to get! Thank you VCI...THANK YOU!!"
3,NOT the best out there...,"This is the third version of these cartoons I've purchased, and I hate to rain on VCI's parade, but these transfers are NOT the best out there, not even close. They look about the same as the earlier Winstar version, apart from vastly better sound. And the ""Terror on the Midway"" still has the awful freeze frame opening. The Diamond Anniversary Edition from Image/Bosko is head and shoulders above this one in image quality, and any others I've seen, and boasts a complete version of ""Terror..."" (although a little scratched).This latest VCI version has nicer menus, an interview with the voice of Lois Lane, so for the price, a completist may want to own it. At least they made an effort to put out a ""special edition"". But the toons themselves are no comparison, in my book. Buy Bosko's Diamond Anniversary Edition without hesitation."
3,Super Tin,"Its ok. Very thin so when it gets bumped against a desk it leaves little dents it it.Also it never clearly stated that there was CD's with cartoons in it, which was a bonus but would have been nice to know.Overall its been good, my wife takes it to school and her 6th graders love it."
1,Terrible item. Buyer beware!,"I wish I had read other reviews before I jumped to buy this. I think many of the positive ones are for the shorts themselves or other previous editions of this item.I was very much looking forward to this, having had the original cartoons on VHS and DVD for many years. Since these shorts are public domain, anyone can release them and this new Blu-Ray edition proofs just that. First of all, each frame has a logo imbedded on the corner which is unacceptable. Second, this is not Blu-Ray quality image! It is full of artifacts and pixelized. It is just a blown up version of a smaller digitized edition of these cartoons. They clearly did not work directly from the original sources. And thirdly the sound is out of sinc. In other words, a worthless item. I returned it and I hope that someone will eventually make a decent version of these classics."
1,Not acceptable!,"This will be to the point:Sound is out of sync.Company logo is distracting.Dust and imperfections are still present, so the presentation is not pristine, as described.I recommend the same 17 episodes found on the Warner Brothers DVD set for better quality and price."
3,Read the book!,"Loved the book but was disappointed with the movie. And once again it did not match what happened in the written story. The acting was good, but the DVD was a bit dark and slow. I watched it on an airplane, so that could have been part of the darkness. If I hadn't read the book, I might have had trouble following everything. Even if you have already seen the movie, pick up the book. You will enjoy it."
4,Bittersweet story of a musician and a journalist,This is the touching true story of a journalist (Robert Downey Jr.) who encounters a gifted street musician (Jamie Foxx) and decides to do a newspaper story about him. What starts out as a professional assignment becomes much more personal as the two men interact and Downey discovers how badly Foxx's genius is marred by mental illness. The journalist learns a lot about life on the street and how resistant homeless people can be to change. The performances by Downey and Foxx are truly inspired and they are what this movie is all about.
1,"Uh, what?","Too much drama for me. I figured a Jamie Foxx movie is always an entertainig one, but this time...I did not think so. Bacame too boring fast for me."
2,"Nice Movie, If you can watch it...","I did enjoy this movie. The reason that I give it 2 stars is because of the generally retarded decision of Universal Studios/Dreamworks to copy-protect the DVD. The result of the copy protection is that the movie doesn't play on Macintosh computers. It plays fine on my Vista PC (though I now wonder if it has a Sony-style rootkit on it), but my three macs with DVD drives spit it out after trying to read the disc for a few minutes. It's difficult to say what content-protection scheme is used on the DVD -- it may just be a 'taking the DVD format to the limits' style protection, or it could be a rootkit-just-got-installed-on-my-PC protection mechanism.Remember Universal/Dreamworks, when you implement content protection on your movies, you don't hurt pirates. They're going to find a way to steal your work no matter what. The only people that you hurt are your paying customers."
2,Just OK,Not as good as I had expected being that both Robert Downey Jr and Jamie Foxx were the primary actors in this movie. Jamie Foxx wasn't very believable in his role. Robert Downey Jr. did a fine job in his role but the movie just wasn't all that great in my opinion. This is the type of movie you would only watch once and not want to see again. Once is enough for this one.
3,Nothing Special.,"This is not a bad movie. Both Jamie and Robert work pretty well with the script they were given. However, there is really nothing special about it either. The movie tries to be a tear jerker but it's hard to go there because its Jamie Foxx. I think Jamie is at that point in his career where he feels he can do anything. He should have passed on this because the script is not strong enough. The dialogue between the characters is very boring at times. And they never actually tell you what's wrong with Jamie Fox character. Is he skitso or does he have another mental illness? This movie seems more like a made for tv movie. They should have passed this one right to the Lifetime Movie Network and called it a day."
3,Okay,"Great movie, just had some problems with video streaming... My daughters Hulu was playing without interruptions but this movie kept loading throughout."
3,OK,"This movie was just OK. I was glad that I watched it but would never watch it again. I picked this one out to watch because I love the leading men. When it was over my husband turned to me and said ""next time I get to pick the movie"". Bummer!"
3,Dragged itself to the end,This is a very touching story that gripped me from the beginning. Both Robert Downey Jr. and Jamie Foxx give brilliant performances but i couldn't help but feel the movie dragged itself to the end. What started off as sweet music ended up being frustrating towards the end. Directing took a somewhat artistic angle which i felt did not add to the movie but actually took from it. Its worth watching because of its humane message and great acting but it is not a movie i would watch again.
3,Another sad look at mental illness,"The soloist is a dry and depressing film. It is well acted and effective at showing the devastation of mental illness.If you have no interest at the relationship between genius and schizophrenia, this will probably be a waste of time for you.It is a fairly emotional and moving film in places, but it does drag on in many more places, so much so that my wife left the room several times during the movie, though came back for and enjoyed the end.2 *"
4,The Soloist,"The film is a satisfying adult drama that doesn't lose it's direction. It doesn't pander to it's audience. There is no random violence, no guns, but indeed simply good story telling with great characterizations. It's a decent film that deserves better treatment in the press. It has a noble heart that succeeds in telling a great human story.It resonates and strikes a chord.http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002JQIRTO/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_title"
4,Vulnerable To Everything,"The Soloist is a film that deals with schizophrenia. It shows us how this psychological disorder turns a life upside down. The Soloist also shows how much pressure Africans in America are under when they pursue mastery of anything. The movie mostly shows how inadequate the United State's response is to mental illness. If you have a mental illness in the U. S. you may be eligible for resources from the government or a foundation. That is if you are not too ill to navigate through a process that most healthy people do not understand. The Soloist shows how the citizens with mental illness in what is called the greatest country on earth have no protection. Nothing in the vast American system reaches out to the mentally ill in any sufficient way. The Soloist shows you the life of a man suffering with mental illness, vulnerable to everything."
3,Muddled Screenplay for Poignant True Story,"""The Soloist"" is a true life drama that tells the poignant tale of how the paths of a Los Angeles newspaper reporter, Steve Lopez (Robert Downey, Jr.) cross paths of a homeless street musician Nathaniel Ayres (Jaime Fox).Nathaniel Ayres is schizophrenic and unable to relate to the real world unless it is through music. He was a brilliant and promising young musician that went to the Juilliard School of Music, but dropped out due to his mental condition. Nathanial and Steve becomes friends and battle their demons together.There are a couple of discordant scenes involving urine and also unnecessary flash-backs depicting Nathanial's earlier life. This did little to move the story on as he is obviously a mentally impaired homeless person struggling with fears deep within.The muddled screenplay did not do justice to the story of Nathanial Ayres and Steve Lopez. The strength of the message was lost, however, the unique and poignant friendship was showcased well."
5,Bulbs for 12G Nano Cube,"I purchased these bulbs as replacements for the original bulbs in my 12G Nano-Cube, these are better I think for my tropical freshwater fish than those originally supplied."
2,BEGINNERS BOOK,This book is a beginners book it truely does not get indepth into what happens and how to deal with the bank on short sales or buying the note.
5,Must reading for film lovers,"For anyone who cares about film as an art form (even if that seems like a quaint concept these days), Jonathan Rosenbaum's MOVIE WARS is must reading. Rosenbaum incisively and wittily dissects the way that the large body of filmgoers have become little more than puppets of studio marketing departments, manipulated, pandered to, treated with contempt and condescension, and ultimately given fewer and fewer real choices about which movies to watch. This is a disturbing and darkly humorous book that says a great deal about our materialistic society. It should serve as a cautionary tale as we ponder the future of culture in this new millennium. Will films survive as an art form? Read Rosenbaum and think seriously about the question."
3,"Accurate, but nothing special","The maps are easy to read, clear, and accurate, so far as I can tell. My one complaint is that it doesn't list which streets are one-way, which is essential to know in Providence."
4,Mind Reader,"Was an ok read but there were times that I wanted to strangle the main character Caron. A huge portion of the book could have been cut if the characters had a conversation. Now, I'm all for a character getting mad and stomping off all while drawing the wrong conclusions (did he really sleep with her, did she really say that about me, etc) but when it becomes a total cliche just to fill word count - that's when I have a problem. Sure we all get huffy and want to storm off when someone pisses us off but like I said, a huge chunk of the book could be cut if not for the ""misunderstandings"" and lack of communication.Overall though I liked the book. It had a good plot and kept me wondering what was going to happen to the main character. The ending drew everything total nice and neat."
4,Pleasant rainy day entertainment,I don't usually read romances. The plot description piqued my interest. The suspense drew me in and kept me reading. This isn't a bodice-ripping romance but has some steam. Altogether it was a pleasant rainy day's entertainment.
2,Not pleased,"I had a very hard time getting into this book. So much so, I didn't even finish reading it. I have it set aside for another time, when no other book interests me. If there is something else on your reading wish list, I would suggest going with that first."
3,A Good Introductory Overview,"This book provides a good objective overview of the entire New Testament. The books are grouped thematically in order of appearance. This book was originally written in the 60's so it does lack some of the more recent and critical textual studies that have been developed. In fairness, it does discuss some of the difficulties surrounding authorship and dates that still exist.Each book is broken down with the use of an overview, main themes, and critical passages. A basic outline of each book is also provided. There are study group questions and application ideas presented at the end of each chapter if you are looking for general questions best served for Sunday school classes, study groups, etc.If your Bible is simply the text without any commentary, this little text will prove helpful. However, most of what is contained here is general in scope and contained at the beginning of each book in most mid-range to high-range study bibles in print today."
3,Wonderful insights of village life in Eastern Bolivia.,"To understand Bolivia, you must understand its people and culture. This book provides a special insiders look at family and village life in the Eastern lowlands of Bolivia. It is the story of a simple,yet proud people as they care for each other and survive against nature, and the grinding poverty of a low income developing country. Yet the love and campassion of a young Peace Corps volunteer and her adopted community make this a story of commitment,love, and understanding across the barriers of culture, language, and economic systems. This is a must read for Peace Corps volunteers, missionaries, or other travelers into the rural communities of Latin America."
2,Perfect Replacement,"I purchased this to replace the spotlight that came with my boat. I was glad it fit the exact specifications of the original install. No problems installing. Just took some patience to cut and re-wire the new one on the old wires. It arrived earlier than expected and after an hour or so to install, (Carefully and slowly) it works great. Turns and tilts and has a good beam for docking at night. **UPDATE** After just a few weeks, we bumped the light on the bow while putting out the anchor and now it spins freely and won't pivot. I'll contact the manufacture about a replacement part and update my review at that point."
3,not weatherprof,I have had this spotlight for about 5 years. It just failed. I opened it up and found that it is NOT warerprof! The shell splits top and bottom and at the seam some moisture seeps in. Result? rust and corrosion has destroyed the motors. We will be replacing it with a unit that does not have seams that can leak into the innards!
4,Good and Helpfull,"Nice Ittem, will recomment to custommers, Instalation is very easy and will be able to use it in my motor home"
5,Bob Wills is still the King.....and Ray knows it,"I loved it. Will likely play this over and over. Ray Benson did a great job with the production and performances. Also, many guest artists make this pure joy. Being a Texan raised on Western and Country (in that order) this stuff is oxygen. If you like Western, swing, or blues you can't go wrong with AATW. .....""aaah.....Fiddles""................"
5,Worth 10 Lone Stars!,"Thank God for Ray Benson & Asleep At The Wheel! They get better with each album, and this is sure to be an all-time classic with so many talented guests joining in the fun. I recently turned a few friends on to AATW's music, guaranteeing them that they would never be bored. Put any of their cd's on either at home, in the car or bring them to your next party and have a blast! You'll be up and boot scootin' boogying in no time. Highly recommended, as are all their other albums."
3,"ride with bob,,,well ok !","i found this new asleep at the wheel cd of bob wills music to be good, but as they say you cant go back. this is not anything close to the first tribute to bob wills cd asleep at the wheel put out. it is good but not what i thought it would be."
5,"Western Swing ain't dead, it's Asleep At The Wheel!","Or so says the bumper sticker I bought at their concert and stuck on my Dobro case. This is, in my opinion, Ray Benson's best effort, with all of the great guest artists that appear on this recording. How often do you hear Willie Nelson sing a Bob Wills tune with Manhattan Transfer Company doing the vocal background? If you really love the 'Wheels other works, I believe you'll find this to be a favorite."
5,harrowing and compelling,"This book about one man's torture at the hands of Saudi Arabian officials is a must-read. To cover up internal problems, Saudis blamed bombings of Westerners on other Westerners. They then tortured the arrested into confessing. It's hard not to be irate reading this book - Saudi Arabia strikes one as the most dangerous and vile country on Earth. Sampson's survival is testament to the human spirit, and his horrific tale makes for gripping and worrying reading."
3,It's not that bad....but,"Stacey Swain deserves some credit along with Jon St. James for the sound of dance music today. Early SSQ had ideas in sampeling and driving rhythms that other ""top"" performers picked up way later. My only problem with this package is the remakes of songs from the Playback album which is impossible to find now. Stacey added a very sultry kick to these tunes and if you want something different to dance to instead of the status quo give it a try."
4,Exellent!,"Yes, the title could more accurately have been ""Stacey Q's Only Hit."" Apart from semantics this is a wonderful collection, evidently composed of pre-Better Than Heaven tracks that otherwise never got to the general public.The first several songs are remixes from Better Than Heaven. The music is more complex without smothering Swain's voice, resulting in truly beautiful tracks.Some of the songs have an eerie quality which departs considerably from the established ""Stacey Q"" sound. ""Video Girl"" in particular adds a dreaminess which I found compelling.The song ""Screaming in My Pillow"" is noteworthy for being as close to raunchy as Stacey Q has gotten. It's a bit funny to hear how the writer danced all around the word ""sex"" without ever being crass enough to use it.This is an excellent addition to my library, and I hope the Stacey Q team has more songs waiting to be released."
2,Doesn't connect.,"Stacey Q is cool, but let's face it: She had only four hits. And this CD, just like her ""Queen of the '80s"" CD, leaves out one of them: ""Don't Make A Fool of Yourself,"" her third biggest hit and a Top-10 hit on the dance charts. This oversight alone makes this CD less than exciting. It's a great song, and it should be here.And the fact that this CD contains remixes versions of her other hits, and not the originals makes this collection a stinkaroony. Let's hope some day a best-of collection is released with the versions of her hits that we know from the radio!"
2,OK if you're 14,I remember buying an album by SSQ with a really hot blond on the cover many many years ago. Little did I know that the blonde would be reincarnated as Stacy Q. Songs like Synthicide and Screaming in My Pillow (Both from her SSQ Album) had a definite effect on a young boy but once the adolescent sex appeal was gone nothing but Cotton Candy and Bubble-Gum remained...
5,STACEY Q,"STACEY Q,CONTRIBUTED SOME OF THE BEST DANCE MUSIC OF THE EIGHTIES. THIS LADY WAS DEFINATELY WAY AHEAD OF TIME. STACEY Q CONSISTS OF THREE CATAGORIES,BEAUTY,TALENT&CLASS.;*****"
1,GREATEST HITS?....YEAH RIGHT.....,"Stacey Q has as much depth as a bowl of Froot Loops.....No talent, not even that pretty, and her vocals are all covered up in production. Only one hit on this CD ""Two of Hearts"" where she repeats the title 79 times in the song....or maybe I lost count...Anyway it is a sad CD, I just bought it because it was in a bargain bin for a buck...I was curious,....but I learned a lesson I should of bought a box of Jujibees with my buck instead. Miss this one."
1,"GREATEST HITS?, UH....LETS TRY 1 HIT!","First of all this artist known as Stacey Q has NO RIGHT to put out a greatest hits album, she only had 1 Top Ten hit ""Two of Hearts"" which was fair at best, furthermore, her only other Top 40 hit ""We Connect"" the same song as ""Two of Hearts"" but with a different title barely peaked into the Top 40 in the late 80s. Staceys voice is weak at best, and her talent is lacking. This CD is a joke.....If you want outstanding pop from Female Artists of the late 80s, try Debbie Gibson, or Paula Abdul....Oh by the way Stacey can we say ......Casting Couch."
4,Indian Outlaw is the best song!,"My favorite song on this CD would have to be Indian Outlaw! That song goes trough my head for days. I am a big country fan and this is one of my favorite songs. It also includes the great song ""Don't Take The Girl""."
4,Very realistic?,"I very much enjoyed this book. At times I wondered if the action was accurate because of the very brutal nature of the actions. It almost seemed as if the author wanted to provide as much action as possible to make the book a better ""read"". I have read vast amounts of books about the Russian Front and have not seen accounts of this nature. That beeing said, I would still recommend this book to anyone interested in the Eastern Front"
4,Book worth reading,Read this book in a couple of days.Intresting. It shows how humanityacts in times of war.(no code of conduct)I will be looking for more books on thissubject (WW2) Sniping .1 What i have learned Mosin Nagaut riflesare accurate.2.It saddens me we have not learned fromour mistakes.3.Worth having in library.
5,Great read,"Sniper on the Eastern Front is one of the most astonishing World War II books I have read so far. This is a must read for any World War II freak. Sepp Allerberger is reliving his vivid memories in great detail throughout this book. It is fascinating to experience the life of a German sniper during World War II. We are so used to reading about the invasion of Normandy and the allied forces demolishing the German Wehrmacht, that we don't consider the other side of the story. This book manifests the struggle for survival and retreat of Sepp Allerberger's unit on the eastern front. Once you pick this book up you can't put it down. Great read!"
4,Sniper on the Eastern Front,The Wermacht viewpoint on the perilous life of a german sniper.Easy to read and full of the horrors and deprivations of war. Interesting to learn that the Wermacht did not have snipers until 1942/3 in any serious form. And they initially often used russian sniper rifles and ammunition!
1,its fiction/faction,"This account is a detailed first person, ground level view of a sniper on the eastern front. It reads EXACTLY like a Sven Hassel. This is achieved by the author making up the stories. He has, at most, met the sniper, Wacker, and got some brief outline stories of Wacker's actions. From these, he has written what he imagines it must have been like. He creates details and info that Wacker couldnt have known, and this pads the story out. So it is just as if Sven Hassel had written a story about wacker. God alone knows if theres ANY truth in it....maybe a few grains...Gripping, fast , trashy, hollywood war."
4,War View from German solider side,"Interesting view from a German solider in battle, in particular how they viewed the Russians as barbaric whenthey were killing just about everyone in their path. What did they expect from the Russians or any other country they went into and decimated the population."
4,Sniper Times,"A pretty good book. I have no way of knowing how accurate it is, but overall a good read. This book, Forgotten Soldier, and Panzers in the mud give a pretty grim viewpoint of the war in the Eastern Front. What these books have done is to give me an interest in reading the Soviet perspective."
1,I read it and threw it in the trash!,"I am very well read on the Eastern Front and found this book to be horrible. I would like to save you the time and your money and steer you clear of this awful book. The plot line was plodding and repetitive (e.g. retreats and encirclements, again and again) and the weak details in the art and practice of sniper warfare relegates it to a mediocre military story at best. Most distressing, there are numerous gratuitous descriptions of the torture of soldiers and civilians that does not add to the story. In fact, I believe that I recognize several of them to be recycled from other sources. Also, these examples appear lop-sided and seemingly provided to excuse German actions in this theater in which both sides created and endured barbaric conditions."
1,A dissapointment,"This book was a bit of a dissapointment really. I love to read first-hand accounts of people who lived throught WWII, but this book is not first-hand, but second hand. So somebody else tells the story of Sepp Allerberger, and I think the writer fails in really catching your interest. I must admit that after 80 pages I've had enough and I stopped reading. Would Sepp A. have written this book himself, I think I would have finished it. Now it fails to capture my imagination."
2,none of the better WW2 memoirs,"I have read some memoirs of the 2nd WW from a German standpoint and this was not one of the better. Although very fascinating at times it was also oddly detached and some of the stories about his sniping seemed ""made up"". It sometimes read as a fiction novel where he was alittle too much superman to be belivable.I also found it very strange that he very seldomly refered to other members in the squad, i do recognise that sniping surely is lonesome work but still, it was like nobody left an impression or if he held back with intent.Another thing that is getting tiresome is that is always the russians that are the bad guys doing grizzly things, but he didnt stand for a minute to think what his own country had got himself involved in.Still a good read but these factors didnt allowed me to be gripped by the story as other memoirs have."
1,"Sniper on the Eastern Front: The Memoirs of Sepp Allerberger, Knight's Cross","Rubbish. This account supposedly true is ""war porn"" at it's worst. Gratuitous in it's descriptions of the death and depravity of the fighting on the Eastern Front and in the style of 10cent Western. One had to wonder if this story is actually true. A description of the sniper shooting Russian T34 tanks through the ""petrol"" tanks and causing an explosion capable of disabling the tank is hard to swallow considering T34 tanks run on diesel, which is notoriously hard to ignite. I'm a fan of good war history, but this one is not good and of dubious history."
5,German Sniper's Memories,"This marksman waited over 50 years to tell his story of the horrors of the Eastern Front. Read this excellent book and you'll see why. Some of the images are so horrible that they are best not relived. This is a fascinating account of the making of a sniper, self-taught, learn-by-doing. Allerberger became a sniper to avoid the dangers of a machine-gunner;however,he carried his machine gun with him on many occasions and used it in many desperate situations. This book ranks with the best."
2,Not as Advertised; Biography or Novel not Memoir,"The copy I received does not have Geoffrey Brooks' name anywhere about it, though I would guess he is the translator. The author is given as Albrech Wacker. In the prologue, the author says ""After the passage of so many years it is inevitable that many of his memories had become blurred and that only his most traumatic experiences had remained crystal clear in his mind, and the biographer was left to join up these pieces of information and to sort them into a coherent and readable narrative."" In other words, the author does not even claim factual accuracy. He further indicates that 'Sepp Allerberger' is a pseudonym. This is silly, because as a winner of the Knight's Cross, the protagonist should be fairly easily identifiable to any enthusiast willing to do the shovel work, assuming 'Allerberger' was one actual person. Knowing what I do now, I would not have purchased this book, which I can only classify as a fairly good war novel."
4,Inspires and Instructs,"Dorothy Spruill Redford accomplished so much for so many people when she went in search of her family history. This book illustrates how a person who was not formally trained in genealogy can develop the skills along the way to research their family history. The movie Roots is inspiring, but many African Americans give up after they run into the usual road block most of us encounter because of our families slave history or connections to Native peoples. Reading Ms. Redford's story gives one a sense of the kinds of road blocks she encountered, and how she overcame them. Ms. Redford has given me ideas about new approaches to my research, and I have also realized that my family may have a connection to Somerset plantation."
2,MADE IN CHINA ! enough said?,"Poor casting, big dent in middle of pan, my heart sank when I saw Made in China, Amazon should let everyone know where the product is made before buying....Too bad I need it or otherwise I would return. JUNK"
5,One of the best examples of Noir,"What this great film shows is how much some viewers THINK they know about noir-cinema but how little they really do. This film is one of the few that'll make you say Wow! when you just finish it. Not only because of Olin, Gary Oldman makes his part so well that it's almost impossible to imagine somebody else in it. This is really one of the best and most interesting pieces of film noir (which means getting deep down the darkest human feelings and being able to show it on the screen) and that you'll be able to see in a long time. To compare it with such an overrated piece of parafernalia like Pulp Fiction is to show how little you understood or what a small number of noir films you have seen. Rent it, watch it, own it -you'll thank Mr. Medak for it."
3,Olin makes the movie,"Outrageous, energetic, but flawed. The only thing that really stands out in this picture is Lena Olin's wild and brutal femme fatale role. The movie is outrageous and energetic only with her presence, which made up for the movie's odvious attempt to become another ""Last Seduction"". I would watch this movie just to see Olin go buckwild on Oldman's character! Other than that, If you want to see a good movie of this genre, I suggest Pulp Fiction."
5,Hot and Hard Boiled,"Bought as a recommendation from Noirscribe on ABNA forum. Hot fast action and suspense. Great, characters, worth every penny"
5,Good background music for St. Patty's Day,I wanted to get some background music for St. Patty's Day dinner. This CD has a nice variety of Irish music (instrumental and singing) which is what I was looking for.
5,Truly amazing piece of wood.,"Mine came in the next day and was huge. It is at least the dimensions listed and beautiful. It has multiple wood colors from black t tan and 3 large prongs. It fill the center of my 36"" x 18"" tank perfectly. The fish love to swim under and around it. My Mystery Snails are constantly on it eating something, perhaps chewing the wood. This is fine because for $20 I can replace it when the time comes. It is one of my best purchases ever from Amazon. I also have a medium piece which I placed under one end to add even more caves and interest. Fabulous for any price, but especially for $20!!"
3,Disappointing,This item was very disappointing. In the photo for the item it shows a log that looks similar to a piece of driftwood. When the item arrived it looked NOTHING like the photo. The piece of wood i received looked more like a spike or a volcano (though there is no hole) than a log and it was smaller than i expected. The wood quality seems ok and shipping was quick which is why i gave it 3 stars but don't trust the picture because what will be shipped to you wont be that shape.
1,Smaller than described,"One star because it was shipped out quickly. Soo disappointed. The piece sent to me had no shape, flat and was only 15""! Now I have to go through the trouble of returning the item."
4,Large Driftwood,"The piece I received was 20""long X 15""wide X 4""thick. This piece was large, heavy, and nice looking. But, I was hoping to get something more branchy and less loggy. It is a nice piece and I'm not mad that I didn't get what I was hoping for. Driftwood varies and you kind of just have to take what you get. They shipped to Hawaii and this is not light, shipping probably cost just as much or more than the piece, but I got free shipping, so this was a great deal."
3,mazel-tov planner,This product has a lot of quirks. Many updates. difficult to use for consecutive bar mitzvahs if you plan on using it for more than one year. To get support you need to upgrade or get locked out.
5,Asbergers Kids should watch this!,"My 13 year old son has asbergers syndrome and really relates to Monk as a character. Monk is much more obsessive than our son but we all got laughs out of the ""food can't touch on the plate"" and ""I don't have issues with change. I just don't want to be there when it happens.."" kind of comments. They certainly hit home and due to the fact that Monk was able to verbalize some of these issues, we were all able to laugh about them and then talk about it afterwards. Great show. Very funny. Also, we believe the message that Monk can be successful as a human and a working professional even with all his OCD issues gives hopes to those who might exhibit some of these traits that there is life even with difficulties."
5,MONK: THE OBSESSIVE COMPULSION COLLECTION,JUST FIRST CLASS TV. CAN'T THINK OF ANYTHING BETTEROUT THERE RIGHT NOW.
1,Try calling it Monk; The stupid Cheap DVD collection.....,"Worst DVD collection ever (then again it's Universal so why be surprised).I can not see the appeal of this show at all, It's just useless unfunny jokes and terrible acting."
5,Am I ever going to see my favorite cartoon again???,"This show had to be one of the most funny if not funniest show by nick. It had comedy,comedy and more comedy. I feel bad for younger kids who missed out on this. Hefer Fillburt, they're all great. I'm soooo going to buy this."
1,too muture to be on nickolodean,"i think this show is too mature to air on nickolodean i mean stuff like the naked sceans (well they didetn show it but still)? COME ON2nd of all the blood on this show i remember an episode where a persons hands got cut off and they showed ALOT OF blood you gotta be kidding me!3rd the violenceit has too much violenceand also the language in this show i remember an episode where that cow i think it was rocko's friend he went to hell and there was a sign that said ""welcome to hell"" but instead of putting that word they put the word ""heck"" but you can see the word ""hell""and this show is a TV-Y rating i think it deservers to be aTV-PG rating"
5,ahhh......Rocko i miss u,"i remember when this came out, i loved it. im fifteen now and my friends and i still talk about the episodes like when Heffervideo tapes Rocko ""[naked], [naked], without the apparel""i miss this show so much. i remember when Nick had all the good shows. Are u afraid of the dark, wild and crazy kids, hey dude,salute your shorts, weinerville, what would you do?,doug, ren and stimpy, legends of the hidden temple(my fav game show). pete and pete!!?! What happened to u Nick? now i gotta watch 6 hours of rugrats!?!? plz bring them back! Ahhhh the memories...[naked]! at least be like cartoon net and make a block of the good cartoons for us...call it ""retro or classic nick"" oh remember alex mac? files of shelby woo?ok peace"
2,Waste of money,I purchased this toy for my son who loved the Mega Bloks pirate ships but this was a huge disappointment. They do not stay together and some of the pieces didn't even fit each other. I would not recommend this product - save your money.
1,If I could give it zero I would,"This toy is awful!!! It falls apart while you're building it. It's enough to make me want to throw it in the trash. My 3 year old liked the dragon that comes with it, but other than that, save your money."
4,Improves Motor Skills! We LOVE this Series! Autism Approved!,My autistic son just loves this set. So what if the top falls off once in a while. What did you expect? It's a building set intented for repeat construction. That's what blocks are for...build it up..tear it down and start all over again. I would never superglue my sons blocks together.
1,"Good performances, bad format","The performances on this CD are excellent. The 5 Browns are amazing. That being said, please be warned before you buy this CD. It's not a standard CD. The CD music side will _not_ play in many CD players. The package itself warns you that the CD does not conform to the compact disc standard. Unfortunately there's no way to know that until you've already bought the CD. DualDiscs are a nice idea, but the copy protection technologies they employ are draconian- this CD will not play in my car or on my computer. Avoid, and wait until they release a real CD."
5,Addictive,I purchased this cd after I was intrigued by a television commercial. It is now my favorite cd. I have it always playing in my car as I drive back and forth to work and then bring it into the house to play the dvd portion on my television. The music is brilliant and musicians scintillating. I only hope that the Five Browns debut cd is so successful that there are many more to follow. If you are going to buy one CD this year it should be the Five Browns.
2,Disappointed,"BUYER BEWARE! When the CD Cover warns you that the ""...audio side of this disc does not conform to CD specifications and therefore not all DVD and CD players will play the audio side of this disc."" THEY ARE DEAD SERIOUS. I bought the album, tried it in FIVE different CD and CD/DVD players - NONE of them would play the CD. Fortunately, the retailer who I bought the CD/DVD from was willing to allow me to return it (sounds like they have had similar problems!) The 5 Browns are great artists, however, it is VERY disconcerting that their CD producers/manufacturers are putting these kind of limitations on their product."
1,FALSE ADVERTISING BY SONY!!! BE WARNED,"ON THE BACK OF THIS DUALDISC, TOWARDS THE BOTTOM IT READS: RECORDED IN 24 BIT 88 KHZ HI RESOLUTION, BUT WHEN YOU POP IT IN TO YOUR DVD AUDIO PLAYER IT ONLY CLOCKS IN AT 16 BIT 48 KHZ!!!!, THIS IS A BLATANT LIE BY SONY, AND THE AUDIOPHILE COMMUNITY MUST COME TOGETHER AND PUT A STOP TO SONY'S LIES AND FORCE THEM TO SELL QUALITY RECORDINGS AND NOT THE CRAP THEY SELL WITH FANCY WORDING LIKE ""ENHANCED STEREO"" OR ""ENHANCED LPCM"" OR ""PCM STEREO"", ALL ENHANCED STEREO MEANS IS DOLBY DIGITAL STEREO, THE SAME GOES FOR ENHANCED LPCM, AND PCM STEREO IS NOTHING MORE THAN CD AUDIO!!!!, MY GOD AMAZON WILL YOU PLEASE GET A BACKBONE AND LET YOUR VALUED CUSTOMERS KNOW THAT ALL SONY/BMG TITLES ARE NOT DVD AUDIO QUALITY, AND THE DIFFERENCE IN SOUND IS NON EXISTANT, I KNOW YOU ARE AFRAID OF BIG BAD SONY, BUT GET SOME GUTS AND DO SOMETHING!!!"
2,"ok, but not stellar","The Browns are a bunch of over-hyped musicians in today's media-oriented society (aka. Charlotte Church). The recordings are nothing to write home about -- Their musicianship is average at best. Many of the pieces lacked depth of though and some of the interpretations were a bit odd. Ok, if you like ""popular"" classical music. I say skip this one."
3,Not all that impressed,"I can't help but thinking that this is just another group of virtuoso kids that is being used for the fame of another. The music lacks fullness and invention, and tends to be a doubling of a lot of standard voicing. There is some ornamentation, and there's no doubt that each of these kids is a giften pianist, but as a group, I was not all that impressed. Cute group, though."
5,The Browns are Great,I had vaguely heard of the Browns before I popped their CDs in my player. WOW!! What playing & what great enthusiasm. They obviously have fun making music together and they have the chops to make it exciting for the listener. Especially fun are the excerpts from Bernstein's West Side Story & Grieg's Peer Gynt. The DVD video bits are a nice bonus.
4,A wonderful beginner's guide to Magick,"As beginner material goes, this book is top-notch. In fact, this book is what gave me my start into Occultism. As I said, if you're a beginner this book is for you. If you're more advanced, it makes an interesting (and useful) read, but certainly will not give you much to work with that you didn't have already."
2,Inferior to his earlier works,"While Dr. Flowers has contributed a great deal to runic studies, he seems to be limited to his expertise. _Hermetic Magic_ gives a naive view of the greco-roman mystic system, which is best left untouched by him. The book is little more than a guide to setian dogma and antisemitism (e.g. creating a theoretical ""greek cabalah"" in order to incorporate the cabalah into the western world.) Overall, the book is better than most new age works, but is still far from being a classic."
4,Hermetics,There is good information to be culled. I can't recommend this for an entery level. It will have its place in my library.
5,An invaluable work on one of the most overlooked gems of Magick,"For anyone interested in Pure, Untainted Hermetic Magick, this book and Betz' Greek Magickal Papyrus are absolutely essential."
5,Fishers of Men,"I cannot give enough praise for this short video, only 18 min, but it PACKS A PUNCH! It is a beautiful rendition of the true everyday life of a priest - giving himself in service to God. The work of a priest is presented in its beauty and this video truly brings a greater appreciation for the conviction and vital purpose of these men of God."
3,A little pot.,"Item first shipped had a flaw that made it unusable, vendor replaced it. Replacement item required a little grinding inside to smoothe it but is servicable. High marks to the vendor."
5,Great Recipes and Tips,"I really liked this cookbook. It has some good recipes and I really like the sections on how to prepare vegetables, or what to always keep in your kitchen. Essential for someone with not a lot of time in the kitchen."
5,everything the title says...and more!,"I've only had this cookbooka few months and it's already got that worn, loved look to it. I love reading the sidebars for the practical insight and the short-cuts are amazing--the tips on baked potatoes alone made it worth the purchase.I recommend the White Bean Gazpacho, the Fettucine with Spinach Pesto, and any of the dips/spreads. All recipes are fundamental and easy to modify. (I mistakenly substituted Tahini for Tamari in the Lemony Maple-Mustard Dressing (numerous times) but have received tons of compliments (and admiration) for the dip with pretzels and veggies.)I love Lorna's style. Here's the ""and more"" part...if you email her your questions, she emails you back. What great Customer Service!"
5,Not Usually My Type--But,"I usually don't tune in to military/adventure sagas--glad I did! Great story, fine acting, and superb attention to detail. I know not all young midshipmen were so handsome and gallant, nor all captains so wise and honorable, but by the end of the series I felt an intense longing to stand on the deck of tall ship with a fair wind behind her. Thanks, AandE."
4,"Video Hornblower worthy, but not spectacular, version.","Having been captivated by the swashbuckling tales of C.S. Forester's series on Horatio Hornblower, I was delighted to hear of A & E's production. While a worthy production, with realistic naval scenes, the production failed to capture the depth and complexity of the character of Horatio Hornblower. Ioan Gruffudd delivered a believable performance, but the nuances of Horatio's character did not emerge. Rather, this seemed a character designed to please current sensibilities rather than capture the essense of the historical Horatio. At times, compared to the introspective, deeply principled Horatio of Forester, this Horatio was almost cartoonish. Some of this was the result of muddied, thinly produced scenes (especially the fourth and final video), which didn't allow the complexity of the character and the wrenching decisions to which he was forced to make, be fully explored."
2,Hornblower fan disappointed,"Good staging, good acting, good story...if you aren't too attached to the novel and the character. I almost shouted when I watched ""The Duel"" and saw this pivotal story turned on its head. Having seen this episode, I was less shocked when I saw the others. I donated the whole series to the public library."
1,A depraved revision of Forrester,"These films debase Forrester's character to an extent hardly imaginable. From a retiring, repressed victorian these films have created a extroverted adolescent who is purely 20th century. The stringent historical accuraccy with which Forrester crafted his novels is gone, plots have been altered to enhance the adolescent ""romantic interest"" and no relationship to the napoleonic british navy remains. An Abomination!"
5,Horblower & C.S Forrester the author of the script-wonderful,"This is a wonderful series. I bought the first boxed set as I know of the fellow from readng about him in all ten of CS Forresters books about him when I was in my teens. They capture it all so well on screen. It is a very true account of what life in the British Navy really was like then. Sheer excitement in this series so I give it five stars HOWEVER -Last week I ordered a further boxed set and two other DVDs (same series) and paid to Amazon the extra fee for ""Rapid Shipment"" only to be told that one lot will not arrive for seven weeks !!!!!! This is not good. I have written but received no reply. I live in Paris - France and ususally only wait a couple of days for small parcels."
5,MORE MORE MORE!!!,"As a lover of Nelsons Navy, It's great. Hornblower is perfect, and the idea of building an actual replica of a frigate makes it better. The problem is that it cost 12 million to make. As a Brit its rare that films like that continue, especially as ITV (UK TV company) payed for most of it, and they are very tight on money!! Also if you read the books, they will require to built a proper man of war if they continue. Let's start funding them!!"
5,Horatio Hornblower- Excellent Movies,"In typical Horatio Hornblower style, these movies are excellent. The acting is great, the scenery is great. We watch these movies over and over with our family and don't have to worry about inappropriate words or scenes. HIGHLY Recommended."
5,AWARDS MUST BE FORTHCOMING!,"This is simply the best show I have ever seen on T.V. Emmy awards, Cable ACE awards MUST be forthcoming (especially for Robert Lindsay's perfect, brilliant performance as Capt. Pellew!) Bravos also to the director, producer and what must have been a marvelous crew to have produced this masterpiece!"
5,Very Well Done,A&E did a wonderful job of capturing the Hornblower characters. The only bad thing I have to say is that they should have done the whole saga as a one or two year television series. I hope they make more in the future.
4,Excellent Realization of Hornblower Books,Hronblower fans will love this television adaptation of Mr. Midshipment Hornblower and Lieutenant Hronblower. The episodes progress throught the series of short stories that make up these two books.The actors are well cast and do an excellent job. Both the actor who plays Hornblower and especially the actor playing Capt. Sir Edward Pellow are excellent.The costumes and scenary are very well done and overall it is well directed and well produced.A must see for Hornblower fans.
5,Another great set...Keep them coming...,This is another great set of movies. I hope that the decide to continue the series. I would highly recomend this and Sharpe's for any that like the historical type of movies.
5,Ioan did a great job on this,Ioan played a great Horatio Hornblower! I think it's the best mini-series I have ever seen! They did a wonderfull job! I give it 5-stars!
5,A new standard for the made for TV movie.,"It has been many years since I read the Hornblower books. This series has captured the thrilling adventures in ""Midshipman Hornblower"" and proves that great literature CAN be translated to the motion picture medium. Absolutely a must see for anyone with a taste for great swashbuckling adventure."
5,A reason to love history!!,"Hip, hip, huzzah! Hip, hip, huzzah! Hip, hip, huzzah! Three cheers for Horatio Hornblower!! As a historical reenactor, I was so pleased to see the details to costume, voice, and manners!! This A&E series is a refreshing ocean breeze. I was swept away and long to go to sea now (although women could not at that time)! Gruffud and Lindsay were a wonderful team and A&E should consider another series of episodes soon!"
2,"Gigantic fan of PUFFY, but....","...well, this is their worst outing, even their cover album is better and that is not saying much. The singing is tired and the songwriting is uninspired. This one isn`t fun to listen to at all!What saves this album are the three songs by Andy Sturmer. He would go on to helm `Nice`, PUFFY`s next album and my favorite of theirs. I recommend `Nice` a million times over `Spike`, and it`s cheaper anyways."
4,Good,Product was good; the cover did what is was supposed to do and is quite pretty. Overall a good buying experience.
2,My Bad,Dropped it after a week of use and cracked the lid.. OH WELL.. Good thing I bought two covers so I'm using the other one.-_-
3,With snap on cover doesn't fit in belt clip/holster,"Purchased this item for my Razor to change the color. It snaps on nice and tight but no longer fits in my Verizon holster to clip onto my belt, wish I would had known this, I would had purchased a rubber case instead of the hard snap on case then it possibly would had been thinner to fit in clip. So far (only had couple days) case is a nice protector as others have noted."
3,Where Do I Go From Here?,"This would be Horace's final contemporaneous release and it's a good one. Unlike the previous few, he wraps himself in the arms of young players (like Kisor and Greene). I bet the sessions were loose and fun.Songs are good if a little formulaic. Silver's piano playing reflects his arthritic ills but I'm not complaining. I missed the McBride tribute recently out in LA but did see some YouTube footage of Horace (with Cybil Shepard (?). Horace keeps chuggin'. They broke the mold, baby."
4,My dog has a blast with this,"My dog loves lambswool toys, and this one has 2 squeakers! I purchased this at my local pet store, but it's the same toy. She's had it for about a month, and no visible signs of tears (better than most other toys). The only drawback is that I feel the price is a bit high."
4,Portrait of a survivor,"Interesting documentary about jazz icon Anita O'Day, tracing her life and career from her days as a big band singer with Gene Krupa through the glory days of the 1950's and down to the present. Consisting of interviews, reminiscences by friends and colleagues, appreciations by jazz historians and scholars, and lots and lots of vintage clips of her performances, this film paints a fascinating portrait of a singer who was, above all, a survivor. O'Day candidly discusses her tumultuous life, especially her 16-year addiction to heroin.There are some technical glitches in the film--slightly out of focus photography in spots, muddy sound in others--but it is worthwhile and enjoyable nonetheless."
4,Better Than I Expected,"Before seeing this I had actually disliked a couple of Anita's better knownperformances, but I heard and appreciated much more here. Her vocals, especially the modern ones, were uniqueyet still melodic, and appealing. The filmmakers made it too busy visually, with many cuts andembellishments, but her spirited personality--from youth to old age--really came through."
5,way beyond standard veggie fare,"Both of Didi Emmons cookbooks are among my most reliable recipe sources. As someone who's been a vegetarian for years and who also cooks for serious carnivores, I love that I can find recipes that pair ingredients I would not come up with on my own. Favorite recipes in this book include cambodian tomato soup, pomegranate walnut dip (muhammara,) hazelnut mushroom burgers,and chard and eggplant salad."
4,Wonderful classic French cooking,"This is the first cookbook I bought that introduced me to truly amazing food. The wonderful sauces and new ingredients were fantastic to cook and bake. If you like excellent, simple food, this is the book to get."
3,yes and no,"Although i am a great fan of older delerium(with every release i become more disstanced), this is one of the disks i listen to the least. Mostly because the first two tracks fail to do much for me. Mixing exessively industrialesque beats with rediculious samples, they seem like they should have been b-sides off a FLA release. Despite that, this is worth having in any true fans collection, just for the epic track ""Grave Mentor."" This fifteen minute track reminds me of some deeply macabe soundtrack. Slow and methodical. Finishing off the release is the quiet ""Sorrow"" it's a herald of dreams. Play the second half before sleep, and you will drift to an interesting place.If you enjoy this, i would suggest looking up ""Stone Glass Steel"" or possibly even ""Ambre"""
3,background music for an afternoon with friends,Paddy Fahy's Jig was a favorite of mine with its eerie fiddle and guitar. As a whole the CD flows so well that one barely notices the transitions and even the silence when the last track has been played. A fine acoustic collection of energetic as well as melancholy Irish music.
5,Puffy Remixes Rock!,"Puffy Remixes (License to Skill). This is their first remixes album and it's really really good! It's a blend of club music, and other great beats. If you like the Puffy jet cd, then you will love this cd. i definitely recommend it! There are 13 tracks each remixed by a different dj. Out of 13 tracks I like about 11-12. That's really good if you think about it."
4,There is a problem,There is no cd with the Kindle version. The author refers to the cd in every chapter and does limit the value. Although I have a book version without the cd. The material is well presented.
2,Errors and discrepancies,"I did not get far before I began to notice many discrepancies between the written pronunciation keys and the pronunciation on the audio CD. Most of the differences are syllable stress, but I also noticed a few vowel and consonant errors. It looks like a good teaching approach for adult English speakers, so it's a shame the editing and basic proofreading is so poor. Example: Vater is given as FAH-tuh on one page, VAH-tuh on the written word list on the following page, and FAH-tuh (or more like FAH-tuhr) on the audio CD. I don't want to guess all the way through which pronunciation is correct, so I'm returning this."
2,"the book is not totally worthless, but almost","it is an outline of German Grammar, and while not totally worthless, it is nearly so. Don't waste your money on this one."
2,Arrived on time but dirty,"I purchased this book to supplement my German lessons and was disappointed with the cover of the book. There are multiple mug marks on the cover as if it was used as a coaster for someone's morning coffee and was stained with other unrecognizable substances. The pages of the book are fine, but I found the condition of this item to be unprofessional. I would not buy from this person again."
4,German Made Interesting & Easy,"I would highly recommend this book for the beginner, who is looking for a great book that explains German, it's pronunciation, culture, etc. It really has made it fun. Also, it has taught me little things about its realtionship to English, historically and liguistically that makes it interesting. Great book for learning German, and enjoy it at the same time!"
4,Worth getting as a starter,"If you wish to learn basic German, this is a good book to help you. There are clear explanations of pronunciation, some good examples of simple phrases and appropriate grammar. It is more up to date than many others.However, it is purely for basic level; those that already do speak some German may not find it that useful. It would also be slightly more helpful if it had an associated CD. It would be better with some more examples of simple every day phrases and perhap some conversational items. I would not suggest using this book on its own, but certainly as part of a structured learning plan and a good starting point.None the less, worth the price."
5,Great place to start,"I'm coming back to German language learning after a long hiatus - about thirty years since High School German. This book is a great place to start; it provides interesting history of the German language, discussion of various parts of speech, and always ties it back to analogous words and phrases in English. There may be more advanced texts available, but this is an excellent starting point."
1,Don't order for kindle,"I ordered this to learn German before our trip. If you buy this for Kindle, you do NOT get the cd with the pronunciation, so it really isn't very useful...not up to the usual Amazon standards."
5,Covers everything you need,Thorough teaching and review. Easy to follow dialogue. A good start to learn the language. Plan to use it and prepare for travel.
2,Not well Organized,"This book has good information, but is not well organized. Other books will build you up to a basic understanding of the language and its structure prior to the nuts and bolts of the language. This book does a little of both in a disorganized way!German Beginners,Skip this book and go for something else."
5,fun workout!,I have this video and it is one of those that is fun to do. It is a good workout too. And Judy knows what she is doing.
4,Sigrid Came Out of Her Shell,"This is the last in the Sigrid Harald Series and I think, the best. Sigrid finally came out of her shell, perked up her appearance and investigated some interesting murder cases with a vengance. Author Margaret Maron's description of her characters are so good, you can can visualize what they look like and you probably know someone who looks like them. The book held my interest until the very end because you get hooked and want to know what happens to everyone. I didn't think I'd like the Sigrid Harald series because I just love the Deborah Knott stories but, with two different locations, north vs. south, enjoyed all of them. And so will anyone who reads them!"
3,"Too little, too late","The Fish really were one of the best bands of the time; the controlled explosion of creativity that was their first four albums would fill two discs with ease (all 4 discs are priceless).Phooey on Vanguard for keeping these ""Visionaries"" so tightly under-wraps - and irritable thanks for releasing ANY of this material, however grudgingly(maybe they'll get smart & release the Martin Mull & Oregon material they're sitting on, too)"
2,Malfunction twice,This product tweeter broke on me twice. Could not get it repaired the second time because the original warranty expired. Was not happy.
1,Fake,"There is no way in hell that these speakers could stand 1200 watts for 3 seconds, let alone all the time."
2,"Lots of noise and lights, but that's about it","This toy looks and sounds like the real thing, but my son became quickly bored with it. It would be nice if the bottom part actually spun around (not at a dangerous speed, but something that looked real). I'm concerned about the durability of this toy. The clear pastic on the bottom tends to get rubbed on the ground. It's already scratched and chipped."
2,not built for a childs play,Broke on 2nd day. It is not very durable for 21/2 year old to play with.
1,"Changes Taste, Still Bad Water","Of all the filters for tap water, PUR is perhaps the best; still, while it removes chlorine and other additives, it doesn't remove fluoride. Fluoride is bad for people with heart problems and is already present in high amounts in most toothpastes. And though it may have some benefit from topical use, fluoride has never shown any benefits from systemic use. Furthermore, the FDA has never approved any fluoride product designed for ingestion as safe or effective. Thus, for people who want to drink only water, PUR still does not quite remove enough. Get this filter if you're concerned mostly with taste, but if you live in a community that's fluoridated, it still won't remove that additive."
4,Good Short Video,"I tried this video for the first time in my 23rd week after having not exercised consistently for several months. I'm not new to yoga but this video was challenging and just the right length. Although I would have enjoyed more ambiance(calming music, interesting scenery), I felt very good and stretched out afterward. Most importantly, I felt like I got my money's worth."
3,just one short workout,"I like the DVD, but thought it would have wished to have more than one short workout on it, for variation. Not much on it, honestly , was it 35 min?"
1,Not Enjoyable at all,"I have many workout videos and bought three for pregnancy. This one I would not recommend. It is not a comfortable enjoyable workout, you are upside down most of the time and when you are pregnant that is not a good position and it makes it hard to enjoy the workout. Also my new DVD came with Sara's voice going at a high rate of speed, it is weird and annoying. I would however, recommend Leisa Hart's Fit Mama prenatal workout for fun salsa dancing cardio and yoga segments as well as stretches and relaxation. And Quick Fix Pre Natal workout, which is three 10 minute workouts, so you can do them anytime, even when you don't have much time or energy!"
4,very relaxing,"This video is great for the morning or when you are a bit tired. I am used to 60m ashtanga yoga so this video was a bit slow and basic for me. However, this video is incredibly relaxing. The birds chirping in the background are peaceful. Sara looks wonderful pregnant. But if you are looking for a little more intensity, I do not suggest this video."
2,Fabulous Music ... Incredibly SHORT CD!,"The music of Perry & Kingsley was ahead of it's time. Created almost entirely on Moog Synthesizer, most of it sounds a little bizarre (but in a good way), some is light hearted, some warm and sweet. But almost all of it is a lot of fun. With one bouncy tune after another, this is great music to crank up very loud while you're doing house work or other projects around the house.The amazing Box Set ""The Out Sound from Way In: The Complete Vanguard Recordings by Perrey & Kingsley (2001)"" contains 58 Tracks (including all 10 of these). Sounds fantastic, and is $10.49 and up right now. So I would recommend getting that one."
5,very cute,"feels nice and soft but not too soft, almost like real fur.Love the long tail, about the size of a small belt."
4,cuby and blizzards will blow your mind,"the songs are great, and the sound is simply amazing. A must have for any true fan!"
4,True Depiction of Satan at Work....,"This book opens up to a small town radio personality, Wes Bryant, with the usual flaws of our society. Divorced, no active family life, alone in an apertment at age 34 and no forseeable future plans.He is quickly thrust into a situation where he witnesses a satanic ritual right in his home town. As the plot unfolds, Wes finds that many people who he sees regularly are involved with a cult that has enveloped his community. His struggle to save a young girl and her mother from abuse makes this story a gripping tale that you won't be able to put down.My hat's off to Mr. Larson. I am not a huge reader, although I am trying to read more these days, but I have never been so compelled by a fictional story before. The author's end note states that the stories in the novel are based on acutal evetns. That is enough to make your blood boil. If you like graphic descriptions and true-to-life horror, pick up this book. I am looing forward to reading its sequal, Abaddon."
1,It's one Star bad but Five-Star entertainment,"Larson is, without a doubt, a hack. He's the Howard Stern of Christian radio, dragging out demons and call-in exorcisms in a desperate hope that someone - ANYONE - will listen. And, to be fair, his show is an entertaining one. He's like a rabid wesal foaming at the mouth over some chewed up gristle. Satanic Abuse is a great subject for people like him because they can always say ""Well there's never been any proof but only because of the HUGE cover-up"" and this book is really just a fictional account of that. It plays on all the outlandish fears of Christians (and non Christians) and, in the end, we all learn a valuable lesson and should be so frightened that we don't think twice about trotting off and donating money to Larson's Ministry. Personally, I thought it was a great read - very funny and just schmaltzy enough. If you're the kind of person who enjoys books that are so bad they're good, then this is a definite must-read."
2,ALL of Bob Larson's books are fiction...,"...this is just the first one that's been marketed as such. Larson's ""expertise"" on the occult is such that even those who share his point of view deride him as a kook. But you must admit, he spins a good, if inconsistent, yarn."
1,BobLarson...Satanist?!?,"After reading the laudatory reviews given by gullible Christians to this hacks books, I am forced to say that Barnum was right. Larson is a clever hustler with a line of patter who has succeeded in enriching himself by scaring a lot of well- meaning Christians. In fact, given all off his sucess in publicizing Satanism, and in making Evangelicals look stupid, one is forced to ask a question. Is it possible that Larson, himself, is a secret member of Laveys Church of Satan? Think about it . To ask a question that the followers of ole scratch are found of asking, Cui Bono? Joseph."
1,Passed the time.,"The book is horrible, the writing was bad, characters were undeveloped, cheesy and simple. Im also one of those who appreciates a bad read from time to time (not sure anyone understands what I mean by that, oh well). Super quick read."
2,Warning,"I thought this book would be a quick-reading suspense. It was a quick read, but it was more horror than suspense. The details in this book are far more graphic than most novels I read that aren't published as Christian fiction. I wouldn't recommend it for anyone who is easily scared or for young people.Other than that, I found a lot of things unbelievable in this novel. For example, the protagonist had things go to smoothly for him overall. (He kidnaps a woman from a hospital and no one stops him; he holds hostages at a radio station and no one arrests him.) Even the events that don't relate to cult members don't seem true to life.If you're interested in story lines featuring Satanic cults, you might like it. Otherwise, I'd steer clear."
1,"Some have called it ""Christian pornography.""","This book was pulled from the shelves in a number of Christian bookstores in Ohio. As a result, former Bob-backer, Margo Hamilton called and pleaded with one manager to not pull the book. His response: ""It is shameful for us to discuss what the evil do in private,"" (Eph. 5), let alone provide graphic descriptions of Mr. Larson's imagination; although he claims the book is based on alleged fact."" Needless to say, the book is still off of the shelves. If you're looking for horror, stick with Stephen King. If you're looking for Christian novels, try Peretti. If you're looking for theologically sound literature, stay away from Larson."
1,"Blather, pure blather","This book is shallow. Sure, it is an easy read, but I am not sure if I want to continue wasting my time. I am glad I borrowed it, and so happy I did not buy it.I am currently on page 122 (of 379), and there are numerous typos; very frustrating. On the second page of chapter one, the character is called West. I had to go back to the first page to read the names of the newly introduced characters to comprehend who this new character was. Oh, not a new character, but Wes spelled incorrectly. Again, very frustrating to read this book."
