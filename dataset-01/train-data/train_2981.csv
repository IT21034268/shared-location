4,The mistake was mine!,"When I decided to purchase this product, I thought the price was for four pieces, i.e. front and rear, but no, only the front mats were considered. Expensive as they were, I had them sent to my address in Miami for their forwarding to Chile, my home country; as a result, I ended paying almost $ 300,- for freight and taxes, reason being that they were boxed in a container the size of myself, almost! (not the seller's fault but my fowarder's). In any case, the mats are very high quality and I'm sure thy will last as long as the car."
1,Perfect film for a sadist...,This movie is cruel and sadist in its story and I just can't fathom why any normal person would enjoy viewing it... :-(
3,Product not what is pictured but similar,"The dress is not what is pictured, the dress is not shinny like what is pictured but is a stronger material. But, for it being a queen it really needed to be shinny to show wealth."
3,Mixed Feelings-,"I really wanted to like this book- the pictures and captions are excellent, and there isn't too much out there dealing with this important early jet. The problem is the terrible, turgid, unnecessary text. I really don't need to read an entire paragraph about what air division a given ADC wing was attached to, or who the commanders were. That isn't part of the operational history of the Thunderjet/streak/flash family. Added to the poor writing is the atrocious editing and typos common to many of Schiffer Publishing's books. All in all, I'm glad I bought it, but it is for looking at, not reading."
4,Lots of informations in a no-frills package,"This book is really packed with information about the F-84 family, I found particularly well documented the section dealing with the early use of the straight wing variants,as no other book provides this aspect of the thunderjet's career.On the minus side, the section about the use of F/RF-84 in the Italian air force is loaded with typos (none of the 20 or so Italian words is spelled correctly), but this doesn't subtract too much to the value of the book. In my opinion the ultimate reference book on the F/RF-84."
2,Not as advertised,"I ordered this item as a gift. Our friend appreciated receiving the book and acknowledged receipt with a thank you, but added the comment that it was not new. This was particularly disappointing, I was a little embarrassed to have sent a used gift."
1,Not even a good starter camera,"I have disliked this camera from the moment I first used it. Unfortunately I didn't do any research before buying it, I bought it spontaneously at WalMart for about $150. It eats up the batteries really fast, if the batteries aren't brand new, forget getting any kind of decent picture if the lighting isn't perfect. I am going to sell this thing on ebay for whatever I can get out of it. If somebody offers me a dollar, I'll take it. I would like to say that this is a great starter camera, but I am sure there are cameras out there on the market for the same price, or cheaper, that take better pics and don't eat batteries."
3,decent,"Took pictures and never broke on me, but the batteries are ridiculous. As noted, they are spent quickly. Also the pictures ALWAYS turn out fuzzy and blurry, maybe I am doing something wrong but the quality is very poor. Color and focus are frequently messed up as well. Does take video fine and zoom works well, just not great quality. I am upgrading to a better camera that actually takes a picture instead of a blur."
3,Nice,Had no idea the difficulty it would take two people to pull and tug then staple on. It's nice quality but a little difficult to assemble
2,Just plain boring,"I really tried to like this album, but it just wasn't possible. The lyrics are decent, but that's about it. This is acoustic goth music, basically. I have heard it called neo-folk, but why? Most of the songs lull about with the same structure : acoustic guitars; soft, almost spoken, vocals; and various bells and whistles (literally) in the background. Some of the songs are just instrumentals, but they are all pretty boring. The haunting elements of this album intrigued me at first, but the disc is just too monotonous. By track 4 or 5 you'll find yourself really wanting to turn it off. Go with that urge, it doesn't change at all throughout the album."
5,Love this Desk Pad,"I am very pleased with this purchase; great price, great product. It looks wonderful on my desk and I love it!"
5,Stunning,Well made and looks fabulous. This is a great choice for the money. I like that the felt protects my wood desk.
1,Horrible Desk Pad,I received this desk pad in a very timely fashion because amazon shipping is amazing. The first problem was the packaging. It was in a thin box that was packaged inside another thin box. I received it damaged. The pad is also very thick compared to other desk pads and the felt bottom just allows it to slide around like a hockey puck.The same time that I ordered this I also ordered a Rhinolin desk pad. I would recommend looking into the Rhinolin desk pad before even considering buying this.
1,Damaged,"The package came on time, but was damaged. Sent an inquiry on instructions for return or replacement. Have had no reply. Big dent and tear in the box and also a tear on the black top surface of the pad. Think it will served me well if I can get one that doesn't have a tear down to the backing. Would like to hear from someone on this."
2,its ok,nothing special i would recommend spending more money on the other desk mats this thing is kind of weak looking
3,Desk Pad,"The item arrived quickly and was packaged well. Overall it looks nice on my desk, though a bit bigger than I expected so am trying to find a different desk for it. The only thing I noticed was that some of the leather cover is coming unglued."
1,Desk pad,This is not what I thought it was. To heavy and all I wanted was a blotter not a wood desk pad.
2,"Good Product, bad packaging","I should have read the reviews. Received it damaged in a corner and the wood was broken. Otherwise it would have been a very nice pad. Packaging was no more than a tightly fit cardboard box, easily damaged by droping or placing heavy boxes on it. Box used has no foam padding or similar."
3,Protects desk well,"I have a very nice wood desk and my goal was to find a pad that would not only look nice but also not damage fine wood. This pad fits both requirements. However, the one negative is that it came ""bowed"" in the center so sits on the desk oddly. I am placing large books on it to see if it flattens. I don't think this was from the manufacturer, but probably a large item was placed on the center of the pad during shipping. I would recommend this item for those not wanting to spend a fortune but desire a very nice, quality item. I have never been disappointed in Rolodex products."
5,Great!,"Wow! I was so taken by Phoebe Snow belting out an old favorite as only she can. Missed U! Come back Phoebe, been a long time"
1,Inland Lakes North Central,I was not able to evaluate as the data card did not fit my Garmin Etrex Vista. When purchasing there was no way to check compatibility. Some where in the advertisement it should be define what device the software will work with.
2,Ok but SLOW,"This is a VERY, VERY, VERY slow machine for coping. The copy speed is 1.2 cpm for color and 2.5 cpm for b/w. I would rather pay more to get another brand of Print/Copy/Scan/Fax if I knew the speed performance before I bought it. If you don't need the fax function, there are some other cheaper machines that work faster than this one."
2,Disgusted with Sharp...Great if you do not install XP!,"I have been quite happy with this machine since I purchased it in August of 2001. It wasn't until I upgraded to Microsoft XP that I had difficulty. You see, the AJ-5030 is not compatible with the new Windows operating system. I have spent oodles of time trying to find a patch on both the Sharp and Microsoft websites to no avail. An email describing my problem sent to tech support at Sharp was replied to with the following statement: Sorry it is not compatible! I wish I had known I would be buying a machine that I could only use for a few months. OPne would think that Sharp would back up their product either with a software fix or a rebate. Looks like it's back to HP or Lexmark for me."
2,"Ok Printer, but...","I have had this printer for 3 years. My biggest complaint is the price of the ink cartridges. It cost me about 80-90 dollars to replace both the color and b&w cartridges. For that reason alone, I would recommend not buying this printer."
2,AJ-5030 NOT a bargain,"The company promo said it was ""easy to use"" they forgot to tell about the set up being complicated not to mention the software not being everything I would need to scan and manipulate documents. I still have yet to get the ReadIris to work right. I have had this Sharp all in one for about 4 months and definitely have buyers remorse! The ink cartridges are VERY hard to find and they are VERY expensive at $95.00 for both. They run out of ink very fast. Since the only source is on-line, it makes you wonder what will happen when it breaks down. This is a fairly slow machine for coping. The copy speed is 1.2 cpm for color and 2.5 cpm for b/w. I would not do it again."
3,tried kicking it up a notch...,".... but kinda got a kick in the pants.Saw a show recently that pretty much rocked every fiber in my soul... and this album channelled maybe like, 2 fibers... and they rubbed together and sort of srtated a fire... but then it went out really quick... and was rather downtempo... and vaguely dirty/ambient...We got mad talent here... just not so much on this particular album."
3,Yummy bass,"Hip Hop tempos and heavy beats. This album will literally force your body to start moving. Doesn't particularly stand out among Bassnectar's other albums, but it's still a good listen. Not to mention they are playing Wakarusa this year, which will be an amazing festival."
3,better with each listen,"i got this originally for the song ""yo"" it wasn't the version i wanted but as i listened to the rest of the cd i found myself enjoying it and its become better with each listening."
3,No pictures,"It's important to notice that only first 20 cards have images ( not very clear images i must say ), other cards have only number on them ( 1-50 ). The quality of cards is very good."
4,nay sayers step the f##k back,"To all of those who think big aesop rock is on a downward spiral in terms of quality, you need to snap out that nightmare. Ace Rizzle is still large and in charge on his latest album. Granted it's not as good as releases such as Labor Days, Float, etc, BUT IT BY NO MEANS SUCKS!! His lyrics are still poingnant, and the beats enhance the feeling of the songs nicely. Some may disagree that this album kicks a$$, but then again some people think Carrot Top is funny so check it out for yourself. Also i recently had the EXTREME pleasure of seeing Aesop in concert and the mofo tore it up. Also a brand new, unreleased, UNTITLED, song was played before he took the stage and it F**KING RULED. Bottom line, if you're an aesop rock fan check out Fast Cars, if you're just getting into him, maybe start with Float or Labor Days. Well it appears the chubby debutante has mastered the high note, so peace"
2,AESOP HAS GONE MAD!,"I HAVE BEEN A FAN OF AESOP EVER SINCE I FIRST HEARD HIS MUSIC A COUPLE YEARS AGO. THE THING THAT GOT ME WAS HIS BEATS, WHICH I LOVE, ESPECIALLY THE ONES ON FLOAT. I ALSO LIKE HIS LYRICS, BECAUSE I HAVE TO LISTEN TO A SONG OVER 20 TIMES TO EVEN GET THE SLIGHTEST CLUE ABOUT WHAT HES TALKING ABOUT. SOME PEOPLE DONT LIKE THIS, AND JUST SAY AESOP ROCK'S LYRICS DONT MAKE ANY SENSE, BUT I LIKE THEM.I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED WHEN I BOUGHT THIS ALBUM. THE PRODUCTION IS HORRIBLE. PERIOD. ITS MIGHT DIFFERENT, A NEW STYLE, WHATEVER YOU WANT TO CALL IT, BUT ITS STILL BAD. AND THE LYRICS ARE NOT NEARLY AS GOOD AS THEY USED TO BE. I HOPE HE MAKES UP FOR THIS POOR RELEASE ON HIS NEXT CD."
5,Perhaps the reason why there is only one Ween tribute CD,"This CD is short, but the covers are great! The sound is spot-on, but the female vocals and acoustic guitars add a unique flavor to the mix w/o debasing the pure Ween soul. The CD also serves as a snapshot of Ween before they ""made it big"" with CDs like Chocolate and Cheese. Great for new Ween heads and old fans alike and a must-have for the completist."
5,Witty,"I found the stories to be witty, well-written and thought provoking. Some of subject matters make the reader uncomfortable, but the author handles them well. The stories are detailed and yet concise. This book was a good read!"
1,"Hope for aspiring authors, no matter how bad","Let all aspiring authors rejoice: if Ms. Goldner can get published, you certainly can too!The positive reviews here are clearly friends and family of the author because anyone who has ever read another printed word from any source would never consider this drivel worthy of publication. This material deserved less than a passing thought, and the author chose to (I use this term loosely) 'develop' it into a short story collection. She's either independently wealthy and this is an expression of vanity, or she's seriously delusional and should seek help immediately. Either way, save your money."
2,,I got on a short story kick after reading Jhumpa Lahari. This definitely is not of that calibar. Better luck next time.
1,Buy this one.,"I read this book and thought it was terrible. Perhaps credit can be given for a first attempt at a published collection, but despite how bad this book was I urge anyone with a few extra dollars to buy it. Any author who has to sink so low to get ideas for writing is in obvious desparate need of both attention and validation. By purchasing her book you may help build her confidence to go beyond sanctimonious biography and into the real realms of fiction. Yeah it's a bad read, but think of it as a charitable gift to the starving and desparate arts community."
5,A collection of intense and powerful images,"Winner of the 2002 Morse Poetry Prize, All The Blood Tethers is a collection of intense and powerful images crafted by the award-winning poet Catherine Sasanov illustrating and evoking the severe side of Roman Catholicism, life in the brutal city, wandering past veils of death, and so much more. ""Walk into the patio. / Look up at the stars. / No one's left / to decipher God's language / held just out of reach. / The royal cosmographers / died centuries ago."""
3,needs a joystick,Great classic game but it needs a joystick to be better. Its hard to move as well as you need to. The classic arcade machine is more fun.
4,Good to spike up your soup,"I like to put a few drops of this to my soup, to spike it up a little bit just enough to tickle my appetite. It is made up of soybean oil, sesame oil, chili peppers, and some other ingredients. There are actually pieces of peppers and seeds 1/4 at the bottom of the bottle.Nice dip for dimsums, chow meins, or other food that you want add some extra kick. I like the slightly different taste of this oil based chili sauce when I get tired of the taste of water based Tabasco or Sriracha. Same oil-based chili dip you see on the table of most Chinese restaurants."
2,For Diehards Only,"The artwork is as usual excellent, but that's hardly a reason to buy this c.d., released due to ""demand"". The music is actually ambient sounds and sequences written by TD, and played before concerts. Any song you latch onto is over before you know it. Tangerine Dream is worth a listen, but start somewhere else."
1,Last TD album I buy!!!,The disclaimer inside the CD explains that this is the ambient music used for pre-show atmosphere. It's nothing but animal samples and non-structured random sounds. Supposedly they produced this album in response to fan request. Seems TD is packaging every snip of music (good or bad) and getting it out to market. My major complaint with the album is that they should have put the information about the source of the music on the outside of the album.
2,huh?,"Be very careful with this one.. You might want to hear it before you run out and buy it. Lots of screeching mokeys on this, not alot of music. It is still kind of interesting in terms of the sounds used in it..but remember, it's called AMBIENT. great for playing quietly in the background but not one to throw in the cd player while driving...This stuff reminds me of something Frank Zappa would have done..Good luck.."
2,For diehard TD fans only,"Strange, almost incoherent mix of TD's usual layered electronica and ambient nature and animal sounds. There's some of the expected TD sound, and the music isn't bad, but the animal noises are just too much to overcome. Might be good as background music at the zoo. A real disappointment from the usually reliable Edgar and Jerome."
1,I can't believe I listened to the whole thing.,"I just got this, and it's THE worst TD album I've not only bought, but listened to. I have nearly 100 of their albums, and I'm not willing to stick this one on the hard drive. I can find absolutely no redeaming value to this cacaphony of jungle noises that simply grate on the ears, making the music not only unlistenable, but inaudible. With over 1000 albums to their credit throughout their 45 year tenure, one can understand how one could get away from them and wind up on the shelves instead of the waste basket."
5,A FUN AND INTERESTING READ,"I did not really know what to expect when I purchased this book. I was intrigued by the title and also have found Tappings' books insightful and very practical. He did himself one better with this one. This book provided me with the perspective of Lean and continuous improvement that I had lost. The story flowed fairly well, the illustrations were excellent, and I kept reading because I enjoyed Jim Dandy's antecdotes throughout. Not to give it away, but 2/3 through the story ""an answer"" to the entire book is revealed. Well worth the purchase!"
5,"Excerpt from Parabola review, Fall 1999","The Knowing Heart draws a sweeping picture of the Sufi way, covering such topics as the structure of the spiritual path, the centrality of love, Sufi psychology, the importance of spiritual friendship and community, spiritual faculties, and the sources of the Sufi tradition. Clearly the fruit of personal, heartfelt experience, Helminski's work is a refreshing addition to a body of literature that all too often neglects the profound role that tradition plays in Sufism. He accomplishes this task without subverting either tradition or the needs of his audience. In marked contrast to the ""pick-and-choose"" spirituality that seems so popular nowadays, The Knowing Heart speaks from the heart, yet a heart humbled and submissive to the sources which enliven it."
5,"Library Journal, May 1, 1999","Sufism, which has been described as the mystic heart of Islam, is little known and little understood in this country despite the advocacy of popularizers such as Idries Shah. Helminski, a Mevlevi Shaikh and translator of the great Sufi poet Rumi, offers a clear and well-grounded introduction to Sufism, liberally seasoned with insights from the Koran and the writings of Rumi; his is perhaps the best beginner's guide now available. For most libraries."
5,Insights relevant to modern life,"The Knowing Heart: A Sufi Path Of Transformation presents the Sufi way as a practical spirituality suitable for all cultures and times as Kabir Helminski offers insights relevant to life in today's modern, technology oriented, rapidly evolving, fast-paced and complex world. In cultivating a ""knowing heart"" the reader will learn to experience a renewed sense of self, transform his or her relationships, enhance creative capacity, and learn to meet the spiritual challenges so pervasive to our time. The Knowing Heart is enthusiastically recommended for students of Eastern philosopher in general, and the Sufi belief system in particular."
4,Nice pictures......but,"The pictures alone in this book make it an essential purchase for the daylily fancier. I would have given it five stars except there was no mention of Stamile's Candies, which have won the last two Stout Silver Medals. Also, I found the author tended to mention only good points of a plant and not bad ones such as poor bud counts. People buying this book want to know all about a plant so that they can make an informed judgement if they are considering buying the plant."
4,Magnificent miniatures,"The second book from Graeme Grosvenor on daylilies. A very good book on daylilies; what makes this one is the photography. I think I have read all the books ever written on the daylily, but I have never come across such beautiful photographs,especially of the miniature cultivars which are usually somewhat neglected. What is more the daylilies depicted are instantly recognisable as the flowers that grow in my garden. This book is thorough in content and will do much to get more people hooked on this beautiful and utterly enchanting perennial."
3,"Not a Hendrix imitation, but a fine tribute","Four lengthy interpretations of Hendrix tunes by a relaxed trio of John Abercrombie, Lonnie Smith, and Marvin Smith--this second effort by the trio lags behind their first, less atmospheric effort. Abercrombie retains his identity while spooling out tasty lines of dissonance and happy threads of jazzy melody. But it is Smith who most impresses, pulverizing with abrupt keyboard washes from Mars, while still maintaining a groove and a direction."
1,"GIVE ME A BREAK. , AND ONCE AGAIN NOOOOO STARS?","I GUESS AT THIS POINT THE GREAT POPULARITY OF JIMI HENDRIX, THIRTY YEARS AFTER THE FACT, IS NOW SUBJECT TO ANYONE THAT WANTS TO RECORD AND USE HIS GREATNESS TO DECIEVE MUSIC LOVERS. I GUESS JOE PESCHI IS NEXT IN LINE!"
3,"Dated, but useful","I wanted to get a grip on the rates, but the book seemed to be light on the subject and seemed dated."
3,Inoculation,"I use this book to get Rand into a course I teach at my high school on utopias in Western thought. It's helpful not only because it's a good introduction with well chosen selections from some very long and often tedious fictions, but also because it can serve as an inoculation for my young students against a virulent virus -- the Randism that seems every year to attract more examples of prominent and proliferating American types like the philosophical yahoo, the half-educated techno-nerd, the philistine go-getter, and the evangelistic anti-Christian bigot. They read it with Thomas More (Utopia), Karel Capek (R.U.R.) and Paul Auster (In the Country of Last Things). You can, too."
4,Old dude plays old songs in old New York...but sounds great!,"Alto saxophone legend Benny Carter was 88 years old when he laid down these tracks in 1995 at the Iridium Jazz Club in Manhattan, near Lincoln Center. Coincidentally, he grew up in the same neighborhood. It is a lovely CD, a bit more than an hour long, and Carter was accompanied by piano, bass and drums. It is amazing that he had the stamina at that age to play so long and so well. There is nothing on the disc that long-time fans haven't heard before, but the glory of jazz is that every single performance is ""new"" and ""unique"" in some sense. My favorites here are ""Secret Love"" and ""Just in Time"" but actually, it is all good. The cover photo of the late and lamented Twin Towers is a lovely one, and the music inside is mellow and melodic."
4,The world's most beautiful seashells,"Great book for shell collectors, beautiful pictures and in depth description of a huge number of shells - wonderful coffee table book!"
2,"I'm usually very pleased with St. Ives products, ...","I'm usually very pleased with St. Ives products, but I was disappointed after trying this body wash. I don't care for its vanilla fragrance -- the scent is more like coconut to me. The label emphasizes its aromatherapeutic qualities and it's ultra-moisturizing formula, both of which I was not impressed with. I didn't find this body wash to be any more moisturizing than most others I've tried. I wouldn't recommend this product to my family or friends."
5,This soap is a great value for the ...,"This soap is a great value for the price. It's a very creamy soap that lathers up very well so you don't need a lot of it. Most importantly, it rinses off very easily. My skin feels smooth after using this soap. It leaves my skin smelling like vanilla and not dried out. I'd definitely recommend this soap, unless you don't like the smell of vanilla."
5,This is a must-have body wash! It smells ...,This is a must-have body wash! It smells great and leaves my skin soft and clean. It doesn't leave a residue on my skin like some similar products. I also tried using it as a bubble bath and it was great as well -- lots of good smelling bubbles!
4,I enjoyed my experience with St. Ives Vanilla ...,"I enjoyed my experience with St. Ives Vanilla Body Wash. My skin was left softer, moister, and gently clean. I love the vanilla fragrance that lingers long after you're through bathing. I'd prefer it if the container sat upright and poured from the top, rather than from the bottom -- it'd be easier to control the amount I'm using. I'd recommend it to family and friends."
2,Preschool Computer Lab Teacher - OK for 4-5's,"I have taught preschool computer lab for two years and have attempted to use this software several times with my 4-5 year old students. Because a lot of this software requires reading skills, most of my students have real difficulty playing it. The older students who can manage to play it seem to get bored of it quickly.Overall, I think the software is too complex for young preschoolers, which unfortunately is Blue's Clues primary audience. My 3 year old son was very excited to see this game, but he really can't play it alone - he needs lots of assistance.Ultimately, I don't use this software often in my computer lab because the kids just don't seem to respond to it."
1,Not good.,"I wasted enough time watching this DVD, so I don't want to waste any of your time by writing a long winded review, I'll make it short. This DVD is un-entertaining and unfunny. I am a fan of the Show as well, so I'm not too sure what happened with the DVD. Also, anyone looking for the uncensored experience that you can't get on TV (read: nudity), look elsewhere. What little bit there is on here, is censored.PS: I think the other reviews must be planted."
5,amazing solar system,Purchased to go along with telescope. Wasn't aware at the time that this would go along with projects they are doing in school. This is a hit with me.
3,ehh.,"Being a nerd, I was sure my 6-y/o would love this, since he wanted ""space stuff."" He never got into it. I forgot he had it until I saw it on the ""review your amazon purchase"" page."
4,prefer individual colors,This powder is a little faded/sweat affected by end of day but has reasonable staying power for the price. Liked two of the four colors. Would much prefer they sell the colors individually (maybe they can recommend complementing color groups but you aren't stuck wasting those you hate.)
3,gift for my friends,"My friend asked me to buy it for her. I don't know it is better or worse, but I have not got any bad news from my friends. Maybe it's not too bad."
5,Wanted to share my awesome review,"So I got this in NYC sometime before I moved to TX. Never really used it much till recently.. Someone, I forget who, told me how u can just wet the dry eye shadow to give it a wet look. Works WONDERFULLY and easy to apply. I own diff color set..back grey dark blue silver. I usually just use the black. Wetting the brush before applying really does the trick and I love it.Recently some teenage girls at the pool told me about elf eye product. Checked out the reviews on it but it seems like it doesn't stay on! U would need to reapply an hour later. That sucks. With this that doesn't happen. I almost never need to reapply my makeup, let alone this eye shadow!!! Awesome!"
4,professional scamming,"The product was not the issue here. It was definitely the item I wanted. It was offered at a great price. I never write reviews, but feel this one is warranted. It was not disclosed that $4.99 is charged for every $1.75 item. And to add insult to injury, they tax you on the shipping charges as well! Definitely fleeced!!"
4,Great eyeshadow quad,"I really like this eyeshadow quad. The first colour is a matte light cream colour. The second is a kind of matte greyish taupe, the third is a shimmery copper brown and the last is a matte dark brown. The two lightest colours are alright; they are nice colours in the box but they aren't very pigmented on your eyes. The shimmery copper is beautiful but my favourite is the dark brown which is matte. The eyeshadow quad is pretty foolproof. I find myself using this everyday even though the pigmentation for the top two eyeshadows is so-so."
5,Revlon ColorStay Eye Shadow,I was very upset when I found out that Revlon was not sending out this product in the Wine colors to stores anymore. I ordered 6 of these and they came in 3 days. The items were sealed and exactly what I can't get in stores anymore. If this is the color you also like stock up. This was a good buy!
5,Handy cart,This cart is a replacement for another similar cart. The other was a different brand. All the ball bearings came out of the wheels on the old one. This one seems a little sturdier. It certainly is a very versitile cart.
4,I had fun watching the kids,"Candle runs down quick, but it was priceless watching my son try to blow out the candles and watching all the kids laughing when it came back on again. Too bad I can't pull that trick twice."
5,Very detailed photos,"If you live or used to live somewhere in the New York area, you might have a grim desire for a book that shows exactly how the WTC attacks affected specific shops, buildings, blocks, etc. that you knew and loved, not just how terrible the effects were in general.The NYPD book shows how the attacks affected the little sailboats in the marinas near the WTC, what the attacks did to the daycare center, what the ""bad side"" of the Winter Garden looked like, etc."
5,"Remember the Alamo, Remember Pearl Harbor, Remember 9/11","Time has washed away many of the emotions we all felt on 9/11. This book brings much of that back and well it should. Americans seem to have a short attention span, perhaps because we don't have the movies that portrayed the enemies of this country and the brave men who were fighting against them. We were all patriotic during World War II and hopefully this book will bring some people back to the reality of what happened that terrible day in 2001."
4,"Great shipping, product B+",Product is okay - strips too easily on casings so falls off before it's time and has to be replaced. Plus water drains very SLOWLY and takes forever to get one glass of water. But water tastes good and filter clearly works.
5,"Great product, great service","Great filters, have used these for a couple years! Additionally the services through Amazon and FiltersFast was wonderful! We recommend this service!"
4,Disappointed about Discontinuation,This system worked great for me. The other Brita systems kept leaking or breaking. I will now have to find a non-Brita system from somewhere.
2,cost way too much!! get the Caullagan at a quarter of the cost,cost too much and dont last that long!! the Caullagen system only cost about $17 to start and about $7 for a replacement filter that lasts 3 monthes
5,Great customer Service,My order was lost in route to me twice. Customer service was of great assistance. I have been a customer of Amazon.com for quite awhile and I am still very pleased with their service.
5,Really works - really difference,"Good product, here in Chicago we can really taste difference with or without a filter."
4,Water Tastes better,I have been using brita Aqua for over a year now.....It does make a difference in the taste of water...The only reason it gets four stars instead of five is because sensor on aquaview turns red (Warning that the filter has gone bad) at least a month in advance
4,"It could last longer, but works well","This is probably the best on faucet filter we've owned. The claim is that the filters last up to three months. We get closer to two months. A bit pricey, but the water does taste quite good."
4,Superb edition of Celtic saint hagiography,"Like all Penguin classics, this is a scholarly but accessible edition of an ancient and enduring work. It includes an excellent introduction by Richard Sharpe, a fellow of Wadham College, Oxford, and an extensive bibliography. A must-read for anyone interested in the Celtic church fathers, and those seeking insight into the very special spirituality of Celtic Christianity."
3,Where is Adomnan?,"A sweeping tapestry of the life and times, historically evocative and informative, but little available on Adomnan."
1,"Griff sucks, EBay sucks .. should never buy this book!","This ""Griff"" guy sucks! I wouldn't listen to anything he has to say. Check out EBay boards to find out what he is all about. His nose is so brown, it makes me sick.No one should pay money to read anything that fat slob says!"
2,"OK, but not great - there are better eBay books out there","For something that bills itself as the Bible, totally comprehensive, and everything you need to know, this book left me feeling a little left out. It doesn't offer enough coverage on the topics I really want to know about (getting the best price for my items, trusting your buyer and seller) and too much on areas that are pretty self explantory (seller rankings for one). The tone of the book is lacking as well, with a dry, almost hokey presenation. I found myself talking back to the book at times, in frustration. All in all, this is not the best eBay book out there - eBay The Smart Way or one of the EBay dummies books get that nod."
1,"If you can turn on your computer, you don't need this!","How can you sign onto your computer and not be able to follow the menu driven eBay sign up and sell stuff on the web site? You really need to look at a book that is showing you the same thing that's on your screen? Believe me all eBay wants to do is get sellers on, so they can sell, so eBay can grab a share of the profit.This book is really a bunch of dribble about how great eBay is and how it changes your life. No metion of eBay supporting the sellers only; no buyer protection, and eBay's total lack of care about fraud and no buying customer support. Is this snake oil salesman getting a kickback from eBay!?But this book will change ""Griff's"" life...cause there is a sucker born every nanosecond. Like the bloated shipping and handling fees on eBay, you'll get nothing for something with this pile of pulp."
1,The Official ebay Bible by Jim Griffith,"The word ""bible"" denotes an ""authoritative"" guide....this book, unfortunately, is anything but. Rather, it is a highly opinionated rant about how things should be done on Ebay, according to Jim Griffith. It is sad when an ebay employee who doesn't understand the buying, selling, and feedback problems of the ordinary ebayer writes an ""Official"" guide. This should have been called an ""Unofficial Opinion"". The small disclaimer stating that it is only opinion does nothing to sway the perception that this IS the authoritative guide to ebay. Instead of this drivel, ebay should have taken the time to ask REAL buyers and sellers for input. As it is, they simply let Griff rant, then stamped it with their seal of approval. Anything to make a buck, I guess. This book is a major disappointment."
1,Public Relations Fluff Piece,The book is little more than a one-sided publicity fluff piece to snag new fee-paying customers with a promise of an easy path to the good life. The book does not address any of the problems which many ebay sellers that I know have encountered when dealing with this company.
1,"Quite disappointed, get a different cajon!","I had been searching for a cajon for a while and heard good things about this one. I was already familiar with the meinl brand so I was expecting a fairly good quality product. Upon receiving the item I inspected it inside and out. On the inside the construction seemed extremely sloppy, there were pieces just kinda stuck wherever, glue was literally splattered all over the inside like they threw it together in two minutes.After inspection I sat down and played some beats.. It was at this point where I totally regretted making this purchase.. I have played many cajons before but none have sounded this cheap.. the ""snap"" of the snare is terribly no matter which way you adjust it! It just sounds like a terrible awful buzz, not at all like it should... I would go with literally ANY other Cajon if you're looking to buy one."
5,excellent music,i got to see the rekooperaters in a small club in boston actually twice in 2months.the electricity jimmy generated was one of the finest live performances ive seen in quite a long time.being a boomer ive heard some of the best and jimmy qualifies.this is a must cd and kudoos to al kooper and the band.i rate this a 9.
4,Jimmy V...,Jimmy is one of the most versitile guitar players on the scene today. We'll miss him here on the east coast when Conan moves him to LA next year.....
5,Solid product,"Perfect tips to get under the gumline. Finally, a product that does what it is supposed too."
4,waterpik tips,Waterpik tip replacement works great. Don't know why you can't buy them from the store where you originally bought the waterpik!!
3,It works ok,"I would like more water flow like the original tips, but it works and saved me from having to buy a new water pik."
5,WaterPik Pocket Tip,"My neighbor, who is a dentist, recommended that I use a Waterpik with a pocket tip to clear up my gum disease and keep my gums healthy. It really works, and I continue to use it for maintenance."
1,product not fully explained,"I purchased this product thinking it was a standard waterpik tip, instead it was a rubber tipped gum massager. I think the product could have been described better."
5,The clearest book on AT out there,"If you are studying the Alexander Technique - whether just beginning or a more advanced student - this book is a Must! Easy to read and digest, it should be on every teacher's list. However, it is important to note that the Alexander Technique can not be learned by reading books alone. Reading this book is not a way to learn the technique. But it is a terrific supplement to private individual lessons with a good teacher!"
5,A MUST for students of the Alexander Technique.,"One of the two best books I have found to assist one in learning the Alexander Technique (along with Richard Brennan's introductory book). The writing is accessible, frequently penetrating, and precise without being overly technical. Gelb also succeeds in avoiding the two major pitfalls of Alexander books: the esoteric extreme (""Isn't the Technique subtle and complicated? How are you ever going to learn it?!"") and the how-to extreme (""Now here's the right way to do A, B, C, etc.""). I find it ideal for maintaining a productive ""beginner's mind"" in my Alexander practice."
2,An introduction that is unsatisfying,"I don't recommend this book if you want to learn anything at all about how this technique is actually practiced. The impression one gets from the book is that apparently only Alexander himself and a few other self-interested ""disciples"" (read: current Alexander school directors) are intellectually talented and/or physiologically gifted enough to learn this magical technique and teach others, so you are left still wondering at the end of the book what the point was of reading it in the first place."
2,Not Enough,"I found Body Learning: An Introduction to the Alexander Technique very inspiring, but sadly lacking in the practical instruction needed to learn how to practice it. It is interesting as a general picture of Alexanders development of his technique and its benefits, but gives no idea how to do it yourself. I was hoping for more."
5,Ezra Stone - Vol. 1,"Got the cd from Thor Intrepid !and I'm blown away !Massive Groovy Symphonic Melodicis the best way to describe the music !the guitars are so massive and groovy, it just drags you in a stat of mind where you justsit and smile and nod your head all the way throughout the cd !The keyboardplayer are always there in the background filling the holes (if there are any )and MAN can he sing ! WOW !Can't really put them in any box, with anyone, a total original sound !Ezra Stone's here to stay - Definitely !!This is their first full length cd, I can't imagine how good the next one's gonna be !Looking forward to hear more from you guys !NOW ... the rest of you ... BUY THIS CD NOW !!RegardsBernt Oterholt(Dean'aholic \m/ )"
3,New Book?? Same Old Material!!,"Well, this book isn't a bad option to prepare for the TOEFL CBT. Nevertheless I have faithfully purchased them since 2002 and the book is specially useful Whether you teach a preparation course (that's my case) or are preparing for the test yourself. There are so many options out there that you really don't know which to pick. I ordered in advance this new 2005 kit with the hope to get new exciting material not only on the CBT but also on the upcoming Next-Generation TOEFL, but to my great disappointment the 4 tests it brings are the same of the last 3 years. So, really that gives the impression that the update forgot the most important thing, new and more challenging material. SO please!! see your options before you buy this one, but if it is your first one I guess it's ok!"
2,Didn't work for my birbath,"My birdbath - about 3 gallons - was just as gunky as ever. I cleaned it before putting in the first packet, and refilled it with fresh water weekly, but it still was very stinky, with algae on the rocks. I'll be trying another brand to keep my winter birdbath clean."
2,misrepresentation,"I bought this item with the notion that it would be a 2010/2011 monthly planner. Well, it was not. I was deeply disappointed that I was lead to believe that this was a 2 yr monthly planner. If you are looking for a 2 yr planner, DO NOT by this product. It is NOT worth the money or the hassel. To return the product was also a disaster. The business takes off a lot of money for shipping and handling fees and everthing is via email (you can't speak to a representative). I wouldn't select this item or the business who promoted it as well."
3,Convenient -- But Lacks Detail,"This booklet (which fits easily into any pocket or purse) is a good comprehensive guide to popular duplicate bridge conventions, and provides good defenses to those conventions as well. However, the descriptions (and continuations) of the conventions are insufficiently detailed -- perhaps it has to be that way in order for it to fit, but that's still a problem. The print of the booklet also leaves something to be desired.Pamela and Matthew Granovetter (co-authors of this work) are obviously well-knowledged in bridge and good writers. It would be great if one day they turn it into a full-blown work with the requisite details."
1,Product Didn't last one day...,Needs to be stronger product.. Bird liked it but with in hr it was gone..... Not worth the money.. Sorry..
5,Bill & Gloria Gaither. Down by the Tabernacle,"I live in the middle of Sweden in a village called Edsbyn.I'ts called The Jerusalem of Helsingland because of all the churches. I'm not so good in English, but I will try to express what I think of this production. I have just looked at this wonderful Video. It was making me so glad and uplifted and I whished I could be whith yuo an prais the Lord. Thank God for the people who has made this Video.Whith God's love/ Per-Erik"
4,Another Celebration of Praise,"This concert with Bill and Gloria Gaither and their Homecoming Friends was recorded at Bethel Tabernacle on the Wesleyan Campgrounds at Fairmount, Indiana before a warm appreciative enthusiastic audience. As the name implies ""Down by the Tabernacle"" the featured selections followed a theme of an early era when Camp Meetings were an exciting time of family fun, inspiration, and strong Bible teaching. Opening numbers includ: Old Camp Meetings Days, The Old Country Church, and The Tabernacle.I especially enjoyed ""The Wesley Brothers"" which featured Ann Downing with Bob Cain and the recitation of the ""The Touch of the Master's Hand"" presented by J. D. Sumner. Other featured artists includ: Larnelle Harris, Jessy Dixon, Janet Paschal, and Jake Hess.The nostalgic testimonies of camp meeting experiences and the spirit of celebration came across as the strength of this video."
4,Excellent,This is a real treat. If you love the Gaithers you will love this. I am slowly getting their DVD's and I am so glad that I am. I watch one every night before I go to sleep. Gets my mind off the things of the world and on my Abba Father.
1,Do not purchase!!!,"We use these pieces of junk at work.Of the few dozen from the initial batch we purchased, maybe half a still working. Most of the panels either died within a few days of usage, or experience chronic backlight issues, where the only way to reset it is to pull the plug."
5,outstanding book on facilitating the process of participatory decision-making,"Just chiming in with the many other 5-star reviews. If you buy just one book on facilitating participatory decision-making, make it this one! Well-planned, easy to read and understand, practical tools for any facilitator. Great book."
4,End vision of dialog for ownership.,The divergent and convergent thinking were discoursed several books but this one is more insightful and let us promptly to practice. I developed a simple template for practice of both divergent and convergent dialog. The help people can track this ideas and other person's ideas easier. Thank you for author to inspire me more.
4,Very user friendly,"This book is very very easy to use, and delivers the content in a way that is both easy to grasp and to remember.The most important part is that, while other books on this topic take you through an ideal process while only hinting at the roadblocks, THIS book tells you what problems are likely to come up, and gives ideas to address them.Yes, the pages look VERY simplistic, and the large font reminds me of a children's text book, but it really sticks; made me laugh a few times too! (Actually, now that I think about it, it's more like a PowerPoint presentation style.)Anyway, as a city planner who deals with the public a lot, I enjoyed it and found it useful enough that it will remain in my office library."
3,"Worth the 5 dollars I paid, but not more than that.","I got this necklace because I needed something cheap to brighten up some of my office clothes but didn't want to spend a fortune in real jewelry.This necklace is not very nice at the touch. In fact, I should say it's very plastic-y and feels like junk. You do get what you pay for, and at five dollars, this was what was expecting to get, more or less.However, if you do not hold it in your hands, it looks nice and I have received quite a few compliments for it, which I was very surprised about. It serves its purpose to brighten up black turtlenecks and brown jumpers, so I am relatively happy with it.I can't honestly give it more than three stars, because it is not a fabulous piece but the price is fair and if you ignore how it feels when you hold it, but just focus on how it looks when you wear it, it is an accessory I'd recommend and would probably buy again."
5,"Fun, fun, fun!","This video is fun as hell. Richard Simmons is a master & I love doing this workout! I recommend it to anyone, young & old, fat & thin!"
3,Richard at His Best,"I ""thought"" it was a low-impact workout, since we are all growing older. Richard was his high-energy self, but I failed to see how he has become slower (as I have). I have all his other videos because I love to dance, but was a bit disappointed that it was the same fast tempo!"
2,Disappointed,"This is a warning to those with any type of shoulder issue. You will need to modify most of the moves in this exercise DVD. There are a LOT of over-the-head, fast motions and overhead arm swaying. I agree with the reviewer who stated you could put on any fast music CD and dance to it, but it was a fun distraction to watch Richard and the gang. It was hard to follow, very fast-paced, but for a first-time run-through, I was able to follow some of the moves. Also, if you have any back problems, be careful of the twists. Overall, I probably would not recommend it."
1,Not for people with bad backs!,"I love Richard Simmons sweating to the oldies. They are great. I thought I would really enjoy this workout. Unfortunatly, if you have a bad back, it will only make it worse. It moves way too fast and is just plain awful."
5,Richard Simmons - good workout,"I usually work out to more difficult DVD's but I really enjoy Richard Simmon's Party off the Pounds. I love the music, it's fun and it gives me energy. I usually do it if I feel a little tired and can't do my more aggressive workout DVD's, however, when I get to about the 30 minute mark of the entire 50 minutes, I am thinking this IS quite a workout. I would recommend it for anyone."
1,Ridhard Simmons new excercise DVD,Didn't care for it at all. You can put your favorite music on and dance away. Not worth the price.
4,Hard work but fun and worth it,Simmons has been around a while but you can't argue with his method. Who doesn't love working out to good music and when he asks you if you're working up a sweat you are. I can't do the whole DVD yet but I'm working on it. Fun to work out to. I alternate it with other exercise videos.
4,Party on!,"This DVD gets you up and grooving. You'll get the hang of the routines quickly and you'll be jammin with the others. While Richard Simmons is the lead, he has his ""friends"" with him. They are a trip and vary wildly in looks, weight and attitude.To be honest, if you're new to aerobics, you'll be worn out in ten minutes, but watching the screen and they're still working it. Talk about motivation! The end shows each and how much weight they lost which is also motivational.Great for all ages, sexes, weights and level of fitness."
3,Richard Simmons Sweat'n Video,"Well presented, but hard to follow if you haven't practiced the steps. Best to use the pause button on occasion! He has everyone represented...skinny folks to fat folks just danc'n away....very fun. Have lots of room to do the dancing."
4,Works great but pricy,"I have nothing to say except it works. Within a day or two the entire strip is full of mosquitos and other various insects that are attracted to the SkeeterVac (I have the SV 27 which started immediately and has worked great so far). My only issue is that $10 per strip gets expensive when it has to be replaced weekly (there is no more room for insects to get ""stuck""). At almost $20 per tank of propane, $20-$30 for strips and $10 ($20 for 60 days) it is costing me $2+ per day to run the SkeeterVac after the inital $300 investment. I guess that is just the cost of enjoying the summertime in our backyard."
1,349 dollars for nothing,Skeeter vac 5100 worked once for one tank. Then after calling the tech support 5 times with them suggesting of buying new tanks (did it) and try to light it and hold it for five minutes when directions said thirty seconds should have been a hint. Skeeter vac said sorry it is a popular unit and that they could not help. 349 dollars wasted and no help for a unit I owned for 35 days.
2,Does not work too well,Have it in our backyard for just about 3 months. Reduces the population of mosquitos but does not eliminate it. I placed it right in the backyard 25x70 feet and still get bit if we are sitting on the patio 30 feet from the SkeeterVac. This is the first season maybe next season will be better
1,EVERYTHING sticks to this,"I used this with my SkeeterVac and am not going to use it anymore. The reason is pretty serious: the TacTrap it attracts every insect, not just mosquitoes, and that is not good for the ecology. Within one evening it was coated with gnats, about a hundred harmless moths, honeybees, and several other kinds of harmless, flying insects that I can't really justify trapping.The SkeeterVac's carbon dioxide attractor is more than adequate for my yard. All I want to do is attract the mosquitoes away from humans, and the SkeeterVac by itself does a great job for that without the lure cartridge or TacTrap."
2,Difficult to use,I used the first trap and had an awful time trying to put the sticker on my trap. It must have been stored for a very long time or stored improperly. The protective film was almost impossible to remove. I hope they are not all like this one was.
5,Mosquitos Love This!,Amazon is the cheapest place I can find to get these since I'm off the road system and can't drive to a store. They work great with the Skeeter Vac.
1,Skeeter dud,The seller was fine and I had no problem with them. I find that this Skeeter Vac system is a dud and does not work. I have the large unit and a small back yard. I have put this unit on in early spring and still have tons of bugs after sundown.
4,A Great Listen (Even Theodore Rex!),"If you've never seen all these movies (and hopefully you haven't), you can simply put on the CD and enjoy the music of bygone monster flicks. Those who have an awareness of some of these movies may be absolutely flummoxed by the choice of selections. The Godzilla tracks are givens, as are the King Kong ones, and the collection of Caveman Movie tracks somewhat makes sense. But what compelled the Prague Philharmonic to try their hand at the Main Title from ""Theodore Rex""? Or ""We're Back! - A Dinosaur's Story""? Although these films don't fit into anyone's category of ""Monster Movie"" (and to be technical, the sheer awfulness and subsequent non-release of TR may cause some to argue its categorization as a ""movie""), the music holds up very well. Neat liner note art, as well (c'mon, Amazon.com, show it!)."
5,The first book I fell in love with,I first read this fifteen years ago at the age of 17. It touched my heart so much at that age that I read it repeatedly until the pages fell out of it. I highly encourage people to read this if they have a soft spot for love stories.
3,Mixed feelings...,"I have always read novels by Danielle Steel, even though I sometimes find her storylines repetitive, sugar-coated, and far fetched. I felt ""Message From Nam"" was more of the latter. The main character, Paxton, falls madly, deeply, hopelessly, in love with three men (who each in their own way make her feel like she's ""never felt before""). However, I still was very engrossed in the story. I would recommend it; maybe I was distressed because she falls for these men so soon after the previous one has died! The ending was a bit long, but worth it!"
2,disappointing,"The style of writing is simply awful. This is one of the very few books I could not finish. The story is mediocre, the prose dry, and the characters over explained and analyzed. I was disappointed from the beginning, but plodded on for almost 40% into the book, thinking about all the great reviews I read, until I couldn't stand it any more. I almost want to give it only 1 star."
3,Nam-by pamby,"Well, I'm not a veteran and don't much enjoy reading romances, so this offering had little of interest, but some: it was interesting to re-live those decades of the sixties and seventies, through this book. And there is something to learn here about the war in Viet Nam, as some others on this website have indicated. The protagonists, Paxton and her first lover, Peter, who dies from ""friendly fire"" 5 days after being sent over to ""Nam,"" seem somewhat extraordinary, but who's to say a romance has to be realistic? Even one having to do with a war? I enjoyed the book most when Paxton finally got to Viet Nam as a reporter. Those episodes did help me to understand the war better. The love scenes are not that elucidating, nor did they touch my emotions. Diximus."
5,The Best Danielle Steele of them all,"What a fantastic novel! Its not meant to be high literature, so all the naysayers should get off their high horses. This is simply a lovely coming-of-age story that any true Romantic will fall for. I've reread it many times and this book never fails to make me cry. Once you get over the fact that its totally implausible then you can sit back and enjoy this immensely entertaining yarn (NO ONE could be as unlucky as Pax -people were dropping dead all around her! I know it was wartime but GEEZ..) Loved Tony, loved Ralph...loved this whole book!"
5,This Was without a bobt the BEST book ever,This book was awsome...it totally ruled..it made me cry ... it was so sad but so true .....I would suggest that anyone read this.
2,A waste of money.,"I purchased three similar relaxation CD's and found this to be the least helpful. The music is the best part and why I gave it two stars. The instructions are strange and feel contrary to creating a state of relaxation. I don't care for the narrator's voice, but I would have gotten past that if I thought the words helped at all. I listened once and plan to give it away."
2,The narration was a little distracting,"While I found the music in this CD to be very relaxing and effective, I found the narration to be a little distracting. Mary Maddux's voice is nice and soothing, but she drags her words out. It was extremely hard for me to concentrate on what she was saying because I was constantly battling the temptation to laaaaugh ouuuuuut louuuuud. It just seemed too stereotypical to me.I also found the ""Total Relaxation"" track to be less effective than other comparable programs I have tried. This program starts at the feet and moves up to the head. I have found that the programs like ""Drifting Downstream"" by Kimeron Hardin Ph.D. that start at the head and move down to the feet work better on me."
5,Great for Anxiety and Insomnia,I have been listening to the guided meditations every day and they have helped greatly to reduce my anxiety and related insomnia. I look forward to my time to meditate.
1,Flip and See ECG,I was looking for a resource to make copies of ECG rhythms and thought this book might work. It was listed that it could make 200 possible rhythm strips but what you get is a strip that is half one rhythm and half another rhythm and these really didn't help our new graduate nurses.
4,Easy EKG,"This book goes with me to work at every sleep lab I work at.I travel to different labs, and I never know what EKG rhythmI might see, and if I am not sure, I pull out my book.Invaluable, good price, easy to read."
5,"Sensuous, gorgeous film!","One of the best films I saw at a foreign film festival! By the same director who brought usBalzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress, this is an outstandingly lush film, very sensuous with gorgeous greenery and flowers (the botanist's lush gardens) and scenery that can't be beat, actually filmed in Vietnam rather than China.A young woman receives the honor of studying with the foremost botanist in China. For her internship, she stays at the home and botanical gardens of the old botanist who has a lonely daughter whose main task is caring for her father. The two young women become inseparable, yet live in a culture that does not accept their love, so they must find a way to stay together.According to the director, the ending is inspired by actual events. Beautifully done film! Released by MAX Films from Quebec."
1,Terrible book,"I received a complimentary copy of a book from its author, S. A. Schapiro. I thanked Mr. Schapiro but told him that I am a lifelong atheist.I put the book on the water tank in the toilet and, when I was there, started reading.The book was printed by New Milleniium Publishing Co. in Milwaukee. This appears to be a vanity publisher for Christian books.And, when I started to leaf through my review copy, I found that it was a Christian book in that its thesis is that God was punishing the Jews for not accepting Jesus as the Messiah.Aside from that, it is horribly written and is full of misspellings, chiefly Elie ""Weisel.""I don't know why Mr. Schapiro chose me to review his book, but from where I sit, it is not worth the paper it is printed on."
2,"Just ""OK""",Pros: Looks great. Good speaker phone. Good reception.Cons: Horrible battery life. Not expandable. No headset jack.
2,Horrible battery life!,"I agree with the other posters. The battery life on this phone is worthless. I too, returned my first set for a replacement, assuming that it was a bad set. Same results. I thought I just had another bad one until I read the other reviews. This one is going back too. I wish I had another suggestion for a new phone. This phone has some really cool features, but it's completely not worth the headache."
1,Same problems,"The battery wouldn't even make it through the night without any calls. I took a chance and ordered a replacement off Ebay, a non-Vtech battery. After 20 hours of undisturbed charging it too died out after about 6 hours, even without any calls. Vtech wasn't any help."
1,Poor battery life. Company doesn't care.,"A few hours off the cradle, and without use, the battery runs down. Not even a warning signal. Charger problems, too. E-mailed the company, never got an answer. Look elsewhere!"
1,Short battery life!,I bought this phone sometime in October or November of 2007 because it was cool looking & I needed a new phone. I have had issues with the battery since January. The charge doesnt last more then 4.5 hours. Dont buy this phone unless you want to deal with replacing it or the batteries within 2 months!
2,More on the battery,"What else to say here except i've had the same problem. Vtech has replaced the phone twice and its the same issue. I get about 1 hr of talk time on a full charge. if the phone has been off hook for an hour or so, I get half that. Standby, I get about 4 hrs. Its too bad, because the speaker phone and features are great. I do wish it was expandable and wish it had a headset jack too. The sound is better than my Motorola, but the Motorola gives me phenomenal talk time and standby."
1,Awful battery life,After 8 months of use battery doesn't last more than 40 minutes on a full day charge. Save your money and buy something else.
4,Happy with my new phone,I purchased a VTECH 6.0 cordless phone and I have had zero problems with it. I love the features. No problem with the battery. I don't leave it lay around off the stand for 8 hrs at a time though.I'm thinking about purchasing another one just like it.
1,How dare they,"I was so happy to find this phone here so I could review it! In a nutshell:DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS PHONE. As it happens I am actually on Amazon at this moment looking for a replacement for this piece of junk.Huge battery issue like so many others are clearly having. Phone is dead in ~ 4 hours. May as well have cords on them. I won't even bother talking about the phone itself because that is a tremendous deal-breaker and should have been a show-stopper long before the phones were released to manufacturing. I'm actually pretty angry that these phones even shipped with these batteries.I hope someone at VTech is reading this because, though you have succeeded in stealing my money this time, I will stay away from your products from now on and happily tell others about my experience. Thanks for the soapbox, Amazon!/rant"
3,Poor battery life,"Good looking phone. Easy to clean. Decent sound quality.But the phone doesn't have a solid feel in the hand, the plastic makes a sqeeky noice which interferes with the call. Also the battery died in six months. Switching to speaker mode and back again is not very intutive, sometime disconnects the call."
5,Great Bargin,This phone is just what I was looking for. It always works and has no issues. Highly recommended.
1,"Worked great, for a while","We have the set with 3 phones, 2 charging bases and the answering machine base. This phone has fairly good range and does not interfere with the wifi network set up in the house. The reason that I am giving it such a lousy review... I have spent as much on replacement batteries that I could have bought a different set of phones at this point. The phones will die if you are in the middle of a call and hit the speaker phone button. The phones will die in the middle of conversations because the batteries that indicate they are fully charged, are obviously not fully charged. Replacement batteries do not work any better than the ones that come with the phone. I replaced my SONY phone with these, and they have been terrible. I would not buy another phone from this manufacturer."
1,"speaker issues, battery issues, not worth it","The speaker for the speakerphone is nice and loud, but every once in a while it fades in and out. After a year, the battery is only lasting 20 minutes before the phone dies."
1,I played the original...what a let down. Bad interface,"I was hoping to pick up something that would fill the time till the release of DAoC (Dark Age of Camelot), so I went with PoR. Big mistake, the game wants to be a ""Fallout"" but can't even come close. It has almost no RPG, the first character I came across only speaks the first line of text and nothing else. When you find treasure of any kind there are only 3 graphics: 1.) bag of gems 2.) pile of coins 3.) shield. You would think that with all the delays they would have added more graphics to things. The original interviews said that you could interact with many objects...this is untrue. They said that you could block doors with objects...not in this game. If the game was selling for under 20 bucks then it might be worth buying, but as it is right now...NO WAY. This is just another example of a game company less interested in the product then the $$$. Its too bad to, the original series of D&D games were great."
1,Didn't work,"I have a brand new computer (2008) and my graphics card would write the characters under the background scenery so I was never able to actually play it. I looked online but wasn't able to find a way to corrent this. Not the sellers fault, just the game software didn't work well."
1,How good is this game?,"Not sure how good this game is. I haven't even been able to get it to install. I went to the message boards on Ubi softs site and have read nothing but bad post about installing, game play, bugs, and not to mention a post or two about Computers being damaged by uninstalling this game. I would stay away till these issues are resolved. Save yourself the headache."
5,fun to watch,"Everyone will enjoy this DVD. Lots of good advice and teaching for those who can want a lesson. Fun to watch the amazing guitar artistry. No rock star attitude in David, he seems like a down to earth fellow."
2,This is book is a waste of time,"There is a rarely a case when I wonder why a book got published and this one meets that case. The content and examples are terrible and the order of the book does give any indication of advanced concepts in C#. This book tells me what advanced concepts in C# can do, but doesn't expound on here they are done. Terrible book and written for, well, I don't know who."
3,Decent but a bit boring...,I've read two other books by Kate Bridges and really enjoyed those books but I found this book to be a bit on the boring side. There wasn't much of a storyline to this book. There was no adventure or cliffhangers or anything to get excited about. The book was slow and the characters were just average.Although the book was written well and wasn't awful it just wasn't anything I'd recommend to anybody.
5,Take a ride with Henry Thompson and hold on!,"A fitting close to the Henry Thompson triology. If you hadn't read, the first, ""Caught Stealing"", or the second, ""Six Bad Things"" it wouln't matter as each is a stand alone novel. Still the effect of a 1,2,3 punch is better. A wrong guy caught up in a Hithcock plot of ganster violence is simply dead on. The writing is Chandler caliber, with this concluding novel, some ""Pulp Fiction"" spliced future action sequences, being brought up to speed at the chapters conclusions. Its a no way out: no best case scenario plot. Deal yourself in!"
4,Henry Cracks Me Up,"This trilogy is NOT my usual reading and I only got the books for my Kindle because they were free last month. But I got hooked on Hank. This final book didn't disappoint. I like the way Charlie writes because he makes me laugh. Even though not many of us can relate on a personal level to Henry's bazaar story, haven't we all at some time had disjointed thought processes like his...almost a running commentary with himself. Any book that puts a smile on my face in spite of the violence, is a winner."
1,Common and Boring,"Profane, boring, gratuitously violent, and altogether unremarkable. As I read this book, a deeply regrettable pursuit, I couldn't help but think that just about anyone with a cursory knowledge of rap songs and a vast arsenal of expletives could have written it."
2,Perhaps the worst in the series,"The first two books in the series were dynamite. The last book however, is seriously lacking the punch that made Hank Thompson so memorable. Hank spends most of the book either addicted to or reminiscing about pills, everyone whose died helping him, and baby sitting a hot shot baseball prospect. Oh and killing. There's some killing here too and it is a little gratuitous.Not a bad book but not worth $10."
5,Great end to the Henry Thompson saga,"Wow! A perfect end to the story of one-time baseball prodigy Henry Thompson, who seems to have one bad thing after another happen to him. Through crappy luck his life unravels and he's forced to travel to places in his soul that go against his moral compass. Through all the horrible things that happen (and there are a lot!) he still manages to do some good, all for the love of his friends and parents. His descent into hell is memorable, believable and makes for fantastic reading. I also love the baseball theme that runs throughout the series. My only complaint about this book is Mr. Huston's tendency to write clipped sentences. It. Was. It was just. Sometimes. Sometimes irritating. Just. Just a minor complaint. Otherwise, highly recommended!"
3,A bit trite,OK for a free Kindle book. It seems like the author is sometimes simply trying to churn out books.
4,Great stories,"Get all 3 books. Read them in order. The price is right. get ready for -'s instead of ""'s. Exciting story."
5,Excellent overview of Organ Pipe and Sonoran Desert,"As a college Instructor for a desert ecology-adventure course, I highly recommend this book as a general overview of the Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument and the Sonoran Desert. Broyles eloquently covers all the main topics of interest in rich poetic detail, making the book both highly readable and informative. Ecology, or the interaction of biology and physical environment, is the principle theme of the book, with topics ranging from desert plant and animal life, human occupation by native Indians, ranchers and miners, the geology, weather, and seasonal changes, and even astronomy. And the pictures by Huey and overall design of the book are fantastic. A great book especially for newcomers to the desert because of its inspired intelligent overview of the multifarious yet holistically satisfying desert experience."
1,not for the traveler,"I bought this book because I was headed to OP Nat Monument and I wanted a reference guide.Unfortunately,it provided little in the way of useful information for someone visiting Organ Pipes National Monument.Not recommended."
1,"To My Child: We May No Longer Live in the Same House, but You're Always in My Heart","I NEVER received the book. The expected delivery date was April 15. I sent an e-mail on April 20 indicating that I did not receive the product. I was sent an e-mail response indicating that the book was sent on March 26. I don't know if the book was lost in route to me or if for some reason there was a mix-up and it was never sent. Nevertheless, I have re-ordered the book again from a different provider on April 23 and have received an email confirmation that the book will be available to ship by April 27. A refund was credited to my account but as mentioned in my email, my concern was NOT a refund, rather my concern was receiving the book to give to my daughter."
5,Beautiful brilliant,"Basque is so beautiful. Powerful vocals like Lisa Gerard of Dead Can Dance mixed with only a bass guitar. Their music is powerful, simple, beautiful and soothing. All of their albums are great and I wish they were still recording."
2,Book,"I was stationed in panama for a few years and wanted to read something about the place, the price is perfect for this book. Started a few times but have not finished."
4,CTF Devourer gives it a 4,"This book, as with the others in the series, covers quite a few intense issues, but as they are real issues, facing real teens today, it is also very realistic. It also takes a look at what God has to say about some of these things. This is the 4th book in the Becoming Beka series, a story about a young teen who's mother died, who felt so lost she considered suicide and who became a Christian and is now seeking to live her life in highschool as a follower of Christ even while many typical high school challenges come her way.~ CTFDevourer.com"
4,A Most Intriguing and Interesting Writing Style,"I read this book non-stop in an afternoon. It was amazing! The story is marginal itself, but the style is what to enjoy!"
2,Dont dont read read,"Well maybe I am being a bit harsh in the title..the book, after all, did keep me turning the pages..but more to get to the end to see if anything interesting was going to happen so I can feel like I didn't waste my time..i did."
2,"Easy to read, but there's no character development.","I read this book in one afternoon. I didn't want to put it down, becasue I was eager to get to the bottom of it all. Unfortunately, there is no bottom! Except for ""Joey One Way"", who I assume is Rose's fantasy of himself, there is no development of the other characters in the book. Resultingly, there's no real story."
1,One of the worst books I've ever read...,"Yep, I was drawn in by the cover and the blurb by Edward Bunker, but this is just a horrible book."
1,Stunningly Bad.,"Sleep, Sleep, Now, Now, that's the real title of this turkey. This is supposed to be ""edgy"" , but it's only bad. I won't waste any more time, other than to tell you, don't be fooled by the cover, type or ubiquitous Irvine Welsh (whom I love) blurb, this book bites. I don't know what's worse, that someone likely forked out a huge advance on this, or that my time was wasted with it. Stunningly bad."
2,"A REAL BORE, I AM ASHAMED MY NAME IS ON THE COVER.","Okay my name is Joel Rose too, and when I saw this book at the book store I had to buy it and read it just because my name was on it...I thought it was kind of cool...not too many people named Joel Rose....and also what is funny a friend of mine named Stacey thought I had wrote a book, she saw a review in the New Yorker, and thought maybe I had a second career.But after I read this book I realized what a bore it was, with a dragging plot and a fizzled ending. Fair novel at best.I won't give anything away in the plot but to say it was a real bore...Yawner....kind of ashamed my name is on it...Now I see why the author put a hat over his face on the backcover....but my friend still has speculation it could of been me....I told her please I wouldn't write this bad. I may not be a great writer, but I wouldn't put something as bad as this out.A real dud....I give it (2) stars instead of (1) because my name is on the cover!"
1,This book is doubled spaced!!!,This book is like a Dick and Jane reader...with bad grammar and a lot of cussing. The book is mainly three and four word sentences like:He look up.Joey look up.It's his sense.The book is doubled spaced! You get the illusion that is a captivating read because it is a 70 page book printed on 300 pages to make it look thick.It really is nothing more than a poorly written short story with bad grammar and graphic language. I liked the review that compared it to a comic book--only comic book writing takes more talent.
3,Depends on what you are looking for,"Kill Kill Faster Faster is not a well written book, but I don't believe anyone claims it to be. The main character has basically lost his mind from drug and alcohol abuse and, unfortunately for those who enjoy literature, he writes the books like he is typing on cocaine. Literally, on cocaine - as if he is sitting on a bed made specifically of crack.However, it is inarguably an original book, with an original way of writing. And he does this... well enough that he can get the book published, so he deserves some credit for that.If you can find it free (or for .01 used as it appears to be on amazon) and you enjoy a book's originality, it may be worth reading if you have an hour to spare. It's fast enough you can finish it in an hour, and then you get to tell your friends how much you disliked it if need be without wasting too much of your free time."
1,What a Piece of Garbage,"This hipster piece of garbage is just that: Garbage. Joel Rose is a talentless writer whose ""shocking"" narrative is only shocking by how terribly 'cool' it tries to come off. The Hollywood unbelievability of the book's stupidly named protagonist, Joey One-Way, makes for comic book reading, not literature. Utter schlock."
3,Description not entirely accurate,"These are very nice lamps for the price. However, contrary to the description of ""brushed antique"", which I assumed would be a metal finish, the lamps are painted with colors of olive green with terra cotta trim. The silk lamp shades have an amber crystal-like bead trim hanging from the bottom edge."
2,4 piece lamp set,"Lamps were a gift for my mother in law for Christmas who loves antiques and needed lamps. The lamps all came in one box and needed to be completely put together to even see if they were worthy of a gift for someone else. A couple of the lampshades were stretched out from being packaged and had noticeable bumps in them. Once put together though looked ok, but not great. Lamps were operational and were painted nicely with enough heft to them so they didn't seem cheezy. Overall not bad for the price. Leftover glue where the beads were glued to the shade was the worst part. Had to be picked off carefully so the beads did not fall off with it."
4,a good board,a good board works excellent i totally recommend this for a low end board a school kid would like this as a starter pc
3,Intel Desktop Board D915PGN - Motherboard...,"i have rebuild pc over many yrs this time time i ever gotton a board that was bigger then the cases i have purchase 4 the boards. but i'll deal with it and buy a bigger case 4 it no big deal,i just hopy my pentium dual core prossor will work in it, i know it fits....made 4 this type of socket just was reading the specs 4 this board but don't say if it will work or notScotty MFrom Bullhead City AZ"
2,Doesn't stack up,"This rather interesting attempt to stitch up an officer of the Indian army for spying is based on hearsay, circumstantial evidence and speculation. The footnotes are used in attempt to add authenticity and a veneer of research, however they can't be believed e.g. quoting japanese intelligence report on the bad behaviour of Australian soldiers in Malaya before they'd even arrived, and claims an officer had been shot by ""deserting"" AIF troops attempting to board a ship evacuating Singapore; there is no record anywhere of this event. The authors should face facts and accept that the British government knew Singapore was unable to be defended, had no intention of defending it and had handed the cabinet report to the Japanese stating as much when the SS Automedon was captured by a German raider with the said report, however,they failed to tell the Australian and New Zealand governments of this and Australia continued to send reinforcements at British request."
4,Nice rugged Thistle Feeder,"We had this particular feeder is use for many many years at our lake-front camp where it constantly attracted many gold finches ever summer and was subjected to sever winds and battering during storms and in the winter. Toward the end, the perch rods would not stay in and it became unrepairable. I have an Opus thistle feeder I love at my home I also purchased many years ago and I's still going strong. The Opus has a center tube that provides feed to the lower openings so that both the upper and lower openings have their one supply of feed. I wanted to add another thistle feeder at home but the Opus is no longer available so, based on the positive experience with the K Feeder at our camp, I now have one of these at home. It's working out fine. It's easy to fill with one hand as the top cap can be swung to one side for pouring feed into it.I wish the Opus with the center tube was still available. Absent that, I think this is the next best thing!"
2,major disapointment,"Wow! Did I here the same CD the Amazon reviewer and the other reviewers heard? I've heard that the Radiators were a much better live band then a studio band so I eagerly bought this CD. I have three of their studio recordings and enjoy them all, especially killer tunes like ""Zigzagging Thru Wasteland"", ""Hardcore"", and ""Red Dress"". Unfortunately, none of those songs are on the live CD; that in it's own woudn't make it a bad CD. It's just that the songs that are on the CD are nothing memorable and the muscianship is nothing to get excited about about. I kept waiting for the whole thing to catch fire but except a couple of moments, it never did. Even the crowd seems to have a hard time getting into it. It's too bad because this may be the best live recording of a rock band I've ever heard. Sorry folks, major disapointment!"
2,Product Changed,"I have used Dream Lash for several years and was very dissappointed in this purchase. The item arrived and the product packaging changed and that's ok but the formula also changed. It is not even close to the quality that I have been receiving. Will not buy again, looking for another brand."
1,Not The Same,"The product shown is NOT the product shipped. The original was excellent. This product is not only inferior, but extremely irritating to the skin, causing redness, burning and peeling.THUMBS DOWN!"
1,FALSE ADVERTISMENT,"I ordered a totally different product which was shown on-line, then when I received my purchase it was this item. I had great results with the other Dreamlash product therefore I expected to receive what I requested! I was very upset, returned the product at my expense because I was informed that I would not be reimbursed for returning the item. So actually I paid for Amazon's mistake:-("
1,does not work on me at all!,This product is a joke! I got desperate and bought it. I had used both tubes and nothing happened and would never buy any infomercial products again
1,Disappointed,I used this product for approximately a month and the only result was to have more eyelashes fall out. I had to discontinue use in order to save the few lashes I had left.
3,Live concert from 1948,"Pretty good sound considering this is a live concert from 1948. This was a 19 piece band. How did these guys make money? Anyhow, just like today's artists, these guys must have hated to play the same old hits too because the second to last song is an 8 minute medley with 9 hit songs. The liner notes say ""As always, the unhip in the audience indulge in self-congratulatory applause as they recognize familiar melodies"""
3,Frankenstein???,"The premise was great and the book started out good, but-----Neither of the main characters were particularly likeable. He was crude & obnoxious and she did some pretty stupid things. And if she had called him Frankenstein one more time I would have screamed! However, this doesn't stop me from being a Robards fan, you can't hit a home run every time!"
4,Walking After Midnight,I love Karen Robards books and have been reading them for years. Her stories are exciting and easy to read. Walking After Midnight is one of my favorites of hers and I hope to keep reading her future books.
4,Read it forever ago and still remember it....,"After a steady diet of the usual romance novels back in the day, I accidentally received this book instead of another one I had ordered.This rates right up there for me because it was such a departure from the usual, normal, typical romance. The characters were flawed, they weren't physically perfect little phaeries of virginal delight. They were physically and emotionally a mess. I loved the book.(with the 'ghost' plot device being the only thing that annoyed the snot out of me)This is one I always recommend. I haven't picked up any books of this genre until recently, having taken a decade break from them, and I'm going to order myself another copy of this.I really enjoy Karen Robards."
3,A Decent Book - 3 1/2 Stars,"I thought the book was okay. I would have liked it better if Steve was not so arrogant. Could not understand how Summer fell for him while he was still being mean and full of himself. Summer annoyed me at times too. Did not feel like there was too much depth to either Steve or Summer. In my opinion by the end of the book, Steve redeemed himself. Felt like the author was trying too hard to make the dialogue funny throughout the book, which to me was annoying considering the storyline."
2,Flat ending...,"Heard the taped version of WALKING AFTER MIDNIGHT by Karen Robards . . . it is a romantic suspense thriller about afemale entrepreneur, 36, who heads her own janitorial business . . . as such, the story opens with her cleaning the local funeral parlor . . . she is startled to find herself taken hostage by a man she thought was a corpse . . . there's a good deal of action, as well as romance, and my interest was maintained until just before the ending . . . that left me flat and, consequently, I wouldn't recommend the book for that reason . . . furthermore, I have problems with stories whosebasic premise is that people will fall madly in love with their captors."
3,"Lots of action, no steam...","This novel captured my attention in the beginning, but failed to hold it by the third chapter. I've read several of Karen Robard's books and enjoyed them incredibly; she encorporates fantastic plots, interesting characters and ultra steamy love scenes that keep the reader turning the pages. Unfortunately, unlike the others, this novel did not set my pulse racing, and often sent me looking for something, anything else to do. If you are looking for lots of action, a very slow-developing love story, and a little of the supernatural, this is the novel for you. If not, choose one of Robard's historical romances. They are sure to please."
4,Definitely a worthwhile purchase!,"Karen Robards has not disappointed me yet! Who would think that you'd choose a book which begins with a cleaning woman in a funeral parlor in the middle of the night, for a romance escape? Purchasing the book, on the previous escapes provided by Ms. Robards was yet another great choice! The book has suspense, true 'cop-loyalty', humor (as always), twists and love. A bit hokey at times, but, so is life sometimes. Not as riveting as ""Hunter's Moon"", but still a good read! Thanks Karen for turning them out, and allowing me to escape each evening after a LONG work day. ... Also, love how you always incorporate your husband and sons in your dedication. What else is more important? Wonderful ... like your books! Your hard work away from them is appreciated by me. My sanity restored by authors, like yourself is greatly appreciated by MY family! Thanks!"
4,Very Good Suspense Romance,I gave this 4 stars because after the first blast of action in the beginning it slowed a little (for me) and I felt that while the ending was good it could have been better. The book over all was very good and I even laughed out loud several times. I would recommend the book to others.
4,Not Too Stale,"The story was fast paced and entertaining, which was what I was looking for ... a quick read with lots of action and romance. If you have not read a Karen Robards book before, most of her heroes are aggressive and not well mannered until the middle of the story where the love-hate starts evolving more into the lust-love then finally love. The only aversion I had was in the beginning of the tale when she described our hero (the captor) with stale breath, it made me cringe more than his brutal behavior or battered ""Frankenstein"" looks. Perhaps, in the future, Ms. Robards can leave out a few sensory details."
5,THRILLING!,"WALKING AFTER MIDNIGHT is a fantastic read filled with danger, murder, a bit of the supernatural, humor and a passionate love. You'll enjoy it. Trust me!"
1,Graphic violence,"I realize I am the only one here who seems to abhor reading about violence, but if you are like me, don't read any books by this author. I skimmed 3, and all 3 had attempted rapes with the possibility of torture."
5,One of my all time favorites,"Humor, suspense, romance,- they're all there. Well told, and at times hilarious, I found the book to be a real keeper. (the tape is also excellent with LOL parts) I thought the ghost scenes to be a bit too cutesy, but the rest of the book was so good that I easily overlooked that."
3,"save your $ if you have already read ""Night Magic""","I read ""Night Magic"" a week before I read ""Walking After Midnight"" and found that there are too much similarities between the 2 books (even down to escaping with a pet) that I didn't need to read the latter. In general, I like Robards' books. However, when she reused her plots, I got tired."
2,Who could ever believe the Hero & Heroine are 30-something?,"While there was a lot of action, there was also a lot of very infantile dialog that seemed reminiscent of high school romance. I wanted a more mature woman to identify with, and while she started out competent enough, the idea that she fell deeply in love in 3 days is a complete turn-off. These two new lovers never had a real conversation (except maybe once under a picnic table). I was also disappointed with the plot. It was easy to see coming."
2,fare stuff,"Music has always been a strong point of Subhash Ghai's films. Be it the melodious Laxmikant-Pyarelal or the techno savvy AR Rahman, Ghai has always extracted the best out of music composers.Yaadein, music of which has been composed by Anu Malik and lyrics by the old faithful Anand Bakshi.The title song 'Yaadein Yaad Aati Hain' undoubtedly is the best the album has to offer. All in all - this album is fare stuff. Anu Malik disappoints after ranting and raving about how great this music would be and after having given us the promising ""Refugee"", and ""Fiza""."
1,fragile,"The watch is beautiful, no doubt about it but is not durable.Main cons I found:The plastic c-shaped ornaments break easily.The clip (pin) gets unsteady after 1-2 months."
5,Literature: the Human Experience,Very quick and excellent transaction. We had no problem with the book or receiving it in a timely manner.
3,Description isn't quite clear,"This item does not fit a '97 Volvo 850 with the SC-816 radio - which I need! It would appear that I need the ""Metra 70-9220 Radio Wiring Harness for Volvo 93-Up Power/4 Speaker"" even though I have 8 speakers.Visit [...] or call them at (800) 621-3695 to check your make and model before purchase.I can tell you that the wires, which are 6 inches in length, are color coded with a handy ""pin-out"" guide on the back of the plastic bag. The connector is a heavy plastic which has a good weight to it and should not crack or break during installation."
5,some cats like it and some cats don't,"Squeak hates it, but his brother Hollywood likes it, and his other brother O Dark 30 can't get enough of it (Do you know they made a movie with my cat's name?), and their other brother Checkers and their Mom Tootsie gobble it down too. Of course the last three live outdoors on a farm and eat all kinds of tasty rodents but still go for Inova because it tastes good and doesn't have to be caught. It might be better than mice although without the ro-++++++ughage and it comes in a can. Typing help from Squeak"
4,Excellent Guide to Life and Practice for the Martial Artist,"Regardless of what style you practice, you will find these lectures to be very inspiring and thought provoking. I keep a copy at work and reference it each day I come in."
5,Mother's Blessing,"The music is lovely for a yoga class or just easy listening to mellow out to. It is soft, rhythmic and has beautiful harmonies. I find it very soothing to listen to."
2,It runs out too quickly..,"They said that these are not supposed to dry out, but they dry out much faster than standard highlighters with caps. I recommend the standard Avery Hi-Liter #240XX."
4,Fascinating,"I liked hearing from Tetrazzini herself how she achieved such a wonderful sound, what her ""secrets"" were. This book was a very nice change from the usual technical material. I thought the personal information and insights were interesting. I'm even re-reading it now with my highlighter, just to make sure I get every thing I can out of it."
3,A worthwhile read for vocal students,"This book contains some excellent points and vocal tips given by two great singers of their time. One must however disregard much of the negativity and arrogance with which the book was written - there is no ""foolproof"" method for singing and each person must unlock their individual potential. It is true, however, that essentially, one must sing naturally and comfortably, as this book emphasizes."
4,A Man's Ruin In Three Chapters,"Ningen Shikkaku (No Longer Human) employs unsentimental, autobiographical language, to show a protagonist trapped between the Japanese traditions of his aristocratic family and the impact of an infiltrating Western culture. Three chapters divide the man's life, revealing his path towards self-destruction in the guise of alcohol abuse, prostitution, and suicide attempts.The fatalistic story suggests the impossibility of changing the course of one's life. Dazai writes, ""I find it difficult to understand the kind of human being who lives, or who is sure he can live, purely, happily, serenely, while engaged in deceit. Humans never did teach me that abstruse secret."" If you are interested in exploring the myth of Sysphus through a Japanese lens, then this book is for you."
4,Reading pleasure.....guarranteed.,"I have read the book in Japanese and, in my opinion, Keene didan excellent job, even if his foreward comments are tainted byall-too-often used theories and opinions concerning Japan and ""the West"". This book is simply marvelous and a must read for anyone interested in modern Japanese literature. It is Dazai's ""masterpiece"" and it delves into the heart of something truly deep, dark, and beautiful....and, ultimately, the great man himself. Reading pleasure.....guarranteed."
1,"Low quality, low value","Some years ago, I had a pair of folding scissors of this type that were very useful and of high quality. I had hoped to replace them with this order. When I opened the package, I found that the scissor blades did not slide smoothly together, and when I tried to fold the scissors up, this proved almost impossible because of misalignment of the mechanism. These scissors are unusable and could not be given away. They are being returned."
1,Broke right away,I used these only a few times and they fell apart. They are made very cheap and were hard to fold and unfold.
1,terrible & not quality,"I bought & will be returing back to amazon since it's very flimsy. Also, dangerous to open & close the scissors."
3,Quality Disappointing,"I have owned a pair of folding scissors for many years. There was no problem opening and closing them other than being a little stiff, which is good. So sorry I lost that pair. When I try to close this pair of scissors, the blades do not line up properly with their slots. I have to twist it a bit until they go into their slots. Then I have to push hard to make the scissors come together. This pair is definitely poorer quality than my prior pair of folding scissors, but they do cut fine and come in handy when I need a small pair of scissors. I carry them in my purse."
2,Turns yellow,"The white fabric on the mousepad and wrist rest turns yellowish after a few months -- yuck. And it's obnoxious that they have their brand name ""rain design"" emblazoned on the size of the wrist rest. I mean, it's not like they're Apple or somebody..."
3,Could be better for the price,"It works, but Kreg could do better. This clamp is not up to Kreg tool quality. After purchasing, I have seen clamps identical to this for as little as $6 with equal or even better quality.... ""Made in China"" strikes again???"
5,Good price works great,Works great and you will be hard press to find it cheaper. So far no problems and I would purchase again.
4,decent clamp,"I love using the kreg jig system, and just recently I found another use for this sturdy clamp.When framing, installing backing for drywall can sometimes be hard to shoot together tight just by holding the pieces by hand. You guessed it: clamp up those 2x4's and shoot em' together tightly!"
2,Alittle Pricey,I bought the hitachi nailer that uses these rods and the paslode rods fit in the gun also and cost so much less at my local bigbox. i would prefer to buy the hitachi if they we the same price but since they are $8-10 more all the time i will stick to using my paslode rods for now.
5,excelente,yo mire el estreno la premier en costa rica y ahora que salio en dvd no dude en adquirirlo es una gran pelicula para que se se sienten los padres ha platicar con sus hijos sobre como la gente miente en internet haciendose passar por quienes no son y luego secuestran alas personas para el trafico humano una historia digna de ver! ARRIBA COSTA RICA POR ESTA SUPER PRODUCCION !
5,Such a great movie,"Finally something smart comes around.Brian did a very good job it this movie. I hope many people gets to see Here be Dragons. maybe we're gonna make the society smarter!Brian, I am big fan of you and your work, you contributed a lot to my knowledge, I am now a smarter man.keep up the good work."
2,Jumbled Mess,"I have had this one on my bookshelf for a while, and I now regret pulling it down. As I was reading the last 100 pages of the 350 in the book, I wondered how Mr. Saberhagen was going to resolve so much with the remaining space. This created the fear that there would be the requirement for a sequel. Worse than that, though, was the reality that the author attempted to resolve certain things with a sentence or paragraph. The overall feeling I was left with was that Mr. Saberhagen produced an outline for an arc, got in the middle of it and decided it was something that he didn't want to do. Thus, we get the one book abridged version. The most interesting character, the Fisher King, who is huge in the first 100 pages is nowhere to be found in the last sections. Argh."
5,"Awesome recreation, Ivan is awesome!","I love this book. It has been years admittedly since I read it, and though I can understand some reviews saying jumbled, it was an AWESOME book. I thought it was creative in the way he put it together, and how it kind of revolves around the story of Merlin, without directly intersecting it per se. I still love this book, am ordering another copy since I lent out mine, and I frequently make DnD characters centered around Ivan the berserker. ;-)"
2,a disappointing adventure in the land of confusion,"This book started out slow, but picked up in speed after the first 100 pages. By that point, it became a whirling confusion with different narrators and time lines. Saberhagen seems to enjoy these time paradoxes and overlaps employed in the book, but they lacked believability. All the jumps made it difficult to give time for proper character development. If given some more time and a few hundred additional pages, this book could work. As it is now, it was a bit contrived."
2,Extremely disappointing,"I've always felt Saberhagen's weakness was in writing endings. He almost always does a great job of shifting points of view and keeping multiple plot lines suspended simultaneously, but his conclusions often feel abrupt to me (Empire of the East was a notable exception).The first half of Merlin's Bones is perfectly entertaining, a well-constructed set-up and development. But suddenly it's as though Saberhagen forgot how to tell a story and is reduced to summarizing the action. It's quite bizarre. I finished the book, but I'm not sure why."
3,"Could have been better, too many loose ends","The writer, who I was previously never heard of must have been hoping to write a sequel because there were so many loose ends! Someone typed in the reviews that Saberhagen has had ""trouble"" writing endings - I see that as not a problem because he didn't really write an ending! I like the others found the jump from the future to Amby to Bran and Hakon not so much confusing, but distracting without having much to pull them together expept at the very end. Who, by the way is the Fisher King? I never figured that one out either but I did not spend long reading this book because it was not as interesting as I hoped that it would be. Pick it up if you have the time - the basic plot of the story is fine, the characters (for the most part) interesting, and the twists worth reading - if you prepare yourself not to be thoroughly pleased with the ""un""ending."
4,Babushka Lady,"Beverly was there.In her book, Bererly Oliver provides proof she was there (the information is hidden but it is there). If you are familiar with the assassination story, Beverly was working in Jack Ruby's nightclub as a singer/dancer and was reluctant to come forward. As a consultant to the movie JFK she provided the words ""if they can kill a president of the United States, do you think they'd hesitate to kill a showgirl?""Her words of course describe someone very high in the US Government but the book does not zero in on who was behind the crime of the century.Beverly heard the correct number of shots. She also described the biggest secret concerning the assassination correctly.Beverly Oliver was there."
5,Amazing Story,"Once you pick this book up, you can't put it down. It is one of the most inspirational stories ever told. It is the only book I know of written by a person who actually knew the key players in the assassination. This book is an amazing story and it appears that this story has now been proven to be true."
1,A book written by a fame hungry liar,"Beverly Oliver was not in Dealy plaza during Kennedy's assassination, and is perhaps the biggest liar alive today.She cannot support any of her contentions about being a witness and her book is just an example of the two adages- ""A fool and his money are soon parted"" (this is you if you buy this piece of tripe), and ""There is a sucker born every minute.""Beverly Oliver waited over ten years to spring her preposterous story on the public and the thing is so shot full of holes that you could sail a ship through some of them. Save your money!"
5,The Star Wars Poster Book,"I'll be the first to call it the ""Bible"" for Star Wars movie posters and I certainly won't be the last.I gave up counting the times I said ""wow"" while turning the pages.I especially enjoyed the bootleg section as I feel it's about time this important information be put in writing for everyone to read.Mark my words this book will become legendary and will change the way Star Wars movie posters are bought and sold!"
4,Interesting even for the non-star wars addicted,"I got this book for my husband as an attachment to the ""Creating the Worlds of Star Wars: 365 Days (Abrams' 365 Days)"". My husband has a large Star Wars collection and I didn't know what to get to add to it. He loved this book and I even found it very interesting. It showcases all the posters even ones I had no idea existed and ones from other countries. I found the perspective the different countries took to make a poster from was very interesting."
2,Did not enjoy,I thought the information in this book was not usefull to me in any way. I was really disapointed.
2,hope u have small feet!,"The quality of the socks themselves is great, but one major drawback is the hole you put your foot into the sock. That thing does NOT stretch enough to get your foot in it, each time I put these on it feels like the elastic in the band is going to snap, seriously I can barely get them on. I wear a 10.5 reg, once the sock is on it fits fine, its just that getting it on is a pain. I wouldn't recommend these to anyone."
5,Keeps getting better with every listen,"I'd been listening to this album for about a week on an online service before it was released as a CD and it's been on nearly constant repeat ever since. This album is a great example of Gov't Mule at their best. Blending blues, southern rock, ""classic"" rock, reggae into something that's distinctly Gov't Mule, this is an album that should make new listeners happy while still keeping die hard fans coming back for more."
3,"Decent Mule, Lackluster Production","I had high hopes for this release. It's tough to live up to Dose. This album doesn't do it for me - Life Before Insanity was better. The songs are average, most of the solos are uninspired.The real downer for me is the production. If the previous albums had the sonic width of a fat sharpie, the sound on this is about as wide as a pencil lead. From the first chord and cymbals on ""Mr. High and Mighty"" it is clear that this entire recording has been overcompressed beyond belief. Is this Gordie Johnson's fault? He did co-produce, mix and engineer this album. Anyway, too engineered and not enough raw Mule for this (since 1995) fan."
2,They've joined the Loudness Wars!,"As other reviewers have stated, the sound mastering of this latest Mule recording is awful. With the needles pegged and compression maxed, it's not an easy listen. Too bad because they're still a good band--not as good as with Allen Woody, but still better than much of what's out there! The brooding slow songs don't do much for me, either.To the real matter at hand: STOP THE MADNESS WITH THE LOUDNESS WARS ALREADY!!!! Please?"
4,Love that Govt Mule Sound,This is the Best overall CD That the Mule has done so-far. The addition of a Keyboard has enhanced their total sound.
3,"GREAT FIRST HALF, DULL SECOND","For the first half this is probably the best i've ever heard the band, Warren Haynes guitar playing is on fire, the riffs are stormers and there is a fair dose of Free in the compositions. Excellant stuff. Just wish the keyboards were much more prominent as they were on 'deja' They are so far down in the mix that they might as well not be there. But Oh dear..somewhere in the second half the Mule really do lose it. There is a pitifully dull lengthy psueso-reggae track with a half baked riff and little structure. The tempo on the other tracks is medium to slow and the ballads are pretty non descript. Why oh why fade out some of the solo's and stretch out the others? Look this isn't bad, but i was left feeling dissapointed with the 50/50 quality of the songs."
4,this album lives up to its title,What a great album! Having been a long time fan this to me is more mainstream and commercialized than their earlier efforts.The work pays off.I love this album and hopefully you will too!
4,High and Mighty,"Having only just recently recieved 'High and Mighty' and being a long time fan,my initial reaction has been ""have I heard this before?"". Guess I was expecting a little more musical growth and a wider sonic contribution from Danny in particular. Deja Voodoo was a strong start, am I alone in feeling that Warren in particular is recycling licks& ideas some what?"
3,"LOVE THE MULE ALSO, BUT....","I TOTALLY AGREE WITH THE REVIEW FROM MR. LEONARD, READ HIS REVIEW. THIS ALBUM IS NOT THE GOV'T MULE THAT WAS ONCE WAS, BUT THERE ARE SOME GOOD SONGS HERE. THE HIGHLIGHTS ARE TRACK 1,5,11 AND 12. THIS BAND IS SLIPPING AWAY FROM THAT SOUND THEY ONCE HAD AND EACH NEW ALBUM IS A LITTLE FARTHER AWAY FROM THE POWER TRIO THAT WAS STARTED IN 1994. SECOND, THE PRODUCTION ON THIS ALBUM IS HARSH AND COMPRESSED, UNLIKE THE FAT AND WARM TONES ON ALL THEIR OTHER RELEASES. I THINK CHANGING PRODUCERS AFTER 8 YEARS WAS A BIG MISTAKE. ""IF IT AIN'T BROKE, WHY TRY TO FIX IT"". THE FIRST 5 ALBUMS WITH ALLEN WOODY ARE BY FAR THE ONES TO HAVE. I WOULD RECOMMEND ANY ALBUM OF MULE PRIOR TO 2001."
1,Warren Haynes (Gov't Mule) does AC/DC??,"To say I'm dissapointed by this album is an understatement. After enjoying Deja Voodoo VERY MUCH I was anticipating another album of equal or greater quality with High and Mighty. Alsa, NOT so. WEAK lyrics, not Warren's best singing, and my word, what has happened to his guitar tone?? Fizzy, buzzy. (??) Did he trade in high Soldano and Diaz amps for a POD?? Sorry, but IMHO this is simply an album that should not have been made."
3,Bom disco,"Disco menos inspirado que alguns de seus antecessores.Possui músicas fortes e inspiradas.Já dá dicas de exposio de um gosto pessoal do Warren Haynes, o reggae.Compre este, ateno antes comprar o MIGHTY HIGH, oua bem o sampler."
5,The best of a series,"During the great James Bond boom of the '60's Patrick O'Malley wrote a series of books about two eccentric American counterspies; Heoffler and Harrigan, each book titles 'The Affair of....'. The books were written in a light and breezy style, full of wit and repartee but lacking weight. They are great fun, though, and deserve he kind of dedicated following that the Modesty Blaise books inspire.The Affair Of The Bumbling Briton pokes fun at James Bond, Masterminds, and a host of other targets. It is the cleverest of the series, and holds together well as a story ..... something not always true of the rest of O'Malley's work (though they are all fun to read).The 5 star review is OF TYPE. I'm not claiming this is a great work of English Lit. It belongs to a small, unremarked little sub-genera, and is at the top of that select company."
2,Disappointed...,"I bought this pack because my fiance and I started Atkins and this was a low carb snack for us. I will say the taste was good, I really liked it. However, I would follow the directions to the letter and would still end up with less than half the bag popped. I would try to microwave it longer but that was a no go, still after 3 minutes after the specified amount of cooking time, there was still half the pack still un ""popped"". In order to get enough for my fiance and myself a serving size of edible portions I would have to make 2 bags sometimes 3. I think for my money I will just buy the already cooked bags of pork rinds. :("
5,Great Snack...,"Whenever I get home from a long day and need a quick pick me up, even before dinner, I just pop a microwavable packet of bacon curls in the microwave for two minutes, then, instant snack! They're delicious! They come in regular flavor and hot-n-spicy (my all time favorite!). You should try 'em... I think you'll like 'em..."
2,C'mon Kreg...a great jig deserves a great driver,"These bits have not been properly hardened and will round over in no time if you do alot of pocket joinery. Once they do, they constantly leave the screw head while driving. A big pain! The 6"" driver isn't long enough to drive fasteners without the drill chuck hitting your wood. Save your money and buy 1 good hardened long driver."
5,square driver bit set,"Wanted a spare set in case my other ones got misplaced or lost.I like the short one,where you don't have room for the long one."
2,you don't really need this,The Kreg jig comes with a driver so you don't relly need this unless you want an extra.
1,Where is the package?,I ordered this item on August 14th. Here it is August 24th and still not here?
3,Over rated,The storyline was weak and the jokes only somewhat funny. I could have spent my time better by watching something else.
4,A very interesting book,A collection of articles gathers the latest thinking on the strategic significance of corporate social responsibility: a very interesting book!
2,If you thought Stephanie was annoying in the book...,"Try getting through this on AUDIO CASSETTE as I did! The man did a good job with Kinky's voice but when he did Stephanie saying something like ""I wish YOU'D drop dead, pencil di*k"", he sounded like a transvestite. An annoying one.I agreed with the other person who said it was lame how Kinky solved this one. It bothered me to. Really a total cheat, and the ending was dull leaving you with...""that's IT""?Pass this one up, or save it for the last Kinky book you ever read."
2,Flimsy,"A very weak plot serves to string together clever dialog, literary trivia and the local color of Hawaii.It starts off cute and devolves.KF dutifully works in references to all of Hawaii's pop culture, but somehow misses Spam. Not all the Hawaiiana is on target. One error is saying that Queen Lilioukalani was married to David Kalakua. She was his sister and was married to John Dominis.Can those who enter Hawaii on private planes really avoid the pet quarantine?"
1,He started out so good...,"I graduated from Kinky Friedman (the Lasso from El Paso) and the Texas Jewboys to his mysteries, and was more than pleased. Like his music, his first novels were great, and improved with age. Somewhere along the line, about six books into the series, he got lazy. The dialog is no longer witty, just trite. Steppin' on a Rainbow is awful. Kinky has just stopped trying."
3,Not a good introduction to Kinky,"Having read everything that Donald Westlake has written, I am always looking for other authors of comic mysteries. A friend suggested Kinky Friedman so I bought ""Steppin On A Rainbow."" I'll try another of his books because he is so popular that they have got to be better but it will be the last if it's like this one. The main character has some great lines and is certainly likeable enough and so are his cohorts but his love interest, Stephanie DuPont, has got to be the most obnoxious character in all of literature. I was hoping that she might get bumped off before the end so she doesn't reappear in any other books. I also had a problem with Kinky getting the solution to the case in a dream rather than by clever detective work. Not a great mystery but good enough to try another."
1,Who are these people????,"I've read all of The kinky Mysteries, save for ""While the Cat's away"" (which is a mystery in itself) and have loved them all and enjoyed seeing Kinky's style progress though the years. ""Rainbow"" reads as if it were written by someone trying to write like Kinky. Not only is he out of his element, New York, but worst of all, He's recycled a character and changed him completely.He's traveled before and wrote about it well, but to take a bee-keeping loner from Texas with a nervous twitch (""Armadillos and Old Lace"") and turn him into a friendly news photographer who used to be a Nashville buddy. . .It's like reading a story set in the fifties that mentions FM Radio, Laptops or the space shuttle...Hopefully, the next book will actually be written BY the Kinkster."
4,"Very good, but a slow starter","Let me start out by saying that I own every book Kinky Friedman has written. My husband even got me McGovern's ""Eat, Drink and Be Kinky"" as an anniversary gift this year. That being said, I found that this latest effort from the Kinkster wasn't up to his usual high standards. Maybe it was the lack of most of the Village Irregulars. (My God, does that mean I missed Ratso? Whoa...) The last half to last third of the book kicks into true Kinky mode, but there was a bit of traveling before we got there. If you're new to Kinky, start with another one of his books first."
3,Classic Kinky with a Hitch,"This book will feel familiar to Kinky Friedman fans, with the usual cast of characters included. The themes of loyalty and loneliness are well drawn. This book is a classically enjoyable Kinky-style mystery; however, I must downgrade my rating of this tale to a 3-star rating. The character of Stephanie DuPont is so irritating and unlikeable that it is distracting from the whole. Unfortunately, she plays a large role in this mystery, so you cannot skim past her appearances. I hope Kinky's next mystery will be investigating her death."
3,could do better,"I have the same reservations as most of the reviews below. It probably didn't help that I'd just finished re-reading Armadillos and Old Lace, but I found the Kinkster's latest a bit ponderous, poorly plotted and when the action eventually began it seemed to be dispatched far too quickly.And you're right, Stephanie DuPont is a major, major irritation. She may be gorgeous but I think we'd all be a lot better off without her.It's still a funny book, though, replete with the usual pearls of wisdom. Let's hope the slight loss of form, is just a blip on the radar."
1,Dont waste your money!!!,"We have a Vivitek 56 inch projecter TV that we got 2 yrs ago. I've had to buy 2 replacement bulbs for it already! On the vivitek site they cost $400.00!! I found another reputable seller and paid $149.00. So, in the last 2 years we paid $2300.00 for the tv, and aprox $300.00 in replacement bulbs for far.........Vivitek is the brand that keeps costing you money. When we got this type of TV we realized we would have to replace the bulbs on occasion but was told that bulbs last 2-3 years of normal use. Such a lie. Also was told that replacement bulbs were ""reasonably priced"" Reasonable? $400 for a light bulb???$149.00 for a LIGHT BULB????? Not what I call reasonable! I would NEVER buy a vivitek TV again. BUYER BEWARE OF ANY VIVITEK TV!!"
3,DJ From Ellen Show---,"Modern mixed with classic old skool style music compiled by Ellen's DJ featuring the likes of Nena Cherry and Chaka Khan. Listed under Dance and DJ, couple tracks reggae style, couple house (electronic dance), one R&B, one soft-rap, one enigma reminiscent with different language, one donna summer style. Interesting mix.. tracks are rather long so make sure to listen to the clips here on amazon and if you like that type of music you will be fine with it. Good enough to get your groove on."
2,Hardcover version has two fewer tales!,"Beware of the hardcover version--this 'new' reformatted edition contains only three stories, whereas the paperback (original format) contains five! This seems to be the case with all of the newly formatted George and Martha books--caveat emptor!"
1,I did it my way!!,"Although I haven't read this book, Judging by it's cover already gives you an indication that Schuller's Philosophy is to feel good, do good, and be good ""only"" for yourself. The demonic argument of Positive Thinking again has been Schuller's way of proving ""self is the solution to solving life's problems."" This foolishness of Name it-Claim it attitude will not solve the biggest problem of Man, The Sinful-Rebellious Nature of Man of God and the Redemption Man needs to be changed. What a travesty it is that we have books like these to insult our intelligence and stray us away from the message of the Gospel of Jesus Christ.It's true what a Famous Christian Apologist had said, ""The only song people will be singing in hell is 'I Did It My Way!!'"
2,This DVD Sucks,Unlike the WWE This only has one match and alot of photo shoots which put me to sleep. I think I will stick with the WWE.
5,Easy high-quality connection for DVD player to projector.,"This adapter is to connect a DVD player or other device with a Component (Red, Green, Blue) output to a device with a VGA input such as Viewsonic's projectors for which this is designed. It worked fine and gave a much crisper image than the S-Video connection on my Viewsonic PJ506D projector (hooked up to a Toshiba DVD player)."
3,This is no cable,"Works as it says: converts composite to RGB, and that is very useful indeed.That said, perhaps I was careless when I got it, but I was under the impression that the product was or included a cable. It does not; it is just the adapter."
1,does not work from laptop to tv,"I thought I would be able to connect my laptop to the tv with this thing, I havent tried to go from a computer monitor to a dvd but, I guess that is not going to work either.To do what I meant to do with this item get a ""converter"", not an adapter. at least the converter i got worked."
4,make sure you buy from a good seller 99-100% pos feedback,"This is a wonderful book for playing games with your three year old, and helps them learn things at the same time. the seller I bought from didn't explain the condition of the book properly and it was worse than described, but still usable. I would have picked a different seller had i known it's condition beforehand."
4,"Looks great, very classy",This is great and looks really nice in my antique dark wood library bookshelves. It is much nicer than most magazine files and worth the money.
1,Poor performance,"I bought this phone because I liked the list of features and possibilities for expansion. The phone, however, fails to deliver on the basic performance expected of a cordless phone. The handset has very limited range and at times can even break into static within 10 feet of the base. I often have to switch to a different phone to finish my converstation. The answering machine is also very weak. For some unexplainable reason it likes to cut people off in the middle of thier message leaving me clueless as to what they wanted. From my experience with this product I do not intend to purchase any more Siemens products."
1,"Great design, poor implementation Would rate a 0","if I could. Loved the design and feel of this product but was very disappointed in its performance. After trying with two different 2415 units, I abandoned this product and switched to another vendor. The lack of mute button was annoying but livable as was the non-intutive menu system. I could NOT live with unreliable caller id displays. The phone frequently displayed ""unavailable"" even though my other telephones on the same line were displaying the callerid correctly. Siemens technical support was unable to correct even after a ""factory reset"" and I've now returned the phone (again) and purchased another vendor's model. Spending ANY amount of money for a phone with unreliable callerid is ridiculous."
2,Not very good,"I was disappointed in this product. The sound quality was poor (people's voices would fade in and out). Moreover, it was complicated to use. I returned it after a few days."
1,"Poor quality reception, awkward ergonomics","I thought this phone would be great after reading the reviews here, but after purchasing it I find that the reception & transmission are both very poor quality. My friend told me it sounded like I was talking through a tube. I also had some difficulty hearing her, and when I spoke long distance to my mother there was an annoying hiss that went away when I changed phones.The handset is too small and is, therefore, awkward to hold. I had little difficulty programming it, but did need to use the manual because the features are not intuitively designed.I'm very disappointed with this phone, and am returning it."
2,"I liked it, my wife hated it!",Basically the phone worked as advertised.. however. a. The sound was tinny and weak b. The controls were much too complex for my wife. (How do I get line 2??) c. Range was not what I expected.
1,Piece of trash--wish I could put no stars,"...The phone is difficult to hold and is easy to disconnect, but that is only the start of the problems. The caller i.d. often does not register the phone number until the phone is answered. (Before that it says ""ringing""--big help if you're trying to screen calls.)There is no message indicator for how many new messages you have, you don't find out until you listen to them one by one. The final straw is that it isn't charging properly, often not connecting with the base unit when resting in the cradle. Interestingly, I was in Germany this summer and the Siemens phone in the hotel room had a similar charging problem. I'm going to buy an AT&T phone instead because I like the features of that phone better. Unfortunatly, I haven't found a cordless phone with decent reception quality. I think there's a lot of money out there for someone who can make a decent phone."
1,Save yourself the trouble...don't buy this system!,"Initially, this system had lots of promise with its ease of use, functionality and cordless convenience. However, with use, the reception degraded markedly to the point where the caller on the other could not hear us. The unit in the downstairs home office was so bad that we had to go back to a regular corded phone. Also, we were very careful to run the batteries down to avoid ""battery memory""...to be blunt, the battery life on these phones is horrible. Overall, we are very unhappy with this product and with Amazon's refusal to take it back. The 30 day period is too short and doesn't allow for a detailed review of a product that is obviously designed to fail after a short period of use. I am unlikely to buy another Siemens product again."
2,A few more calls to tech support and then it's outta here.,Got the phone 3 weeks ago and got it all set up to replace my old 900mhz Sony number. I have a long house and the coverage from the 900mhz would get scratchy at one end of the house. I was so excited that the new 2.4 ghz would blow the other one away that I box the old one up after setting up the new one. First day of use my wife called me and her voice kept dropping in and out. I have moved the base to numerous locations in the house and the signal problems seems to stay the same. And it's not just the person listening that get's signal dropped. The signal coming in does the same thing. Terrible. I now use the base and Handset as very expensive alternate phones to the 900mhz. I need to return them I guess but I want them to work like they should. A few more calls to tech support on this number and then it's outta here.
2,Should have listened,"Like so many other people who bought this phone even after reading bad reviews, I too was suckered by the cool styling and new capabilities. Siemens needs to take these phones off the market until they can improve the clarity, or at the very least, should drop the price by 50%. I bought this phone with the knowledge that many people were extremely unhappy with it, but I chose to listen to the few who liked it. I tried every phone jack in my home (nine different locations) and just could not get a clear signal. Callers voices faded in and out, and I was told that my voice was distant and fuzzy. My old phone is a thiry dollar cordless Vtech and it is quite clear, it just doesn't have any bells and whistles. It seems that Siemens' engineers have forgotten that clarity is priority when designing a phone. If you and your caller can't hear each other, what purpose do all the extra functions serve?"
4,Satisfied at last!,"Purchased the 2415 and a 2400 handset... In the first two weeks I experienced three problems using either handset: (1)people telling me that I was 'breaking up' on about 1 out of 4 calls, (2)several dropped calls, and (3)noticeable hiss. Tech support suggestions to re-register the handset and 'reboot' the base and handsets changed nothing. So I returned the 2415 for another one. The new (base) seems to have cured the first two problems, but the hiss remains. It is not unacceptable and only audible at my end, so I am keeping it. The range and sound quality is not is good as the Uniden 900mhz it replaces, but the nice features like directory, intercom, keypad lock, NiMH (AA) batteries and compact size make it a good value. I have only had it one month so it is too soon to judge reliability."
1,The Cordless phone is lousy,Sometimes this phone works great and other times there is static that interferes with phone conversations. You never know when it's going to happen. It doesn't have to do with proximity. The worst time it happened was when I was on a teleconference for work.
1,For a good phone look elsewhere...,"I bought the 2415 base unit with an extension handset. From day one, the extension hasn't worked well at all. After about five minutes of talking my girlfriend claims that I start to sound like a dolphin, chirping underwater.This problem, by the way, happens everytime I use the the extension, which I now use to pick up calls initially and then go and get the other handest from the base. Kind of annoying. I tried Siemens suggestions to re-register the phones but it didn't work at all.I would look elsewhere before buying any siemens products."
2,Siemens 2415 2.4ghz phone,"I bought this product about 1.5 yrs ago. During that time I have experienced frequent breakups in conversations. These breakups do not appear to be related to low battery power nor interference from appliances. It has become very annoying, to the extent that I am shopping for another 2.4ghz phone system. Any ideas?"
3,"Great features, nice design, poor range.","I'm generally pleased with this phone. The features are great although the programming can get a little complicated. The design is the slickest of all the 2.4 GHz phones on the market. It looks great without all the superfluous buttons and gizmos found on other phones. However, I am disappointed with the range of this phone. I can barely get one hundred yards from the base without it breaking-up and giving me an out-of-range signal... and I live in a rural area without obstacles to reduce reception. My old 900 MHz analog phone had better range and my friend can use his Panasonic 2.4 GHz a half-mile away. If you're looking for a nice looking phone with good features this is the one for you but if you're looking for good range go with something else."
2,trasmit distance not to spec,"The specs say 150 feet indoors and 1000 feet outdoors. I can barely get 100 feet outdoors. Also, I think that the other reviewers who are complaining about sound quality have a point, although I personally don't care about crystal clear voices -- I just want to hear the words without them clipping when I walk to my garage. I will probably be returning this item if I can find a similar product with longer range."
3,average thru-wall coverage,"The phone signal doesn't penetrate Manhattan apartment walls as well as my Sony 900Mhz. Too bad, because the Siemens integrated concept and features would've been great. Waiting for someone to bring out a similar 900Mhz suystem."
1,Worst phone system we have ever had,I purchased the Siemens and 7 extension phones when they first came out. I should have sent it back immediately. We cannot get more than half the length of our house before the reception cuts out. Now the extensions crackle and hiss so we can barely use it. I am throwing it away as soon as I find a better phone today on Amazon.
2,Poor system with a nice design,"I wrote a more detailed review on the 2400 handsets since I don't know if its was the base unit, the expandable handsets or both, but this phone system is nothing but problems after 9 months. Went from great to junk in a very short time the the amount of money I spent on it. Poor sound quality after a while, handsets couldn't find the base, and customer support was very poor. Just about everything fell flat on this system.The digital answering systems is generic with only 22 minutes and no way to *easily* tell how many calls you received."
1,"The base is great, but those hansets are awful","I lived with this system for about a year, and it was a tremendous struggle. The base unit seemed fine, but as many others have noted, the handsets (also sold separately as Gigaset 2400) are really terrible. For very expensive pieces of equipment they are very unreliable, and the company doesn't seem very interested in helping. In other words, the customer service is really bad. I was very interested initially because the handset is one of the few powered by rechargeable AA batteries instead of a proprietary pack, which saves a ton of money and hassles. In the end, this turned out to be one of the few things I could say good about the handset.I am VERY impressed with the feature set, but the execution is just awful. What a shame- this system had the potential to be a real dominant product instead of simply a pioneer for the multihandset conceptI gave up eventually and went with a Panasonic Multitalk system- MUCH better- see my review"
2,Lot of Problems,"Siemens is a company with a great reputation for hi end equipment, but this phone system is a bad product. On the positive side, the features and functionality of the whole base station idea are fantastic. On the negative side: 2.4 GHz is notorious for microwave interference (I can attest to this), the range was no more than my old 900MHz, callers would daily complain of my voice ""digitizing"" or ""strobing"" to the point where I had to get on a hard line phone, the handset is too thin to attempt to cradle between your head and neck. Customer service is commendable, but I sent back every phone including the base set once and am still having problems. Don't buy this phone system."
1,Quality is a Joke!,I bought the 2415 and two 2400 extentions and I experienced the same quality problems as everyone else. After a few months of use the handsets stoped working properly. The person on the other end can no longer understand you and it sounds like you are cutting out. I called Siemens and was told that they no longer service these phones in any way. They suggested sending them for repair to a siemens certified tech at my expense. I will waste no more money on this purchase. There is a reason that there are so many refurbed siemens phones out there. Because they are all JUNK and fall apart! I will never buy another Siemens product.
2,Disappointing phone,"Despite the numerous handy features of this phone, it has some fatal flaws. The sound quality for people on the other end of the line is poor enough that I have been asked several times if I am on a cell phone. In addition, the handset sits awkwardly in its cradle so that one minute the phone is charging and then when you walk by a few minutes later, it no longer is. The bottom line is this: I've only had the phone a week or two and here I am back at Amazon.com looking for a new one."
1,"Oh, what a lemon!","I bought the 2415 base unit and 3 additional handsets last year. One handset was defective and had to be replaced immediately. The answering machine is ok, but has no display for the number of messages. That was the good news. The bad news -- NO ONE CAN HEAR ME. People constantly complain that it sounds like I am underwater. This occurs on 3 of the 4 phones. If I shake the phone, the reception gets better -- for about 3 minutes, and then I have to shake it again. Frequently, the base unit fails to communicate properly with the handsets and it continually displays the message ""Searching"" while the phone rings in perpetuity. The recharge contacts with the unit are awful, and frequently the battery goes dead even having been on the charger all day. I have two other phones in the house (a Sony and a Uniden 900mhz), and have never had any of these problems with either, so I know it's specific to the Siemens units. My advice -- keep looking for another brand!"
1,Sound Quality suffers.,"I have to agree with the second reviewer. I, too, thought he must have bought a lemon. Siemens has a great reputation but they should protect it by recalling this model. This phone has some of the greatest features I've seen and a great design. BUT... the sound quality is horrible. The microphone is way to hot, causing it to pick up every little noise in the background and amplifying it to excruciating levels in your earpiece. People on the other end hear a very distorted voice (I know as I just called my wife and she used the phone and began complaining about it). We bought it last night and it is going back tonight. By the way, there is no way to adjust the microphone levels, I checked. Too bad, this was the phone I thought that I wanted."
2,High Tech phone with no Mute feature,"Unbelievable!! This phone packed with a lot of features, expect for MUTE...... It may not be that important for some people, but it is a different story for someone who works at home. I'm sorry to give it two stars, but it seems to me that the designers made a very bad call here since this phone would make a perfect small/home office phone solution. I'm taking it back........"
4,Overall good phone system,"I have had the Siemens gigaset for about 2 weeks now. I have found this phone system easy to use. As far as range, I have taken it to the laundry room in my building, out in the back parking lot and down the road (which is about 1000 feet) without a problem. The walls here are brick and concrete, so this is entirely acceptable (why anyone would need to walk a half-mile away from their house with phone I don't know). If you want alot of range you should get a cell phone, they are cheaper anyway . The voice clarity I found to be good and I have had no complaints from the people I call. The features on this phone were meant to be used from the handset. Hence, if you want to know how many messages you have the handset will tell you (dial ""int"" 9 to acess the answering machine from the handset). This phone performs well with ""normal use"" if you buy this phpone expecting it to perform miracles, you will be dissapointed."
1,Siemens 2415 Cordless phone review,"I have had a number of cordless phones, and this is one unit to avoid. The answering machine function works good, but my unit had poor sound quality on both ends of the conversation. Called Siemens to complain and they agreed to replace the phone, which they did by sending a postage paid mailer. What they do not tell you up front is that they send a refurbished unit instead of new. So now I have a refurbished phone instead of new for 169.95. The display on the handset on the refurbished unit went out, so they agreed to send a factory new handset to replace it. The one they sent is also a factory refurbished unit! The sound quality is not as good as some other phones, such as Uniden or Panasonic. Save youself some grief and check out another brand."
4,Excellent Product,"For as long as I've had this phone, it has provided excellent service. The phone maintains excellent clarity and has lots of great features."
2,Complicated and Not Reliable,"We've had this phone for about a year, and have regretted buying it. The system settings, such as month, day, time, etc., are all password protected, and there's no way to disable the password, which must be remembered every time the power goes out or daylight savings changes. Leaving an outgoing message is also unreasonably complex, and involves finding a menu which is not accessed from the menu button! Go figure. Other choices in programming the phone are similarly complex and not intuitive. The keypad buttons have recently begun failing to respond to the touch. Lately, after replacing the rechargeable batteries recently, the phone has begun to drop the volume of the outgoing voice message part way through a call. The store I bought this from, Fry's Electronics, recommended against it because of the large number of returns, and sure enough, they were right. Don't buy this phone."
3,Great Sound and Design-- if only it worked like it should,"This was said to be the best cordless phone on the market, so tired of suffering through inferior ones, I decided to go for it. I couldn't be more impressed with the size and the design and the sound quality is the best I've ever heard. However, there are two major flaws:(1) Caller ID only registers about 1/2 the time, at best. My other phones never screw up in this regard, but this is annoying for our primary phone.(2) The answerer records *every* hangup. The ability to filter out hangups was fixed in the mid 1980's as I recall, but they failed to install said technology on this phone. When I called technical support, their answer was ""no phone has the ability to do that."" What on earth?As a result, I would only recommend the Siemens phone to those who don't need an answerer or care about Caller ID. As for me, I guess it's back to the drawing board to find a better phone!"
1,ALEXANDER BELL HAD A BETTER PHONE!,"Got this phone after 2 days it broke. You could not hear the people on the other end, voices sounded warbly, once you left 2 inches from the phone, the call would cut off.Also phone was tooooo complicated with too many buttons, numbers, memos, etc.A horrible phone. Called Siemens they did a test and said you have a bad phone. Bought another one same model, had the same problem.5 stars for Amazon however refunding me immediately. Bought the second one at a competing store to see if that would make any difference, it didn't.Also handset felt clumsy in hand. End of story,...DON'T BUY THIS PHONE!..."
3,ok - but doesn't last,"I have the base with an extra hand set. I have been using them for about 1 year. The battery life is ok and the range is ok as well. The voice clarity is good on both ends. The telephone has a lot of features and is its functionality is well thought out. However, the handsets are not very comfortable to hold and talk on for any length of time. The handset is flat so it is easy to accidentally hit any of the buttons. I have four kids so the phones get a lot of use and because of that the buttons sometimes take a couple of presses to register. I am looking for another cordless because of the units just wore out. For the cost of these units I would have expected a longer life."
3,"Nice phone, poor button life","We first got the Gigaset because of the attractive look and extensive features. The sound is adequate, but not excellent by any means. Also, I get better range from my 900MHz.I replaced the rechargeable AAs with NiMH AAs and got much better life out of the phone, not range though.As for the buttons, after about 3 months of normal use, they have become VERY hard to push, causing us to miss phone calls sometimes because we can't pick it up. Tried exchanging handsets, but it happened with all of them. I think the new 4200 model took care of this issue.Overall, we're happy with the phone, but I would suggest new 4200 series instead, solely because of the button issues."
2,Too much background noise and static,"Purchased this phone because of the multiple handset phones available, the handset was bigger than the others. Prime concern in a cordless for me is the clarity of the sound. This phone had very noticable background noise and occasional static. I found it hard to use for these reasons. Took it back and got a second but, it was just as bad. My old Ameritech 900Mhz Digital had no static at all. Wouldn't recommend this phone if background noise and static are a concern for you."
1,Extremely disappointing,"This phone deffinetly does not worth buying. Pure waste of money. Here are some points.- Poor sound quality. Far from what you would have expected fron2.4 GHz phone- Lousy ergonomics and features- Comes with NiCd batteries that i would suggest to replaceimmediately- Screen started to look ""crocked"" soon after purchase- Most importantly, the device finally completely died justafter the warranty had expired.Save you money! Buy some other phone"
2,Nice features but very poor sound quality,"I really wanted to like this phone. I liked the features, the simple looks, etc. But the sound quality was terrible. A constant hiss on all phone calls and almost unintelligible recordings of incoming calls. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone."
1,Sound Quality Ruins IT,"I loved the design of this phone as soon as I saw it. Picked one up, and instantly noticed the background noise. Tried different outlets, different phone jacks, moved around the house, etc. Nothing would get rid of this noise. I traded it for another at Office Depot, and same thing. I really hoped it was a defective unit, but it looks like they're that way.Too bad, because it's a slick looking phone with all the features I'd ever need."
5,Just what I wanted,"The set up of this product was very overwhelming but my SIP provider had very good instructions on how to make it work with their system. After the installation was done, this product has been flawless. I would recommend it to anyone."
4,A bit costly,"Item installation is not easy, most of the settings are default. However, there are two many parameters require set up and that lead to confusion. I had to print out the service provider instructions (3 pages)and go back and forth few times.Sound quality is good.I feel it a bit pricey for something looks simple. I paid 57$ for the item."
4,Great but...,Buyer beware! I was NOT sent a PAP2T-NA model. Instead I was sent the PAP2 Vonage version. I didn't purchase it directly from Amazon. It was a 3rd party but sold through Amazon. Linksys\Cisco should RENAME the models to ensure this doesn't continue to happen.Beyond that... Wow! What a GREAT product! I love it!
1,Does not work with NEC PBX,"We ordered this product in order to connect to an NEC SV8100 Telephone System. Even after sending a unit to NEC's Product Engineering, we were not able to make it work. The SPA8000 worked just fine, but there is obviously something different going on with this unit. Linksys Tech Support did not reply to any requests for assistance."
1,Tried to use internationally - have given up...,I wish i could comment on this product. i bought it to use internationally but have been unable to get it to work after days of trying... not plug n play by any means.
2,not compatible with Vonage,"After much time with Tech support it was determined this product is not compatible for use with Vonage, so it was returned."
4,Be sure you ask for a vonage unit,I ordered this device to replace one that burned up after 5 years... I chose the one which did not say it was a vonage unit... mistake!! The MAC number was not recognized by Vonage and I had to return it for one that was $30 more...
4,Review,A very good product which is doing the job it was advertised to do. Some initial problems with setting up but once this hurdle was over work very well. Highly recommend this product.
2,Make sure you get the right item from used sellers.,Watch out for some used units from sellers. I got one and it was not a PAP2T but a PAP2 which was a leftover VONAGE unit that is programmed for VONAGE use only. PAP2T is user settable for various VOIP providers. Some sellers don't know the difference and dump their leftover VONAGE units. I got a new PAP2T later from a online distributor and it worked fine.Keep that in mind if you want to try VONAGE. If you leave VONAGE your PAP2 will be a paperweight.
3,"Good ""fake"", hopefully it lasts","The device is working as expected - no complains so far (1 month in use).It was shipped from Hong-Kong and the price was attractive.I just hope it lasts since apparently its NOT a Linksys/Cisco manufactured (and should not be advertised/sold as such).The box and a manual look cheap/fake while the device and the charger have proper labels, with MAC address and Serial number (unlike those bad fakes referenced in other reviews).MAC address range though on my Linksys PAP2 (00:0F:18:30:XX:XX) belongs to ""Industrial Control Systems""...So 3 stars for that."
1,Will not work with Vonagae!,"I am an existing Vonage customer. I have been using their service for 2 years. Tried to move my existing phone numbers from my flaky old Linksys WRT54GP2 to the new PAP2T-NA VoiP adapter using the ""Move a Line"" website. (www.vonage.com/retail_subscribe/) NO LUCK. Error message is ""Not a valid MAC address.""After a few hours with Vonage tech support on the other side of the planet the senior tech adviser confirmed that THIS DEVICE IS NOT COMPATIBLE WITH VONAGE SERVICE. Wish someone had already written this review!My suggestion is to try MagicJack, which seems to work flawlessly with my AT&T; 3 Mbit service."
1,rkn,Wrong product was sent and seller did not seem to know the difference. It has been over a month since I ordered the product and have not received the correct one. I sent the product back and was told I would get a refund but have not gotten it yet. I was also told by the seller he does not have the correct product. I am out $14 for the return shipping which I assume I will not be refunded even though I am not at fault.
1,Doesn't work,"Comes with very simple instructions, plug in cables, adapter works ... or in my case doesn't - connects to power, connects to internet but doesn't do the one thing it's supposed to do which is work as a phone adapter. Unfortunately I waited longer than the 15 days to return it so wasted $70."
2,dead after 4 months,"Excellent while it lasted. Used with a SIP provider successfully for about 4 months. One fine day, the power led started blinking yellow and now regardless what I try, nothing works. It seems to get an IP address but **** from connected phone does not result anything. Based on some threads on Internet, seems to be dead and I am outside of my return policy with Amazon."
4,Nice VOIP adapter,"What can I say, works fine. Sound quality is on par with POTS. Lots of help online to setup the unit with most VOIP providers. Recommended."
5,Great little device,"I purchased 2 of these to take the place of 3 AT&T land lines, saving over $120/mo. Settings are massively customizable but setup was reasonably straightforward with advice from the voip provider and other websites. Sound quality has been outstanding."
4,Wish I'd tried SIP years ago.,"The first one Amazon sent me didn't work. Amazon had a working replacement to me in four days.I wish I had looked into SIP years ago. It's a bit more work than going through a commercial VOIP provider: you have to configure the thing yourself for your SIP provider and you have to buy your own DID phone number if you want in-coming calls, but it's much easier than you think, and voice quality is far superior to any commercial VOIP I've used recently. It's been years since I've used a POTS line, but I think quality is comparable and it's far cheaper.I have two complaints. 1.) It uses a wall-wart. The prongs snap in, so it may be possible to buy an cable. 2.) The admin UI seems like a step down from other Linksys devices I've used. The way to upgrade the firmware is particularly egregious. However, like I said, setup is very easy, and once it's done, you never have to come back here."
4,Works great with Gizmo5/Google Voice,"This is our primary telephone, using Gizmo5 and Google Voice bridged together. We replaced our Vonage device with this, and now our phone bill is less than $1 per month. Initially I had some issues until I discovered that AT&T ISP was blocking the SIP port, but after changing the settings and using a different port, we've had no further problems. Setup screens are tricky and require pretty good telephony knowledge to configure with your particular SIP provider."
4,Great device,"Great device, haven't had much of a chance to use it yet, but it works great with Gizmo5."
4,Internet Phone Adapter,"This item is useful for those who want to adapt their old analog phones for use with an internet phone service. It's easy to set up and use, and reliable. The only negative is that is seems to be more sensitive to power surges than the other equipment it interfaces with. This item replaced an identical unit that burned out in such a power surge (lightening). The item is not generally available in brick and mortar stores, so must be purchased online.Cisco Small Business PAP2T-NA Internet Phone Adapter with 2 VoIP PortsThe vendor was quite helpful by securing a refund when the parcel delivery service failed to deliver on a timely basis. I would not hesitate to do business again."
4,difficult to set up,"We found this void box difficult to set up and the on line help was only able to help to a point, in the end we had to take the unit to a friends house and set every setting the same as his, then it worked great, thank god we had his box to copy the settings."
5,Very valuable resource for teachers,"As a university reading method professor I am always on the look out for books that help teachers with creative ideas to link to books. Christine's book definitely has a variety of terrific ideas that can be easily used in the classroom. The activities link reading, writing, and the arts. The other thing I like about this book is that she recommends new literature that can be used with the learning experiences. This helps teachers to become familiar with books that have been published recently. This book would be a great gift for a new or veteran teacher."
2,A Disappointment,When I read the title of this book I was excited to find something that would give me ideas for having students respond to literature. Book reports are traditionally an at-home project so I assumed this book would provide alternative at-home projects. The book only provided ideas practical for the classroom and they are not suitable for projects. This book was a real disappointment.
2,Headphones are proprietary on the gameboy advanced sp.,"This case really doesn't have anything good enough to spend any money on. A dock is really redundant as every sp comes with a its own charger. Game cases are a maybe but ultimately, i find, that they just make it more difficult to carry around games because i have to store the cases away. Most importantly this set lacks a multi-link cable. Which is essential to any starter kit in my opinion."
3,Unfortunate,"The picture led me to believe there were earphones in the pack and the description didn't help dissuade me of that. I was disappointed when I saw that as part of the attraction was that there would be headphones.My son, 6, used the case and strap as well as the game holders and the docking station (which has kept the gameboy from getting lost, I'm sure, but the rest of the pack was a waste of money. The screen protectors fell off and he doesn't use the screen magnifier (which i didn't know, so that isn't the manufacter's fault), and since he puts the thing on the charger every night or so, we'll never need the spare battery.Overall, not a complete waste of money, but definitely an unfortunate photo."
2,Very Disappointed,"My son just received his new Game Boy and this starter kit for Christmas. I am very disappointed with the kit. As some of you have indicated, it does not contain the car adaptor or ear buds. Other problems - docking station cannot be utilized while the magnifier is attached. Also, the extremely small carry case cannot be used if the magnifier is attached. So why not just remove the magnifier you ask? It is attached quite snuggly and my 5 year old cannot remove it without the possibility of breaking it."
5,Works,"I am not sure what the other reviewer refers to when saying the cards don't work, ours worked just fine.In fact, we are ordering more now."
2,"If you have the money, go for it.",This stuff may or may not be effective but you have to take so much of it over such a long period of time who cares. 2 stars cuz the science is sound.
4,big price cheaply made,I bought this product for my wife and inlaws. Everyone that uses it loves it. Looks stylish and funtional but made very cheaply. As some others also pointed out that I was reading. There are other options out there but none as nice or funtional. I would recommend this product to anyone who owns a laptop. I would only ask that Rain Design makes it a little better for the money. I can just see those rivets comming out and me having to frankenstien it back together. I live to go to the hardware store.
3,Cool.,No real adjust-ability but it worked for my purpose. Wrist pads are comfy but they fall/lose strength after a little while
2,iLap Laptop stand ... not comfortable .. purchased on Amazon,"I ordered the iPad stand - which was so great - I ordered another for my husband. So I ordered the iLap Laptop Stand and was really disappointed that it was so awkward. The wrist rest was not really velvety, and was too stiff and high to be comfortable. Also, because of the placement of the wrist rest, it pushed my hands back too far away from the keyboard to be comfortable. I could have removed the wrist rest, but that component was one of the main reasons I ordered it. So I had to return it."
4,Works Well,"I'm quite happy with my purchase, it meets my needs; 1. Keeping a hot computer off my lap 2. Cools off my computer easier.Luckily this product deliveries in both categories, but the only reason I gave it 4 stars was the cost to produce this product. It feels cheap, like 15 dollars cheap but I paid $54 dollars for it... maybe its the patent cost idk.. but it gets the job done and that's all I care about."
5,"iLap Laptop Stand 15"" W for MacBook Pro by Rain Design (10025)","Robust ,uber lightweight product.Excellent if you dont have a work station/desk to use your MAC on.It stops your knackers getting roasted also .Great bit of kit"
4,Works very nicely,"I would give this 4.5 out of 5 - it works very nicely, with the slight drawback that the cushions sometimes need adjusting. I bought it to use with a 15"" MacBook Pro. The stand works perfectly: the computer (and my legs) don't get too hot using the stand.It feels a bit strange when I don't use the stand nowadays."
2,Good idea if it stayed together.,"This has been sitting on my shelf for a couple of years. I really gave it a shot. It kept coming apart and was too frustrating to use. I don't understand why the pieces need to come apart? The roll slides away from the lap pad and it requires putting back on several times. If you plan to be in the same spot for hours, it will work. Thinking about pulling it off the shelf and adding industrial velcro which might solve issue. I'll update if that works."
2,"Merely ""OK""","It serves its purpose but I was disappointed with the actual construction quality. Its thin aluminum with the logo cut out, ok not terrible but hardly reeks of quality.My mine gripe is with the hinged pad. Its rather squeaky and not tightly joined at all.Overall yeah, it gets the job done but is overpriced for what you get and leaves me feeling somewhat ripped off."
2,Disappointed,I ordered this product after reading the reviews on Amazon and elsewhere on how useful it was for cooling a computer (MacBook Pro) but when it arrived I was disappointed at the overall quality of it considering the high cost of it. For one thing the aluminum that it is made of is a very thin gauge and bends very easily. I would think it would get easily damaged if taking it on a trip or even during normal use. There are no indentations for the small feet that are on the MacBook which if there were would allow more induction cooling to occur. For the money I think that a much better cooling tray is the Cooler Master.
5,Beautiful + comfortable,"Excelent. If you like to work in the couch or the bed, this is the right product. It's very light, comfortable and looks very cool."
5,So Glad I Chose this One,"I recently purchased my first Mac, a MacBook Pro. LOVE IT! So, next I wanted a laptop cooler or platform for laptop use. I shopped a lot of them. Originally, thought I wanted a laptop cooler with fans, but based on reviews it didnt sound like they are all they are cracked up to be. I finally decidd on the iLap stand by Rain Design. It came today and oh man, it's great. I've been using it all afternoon with my new Mac. The Mac itself is staying cooler. The aluminum stand apparently does pull heat away from the computer and helps cool the machine. The stand is comfortable on my lap and it keeps my legs cool while working. The padded wrist rest is comfortable and protects from the sharp corner edge on the MacBook Pro (one thing I dont like about the MacBook Pro). All in all, this is a great product. A little pricey, but worth it. I'm going to order one for my wife now. I feel confident you will be pleased too."
4,It saves me from the sharp corners!,"I only bought this for one reason. The sharp corners on my macbook pro were killing my wrists. I know I'm not supposed to be sitting down with my wrist resting on the edge, but that's how it is. This thing is saving my wrist, and that's that!"
4,"Works Well With My 15"" MacBook Pro","It keeps my lap and/or my bed cool. I wish the angle of the cushions was more adjustable. I put the little plastic cushions that came with it, on the tray itself and it holds my laptop in place nicely.I like it and I haven't found anything better, but I do think that it is overpriced for what it is - but it seems to be the only show in town.My husband said that he didn't want one for his 17"" HP laptop, but when I got mine, he tested it, and guess what .... we are now a two ilap household."
1,Clumsy and Uncomfortable to Use,"I love Rain products and love their modern style. This item did not work as well as my $20 lap desk and the bottom support was flimsy and clumsy. I get the ergonomic thing but if you are working with laptop on your lap or in bed, it's uncomfortable to extend arm over the pad to type. Perhaps it works better for much taller person (I am 5'3""). Overall it's okay but for the price, the value was not there."
3,too short,"the clipboard was found under a search for legal clipboards. no dimensions were given. I assumed that the pencil tray at the bottom extended the clipboard to 14 inches. It almost does. other than the size, it is made well and i believe it will last."
2,Storage clip board from Amazon,This clipboard serves it's function for the most part. If is a clip board with a pen storage as well as a document holder. Bit the clips to keep it closed are already broken. You get what you pay for.
2,Not impressed,"It is ok..Flimsy kind of small, can't stack too much paper inside, for instance can't put a notebook inside without it bulging out. It is not worth my time to return it or I would."
4,An essential one for all the mothers-to-be!,"Surprisingly few cross-stitch books focus on babies but fortunately this is one of them. As both a godmother of a 1-year-old toddler and an expectant mom myself I found this book helpful when deciding what to stitch as a gift or for your own baby's wardrobe and nursery.Whether you are an almost beginner like me or ""a semiprofessional"" there's a lot to choose from simple designs for socks and t-shirts to lively wall decorations and celebration samples. There are also suggestions for varying and adapting these clear and beautiful designs, which broadens their usability. All the charts are colored and matched with DMC threads, added with easy-to-follow instructions.I would have given even five stars if there had been more of these baby designs - now something over 30 simply isn't enough for an enthusiastic cross-stitcher!"
2,"hardly ""perfect"" beauty.","While the blades on this item are shiny and new, you may want to take a moment to enlarge the product picture to reveal that the aluminum block they've been fitted into is oxidized. It's grey and powdery to the touch, which makes using this aesthetically displeasing. While the blades are sharp and it's functional, it's unpleasant having an object meant to improve one's cosmetics so cosmetically flawed. The manufacturer should switch to stainless steel, or beeswax/clear coat this sharpener if they're going to continue using this grade of aluminum for the block."
3,Good music but some sound quality problems,"Extensive collection of Dinah singing blues, some jazz. A LOT of the first cd has a lot of hissing and pops and crackles. The second cd has much better sound quality overall. Good cd for people looking for an extensive collection, but there are better selections for the casual listener."
2,DEATHSTALKER DIES,"Rick Hill, the buff hero of DEATHSTALKER fame, plays a fast shooting sheriff who gets caught up in a weapons scam in a small town. Looking a little older and less bulky, Hill demonstrates little emotion in his poorly developed role. All the other actors are likewise B movie quality. The long beginning showing the several different robberies all look and feel the same, so why show so many? Once the ""action"" gets to the small town, we get the usual suspects and caricature townspeople. Every time the town has an incident, the director puts in this annoying woman screaming but never show us who she is. The action scenes are unimaginative and routine, and ultimately, FAST GUN proves Hill should stay in the loincloth movies, and leave this type of film to guys like Willis and Gibson."
5,Tombstone,"As a freelance historical research photographer, I thoroughly enjoyed the written and photographic aspects of this book. This book on Tombstone has been very well researched and provides the reader with the necessary information without becoming a college textbook. It also provides the reader with numerous photos to accompany the written information. It is a nice addition to my 19th century collection of books."
2,Great... while they last,The headphones were fabulous. I got so many compliments on how cute they were. I even bought three more pairs for people in my family. Every single one of these I bought have now broken. Only one side works. Boo!
4,the sound needs work...,"I got these headphones and they fit great and they don't fall out, but there is a little bit of a static sound when I use them. It isn't loud, but there is one and when nothing is playing, you can hear it. It might have been defective when I got it, but I'm not sure. Overall, I will stick with them."
3,good sounds,I am satisfied with my new headphones. They're are very convenient in the workplace as well as my iPOD. Nice clear sound and nice length on with the connection wire.
2,"JVC ""Soft"" Ear Buds",These ear phones are called gumy headphones so I assumed that they would be soft. I was wrong. They aren't soft at all. They don't stay in your ear very well either. They make your ears hurt after only 45 minutes. The package says that they have soft padding around the outside of them but they only have hard plastic. I was disappointed in them and was very surprised to find out that they weren't at least a little bit soft. I wouldn't recommend them to you unless you like hard ear buds.
2,Good audio if your ears can take it,"These earplugs are ""gumy"" in name only. They're hard as rocks and really difficult to use for more than five or ten minutes at a time. The audio, however, is fine."
1,Not worth a penny.,"Although these headphones might be aesthetically pleasing to the eye the performance is awful. I have a Creative mp3 player and the headphones that came with it are about 10x better. These gummy things don't stay in your ears worth crap (or at least my ears) and the sound is simply bad. Not much base at all and the treble isn't even that clear. If you're looking for cheap headphones, be my guest, but I would recommend Sony headphones."
5,Dependable...lasted me about 3 years!,"I tangle my cords up in my gym bag, full of wet clothes. The cords knot up...I tug them out...my headphones get used and abused about 5 times a week on average. I've never had a pair of headphones last me over 6 months. And you know what, given my usage, it's not shocking.Cheap stuff breaks. Got it.Except these things. I was just miffed at the gym yesterday when my bit it--one wire is screwed up and the sound cut out of one ear. Then I realized these things have lasted me EONS compared to other headphones and I had no right to complain.Besides lasting forever due to abuse, these are perfect for working out because they stick in your ears, no matter how sweaty they get. They have a good length cord so you can tuck it a little into your armband for your iPod (my mp3 player of choice) and you're not tripping over it nor it is altering your run at all...Great earphones for any price let alone dirt cheap. Hooray!"
5,Great product!!,"Got this to use with my G4 PowerBook. The iLap looks great, is made great, and--most imporantly--WORKS GREAT! Using my laptop on my lap or in bed is no longer uncomfortable. And I don't have second degree burns on my thighs anymore! I've noticed that my computer's fan doesn't come on as much, too. Internal temperatures? They're lower, too. I think the iLap will give me years of usefulness and extend the life of my PowerBook. This is a great design! Get one...you won't be sorry!!"
5,This is a great paper holder.,"I love it! It holds papers much better than the little fishy thing, and it holds more pages at once. Bottom line, I can't wait to buy a second one for my home office. You can't go wrong with this purchase!"
5,Excellent design,I use this in my computer lab with 12 and 13-year-olds. They do the job and hold up beautifully.
1,Poor Construction,Broke in just a few weeks. The design is flawed. The cored that goes into the earpiece is not secured adequately and after repeated pulling (you have to do to extend the cord and retract it) it give out and you loose one earphone. Also the earpiece that the earbud is connected to is weakly constructed and is loose. I did not know this but I had bought the exact same design from CompUSA branded by Emerge. It broke the same way. This earbud should be taken off the market.
1,Don't buy! - came apart in 3 days!,"The cord tangles too easily when trying to retract) and the earbud came apart from the wire after just 3 days of use! Recommend similar product by Brookstone, MUCH higher quality."
4,"Comfy, Quality saddle for my folding bike",This was a great replacement for the concrete block that was stock on my Trek F-400 folder.
2,Read an d react lecture,"I got this as a gift. A 2 dvd set. the first DVD was just a lecture on the R&R offense - much too long. the 2nd DVD goes through the steps of the offense, needs more of the R&R drills ---- instead of trying to sell me another dvd and book to get these."
5,Finding Peace in Christ,"Probably nothing or no one else has ever been the subject of more artwork or literature than Jesus of Nazareth. And if you look through this book you'll understand why. The amazing artwork and beautiful poetry and prose contained in these pages will do nothing less than uplift and inspire. I highly recommend this book to anyone and everyone, Christian or not. It truly captures the gentle meekness and unfathomable love of the Savior in a Spirit of genuine devotion."
4,Bargin Music = Great Value,"This was an awesome value that I couldn't pass up. There are a ton of well-known songs in this package that would be an asset to anyone who plays for pleasure or for events such as weddings. The only thing I'd caution potential buyers on is the delicate paper used in publication. I'd strongly suggest photocopying individual songs as page-turning while playing can easily result in tears. The backside of the page being copied may show through a little due to the thinness of the paper, but it doesn't interfere with playablity, in my opinion."
4,Great for a rainy summer afternoon,"I fell on Country of the Pointed Firs by Jewett wholly by accident while perusing the library shelves. Being a stodgy, older white guy I could have easily passed this one up.While I consider myself fairly well-read I had never heard of Sarah Orne Jewett.She was a very percetive and observant journalist. Sociologists and historians should be pleased that her careful recordings of everyday life remain. Feminists should be especially pleased that the life, aspirations and dreams of everday women survive from an era dominated by male writers.I bought this wonderful Library of America edition to keep at my cabin, right next to Thoureau's Walden and Kingsolver' Prodigal Summer."
1,Very dry,There was absolutely no solution in the pen. This product was a complete waste of time. I wouldn't recommend it to my worst enemy.
4,"Handy Item, but could use a couple of changes.","This is a handy item with multiple uses. It would be even better with a couple of improvements.Pros:- Extra snap-close storage containers for small items.- Clip on front is easy to use and seems well-made.Cons:- Huge. This thing is large, mostly due to the large handle added-on to the side. It is much bigger than I imagined it would be.- Latches and closures on the compartments seem quite flimsy and will likely wear out before too much usage.All things considered, a good product. Our sons (5th and 3rd grade) wanted one to replace their backpacks. They are a bit nerdy and I suppose this fits the profile. I use one to carry around notes and documents needed for a writing project. Works well....but huge."
2,Office Portable Clipboard Storage Case,"Good idea but poorly executed. The two pockets on either side of handle are only large enough for paper clips. If slightly larger they would accommodate business cards. Inside, the pockets for papers are so tight putting a sheet of paper in this is difficult. It would be nice to have a divider for pen/pencil. When closing if top and bottom are not perfectly aligned, they do not close.Handle and low profile outer clip are good ideas. Constructed of plastic with rounded corners, the unit is less harmful to furniture than aluminium."
2,overpriced,"This item is clunky plastic. I think you could probably find it cheaper elsewhere. Or, perhaps you could find something that is better quality. I wanted to use it to hold my knitting/crochet patterns and related accessories while I worked on a project. But, it's too big to carry around."
5,gift,Bought this as a gift for my sister who's a nurse. She loved it! She felt it was large enough to cary her essential items and durable.
3,"Too many details, but powerful.","Set on a Louisiana sugarcane plantation in the 1970's, AGathering of Old Men is a powerful depiction about race relations andracial tensions arising in the south. When a white man named Beau Boutan is murdered, eighteen old black men come together to do something they have never done before, stand up for themselves. The book tells, in detail, 15 different narrators' point of views of how this whole episode went down. This book is a good example of race relations in the south, and can be related to other situations in other places, even if it's not the exact same situation. To me this book is a very detailed, powerful book, but because of all it's details the book goes by very slow, and sometimes begins to get very boring. The book could have been told with only one or two narrators in only a few chapters. I would recommend this book to anyone who has the time and patience to sit down, read the book, and try to fully understand it. END"
3,A Changing of Age,"A Gathering of Old Men was assinged to me by my 10th grade literatere teacher. I did not think it was going to be that good but it turned out to be good. I tought it was good of the author not to take a side. I would have never have thought it would have been Charlie since he did let everybody hit him. But that day he changed Beau was there. So Charlie took it out on him. Gil,Beau's brother,Fix's son also changed of age. He stood up to his father. I think the author should have told more about the whites. The end ended good with one of the whites and one of the blacks dead. Many people thought it was about rascism but a don't because it shows favor to both the whites and the blacks."
3,Discussing Gathering of old men,"'The Gathering of old men' takes place on a Lousiana plantion in the the 1970's . Its somewhat of a suspenseful story , its about a murder that happens ,and instead of the usual having one suspect and everybody hates him because ""he killed him"" is definately not what happens. Everybody in this story says they did it I killed Beau it was me I shot him . But sherrif Mapes doesnt beleive anyone ,he tries to use his cop like instinct to figure this one out. Well thats all I should be telling you before I ruin the book for you ,and other than that I thought the book was rather confusing ,but other than that it was alright and thats why I gave it three stars."
2,In the end-,"While I have little backround in the works of Ernest J. Gaines, I would hope this book is not one of his best works. The only moderately good part was toward the end of the book when the killer presents him (or her) self. The large amount of charachters makes it easy to get lost, and hard to identify with each individual person. Also, the first few chapters take such a long time to develop the final scene that it makes the final chapters seem better. I say this because you are no longer forcing yourself to read through trash in hope of some spectacular ending to a mystery. The theme of racism has been done and done again in modern society leaving you wanting something more. However, another issue which presents itself, coming of age, has been written well and almost makes me think of myself and how I can become a better person. Overall I would say, if you like to read-then read it, if you don't-don't waste your time."
3,"Time, social life, and language","In the book ""A Gathering Of Old Men"" talks about the 1970's in Louisiana, in a huge sugarcane plantation, by this time the social life was very racial, and diferent than how it is now. A white men was murdered and the sheriff though it happened at the hands of a black men, but there was to many people claiming to be guilty, but the sheriff knew than only one had done it. The language used in this story is more like how blaks talk. In my personal opinion this book is a good book but its to confussing at the same time. Its a great book for people who like to read a lot of science ficcion stories."
2,old men,This story took place in louisiana. this story can kind of be rlated to maybarry on the andy griffith show. everyone is so layed back.Personaly i think this book was extremely boring. I just could'nt seem to get interested. I would'nt recomend this book to any enthousiest readers.
2,Gathering of old men,"what i thought of the book it was o.k but it was so confusing and i havent read all of it but i need to do a report and if you have read it all the way please write a summary or two to veronica_c_98901@Thank you, veronica"
1,boring book,"This book takes place in the 1970's, in a sugarcane factory in Lousiana. It takes place in a time when the blacks and the whites didnt get along. If there was a murder of a white person it was attamatically a black killer. There was alot of hatered going on between all of the people in the town.The language in this book was confusing beacuse they used words not usually used in english and that made it very confusing. They also called each other nigar which brought up a good discusin in our classroom.We noticed that we had alot of differance in opinion, some thought that it is just a word and others thought it was more. I think that this book was boring. I didn't like how it jumped from person to person. It was very confusing that is why i chose not to read it therally. I wouldn't suggest reading this book unless you enjoy to be bored. I would give this book a one because it didn't keep my interest.Don't read this, i am warning you."
4,A book to remember,This book given to me as an assignment will stay with me forever. This book displays what true friends and loved ones are all about. It also shows change is an important role in life and change can keep you safe from people who are blinded by prejudice.
3,"Characters, Characters, Characters","""A GATHERING OF OLD MEN,"" a book written by Ernest J. Gaines is an inspiring story about race problems in 1960 Luisiana. The book about the unatural death of a white overseer. By the hands of an unknown black citizen of the parish owned by a young white woman, Candy. Candy, being raised by the people in the parish, rounded up as many of the old black men who all where glad to take the credit. But as our story unfolded a long list of characters with numerous backgrounds came into play. I particularly liked that the whole story was narrated by a different person each chapter, thus giving you many points of view. Well, for the record I am a Sophmore student at JCHS and was required by my 10th grade Lit teacher to read the book.Zack Buda"
3,A Gathering of Old Men,"Ernest Gaines's novel, A Gathering of Old Men, is an excellent and inspiring story. Gaines did a great job at bringing his audience right into the action by his skillful use of description. Ernest could have, however, changed the surroundings more often. A huge portion of the book stayed in the same setting. Often, Gaines used predictable routines of the characters. These minor flaws can make the reader bored from the lack of change. The characters were easily predictable at times, but sometimes Gaines would throw in a few surprises. Ernest did an excellent job of making up for his mistakes by making his readers anticipate what will happen next, but unexpectedly, he changes the story into a whole new direction. Despite the small imperfections, overall, the novel was interesting and unique."
3,"A good book, but a slow one as well","This book was an excellent piece of literature. The fact is, however, 2 chapters would have sufficed. It's story is exaggerated through pages and pages ...where really the story can be told in 30 pages. However, the point is well taken. Racism and prejudice are vividly described and elaborated on to make you ask the question ""why"".. and ""how""."
3,I think the end could have been better.,The book was preetty good over all but the end should have been a little better
3,The Discussion of Gathring of Old Men,The Gathering of Old Men is a story that takes place in Lousiana in 1970. It is in a small down town . During this time era there was still racial conflict amoung the white and black communities. One day when a white man in the town is killed named Beau they automatically blame it on a black man. They blame it on an old man Mathu because he was the only one at the scene and he had a shot gun. So all of the old black men in the community go to Mathu's house with shot guns and they don't know who did it. The old men had confused everyone in the town. It ended up being Charlie one of the old men. It is good book because each charcter has symbolic meaning.I wouldn't normally read a book like this one but I thought it was a good a really good book and is very educational.
2,A gathering of old men,"A Gathering of Old Men is a good book to read if you like reading an entire book on one single day. I found the book pretty boring. I feel you only need about three chapters to write about one day. The book was long and drawn out. The only thing that made it somewhat interesting was the descriptions of the people and using different narrators. It does a great job of giving reference to southern racism and problems with land, money, and people. The way the book is written you can't tell if the author is black or white, male or female in that sense it's a real good book but you have to have a lot of time and patience. You would also have to be a young adult or an adult to understand most of the meaning, words etc... It has a lot of profanity and other inappropriate stuff in it for young children. The content of the book is mostly rated PG 13 but it slips up to R every once and awhile. Other than that it was an ok book that I would only recommend to older people."
1,Don't bother,"So bad. Just because it is a low budget movie does not mean the acting, authenticity, camera work, and basically everything else about it has to be bad. I usually respect low budget movies if the can at least tell a good story. I made better movies for high school classes, and I am not even saying those were good. It was like people busted out their old home video cameras, wrote a script that is nothing like what happened in Vietnam (dialog, apparel,meat heads, fat guys... and no black guys?), and over acted while filming themselves. Then they thought, ""we don't need to watch it to see if it is good we just know it is."" I would say it is a good one to watch as a joke, but it just hurts to watch....physically painful."
3,Bluestem beats the blues,I liked reading this book. It was really exciting and I could picture myself as one of the characters. I especially liked the part where their father came home but I think it would have been a better book if it didn't end so easily.
4,You gotta read my review,The Snowman and all that crap wasn't that bad. It wasn't Stine's best!!!!! I really don't suggest to read it!!
2,This was not your best Mr. Stine!,"This book was so incredibly dull! The plot was ok, but the end, come on, i know you can do much better Mr. Stine. I know plots are probably getting harder to think of, but this could've been good. Nice try Mr.Stine, but try harder next time.---- Ivy Lukes ""Book Review"""
1,I CANNOT Belive this book.,"This book was not up to RL Stines normal way of doing things. Was this supposed to be scary? No! The Abombinal Snowman sort of came to Pasedna and wreaked a bit of havoc, then peacefully went back to the mountains. This was pitiful. There was absoulutely no action whatsoever, and the story was so horrible. The DEFINATELY did not meet my expectations."
4,Interesting,"I'll say that although these books have funny and awkward endings,they are still interesting and have a strange twist in the end.R.L stine,Good Luck!"
3,DOES NOT GIVE ME GOOSEBUMPS,"This book was okay. It was a really sad plot and what happened to the pictures he took of it and what happened to Kara? I didn't like this book as much as the others. (Why don't you jump on over to R. L. Stines other book: ""The Warewolf of Fever Swamp"". (A young) reader from New Hampshire)"
4,Snow adventures,"Jordan and Nicole live in Pasadena. It's hot and they dream of snow. They are over the moon when their father is going to Alaska on an assignment and they get to tag along. Their father is a photographer and his new task is to prove the existence of the abominable snowman. Their guide is terrified of the snowman, but surely there can be no such thing as an abominable snowman?Another nice Stine-book."
3,It was ok it could have been better,I liked it but there were parts that just made no sense. I think it was a book that you can read if you have nothing better to do on a long trip somwhere far.
1,How this book is so boring !,This book is so boring because of how dumb it is. Also i thought that this book is so boring because it mostly talks about the characters and it does not talk about the storie and those are my thoughts about the storie.
3,An Early and Modest Exhibition Catalog,"John Henry Twachtman is the title of an exhibition catalog for a show at the Cincinnati Art Museum, located in the artist's home town. Twachtman is one of the major names in American Impressionism, but the rehabilitation of these artists was a gradual process and this catalog, which dates back to 1966, was one of the early steps in this process. Thus it is a modest effort, only forty-one pages and the reproductions are black & white. The introduction by Richard Boyle, one of the great authorities on Twachtman and American Impressionism, is well-written but short, but the painting descriptions may be of scholarly interest. This is probably not a catalog for anyone other than the scholar or enthusiast who has to have everything on this ""painter's painter."""
3,Buy it ONLY if you are taking the exam,"Pros- By working out and understanding the reasoning behind each question in this book, you will do ""well"" on the Zend Certification Exam.- Excellent questions, many tricky qwerks about PHP is explained.Cons- The book has errors that will confuse you for hours and the authors are not too responsive in taking care of it. [...]Note- This book was not designed to teach, please don't expect to be taught PHP through this book."
1,garbage,The previous reviewer was too generous. The numerous flaws in the book were so offputting that I finally gave up in disgust and discarded the book. One might expect that a book which asserts to prepare you for any exam would be proofread especially carefully. It appears that the only proofreading was just of simple grammar. Nothing on the logic or accuracy of what was actually written.I strongly urge you to look for another text. Don't waste your time with this one.
1,"Old, Outdated, Not well written","Just not a good piece of scholarship. If it ever had value, its value is limited at best at this time."
2,Good Facts... Too much rhetoric,"I've read Michael Scarce's work before, I've worked with him in a professional capacity, and I can understand how his personality translates to the text of this book. I feel the facts and stories that are given are very crucial to the content of the book, but I also feel very strongly that the rhetorical nature of the book detracts from it. It is one thing to add meaning to stories and statistics through explanation; quite another to inflame it with dogma."
5,Pure Enchantment!,"This cookbook is pure enchantment and delight! The recipes are fresh, flavorful, classy, and easy to prepare. The photos are a work of art and everytime I browse through this treasure I am inspired to create wonderful meals and snacks for my family and friends. I own many cookbooks, but this is one of my favorites. I made the Banoffi Pie for my daughter's birthday party and it was a hit! The grown-ups and the children all loved it. I highly recommend this cookbook to anyone who enjoys cooking beautiful, irresistable food."
5,Pity It's Only Remixed,"This album was actually Deni's second Australian album, the first being the sublime 'Imagination'. 'Remix' is a gorgeous album with some great new tracks and remixes by the worlds best, but if you can get a hold of 'Imagination' buy both!"
5,Schlage lock,"I must start with thanking Amazon and DHL for dealing with customs. The lock was like one i already have for 15 years, like expected. A bit more detailed info in amazon webpage for not so experienced user as i am would be useful.Zimex"
5,Best book for brothers!!,"I bought this book when I was pregnant with my second son. By the time my older son was 2 1/2, he was reading it to his one year-old brother by memory!! The pages have been taped and retaped, they are so well-read!! The illustrations are exquisite! The story is beautiful!! What a sweet, sweet story that celebrates the love between two brothers!"
2,The Pci Handbook,"This is a shirt pocket book with only bare specifications. As a reference source for someone who already fully understands the bus it is great. For someone looking to learn the bus, a book like ""PCI System Architecture"" would be better."
4,A Detective Story for Vermeer Lovers,"This treasure is actually a mystery novel in the guise of an art book! Steadman cleverly examines the long-held debate over Vermeer's alleged use of camera-like inventions to help create his masterworks. He does so by constructing models of the rooms, examining long-overlooked clues and engaging in some very pragmatic thinking. At times Steadman almost comes across as art history's answer to Lt. Colombo, which is a compliment. This is a very readable and enjoyable book for any art lover who also loves a good mystery, brain teasers, and practical application of optics. My only quibble is that additional illustrations and plates would have helped Steadman make his point better."
2,Isn't He Supposed to Prove a Point?,"In this novel, Philip Steadman dives into the world of the artist Johannes Vermeer and seeks to prove that he did in fact use some type of camera apparatus. His book goes into a great deal of detail as to the history of the techniques and methods, but fails in my opinion in a major way. Steadman failed to actually make a steadfast argument. He used a great deal of examples that may definitely point to Vermeer's use, but he constantly contradicts himself later by saying that it is quite possible otherwise because of this, that, and the other. In the end I was left saying, ""Well did he or freakin' didn't he?"" Arguably it is nice to have to think about these answers after reading a book, but the title says, ""Uncovering the Truth Behind the Masterpieces."" In my opinion Steadman didn't uncover anything, but only opened up unbacked opinions and no concrete evidence. It was more of a ""this is why 'I' think he did it."""
1,If i had received the item i can advice about it..................,.........about this one and about all the others i ordered i pay and still waiting since December.One thing i can advice don't order anything unlessyou use Express mail
4,I LIKE IT,I bought two sets of these. One for me and one for my daughter. We both like them. They seem to stay in your ears a little better than some of the other ones we have tried. I would recommend them.
2,Not as good as others for same price,"I bought these at the same time as a pair of Sony MDR-E828LP and TDK BP100s. These JVCs are the worst of the 3, and they're all just under $10.The Sony's are the best of the 3 from a sound quality point of view, and the TDK's sound is in between, and they happen to fit my ears the best."
3,"Great sound, but poor fit for small ears.","I have small ears and tried many different kinds of earbuds with similar results. I must admit that these have the best sound quality for the price range. I listen to mostly classical and jazz music which has a wide acoustic instrument range. They sound very clear on my Sandisk mp3 player--especially during soft passages. Bass is adequate for something so light and small as these. Though the sound quality is good for the price I still gave them three stars because they always fall out of my ears--whether I'm laying in bed or walking down the street. It's annoying! I thought the material would be softer, stickier, and more flexible than it actually was. They do appear more durable than other buds I've tried. If they were designed to be just a bit smaller they might be the perfect buds for me. I also like the idea of the colors. I bought the blue pair which matches my Sandisk player. Other colors available include pink, white, lime green, and black."
3,Nice Sound for price,I am satisfied with my new headphones. They're are very convenient in the workplace as well as my iPOD. Nice clear sound and nice length on with the connection wire.
1,Waste Of Money,"I bought these to replace some terrible Sony earbuds and these are even worse than those.1. Sound quality is terrible. Bass is decent, but the treble is completely muffled.2. They do fit pretty well.3. The cord seems flimsy.I'm going to search again for better earbuds....."
2,"If you are going to buy this, buy an inexpensive used copy","The book begins with a lot of promise. There is plenty of murder and mystery within the first few pages. However, the story quickly turns downhill when the protagonist is introduced. Her misguided loyalties and selfish ambitions are enough to annoy the reader and overshadow the other events and characters in the book."
1,I wish they would have told me that it contains lead...,"I admit that it is my fault for not reading the 1 star reviews of this product before buying it. If I would have read them, I would have noticed that they both say that this product contains lead, and I wouldn't have purchased it. However, I DID read the entire product description, and not a word of it containing lead was mentioned. So when it arrived at my apartment and I read the warning on the back of the packaging, I was disappointed. I know it only costs $3, so it's not a big loss or anything, but it seems like something that they should mention. Hopefully leaving this review will get the company to add the same warning to the product description that is already on the packaging."
3,Pretty solid,"I've used a different tape measure for my waist for years, and it recently broke. I picked this one up, and though it works, it seemed to stretch a little bit too much and might be better served for regular measuring as opposed to my weekly bf measurements."
5,The perfect tape measure!,This is just what I was looking for! I looked at every local store for a tape measure and couldn't find one like this. I was very happy to see it on Amazon.
3,Its an Ok little cd,"Its good, i guess. You can tell Coal Chamber is beginning to lose a little. Theyre still good, and they put on a great live show...but...i guess they couldnt top their self titled. It was too good. Its good - not 10.99 good - but good"
1,Uncomfortable,I am a bit disappointed. The slipper is not very comfortable. The leather is not very soft. The left foot burns my little toe.
1,Unaware,"Obviously written by someone who never explored her own feelings and who never came within miles of a sensitivity training session. I can only hope that in the 36 years since she wrote this book that maybe she has. As for her quote of my teacher Jack Gibb (p. 90), who was the most gentle and loving person I have ever known, I believe she got it exactly backwards of what Jack believed and taught. He and others who run sensitivity training groups (now often called by many other names: teambuilding, encounter groups, awareness training, staff development, T-groups, group dynamics, and numerous trade names) feel that human nature is good--or at least neutral--not evil, but unfortunately those who tend to rise to the top in government are not the cream but the pond scum."
2,More for Kicks,"As stated in the description and previous reviews, this book is simple and straigthforward. There are a few good ideas here for coping with work-stress issues but nothing earth-shakingly profound that will help you uncover the reasons for your misery or the routes to contentment. If you're seriously looking to jump ship, switch careers or reinvent your life, this book is more comic relief and than serious research."
4,Information security or Information operations? That is the question!,"Is it information security or information operations?It is quite clear that we are looking at the two sides of the same coin. Increasing your own security is a defensive measure. Decreasing the security of your opponent is an offensive measure. You need both!The book provides the expected introduction to the offensive side of information security. The discussed issues introduce the concept of how information is used as a force multiplier. The proliferation of information flow, outside the world governments, put these governments on the defensive rather on the offensive side. The long reaction time of a typical government aggravates this situation. The book cleverly furnishes the reasons and some of the means to develop the capabilities of information operations as a weapon and as a multiplier of force in the near and foreseen future."
4,great development,"I think that it is a great book, for all those geographers or of other diciplines interested in the space aspects, the ones that are in this book in a very good fundamental argument about the development of the term space production and the factors that influence in the unequal production in a capitalist system"
2,It is ok but,"I expected this turn table to be used on the table, but it is cheap looking and comes apart when you pick it up. The rollers are a seperate piece. It also doesn't turn evenly, kind of wobbles. Not good. Spend more money and get a better one."
5,Omega Zip,"Omega Zip are very good.. They last for many years. There is a good amount of storage space also for important documents, pictures, etc."
1,ZIp discs,"Something is wrong with it, I cannot format it, I am very unhappy with purchase, glad it was only 1 piece."
1,they suck,"To be frank these speakers sucks! Don't even try to use them in a normal house or even in a large basement the sound is all highs due to the folded horns. The bass well thats another story so much that the movie theater had to remove them. We could not use them, our unit with dbx 400 watt amp and pre- amp could not tone down the bass and treb. Enough for the movie. Now in a five hundred seat theater sounded bad try in a very large basement."
2,Failed after 7 weeks of heavy use...,"My drive failed after 7 weeks of pretty heavy use. It sounded like the actuator arm was broken(heavy clicking with complete drive failure upon bootup). There had been no major shocks or injuries to the laptop that contained the drive and no other plausible explanation for the failure. I'm now on #2 and I hope that my first experience was just a fluke. However, I'm forced to give only 2 stars based on my 2 month experience with the drive so far.I will say that other than the drive failure, the performance has been very good. There's some mild clicking that can be heard from the hard drive when in use, but its fairly mild when compared to other 2.5 internals."
1,Don't Buy This Drive,Placed this drive in my notebook and it failed after 3 days of use. Lucky that I had a clone made by ez-gig. I have found other comments on internet about the failure of this drive ... Just say NO!
2,Save your money.,"This camera sounds good in specs, but the pictures are what you'd expect from an inexpensive digital camera. The colors are washed out, and the images are poor quality. Spend a little more money and get a betterr camera."
2,Art of Appreciation Basket tries to do it on the cheap,"Ordered this for my son in law and his 3 boys and it shipped and arrived on schedule. Was pleased to get it at a sale price but didn't realize that meant at least part of the food items were out of date. This was shipped out and received as of April 6 2012 but as the wrapper for the included football cookies indicates it was to be sold by March 12, 2012."
4,So far an insightful book,We're only a few chapters in but I think she has a nice writing style and really encourages you to think positively about your relationship.
5,I can't believe my husband enjoyed it with me.,"While on a long car trip, my husband notice me reading Barbara Barlein's Why Did I Marry You Anyway? To help pass the time, he suggested I read it aloud. I was amazed at his interest and his desire for me to stop and discuss passages with him. He even stated that he was getting a lot out of it. Many issues we had never discussed came to the fore and were patiently worked out. I was very impressed, not only with the material presented in this book, but in the fun way it was presented and the ease that it could be used as a basis for good discussion."
5,This game rocks!,I've had this game for years and I've finally figured out how to get all the Star Drops. People say this game is easy but once you get to King Dedede and Dark Matter you'll quickly change your opinion on it! Great for people who love Kirby and those looking for an easy/hard game.
5,"Can you say, terrific?!","This game is great! Play as Kirby in an all new world compared to the old one. It has so much adventure that once you get it and start playing, you'll nver want to stop.If you ask me, i'd say,""GET IT!!"""
5,my favorite album,"i gave away this CD to a friend who I know will appreciate it, came online to buy another. I find the combination of imaginative, deeply evocative lyrics with the satisfying, varied sound to ""wear well."" I've listened to the CD many, many times and never tire of it, new details and connections keep emerging. I saw this band once in Berkeley, and they sound even better in person, excellent musicians. I especially love the last song on the CD, ""Day to Night"", with its beautiful summation at the end,balances much of the punk nihilism of some of the rest of the lyrics and suggests resolution of the theme (bitter breakups) of the rest of the album. Hate to see this group disband, I hope they regroup in some way, especially since each of their previous albums offer a distinct style-probably they have lots more creativity where that came from."
5,hmmm...,"the cd was a big change for me. i normally listen to poppy hip-hop or even sometimes a little alternitive, but my friend made me listen to this and i fell in love. i bought the cd about a week later and i love it. its so intense and engaging and i would recommend it to anyone who loves good punk i guess."
3,"different, but not that bad...","i know i will get called a 'poser,' but this is actually pretty good. it's a huge departure from the first two amsteel albums, but good in it's own manner. their first album on new disorder (which i think is now out of print) is absolutely incredible...sounds like what the 'life won't wait' era rancid would sound like if rancid played it right...a cross of incredibly gruff punk rock with glass-sharred vocals and hints of ska. this is just really laid back, almost alternative, but 'there's a new life' sounds exactly like their older stuff. unfortunately, ruairi's voice isn't half as rough as before."
1,"Jumbled, error-filled attempt at ""shock""-tabloid style.","Yet another by-the-numbers effort (or lack of such) that attempts to provide an all-round view of Satanism and alleged crimes committed in the name thereof. The content of this book is sadly lacking -- much of the data long outdated, and it seems that the author has just thrown in any old thing into it that bears even the most tenuous link to ""Satanism"" or the ""Occult"" (e.g. the Ku Klux Klan were neither!). This 400+ page volume has no practical value for anyone wishing to learn anything of significance about either Satanism or the occult -- rather it is a collection of jumbled entries evidently trying to focus mainly on the more ""shocking"" elements of juvenile devil-worship and neo-pagan or esoteric societies (much of it inaccurate). Serious readers should avoid this turkey like the plague."
3,Good for children under 12,"I bought this one on a recommendation from a friend who knows I'm a big fan of fairy tales, but I was bit disappointed in the finished product. The art is pretty but not original. And the writing is a bit long for younger readers. This is probably ideally suited to children of ten or so."
4,Keeps the tea piping hot,"The 20 ounce pot is the perfect size for two generous mugs of tea. The loose stainless-steel lid gets a bit hot to the touch, so you have to remember to hold it in place with a tea towel while pouring. However, I can overlook this flaw due to the pot's great insulation- the tea develops nicely (especially a dark, rich breakfast tea) and will stay warm for a good half an hour. Looks great too, great colors and very easy to clean."
5,Works great - had a few problems to start,"I have the Floodstop Washing Machine Valve Shutoff Kit and Furman MP-20 Power Relay Accessory as described by R. Savage. Initially I got the Floodstop Washing Machine Valve Shutoff Kit and let it sit in the box for a few months, the washer hookups were not ready. When I finally got everything set up it did not work on battery power. I contacted OnSite PRO and they sent me a new unit even though it was months after I purchased the shutoff kit. No hassle, very easy.The units do work well. The washing machine I have does leak a bit from the drain and the units turn everything off then this occurs."
3,Poor Quality,"I installed this item and the first time I tested it, it broke. The basic construction is bullet proof except for a small plastic gear that connects the motor to a ball valve. The gear broke between the motor shaft and the teeth. The company immediately sent a replacement gear which was easy enough to replace. I was surprised to see a cheap fragil part, which turns out to be the weak link, in a valve that appears to be constructed of quality parts."
5,So far so good,"Fortunately this product has not been ""field tested"" in my house (hopefully it never will), but it does provide me with the comfort of knowing it is in place in case something does happen. Easy to install and worked great when I tested it with a bit of water. A good investment!"
5,So far so good,Installation was simple as was the testing after install. I'm hoping that I never find out whether this product lives up to it's name but I'm confident that it will do it's job it when and if I ever need it.
4,Not sure what to think yet....,"Ok, so I just got this book and haven't finished it but I want to add a review hoping to see more people add their reviews. The reason I got this book is because I had finished 4 of 6 tests (MCSE NT4) and didn't plan on finishing them after I got into a bad skiing accident and microsoft announced that they were expiring the certification in Dec. Well, now that they are lifting the expiration, I'm going to give the Accelerated Exam a shot. I'm not going to make the time for one of the 1500 page books so I'm simply using this book and the free 240 page study from cramsession.So finally, my review: the author adds a humor that is sometimes annoying but other times amusing. I read sixty pages last night and counted probably 4 or 5 grammatical errors. Usually doesn't matter but c'mon, there's no excuse for errors in these books. The author has the certification experience behind him so I'm going to trust him. He seems to hit most of the main points. We'll see!"
4,Good fighting game,"This is the perfect fighting game for someone who don't get the gameboy color and can't afford it and Street Fighter Alpha (color only). I have only two complaints about that game... the animation is quite choppy, there aren't enough frames of animation and there's two missing charaters, Vega and E. Honda (Honda I don't care much for him). But it's a good buying overall."
3,Not a very useful book for the complete perspective,"This book focusses on the ""human"" side of building organizational capabilities. It is a pretty good treatise of how HR and individual development can be used to achieve competetive advantage. The model for competitive advantage given in the book makes interesting reading. But the biggest drawback of the book is the lack of illustrative examples. There are hardly any useful cases. In addition there could have been some focus on value chain activites and how organizational capability responds to that. The book also doesnot focus at all on some of key components of capability like technology, time etc. There is also no clear model/ process given which shows the transition of capabilities to competencies. The emphasis of the book also seems to be how to build organizational capabilty - there are really no clues provided about how strategy should be shaped by capablity."
1,Poor performance,"This perfume was ordered as a present for my wife. When it came in, in timely fashion, she was pleased.When she opened the bottle and put it on--there was no smell after 10 minutes.She wore it for a second time with the same result!When i cointacted the vendor I was ignored.Amazon explained the policy was of no return if the bottle was opened. How do you wear perfume or cologne without using it?Amazon was very ngood about my problem, but the vendor was not.Suggestion--do not buy from this vendor--they are unreliable and violate the cannons of good business."
1,waste of money,"a gift to my wife,she choose this,and thought its a good buy,since she have been using this for many years,well one of the many perf she owns,and seeing how cheap it is here,she thought shes getting a better deal,she just used it today,and she knows it is not the same things she used,she said the scent is musk,not sweet anymore,i believe her even if i dont know the scent cause she used it,and was one of her favorite perf.. i cannot return this anymore,cause she's at the phillipines.. just very disappointing,i will not buy perfume again from here..i hope amazon would be more careful where they get their supply."
2,Disappointing,"I expected much more from the Smithsonian. This book does not include many of the opaque minerals which are used in jewelry, such as Sujalite, a beautiful, purple mineral.How are we to expand our knowledge, if the Smithsonian is not willing to think outside the box?"
4,********* READ THIS HONEST REVIEW **********,"Let's take a look at the value here in this book and overall what I'd rate it. First the packaging...simply placed in a box with air bags around it so when I opened it up all was well...no issues. That was easy! Now the review of the book: Simple with lots of pictures YET, you could read a little deeper and they have everything from a world map and which gems come from where, as well as breakdowns of different clarities of many gems. Overall value: I suppose it was okay. Nothing over the top here, although admittedly I'm difficult to say it's perfect. The book is a little thinner than I expected, but that doesn't mean it doesn't have enough pertinent information listed. Overall I rate this book a B and it's only held back because it wasn't as big as I'd like to have seen and that it could have had even more pictures. Fair product for the money - a little higher than what I would place the value to be. I think this is more of a $9.99 book personally."
5,Gemstones Handbook,Great Book...full of useful information. The pictures really give you an indepth but brief description of the item discussed. This book is absolutely essential to the amature hobby collectors out there.
4,Taoist Principles for Everybody,"It's not every day you see a book on any Eastern philosophy that is easily accessible by pretty much anybody who can read. With /Zhuangzi Speaks/, Tsai Chih Chung has given us a great gift. I must admit that I initially had low expectations for a cartoon version of Chuang-Tzu's writings. After having read through it, however, I say with confidence that this is truly a wonderful book that makes the sometimes puzzling Taoist principles much easier to understand./Zhuangzi Speaks/ is definitely worth a read by fledgling and long-time Taoists alike, as well as their loved ones (who may not understand much about the Tao), and anyone else who is even the least bit curious about Chuang-Tzu and his ideas."
4,Worked OK with Vista Home Premium 32 bit,I had the Hauppauge 1600 working fine with Windows XP. I recently switched to Vista Home Premium in a new computer.Vista recognized the card itself and installed a driver from Windows Update. It then worked with Windows Media Center with no other action on my part.This card works well for me. My only wish would be for better Linux support.
2,To use or not to use,Purchased WinTV to do HD recording into computer. With good signal from off-the-air antenna the Hauppauge would only find about half of the HD channels when it scanned.I deemed it too much trouble to use and went with HD on Dishnetwork and a 722 DVR. Works excellent.Just hope Hauppage comes through with the $20 rebate.
3,Hauppauge WinTV HVR-1600 (Vista Premium),"Card and software installation was fine, under Vista Ultimate 64-bit. However, the WinTV application just doesn't work well under Vista--I have 4GB of fast RAM and a GeForce 8800GTX--the fastest card you can buy today. Half the time, I get no picture or sound, 40 percent of the time, picture and sound are jerky. Ten percent of the time, everything is great--but don't even think of multitasking.Coming out of sleep mode or hibernation, WinTV2K simply WILL NOT WORK: A system reboot is required.I much preferred my WinTV USB2 PVR to this card; however, my USB2 PVR isn't supported under Vista64."
2,"Played live TV (kind of), but didn't record","I was able to get the live TV functionality to work using the included software, however anytime I tried to do anything with recording, the application completely froze up. It is advertised to work with Windows Vista, but I am not convinced that is the case. Even installing updated drivers from their Website didn't do the trick. The card didn't seem to work at all with Media Center either; I was able to get live TV for a while through Media Center, but after that I got nothing.Aside from these problems, the card itself seemed pretty limited, with not much in the way of input connectors. The picture with live TV was also quite fuzzy when put in full screen mode. I wouldn't recommend this card."
2,Simpy not impressed,"maybe Windows 7 will help this unit function better. One can hope...I have this unit tied into a new Samsung B750, the judder it creates running in Media Center is incredable. Thankfully I have a Homerun HD which proves the hauppauge just does not cut it.UPDATE 11/23/09 - Now have Windows 7 64 bit and can tune Clear QAM signals. It is better (Comcast Cable feed) and sees a lot more channels and HD channels as well. No big judder effects on recorded sports. Still the Silicondust HDhomerun has a better quality signal. But we may have to change to Ceton if Comcast encripts their signals as is being reported."
5,Perfection!,"This card has two tuners - NTSC and ATSC - and BOTH work at the same time in Vista MCE. I have two of these babies in our MCE box and can record four shows (two HD and two SD) at the same time now. Overkill? Yes, but for once, someone made a card that actually can do it and work like it is supposed too!It's a shame they don't come with an antennae like the HDTV Wonder used too - picture quality is same as any other HD tuner, and I'm happy with the signal of the SD as well.Stunning results for such a cheaply priced card. I should warn that I use the standard Microsoft remote with Vista's MCE - so I haven't played with the extra features that this card offers (remote and such) - and I have NOT used the software that comes with, as Vista's MCE does more than I need.Beautiful."
2,Useless to me.,"Video was choppy with the bundled software and fell out of sync with audio when using DScaler. Running the uninstaller has somehow disabled DVD playback on my computer. Others seem to have better luck with this product, but it was a complete waste of money for me."
1,Poor Tuning Quality,i bought this with the thought of having a higher quality tuner card for DVR purposes. I already have a $20 Sabrent that i use for broadcasting to pick up the signal from the internet. The Sabrent actually blows this tuner away. For some reason the Hauppauge does not have the power to convert as clean a signal as the $20 Sabrent. I will be returning this item.
3,"The hardware is great, but the software is terrible","I stopped using the software the day I bought it, the timeshift and the scheduling of recordings was a pain. It took several passes of configuration to get the drivers correct and for it to see the HD channels. I found WatchHDTV (I am not associated with the product) and use it all the time."
1,installation issues,I have been unable to install on Vista Ultimate 64 bit. Help desk helpful but may have to return.
2,The Record feature doesn't work in Vista,"Beware buying any Hauppauge product for Windows Vista. Everything works except for Record, which crashes. The hardware may be good, but the software/driver seems to have been an afterthought."
3,A good idea,"I installed this device into a airly powerful desktop with plenty of RAM and a 256 Mb Video card. The images were ok, a little jerky, but not really watchable. This may, however, be more user error than hardware quality..."
3,Item is just what needed to top the cake for a Pokemon Birthday Party,"Item completed the cake for a Pokemon Birthday Party. And, afterwards is now a great item to play with.Seller was very quick in expediting the order...during the holidays mind you.Thank you!"
4,"Of course it's not ""Devil in the White City""...","...but why would we want it to be?Larson has given us another well written, meticulously researched historical crime story. The crime is not as sensational or as mind-boggling in its scope Holmes' house in Chicago, and that may be where folks are finding this to be a lesser book. Crippen is not so much a villain as he is a different type of victim. But the spectacle of his flight from justice and eventual capture couldn't have happened in a world before Marconi and his invention. That invention is so game-changing, it's hard, as a citizen of the 21st century, to imagine how wireless communication must have been received by the citizens of the 19th. Larsen's gift is his ability to convey that wonder and connecting it to something we can relate to regardless of what age we live in - murder."
4,Interesting read,"I bought this book because I loved ""Devil in the White City."" ""Thunderstruck"" is written basically the same with an historic event coinciding with a murder. Larson certainly did a lot of research and while I found this book loaded with the inside scoop on Marconi and the race for wireless telegraph, the murder case was not as thrilling as from his prior book. I look forward to reading ""Isaac's Storm""."
5,Proof that non-fiction can be more interesting than fiction,The tales of Crippen and Marconi touch each other at one point and the entire book builds up to it in a way that any thriller writer would be proud of. The only quibble I have was there wasn't even more about the technology itself.
4,Another Thriller from Larson,"I have now read three books by Erik Larson and all of them have been terrific. Issac's Storm and the Devil in the White City were wonderfully researched and written and his latest hit, Thunderstruck, continues the tradition. The book, which is non-fiction, meshes the struggles of Marconi to discover the ""wireless"" and a murder suspect in England. He does a great job of bringing the two stories together in a seamless fashion. He provides such atmosphere that you think you are there watching the events unfold. I won't give away much of the story but this is a book that brings together all the best elements of historical research, true crime, the spirit of invention and all the passion of the early 20th century. Anyone who appreciated either of Larson's other efforts is bound to enjoy this fast paced adventure."
2,"Disappointing - This is no ""Devil in the White City""","Don't buy this book thinking it will be as good as Larson's ""Devil in the White City."" It's not. I was bored to death for the first 80 pages, at one time thinking I wouldn't even finish the book. Finally the pace picked up a little bit, but the Crippen murder storyline is nothing like the one in ""Devil."" It's predictable, not enthralling. The Marconi story is interesting from a historical perspective, but doesn't match the 1893 Columbian Exposition storyline in ""Devil."" Bottom line: ""Thunderstruck"" does not come close to ""Devil in the White City."""
4,Another Larson Marvel,"I had the great pleasure of meeting Erik Larson about a week before I started reading Thunderstruck, which made me appreciate this book even more.Like ""Devil in the White City"", this book combines history and intrigue. But where ""Devil"" seemed bogged down with details and a vast array of characters, this book was much less tedious. In ""Devil,"" the magic was the White City and all that went into its creation. Thunderstruck's magic is in the invention of the wireless. It, too parallels the genius behind the creator, while also following the story of a diabolical killer.But enough comparisons. If you want a good book filled with history, science, and mystery, pick up Thunderstruck and enjoy the charm of Larson's writing."
5,Good Book,A good book to read especially if you are a history buff of that era. It's a good read on a dreary winter day.
2,Little Suspense,The stories of Crippen and Marconi are disappointingly disconnected. Larson fails to achieve the suspenseful story-telling that made The Devil in the White City a hard book to put down.
3,An Electrifying Story,"I found the book a little tedious only because I learned more about Marconi's discovery and the particulars than I expected or needed. However, the parallel story was gripping and even more fascinating since the whole event was true and tragic. I am always amazed at the research done for these books. It was not an easy read for me because of the technicalities; however I did appreciate the description of Marconi's character and the many problems related to his discoveries."
3,Slow,"I loved Devil in the White City, despite having a low threshold for gruesome, so I had high hopes for this book. I just could not get into the Marconi story. Despite the (excessive) scientific detail, I never really got the message of how Marconi's contributions revolutionized the world the way the book claimed he did over and over again. The murder story was only moderately interesting and engaging. It felt like Larson was just drawing out both story lines excessively."
3,A Dissapointment,I waited weeks for Larsen's new title...expecting what I have come to expect from his works - great writing and a compelling story. By page 153 I was ready to throw the book down in frustration. Larsen's attempt to interestingly interweave the lives of Marconi (the inventor of wireless) and Crippen (a victorian era murderer) falls WAY short. The depth and detail he devotes to Marconi's tedious story only serves to derail the far more compelling story of Crippen and the murder of his wife Belle. More Crippen and less Marconi would have been much more in line with what to expect from a writer of Larsen's capabilities.
1,Borrring!,"I have not read Mr. Larsen's first book, which I understand is quite excellent. That reputation is the reason I bought this. I am unafraid of intellectual, historical novels that are well written . . . but this is exhausting. I have yet to finish the 390 page book (plus appendices and notes), but am now 280 pages into it and the plot has yet to develop. I believe there is a murder, and I believe Marconi's wonderful wireless invention will help with the murder case. But the two parallel stories of Marconi's invention and the developing murder -two separate aspects of the novel- have yet to become entwined in any manner. As a matter of fact the major part of the Marconi story is in the late 1890s into 1903 or 1904 at this point . . . and the other plot (the murder mystery) takes place mostly around 1910. As I state in the title here, this very borrring, and the plot has no momentum. A poor effort, and it seems almost formulaic if I undertstand the plot devlopment in his first book correctly."
2,Thunderstruck,"Much of this book was tedious. Found many of the Marconi portions of the story ponderous, boring. As with his ""Devil in the White City,"" just finding the factual juxtaposition of two characters (Marconi and Dr. Chippen)is a remarkable accomplishment, but other than the concluding chapters where the confluence of the two stories come together, I didn't find it an engaging tale."
5,Great read,"The pacing, depth, and literary style are much improved over Larsen's earlier effort, Devil in the White City. I couldn't put this book down. Larsen is improving with time--I can't wait for his next book."
3,Maybe 3-1/2...,"Not nearly as good as Devil in the White City which was absolutely brilliant. This book is repetitive and could have been edited down by 1/3 or more. The timelines don't synchronize, and when Crippen and Ethel Le Neve finally do flee England, the denoument comes much too quickly and their trials are passed over far too rapidly and sketchily. Still, Larson is a good writer and the stories are interesting ones. You will enjoy this one but may not be delighted."
2,Horrible...,"I've read a lot of books and generally follow other opinions and reviews; which is why I chose this title. I was very disappointed and BORED with this one. Several times I thought about tossing it but stuck it out. It was like work reading this one. I really thought it would be better, but it was more like reading a dry memoir and/or news type. Blah."
1,Thunderstruck,"Book started very, very slowly. It read like a dull documentary on the history of wireless transmissions and the ""novel"" portion of the book did not kick in until over half way through it.Mike Williams"
2,Boring,"I'm at a loss to understand so many 4 star reviews on this book! Are the 80+ positive reviewers all physics specialists or ham radio operators? If not, I'm at a loss to explain it. The tedium of the detail--not to mention the self-absorbed and unlikable Marconi--was extraoridinary. While the Crippen murder details have their appeal, the endlessssssssssssss radiography details almost melted my brain. Why, oh why, does this book entrance so many reviewers?"
2,Did not draw me in.,I could not put Devil In the White City down so when I finished it I sought other books by the same author. I simply could not get into this book. It was boring and I put it down. Don't miss it. There are too many wonderful books out there to waste time on one that was dull.
5,Another History Lesson,I like this book as much as the Devil in the White City. It is more than a history lesson since it is told as a novel with intrigue included.
4,Thunderstruck,"I've yet to read Isaac's storm, and much preferred Devil In The White City, however, Larson does not disappoint. A great read."
3,"Good, but a letdown after ""Devil in the White City""","This book starts slow and gets slower, but the final 150 or so pages is very good. I ended up liking this book, but I would definitely read Larson's other book ""Devil in the White City"" first. Now that is a great read. Thunderstruck is a good bedtime book."
4,Book Review,Read parts of this book from a book borrowed from the Library and wanted to own this book and have a copy in my personal library
4,Enjoyable - if you dig history,"Good read - his historical writing is a pleasure to read and informative. I enjoy his style and the many characters that come into the story, it give it depth. Thanks for the great book for a great price."
3,THUNDERSTRUCK,This book was Larson's worst of several EXCELLENT books. And it was GOOD!the book itself was delivered on time and in excellent shape.But read Devil in the White City first.
4,Thunderstruck,Amazing insight into the development of communication and the life and struggles of Marconi. The parallel intrigue adds flavor and variety to factual information.
4,Very Good,"Good read..I'm still enthralled by ""Murder in the White City"", so it will be hard to top that one! Anyway, recommend this mix of science and crime history."
5,Larson strikes gold again,"Following up on the success of his ""hero/villain"" style of Devil in the White City, comes this book, Thunderstruck. It's the story of the (disputed) inventor of the telegraph, and a murderer who's lives somewhat intertwine.Despite not being quite the read Devil was, Larson's writing style is still extremely engaging and Thunderstruck is a fun, interesting book. He spares no details in looking into the minds of these two different men, and strings the chapters together beautifully.Overall, not quite as good as ""Devil,"" but still a gripping read that no one should miss."
4,Thunderstruck by thunderstruck!,"Erik Larson never ceases to capture the true essence of the human race. Again, amazing accounts of history are bound in a pageturner that educates as well as enthralls."
1,Agonizing!,"I have to concur with the Publishers Weekly review. I did NOT make it to the last third of the book, I gave up after about 100 pages. I cannot believe that the murder was any more agonizing than those first 100 pages. If I wanted a history on the development of telegraphy I would have purchased one, I did not expect it to be dragged out in nitty-gritty detail in a murder story. I don't believe a history of how Marconi developed wireless could possibly contain any more detail than this book. Maybe the last third of the book should be moved to the front and then a very large appendix about the wireless could take up the back two thirds of the book."
3,Not so Thunderstruck,"Larson is the author of The Devil in the White City, a superior work to this one. The newer book traces Marconi's invention and trials with wireless telegraphy and the famous Dr. Crippen murder and flight from justice. A big problem is the timeline: Crippen kills his wife and buries parts of her in the basement so that he can be with his young lover, but Marconi's work doesn't coincide with Crippen's actions until the last few chapters of the book, when Crippen and his lover (who is disguised as a boy) take off in a ship for Canada and their actions are telegraphed back and forth between the ship's astute captain and the police captain on their tail. That part is great; the rest of Marconi's trials and many errors are rather boring after a while."
3,"rather lame compared to ""The Devil in the White City""..","Like most, I read ""Thunderstruck"" after enjoying Erik Larson's excellent ""The Devil in the White City"". I was looking for a repeat of the formula where the author chronicles to interlaced true stories: a murder mystery, and a historical event of substantial proportions. The author tries to deliver on this but comes up short. The true stories are not that compelling. The murder mystery, while gruesome, is not that complex ... nothing like the series of murders detailed in Larson's other book. And the historical event, which is actually a series of events, is not too profound either (outside the maritime world). It's basically about Marconi and his inventing of wireless ship-to-shore messaging. Of course it also formed the basis of all wireless communication, like radio broadcasts. But this came later.Bottom line: a rather tepid read. Disappointed."
3,Still good,"Perhaps I was spoiled by the incredible interweaving of stories in Devil in the White City. Thunderstruck follows that same formula but with far less attraction. That's not to say it's bad - it's not, but often a successful formula works only once and, in this case, that may well be true. Thunderstruck is tedious and riddled with boring detail of Marconi's rise to fame. All but one of the book's characters somehow lack the intreguing detail that was so provocative in Devil. Nice idea for a book, not as good as it could have been (maybe the publisher's deadline should have been pushed back? It's not good practice to rush an artist.)"
3,Interesting but somewhat BORING,"Linking Marconi and Crippen is vintage Larsen but this book tries your patience.One gets tired of Marconi pouting and building more towers while we hear, time and time again, what a nice and unassuming person Crippen is. WAY TOO MUCH BUILD UP for the CHASE PUNCH LINE.Interesting material but exceedingly overdone to, I suppose, have sufficient chapters to warrant this escapade."
5,AWESOME READ,"Ok, so I started this book not even knowing what it was about.I have just read Garden of Beast and Devil in the White City and liked them so I figured this must be decent, and man was I right! Turns out its about Marconi and a side story of a murder/mystery that you get sucked into.This is one of my favorite reads of his."
3,Did Not Live Up to Expectations,"Like others have said, I was excited to read Thunderstruck after enjoying Devil in the White City. Thunderstruck followed the same basic formula as Devil in the White City--two parallel stories, a historical event entwined with a famous murder. Unfortunately, Thunderstruck was a disappointment. The book followed the story of the inventor of wireless communications, Marconi, in parallel with the story of murderer Hawley Harvey Crippen. The connection between the two stories was too loose to make much sense, and the connection didn't become clear until the very end. The story of Marconi itself was interesting but a little too detailed. Also, the account of the Crippen murder was just not that interesting. I found Thunderstruck to be boring and was glad to be done with it."
3,Thunderstruck,"""Thunderstruck"" provides a birds eye view of Victorian London and the burgeoning era of transoceanic wireless technology. Using biography as a literary method, Larsen ties together two unrelated stories: the famous Dr Crippen, a mild mannered murderer that caught the eyes and ears of London, and the famous Marconi, the Italian dilletante inventor, who charmed British society, but angered the scientific community.The book is a bit heavy on the technology side, which unfortunately, is not as interesting a background as the rise of the city of Chicago, which Larsen described so eloquently in his earlier work, ""The Devil in the White City""."
4,A little slow to start but then rolls quickly,I am a huge Erik Larsen fan. I found the beginning of this book a little slow to start then it really picked up. I thoroughly enjoyed the build up of the murder and the capture. Amazing story with great history!
3,Gripping but wrong!,"Excellent story-telling as usual from Mr Larson but I wonder if he will be writing a new version any time soon since evidence has since come to light that a) the remains found in Crippen's basement were not those of his wife, b) DNA has proven the were in fact the remains of a man, c) there is a theory amongst criminal historians that Crippen was framed by the detectives investigating the case and d) there is evidence Belle Crippen was very much alive and well and living in Chicago at the time of her husband's execution? Hmmm."
3,"Marconi, the Inventor, and Finding a Killer at Sea Using Marconi's Wireless","I loved Erik Larson's book: ""The Devil and the White City."" I had hoped that this book would be as good. Sorry. No banana! It makes for tedious reading. It is interesting to read about Guglielmo Marconi and the fascinating process that he went though to invent and reduce to practice what was then described as the ""wireless."" We now are benficiaries of his work with radio, and its progeny. Marconi, a non scientist, pursues this with relentless determination, in the face of intense competition and scientific attacks, smacking strongly of prejudice of ""foreigners"" in Victorian England. How did a nortorious murder of a spendthift and dominerring woman influence the entire world to embrace Marconi's invention? Will Scotland Yard catch the murderer who has escaped England and is far at sea in the Atlantic Ocean heading for freedom?"
3,Not Up to Its Predecessor,"Disappointing read, after ""The Devil in the White City,"" which I enjoyed. The two strands of plot in this book, namely Marconi and the murderer Hawley Crippen, do not have enough in common, but seem stretched out in order to fit together. Either subject would make a book, but the two are not really generically entwined. Some good writing, a fair amount of padding, but in any case, the book is too long, and would have benefitted from some judicious cutting."
2,Be prepared to read slowly,"This is not a quick, easy read. This one takes a lot of concentration, yet it was very interesting. History buffs will love it."
4,4 stars,"I thought it was better as a whole than The Devil In The White City; easier to read, a little faster pace. But the arrest of Crippen was not only anti-climactic and rather matter of fact, Larson seemed in too big a hurry to wrap up his book and practically omitted the trial and aftermath of the arrest. He could have spent a few pages wrapping up the story in a more complete manner."
5,"Dual stories, one book","After reading Larson's ""Devil in the White City"", a new style and a new way to create an interesting and compelling plot becomes evident, and the writing was so good, so solid that one might wonder if the success could be duplicated, after all ""Devil in the White City"" won praise as well as a number of significant awards. Therefore I approached ""Thunderstuck"" with skepticism, but I was rewarded by an equally entertaining and well plotted novel.Melding two apparently unrelated story lines and characters into one cohesive read creates a new and very interesting genre as equally interesting as books like ""In Cold Blood"". Larson is a great storyteller and that is really all you need to know to read and begin appreciating all the hard work and research that went into its creation. It might even become a future classic, with a new genre for other adventurous writers to rise to the challenge of duplicating Larson's creations."
2,Misses the mark,"I tried very hard to like this book since I enjoyed Larson's other works. Like Devil in the White City, Larson ties true crime into real-life events of industrial triumph. Unfornately, in comparison to Devil in the White City, neither topic was nearly as interesting. The ""tie-in"" happens at the beginning of this story so there is little in the way of suspense or mystery. Unfortunately, as a murderer, Crippen is laughable and boring. The story of Marconi is interesting although details and repeated similar events keep the book moving at a slow pace. There is little in character development and although I finished the book out of curiosity for how everything would tie together, this was far from a page-turner. I would recommend Larson's other books and skip this one."
2,a long slog with little suspense until ?,"I have just listened to 6 hours of this audio book and in have had to give up on it. It drones on and on about Marconi and his battles with perfecting transatlantic radio communication while developing Dr Crippens story. Too much detail and not enough story for my taste. If you have a stomach for ad naseum detail this may interest you, but a fast paced story it is not."
2,Needs A Liitle More Spark!,"Larson is not the first author to combine the Crippen story with another piece of history in one book. David Zeni does this in FORGOTTEN EMPRESS where one chapter is SEPARATELY devoted to Crippen in his larger treatise about the ocean liner EMPRESS OF IRELAND. Larson at times weaves the wireless history well with Crippen but as the book lumbers forward, it devolves into what is really two separate treatments. A lot of Crippen detail mentioned in Zeni's single chapter credited to Kendall's autobiograpy never appears in THUNDERSTRUCK. For example, the titles from the ship's library that Crippen was reading on MONTROSE according to Kendall's 1939 autobiographical account don't match Larsson's. There is also an uncredited photo of Crippen and Le Neve on page 325...perhaps an oversight? On the other hand, Larson brought forward some Crippen research from Kew that I had not read before. The book is a great idea but falls somewhat flat. It could use a liitle more spark."
4,Not sure why the NY Times reviews were tepid,"I've read Eric Larson's first book: "" Devil in the White City"", and passesd it along to others with high recommendation. Why critics felt compelled to pan the second book, ""Thunderstruck"" as ""formulaic"" is beyond me. Much likes its predecessor, its 'formula' is the unfurling of historic events and the confluence of a macabre crime. This is a wonderful way to study time, events, and incredible people who shaped the world (for good or otherwise)in an entertaining and blazingly fast format which allows you to explore much of what put you to sleep in History 101 -So, Larsen's formulaic? So what? I think it's been said (Socrates?)that there are only six original ideas, and many ways to to express them. I look forward to Mr Larson's next 'formulaic' work."
2,Mildly interesting.,"I was looking forward to reading this, and had pretty high expectations after reading the AMAZINGThe Devil in the White City: Murder, Magic, and Madness at the Fair that Changed America. While it tried to tie together Marconi and this murder it never really happened. Just two fairly disjointed accounts of an interesting historical event (wireless) and a pretty standard murder. Not bad, not a page-turner either."
5,Thunderstruck,"I actually read this a few months ago, but I just happened to see it while searching for something else and thought I'd add my two cents. I enjoyed this book a lot more than I thought I would. The murder part sounded fascinating, but the wireless stuff sounded like something my Dad would enjoy. ;)(just kiddin dad) But I was surprised to find that the characters surrounding that amazing invention were just as fascinating as any murderer I've ever heard of. If you are a true crime fan, and you're on the fence about this one, give it a shot. You won't be sorry."
3,Generally a Good Read,"This is one of those good kind of books that goes great with a rainy day and a cup of tea as you sit in your very normal surroundings imagining a place that is unimaginable.Beware, though, of the large portions of uninteresting zoological mumbojumbo, and even worse, the offensive and continuous ranting of the Darwin-religion rhetoric.Dig past the rubbish, and you'll find something worthwhile."
3,A reasonable introduction,I am in no way an expert about this subject and I thought that this book did an okay job as an introduction. I did find it tricky but a lot of that is the nature of the subject and my own lack of prior knowledge.It was quite well judged in the way it built on concepts that were introduced at the start and for most of the book I did feel that I understood the subject. However once the basics were dealt with it did seem a bit rushed. It was just too short. I think that it is a subject that is just not suited that well to this format.There were some illustrations but they were completely pointless. The author would sometimes give his own political opinions and I found this increasingly irritating. Maybe in a lecture I would have found it witty but I felt that it just got in the way.The writing and layout was lucid and well thought out. Maybe it's just me but I thought that I still did not fully understand the subject after I had finished reading the book.
1,A Wrong Choice,"I'm inclined to say it's the worst VSI I've read. I had to make an earnest effort in the second half of the book to keep from skimming-browsing-leaping pages. And it wasn't worth the effort. The author presents a construct (rational choice), and then props it on a score of rules and conditions that must be met in order for choice to be rational. When reality diverges from the model, it's reality's fault, not the model's. This ultra-theoretical giddiness is applied to gambling, ordering food, and other examples that are not as interesting as the subject would've allowed. A comparison with truly interesting books on related subjects, such as Gladwell's Blink or Bennett's Randomness, leaves this VSI in a bad place.The illustrations are chosen haphazardly, often with nothing but a tangential connection to the text. This all adds up to something more along the lines of the author's extremely personal and debatable take on choice theory, rather than a very short introduction."
3,Old but good!,"This game really reminds me of the Micro Machine games. I bought this purely for nostalgia reasons, but came out enjoying it. Im a fan of the Waverace series and the extremely cheap cost didnt hurt to see where it all started out."
1,OK for very light use,"I bought this machine at a garage sale cheap. Needed a fax machine. It was okay for very light use. However, if I waited too long to use it, the ink dried up. Then I started to need it more. The ink cartriges ran out very quickly. Finally, it drove me crazy always having to replace the ink all the time. I replaced it with a brother 7820N that I really like."
1,Canon Multipass C530 inconvenient for use with a laptop,"I purchased a new Multipass C530 hoping to use it with my laptop computer, operating under Windows 2000. I quickly learned that using the C530 with my laptop was very inconvenient. The drivers for the fax/scanner interfere with the operating system start-up when disconnected from the C530. Canon tech support suggests that laptop users load the BJC-4000 drivers and set the C530 to DOS print mode. Evidently this works for some, but not for me. Best to use the C530 for desktop computers only."
4,Good approach to blues,This is a great instructional dvd on blues playing on the acoustic guitar. It takes a look at techniques and style points that will elevate your playing.
5,Overheating assistance,"My laptop (hp pavilion dm4) kept overheating when I was using it on the sofa/on my lap because I was blocking the airflow. This stand allows you to work with the computer on your lap, effectively, because you raise it up to keep the air flowing which allows the computer to stay cooler. A+++"
5,Very FAST Shipping,Ordered my item on Sunday and received it on Wednesday. Look forward to doing business w/ you again.
5,A Most Enjoyable CD,"Jantje Smit has a wonderful voice. Even though I don't speak German, with the words included I can still sing along. One song is in English, a beautiful version of Danny Boy. The melodies range from slow to toe-tapping fast. This is a most enjoyable collection of music."
4,useful book,"This book is quite useful for helping out with a sick child. Unfortunately there are a lot of products that aren't available to everyone. For example where I grew up there was not a naturopath for MILES. Therefore a good portion of the book would not apply to my circumstances. Still, I do what I can and appreciate the information it contains about basic immunity-building and natural remedies. It is very supportive and info-rich."
5,I lke this book,It really works. I use it almost every time when I 'm going to shop.I know what to avoid. I found it in library and now I'm going to buy it. Thank you Lucy.And my child doesn't sick in this winter.
1,Very boring and poorly written!,"I could barely finish this book,being a huge Bette Davis fan! I found it very boring! I kept turning the pages to try to get to an exciting part! the book was mostley based on documented material and not so much ""the woman"" than ""the performer"" I've started reading ""Fasten Your Seatbelts"" and it looks pretty good! try that instead don't waste your money on this! You'll be board to tears!!!"
1,This book is awful,This book is terrible. I'm doing a book report on this book and I cannot comprehend any of it for the life of me. He rambles on and on about stupid stuff. Christianity and Judaism are rarely mentioned the first half of the book and that is what the stupid book is supposed to be about. DO NOT READ if you do not have a vocab level of that of an Ivy League student. Every copy of this book needs to be burned and erased from existence and needs to be written better by someone else. If I could give this zero stars I would!
4,Good work.,"This is probably the best generalist study of the Middle Ages I have read. The author is clear, concise, and tends to get the broad outlines of history and its dynamics right. And the work is quite accessible.However, I did notice a number of errors in his text, or at least contrarian statements offered with no evidence etc. My suspicion is that these are just misunderstandings. For example, his appraisal of side-rudders on ships is quite different from what people have said who have actually tried such designs, and I am not at all sure what he means by the Norse practising polygamy. However, I wouldn't expect a generalist to get everything right all the time.All in all, though, I would recommend this work."
3,Haven't read it yet,"It looks like an interesting book and I will probably read it, but just from looking at the index, I see there is nothing in the book about Astrology, which was tremendously important during this time period. I am a student of Traditional Medieval Astrology and these types of books often neglect this subject, most likely as a form of academic prejudice."
5,Renthal C291 R3-2,The Renthal C292 R3-2 provides a smooth ride. In other words Renthal R3-2 is the Best Chain for the buck!
3,A great talent... and not her best work,"I've been a fan of Chaka's since the `70s - her vocal agility is intact on ""Funk This,"" but I find some of the songs to be weak. I'm not sure why she would re-cut ""You Got the Love""... her pipes sound a little shrill at times, too. Still, a few gems are on here, and - she IS Chaka."
5,Loving It,"I'm a long-time Chaka fan and as soon as I listened to the album, I bought an album for a friend. There are a lot of good songs, but ""Direspectful"" is a funky masterpiece."
4,She is still gettin it done!,"Chaka Khan is still fine, she is still sexy and can still sing,very well! If you're gonna do something,you might as well do it right and she has.(Funk This) is excellent,just put it in and enjoy."
3,A step in the right direction,"This is not a bad CD, I was expecting a much better CD considering the level of talent that appears. Chaka's voice is still the most amazing in the business, but these song truly demonstrate the lack or creativity That plagues the music industry."
5,Great music,Khan belts out the best funky music ever. Good background music and singers makes this a very enjoyable CD.
5,Excellent Album,I was very pleased after hearing the album. Chaka is truly an outstandingvocalist; and her voice and music are extraordinary. The arrangements are quite uplifting and move the spirit and the soul. Very enjoyable music and entertaining.
4,"Not as ""Funky"" as ""House"" was.........","I adore Chaka Khan. She is one independant woman with guts. Just look at her track record.She left Warner Bros and started her own record label in 1998, and recorded (with the help of Prince) ""Come to My House"", which was hailed by the critics and justly so. It was criminally buried because there was no promotional backing (being her own small record label).Forward 9 years or so, CK signs to Sony. Funk This is a brilliant CD don't get me wrong, but I'm strangely suspicious that it has won two grammy's when ""House"" was a far superior record.All hail Chaka anyway, because for me, she has finally gotten the grammy's she should've had 10 years ago........"
2,Not Her Best Effort,"I have been a Chaka Fan for as long as I can remember. She is one of my all-time favorite singers. However, I must admit that this CD is not that good. After listening to it twice, I wanted a refund. Also, how this CD won a Grammy is beyond me. As far as I'm concerned, a young, talented R&B artist was robbed out of a Grammy."
3,Classic Chaka,"Chaka is a dream come true. She is deep in my heart and deep in my soul. The fast songs on this CD left me wanting, but the slow ones Especially Angel brought me to tears.Next time I'd like to hear More ballads, because with the power of her voice and the precision of her range, she can do no wrong. It's close to Past time for the fast songs in my opinion, but I still love you."
3,Say what?,"I'm a HUGE Chaka fan. This lady doesn't get her proper respect. She's the queen of ""sexy soul funk."" On ""Funk This"" the music is definitely funky but I'm disappointed because I can barely understand the lyrics. No one can touch her style for brave inflections, she won't be denied!... she's Chaka. I know that's her signature singing style but the lyrical slurs really kill the CD. I feel cheated because when the music is ""blah"" some good lyrics would surely sweeten the deal. And vice versa, when the lyrics are clear, the melogy and singing are over the place! The first few times listening to this CD, I could only listen to the first 5 tracks before I was no longer really listening. The best songs are ""Angel"", ""Will You Love Me"", ""Foolish Fool"" and ""One for All Time. ""Sign O the Times"" and ""You Belong To Me"" are classics that are too ""80's"" for a comeback CD and seem to be thrown in as fillers. Still love ya Chaka!"
4,Great & A Classic,I'm glad Chaka released another album and this is a thumbs up. Nothing more to say.
3,Legend,"For the most part, this cd is most worthwhile, especially the song,""Angel"" and the fact that Chaka Kahn is singing, some of the other tracks are less than stellar due to excessive screeching that Ms. Kahn does not have to do in order to appeal to the masses."
3,Good album but not her best,"Chaka is powerful, there is no question! However, this album fails to connect the dots. The songs bounce all over the place and lack continuity. However, it is a must have for your Chaka collection."
3,Disappointing,"I am a huge Chaka fan and I must admit that I was disppointed by this one. With the exception of 1 or 2 songs, the album felt flat and uninspired. I think I'm going to stick with the vintage Chaka from now on."
2,very average,"Chaka Khan's influence on R&B Female artists is well known and her voice is her signature which often never gets the full goods on albums all the way to match her vast Influence and this album is added to the long pile of her albums that while has some decent moments, never reaches the zenith of her vocal powers fully. in all honesty this album is basically a cover album along the lines of what Rod Stewart and Barry Manilow are doing these days. I like the fact that Chaka does a Duet with Mary J. Bliege and I feel she needed to do more of a modern sounding record and up date her thing. this album is decent but nothing really stands out to me and this album feels alot like Babyface's most recent album. alot of Covers but not much on the original side."
5,Old School Returns with a Vengeance!,"WOW.....! This is so good it's hard to explain, but if Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis took a risk producing this CD, it should pay off ten-fold. The most unique and wonderful thing about Chaka's voice is that it can take on so many different qualities. She shows the world again, why she is so D#@* tough! Melodic is probably the best word to describe the entire CD. The musicians are really good, the arrangements are excellent, and Chaka sings with such ease it's remarkable. ""Angel"", ""Back in the Day"", and the Rufus remakes are all exceptionally done; the BEST jam is definitely ""One for all Time"" which has an incredible arrangement. This is the type of music most of the ""old schoolers"" really long for...this is REAL music and not one of these young artists will ever be able to create this type of music."
5,Excellent!,This is one of Chaka's best works to date! I would definitely recommend it to any lifelong Chaka fan. She even does a respectable cover of Jimmy Hendrix Castles Made of Sand and adds new versions of a couple songs from her Rufus days. Listened to it last night and again in my car on the way to work today! A Must!
5,Chaka is still the best,"I have loved Chaka Khan since her first album with Rufus. When I purchased this cd and listened to the songs, I was still amazed at the wonderful sound of her voice. She brought back fond memories of her older recordings but everything still sounded fresh."
2,Chaka Khan-Funk This,Not as good as GHAKA CD that I enjoyed the entire CD I just cant stop playing.This CD had only two sets that i liked.
1,Not What I Expected!,"After hearing the song ""Angel"" I figured at least 99% of the cd would be the bomb. I've always been a big Chaka fan but this cd did not do anything for me, except ""Angel""."
3,great price!!!!,I have a central vacuum system and purchased the bags at a vacuum store. When I found them at Amazon I bought them because of the great price.
2,Not Genuine Nutone Bags,"While the price is fair, these are generic brand bags, not genuine Nutone 391 bags. Having used the latter for many years, there is a difference. The picture is very misleading. Be warned."
1,NOT GENUINE NUTONE BAGS,Very disappointed that the photo shown is not what I received. The tiny label on the package says Nutone but they are clearly not genuine Nutone bags and certainly not Nutone quality. Shame on Amazon.
4,Looks good - not exactly what I expected.,"The vacuum cleaner bags were labeled and advertised using the words ""Nutone replacement bags... by Nutone."" After we received the bags it is obvious that they are not genuine Nutone bags. The price was good and the quality appears to be okay. We will see how they perform. I am just disappointed that I received a product I was not expecting."
2,Great Idea But Why Do They Dry Out?,Markers were mostly dry when I received them even though they came with a guarantee on the back of the packaging that they wouldn't be dry. Nice design though they just have to figure out how to keep them from drying out
2,Marks A Lot Markers,"Unfortunately, these retractable white board markers, that we were so happy to find, did not work very well. In fact, several were completely dried up. Others were faint, and almost dried up. Good product, but we got a bad lot."
5,Most potent book on Alchemy and Relationships,"I am not an analyst nor even a formal student of psychology. Even so I own 2 copies of this book and have read it 4 times now. I do read a fair amount about alchemy and about relationships and this book, by far, is the most potent and pragmatic text I have read on either subject. It is meant to be studied and its audience is those who wish to truly master the art of Alchemical Human Relationship."
1,"Misleading title, & definitely NOT for homework assignments","If you are looking for a book to explain the phenomenon of ""pink snow,"" this is not your book. Pink snow is explained on only one page, as falling snow formed around red soil. As a librarian who has faced homework assignments on the topic of ""pink snow,"" I have learned that it is actually found in mountain ranges, under certain conditions, and is caused by microscopic algae. This certainly could have been explained on the easy reader level but it was not. I would hesitate even recommending this for leisure reading, since it will end up causing students confusion in the long run."
2,Thin and mono,"The cover looks promising. The sound sample seems decent, but avoid this recording. I'm betting it was recorded an older video recorder. It's in mono, totally lacking middle and low frequency content. Buy one of the excellent Cape Cod soundscapes by Rykodisc -- the Atmospheres Collection. High-quality, professional recordings."
1,Choose Lisle 12550 not 12570,"Lisle 12550 is a set of 3 brake hex bits, and they are priced cheaper than the 12570. The picture shows 3 bits on the 12570, but the details are for only the size 3/8 bit. I was in a hurry and accidently ordered the 12570. When I received only the 1 bit, thats when I found out I should have ordered the set under the part number 12550."
3,Fair...,I bought these for my office b/c I took the $100 Altec's that I bought a few years ago home.They do not compare to the $100 set but neither does the price. A fair deal for the money.
4,WOW - do people really live like this????,"This book is fabulous! If you are hooked on home interiors, then this is the book for you. Enjoy it with a good cup of coffee, put your feet up, and you will be transported to a world that is filled with luxury,elegance,style,and color. I did not rate it a 5, though, because of the 15-20 apartments that are included in this book, only about 2-3 are decorated in a style that is not ""traditional."" Although I personally prefer the traditional style (chinoisserie, chintz, silk drapes, etc.) it certainly would have been a good idea to include a variety of decorating styles. And since these are all New York apartments, it is odd that the author couldn't either find or offer more diverse decorating styles in this cosmopolitan city. Even so, you will not be disappointed!"
5,Visually Stunning,"This is simply an haute couture guide for homes. Stunning photography showcase these magnificent homes and provide a peek into a world few of us will ever actually inhabit. More than just a glamorous photo book, this is a must have for anyone interested in traditional, luxury interior design or looking for elegant styles to emulate.The 25 apartments featured in the book are beautifully photographed and provide some basic information as to how the rooms were put together to get the over all ""feel"". This is not a ""how to"" book but rather a virtual portfolio of some of the best designers in the City.This is a wonderful coffee table book and would make a traffic gift to anyone interested in design, lifestyles or New York City."
2,Good Game!,"The game itself is absolutely fantastic! I am getting a lot of fun and enjoyment out of it! That was the reason I went out and searched for what is typically called an ""old school"" type of video game. However, the cartridge is a bit loose and I can hear an odd rattling sound out of the game case. I don't play it as much as I would like due to this rattling sound."
4,Only if you are a tetris enthusiast,"I love tetris so I like this game and play it often, but the game is not complex in any way and the graphics are very simple."
1,You people have no life,"This game is LAME with a topping of lame.I have to admit this game is kinda fun(my older sibling enjoy it) but that does not give it a 5-star also if you are reading this save your rating for the Xbox 360, Play Station 3 and the Nintendo Wii. I will say again go bury yourself because if you love this game you are dead inside"
5,love it,"tetris is my favorite and I'm so glad I was able to find it. I lost mine and was so happy to find this one. It's nice and works well. Still kicking my but at 120 lines, but ya' know how that is."
5,Tetris can't go wrong,I recieved it and it works just great. It provided me with memories from a lost childhood. A simple and fun game (that can also be stimulating for the mind). What more could one ask for? Innocense...purity...tetris
5,A curve ball straight to your pop heart!,"This CD just keeps growing on me and surprising me with its (read ""Ted's"") variety of sound, great musicianship, and sensitive and concise lyric talent. I can't get these wonderful songs outta my head (and I love it)! One or two cuts have overly-long 'sustained feedback outros' (sometimes producers wanna get cute with the 'love us cause we're casual about this recording thing' approach) but the big picture is that this album solidly delivers the goods! It rocks, it sings, it does everything."
5,Amazing,"This album is amazing. Anyone can really like this music. It's upbeat, powerful, and at times can rock out. There are songs like Biomusicology which just give you an upbeat awesome feeling or there are the awesome guitar riffs in Stove By a Whale. It's amazing from beginning to end. Let's just say ""had i never come across the vastness of pavement"", I would be less of a person!"
1,Anti-Mysticism,"The sole reason I gave only one star is because most of the writers of the articles in this book are against mysticism, that it is false, and an illusion. I thought I was getting a book that was pro-mysticism in various religious traditions. I did not know it would be a criticism of it as an illusion or fake construct. The 'experts' in this book are in favor of traditional religion and against mysticism. Take the article by Hans Penner titled The Mystical Illusion where he says 'mysticism is an illusion, unreal, a false category which has distored an important aspect of religion.' That theme against mysticism is common throughout this book. If you want a book putting down mysticism as fake then this book is for you. If you want a book that explains the mystical tendency in all religions as positive then this book is worth 1 star."
2,Problems Working,"When I put the game into the Game Boy it wouldn't work. I tried everything to get it to work, with no success. The game was given as a Christmas present, so I had to tell my daughter that I couldn't get the game to work and I would buy her another one. When I got home, she called me the next day to let me know that her and her friends had worked on the game and had finally got it to work by blowing into the game several times and then putting it into the Game Boy. I will not buy another game from the seller because I had so much trouble with the game."
4,"Good, but could've been way better.","This game wasn't all that bad. The Graphics were poor to the point that i couldn't see any secret areas. The controls were very good. The concept was great and the game (minus the graphics) itself was great, but the graphics messed it up. I hope Rare re-makes this game for the advance, for it could be a major hit."
2,DONKEY KONG ON GAMEBOY=======WASSA,"This game is ok. One thing I hate about this game is it only has about three colors, when games like Men In Black use all 56 colors th Gameboy Color has to offer."
2,a ok game,the game is pretty fun. but it has no bosses. its cool when you die you can change into donkey kong or diddy kong.
2,"Beautiful look, horrible quality.","I loved this ring when I received it. It was absolutely beautiful. It fit well and looked lovely.Then I put it on. The main gemstone (Garnet) was loose, so I was going to send it back to be replaced. I went to put it back in the box and one of the side-stones (Cubic Zirconia) fell out of its setting.I immediately went to send it back; I contacted customer service numerous times to get information, and they never once understood what I was asking.I would not recommend. The quality is poor, the service at this company is lacking, and though it is not an expensive item, it costs more than it is worth. It is a shame, too, as it was a beautiful ring."
3,ring,"so far,so good.its a beautiful ring.hope stones dont get loose or loses its shine as others said."
4,Nice,It's a very pretty ring. Good cut and color. Sparkly-- and who doesn't like things that sparkle?
1,Scared me to death!,"So my blood pressure was running high-normal, and my Doc recommended that I take steps to lower it and get a BP monitor to track my progress. When I began using this I became more and more concerned that my head might pop off!! Just got back from my 2 month follow up. The good news is that my blood pressure has actually dropped a little. The bad news is that I wasted my money on this inaccurate piece of junk."
1,Please don't buy it.It is waste of money.,"I bought it on May 19th 2002 and gave it as present to my father-in-law , who lives in foreign country.Unfortunately I never tested it before giving him this product.He opened the gift pack after 1 year , the first time and is not working at all.I don't suggest anybody to buy this product.If at all you want to present anyone anything just test it before you give them to avoid humiliation.I bought it for $64.I would have used this money for other purpose."
5,Military Jacket,"Product arrived in a timely manner, and even though no size was requested when I ordered it - it (thank heavens) was the correct size. Perfect condition, my husband was very pleased."
1,Terrible,How can I rate a product I never received? I will be doing less business with Amazon in the future. Fortunately there are many sites to do business with. It's deserving of zero stars.
3,mediocre,"Not an extensive dictionary but considering the low price, the dictionary is mediocre. The vocabulary is very limited with no sentence examples but I personally found it extremely handy for verifying the pronunciation of most every day words. Cantonese is a fading language, its materials are limited and for most people, not worth spending much money or effort on."
2,Disappointed,"The first day they bruised my left toe due to friction with pieces of leather sticking out of the stiches inside the shoe. I have owned 5 pairs of outdoor kings and loved them. They did fit perfectly from the first day and although they did not last long, they performed flawlessly. I can't say the same about the indoor version. I'll try to do some modifications and if it helps me to get more use out of these I'll add to the comments."

3,Tastes Great,"I really like the taste but this pre-workout drink doesn't seem to provide as much energy as my other pre-workout supplement (Orange Rush). I bought both around the same time and one day decided to mix a half scoop of each together to get the best of both worlds. Now, this has become my regular pre/intra-workout drink of choice."
3,Failed after maybe 2 months,"Worked well at first, then fell off after maybe 2 or 3 months, plunging my wires back into a mess. Not even sticky anymore. Does anything really exist which sticks well, stays there, and doesn't damage the wall?"
2,not sticky enough for outdoor applications,"I have used these before indoors and hoped they would work with some lightwieght decorations outside. Unfortunately they do not. Whether it was the cold or the dew, they just couldn't hold on."
5,Great for lights,"We used these for hanging Christmas lights and they worked great on our patio! Held the whole Christmas season, even with the weather!"
4,Another great 3M product!,"I can not believe that this 3M product couldn't be found in stores (eg. Walmart, Walgreens,) when this could be a great organization tool! Anyway, I bought this item to hang christmas lights outside. I was thinking of purchasing the small one or the medium one and I decided to purchase the small one but more on quantity. It holds the wires properly however few hours later some of the cord clips started to fall down. I should have bought the medium ones since there's more space for the tape to attach plus more area for the cord clips to attach to the wall. However, I still love the product that I gave it a 4 star rating."
1,"Poor function, Poor Adhesive, Doesn't Hold cord very well.","I used these cord guides to run a Ethernet cable out to my router. If you're guiding the cord along the floor, then the cord-guides should do their job, but, if you try to use them to run a cord up a wall, or over a door-way, then you'll be out of luck. The guides will hold at first, and then fall off--(and I applied the adhesive according to the instructions on the box). The cord also tends to just fall out of the guide--its not held very securely.Just use some clear tape, or duct-tape, if the cord will be out of sight. You'll get better results for much cheaper. Remember that no adhesive will work on a dirty surface, so clean the wall before you stick stuff to it, and be aware of the type of paint on your wall, so that you don't tear off huge pieces of paint and lose a security deposit on your place."
3,Does not work on concrete,"I bought these for a project tho hang lights on a screen porch with concrete walls. It did not work. It does work on regular smooth walls, but definitely not concrete."
1,"Terrible for thicker, heavier gauge cables",Purchased 3 sets of these cable clips in order to avoid hammering holes into my apartment as I wired my home theatre. A heavier gauge (12 AWG) cable was used as there was quite a bit of distance to cover. These clips are suited best for one cable of a thinner gauge as 1) the glue cannot handle the weight of the wires and 2) the clips simply don't have enough room for more than 1 cable.I don't know what else I can use these for... nor do I know where I can locate any replacement command strips.
1,Does NOT come off cleanly!,"These work well, they hold the cables up and stick to the wall. But maybe they still TOO well. Even though 3M claims that they come off the wall cleanly, that is NOT true. I took mine down today because I'm moving and they took a chunk of the paint off (see customer images for a picture). So aggravating because now I have to patch up that spot before I move."
1,The glue part does not hold for more than 1/2hr,"I've bought several of this kind of Command Damage-Free Hanging hooks. The latest one claims to hold up to 3 lb. I tried twice, followed the instructions carefully plus pressed for twice as long and waited for twice as long as well. Still the hook fell off by itself after half an hour, from an 4-oz piece of cloth.I'm through with this line of products and I think they should recall all their products if they run an ethical business."
1,Non-functional product idea,"These clips seem like a great idea, but unless you're working with a relatively thick wire they really don't help much. I used these for speaker wire & had horrible results...still tripping over wires."
4,A Transplants Debut...,"Drexel D. Baker quit an established rock band , moved to New York City, and recorded this brilliant solo album all in the same 12-month period. A borrowed 4-track and a few favors from friends made it possible to do each of these things. Those favors are returned here on BloodyTransylvaniaStreetMachine.With off-kilter introspection and a tension that keeps you listening, Drexel's take on acoustic/electric cityscapes is worth your time and cash."
1,Wingfoot got me lost!,"After ten years of section hiking the AT, I have completely given up on Wingfoot's (so called) Trail Guide. In a word, it is hopelessly out of date and not worth the investment. I hiked several miles in the wrong direction on my last hike in Vermont because Wingfoot mis-directed hikers to a shelter that had been moved three years prior. Wingfoot is resistant to change and needs to thru-hike the AT again to bring his guide up to date.I highly recommend the ""Appalachian Trail Thru-Hiker's Companion.""Big E"
3,Focus: Writing Paragraph and Essay (2nd Edition),It was the the wrong book.I had to reorder.All in all the order came on time and in order the book was in order and I answered this review so why are you asking me again.
3,It does the job,"The 2100 does not have the best print quality nor speed but it is very compact and portable. This is important for a college student or apartment dweller who needs the space. Black and white pages come out fine at a decent speed. Simple color photos come out well also but it will take a while. One big problem is the the tiny ink cartidges which runs out very easily. But if you're looking for a space saving basic printer, this is worth considering."
4,Excellent party game for adults.,"I've had this game for several years. It's one of the few games I can convince my wife to play. Although some of the rules can get confusing, overall it's a great game that's easy to learn and play. I definitely recommend group play at your next party."
5,Fun...but not for the faint hearted,"I ended up playing this in a game club a few times and it was fun. Heck, out of a team around ten, I was able to get to 4th place so it's not that difficult to learn. This type is a must for role players since it's recommended to act out the attack but this is definitely a dark game. You and your friends are playing as lost Catholic School Girls who end up fighting each other. (Think of Battle Royal with only 10 years old school girls.) There are creepy photographs covering all the cards and it can get brutal (a mix of the attacks and actually forcing yourself to be mean) but if you're fine with this, go right ahead.."
4,May be alittle too much,"On the positive side, these are definitely the real deal and works. I did experience an over all resurgence of energy and just felt stronger.On the neg. side, it can restore/restart some things you may not want restored if you've already gone through menopause. This is a fat soluble substance, therefore it can build up in fat store and you can end up with much too high levels. This is not a substance you want to take unless you are deficient.I would recommend a lower dosage to begin and ask your Dr. if it is recommended for you."
3,Hard to say the actual results,"I can't say I noticed any big difference in energy with this product. I started taking another medication prescribed by my Doctor at the same time I got the DHEA. Overall, my energy is up a little bit. I still take this product because it might be part of what's helping me."
5,sad to glad with my light therapy,"A great aid for those of us afflicted with SAD. Light, portable, easy to use. There is a timer on it, as well. It's affordable, and does the trick!"
4,Great light!,"This is a great light. It is small and lightweight, so I pick it up off the floor and put it on breakfast table mornings (it has a nice concave opening in back which acts as handle.) I basically set it next to the morning paper and eat breakfast next to it, its compact enough to sit on our smallish table, and let the others eat too.It had surprising heft to it, not heavy, just seems to be well built, not flimsy.I would have given it five stars, but I do not need/use the ionizer feature, the timer is audible (tick tick tick...) though not really loud. I'll probably open it up and connect the light to the ion switch, so I can turn it on/off without having the timer involved (and thus disconnect the ionizer completely.)Added Note:I did open it up, and swapping the wiring around to use the ion on/off switch to control the light and bypass the tick-tick timer switch is not possible. Not sure the ion switch is rated for the amps/wattage of the lights either..."
1,WARNING: ONLY EUROPE 220V AVAILABLE ON THIS UNIT,"I should have read the other one star review before buying. Received this with a bulky, heavy transformer included. Wondered what the heck? Opened unit it is designed for Europe with 220V access only, hence the bulky transformer. Unacceptable! No where on the product listing does it state this. Would have given zero stars if I could have. To Amazon's credit, it is immediately accepted for return."
4,It just work,"I bought this light to see if it will help me with my sleep. I used to getaround 4 hours of sleep and now after 2 weeks I am getting around 6 to 7.If you are having sleeping issue I advice to use the light, start mantra meditation, and yoga exercise.Also, no coffee after 2PM."
3,For Better and for worse,"The second book of Robert Charrette's 'Secrets of Power' series is better than the first novel. He weaves several sub-plots into an at least semi-coherent whole, but many of the flaws present in his first book are present in this as well.There are few characters for the reader to really identify with. His 'hero' Sam Verner is a whiney, pedantic, and obtuse. He possesses few character traits that lead you to care about him, but we are forced to follow him nevertheless.If you enjoyed the first book, or are a fan of shadowrun then you will love this. The concept is interesting, and the writing style is adequate, if not particularly memorable. The reading level for this book (as with his other two) seems to be about seventh grade level. If you are seeking a deep, meaninful novel that makes you think, then I suggest that you pass this one by. Otherwise dig in. It is a nice 'mindless' read that I pull out from time to time when I don't want to tackle anything more compelling."
2,Badly done novel of betrayal and magic.,"I am going to start by saying that I like Charrette's books, but not on account of this one. Almost no convincing attempt is made to explain why the characters act and feel the way they do. Sam's reaction to Dodger's ""betrayal"" makes no sense, he was acting in Sam's best interests. Coincidentally, the lies he betrayed Sam with turn out to have the same effect in the end as if they were truth. Hart, the exotic elf and top knotch shadowrunner, who betrayed and tried to kill Sam, for some reason falls in love with him. Sam is constantly labeled to be average looking, but he becomes the lover of two beautiful women in this trilogy. I found the magical scenes boring, the best parts of this book were the Matrix runs, which Charrette does well in all of his books that I have read. This book has rushed feel to it, as middle books of trilogies sometimes do."
2,"Squishy, failed easily","I had this fork stock on a 2006 Specialized Hardrock Sport. This was my first 'real' MTN bike, and though I didn't notice it at first, this fork has a lot of flex, and unwanted travel. After replacing it with a nicer fork, the ride was much smoother..."
4,Great without the raisins,"I, too, am a fan of Mona's granola, so much so that I go to the trouble of picking out all the rock-hard raisins before I eat it. Those raisins will pull your fillings and crowns out! If they would just leave out the raisins they would have a superior product. (I add fresh blueberries instead - yum!)"
2,Awkward Fitting,"This dress is hanging in my closet unused. I was VERY disappointed. The sizing/measurements for the dress are very awkward. I have a larger than average bust size and I still found the top of the dress to be way too big. And the bottom of the dress doesn't have enough give. Since most women who would purchase this dress are post-partum and their tummies aren't down yet, you'd think designers would take this into consideration. Unless you are very tall, have a huge back and/or bust and extremely narrow hips and small bum, you aren't going to like this dress. Wasn't really impressed with the fabric either. Even if the dress didn't fit so awkard, I still think $60 is way too much. Don't waste your money like I did."
3,"Good interface, OK scans","I have had this scanner for about 2 years and have never had a problem with it. The drivers are a little hard to find on cannons web site if you are running xp. it has a one button interface that you press when you want to scan something and it will ask you what program you use for the picture. that is a nice feature. The ""scangear"" drivers and software are pretty good and let you do some simple things when you preview the scan like brightness, contrast, cropping, before you do a final scan.If you want to print your pictures at high quality than i would resommend getting a higher quality scanner, but this is a great deal and qorks great for small images and posting your photos up on the web!"
2,Take me back to the old days (cuz the game sure does not!),"I thought this would be like the arcade version of Space Invaders Deluxe but I was disappointed. I could sit there all day and keep clearing the most ""advanced"" level. What happened to the challenge of the old game? As an ""old timer"" I enjoy the old arcade games that I grew up with...it would not have been too difficult to duplicate the arcade game or at least make it a challenge (as in Pac Man and Missle Command versions for Game Boy). By the way...where are Galaga and Gorf? At least 1942 is on the way."
3,Well....,"This game was very strange. It's pretty much like the old version yet too easy. If you want a great Space Invaders game, get it for PC. It's fun and if you beat the game(it's really easy), you unlock the old version. This game isn't too good. Just skip it."
1,I returned this camera for many reasons,"I returned this camera after 1 week for several reasons:1) It takes blurry pictures. About 85 percent of the pictures I took were blurry. I have a steady hand. I took pictures in a variety of lighting conditions, both inside and outside.2) The Kodak software is so buggy! Argh. It makes me angry. I had to uninstall it.3) No view finder. I knew this going in, but still found it annoying.4) I also got the digital frame in a package deal. It sucks too! There is no random feature so when you turn it on you have to see the same pictures, in exactly the same order over and over again.Plus, Best Buy charged me 33.00 as an open box fee just to return this junk. Sigh."
3,I expected more...,"Honestly I tough this would be a better camera, Kodak is one of the most famous manufactures in this industry, but definitely this small digital cameras are not their best. Nice shape product, nice LCD size to preview pictures in the camera, but to slow from one picture to the other, once you take a picture, you have to wait more than in other similar cameras to take the next one. I have try several other brands in similar price and type of cameras and the best one so far is Sony. Delivery on time, product packing not as expected."
4,Great camera for the pricw,"I got one of these in Nov 2007 on sale. I have to admit I have been impressed with it. I know that there is a lot of anti-Kodak bias out there. I have several digital camera (Nikon D50, Nikon D40, Sony W7, Sony W80, Panasonic DMC-FZ50, Nikon S200 and a few more) and this one holds it own. Don't get me wrong, it won't match the speed of the DSLR but if you want a simple camera or a basic second camera when you don't want to take your more expensive one, consider this or the similar Kodak M753."
2,Very Disaponnited With This Camera!,"I have the kodak easyshare c763. It takes ok pictures in the day time with proper lighting. Night shots are horrible. This camera has no optical view finder so it is very hard to see your subjects when there is low light. The differnt shooting features like, party, beach, etc are completely useless. There is no red-eye reduction. I owned this camera for only a year and the external zoom lens gets stuck all the time and won't retract back! This is the second kodak digital camera I have owned withthin the last 3 yrs. I will pay a higher price to get better quality and a better brand next time."
2,KODAK CAMERA,"WHILE THIS LOOKS LIKE A NICE CAMERA AND IT DOES WORK. i AM ASSUMING IT IS WORKING AS WELL AS IT IS SUPPOSED TO. IT TAKES PICTURES TOO SLOWLY FOR ME. I HAVE A NEW BABY AND BY THE TIME CAMERA HAS ACTUALLY CAPTURED THE EVENT, THE BABY HAS MOVED OR CHANGED FACIAL EXPRESSION OR CHANGED WHATEVER HE WAS DOING. FOR ME, IT WAS A WASTE OF MY MONEY AND I AM GIVING IT AWAY ALONG WITH ITS PRINTING DOCK THAT BOUGHT. AT LEAST IT DID NOT COST ME THAT MUCH, THEN I WOULD HAVE BEEN PIST"
4,Decent,"So, this camera survived travels, bar trips, being a college student, beaches, and beyond. Its durability is amazing and I could go an entire weekend without charging it once and taking hundreds of pictures.After 2.5 years of owning it, it has started freezing up and become blurry.The low-light/night pictures are useless. It doesn't capture things in motion very well. It has some other quirks that bugged me. I likely wouldn't buy a Kodak again. No zoom on the movie feature but the sound quality on the movies was great (I recorded a song at a concert on it).Flash works great though, and a 2GB memory card would hold 45 minutes of movie or 2000 pictures on it.It's a quality camera for simple use."
5,Two Steps in One Polish,"The Essie Protein Base Coat is two steps in one and while you are giving yourself a manicure or pedicure (or taking these along to the salon - a good idea because they are better than the other polishes and dry faster!), you will notice how this smoothes out your nails and prepares them for a perfect nail polish finish. This formula contains camphor, silica and collagen for healthy, strong and flexible nails. The nail polishes also go on perfectly and there are so many colors to choose from!~The Rebecca Review"
5,Only complaint is that they didn't offer it two years ago...,"Perfect, simple product for the nagging problem of getting line voltage near your electronics. Other versions have been available from other sources for a while now, and you could always roll your own, but this is a nice, elegant, reasonably priced package that does precisely what it should do.By the way, the other reviewer's comments about mixing 5 volt and 12 volt components is incorrect. You should NOT use a 5 volt power source with a 12 volt device. Granted you *probably* won't damage it, but IF it works - which is unlikely - it will probably be unreliable. I'm an Electronics Engineer with over 25 years of career experience; it's up to you whom you should trust!"
5,Easy to use,"The hardest part I had in setting up the product was identifying the ethernet cable that went to the remote location. After that was taken care of, I plugged everything in and it worked. (Yes, I'm working on labeling my cables.)"
2,"great idea, poor POE standard support","says it will work with standard POE on Linksys WAP200 without the endpoint adapter, but it made the ethernet flaky. to get it to be reliable I had to use both ends."
4,Also useful for 48V DC POE devices,"Appears to implement 802.3af Power Over Ethernet (POE) standard in full. Marked down because the documentation supplied and available on Linksys web site is so dismal.I'm using it with a Cisco 7960 phone, though that requires a custom cable with pins 4&5 swapped with 7&8, since the phone uses Cisco's pre-standard POE pin-out."
2,Better Luck Next Time,"This book has a few really great things going for it. The author obviously knows what he's talking about when he writes his DC street scenes. I grew up in DC and he has the accent (yes, there is a DC accent) and the slang down pat. He has a great heroine but he loads her down with so many woes that she has to be a Cleopatra Jones style superwoman. Some of her decisions and feats strain credulity. The plot was way too predictable. I knew immediately what the ending was going to be by the middle of the book.The author is obviously a very talented writer. The things that are wrong with the book are mainly typical first book flaws. Better luck with the second one."
2,Angela Bivens Mystery,"Way too much vulgarity for my taste. This book was written to appeal to the gritty, but the gritty don't do much reading. I would suggest the next Angela Bivens story clean up a bit. There are way too many stereo typical manerisms for black people in this story. Cursing and slang are just to name a few. Now for the actual story. Predictable. Absolutely predictable. Yes, the brother did it. Who would have guessed? ME> The style of writing was fast and I didn't mind the skipping to one scene to the next. Most writers do that when they think it will be a better movie than a book. But it's not a movie. It's a book. An will probably remain that way."
4,This was my first mystery novel in years...,"...and I found it to be well worth the read. The story is well constructed, the characters are quite interesting and the action called for head-and-page turning. The depictions of Black professional and social life in D.C. had me feeling like I had to know these people. I got a little lost in some of the departmental acronyms (I would advise readers to make a note or two) and the mythical references, but overall, the book was a simple pleasure to read.I hope that Brother Chambers can finagle a movie deal out of this one. If the casting and production quality match the level of the original work, he just might have a major hit on his hands.I recommend this book for all fiction and non-fiction readers, and I look forward to the next Angela Bivens work. I truly hope that I can soon look back on my first book and feel that it was as well written."
1,Don't Buy!,"I have been a fan of orginizing my media with discgear in the past, but this was the worst, and unfortunatly, they've lost a valuable customer because they were unwilling to resolve the issue. I made the unfortunate mistake of purchasing 4 of these storage units. Turns out the slots that hold the discs are cheapely made and tear apart with normal use. I had more than one sleeve rip at the seam. I contacted discgear about it, but they won't do anything about it. Beware."
5,Quantitative Finance for Everyone,"This is a breakthrough book in quantitative finance: comprehensive, up-to-date, mathematically rigorous, fun and easy to read and eminently practical. It covers all aspects of quantitative finance, each area progresses from abstract mathematical theory to real application. The author has used sidebars, graphics and cartoons to ease the reader along. This is essential because most readers will be interested in only certain aspects: some will just want a formula, others want to understand the intuition behind a concept, still others will want to see a practical example. The arrangement makes it easy to locate what you need. It could be read from cover-to-cover by someone who wanted to teach themselves to be a quantitative finance expert, or as a reference book, or anything in between. It replaces a bookshelf full of quantitative finance books."
5,Keep up the good work!,"I loved this book. It goes way beyond his other books such as Derivatives, to places not even conceived of by other authors. The first part of the book is pretty basic, but very well written. But by the end your mind will be totally blown.I've read lots of reviews comparing and contrasting Wilmott to Feynman, Sagan, and god knows who else. One thing is for certain Feynman and Sagan aren't writing much these days so it's good to have Wilmott! Long live Wilmott!"
1,Superficial coverage...,"Wilmotts book is an incomplete treatment of a wide variety of financial problems.And most of problems are based on the PDE approach,instead of the more powerful risk-neutral/martingale approach."

3,Very 70's feeling to it,"Okay kids bible, I guess, but the art is so boring that we out it away and haven't looked at it again. The art is heavy, uninteresting, very 1970's and outdated."
3,Great magnet but case is flimsy,"So I searched long and hard before buying this because the wall knife magnet in my old house was weak and the knives would fall easily which is dangerous. The reviews on this was that the magnet was very powerful. I agree it is. The knives stay put which is great. But and there is a but here. The case that goes around the magnet which is what holds it in place is very flimsy. You see you end up putting a screw in each end and then sliding the caps through the plastic base in order to hold it in place. Then you let the magnet do the rest. But when you go to remove a knive, the magnet is so strong that you end up pulling the knive and the entire manget base bends up or down depending on the direction. I don't like this because it give a false sense that something bad is about to happen. They should have spent more time producing a rigid strong base like my old set. I wish I could have the base from my old unit and the magnet from my new one. Then I would be set."
2,"Hard to Install, Flimsy Material","It holds our Global knifes to the wall, but we had a hell of a time trying to install this thing. Also, during installation, the ends cracked very easily under slight pressure. The magnet is strong, but the plastic is very low quality, soft and flimsy."
3,so so,"this is an ok product, I was expecting more from Henckels. The strip is not robust and the magnets not so strong - for some that may be an advantage. I think this product should have been priced lower."
5,Knive holder,"If you buy one, you need to buy two if you have long, heavy knives, two just works so much better than one for big knives. If your knives are under 10 inches, one works relly well."
1,No Latin Flavor,I was hoping this album would have songs in Spanish. Nope.I was hoping it would have great dance tracks like previous Verano compilations- like Suavamente by Elvis Crespo. This Album is completely monotonous house/ techno music that is mind numbing!Very disappointing.
3,Waste of money,"I bought this item thinking it would suck up the debris from the bottom of my pool, but the suction was very low and the second time I used it, a part broke and I couldn't use it any longer. It was a waste of my money. Luckily I sent it back and was able to get my money back."
1,Pool Vac Ineffective,"I used this afew times and realized that the construction is not adequate for producing enough suction. After multiple uses - and carefully following instructions, my initial impression was supported as there was almost no debris collected in the units screen."
1,SPA AND POOL VAC NOT A TOY,"I purchased this product for an 8 ft round, 22 inch deep inflatable pool. It made sense because it did not need a filter or batteries. It works by pumping the handle to create suction to vacuum the pool. As long as it stayed together, it worked wonderfully. The removable filter held everything and the concept was great! HOWEVER, the glue that the manufacturer used to hold the plastic together did not last! I went through 3 of them in 3 months and the first 2 broke on the second use. I attempted to epoxy the pieces together with no or limited success. The manufacture's glue let loose in 2 different places. Amazon was great about replacing the product but after the 3rd time, I have requested a refund! Great concept but extemely poor durability! Buyer beware!"
5,Great for quick clean up!,"This is not a toy! It is a nifty little water-suction-pump pool vac that we use regularly between our weekly pool services.It easily picks up leaves, silt, bugs and so on so that the pool always looks clean. We love it.It is manual, but not at all hard to use. You just submerge it until it fills with water, then point at the debris and start pulling the pump handle. It only cleans small areas at a time, so doing a whole pool can take some time if there is a lot of debris, but we use it almost daily so it takes very little time.It is a little tricky to get the filter out unless you dry your hands, but once you get the knack of it - it is pretty routine.For the price, it sure beats that big, ugly barracuda thing we used to have traveling around the pool all the time.If you are short and have deep water, it might not work so well; but our 32 ft. pool maxes at about 5'8"", so we can manage it."
1,Poor quality and breaks easily,This vacuum works for the first 10 minutes of use before it starts falling apart leading to breaking completely. Regret!
4,"Works great, but just OK quality","Works great for cleaning debris (including sand) from my hot tub. I have two of these units. Both do the job, but both are less than heavy duty in terms of construction. I've had to apply a little glue here and there on both units despite ""light"" usage. But for the price, they're really quite useful. Just recognize they're not ""industrial strength."""
1,Junk. Broke when assembling,"We purchased this because it was cheap, but it was not cheap enough. The best part about it was the box. It comes in multiple pieces that you have to assemble (""Screw Part 1 into Part 2...""). The only problem is that when you do this Part 1 falls off with its screw-part attached to Part2-never to connect again. This is basically a Super-Soaker that you put in the bottom of the spa, suck up the debris and then shoot it elsewhere in the garden-no filter or debris catcher I could find. Even though it could not go together I put the nozzle on the end to see how it would fit. When I took it off, the whole end came off it my hand!.Skip it. I'm going to try a more expensive battery-operated pump instead:Water Tech Pool Blaster Max"
2,I Do NOT Recommend This Product,"Yes it sucks up debris, but the suction is very poor, it taks quite a bit of effort to get the max suction, the amount of debris it captures is very small, and if your spa is of decent size (6-8 people), it takes forever to pick up a considerable amount of debris."
1,Not Good for a Spa,Bought this to use in my spa. So far its been difficult to use on the contoured surfaces. It does not pick up the grit but just moves it around accomplishing nothing. Waste of time and money.
3,Spa vac,"This vacuum works okay...I'm just having a problem with the bottom part staying attached. It feels like it's screwed on tight, but after about 5 seconds in the water, it falls off. I need to really see what's going on and haven't had the time. This is the second time I've owned one. My last one lasted a few years and after a couple of years, I wasn't able to unscrew the botom to clean the filter. Go figure! I hesitated to buy one with batteries. Just couldn't imagine it lasting very long mixing batteries with water?"
3,Came damaged,"I wasn't expecting much for $1.79, but I was disappointed to open the package only to see that a couple of the beads had broken off. The color is also duller. Otherwise though this isn't a bad product for the price. It looks more expensive than it is. Still, beware of shipping damages."
5,Top reference manual for alignment in Iyengar Yoga,Excellent reference manual for body alignment and breathing techniques. Great photos accompany step-by-step descriptions for building the foundation of each pose.
5,Comprehensive Yoga Book,"This book has everything a yoga book should have, plus so much more. The thing that really sets it apart is the way they show so many modifications and use of props in the poses. The other unique thing about this book is that it has recommended practices, complete with pictures for each pose, for a huge list of issues. Including; obesity, diabetes, PMS, acne, infertility, stress, arthritis, back pain... the list goes on and on. A great reference tool for yoga instructors.P.S. If you're not into using props such as a bolster, blocks, or straps, this book isn't for you."
3,comprehensive but user unfriendly,"I am a total beginner and after examining all yoga books at Amazon, I decided to get this one after reading all the reviews. Yet it was impossible for me to work with this book because when you choose a program, you find out that you have to look for a different page for every single position. This is only good for those who want to know if they are doing a position correctly but you'll have to get another book for a yoga routine."
3,Very good but flawed,"Like all Dorling Kinderley books this is beautifully presented. The poses are clearly shown and explained along with variations, including the use of props (chairs, bolsters, blankets, bricks, straps, etc.). The drawback is that this book leaves out quite a few poses that many might consider essential or at least important. Light on Yoga, for example, includes virtually every pose one could ever expect to do, as well as the mudras, bandhas, etc. This volume sacrificed the number of poses shown to show more variations. It's a good addition, and it's enjoyable and informative. But if you want the most bang for your buck, and you're interested in Iyengar, stick with Light on Yoga."
5,Excellent,This book is amazing. I borrowed the older version from a friend and was excited to see the newer version. It is just as great as the old but with a nice added section about Iyengar himself. This is a great book. I especially love the section for yoga for ailments. I use it often.
4,One of my favs,"I've got 20+ yoga books on my shelves, and this is one of the ones I come back to again and again. I'm not strictly an Iyengar student but I still find a lot of his teachings relevent, and this (and Light on Yoga) are great references."
3,Good for Beginning Students,"I like this as a reference for my students. It gives them sequences to practice and to compare, with lots of pictures. Using it, they come up with very intelligent questions, which we then answer in class. I'm not crazy about some of the pictures, though, some of the modeling...I would have prefered pictures with more grace (more experience) - that's why only 3 stars, not 4. :)Joni Wellness"
1,Diesel Power,We've written the publisher a few times and we still haven't received thismagazine even though they respond that its on the way!!
3,A Primer for Neophyte Freelance Writers,"The problem I have always had with freelancing was placing a fair value on my work. In the more than 12 years I have been doing this I have found the organizations that employ freelance writers are diverse and the work they contract varies.It seems impossible to develop standards for the broad range of opportunities, that I as freelance writer find myself confronting.This volume attempts to fill that void. It attempts to give the creator benchmarks by which to judge the market marketplace. It discusses working conditions and general pay rates. Everything is done in broad ranges andIt has great section on copyright protections, contracts, negotiation techniques, business organization and financial management.The book is a broadbased primer; I was looking for specific answers to specific problems."
3,Probably not the first freelancing book you should read...,"I finally finished up the last freelance writing book I had checked out from the library. This one is the Freelance Writers' Guide put out by the National Writers Union. And all I can really say is ""eh""...It's a series of chapters written by different authors on various issues related to the publishing industry. Because the NWU is a group advocating the rights of writers, the tone and direction is more militant and confrontational than most of the other books I've read. There is plenty of ""we believe this is grossly unfair to..."" type statements scattered throughout, and it seemed to get a bit old after awhile. But conversely, if you are a freelancer trying to make a living at this, I suppose you have far more at stake here than I do.Information you should know, but probably not the first book on how do do freelance writing that you want to read. Little instruction on how, and more emphasis on running your business."
4,Great Book!,"I have been teaching Spanish to preschoolers for the last year. When I read this book, not only did I enjoy the story, I loved the way it was written. Ms. Ciavonne uses Spanish terms throughout the book. She allows the children to figure out what they mean from the context of the story. It also teaches about a tradition from a culture my students were not familiar with. Education through story is great for children. It is a creative, educational, enjoyable book. I would highly recommend it for older preschool children and elementary school children (and ADULTS :-)."
4,Perfect,The game works great. Nostalgia at its best. I couldn't ask for a better product at the price I paid.
2,My least favorite of the Metroid games.,"This is my least favorite game in the franchise. (Pinball does not count.) The lack of a map and annoying Chozo Ruins music severely limit the enjoyment. HOWEVER, I do reccommend playing the 1st area of this game and then playing the AM2R demo. You will not believe the difference. I can't wait for AM2R. GOD BLESS MILTON GUASTI!!!!!!!!!!"
3,"GREAT game,ok condition........","while i love sidescroller shooters this is GREAT and i would highly reccomend to a fan of the classic metroid games but the condition is a little bad the labels a bit torn and you might have to rock it around in your super gameboy,gameboy,or gameboy player but its a small price to pay for such an awesome game."
2,Terry Velour Bathrobe,I bought this for my husband who usually wears a size large and it fit but wasn't as comfortable or roomy as his old robe. If you are looking for a roomy bathrobe don't buy it if you wear a size large.
1,Not happy,"Although the robe looked great when it arrived, it has been less than a month and it is already falling apart. I've had to sew up two different places in the side seams. I'm very disappointed in the quality of this product."
2,Not So Great,"I kept this about a year and trashed it. Color fades after first wash, material became course and uncomfortable, and the stitching all came out of the belt (even prior to washing). Looks good when you get it though."
1,coffee pot,"cooffee pot is not a good one drips everywgereDeLonghi DC50W Twenty Four Seven Drip Coffee Maker, White"
2,not good,let me say that this is my third black and decker coffee maker i have had.there is no way possible to pour a cup of coffee without pouring it all over the place.i have never seen this much leakage.very unsatisfactory.thank you. PS otherwise coffee maker is ok.
1,The Worst Coffee Maker Ever -so far,"I needed a quick coffee maker and picked up this model at local hardware store and paid a premium..little did I know.. The pot drips, no matter how we angle the pot while pouring, a mess occurs....We cannot make the right amount of coffee..if we pour 5 cups of water in tank and fill up to line, we get about 3 cups of coffee, what's up with that, so we never know how much coffee to use..what a mess....never again!!!!!"
1,Black & Decker 5-cup brew,"This is one of the worst products, that I have ever purchased. The pot leaks, whenever you pour. If it were not for the fact that I have thrown away the box, I would return it in a NewYork minute."
1,Makes terrible coffee,"Ok, I know that this is meant to be a no-frills, simple coffee maker, but the quality of the coffee that it produces is just unacceptable. Like another reviewer wrote, it doesn't heat the water hot enough to make flavorful coffee. So unless you like warm, weak coffee, stay away from this machine!The spout on my carafe didn't leak, but the carafe, itself, was rather fragile. Terrible buy. I'm returning mine tomorrow."
3,Loud AND Drippy,"This little coffeemaker works okay, but it's VERY loud--you'd think it was brewing coffee for an army. My main problem with it is the pot drips badly when I pour. There are pots out there that don't drip; you'd think that somewhere out there was engineering information that would ensure a dripless pot."
3,Mediocre coffee maker,"I like the Smartbrew for the size, but the carafe is cheap and broke easily after I turned it over and placed it on the counter on a paper towel to dry. Better yet, they don't sell 5 cup replacement carafes anywhere so I'm stuck with a coffeemaker and no carafe. Very frustrating!"
2,No cut Off - carafe leaks when pouring.,"I bought this product to replace the same product which had developed considerable leaks and eventually quit working. The carafe leaks when pouring. From reading the reviews, I see that this has been an ongoing problem. Why have they not fixed that problem?This product does not have an automatic cut off like the previous model. This was not clear when I bought it. It's too much trouble for me to pack it up and send it back. I ordered a cheap product and that's what I got."
3,somewhat disappointed,"I bought this little coffeemaker for my college-aged daughter. She said she loved it for the small cups she could make in a hurry, but it broke in less than a year--I think! She says it's been almost 2 yrs., so maybe I'm wrong. Just to be sure, though, I think I'll try another brand since I now have to buy her another coffeemaker!"
1,Not As Advertised,"I bought this product to replace one that had broken that I really liked. I had to return this product THREE times because it does NOT (as it says in the description) come with the perfect pour carafe which is what I wanted since the standard carafe drips EVERYWHERE. On the third time of returning it, I asked why they kept sending me the wrong carafe and they said that the perfect pour was discontinued in this size. I then mentioned to Amazon that they might want to remove that part of the description, but they have not."
2,Faulty Carafe,"The Carafe design on this coffeemaker is not very good. No matter how careful or how I adjust my grip, water/coffee leaks from the top and down the side. I have to place a towel under it to prevent a puddle on my counter."
1,A Bad Buy,"After 6 months of use, the LED switch popped out of the coffeemaker's base, which turned the wired plug into an on/off device. I found that Black & Decker no longer services these products and the firm that does doesn't respond to e-mail."
2,Very dispointed,"while true it doesn't drip like others when pouring coffee, but nothing else about it is up to par. First it doesn't use a gold-tone filter basket, or will one fit. The standard filters I got were a bit too big. Okay those are things that are livable, but it took very long to make a pot of coffee compared to my other 4 cup makers I've had. Last the coffee it made was not very good. I would say continue looking."
1,not worth it!,This had to be the worst movie I have ever seen in my life!! the message was nothing that acting was horrible! Just the worst movie possible!
2,Too close to home to be funny,"Motherhood is a good movie, but it doesn't offer the kind of outrageous laughs needed to make it truly funny.While I think stay-at-home moms (and some dads) will be able to relate, it is simply too close to home to be laugh-out-loud funny. Films like this need to take the ordinary chuckles and stresses of life and make them outrageous - so much so that audiences will laugh constantly.Motherhood doesn't do that.If you need to vent about parenthood and your friends aren't available, rent this movie and it will likely make you feel better. If you are looking for laughs, look elsewhere."
2,Can I get my time back?,"This movie kept plodding on and I kept waiting for it to get better. It doesn't!I think this should be required viewing for high-risk teens as I think it would do a lot to reduce unwanted pregnancies. As beautiful as Uma Thurmond is, there is nothing attractive about her in this movie. It showed no joy of motherhood -- at all! Definitely a downer for marriage and parenthood.I want my 1.5 hours back!"
1,94 Minutes I'll never get back,"Don't be fooled by that 5-star review. This could have been extremely funny, but it was not at all. I am a mother and think my day-to-day life can be humorous at times, but the humor is way too contrived and the actors are trying too hard to be funny. The whole thing made me cringe. My husband went to bed after 10 minutes, I should have gone with him."
3,Average,"Nice gloves, comfortable. But they could be thicker. Better for the BBQ and not the fireplace or stove. Well made."
2,Just OK,The gloves seem a bit light on the thermal insulation resulting is a short working time before the heat penetrates. I use these gloves with my smoker to switch out grates. The major drawback is the leather surface is not easily keep clean and is a sanitary issue when handling food.
1,Fireplace Gloves,"I used the gloves for a month, it's falling apart at the seams. The inner lining is also falling apart. Don't buy it."
1,Poor Heat Resistance for the Grill,Maybe these are good for loading wood into a fireplace but they are not very protective if you have anything very hot on the grill. I was using a steel vegetable basket on the grill and when I went to remove it with this mitt it started to burn through the mitt in seconds.Pick up the seven dollar black Webber grill mit intead. I couldn't feel the heat at all when I picked up the vegetable basket using that mitt.
2,Fingertips too small for me. Quality control issues.,"These gloves are designed in the US but manufactured in China. When I first opened up the packaging to put the gloves on, I noticed that the palm of the glove had a 1/4"" hole in it. The packaging had no damage, so I suspect a quality control issue with the source in China (shocker). They also smell like fertilizer, which isn't a very good sign.My biggest complaint with these gloves is that the fingertips were way too small. My pinky and ring fingers needed another 1/2 to 1 inches of extra length. As such, I couldn't articulate very well with the gloves on. The gloves are made of suede leather and are lined with a fur at the hand (hopefully it's not synthetic or it could melt on your hand). There doesn't appear to be any insulation other than the leather and the fur, so I'm not too confident that these are well insulted for dealing with really hot items. For carrying wood and tending a fire I'm sure they're just fine."
2,Didn't Last !,Worked great for a few BBQs then they no longer held out the heat. Thought they'd be an answer to my prayers...Bummer
4,excellent but not all that my husband hoped,The gloves are indeed excellent in that the cuff is long enough to protect when working with the grill.But they are not insulated to grab hot items off the grill as hoped.
3,"Decent BBQ Glove, But Not Fot Handling Very Hot Items","Stitching color is not as pictured. Mine was a pink/purple color that doesn't look anything like the photo. The gloves are built well, but they are NOT suitable for handling very hot objects directly, such as handling a cast iron pot/pan from a BBQ pit.Welders gloves would probably be a better option if you want to work closer to the fire."
2,Just ok...,"These didn't hold up to the heat as well as I would have liked. I got these for BBQ'ing, and the heat penetrated through the glove too much to protect against burns. They also have a very hot PINK logo on them, which I was not expecting. My mother got me a pair from LL Bean as a gift, which are great."
3,Not for use with cast iron on the grill!,"I purchased these exclusively for grilling use. According to the other reviews, these are great for grilling. However, they must not have used this with cast iron on the grill. We have the lodge logic cast iron fajita plates that we use all the time. My husband tried to grab one of these off the grill using one of these mitts and the cast iron branded the leather and burned his hand immediately. So they may be good for regular grilling or the fireplace, I'm not sure, I just know that if you grill with cast iron or cook with cast iron...these are not for you."
2,Nothing special,"I expected to be able to use these as oven mitts indoors as well as outdoors to replace the welders gloves I usually use. These are lighter and may be good for outside use but I have already found out the hard way (ouch), they are to light for use as a pot holder."
5,fire resistant gloves,gloves worked well. I bought them so my son in law could add wood to the fire with out burning his arm.
5,A scary portrait of what is likely to happen to Tokyo,"I have two copies of this book -- one at home and one at the office. I plan to use it as a handy reference for when the ""Big One"" hits Tokyo for my reporting. Hadfield, a geologist-turned-journalist has done his homework and paints a very sober picture of the ramifications from a huge quake in Japan on the people who live here and the world economy."
5,TNA AWESOME,"TNA SLAMMAVERSITY WAS ONE OF THE BEST PPVS EVER IN WRESTLING, CAUSE TNA IS WRESTLING, PEOPLE GET THIS DVD ITS WORTH MONEY, ME AND MY WIFE ORDER IT ON PPV THE WHOLE NIGHT WE CHANTED TNA TNA TNA SO GO GET IT"
5,Great Kreg demonstration for homebuilders,This dvd gives great examples how to add productivity while adding craftsmanship to interior carpentry projects. Gary Striegler is a verteran builder with superb carpentry skills and communicates clearly why this product is a must have for all carpenters and builders.
1,Shame on you Kreg,I own the Kreg pocket hole system and love it. I wanted something to show more uses and designs so I purchased this and the cabinet DVD. There is nothing on her that is not in the regular instruction manual. A total waste of my time and money. Shame on you Kreg for having such a great product and producing such a worthless help aid.
3,3 stars for Promo-grade,Don't pay anything for this...Kreg should give it away to anyone wanting it. And they do in some kit-buys. It is a good promotional DVD. Go to the Kreg site for essentially the same thing free! Plus a lot more. I did not buy my copy.
3,Pretty good video; frustrating DVD,"This video is pretty well done, and I would have given it 4 stars. However, the DVD will not let you resume play where you stopped, and it forces you to sit through a boring and lengthy introduction every time you go back to watch another chapter. Terrible DVD production."
4,Good companion to any Kreg kits,This DVD really should be part of all Kreg kits or at least kits that are over $100. It is actually a very decent primer on the use of the Kreg pocket hole system. The DVD quality is excellent. It covers the most popular applications of this kind of joinery without getting bogged down on the step-by-step how to. It hit the right balance.The only problem with this DVD is the camera work. It seems at times the cameraman was struggling with where to point the camera at. He should have focus more on the tool working rather the host talking.
3,"Okay, not great.","This DVD is okay as a product demo. I've really enjoy pocket hole construction; the Kreg line is excellent. Kreg should spend the money on DVDs to better display the quality of the products with hands-on, detailed instructions."
5,cool game!,"This is truly a good GB game. It has Mario and wario fighting the enemy one at a time. if you like any Mario or Wario adventure game, you'll like this one."
4,Easy to Use,This item got used immediately upon receipt and it was so easy and simple to use. I was glad it included batteries but I wonder if they could also include the AC adapter as the input was there for one.
2,"Tedious, sorry.","I have to say I'm disappointed by this book. It's not terrible, but it's not great. Sigh. The writing is OK, but not compelling. I don't know, but it seems like it's written by a straight person trying to explain gay culture to straight people. The dialogue often does not ring true. Also, the author does not seem to have any grasp of the reality of a grieving spouse. There are inconsistencies, like at the end of one chapter when the protagonist comes to think he's being framed, and then in the next chapter he seems to have to discover that all over again. Tedious. I really am sorry. Maybe the next ones are better, and the writer learns as he goes."
2,did not want to buy the next one,"I thought it would be better, more exciting, more heart breaking. I had a hard time feeling that there was any real hurt coming from the main character and the relationship seemed to come out of no where. I found myself skipping around trying to finish without waisting more time. In the end I did not buy the next book because I did not care what happened. I am usually one who will read anything...and I am always tempted to read the next one even if the first was bad...not here"
3,Cliche Mystery,"There is a good mystery story here, but isn't the middle age angst about coming out of the closet getting to be cliche? All this obsession with me, me, me and what will everyone think about me if they know I'm gay is better suited to a fifteen year old than a 30 something professional. It got in the way of a good story. And I don't know if it is just the kindle addition but someone has had a heavy finger on the hyphen key in this story. Who in their right mind hyphenates 'be-tween', 'go-ing', 'pud-dle', 'Chero-kee' or 'be-cause' for just a few examples? When the word occurs at the end of the line I can understand that a hyphenation may be necessary but these occurred in the middle of the line. Disconcerting to say the least."
3,Lead character is best part.,"Todd Mills is a closeted television news reporter suddenly outed involuntarily. His struggle to cope amid the chaos is the best part of this book. The mystery itself is a bit disappointing, but the characters are well written and Todd's journey is worth sharing."
4,"Compelling, intriguing and fascinating Gay characters.","R.D. Zimmerman's characters live in the experiences of many a gay man or woman. The same fears and frustrations of balancing one's professional and private life are set to print eloquently in this novel. The mystery begins with the tangled web of deception woven through the life of Star reporter Todd Mills. His life on the edge of greatness tumbles in a pileof rubble forced apart by ill timed outbursts of anger, confusion, and innocence. The characters and plot speak of loss, and of guilt, the twists and turns entrap even the most cautious. To the end you really never suspect the villan. The characters are rich and well established. The representations are genuine and reflect the lives of the majority of gay persons in society. Stereotypes linger, but only as a contrast to the stark nature of the plot. Each chapter will have you yearning to read on to assist in the clean up of a very messy life. A must read"
1,terrible,"He is one of the worst musicians in the entire world.Segovia was right on when he supported parkening, wiliams and russell.but he lost his mind when he praised fisk.Absolutely no musician ship."
2,Only two DVD labels in the kit.,The kit actually consists of 40 paper CD labels and 2 DVD labels. The item description was a little misleading for me and I want to save anyone else from discovering this after the package arrives.If you want DVD labels than this is the wrong kit for you. My rating is only based on that. If they fix the description than I'm sure you'll be wondering why I wrote this.
5,Worked for Me,"I guess it doesn't work for everyone but it worked for me. I'm a female with male pattern inherited hair loss. I took before and after photos at 3 months and six months to discern any improvement. It works pretty slowly because hair grows slowly - especially when one has been dealt a bad genetic hair card.I've now used Folligen cream for 2 years. While I don't have a beautiful thick head of hair, I can style my hair again. Two years ago, I was about ready to start wearing wigs. So I am very pleased with Folligen.P.S. I tried Minoxidil and all that grew was vellus (peach fuzz) hair which fell out as soon as I stopped. The hair I got with Folligen is normal head hair."
4,Hair today,I read about this product and decided to try it on my hairline. Due to the product's blue color I usually use it at night. After I applied it my skin tingled.I see some regrowth. The hair is very fine. I hope that I see improved results upon continued use.
1,Where are the instructions???,This product arrived without any instructions whatsoever. I haven't even used it. How do I know how often? How much? Do I wash it out? Leave it in????? A mystery. Totally disappointed.
2,Folligen for eyebrow growth,"Have been using this product now for about a month. So far no change in my eyebrows. A little stinging at first but other wise no bad side effect at this time. Will continue to use a little longer,maybe it take a while to actually see any improvement."
1,Headache within minutes of application,"I bought Folligen because I'd recently noticed excessive hair fall and thought to counteract it before the damage was too great.I've used this only a handful of times, and the first time (that too, with a sparse application on my head) triggered a migraine of epic proportions. I have never had a migraine in my life before (being 34 and healthy) and I was vomiting with the severity of the headache, along with sound, light and smell hypersensitivity. Still, I hesitated that it could be this product, so I continued to use it sparingly on my eyebrows and eyelashes. I still noticed headaches, centered behind my left eye, within 15 minutes of application, though not as bad as the first time (never got the nerve to put the stuff on my head again). So no, this product is not going to be used anywhere on me and I would caution others to do so too. I have to note that headaches are rare for me, and in general, I never get weird reactions to products I try or use."
1,"just irritated, did not make any hair grow at all","Hi, I tried this because my eyelashes and eyebrows have become thin over the years. I put this on, yes it's blue, at night. All it did was irritate my eyes and did not make any hair grow. I tried it for 4 nights straight but found the itching was too much for me. In the meantime, I did get an rx for the real latisse and am using that now."
1,Folligen Hair and Scalp cream,"After doing some research on products that help regrow eye lashes, I decided to try the Folligen cream because it was much more affordable than the Lilash eyelash cream. The bottle did not have directions and there were no ingredients listed. I knew from reviews that the cream was green so it needs to be used at night and washed off in the morning. I very carefully put a small amount at my eye lash line being careful not to get any in my eye. My vision blurred after using it (I tried it more than once and the same thing happened). I decided my vision was more important than having eye lashes so I stopped using it on my eye lashes. I did try it on my eyebrows just to test it to see if it actually worked, but I stopped using it after several days when I finally identified the smell--it smelled like the chemicals used in porta-potties! I don't know if it workes or not, but I don't recommend trying it."
5,Can't stop listening to this one.....,"I am not much of a wordsmith, so I will keep it brief:Old No.2 is the type of CD that you will play over and over, singing along to the catchy tunes. This is a fun record and should appeal to fans across several musical genres.Eddie Spaghetti and friends have done it right on this one!"
3,Wrong dimensions,The accommodating dimensions of this unit are wrong. laying a ruler flat in the bottom of this case measures barely over 12 inches not close to the 13.5 advertised. So this will not work for what I need.
3,Solid bag but you are paying for the name...,"I had this product for a few years (not sure why Amazon now shows date first available as 2008, as I purchased this exact case in February of 06 (checked out my purchase history)). It served me well, as others have stated that measurements internally did not quite meet the specs but that is to be expected to some degree. I recently looked to replace it as mine was showing signs of wear.After trying out several bases I found that the Targus CPT401DUS (which can be found here: http://www.amazon.com/Targus-Blacktop-Deluxe-Protection-CPT401DUS/dp/B000X2RNO6/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&s;=office-products&qid;=1247150788&sr;=8-2) was slightly cheaper - but offered more protection and more pockets (which is never a bad thing). In addition it was one pound lighter. I truly feel that Samsonite is capitalizing on their marketing and brand recognition with the pricing of this case."
4,Easy to read and entertaining,This book takes what can be dry reading and makes it entertaining and easy to relate to. This is a very practical guide to BPR. It assisted me and my managers to examine and achieve our organizational goals. I am using this book to guide me from start to finish.
5,A Must-Read for Top Execs,"An excellent book which has been wonderfully written with the top executive in mind. It provided us with the insight and guidance to reengineer our manufacturing organization from the top down. Our organization adopted the BPR Wizdom Three-ringed philosophy, and change has never been more easy to deal with. We encourage our suppliers and customers to read this book as well. We envision a supply chain that will consistently keep our bleeding edge products and services at the throats of our competition. Thank you much BPR Wizdom."
5,An astonishing Goldberg,"This Feltsman recording is of a live performance. That alone would make it exceptional because of the flawless playing.But it has another fabulous feature: he does all the da capo repeats with his own variations on the variations.I had heard him perform it live in New York City and followed with the score. It was just astonishing how beautifully and creatively his playing of the da capo repeats enhanced the overall performance.I have many ""Goldbergs,"" including both Gould performances and this one is the best.Albert H. Cohen"
4,Photographic History of the Battle,"This is a coffee table sized collection of photographs of the persons and events of the Battle of the Bulge. Although it does contain a text with information about commanders, weapons, and the overall course of the battle, the book is mainly interested in describing what is happening in its numerous photos. Of particular interest are the photos made by the Germans. The German photographers paid close attention to the large numbers of stunned American POWs, wrecked and abandoned American vehicles, and the corpses of fallen GIs. It's a different perspective from the usual pictures of advancing and victorious Americans. Also of note is that this book finally lays to rest one of the biggest inaccuracies of the photographic record of the war- proving that the famous picture of cigar chewing SS trooper next to the Malmedy sign is NOT infamous SS Lt. Col. Jochen Peiper."
3,Good for the photos and captions,"Not the first book I would open on the Battle of the Bulge, as it is not comprehensive and a bit unbalanced. It's really a picture book, and in that respect, is worthwhile. The captions are more descriptive (and apparently accurate) than in many books. For example, the photos in a series taken by German battlefield photographers are shown to have been largely staged immediately after combat to re-enact the fighting- interesting. These photos show up in other books without that context mentioned. Those interested in the Malmedy trial will find the photos in that section noteworthy. Worth a look but not a classic for the collection unless you're really focused on the Battle of the Bulge."
5,From The Girl's Dorm At JMU,"Heard this first last weekend at one of the girls' dorms at James Madison University. The girl in charge of the stereo that night played this CD and described it as ""the wettest"" music she'd ever heard. Listening to it, the girls seemed absolutely mesmerized! My girlfriend insisted we track down a copy of our own... and I can personally attest to its effect! 'Nuff said. So spread the word! ALLISON B."
3,Different Versions of This Cd?,My copy of this cd just arrived and I was very surprised that it had a different track#2 then what was listed for both the Deluxe and standard versions of this album.Amazon lists track#2 as Thievery Corporation-Until The Morning.My cd has track#2 as Bob Harz-What We Are.Does anyone else have the version I have or the one with Thievery Corporation-Until The Morning? Would like to hear from others who own this cd.
3,"Nice music, but not what's advertised","Erotic Lounge: They're half right. It's lounge music, but I wouldn't describe it as erotic. This is a nice collection of mostly instrumental, jazzy lounge music. The only problem is that they've packaged it is as being sensual and erotic. One disc is called Quick and Dirty, while the other is Slow and Lazy. Combine this with the softcore pic on the cover of a lady's legs, high heels and undies coming off, and the message is clear. But when I put the CDs in, it just seemed like your average lounge music with lots of drum machine and synthesizer tracks. And the Quick and Dirty disc is neither quick or dirty. I wouldn't call it sexually charged at all.It's a nice collection of mostly instrumental music, but was packaged and marketed incorrectly in my opinion."
1,An uneventul failure,"This product, although it does provide a slight tightness, does not fix on the rotator cuff ligmants and tendons. As such, this product produces no benefit for the rotator inflammatory injury state."
1,doesn't seem to work for me,"This product didn't seem to work for me.. I only tried it on.. Just didn't seem to fit right. So,I didn't use it.. It is still in the package it came it. I had surgery on my left shoulder."
2,Not what is pictured,"I ordered this product based on reading the other reviews. The first thing that I found when I got the product was that is does not have the taper the photo on Amazon shows. It's just a 2"" strap from the top of the shoulder to under the arm pit of the reverse shoulder, making it not as comfortable as it appears in the photo. Second, the chemical smell of the (I think) neoprene was so overpowering, it made me light headed. I soaked it and washed it three times, before it lighted up when dry. The product helps, but is not a cure. If your shoulders are massive, this will likely be too tight for you. I give think if it was what was pictured, I would have gave it 3 stars."
1,Avoid this shoulder support and the company ATAFA,"This product comes with a rather strong oder that made it too difficult to use. It was returned to company, however this company, ATAFA, has some really annoying issues to overcome.When the package was mailed by the company to me, they shorted the posted by 33 cents - delaying its arrival and putting unnecessary work on the mail carrier and my time.ATAFA has a rather difficult customer service department that I suspect maintains English as a second language. To make a product return, be advised that two phone calls and two to three emails will be required. Returns have to preapproved before you ship the item back.I suggest avoiding this product and this company."
1,This is not the product they send you.,What's in the picture is not even close to what they send you. The product I received is essentially a neoprene tube with a strap attached to it. It provides very little support. I will try to add some images of what was actually shipped to me.
5,shoulder relief,The brace helped relieve the pain in shoulder. Should have ordered a smaller size I think it would have helped more if it fit tighter.
1,I want to throw it away!,"It is not the product we saw in the pix.It makes me uncomfortable when iwear it on.And they are not good on return service,now even i don't want to return/change it,it will cost me another twice shipping fees.I don't want to give them any stars.If it have bad star to choose,i will give them a lot."
2,repetitive,"the geniuses revisit some of the previous myths, and get similar results. Might as well skip to the third season...."
4,Explosive Decomp a total waste of time,"I call bogus waste of time for the explosive decompression part of this one. All the had to do was call the military and have them say what happens. Seriously. They're taught how to deal with stuff like this, and what happens. They even have altitude chambers to work with! What a waste of an episode. Not one of the better episodes overall, either. 'Ooo, let's prove Hollywood does fake stuff!!' Still, a good season though."
5,hole size,"Can anyone tell me how large the holes are on this punch? I have been using the economy plastic one sheet punch, specifically because it punches small holes. The ""hole"" reinforcers that you buy, don't work well with larger holes. The inner diameter is smaller than a standard punch hole and makes the pages stick together. The one I""m using for single sheets punches appx a 6 mm hole. Less than 1/4 "" . Thanks!"
4,Works well...but take one precaution..,"Works well. I have only one suggestion...Before you use it, lubricate the punches with alittle 3 in 1 or olive oil.I had to replace my first one because it was binding and it bent out of shape when I used it."
4,"Great, but not perfect","This is a perfect little hole punch for my boss' day planner.Slide the paper in, punch, and it's a perfect fit for his book.However, cardstock type paper does not fare too well. Half the time, just one 5x8 card gets stuck, and I have to sit there trying to pry it out. Also, sometimes the blades (I'll call them blades) get stuck and I have to pry them out, and that is even with a fully cleared basin.All-in-all, this is the best I have found for what I need, but it isn't perfect."
4,Works But Don't Overload It,This little punch works fine if you don't try to punch too many papers at one time. This is my second one. The first one got jammed with too many papers. I cleared the jam but the punch never worked right again and I ended up buying a second one. I wish I could find a high-end punch that would punch holes for a seven-hole classic binder but I could find none where I could adjust the punches to the correct pattern.
4,"Not bad, but would expect more for the price","It is handy to be able to punch additional papers to add to my Franklin Covey planner. However, for the price of this item I would like for it to be able to punch more than 3 or 4 sheets at a time. I would purchase this items again anyway, just because it is very useful."
2,Shoddy Workmanship,"I received this product in a very timely fashion from Amazon, only to find it would not work because one of the seven punch hole mounts wasn't properly secured to the base. The unit wouldn't even accept paper! I am returning it for a replacement (hopefully quality-verified) punch. I expect more from a company with the name recognition associated with Franklin Covey."
5,Perfect Hole Punch,"This is a great little hole punch, and definitely worth the money. Unlike the cheaper plastic ones, this one is sturdy, heavy, and easily punches through your papers for insertion into your Franklin Covey planner."
3,Great Tool,"Would be 5-star great, but it arrived damaged. One corner of the rubber pad/tray was split in the corner and down one side (about 1/4 inch). Rather than return it, we decided we could fix it and would rather start using it right away. It works very well, and I used black electrician's tape to pull together the split corner of the tray so that it holds firmly to the metal puncher.Overall a very good purchase."
2,Sub-par quality,Horrible quality. Out of the box the plastic tray is split at the edges and the alignment of the punch is off.I honestly expected much better with the Franklin name on it.........
1,"Looks great, poor quality","I have owned two of these, and both have broken within a few months of usage.There must be an inherent design flaw, because I never punched more than 3 pieces of thin paper at a time.We tried to fix the first one, and couldn't. The second one, we oiled (as several have mentioned) but it put oil on the paper and the item still broke within months.The fact that these are being sold for far less than their original cost, tells you something:AVOID this product."
2,Stiff and only does 2 sheets at a time,"If you need to punch multiple sheets at a time, this is going to be very frustrating for you. I've had a 7-hole punch before that was much better."
3,Works well....but....,"I think the punch works well but it only punches a couple of sheets at a time (maybe 3 max). Why go to the trouble of designing a hole punch and not have it sized to punch five or six sheets at a time? It is a heavy piece of equipment but the clearance between the punches is not large enough for more paper. Other than that, works great."
1,DXM,This is a guide which tells you what happens when you take too much cough syrup.An the writer is dead too?Sounds like a warning to me...
5,Excellet Highly Recommended,"This CD is excellent. It brings peace and joy into your life if you allow yourself time to meditate at least once a day. I have been able to release barriers, resistance which has brought clarity to my mind."
3,Not the best,"Well, the Meditation is not bad at all, but what i did not like, is that every time you start the CD, he talks about why he made this CD and how to use it. I really dont need to hear it every time i want to meditate. So, thats annoying. I honestly prefer Louise Hay's Meditation, because she gets right into it when you put CD on. I will give this meditation another chance, just because everyone here seems to like it."
5,I loved this!,"This is a meditation that is great for all members of the family. It really helps you look deep into why you are ""worth it"". It makes you feel good about yourself and have a greater love for yourself and therefore others."
2,Half Worked,"Wanted to check the wiring diagram for my car as advertised on the packaging, the web site only wants to sell you that kind of information. The power connector works, the speaker connector is not for the system in the T-6 Volvo S80, but to be fair Volvo has made it almost impossible to use after-market stereo's. I would never buy one of their cars again even though I learn a lot because it needs to be repaired all the time and I do it myself."
5,great tool for getting what you're worth,"I have used many of the techniques in this book. it has definitely placed me on a ""virtuous cycle"" (as opposed to the vicious cycle). I now have the kind of job I always wanted, at a compensation level that makes me feel valued. because I feel valued, I work harder which is rewarded with other perks and bonuses. the list goes on...I have given this book as gift to many friends looking for jobs out of college as an introduction to negotiating for a job or as a way to help my more experienced associates get the job they deserve.highly recommended."
2,Seems outdated and not very useful,The book tries to be funny and useful but does not meet either standard (at least in my opinion). I would not recommend buying it. There are better alternatives out there.
4,don't get fooled!,"my best friend loves it, and i used to think it was dumb, but after i saw the movie it was so cool! so don't get fooled! And when i saw the book i just had to have it!"
4,Spiderwick's Guide,My grandson age 10 specifically requested this book for his birthday. He is a talented artist himself & the illustrations in this book are very inspirational. He has been immersed in the wonderful world of Harry Potter & now is into the Spiderwick Chronicles.
5,Beautiful!,The artwork in this book is absolutely incredible! Every page is a delight for the eyes and no doubt will be treasured by lucky children everywhere for years to come! Gorgeous work-you couldn't possibly be disappointed in this book!!
5,Italian Rap 101,"An incredible album, for anyone interested in Italian Rap, this is the first album you should buy. Even better than their previous three albums, DJ Jad shows off his knack for innovative sampling with old notable Italian songs. J-Ax's flow (dope in general) is especially impressive on Il Mondo Dove Vivo. Tons of feel good tunes, especially Fidanzata and Venerdi. If you understand Italian, check Nessuno and Come uno su mille, they just make you think. However, regardless of whether you understand Italian or not, it is worth buying (I learned Italian through listening to music)."
1,Blank folders,I received blank folders. No labels or print on on the folders as shown in the pictures advertised. Probably a mistake.
1,Wouldn't buy again,I was very disappointed in these folders. I had bought a set from a local office supply store and thought I'd be getting the same thing. I think I got a box of rejects. Most of the print was washed out and some folders were missing most of the print.
4,a romantic floral fragrance,"This is one of the early women's fragrances launched by Boucheron. It is more dramatic than Initial, highlighted by a floral Oriental tone.Jaipur or ""jewel"" was inspired by a trip made by the company's current president's grandfather to Jaipur, a city whose reputation for precious stones was legendary. Thus, the fragrance was introduced in a jewel flacon. The original bottles are, of course, highly prized by collectors today.Long recognized as makers of elegrant, luxurious jewelry Boucheron began in 1830 when the first store opened in Paris. It was not until 1988 that the first Boucheron fragrance was launched."
3,Adequate,"I was introduced to this product because my grandparents were told by their doctor to get a machine so they could monitor their own blood pressures. When the got this particular machine, they called me to come over and make sure they were using it correctly since I am in the medical field.The machine itself was pretty easy to understand what to do and the directions were pretty clear. The only problem I had was that the bulb that you have to inflate proved to be extremely difficult for my grandparents to use because of the arthritis in their hands. This meant that either I had to take it or my grandmother had to inflate the cuff with one hand while the cuff was placed on the other arm. This posed her with some questions about the reliability of the readings.While this may seem like a pretty simple machine to operate, if you have any hand problems, this is probably not the machine for you."
4,Highly Addictive,"Donkey Kong is a highly addictive game. Mario is the main hero, and unlike the other Donkey Kong games, Donkey Kong is the villan. It is a highly addictive game, and has a good plot. It get's very tricky at times but that makes it even more fun."
4,Still fun,"The day this came in the mail I stayed up most of the night to finish this game because the battery to save my progress understandably no longer works. It is even more fun than the original game because there are so many more levels, with the last level being by far the hardest. Even though all the levels have the same goal there is still a lot of variance in the level design to keep things interesting. If you like Donkey Kong and still have a game boy, or super game boy, you should pick this up."
5,A Classic,"This is one game everyone should try. Inspired by the original 1981 arcade game,Donkey Kong expands on the original game by adding more moves, better graphics, more enemies, levels and overall fun! This game alone helped inspire the creation of the Mario vs Donkey Kong series. It is great for Mario fans and gamers alike. I would recommend this game to anyone with a GameBoy or GameBoy game compatible handheld."
5,Love this collection!,"Nest videos are awesome! I was first introduced to these 15 years ago when our first was born. We had them on VHS and glad to replace those with new DVD's. The Good Samaritan has always been a favorite with all the kids. The animation is nice and well done, and the stories are beautifully told."
2,Poor quality control.,The company sent a different DVD than what the case said. It hadn't been checked properly before it was sent.
3,Go Speed Racer,Though technically well done I felt like I was on the race track at Indy. To me this recording was just an race against the metronome. These pieces were not written for the guitar and may not transcribe well no matter who does the work. This is one of the least played discs in my collection.
1,Absolutely Awful,"I'm a classical guitar student at a major conservatory. Though many are wowed by this record, I find it to be quite terrible. Sure, his fingers can move, I'll give him that, but are we worried about quality or quantity? It is about how fast he can get the notes out, or how rhythmically and musically accurate he can be? According to the other reviews here, it's clearly just about speed. This whole CD is horribly sloppy - it sounds completely out of control, like a train about to crash at any moment. There are serious rhythmic issues, and his tone is simply unbearable (like it is on most of Fisk's recordings). He clearly is not able to play these pieces as fast as he tries to, and I personally would rather hear them taken alittle slower and have them be clean, rather than have them fly by out of control. It's really unfortunate that speed is what impresses people in the guitar world (classical AND rock), while musicianship seems to be unimportant."
2,"A quirky, readable disappointment","This was the first book I've read by this author and I purchased it based on reviews such as the ones here. I generally like quirky and unusual and I certainly don't need a happily ever after kind of an ending but I found while I was reading I kept saying to myself, I hope this is all headed somewhere....These characters were odd with very little to redeem them and I felt, in the end, most unsatisfied. I would not recommend this book unless you know the reading taste of the person to whom you are recommending it."
3,should be better known,"Beryl Bainbridge is quite popular in England and should be better known in the US. Her work is erratic in quality and tone, but never uninteresting."
3,Unusual book,"A bit strange. A story of English bottle factory workers and their interactions, meant to represent the modern urban reality. Interesting as an allegory of women's status in society, but not very engaging or convincing."
3,Not in MY top 100!,"I read this because I was googling lists of 100 best novels, and it happened to be on somebody's list. Must have been the author's. It certainly didn't earn a place on mine.It's an interesting enough story with well-drawn characters, but is about on the level of an Alfred Hitchcock story--might have made a nice episode on his old TV show. I have to wonder why anyone would put in the labor to turn such lightweight material into a novel, but I suppose that could be said of over 90% of the novels that manage to get themselves published."
4,excellent portrayal of down side of life,"beryl bainbridge is excellent in her droll, very british sarcastic way of portraying people on the down side of life, no matter how hard they try to get a leg up over the edge separating htem from any kind of true happiness or even an hones tunderstanding of themselves, something or someone is always there to push them back down. very sad ending becuase you hjave to have regret at seeing the real waste of a death is the way the person lived their life before it ended. very good story"
2,Good if you know nothing about teaching with the arts,"This book is set up as a text book, with anticipatory guides, questions and activities for the reader to do. I was expecting a book with too many ideas, but instead this book is for those that aren't familiar with the arts or how to incorporate them into the classroom. There are better books out there, and this is more of a stroking of the authors' worth than anything else. I was very disappointed with this book.If you have no clues about what art is or how to use it in your lessons, than this book is for you, but if you have any background using art at all, ignore this book."
5,An excellent suppliment to the Heller's Program,"The Hellers (co-authors of ""The Carbohydrate Addicts Diet"") have created an interactive guide for those using their diet plan. This is not a book of tips on how to use their diet plan, but a book that assists the dieter in understanding why they eat, and overeat, the wrong foods. Instead of focusing on the mechanics of diet, the dieter's other concerns: family reactions, childhood patterns, and self-esteem issues are evaluated. This is *not* a stand alone book, you will need to obtain one of the Heller's other books to understand their controlled carbohydrate diet, but if you are on the Heller's diet program, this book is indispensible."
1,"Disappointed, was no help for me. A waste of my money.","I was looking for a book that would give me guidance to diet, not one that was meant to analysis my feelings like going to a head doctor. It was a real disappointment and a waste of my hard earned money. Other books by the Heller's are of more benefit."
4,GPS Companion - Recommended,"I've used this handy GPS with a Visor Prism for a few weeks and am pleased. It works on the ground, in a moving car, and even in a plane. Satellite acquisition time varies, but is acceptable, sometimes even indoors, and retention is fine. It a plane, it quickly locked on to the heading and tracked the climb to 39000 feet and air speed increase to 519 mph with rapid latitude/longitude updates. That's good enough for me. The software supports color and the maps are concise. Ground tracking is also quite satisfactory though, like others, I would prefer some way to avoid the tedium of having to download a route county by county. But this is a handheld after all. Battery life seems a little less than claimed, so carry spares."
4,A Pretty Good GPS Springboard Module,"First of all, I would recommend getting different GPS software, such as Atlass or Tracker by GPS Pilot ... for the software that comes with Magellan GpS Companion Stinks. .... You will have to give it a few minutes to find the satelites before it will start tracking you. I found it so far pretty accurate,but remember no GPS is going to be real accurate (say less than a foot). It will not get you lost and the accuracy is good enough that you won't notice it. There are three reasons I didn't give it 5 out 5, one is what I mention above about the bundle software. The second reason is that it eats batteries, the GPS Companion & the Visor, so I would recommend you take extra batteries if you plan on going out for a hike in the great outdoors. The third is that it doesn't have a belt clip, while this doesn't seem to be a big problem it would have been nice to have it hands free."
2,don't buy if you live in hawaii,i read two reviews from hawaii and both mention severe inaccuracies with the unit. i thought by now it would have been fixed so i decided to pick one up. my readings are constantly off by several hundred feet to a half mile. an email to magellan got no response. i ended up getting software from handmap.net which allows you to manually calibrate where you are on the map...but you need to manually calibrate from time to time to stay accurate.
3,Magellan GPS,"I have a Visor Deluxe. The GPS unit appears to work ok, but at times takes a while to get a fix even though it may have several channels active. Once it get's a fix, it does work pretty well.The map software is ok. Having to load maps by county is not the preferred method as I don't always know the counties that I'll be in. I'd like to see state maps to cover major interstates and primary roads and then pointers as to which maps are needed for more details.The unit seems to loose its connection to my Visor Deluxe at times, but this could be due to OS 3.1 on my Visor. I need to get more experience with it, but do see its value."
3,Somewhat disappointed in the technology,"I bought this GPS for my husband for his birthday to go with his Handspring Visor Deluxe. Apparently it is extremely difficult to get a fix where we live. It seems to be more sensitive when the sky is overcast as well.I really like the maps. However, I have not been able to figure out how to integrate them with the GPS tracking. It may be possible but I don't think it is the most user friendly device.I think Magellan's GPS is one of the better ones out there, but I think my expectations were a lot higher than what I recieved.I do not want to put down the product but I want to let other users know what to expect so they are not disappointed as we were.Happy Journeys!"
1,Impossible to use,"Worse than your VCR remote control. A nightmare to program. Also you have to preload a map before you can see it. Considering people use GPS when they are lost, how does one predict when and where one will be lost?! ..."
5,Works Great!!!,"I purchased the Magellan GPS Companion. I'm very pleased with its performance. When I'm outside it receives nearly every available satilite in position. The software that comes with it works great if you want to know where you are, But, it doesn't tell you how to get there. So, I purchased ... Rand McNally Street Finder Deluxe. The GPS Companion and Streetfinder Deluxe work great together. ... GPS + ... Software makes a great pair."
4,"get updates from magellan website for map display, etc.","do NOT use firmware update - it trashed my GPS and I had to hassle an exchange.So, DON'T load ANYTHING from the CD included EXCEPT MAPS - and do THAT after you load all the updates from the MFG website, EXCEPT DO NOT use the update labeled ""gps updater"" that they tell you to download to the unit - delete it - do not run it.You will be VERY happy with the new software for GPS and MAPS.The unit is fantastic"
3,Works but Don't buy for Hawai`i maps,The GPS module works as advertised and the software is easy to use. My main objection is that the Hawai`i maps are not correctly projected to be in the same datum as the coordinates that the GPS module is acquiring. Therefore there is a nearly constant shift of several hundred to almost 1000 feet between your GPS position and your correct position on the Hawai`i maps. I have emailed Magellan twice about this problem and have never received any response.
4,Great Product,"I was highly impressed with this product. I read other reviews that say it had difficulity obtaining a signal...no problems here. I also own a Garmin 'stand alone' GPS, this seems to be much more accurate. The included mapping software has a little to be desired, but it does work great with a third party software. With the ease of use, ability to obtain a strong signal (even indoors), and practically, I highly recomend this product."
1,Disappointed in Magellan GPS for Handspring,"The interface is clunky and entirely non-intuitive, and furthermore the documentation is not helpful in getting started. The maps are hard to read (OK, it is a handheld device). I could have managed to live with all this, but my patience ran out when I could never get the unit to initialize on a location. The numbers kept flashing, flashing, flashing while I prepared to return this unit. Still no fix, so back it went. I'm disappointed because the idea is great, but I'll wait until the product improves before wasting my time with it."
1,Poor locking capability while hiking.,"Long (+15 min) waits to lock onto satallites in WVA. Was only able to lock & hike once. Fatal crash while hiking & was unable to lock on again. We were hiking in the mountains with heavy leaf cover. Literature claims it will track you anywhere, Hah. Probably would work ok in open areas. Wouldn't want to rely on this gadget in an emergency!"
5,nice detail,"I like the detail and the cloth cloak and accessories, great for collecting. I am keeping it in the box."
4,Beautiful (Deluxe Version),I just recently discover Ryan Farish. His music is truly beautiful and relaxing. My favorite singles are Carried by the Wind and Full Sail.
1,"Very good whatsup with ""Carried by the Wind""?","I picked up this cd after listening to some samples. Very good, I enjoyed most every song, except ""Carried by the Wind."" When I first heard it seemed disconcertingly familier, as if I'd heard it before. I listened a few more times, and YES, I HAD HEARD IT BEFORE. It's a reworked version of Yanni's ""On Sacred Ground"" from his ""If I Could Tell You"" album!!! I listened to Yanni's version and Farish's version most definitely copies from that song!! But not only that, Farish also inserted the same clip of children laughing that Amethystium uses in their song ""Avalon"" from their ""Odonata"" album. What's up with that? Unless there's good explanation for this copying, the song ""Carried by the Wind"" has ruined Ryan Farish for me."
5,Beautiful,"First time buyer of Farish music. I like it and play it often. I also purchased at the same time, ""From the Sky,"" love it as well. Hope to see more work from this artist."
2,Great music but lose the drummer,"No matter how we set the balance, there is a constant drum beat through all the music that detracts from the music. Sorry to say this but I had recommended it on my Facebook page but took it down after listening to it a couple times. The drum beat was far too dominant and repetitive. Otherwise I would say that the music was beautiful!"
5,Fully recommended!!!,"I first heard a song from this CD on Pandora and liked it so much I decided to find out who the musician was. I then heard the samples on this page and decided to give it a shot. Received the CD and have been playing it over and over. I find it very refreshing and modern. I'm pretty sure this is the first of many more CDs from Ryan Farish that I'll get. Now I'm checking out some of his other works.If you like modern instrumental music with a twist, you'll definitely enjoy this one! I fully recommend it!!"
4,Outsourced is definitely better,"This is Russell Peter's older comedy routine. It's not as funny as Outsourced. If you're a fan, then you probably wouldn't mind spending extra money to see this too."
3,Good standup comedy,"The comedy is nice, but after some time it is bit of the same thing- picking on different nationalities. Even Outsourced is the same thing. More than watching it on DVD, I think having it on CD and listening to it in the car, after a long day at office, would be a better idea."
1,NO proceeds to go Russell Peters,As the previous reviewer mentioned: this is *unlicensed* material and RP gets NO money from it. Please don't purchase this if you wish to support the artist!
2,huge russell fan disappointed in old material,"i am a huge russell peters fan, ive seen him in both canada and washington d.c., and i must say i was really disappointed with these older shows, they just didnt measure up to the level ive come to expect from him...if youre a fan stick with the outsourced dvd and his newer material, this just isnt worth the money"
5,Top bass instructional DVD,"Terrific exercises, with examples played by Prof. Vitti, plus split screen films of his top playing. If you are disciplined and willing to stick with the lessons sequentially, this is one of the best I've seen. Its only flaw is the very tiny booklet of the music and exercises. You need a magnifier to follow the notes or tabs."
3,I am not a great one to review this product...,"I am not a musician, but I know someone with the same name... bought this product as a gag. He is a musician, and a bass player. He was not very impressed with the DVD, but thought it was very ironic that his name and same instrument that he plays was on a DVD label... :-) Do not take my review as an endosement or criticism of this DVD. I do not have a musical background to judge this product."
2,Where's the study guide?,"It's a good text for Precalculus as long as you have someone along to check your work, the CD is basically useless. The first two chapters don't load some of the animations due to Java errors on Windows, and there are no practice tests on the CD. The answers in the back are fine, as long as you know how to get them. This version DESPERATELY needs the study guide."
2,read quality,Not really a good read. More a document compilation with redacted content. It's an interesting reference book but not really a good description of the program or the outcomes or the political environment around it.
4,The Complete Solo Piano Music,"This is a great selection of music. However, this album cannot officially be called complete for two reasons. Only the first interlude is included, and secondly the Souvenirs, which are beautiful pieces, are absent. Besides that, great performance by Browning, and beautiful composing, of course, by Samuel Barber."
5,Ceres,"I really enjoyed watching this series. I found the story line very interesting all the way through. I won't explain it because the other reviewers did a good enough job of that. It was hard to stop watching once I got started because every episode ends with sort of a cliff hanger. It was well worth watching and the money I spent buying it. The music is good, too. The opening theme, Scarlet, has got to be one of the prettiest theme songs I have ever heard. The DVDs I own have an interview Yu Watase in Japanese (of course) with subtitles, a character gallery, and other things. Over all, Ceres is another great series inspired by Yu Watase's work. Whether you like FY or not, you should definitely check this out. Rent it if you are really unsure about it, but I suggest buying it."
5,The most amazing anime I've seen`,"Finally! Dubbing that doesn't stink! I absolutely adore this anime. The storyline is so twisted it keeps you on the edge of your seat the entire time, and it's not all mushy mushy either. Definitely recommend it to any anime fan, particularly the fan that enjoys a tainted love story!"
3,Manga was better...,"I hate to admit this, but the manga of this anime was def better. The art is more detailed and the story is more fast paced. The story for the anime was kind of slow paced, and at first I thought that the animation was a little choppy...I bought all 8 vols on amazon, and it was pretty cheap. I'm glad it was cheap. Honestly, if it had been expensive, I don't see me buying an actual boxset.Yes, the story is very interesting, and I remember reading the manga, that's why I bought the anime in the first place... but I think they could've done a better job with the animation, the artwork looks like it was quickly put together and such....I recommended buying all 8 vols on dvd off of Amazon, because again that's where I bought mine AND it was pretty cheap for 8 discs.... about a little over 30$.I won't give up any of the story because loads of others already did that for me, lol."
2,Eh.,"Even though I liked Fushigi Yugi (to a point... all that ""Tamahome!"" ""Miaka!"" stuff gets on your nerves...), I didn't much care for this series. It wasn't BAD, but I was a bit bored with it. I thought the romance between Aya and that one guy is contrived, and starts out a bit too early (the first kiss in the tree scene). I just know this is going to be a gushy melodramatic romance.The best thing is the plotline about Aya's special powers, and her wicked family, but I thought that could have been better too. One scene that didn't make sense was when Aya's mother attacks Aya in a hospital... why was her mother cutting apples in the hospital room?! It would have made more sense if they had the scene at Aya's house... how would her mother be able to bring a big kitchen knife into a hospital in the first place??This isn't a series I would care enough about seeing again, but my sister will probably make me watch it anyway... she loves this sort of stuff..."
1,Buggy,"After filling out everything, when I try to e-file, it pops up a dialog box saying ""We're sorry.The software you have used for preparing the Tax return is not properly installed...Please re-install the software"".On spending hours with customer service(avg wait = 44 mins), they asked me to delete some files which were not installed by TurboTax at all!Moreover, they even insisted that I install the software in Safe Mode!I'm going to return my copy to Costco."
1,System Problems,"I have used Turbo Tax for the past 5 years and had been very pleased with it. This year, however, I had major problems with my system after loading it. After loading the program I lost all icons on the desktop and had to get instructions on restoring my system. Then, when I tried to use Money I was given the error message that the Program and the files were corrupted. I tried uninstalling Money and reinstalling to no avail. My backup disk also did not work. I then had to call Microsoft to help me correct my problem. This is the first time I have ever had a problem that I had to get assistance on. I also called Intuit and they thought it might have been a faulty disk but were not very helpful. Because of the problems incurred I will NOT try the 2001 version again."
3,Netscape users BEWARE,"I have used, and have been quite happy with TurboTax for three years. When I re-installed this year, I noticed that Internet Explorer was being automatically installed. As is my habit, I uninstalled it, then found that TurboTax would not run without it. I looked on Intuit's customer support site, and the topic of Internet Explorer was their number one FAQ for TurboTax. Customer Support's response was that ""you can uninstall Internet Explorer after you file your taxes"". Forget that! No credible explanation as to WHY other browsers are not supported. I don't like being forced to use a different browser."
1,Another Rebate Tickle Scam,"Over Priced, banking on people not sending in rebate. For a financial program that brags about saving you money, whats up with giving them money upfront just to have them save it, earn interest on it, then mail it back after 2 to 6 months. Have to trust that downloading will work. Charges almost 6 dollars if you want a CD copy. If your puter crashes within the year and it's lost you have no program. Too big unless you burn a CD backup. And then wait till you get audited !!! No program, just a big smile for the tax man when he comes.SignedFleeced by IRS & Intuit"
3,"Pretty good, with some calculation and interface errors","Having used the web version of Turbo tax last year, I used it again this year. I was dismayed to find a couple of errors in their program, which made me wonder if there are more. The cover sheet incorrectly calculates the ""Effective Tax Rate"". Additionally, when filing IL state taxes, the system insisted that I would be filing late and that I would have to pay a penalty for that (even though it is mid-March as I write). Other than that it seemed to work well. Unfortunately those couple of errors did leave me with a niggling doubt regarding the rest of the calculations..."
3,Good product/Bad rebate policy,"I have used TurboTax for the past three years and have been pleased with the product. However, if you plan to take advantage of the rebates, get ready to jump through a lot of hoops. It takes far too much time and effort to claim the three seperate rebates (Federal, State, and electronic filing fee). I've had enough and will not be using the product in the future."
1,Installation Problems,"I've used Turbo Tax for several years now, but never again. The original installation messages were disconcertingly wrong about my system. Once installed, when I tried to do the one-click updates I got an alert that said simply ""One-click updates problem. . ."" -- nothing else, no clue. When I downloaded the manual updates, they seemed to install - finished with ""OK"", but when I went into TT, I got a message ""TT has detected patches that are not installed."" I went to the support site - nada. Tried their live advisor -- could not connect. Other support options included: $14.95/minute for advise on a non-working product or 45 minute wait for free support. Who has time or $ for these things? If television had started like this, we'd still be listening to radio. I checked the message boards and found that I seem to be one of the lucky ones -- TT doesn't work, but my system still does."
1,Caution if you are using this product with Win 2000,"In the past this was a great product. However, I found the 2001 product version to be very unstable running under Win 2000. It caused numerous program crashes, resulting in lost data and time. Eventually I had to go with another program."
1,Smells Horrible - not like pine,"I opened the bottle to smell it and quickly pulled it away from my nose. I immediately took it to my wife and asked her to smell it and to tell me what she thinks it smells like. She looked at me and said ""like old people."" I said that is EXACTLY what I thought, too.I had already poured some in our 10 gallon humidifier. Now, our whole house smells like an old folks home. Not trying to be mean on the elderly in any way, but everyone knows ""that smell."""
4,OK,its well its gr8 i think ITS THE BEST U GOT TO GET THIS IF U LIKE THIS KIND OF MUSIC HEHEHEHEHEHHE
4,Necessary Accessory,Got the Warn XT40 and so glad I got the accessory kit. To use the winch properly and easily this kit is a necessity. You can use the winch without but why would you? Excellent price and works great.
1,This is a light duty ATV accessory kit,"I have a lot of WARN stuff, but I do not have an ATV winch. This product is listed as a ""winching accessory kit"" I bought it to use with my Jeep. what I got was an ""ATV winching accessory kit"" I returned the light duty product. Amazon was great on the return, but we wasted shipping money, due to the unclear product description."
2,Poor,"1. Lightweight2. Good for small apartments only.3. Very medicore suction.4. Attached hose is short..cannot really get at corners and baseboards easily.5. The machine filter/cup clogs and fills quickly. If you pick up fine dust, from say carpet freshner, this will lead to a lot of the dust being blown all over your furniture.My unit arrived with a greasy cup that took me a long time to clean out."
1,Eureka 410,"I liked this vacuum at first until the front blew out and I had to replace it under warrenty which was fine. The first one came with a foam filter and it was easy to clean, but the replacement came with a hepa filter which I found totally annoying. It was pleated and a terrible thing to try to clean. I also found that the replacement filter was twice as expensive as the foam and seems to only be available by mail. The company should have left well enough alone. I also have a problem with the handle being loose. I loved the light weight easy push, but I just can't stand that crazy filter......"
4,"Small, but packs a big punch.","Looking at the picture, you would think this vacuum was full sized. To my suprise, the vacuum is quite small. The size made me second guess my choice, but when I turned it on, I was extremely amazed. It worked just as well as a full size. The only drawback is that the cup for collecting dirt is not as large as a full size vacuum. I would recomend this for anyone with a small house or apartment."
5,A Must for Students of Japanese,"My daughter borrowed this from her Japanese teacher over Christmas break and we are now going to buy it for her and an extra copy for her teacher so he can lend more out. As the reviewer below me stated, the characters build on each other and you can learn them.As an artist, I find the explanation on how to write the letters very helpful. There is nothing easy about learning Kanji, but this book shows you how to break it down and learn it."
2,Don't BUY!!,"Don't get this book, I bought it and regret it.The Kodansha Kanji Learners Dictionary (Japanese for Busy People)is a much better book that goes a lot more into detail. Don't waste your money. Just take a look inside both and you'll see."
4,very happy,"I am very happy with this book, but I'm not trying to learn Japanese. I'm an elementary school art teacher and it seems every year I spend hours on line trying to look for English words translated into Japanese symbols that the kids can use in projects. While this book wasn't quite as easy to use as I had hoped, I think that was more because I had underestimated the complexity of the language. I must admit I've never looked at another translation book... but this one seems like a fantastic choice!"
3,read the other reviews for content analysis,"The ""see inside"" option for this book is useless, as it does not actually show you how the book teaches you kanji, instead offering only the indices. If you really want to know what the book is like, find it in a library or bookstore and flip through it first - it might not be for you."
2,Not a good replacement for standard metal faucet knobs,"I purchased this kit looking forward to renewing the look of our older shower fixtures. First of all the nut above the compression washer was too loose and had to be tightened significantly to stop the faucets from leaking from the stem. And second, the design of the cross arm handles don't completely cover the white plastic threaded tube between the handle and the flange, which looks quite ugly. It's very disappointing because this product is sold primarily as a replacement for the older style handles (Danco Perfect Match 88444 Replacement Handles For Price Pfister) which cover the gap between the handle and the flange. I would only purchase this kit if you already have the cross-arm handles insalled in your shower. I'm hoping that they sell a shorter cartridge or longer flanges."
3,it worked but with difficulty,"Stems were a full inch too long. Luckily, it was not the stems I bought this item for, but the handles. We were able to reuse old stems and attach new handles to them."
3,"Price ok, quality poor","What I do like:The price for this kit is good for what you get with it. The valves and stems themselves are quite good and a lot more economical than if one were to try to buy the stems separately at a big box home improvement store.What I don't like:I bought two sets of this kit and the handles on all of them had quite a few chips in the porcelain. The metal is thin and the inside surface not protected well; I removed the handles and sleeves after a week to inspect them, and could already see corrosion setting in on the inside.I'd estimate they last a couple of years before corrosion becomes noticeable. Which is fine for me, as they are going in an apartment that I plan to leave in a couple years."
1,cheap parts,"I got these and the faucet handles were missing white paint in spots (looked like they were porcelain in the photo but they're just painted, and not very well) and the metal parts felt really cheap (super thin metal that seemed like it would corrode instantly upon touching water). I didn't actually install them though so I don't know how they work. They just did not seem very sturdy at all."
1,wrongly titled item,"The previous reviewer was quite right - it's a Slovak Bible, not a Slavonic Bible. I've sent my copy back. Please change the listing name for this item. I've given it one star for the simple reason that it's not what is advertised."
1,Another Bootleg!,"If you purchase this item, you will probably end up returning it. It is a bootleg. You will be able to tell when you see the DVD-Rs inside it and the phony copyright on the back of the package. Don't forget to look at the strange DVD logo on the front of the package. It's actually a backwards D with VD afterwards. Don't you think they would have put DVD on there if the discs were actually DVDs and not DVD-Rs or DVD-RWs?Remember that anyone can make bootleg DVD-Rs. Don't be suprised to see the Spike TV logo in the lower righthand portion of your TV screen or any pauses where commercials were taken out.I purchased volumes 1 and 2 several months ago and ended up sending them back. Trust me on this one."
3,First steps,"This book was helpful in giving me a taste of ballet before making a big commitment to classes, etc. It is helpful for someone just starting ballet, with steps they can practice at home."
4,Hair oil,"Well, I was one of those who unfortunately couldn't stand the smell. So, I mixed a little bit of this oil with another ""nice smelling"" coconut hair oil, LOL, and was able to use it.My hair is super short, I color it often, so I couldn't really tell you what it does, but my hair felt silky, and I actually use it to style my hair.So, thumbs up!"
1,DO NOT BUY THIS ADAPTER!,"If you have a XP machine with SP2 do not buy this adapter. It's such a pain in the next to install, and whats even worse is that belkin doesn't provide support. I had to download RAlink drivers, install it, uninstall it, copy the files to another directory, modify the .inf file for the card, and reinstall it... If you have no idea what i'm talking about.. stay away from it.. i just threw my out and bought a Linksys adapter (owned by Cisco) which worked awesome."
3,"Not as easy as it should be, but it can work","I also had difficulties with the install. The Belkin website now lists a version 3 of the driver that finally worked for me, even though the device wasn't marked as version 3. If it still doesn't work, clear your registry of anything related to Belkin and try again.It does reinstall the driver if you plug it in a different USB port, but it's mainly just a matter of hitting OK a few times, after you have the correct working driver.The included USB extension cable makes it easy to place where you get an optimum signal."
1,Consitent Dropping,"I see from some of the other reviews that I'm not the only one having problems with this adapter dropping the connection. Using it on a Dell laptop and started out ok. I tried updating the driver which turned out to be a big mistake. Hasn't worked correctly since then, even after uninstalling the ""new"" driver and re-installing the old. Now the connection drops if I leave it idle for more than a few minutes.The only caveat is that I am also having problems with the laptop, although I don't know if it is becasue of the Belkin software or some other cause."
1,terrible belkin,"I bought this adapter from the local BestBuy store and found that it was malfunctioning. There as no power light coming on the adapter. After 3 hrs and 4 phone calls to the Belkin Customer Service I found this out. Then I went to the store and got a new one. This had the light but the drivers provided for install were not right.The Belkin technical support is nothing sort of ""cheats"" and ""idiots"". Request to be transferred to the level 2 support and they will cut you off. I wasted like 2 days and 8 phone calls and ulktimately am back to square one trying to get a new adapter. Never buy Belkin again."
1,Mediocre at bes,I have had this Belkin USB Wireless connector for about a year. I have very mixed results. When at my ranch where there are no other wireless internet devices around it works just fine. But when in a big city (like Dallas) and trying to use it at a friend's home where they have a Linksys wireless router it is a hit-and-miss proposition. I am only 20 feet from the Linksys and about half the time I have to Repair the connection to get it to work. Others say they have the same problem. I went for cheap and I got what I paid for. I am going to go to CompUSA or some place and get a better branded product.
1,An exercise in futility,"Go ahead and buy one of these. Then, you can sit there and try to connect to the wireless router for about three hours. Then, once it finally connects, you have approximately five minutes to get yourself online to write a bad review for it before it conks out on you. I have to constantly disconnect it from the computer and then reconnect it, disable and re-enable it with Device Manager, and a whole slew of other things just to get it to work for a few minutes. In addition, you will sometimes have to reinstall the drivers even if you replug it in to the exact same USB port. I've never had this problem with other wireless adapters. In short, avoid this adapter."
4,"This DOES work on Macs and PCs!! Even the latest, version 4000.","I ordered this item on Amazon thinking there were solutions out there for mac os x since this uses Ralink chips -- one of the Ralink drivers would work. No! Ralkin drivers work for versions 1000, 2000, 3000, but not this latest version 4000! That is because apparently Belkin switched chip manufacturers! The new chip is the ZyDAS zd1211. You can get a driver on the Zydas website for macs and PCs. THAT is what you need to get this to work, just follow the instructions here: http://www.netstumbler.org/showthread.php?p=154976 . It DOES work, keep trying! That said, it's not necessarily straightforward, so if you don't like the ~10 min of tinkering or don't feel that you are capable of it, there are other solutions out there for you."
3,Good product -- but worth the price?,"I have five children enrolled in cyber school, so this fall I had to hook up five more PCs to our wireless LAN.I purchased two of the Belkin USB adapters at $33 each, and three Zonet ZEW2501 USB adapters at $9 each. I figured I'd use the more expensive Belkin adapters in rooms farther from the router, and the cheap Zonet adapters in rooms closer to the router.After some tests, I discovered that both brands of adapters worked equally well. Frankly, I wish I had just bought 5 of the cheap Zonet adapters!I must point out that the Belkin adapters come with a nice extension cable and a fancier case than the Zonet. (The Belkin has a nice click-on cap to protect the USB connector if you're carrying it with you on a trip). But considering that I have found no difference in performance, I'd pick the slightly uglier Zonet adapter as a better value."
1,Avoid this adapter at all costs,"I have never gotten this thing to work in the years that I've had it. I can only get 11Mbps on it because it claims I don't have USB 2.0 on my motherboard. Every time I upgrade my machine I give it another try just for kicks and this will be the third 2.0 enabled motherboard it claims doesn't have 2.0. Also the connectivity isn't great because it will drop FREQUENTLY. Another issue I had was with it not recognizing my machine every time I restarted it or took the thing out of the USB port, I had to reinstall every time."
1,Don't waste your money,I have 2 of them Thar JUNKI got 2 of them at the same time A 57 and a 300 thay both drop the signal and I have to reconnect all the time. The 300 stop't working after 3 months I am only about 20 feetFrom my router
3,Maybe,"I purchased this item to replace an identical one that I lost. It installed with no problem, but the signal it provides varies in strength, and almost always is not strong enough to be useful. Still haven't figured out whether it's the device or my computer that is the problem. The first one worked fine. This one would not work at all with the software installed with the first one; on running the ""new"" CD, it told me it was replacing a later version of the software."
1,does not work!!!,Don't waste your time with this item. Its a huge sign when there are more negative than positive ratings. I had to return mine and get something else wasting a several days. Bad Belkin!
3,it works,"I bought this to replace an older one which broke. This one seems to work fine. The price was very fair, far below the in-store price for the same product."
2,Mostly Problems,I've tried using this on XP and on vista. On XP it installs very oddly and I had tons of problems with it cutting out for no reason. I tried reinstalling several times but it never got any better. Now on vista I can't get it to work at all even when trying the new drivers. I'd go with a different adapter if I were you.
1,A dud for me,"Installed into 2.4gHz Pentium 4 machine, Win98. Does not connect to my Linksys wireless router. Router is only 6 feet away from USB dongle. The SSID was correctly read, but apparently the WEP 128 is fouled. Many other machines correctly do connect to the router. Returning this dud product."
1,Blue screen of death,"I use Vista Home Ultimate. When I use this adapter, I randomly get a Blue Screen of Death and have to hard reboot my computer. This occurs from any USB port. Unfortunately, I didn't realize what was causing the crashes until after I'd thrown out the box/receipt, or this would have been returned to the store. I figured out what was causing the problem after I stopped using the adapter (for another reason) and then used it again a couple of months later. Within 3 hours, I'd had two crashes. It's pretty tough to get a blue screen of death on Vista, but somehow this thing manages it. It's now in the bottom of my 'useless cables and crud' box.As far as performance goes, I play online games, primarily World of Warcraft. This adapter doesn't cut it for online gaming. For basic web surfing and maybe even streaming music, it's ok. But I would get lag while playing, especially in heavy traffic areas and that's not acceptable for me! (That's why I stopped using it for a while)."
1,Belkin lies about compatability,"I have a Mac G4, and the Belkin website says that this will work to connect it to a wireless network. What they fail to mention is that only a previous version of the adapter will work on a Mac, because they don't write their own drivers. The tech support for this was rude and not very helpful. I returned the product, and I am preferring copying files to a thumb drive, and physically transferring it to a computer with internet, to dealing with Belkin again."
1,Nothing but trouble,"I can't take it any more, this POS is going back to Amazon tomorrow morning.Randomly disconnects, and it's a crapshoot when (or if) it will reconnect without a reboot.Save yourself a headache and buy something else."
2,"Worked for 7 months, then died -- driver software is subpar","Didn't install properly on WinXP SP2 initially, so had to mess around a lot to get it working. Then after about 7 months of mostly trouble-free use, it just died for no reason.The adapter itself is fine because it works on other machines, but the driver and support software that comes bundled with it are very poor, and I was not able to get it working again even after reinstalling Windows XP!Driver support from Belkin is very poor. Take your business elsewhere."
3,You get what you pay for.,This is an ok product. It does what it needs to do most of the time. sometimes I have to disconnect it and plug it back in for it to work. Also it isnt very good with pickin up the signal. I have to rearrange my room sometimes if my roommate moves her computer cause the signal will be lost if it is moved even a foot away. The first one i had broke the second day so i got another one in place. i havent had a problem with it too much lately. It is an alright product for the money.
1,No longer works with Macs,"Newest version is 4000, and I tried today, 2/26/07 with latest Ralink drivers on a mac powerbook with no luck - device was not recognized. Am looking for another usb adapter that uses the Ralink 2500 chipset."
1,Not the best choice,"BELKIN F5D7050 Wireless 802.11g USB Network Adapter has some deficiencies. The worse one is that it only works on the USB port you first configure the devise, It won work on another port. It also seem to be incompatible with the Linksys WRT54G Wireless-G Router I have. I Do not recommend to use it with a Linksys router, it did not worked for me."
1,Inept.,"Software installs but then device refuses to start (code 10 error), Windows XP and latest drivers.They don't care, why should you."
1,Doesn't work with Tivo,My husband bought this item to work with our Tivo and it doesn't work with it.
4,Mine has been just fine ...,"I've had mine for about 6 months now and am very pleased so far. There are Pro's and Con's, but for the price and the ease of use I'd buy it again, most likely.I've got a Belkin Wireless Router, a Sony Laptop running XP Home and this card plugged into my USB port. That's it, I set her up in a few minutes and POOF I had a wireless network.Granted, I've got to nudge her to wake her up every once and a while, but for the most part it's no big deal at all. This thing is 2 rooms (40-50 ft.) away from the router, too (I guess 3 or 4 walls in between them).So it works fine for me."
5,ubuntu linux,I plugged the devise into the computer and it worked the first time. It opwrks with my wifi just fine.
1,Worst software install ever,"I tried to install this on two windows XP boxes and have to say its the worst driver install experience I've ever had on windows XP, made me feel like we were in 1995 running on a brand new win95 box when drivers didn't really work all that well.After the install the driver wasn't even installed. I manually installed the driver and the software would start but none of the buttons were ever active, I couldn't change settings or anything, it just didn't work at all.It never found my router, I have two of them running, a Linksys and a DLink, another DLink USB wireless adapter works fine and my laptops both work fine using their built in wireless cards."
1,Died in a couple of weeks,"I got this adapter and right off the bat it barely worked. I was a mere 10-15 feet from the wireless router (a Netgear model) and this adapter would only sometimes detect a signal. I had to frequently detach and reattach the adapter to get it to reset and detect the router. (There was a floor between me and the router, and no convenient way to run an Ethernet cable, hence the wireless attempt.)The included wireless network management utility is a joke. Unintuitive and ugly, too-small interface. Luckily you can turn it off and use the Windows zero-configuration utility instead.After a few weeks of this extremely sad performance, the adapter stopped working entirely. Just a dead fob on the end of the USB cable.I got a similar adapter made by D-Link and it's worked flawlessly under identical circumstances.I recommend NOT buying this adapter. It's not worth ANY price when it just doesn't work."
1,Identical but different,"Bought this adapter to work with a laptop that I successfully connected to a home network using an identical adapter we have on another home computer. Deliberately bought exact same version of product & software, which is why I bought through Amazon, but when received, it didn't work. Cost of returning it is prohibitive, so it's so much techno-junk now -- maybe e-bay fodder."
1,never order this product and never buy from Belkin,I ordered this from the Amazon. They sent me a fault device. It wasted me one week's time already and still not able to get it exchanged and returned. Their technical support guys and customer service guys are absolutely hopeless and only try to play around with you. Learn from my experience and never buy their products.
1,staying with Linksys,"I've learned my lesson. I'm finished with Belkin and going to stay with Linksys. As I write this review, I am STILL waiting for Belkin's ""technical"" support to explain to me how to remove their software from my XP machine. After switching from a Linksys wireless G USB adapter to this Belkin adapter and getting weak signal strength and slow connection, I switched back. But, the Belkin software REFUSES to be deleted. The first email to Belkin's ""technical"" support was poorly read, I suppose, since the ""fix"" was for me to use the XP Add/Remove feature. Really! My email listed that effort as my FIRST try. So, far, no response to the second email REPEATING that bit of information. And,the telephone support .... fuhgetaboutit!"
3,ok for the money,"Easy to use and install but it drops the internet constantly at our house. The router is really closeby, and yet it still drops. Works fine for $10, but I would spend another $10 to get a little better usage."
2,Quit after one year,"After about a year of use (with very spotty internet), the computer and the adapter were no longer communicating. Wish I had read the poor reviews that have been posted here before buying."
2,Did not last,"This device worked good at first...got 3-4 ""bars"" reception. After a few months, my internet connection would drop every 5 minutes or so because the reception drops to 1-2 ""bars"". I think the unit gets hot over time, effecting it's functionality and reliablity. I later just ditched the thing and used a hard-wired connection."
1,Software does not work,Do not buy this item - The software does not work and tech support will blame your router or somthing else just to get you off the phone. The lifetime warranty is worthless too.
1,Complete Junk!,"The software installs easily and the supplied utility is decent, but the unit has poor sensitivity compared to my wireless PC Card and most annoyingly it constantly disconnects and reconnects, sometimes several times a minute, even when the signal is fairly strong."
2,Grumpy user,Installed OK on XP but the signal to noise ratio is not good resulting in slow connections and drop outs. Had no trouble real trouble connecting to my WRT54GL rinning DD-WRT other than signal. Other g devices give much better SNRs. The software is also a bit flakey. Next time I will buy Linksys. I was in hurry as my NIC died on my PC so bought the first think I found in WalMart. This will be consigned to the junk box :-(
4,"It works fine for me, mostly","I have had this adapter for a little over a month, and it has been working fine for me most of the time. I keep it one floor below and two rooms away from the router and it usually gets two or three bars of reception out of the five possible (meaning 24-36Mbps reception, on average). On occasion, it will be unresponsive, but the problem always seems to resolve itself within a few hours (I think the key to preventing this may be keeping it cool).Setup was easy: I just put the setup CD in the tray, clicked a few buttons to install, and plugged in the adapter. Enter the hex key, and voila! Internet. Overall, a good value."
1,Do NOT buy this,It will waste hours of your time and deliver disappointing results especially with Windows XP
4,Works fine,"I bought two, one for my PC laptop and one for my MAC desktop. I had done some research and understood this item could be configured to work with my older MAC desktop. So far, I have not been able to get it to work on the MAC. On the PC laptop, it was an easy setup and works great. Slight issue is how long the adapter is and it sticks out the side or back of the laptop about 4-5 inches. It's prone to getting bent a little, but so far the plastic cover has been flexible........but I'm still afraid of breaking it."
1,Not good for Vista,"I got this over the weekend and spent a few hours trying to get it up and running on my Windows Vista desktop. I even went to the Belkin web site and tried using the latest version of the software. At the end, I solved a few issues but had two problems that will force this to be returned:1) The driver was installed and the radio even recognized a few AP's in the neighborhood. But it would not recognize mine that has a hidden SSID, even with the option to do so.2) The software application (icon on task bar, Belkin software in Program Files) just would not install on Vista. I tried many different things, but the installer would install the driver and then stop.I just picked up a PCI card that I'll use. One final item: The USB connecter was super hot after about 15 minutes of use. I would be scared to keep this on 24/7."
2,"Works, but requires power","This adapter works fine in my Vista PC, but it was a problem to install. The directions packaged with it are wrong for Vista, but you only find this out by scouring the information on Belkin's web site (and it isn't easy to find there). The real problem with it is that it seems to require more power than some USB ports provide. For example, on my PC, a usb port in which a flash drive works just fine can't even see the Belkin adapter. You need either a powered hub or a port that has plenty of juice flowing through it. As many, many posts on the web note, the Belkin tech support is worse than useless. I haven't even heard back from them on my report. All that said, the product does work; I've had no drops or other problems. In fact, I do run an older Belkin wireless adapter on a second PC (under XP), and the older one sometimes has a problem connecting to the router, whereas the new one under Vista seems to connect without a hitch."
2,"Constanly looses connection, the adapter's fault","This thing constantly loses connection. It's not my access point's fault, other devices such as other usb cards, PCI desktop cards, and the Apple iPhone connect without hassle to my router. This thing is just a bad product, plain and simple. It overheats like crazy too. I've never been able to reach a speed of over 13mbps with this thing. Just buy another USB card and save yourself the trouble."
2,Rotten,"I've had this for a couple of years and it's always had something or another wrong with it. I had always thought it was my setup but the other reviews confirm my suspicions. The software packaged with it is unpredictable and highly unresponsive. After losing our router's signal for the umpteenth time, I'm buying another one and throwing this thing in the trash."
3,OK adapter for 32-bit OSs,"Belkin doesn't develop 64-bit drivers for this adapter and the newer F5D8055, stay away from Belkin if planning on using these wireless adapters in a 64-bit Win OSsBut on the plus side, works great on Hackingtosh."
5,quick and easy to install,"This wireless network adapter by BELKIN was quick and easy to install, came with a CD and was ready in 5 minutes!!"
2,It works intermittenly,"I've had this adapter for about a year now and it's works for about 6 months of that. I've gone through the process of unistalling and reinstalling the drivers from the provided CD a few times on my Win7 box. But, eventually it just stops connecting. My WiFi router is about 20 meters a way. I don't think its operator error. As a workaround, and eventually just left it, I flashed dd-wrt onto a spare Linksys WiFi router and used it as a wireless bridge to my providers WiFi router and just used the ethernet adapter on the desktop that i was trying to use the Belkin wireless adapter on. So, I think I should be able to figure out how to load drivers from a CD. In fact, I'm using the bootleg Wireless bridge right now to leave this review."
1,I GOT BEAT - NONE OF THE USB ADAPERS WORKS,I BROUGHT TWO BELKIN F5D7050 AND THEY BOTH DO NOT WORK. PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM. I WILL ONLY BUY THIS ITEM DIRECTLY FROM DELL.
1,not worth it,Have not had it more then a month and it already malfunctioned.I was doing a mid term for school when all a sudden it stopped workingtried fixing the problem and it said the device was malfunctioned.Itherefore tried it in another lap top of mine and same problem there forethere fore this is a bad buy.
4,Worked well,Easy to set up. Was pleased with fast shipping and value of product. Belkin makes great products. Would reccommend to anyone who needs this product.
1,Extremely poor quality,"This card, when it worked at all, was a hit-or-miss proposition. Many times, I would have to repair the connection, switch preamble modes, or restart the computer to get it to see either the Belkin wireless router or the Linksys wireless router. This was even when the router was no more than 20' away.Second, it was impossible to get the card to work with my Toshiba laptop. After downloading three versions of the driver (there are 4), one finally worked, but was unable to pick up the school network, which is nice & strong.If the card is removed from, or falls out of, its USB slot, it is not uncommon for Windows to ""forget about"" the card, and ask you to reinstall the driver upon putting it back in.I finally smashed the card against the wall. It works as well now as it did then. If I could give this thing zero stars, I would."
1,"Honestly, this adaptor is bad.... REAL BAD.","Installed drivers, plugged it in, nothing. Uninstalled, rebooted, installed drivers, NOTHING. Googled it and found tons of stories you have read here.I like what a couple other people have said.""Buy this for someone you hate."" It's terrible...I've had other Belkin products in the past and I'm surprised at how bad this thing is.The few people on here that gave it 4-5 stars will probably win the lottery next week because they are the luckiest people I know."
1,Only for non XP machines,"Just a few words to say how disappointed I am at the performance, or lack of, on an XP machine.The F5D7050 works fine on the Win2k OS but AVOID if you are using XP.The drivers install on XP but give a variety of error codes, depending upon which version you are using and the BELKIN Tech Support have been totally ignorant to any emails.I eventually bought a Linksys WUSB54G which was very simple to setup and worked immediately.Hope this review helps."
3,meh...,"It worked for about a year, then started falling apart. It's construction is weak and fragile. If you don't mind replacing it every year, go for it."
2,Poor reception,"This adapter can't seem to give the same data rate as my laptop when they are side by side. It slows to a crawl at times (5mbps) when the laptop is connecting at 54mbps. Sometimes it connects okay, but it's poor frequently enough that I regret the purchase. I would recommend you look to another product to meet your wireless needs.Also, I had to set it up to use the windows wireless management so it would be recognized any time I reboot. The Belkin tool wasn't letting it connect automatically and I had to reenter the WEP key each time."
4,Surprisingly Good!,"This was my 3rd Wireless Adapter and why I keep getting them I don't know but out of them all I would say this one was the best! It worked right along with my router and my network as well as my school's network. To me the software was kinda useless that why I always used windows instead but it didn't hurt it at all. However, you do have to keep in mind that is a external network adapter made out of plastic so I had to be careful how I handled it. That would be my only complaint but nevertheless it still worked fine."
1,Impossible to find driver for windows 7 or 8.,When I got this adapter it took me 3 hours to track down a driver that wouldn't just stop working in windows 7 from Atheros. The Belkin drivers just don't work. I used it for about it year and it would cause panics/stop errors all the time.Recently I checked the Belkin website and found a driver update for window 7 and guess what it doesn't work. I just chucked it in the trash at that point I wasn't going to deal with it any longer.Do not buy this.
1,BELKIN F5D7050 Wireless USB Adapter,"I bought this product due to the fact in doing the research and what was stated by the manufactor that it would work with Windows 98 Operating System, well don't waste your money, it will not work. After talikg to Teck. Support the told me that an error had been made in details, no it will not work, gee thanks for telling me after I done bought it. They told me for a mere $39.95 they would get it to work, what a ploy to get more business, big rip off. So in short if you have Windows 98 and need to go wireless in your home forget it, won't work. Belkin informed me they would correct the information provided about this product to Amazon so this don't happen again, will I get a refunded, no, but they would sell me something else that would, what a deal, (not). Buyer beware!"
4,Works great!,This adapter works very well! We really liked the price and it made a great substitute for the network card in an older desktop.
1,Horrible signal,When I purchased this it didn't say anything about the signal strength. Once I received the item I realized that you basically ha to have the computer right next to the router for this to work.
1,Convenient but dissapointing performance,"I was excited because instead of installing a PCI card, I just needed a USB stick. However, it does not work! Right next to it is another dell computer in my office. In the other room two walls away is a Belkin router. The computer with the Belkin PCI card always has a connection. But this computer right next to it with this USB stick will see the router and then constantly lose the connection. Simply does not work well, so even though I am poor I will be looking for a replacement."
1,Don't waste your money,"Worked ok in the same room as my wireless router, but after the router died in a lightning storm I bought a 2nd Belkin USB adapter and put the router in the center of my home. Both Belkins kept showing a strong signal, but kept failing to connect -- just like everyone else here says. They also kept disconnecting and were slow even when connected. I thought it was the new router at first, but after reading other reviews on the Belkin adapter, I realize I've been ripped off TWICE. Belkin is a good company, but makes a lousy wireless USB adapter. I was a UNIX and Windows systems administrator for 11 years, so I'm quite capable setting up a network. Funny, my Dell laptop with built-in wireless is RIGHT NEXT TO my Sony Vaio computer with the Belkin. I'm using the Dell to write this ONLINE, but the Vaio with the Belkin adapter is not connecting to the router. Buy a Linksys!"
2,Does not work with Vista 64-bit.,Inside the box is a hastily added note that this device does not work with some Vista systems. It would not work on my 64-bit system. There is a Vista 32-bit driver on Belkins web page; can't say if it works or not.
1,The software come wtih the device is really bad,"Thd software come with this device sucks! I installed/uninstalled it three times, I even go to their website to download the driver cause i doubted the CD come with my adapter was bad. but the driver i downloaded from their website was as bad as the CD one. You even can not see some menus correctly. They displayed as wierd characters. Since I bought it very cheap after rebate, dont want to return it."
2,belkin doesn't provide firmware updates for this,"I don't understand why belkins doesn't provide any firmware upgrade on this device. The device has 0.5 version of firmware shipped. Usually developers would name their release 0.5 when they are not sure if that software works yet. They have shipped it and there are no firmware upgrades. Reasons for wanting to upgrade firmware i get intermittent failures on this whereas my IBM thinkpad that has built in devices continues to stay on the very same network in the very same room. Must be belkins device fault.I got this for like 15 bucks after rebate, so I am keeping it.But best names in consumer network are really SMC and Cisco (linksys) and perhaps D-link as well."
1,Rubbish,"This device has wasted hours of my time because of its useless and completely un-intuitive software and interface. This offers, to beginners at least, a completely mystifying series of menus and titles that tell you nothing about how the device works or how to get it going. It looks cheap when you buy it but the real cost comes later - when it sucks away the hours of your day without working and without giving any clue as to why it isn't working. Buy it for those you hate."
1,Horrible Connection,My internet connection flickers between on and off. I'm connected to the internet for about 3 seconds then the wireless adapter drops it. Very frustrating.
1,"Do yourself a favor, go with Linksys","Terrible terrible terrible.Very easy to install. That is when the trouble starts. After I restarted my computer, network settings were erased. Tech support doesnt speak english, and doesnt help.The very low price lures you in, but after fooling with the thing for hours you will realize you should have just gone with Linksys to begin with. Save yourself the trouble."
2,afraid,"this is a replacement for the first one and i am afraid to even try to use it. i got it for my mother and when the first one didnt work i went to walmart and bought one. i paid a lot more for it but it works and i had the option to buy the insurance policy for it for, so i did."
1,No Mac Drivers,I bought this device to give wireless ability to a Mac G4 computer.It came with no Mac drivers and the web site where I was supposed to be able to get a Mac driver is no longer open.So it is just another piece of worthless junk too me.
2,did not like. no range,The device did not have enough range to be of any use to me. I tried to use on an upstairs computer and the signal was too weak to reach.
3,good usb wifi adapter,"pro's: easy to use, picks up signals well, can be used as a semi-directional antenna.con's: needs an extension cable and some sort of ""dock"" or base to hold it, one with a swivel mount would be great."
1,did not work,Tried to connect to wifi (not a computer guru) called for tech support and they wanted to charge me for support never again
2,it's ok,"I've had mine for about 8 months. It works ok but nothing spectacular. It gets kinda hot sometimes, if you leave your computer on all the time. It also seems to just drop connection from time to time, which is a real pain. Sometimes I have to take it out to get it to reset. I'm looking to replace it because it drops connection about every 10 minutes now, which isn't cool at all. I wouldn't buy another one to replace it."
2,No WEP,"I bought one of these so I could move the old computer up to my son's room. It's running Windows Me, but so what? Belkin says that's supported.I can get it to work when broadcasting my SSID, I can get it to work when not broadcasting my SSID. What I can't get it to do is work with WEP, either 64 or 128 bit. Called up support, they said ""Me has no diagnostics. You can return it to the store."""
2,Inconsistent,"Frequently disconnects for no apparent reason, even with a Belkin router. You then have to ""repair"" the connection to get it working again. The strength isn't that great either - usually ""poor"" to ""good"" from one room and 20 ft away.I wouldn't bother with this kit - there's nothing worse than an weedy, intermittent 'Net connection."
3,Works fine but few problems,"It will drop connections once in a while, can't complain yet.Big problem:The c:\program files\belkin folder opens upeverytime at pc startups ! It is not in the startup folder,it is hidded inside perhaps as a service.Waiting for their email reply to myhow to remove it question.jim"
1,Do not buy.,"When I brought it back to Walmart, the customer service person exclaimed ""Not another one of these!""Yes it's a lemon. It worked some times, but never very well.Good idea - bad product. I'm going to try the Linksys version.UPDATE: I got a linksys. It works great."
5,Lovely story,I just absolutely love this book. Our baby is only 8 month old so she doesn't appreciate this yet but my husband loves reading this to her and giving her the many kisses as he goes through the story. It really is a very sweet and lovely bedtime reading.
1,Un happy,"I down-loaded turbotax and I can't use it, help, it won't open. contact me @ my e-mail addr."
1,A really pathetic product,"Ive used Kiplinger's program for three years now on three different machines with no problems and consistently good results. Today, I purchased Turbo Tax 2001 by mistake (really, I didnt look closely and just tossed it into my cart).After completely finishing my taxes (two hours) I saved to a diskette and decided to print at a later date. When I went to open my saved tax return.....nothing. The diskette is fine, everything else on it is fine, but my tax return is COMPLETELY GONE! Nice job Intuit. Im out [the money], a trip to the store (again) and two awful hours of filing my tax return.Is this, easy, fast, or powerful tax help? I certainly think not. Never again will I buy an Intuit product."
1,Rats!,"I've used Turbo Tax for 7 years, but 2001 was probably the last.I'd carefully kept Internet Explorer off my computer - no easy feat! Then, I install TurboTax 2001 and it installs IE! No asking if I wanted it, no ""cancel"" button, just a program I didn't want. (Which incidentally [fouled] up my internet connection.)But that's not all. While running, Turbo Tax splashes advertisements for all kinds of garbage on the screen. I don't know about you, but I find doing taxes unpleasant enough without having to plow through supurflous adverts.Maybe they should charge a little more up front and quit the bogus hucksterism."
3,"Good, but not our favorite black and white book","This is one of several black and white books that we got before our first baby was born. He definitely did like the black and white books more than other books for the first several months, and this one was fine. However, I usually chose other books because I wasn't totally sure what one of the pictures in this book was supposed to be (Ritz crackers? Flowers without stems???) Also, the pictures are all completely unrelated to each other, so it may be hard to find things to say to your baby about them if you're not someone who can easily make conversation about anything! If I could only get one black and white book, I'd definitely go withLook, Look!by Peter Linenthal, as the baby was most fascinated by the pictures in that one, and it had a simple text (this book has no words) that helped me come up with stuff to say about each page."
4,My daughter loves it!,I usually will put this book in the corner of her play yard and more often than not she ends up staring at the pictures. She also likes to chew on the corners!
1,don't waste your money,this book is so simple that my infant has even lost interest in its pictures.
3,"OK, great as a first book.","My eight month old got bored with this pretty quickly. It has very few pages, at first he was excited about recognizing the images, but there aren't enough of them to keep him interested for long. It is a good choice for a first book, to get little ones interested."
1,Not worth it,"This book is a cute idea, but the objects that were chosen to use as illustrations were not common and somewhat weird. You would think they would do recognizable things like elephants, bear, etc. No this book used reading glasses, a weird clown and a ritz cracker!!!! Please do not buy!!!"
4,good for a small baby,"My son outgrew this pretty quickly, considering I ordered it when he was already a few months old. But he did like the big pictures. There are only 5-6 pages and each has one large black image on it, it wasn't what I expected."
2,OK. Dr Seuss works better,"While they are great in principle and the babies to start to look at them early, they grow out of this book really fast. Also at the age where this is better the babies cannot focus on one thing easily and these are hard to prop up for the baby to focus on.I find the Dr. Seuss collection far better. You can read them out to the baby and they'll respond to your voice and face. You can also leave them open and their is a lot of contrast their. Not as much as this but they'll last much longer and are far more interesting.These are a waist"
5,Cute for little ones,This book is cute for the younger ones 0-6 months. You can illustrate it the way you want and that will help for a better connection with your little one.
2,disappointed,Rather disappointed in this book. The pictures are not really items that are relevant to a baby's life. I prefer other black and white books that we'd purchased.
5,Great Product Great Price JVC Ear Buds,I recently had the unplanned opportunity this Christmas to compare the JVC Gummy earbud headphones against the Sony version and the Memorex version of this product. So the scientist in me and my 2 daughters tried all three on an ipod nano. It was amazing the difference between the products. The bass is considerably clearer on the JVC product. The volume is much louder ( so you don't have to raise the volume as high and subsequently also raising the hiss and other noise of the particular player you're using). The vocals and cymbals were equally crisp. All this for a mere $8.99 plus S&H online or $14.99 in Walmart. The only drawback that we could find is that the earbuds are inherently uncomfortable for some of us after about an hour as compared to the in-the-ear type. Overall a thumbs up for the JVC Gumy Earbud headphones. Cheers...Les
4,Pretty Good,"Nothing special I mean, Knut Schreiner could very well be my favorite guitarist of all time, but like the other Euroboys albums, this one comes off as too derivative, and a good listen if your super high or in the right mood, but otherwise you won't be listening to it too much. Musically impressive, but nothing insane."
5,Hope this one lasts!,"This 12 inch skillet is a dream of nonstick. It is weighted well. The copper core imparts wonderful heat without a high flame and cooks beautifully. If this frypan continues to perform this well, I expect to order another and perhaps some gifts for others down the road. We shall see!"
3,Interesting History,"This book is an interesting history of the Mass. It is a bit tedious to read, but contains some good information about the development of Mass as we attend it today."
3,"functional, but nothing more...","I waited nearly 10 months before writing this review. I've lived with this product, and use it a great deal with my Macbook Pro. Having said that, it does what it says it will do, but it could be better constructed.The plastic adhesive dots supplied to provide elevation to your laptop will slide and fall out over time, preventing proper ventilation of your laptop.It's not really very comfortable to use while sitting up, but it works well when you're laying down on the couch. If I had to do it again, I'd probably look elsewhere for another similar product."
4,Surprisingly good,"You wouldn't think this lap desk would keep your laptop cool, considering it really isn't vented. The metal seems to stay cooler, which keeps the unit cooler. It is definitely easier on the lap. Very nice!"
2,huh?,"I suppose this does what it claims to, but it's pretty shoddy. It's basically a thin metal plate (with their silly logo cut out of it in the center) and then a flimsy roundish thing attached at the bottom and a really floppy thing on a hinge at the top. I thought that for $55 I would be getting something that seemed worth $55. This seems more like $15. Returning this was a no-brainer."
4,Solid for the price,"Pure Trance is a nice unmixed alternative to the often boring mixed cd's from Oakenfold and Armin van Buuren. Pure trance 4 is also not as cheesy and vocal based as the Trance Party and Ultra Trance series. Stand-out songs are Cosmic Gate's ""Tomorrow"", Kate Ryan's' remixed ""Only If I"", and M.O.P.E.'s ""It's Dawning Upon Me"". Ultimately Pure Trance 4 is a nice low cost alternative to the Dream Dance series, but I prefer the harder side of trance in Tunnel Trance Force, or the partier side in the Future Trance compilations."
4,This stuff is no joke,"So I bought this along with the Dave's Ultimate Insanity, and this stuff takes the cake. Delicious flavor, unbelieveable heat. I put about 10 droplets in a bowl of salsa and should probably have used half that much. I love hot sauce, more than 99% of people, and this sauce blew my top. This is not going to sound like a good review, but believe me it is, its so hot it made me throw up. USE WITH CAUTION because your body will try to reject it. Most delicious poison ive ever tasted! Enjoy!"
4,Wonderful fun!,"I'll admit that the regular Kirby games just didn't catch my interest after I tried them, but the Pinball Land game is actually a lot of fun. Basically, it IS a pinball game, with flippers and everything, but various elements have been added to make the game more interesting. You have a total of three pinball boards (Wispy, Kracko, Poppy) and you work your way through each game - each game has three sections, bottom, middle, and top. If you fall from the top to the middle, no big deal. You only actually lose a life when you fall through the bottom of the bottom. Each section has certain things that will help you make it to the next section of the board, and 'beating' the top section of each board takes you to the boss.Beating all three takes you to King Dedede. All in all, this is actually a pretty fun version of a pinball game, with familiar characters from the regular Kirby games. The challenge level is decent, so this game is definitely not a pushover."
1,Not Fun,This game is so stupid it has no good meaning to it. it is no fun.If you liked this game then check out all of the other Kirby Games.
1,"Spanish version, *not* English","Like a previous reviewer, I was dismayed to receive this book and find that it was in Spanish; the fact that it was the Spanish version was buried in the comments section & the title made no indication it was Spanish. Buyer beware!"
2,Plutarch on Sparta,"For Plutarch diehards. Other than Lycurgus, the few Lives covered are all relatively obscure Spartan kings of the Hellenic period. Half the book is comprised of Spartan ""sayings"" which are very tedious."
1,extended tom and jerry episode,"Basically my title says this. Reading this book was like reading 200 pages of transcript for a Tom and Jerry cartoon. People are maniacally out to get each other, for no good reason. There's no real character development, which makes their actions entirely unbelievable. Reading this book was incredibly frustrating. I actually didn't laugh at all, and I love to read comedies. For every night I was reading this (only to get it done for my bookclub) I dreaded going to bed, because I would have to slog through a few more pages with no purpose."
1,Neighbors you can't believe in,"I'm fairly tolerant with fiction, but Neighbors by Thomas Berger is a waste of time and money; I tried twice to read it, but couldn't. Basically, it's silly, just preposterous. The plot points occur so rapidly and with so little regard to plausibility that it reminded me of an old drawing-room comedy from the 1930's, only condensed and spruced up as a television sit-com. If an author creates neither compelling characters who are believable within his fictional parameters, nor a plot to hold my interest, I put the book down after about 70 pages, which is what happened with Neighbors. Don't bother with it."
4,Well - you've seen the film - why not read the book (thirty years later)?,"I've been meaning to read this book for years and finally got around to it. Like most people I am familiar with the story having seen the movie adaptation - famously John Belushi's final movie.Well - you've seen the film - why not read the book (thirty years later)?Naturally the book is different than the film - for example, in the book, Vic is Harry. There was some discussion when the movie was released that it was an odd choice to cast the two stars the way they did - perhaps the wild, mad Belushi should have been Harry (Vic). But after reading the original I think the casting was the right on.Overall I'd say this book is an example of a story with no likable characters - I found I wasn't really empathetic with any of them - not even Earl; but the bizarre story and outcome has left me thinking about the story a lot - so I'd say the story was quit affecting."
1,Unbelievable.......and not funny,"This book was selected for my book club, and I was looking forward to the read. Initially, I was drawn in to the story and couldn't put it down. After about 75 pages of craziness, I expected some reality to ground the story, and it didn't happen. After 180 pages of non-stop, increasingly unbelievable behavior, and no connection whatsoever with any of the characters, I did what I've never done with a book before - went to the last 5 pages to have it over with already. I don't recommend this book."
1,Don't do what I did,"I bought one of these printers and fresh out of the box it didn't work. They sent me a refurbished printer for a brand new printer. They did see the error of their ways and sent me a new printer which lasted a few months before I had to send that one back. They sent me another printer and that one lasted the longest about 7 months. Overall, in one year I went through 5 of these printers before I said enough and they pro-rated my refund. So if you're a risk taker go ahead and buy it."
4,Needed alot of add-ons to get it to work,As we all know with some older games we have to either downgrade our systems or search for software that will support it. Well fortunantely I was able to find some on a few fan sites and begin playing it. It felt good to play a game from my childhood and still have the same opinion about it even after it being so outdated. If you are looking for a blast from the past that can give you a few hours of entertainments pick this one up!
5,Music that really fits....,"The Trevor Rabin soundtrack to Flyboys is much like the film itself...very under rated. The music perfectly captures WWI France, it's both exciting and melodic...with a hauntingly beautiful Flute playing throughout.All the tracks are very good and do tell a story. They are better if you are familiar with the film yet can also stand, quite admirably, on their own.A very nice edition to my soundtrack library...I predict very good things from Mr. Rabin in the future...his soundtrack here is truly memorable."
4,"INTRIGUING, INTERESTING, ADVENTURE","Recommended for readers who like foreign intrigue and adventure, with New York/Italian and Indonesian reality mixed in. Set in the 1970s in a world unknown to most of us; provides some insight into another culture and non-governmental expats. Captivating and fun."
3,"Ick, what's this crud?","Overall, these aren't horrible, but I wouldn't buy them again. I didn't have any of the problems with sore ears reported here, and the sound quality isn't bad, but after a couple months I noticed a brown ring around the speaker bit. Dirt and earwax had snuck in between the ""gummy"" cover and the speaker. Of course, pulling back the gummy cover just made the gap between it and the speaker bigger, and once the gray bit over the speaker fell off. I guess you get what you paid for."
2,cute but uncomfortable,"the buds don't fit very well and fall out - they caused a continual pain and made the outside of my ears soar from the many attmepts of fitting them inside my ear. Would not recommend, or buy again"
1,Not good for those with small ears,"Yesterday, I bought this item based on the 4 to 5 star reviews here and elsewhere. Unfortunately, this product was a disappointment. It doesn't deliver much bass or treble, and like the other reviewers have said, it's a nice look, but your ears will get sore after they are used for a short period of time.Luckily, I was able to take them back and get a refund. To go with the pink iPod nano, I recently bought a pair of Sony Pink earbuds (10LPPI) and not only are they confortable, they deliver a nice sound for a cheap price. For the time being, I am going back to them and the Philips behind the neck headphones.JVC can do better."
4,New Face for Minimalism,"Without being derivative, this composer manages to create some really attractive music with clearly minimalist roots. These roots seem to include Arvo Part and Philp Glass. But as I said this is not derivative music, it is original and intriguing. There is a sense of the spiritual in these works but this is hardly a new age composer. Kutavicius makes use of unusual instrumental combinations to great effect. This is tonal and beautiful music which is also clearly contemporary. This is a good intro to the little known music of this artist."
2,Disappointing.,"The photography is adequate, but the collection is neither sufficiently artistic and/or very erotic to satisfy fans of photography or fans of homoeroticism."
5,Tidy Little Unit,"I've had this printer for a few months and it has been flawless in operation. The sheets coming out of the printer did tend to fall out like another reviewer said . . .until I figured out that the support for the outbound pages wasn't fully extended. The printer status message does appear on start-up, but it's a very minor irritation. Other than that, it's a gem.I just refilled the toner cartridge with a generic refill for about $20 and it works OK. The internal chip has hit its limit and the printer is now operating at 6 PPM, which is OK for my limited home use. 6000 page aftermarket chips are available now for about $10 to correct this. They are easy to change, so if you're willing to do a little work, toner can be pretty cheap."
3,Solution to paper falling out,"If you're finding that every other page you print is ending up on the floor, here's a simple solution: Turn the stack of paper over in the feed tray, so the bottom-facing sides are now facing up.Most printer/copier paper is manufactured with a different ""finish"" on one side. (Sometimes the packaging for the paper even indicates ""this side up."") If you don't load the paper correctly, then the finish can cause feed/output problems."
1,Lots of Problems - Buy a Different Model,"The printer installed fine under Windows XP, and small text looks OK. But pictures and large text are very ""streaky"". Pages often print a little crooked even though the paper looks aligned OK in the feed chute. When it prints, it almost always feeds in extra sheets no matter what type of paper I use, and this often leads to jams. On documents over 5-6 pages or so, it will dump paper eveywhere because the receive tray is so poorly designed (doesn't matter how I adjust it). Not to mention the toner limit of 1500 pages - and the new toner replacement for 6k pages costs as much as the printer.I made a big mistake buying this printer and will buy a different make once the toner runs out. Konica-Minolta should be ashamed for creating such a low quality printer."
2,Unimpressed,"I purchased this printer through an office supply store, and am quite unimpressed with its output. The printer will suddenly start giving errors such as ""fatal laser unit error"", causing the printer to sieze and need to be restarted, and this was only after 10 months of light usage (a total of 2,700 pages were printed from it.) The toner cartridge and its connection can at times also be a bit faulty in that it uses the toner, despite being on ""save"" mode, like a sieve. Just not a good investment overall."
2,Printer is Fine; Toner Rip Off/Scam,"So I've been using the printer on and off for personal use... I estimate I have printed about 200 pages of items. The last print out was fine... no fainting of ink and etc that would hint that the toner was low, BUT Minolta doesn't care about that. It sets its toners to stop working and gives an error message. First of all, the error message is of no help. You need to research what it means via the website. As for the online status bar, it doesn't tell you anything except there is a communication issue. Argh... what a ripoff...To summarize:Pros: Prints wellCons: Status Page worthless and confusingError message confusingand toner set up is a rip off"
2,Not impressed.,"The printer worked well for a short time. After the toner was empty, I tried using a guaranteed remanufactured toner refill. It didn't work very well, so I tried another guaranteed toner refill (I refused to pay more for a toner cartridge than the printer cost). The second toner smeared everywhere and didn't print. A new Konica-Minolta cartridge didn't fix the problem, and Konica Minolta refused to service the unit even though it was under warranty.Save your money."
1,How NOT to design a printer.,A Cnet reviewer tested this and discovered that its output tray could only handle 10 pages and then the pages went everywhere. I wish I had known that. I would never have bought it. Consider this. It prints 21 pages per minute. So you can only leave the printer for 30 SECONDS before you're in deep do-do. And THAT is when the output tray is still on the printer. Mine broke in the first week and you can't repair it.
3,Loud and laggy budget laser printer,"I own this printer and the Hewitt-Packard Laserjet 1012. I definitely prefer the HP printer to this one. The HP was much smaller and quieter. The HP also had a shorter warm up time and slightly better quality print outs. However, once the 1350W warms up, it really churns out those pages quickly. But if you're only printing a few pages, waiting for the printer to warm up can be a lil annoying. It's only about 20 seconds though.Another note...for black and white printing, a more expensive later printer will be cheaper than an ink jet printers in the long run."
1,The Worse Laser printer,I hate this printer! It tells you the cartridge is low when it isn't and the paper guide never stays on so I have to take a page off one at a time. I can never leave this printer unattended.
1,Worst piece of electronics I ever owned,This piece of junk comes with such crappy drivers that it only works 1/3 of the time. Worse piece of electronics I ever bought. I normally don't write reviews but I just have to find a way to vent.
1,Worthless would be too kind a description!!,"This book doesn't even come up to ""Worthless"" for a description. It has nothing in it that would help a collector to descern one edition of a book from another. It has NOTHING about the series of stories that ERB is most famous for (Tarzan) and what it has on the other series and single story books is empty fluff at best. There are some very nice photos but there is no cohesiveness. No information on first editions, what differentiates a first from a second edition etc. The prices listed are not only unrealistic but grossly unrealistic. Do youeself a favor and DO NOT BUY this book."
1,A crushing disappointment!!!,"If there was a zero rating option, I would have picked it.I LOVED the two predecessors to this novel, Winterlong and Aestival Tide. Elizabeth Hand had drawn us into a dark future frightening and enthralling. Icarus Descending, on the other hand seems to have been written by someone who couldn't care less about the first two books... Everything in the first two books lead to NOTHING. I was so disappointed by this book that I shall never read another by the author again. In fact, I threw away my copy of Icarus Descending and just pretend that it never existed."
2,Not what I thought it would be,"The description and picture on the page did not adequately portray the product. I used it anyway, but not what I wanted."
