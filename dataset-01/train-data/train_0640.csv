4,Powerfull and convincing,"Through the book ""In Search Of.."", you too could experience the God or Goddess with in. Also you will discover you are not alone, and that anything, anything is possible, You may also become aware who you really are.-Michael de Jong Author ""I Thirst"""
3,NOT THE BEST IN THE SERIES,"I gave this one three stars rather than the two I probably should, due simply to the fact that it is a Casca book and is supposedly by Sadler. This is number thirteen in the series and is certainly not up to the good read the first several books were. I rather think I agree with the other reviewer here in that I suspect that this was, at least in part, written by someone other than the author, i.e. Sadler. The story seems rather thrown together and almost follows some sort of formula. Certainly the spirt of Casca was not there. On the other hand, reading it did me no real harm, it was kinda fun, and only took a couple of short sessions. Recommend it simply as it is a part of the series, but don't expect too much out of this one. On the other hand again, it is still far, far better than the recent two attempts by the publisher to bring back Casca."
2,Casca The Assassin is Assassinated,"I was quite disappointed with this story - it had the feel of being rushed through and had far too many convenient meetings and solutions at the end. Some of Sadler's books are good in parts, others good all through. This was assassinated after about one third of the way in! Maybe it was written in one afternoon and there were cakes in the oven... not one of his best but a few good points? Well, the induction into the Assassins was well written and the Arabic characterization was good."
2,The Assassin,"Further to my review below it seems to me that many of Sadler's later books were written by ghost writers as the style widely differed. In this book it first began to be noticeable, and really is a bit too neatly packaged, particularly at the end where everything is neatly and conveniently tidied up. Its a little too unbelievable which spoils the storyline.Otherwise the story is ok, without being anywhere near the classic of early Sadlers in this series.for more Casca see www.casca.net"
5,very good book,"whn a probe is discovered carrying a distress signal that is over 200 years old, the enterprise is ordered to the area to see what finally became of the planet. they are very surprised to find that some of the inhabitants did survive. but as the enterprise makes first contact, they find that their is a lot of dissention and rebellion among the ranks of the people. all of them do not want the enterprise's help and will go to any extreme to keep that from happening.the book dragged some but the story was basically very well written and definitely better than the first book in the series."
2,Grade: Incomplete,"This would be a tolerably well-written book -- nothing spectacular, but not bad -- were it not for the fact that it ends on a cliffhanger. If you do not share my dislike of books which fail to contain an entire storyline within one pair of covers, consider this a three to four star review. But given that we not only don't complete the story here, but we don't even find out who the bad guys are, this is a truly annoyingly incomplete story. I'm not objecting to the fact that the storyline has continued on into this book from the previous one, as that book completed its primary plotline; what carried over into this book are essentially subplots, which is always acceptable. But to leave the primary storyline so completely up in the air is to beg a grade of, at best, ""incomplete""."
3,A decent but slow book,"The authors capture the characters very well. All of the main characters act, speak and behave in the correct way. However the pacing is incrediby slow. The biggest problem I had however is with the main protagonist. Kalsha appears out of nowhere. By the end of the story we still dont know his/her motives or background.3 stars for getting the characters right and having the story feel like star trek. Only three stars due to pacing and reading an entire book and not having a clue what the conflict is. Also there is too much effort to tie enterprise into this. TnG works better without shoehorning enterprise references in."
1,"""We don't guarantee that this remote control works.""","I bought this one as a replacement remote for my Sony television. It worked fine except for the PIP functions. With PIP, I couldn't change channels. I called tech support and they told me that ""We don't guarantee that this remote control works."" I asked for a supervisor who modified that to ""We don't guarantee that this remote control works with your Sony television."" Remarkably, they couldn't tell me what remote control would work with my Sony television."
2,Doesnt work with Dish Network,"I had to call the customer service Rep to program it for my Toshiba TV. It doesnt work with my Samsung TV. Also, its not compatible with Dish Network equipment. I havent tried it yet with my Toshiba DVD player or my Toshiba VCR."
4,Works as expected.,"We have one of these exact same remotes that came with a Sony Receiver that we use in our garage. One night we dropped the remote and it no longer worked.We ordered one of these as a replacement. It arrived quickly and works great for what we need to use it for, for our Sony Receiver. We can power on the receiver, change the preset stations, turn up/down the volume. No complaints here, it works great!I'm not sure about other issues that some reviewers are having, seeing as we aren't using it for that purpose and we never would think about using it for that purpose."
5,GREAT DEAL!! GREAT REMOTE!!!,"I replaced my Motorola cable box remote, RCA TV remote, Phillips Home Theater remote and it even works on the Zenith TV in my master bathroom. Thanks to this, 4 remotes down to 1. Easy to program."
1,the great pretender,"I bought this remote control but It did not worked out with my pioneer DVD player and my cable TV decoder although ""the pretender"" to promise so.If I were sony I'd started to think a little better before to promise something to a customer."
4,A good inexpensive remote control,"For the inexpensive price of [$$$], this Sony remote control works well. It is easy to hold and controls my Sony TV, Sony Amplifier/receiver, Sony VCR, and Panasonic DVD player. I only had to program the remote to work the DVD player, which was easy to do. The only minor drawbracks to this remote are that some of the buttons are small, and the ""pause"" button for controlling the DVD player does not work - but the stop button may be used for the same purpose."
4,"An excellent simulation of IndyCar, and its 2002 Season","This game, though dated by today's standards, is an excellent simulation of IndyCar and its 2002 season. The drivers are real, the tracks are real, and the cars are real, down to the sponsors on the side pods-except for Penske Racing, as they were covered by the tobacco settlement back then, so they have a generic sponsor instead of their real one. Although I use a joystick instead of a wheel, it's still a fun ride. The music is good, although repetitive. Bob Jenkins, who called races for ESPN back then, and does for VERSUS' IndyCar coverage these days, is a plus, as is Eddie Cheever. One other plus: they're all ovals. No road or street courses."
1,Codemasters IndyCar is flawed and incomplete.,"The game set up is great, but the game play has too many imperfections such as.1. After a caution period, on the restart (if it's in the pit window) every car pits as the ""spotter"" yells ""green!"". Problem is, if you elect to stay out and speed past the pitting cars, the car will turn right into the wall (wreck. yer done). The game shows who you should stay behind. Unfortunately, if you try to pass the car during one of these restart/pit stop flaws, the game makes you pay. Frustrating.2. No driver control when a caution comes out. The computer takes over.3. No driver control during a pitstop. As soon as you enter the pits the game takes over. You regain control as soon as you get to the backstretch.All openwheel sims should take a page or two from F12002."
1,Beware: This book is mislabelled,It is NOT a collection of Emerson works. It is a reprint of a single essay. One of the reviews says it's 850 pages long (it's actually 64) and I think it's the victim of a clerical error at Amazon. It's being mailed right back to them.
1,decieved,"I looked at the book, The Essential Writings of Ralph Waldo Emerson. It had the essays I wanted, and an introduction by Mary Oliver. Then I saw it was availble on CD. I went to the CD purchace page, saw the reviews of the same material as I saw on the book pages. So I order the audio CD. It turns out the CD has less than a tenth of the contents of the book, no Mary Olviver introduction and none of the essays I had originally wanted. For twice the price of the book, I was very dissapointed!"
1,horrendous film,"this movie is awful. it starts out seemingly ok, and then becomes tiresomely cliched and extremely boring. this is not an original film at all--did i say 'i love you' too soon? why won't he call the next day?--has been done to death. a far superior film in a similar vein is 'kissing jessica stein,' which i highly recommend."
2,The end ruins the movie,"Do not show this movie to young girls! The message we get at the end of the movie is that a woman does, in fact, need a man to be complete. It's ridiculous and disturbing."
1,Terrible--don't waste your money,"THis movie is still playing as I am writing this but I feel so strongly that I can't even wait until it is over...This movie is so clearly trying to be Sex and the City and/or Bridget Jones' Diary but its characters are neither attractive nor endearing; they are rather annoying and overconfident. I actually want the main character to fail. The ""love interest"" is an unattractive and undeveloped character....this ""film"" is TERRIBLE and tries to sell a paper thin plot with a few well timed shocking sexual dialogues and scenes."
4,GOOD MOVIE,"This little film kicks the [...] of the over budgeted Hollywood stuff. (I hope to do the same with my comedies, if I can get some money.) It's no way as good as the classic Woody Allen. The word to describe this movie is INTERESTING, and the price is right. Very nice commentary track. Get it!"
5,This doll is great!!!,"This doll was my first bratz doll, and she is wonderful!!! Her hair barrets hold her hair up nicely, even once you take her hair down out of the packaging. Her accesories are adorable and my favorite is her phone. Really a great doll and if you don't have her, I reccomend you go out and buy her soon!"
3,Okay not to good,I bought this doll and most of the picture show here in long hair and after i got here with short hair i find out that she is also avaiable with long almost a complete waste of money and the reason i write 5 * for educaational becuase when i grow up i want to be a fashion desginer and this helps a lot.
5,NEAT!,"I recieved this doll today and I loved her the second I got her out of the box! Mine had different hair to the one on the box, because it was very black and long but it wasn't it those crazy bunchies like pictured, it was in a funky 'Barbie Fashion Fever' like style! Of course, I took that purple hair-band out immediately because her hair was frizzing and getting in her eyes with it in. As for make-up, it is quite dark compared to my other Slumber Party Chloe. She has VERY dark pink lips with a practically red lipliner, her eyes are more slanty than Chloe's, too. She has the traditional-for-Jade brown eyes, like a hazelnut-coloured colour. She has bluey-grey eyeshadow and a pink blush colour over that. She is perfect for any girl. I MAJORLY agree that Bratz are better than Barbies but I still play loads with all of my MANY Barbies! Keep coming up with more great Bratz ideas, MGA!"
1,Jade SuXs,"we are two girls fra denmark. our freind broughtan Jade Slumberparty, and the day after, her hairwas destroyed. Her make-up is too far out, and herpyjamas is OCLY! her accessories is boooring.. soo..dont buy her.. buy:YASMIN OR CLOE SLUMBERPARTY! THEY RULE!Both of us love Bratz - But Jade Slumber Party:/ suXs!!"
3,The Blue Castle,"cheap romance style cover, but don't judge it entirely by that... it has some surprises. nice book for one lounge, on a blue day- as everything unexpectedly works itself out. doesn't follow usual L.M. Montgomery novel premise, as heroine is not an orphan, and doesn't find love and peace in an unexpected atmosphere, and is above the age of twenty there are beautiful discriptions of nature, as usual. must be read in an uncritical state of mind to be enjoyed. Not a classic, not a work of art, but enjoyable."
5,favorite,"This is my favorite L.M. Montgomery book, believe me, I have all her books and personal journals. This is a great mystery of character book, which reminds me of The Princess Bride (Goldman), and You've Got Mail (Hanks, Ryan movie), where one character doesn't know the other character is someone else. Hard to explain. Read it, it is awsome!!!"
4,A good wholesome book,This book is a great read for those times when you don't want anything too heavy. It is romantic without being trashy which is very hard to find nowadays. It was a lot of fun to read and I read it all in one day. I thought it was a little slow in the begining but once it picked up it was quite entertaining.
5,durn good book.,"what i love about this book is that it exemplifies l.m. montgomery at her best. It has themes that interest and relate to an older audiance, but also appeals to the younger reader throught the sheer ridiculousness of some of the characters.Plot-wise, I feel there are a lot of parallels to Jane Eyre, but more ""modern"" and far more flippant.This book is just excellent for all dreamers out there."
3,Two and a half stars rounded up to three...,"This book was okay, but it didn't live up to it's hype, in my opinion. One reviewer stated that this novel was similar to a Jane Austen novel, a statement that I would totally disagree with. The premise is good and although I could relate to Valancy, I never felt as if the author did a good job of fleshing out the characters of anyone other than Roarin' Abel. I think this would have made a good folksy short story, but as a novel, it was unsatisfying. I found myself skimming several pages just to finish it, which is never a good sign."
3,LMM Fan,"I love Lucy M. Montgomery. Anne is my most favorite of all time characters. I read the review saying this was the most awesome of all LMM books. I evidently don't love it as much as they did. Very slow getting into the story. I've been reading over a period of days, which proves it. Normally I can't put a book down till it's done. Probably my least favorite of her works. Anne still rules!"
5,One of LMM's best,"Poor Verity lives a drab, sad life until one day she learns that life will end soon. At last she finds the nerve to leave behind her dull, prudish family and sets off to do what she wants. I found this story charming and wish there had been more in this series."
2,Not very exciting,"Easy read, not to exciting? The story was very basic in character and plot. Did finish it, but, not memorible"
5,Charming book!,"I'm a long-time L.M. Montgomery fan, and The Blue Castle is definitely my favorite of her stand-alone books. L. M. is wonderful at illustrating the trials and tribulations of large extended families, and Valancy's family tops them all! This is a sweet love story, with many funny parts and a surprise ending. You won't be able to put it down!"
5,A beautiful romance,"I love L.M. Montgomery's books, and I'm collecting all of them that I can find. The Blue Castle was a magnificent surprise - a grown up honest-to-goodness romance, filled with humor, heartache, and beauty. I just re-read it again and it gave me the same feeling of happy satisfaction as the first time I read it. I highly recommend reading this book."
5,Dear Valancy!,"This is the most charming and romantic of L.M. Montgomery's novels. Valancy puts aside her old, dreary life of care amongst family members who don't love her. It's filled with great characters and just races by."
5,The very best of L.M. Montgomery's books - hilarious!,"Valancy has lived her entire life under the thumb of her mother, as submissive as a mouse. When she learns that she has a weak heart and may not live much longer, she decides to begin speaking her mind to everyone, thus shocking her very proper family and everyone in town. This book is among the finest books written by L.M.M., and is both funny and touching"
2,I don't like The Blue Castle,The Blue Castle is like a reworking of the Cindarella story. There is also a repetition of themes from the Anne series.
4,"no anne, but a sweet little book","this was a good book. I loved the Anne of Green Gables books growing up and never knew about any of LM Montgomery's other books, so was glad to find this while looking for a beach read. It had kind of a Jane Austen-esque quality-the main character being misunderstood by everyone around her and then falling in love with someone who is also misunderstood, which I liked-as I am a huge Jane Austen fan. Valancy (the main character) also had similarities to Anne of course, who was always looking for her ""kindred spirits"". I thought it was interesting that this was categorized as an ""adult novel"": it's tame enough for a young adult audience as well in my opinion."
4,Lovely story,"This is, I think, the only novel that L.M. Montgomery wrote for adults. It is written just as well as her Anne of Green Gables series with perhaps a little less of the descriptive passages which I think is a good thing. The story still holds the sweetness of her other works. I had been scouring second hand bookshops for it after reading my flatmate's copy.Valancy, upon learning that she probably only has a short time left to live throws her previous passive and obedient personality out the window and decides to say what she really thinks and do what she wants much to the horror of her relatives (and my great amusement).My only complaint about it is that in the Kindle version the formatting is really bad so that every second line only has two or three words in it which can make it a rather halting read until you adjust to it, otherwise I would have given it five stars. It would be fantastic if they would fix that."
5,charming!,"I was looking for a satisfying romance and this definitely delivered! Valancy and Barney are both flawed (so nice to not have unrealistically good, and good-looking protagonists) but complement each other really well. Valancy is wonderfully relatable - especially her days suffering under the repressed gloom and strictures of her family - and it was so nice to see her kick herself loose and say/do exactly as she pleased. A good reminder not to get bogged down by what other people think!"
1,"Read Anne, Forget Valancy!","As a loyal Anne of Green Gables fan, having read all of them twice and the video series multiple times, I was expectant when I discovered this book by L. M. Montgomery. After the glowing reviews I read, I ordered it eagerly. Reading it, however, was a disappointment as the tone is a somber, repressed one, not saucy and bright, like the Anne books. I didn't even give it to my sister, who is another Anne fan, as it would be a waste of her time. I slipped it into the airport trash on my way home."
4,A Good Read,One of Lucy Maud Montgomery's romantic classics. I loved the spirited heroine who learns the truth about herself and others. One of my favorite Montgomery books and a lovely read for a quiet weekend by the fire.
5,Great book!,"This is a great book by the author of Anne of Green Gables. A cute love story, a fun and fast read. Very enjoyable!"
5,"excellent, except questionable age range","I bought this with idea of giving it to a 5 year old. Upon arrival, it seemed much too advanced. You have 4 to 8 years. I checked the DK website and they indicated age 8+. The book is great and will go to an older child. This book is so well put together that an adult would benefit by having it for a reference."
3,Very Good but information not very accurate,Like the pictures and coverage but was not happy with the authenticity of the information.In 5 pages found about 5 mistakes.
5,Woodall's RV Owner's Handbook,This handbook covered exactly what I needed it to cover for my 1975 Fleetwood Travel Trailer. If you don't have the orginal manual for your camper this is the book to purchase. absolutly love it.
3,RV Owners Handbook,"This was okay. It didn't help with referrals for where to find wiring diagrams, but was helpful in lots of other ways."
1,Avoid this disappointment,"Very poor quality video. Definitely not of a Blu-Ray quality and borderline for a DVD. May look good on a small screen, but almost unwatchable on a 56"" HDTV.Was so unenjoyable I had to force myself to watch it to completion.Get Planet Earth instead."
2,the title is bigger than than the content,"The Title is much bigger and more attractive than the content. The film is too slow, narration is too boring, most of the shots are taken from space shuttles.It is much below the expected for a blue ray production."
2,You can do better...,"I purchased this as one of the my first HD DVDs. The videography is wonderful, but this production seemed more like an infomercial for NASA and not something I'd watch more than once.Probably not a fair comparison, but after buying the Planet Earth set, I have no desire to look at this DVD again."
4,"Beautiful, relaxing Blu-Ray","This is a very good Blu-Ray transfer and has beautiful images and commentary of the kind you'd expect from the title. At 40 or so minutes it is rather short, but the accompanying feature is also worth having, though not as good."
4,Great Earth Science Summary!,"This film not only has amazing filming and captures the beauty of our planet, but is also a wonderful Earth Science class summary."
2,Blue Planet [Blu-Ray],I was disappointed in this product. It was not what I expected. I was hoping it was the same (Blue Planet) program that is available on DVD.
5,Too cool,What an awesome IMAX! I've never been to an IMAX theater but I have to say this is pretty cool. My entire family enjoyed it and have watched it several times. It's a regular part of our home school and we refer to it often.
2,My Blue Planet Review,"This movie was not very interesting. I'm shocked at how amazingly BORING this movie was compared to most IMAX films. I watched it as a classroom film. I watched two students fall asleep. One child left the room to go to the bathroom, and didn't come back for 10 minutes! I appreciate what these people were trying to teach us but it would have been nice if they had made it interesting."
3,THIS IS NOT THE BLUE PLANET TV SHOW SHOWN ON BBC/DISCOVERY CHANNEL,"This is the movie made specifically for IMAX 10 years before the Blue Planet television show came out. To all the people saying how awful it is compared to Planet Earth; This movie has nothing to do with the Planet Earth show, and should not be compared.DO NOT BUY IF YOU ARE EXPECTING A DOCUMENTARY ON WHALES/SHARKS/BIOLUMINESCENT CREATURES UNDER THE SEA!"
2,Don't Buy it ! only rent it if you desperate a Imax fan,"I won't not recommaed to buy at all cost, is simply not worth it, the document is too short. Is out of order as well, do not even compare to planet earth not comparison at all, only thing this worth to rent for is to see space shuttle launch in full details and some nice picture shot by satellite in our planet. Most of the scene is really not good, and is lacking information."
3,"Great Quality, Great Purchase","Amazing play back. Amazing scenes and worth every penny. I have found myself more interested in films / documentaries such as these as I sway away from garbage series TV. This is a great watch for not only adults, but the kids as well and definitely worth a purchase for the family. The IMAX aspect of the film isn't even needed and the colors cannot be beat. If you love this, definitely check out the Planet Earth collection.The reason for my rating is that this is not a watch for people not interested in documentary style films."
1,Disappointing,"I bought this together with Planet Earth (PE). I watched PE first which set my expectations for the Blue Planet (BP). I was extremely disappointed. The narrator was extremely monotonous, and did nothing to really add to the experience. The viusals were good, but the stories were disjointed and brief. I expected more. The duration of the film was also very short. I really expected to see a full length video documentary on the oceans, seas, and lakes. PE has sections that cover oceans and seas and that rendition is so much better than Blue Planet. I can see why now it is sold with Planet Earth as by itself it would be a flop. Great pictures though."
4,Blue Planet is beautiful,Blue Planet has beautiful images both from space and on the earth. It also has a vital message for earthlings.
3,"Great video quality, skip the dialog","I recently purchased a Blu-ray player and was looking for new Blu-Ray Disks to play in it. As expected the video for this disk is beautiful, however as I listened to the dialog I felt it was preaching ""enviromentally correctness"" and was rather condecending to people who inhabit the earth. Eventually I turned off the sound and put some music on and was able to enjoy the great video shots in the video."
3,Not what I expected,"After watching and loving the Planet Earth movies I got this one for my husband. It is interesting, but not nearly as well done as the Planet Earth movies. I lost interest and had a hard time following some of the shots they were talking about from space. It's ok, informational but if you want to get something REALLY good - get Planet Earth!"
5,amazing views,"It was a great viewing experience, and very informative...the views were both beautiful and thrilling, appreciativeof the Apollo 8 experienced views of the Earth from theMoon..."
2,Bored to tears......,"This imax put me right to sleep. The narrator talked very slowly, and it was as if she was talking to children. The images were sharp and interesting, if you could stay awake to see them."
1,DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY...,"Entirely too much political agenda behind this movie with all of the statements regarding evolution, global warming, and other environmentally driven and unproven hypothesis that folks want to pass off as scientifically proven facts. There are some good views of earth from space but there is entirely too much dialogue about the damage that man is causing earth and there is entirely too much one-sided viewpoints presented in this. Do not waste your time and money."
2,Go with Planet Earth,"Its got a great picture but the content is less than desireable. Its short and its not even close to what ""Planet Earth offers in the realm of content."
3,"WARNING: THIS IS NOT ""The Blue Planet: Seas of Life""!!!!!!!","This review is NOT for this film, but to serve as a warning to potential buyers. It is apparent that many people, like myself, bought this 44 minute IMAX film believing it is the excellent 8 episode BBC production ""The Blue Planet: Seas of Life"" from the creators of ""Planet Earth"". This is NOT the case. ""Blue Planet"" and ""The Blue Planet: Seas of Life"" are two totally separate productions. Unfortunately, ""The Blue Planet: Seas of Life"" has not been released on Blu-Ray yet."
3,"Blue Planet - Not too good for IMAX, really!","I wish to add my vote of a two or three star rating for this IMAX product. It just didn't do it for me and might be pleasant to play in the background some time you feel like dozing or could use some sleep.Largely a sequence of scenes looking straight down on cloud formations from space, interrupted by brief scenes filmed from the corresponding location at ground level. There were only a few nice image sequences and I've become a little jaded and spoiled over the years by other IMAX productions.IMAX has made much better space specials before featuring footage from the shuttle in orbit. I usually grade on the curve for space materials but this was pretty mediocre compared to other IMAX films."
2,Wouldn't buy this if I had seen before,"I bought this walking through the airport, expecting it to be one of the collection of BBC programmes. Got back to my home country, popped it in, and was very dissapointed. Quality did not seem to be up to blu-ray standard of picture quality.My own fault, I believe I mistook this product for ""The Blue Planet - Seas of Life"", which I have not seen thus far, but I believe is up to the standard of the BBC programmes. In comparison to the BBC line of Blu-rays available, this Blue Planet pales in comparison (not 100% certain that this is not part of the BBC line, but just by comparison of the quality, it definitely does not seem to be).For really stunning visuals, great narration, entertaining and suitable soundtrack, and an enjoyable, engrossing learning experience, get Planet Earth, and the remaining BBC line - Galapogos, Wild China, Ganges."
2,Not the Best of Gary's Books,"I was excited to see this new book by Gary Thomas on the shelf of Logos, a wonderful Christian bookstore. Having read several of Thomas' other books, I expected quality writing presenting prophetic truth.This book, however, disappointed me because the snippets of chapters on various virtues were so clipped that they were shallow on substance. I thought it was a bit presumptuous of the author to extract many of his own quotations to sandwich the chapters--a couple quotations is tasteful, but so many made me question this decision. I also thought the font was too small.Overall, the eyestrain that the book requires makes it even more not worth reading.I do highly recommend Mr. Thomas' other books, though. Especially ""Sacred Marriage."" ""Authentic Faith"" is good too, as well as one of his earlier books that introduce the reader to Christian devotional classics."
2,Not a real journey here,"This is a slim primer on being virtuous, promising much and delivering little. Although it is well intentioned, I can only recommend this book to the curious, not the devout."
5,"The best comic art I have ever seen , great story","This is simply the best aliens comic I have ever read . It has a great , deep plot and the art is amazing . Dan Beuvis is the best artist Darkhorse has, and this book has great movie-like action . Buy it ."
2,3 good mixes only imho,"Eh. Uneven and often boring to be honest. ""Flawless"" is a great song, to be sure. And the Scissor Sister cuts are good remixes. But, for my tastes, in the end the mixes are overly repetitive, unimaginative and often not very danceable. Too bad because on the Touch of Class website they have some really great dance mixes you can download. Go there, not here."
4,ugly but functional,"Hanging your tv on your wall won't win you any design awards, but for what it is, it's great. Just be sure to put some force behind the giant screws that hold the bracket to the stud. I stripped one and had to saw it off!"
4,Where can I buy this video?,"I loved this movie, I especially loved the music too. I have watched this movie twice, just wondering why it was never popular."
4,Great Learning Video For The Kids.,Most of the Leap Frog learning videos are great for the kids. I highly recommend them. The kids love to watch them and I love that they are learning good things at the same time.
4,My son loves this!,My son is 3 and adores this. He loves to sing with scout and friends! He is learning and having fun. Love leap frog products.
3,Okay,"I have a confession to make. When my six year old son is at school, my two and a half year old daughter and I sometimes fire up his Kindle Fire without his knowledge. One of the videos I have downloaded on the Kindle for my daughter to watch is ""Leap Frog Phonics Farm"". I think it is mind-numbingly boring, but my daughter likes it a lot. It covers the same topics as ""Leap Frog's Letter Factory,"" but in a less entertaining way. The upper and lower case letters are introduced along with their corresponding sounds, and there is also a song about vowels. It is probably good for my daughter to learn the same information in a different format. But if you were only going to choose one video, ""Letter Factory"" would be a better pick."
3,Awfully redundant.,"We have a three year old in the office, and we will fire up educational material on occasion to keep her entertained. This one, unfortunately, elicited frustration from her multiple times not even half way through the DVD to the point where toward the end, she was repeatedly expressing that she hoped that there weren't any letters left.Just from listening and poking my head over every now and then, I can say that the program was terribly redundant. While the animation and style of the cartoon is high quality, it consists entirely of a handful of animals standing on a platform, making discussion and jokes that didn't seem to interest the child, and twenty six crates on a train that open up one after another to reveal a different animal starting with a different letter.I'm not saying that this cartoon isn't for everyone, just that it was awfully repetitive in my own opinion, and the child in this instance couldn't wait for it to be over."
4,My son loves this,"Since buying this for my 2 year old for Christmas, he is constanly saying ""watch abc"" (that's what he calls the video). This the perfect video for children who are just learning their abc's."
4,"The alphabet never seemed so long, but...","From an adult perspective, this is fairly hard to watch, especially after the quality and care of Sesame Street and other productions out there. But our 2 year old loves it, and the actual teaching seems effective. In my opinion the music is horrible, but luckily music is only featured in a couple of segments.Shoot, we're watching it again and I guess it's kind of charming. The synthetic, longish songs are the main reason for minus one star."
4,Some pieces are missing,"After reading the ""Devil wears Prada"" it was very easy to understand Anna Wintour's professional style. But other than being charming to men and flirty, there is not a lot of details abot her character. Anyway it is a good read to learn about the fashion magazine politics."
2,"Um...copy editor, anyone?","This book has plenty of entertaining, juicy gossip. But I cannot get my head around the fact that a book with this many spelling mistakes was allowed to be published. I swear I found 20 or more blatant mistakes. For an example of the utter lack of proofreading, Issey Miyake's first name is spelled correctly on one page and then spelled ""Issye"" on another. The worst error? On a single page--340 to be exact--Ben Widdicombe's last name is spelled correctly, and then not five sentences later, it is spelled ""Widdicome."" Unacceptable! The non-existent spell-checking made me wonder if anything I was reading was FACT-checked?! I concluded that this book is quite disposable."
3,A Fun Read of a Cool Life,If you've read The Devil Wears Prada you might as well give this one a whirl over your summer vacation. This is by no means a literary masterpiece (as one previous reviewer said it is a lot of quotes from the same colletion of people strung together) but it's fun and interesting reading about a fascinating individual. Definitely do NOT buy but check out from your local library on your way to the beach for something to do when you're bored. As this is an unauthorized biography there were a lot of important points I could sense that were lacking thus I truly hope at some point Ms. Wintour will cooperate with someone and there will be an authorized biography published.
3,Nothing compared to Vreeland,"I just finished read two smashing books on Diana Vreeland, so I was interested to read Front Row. I had high hopes, not knowing a lot about Wintour, that this would be a great read. Wintour's life is not that intriguing. And compared to Vreeland, her moral compass is a bit off. She seems to be, as my grandmother would say, a bit of a harlot. Wintour may know style, and I love Vogue, but if this is what Wintour is like, she doesn't have a lot of depth. In fact, I got the impression more than once that this is a person who doesn't read--not like real readers do. I'll take Vreeland's outlandish description of ""The Night of the Long Knives"" in her biography over this ""street smart"" clothes horse. But then again maybe high school drop outs are OK if they come from a tony British background and rise to the top of Fashion's bible. Oppenheimer does his best with a subject who may ""sparkle"" at the galas--but is, sadly, just made out of paste."
5,A Mesmerizing bio,"Front Row : Anna Wintour: The Cool Life and Hot Times of Vogue's Editor in Chief is a great, well-written biography of one of the most influential women in the fashion industry.Jerry Oppenheimer is a great biographer and details Wintour's rise to the top.At biographies go, this is one of the best."
3,"A good, if choppy, read. NO pictures in the Kindle edition","This is a fun book and does provide a fairly comprehensive narrative of Anna Wintour`s early life then forward.As seems to be ""de rigueur"" in Kindle versions of hardcover books, there are NO pictures. Extremely disappointing."
3,A gossipy read about the steely Anna Wintour,"I'm not a fashionista but after seeing The September Issue, I became interested in what was happening behind the scenes with the characters involved. This book delves into Anna Wintour's whole history and is interesting in a tabloid kind of way."
4,Fantastic Biography!,"The happiest day of my month is when American Vogue arrives at the newsagency, so I was really looking forward to reading this biography, and ordered it the day it was published. I loved it, and found it was hard to put down. I agree with the other reviewer that there should have been more pictures of a younger Anna. So much detail was supplied about her beauty, and how she used her looks to get ahead and manipulate men. Apparently men found her looks irresistable- it would have been nice to see what she looked like."
3,Halfway through...,"I am halfway through this book, and I am going to stop reading it. It's pretty boring. I was very excited to begin reading this book about Anna Wintour, but I find it doesn't hold my attention. It also jumps around from period to period and it seems to spend too much time on things like her early love affairs and her time at Viva Magazine. It also references too many people, it is impossible to keep track of who's who. I dont know, it just didn't do it for me. I mean, it's mildly interesting, but it is deinitely no page-turner."
4,The cool life and hot times of Vogues Editor in Chief,"Wonderful, interesting, will sit on my bookcase and will reread again"
5,Love This Ring,My ring fits perfectly and looks great. I am totally satisfied. I wear it every day. It was a replacement for my wedding band which was removed following my (our)divorce.
3,Nice addition to the clone army.,"Well, someone needs to fly those clone gunships. . .This figure is nicely scultped, but seems a little dissapointing after the AOTC red clone trooper. The great articulation found on that figure is missing here. No wrists; no knees -what? It's almost the same body, what happened? The head sculpt is nice, but the paint ops are a tad sloppy on some of these figures. The accessories are okay, but be careful not to bump the trooper's loaded laser cannon, or you might be searching your room for that little, green projectile. Looks best on the gunship, especially since those turrets are made for that particular vehicle anyway."
1,O_o,"I attempted multiple times to try and get through this video... The thing is, the lady is less like a mentor and guide, and more like a slap in the face.... Instead of allowing you time to try and mimic her movements, she bends herself in half at speeds that would put Usain Bolt to shame. She doesn't attempt to give pointers, it's just kind of, ""All you have to do is this *ties herself in a pretzel* see, wasn't that easy."" This isn't for the beginner's to Yoga... or even the Intermediates. This is for people who can freely rearrange their spine and then call it a workout."
1,do not like it at all.,Was not what I was expecting for a yoga video. Exercises are boring and each exercise takes forever to complete.
2,Not just stretching... couldn't take it seriously,"When I bought this dvd, I was hoping for a good stretching routine to practice along with my husband. I was not expecting it to be quite so new-agey. We quickly realized that the first part of it was not what we were looking for (chanting, etc.), so we skipped ahead to the first stretching chapter. As we tried to do the stretches, we kept being distracted by the silly things the narrator was saying (such as ""remember to remember to breathe""), and finally we both collapsed in a fit of giggles and turned the thing off. I'm sure that this dvd could be entirely meaningful and helpful to some people... my husband and I are just not those people.So, maybe this video will be good for you if you're really into yoga and whatnot. But if you're just an average person or couple looking to get a good, basic stretch routine in, and you don't want all the fluffy feel-good stuff, I would say to skip this one."
2,I don't consider chanting ultimate stretch,"I was expecting an hour of stretching, but that's not what this video offers. It offers approximately half an hour of stretching, the other half consists of vocal cord stretching with chanting and singing. The stretches, the little that there is of them, are good and work the body. The video is well done, the workout model is lovely, and the commentator's voice is soothing and calm. The poses are easy, although challenging because one has to hold them for extended periods of time. I was disappointed that this wasn't a traditional yogaish type of exercise. The singing and chanting mumbo jumbo was a little far fetched for me-but others may enjoy it. I prefer the Shiva Ria and Deb Dobbin videos, which offer a more comprehensive practice. I would have been more comfortable with this video if it offered an hour of exercise like it states. The ~half an hour of exercise was not sufficient for me."
1,I would donate this video to the library but I wouldn't want anyone else to have to experience it.,"This yoga video is terrible for a number of reasons:1)The routine itself is nothing I have ever seen before in any yoga class or video. I question whether these are actual techniques. They're weird, they hurt, they are not relaxing. At one point you are asked to hold a squat for over five minutes and breathe rapidly in order to, ""massage yourself from the inside out."" It was so bizarre my friends and I watched it with popcorn for the entertainment value.2)This video is also practically porn. I'm almost positive Ana Brett is doing sexual favors for Ravi Singh who then allows her to be a ""yoga star"" or some sort of absurd relationship like that. She also does these exercises in her underwear on a cloud in the video. It adds to what is already a bizarre tape.Do not buy this."
2,too much mid-section lower back exercise too soon,warning.. if you have never done yoga or are just starting this is not for you. it starts with alot of 90 dgr bending down too much too soon i think. i sprang my back the first time i did it and again later. i think it needs a bit more steps to ease into the 90 dgr bending.also all the exercise concentrates mostly on mid section and lower back. for me who uses computer alot i really need some more exercise for shoulder and neck. but it practically has none in that area.its almost like it's an exercise for someone who wants to be flexible on the waist and lower body area and that's it..i wish it contains poses for more parts of the body and not just in one area where one can easily get hurt if not ease into it.this is really more for intermediate yoga practioner.
5,Another A+ for Ana & Ravi,"I just did this entire workout this morning and really like it. I feel the exercises got into some areas of the body that have not been moved in a very long time even though I work out alot. I got a really good stretch and a great overall workout. I feel very supple, very centered and very accomplished! I will be doing this one often!"
5,DOES JUST WHAT IT SAYS!!!,"I was looking for a workout which would increase my flexibility. This one delivers. The reason I need to work on stretching is that I often skip that part of a workout because it find it boring, but with Ana & Ravi's DVD's, it's never boring! Their style is very dynamic but the end result is pure bliss. I can't speak highly enough about this one and all of their DVD's!"
5,Great For Stretching,"This DVD was very helpful in teaching me new ways of stretching my limbs and back area. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a great, relaxing workout!!"
5,One of my favorites,"I have several Ana Brett & Ravi Singh DVDs and this is one of my favorites. I am 36 years old and, although I work out often, I have never been very flexible. This workout warms up your body and through moving, flexing, stretching, and breathing (including breath of fire) safely increases your flexibility. Each exercise is done long enough to let the muscles release. I feel a nice suppleness in my back and thighs and one of my Tai Chi Teachers noted I have gotten more length in my spine and increased range of motion in my joints. I started with Ana & Ravis Beginners & Beyond and had great improvement from that in the way my hips and back feel. I am always recommending that one to my contemporaries as a good starting DVD (It has a great breath primer for the breath of fire too) and now recommend this one as the next step. I love Ravis calm voice, and Anas elegant demonstration. They are a magnificent team!"
5,This Works!,"I thought I had reached my limit as far as flexibility goes but this one stretched me beyond where I was quite gracefully. I found myself getting into areas I had never been before. I feel so much more space in my body. The breathing along with the workout is exquisite. This yoga is more active than other yogas. Passive yoga tends to bore me. This was actually fun yoga, and the time flew. Ravi & Ana are excellent insructors. I love to spend time with them. I have just order their Navel Power DVD. I think it will be nice in combination with this."
2,Not for us older folks.,"In a nutshell, you have a very slender woman whose spine is as flexible as overcooked spahgetti doing some very intense stretching for an hour, in her underwear.One of the exercises had her squatting down, looping her arms behind her legs, grabbing her ankles and breathing in and out like she was giving birth to twins. I guess that's some kind of mystical thing but I since I couldn't do it, I just sat down on the couch and laughed at it. I sat on the couch for most of it.If I were twenty, had her figure and her degree of flexibility, I would probably rate this production 4 or 5 stars; it is that good.However, if you have trouble tying your shoes, this DVD ain't for you! My recommendation for us older folks is Pilates Complete for Inflexible People with Maggie Rhoades. It's a whole lot easier than this."
5,One of the Best I've seen,"I ordered this based on all the five star review's. I am a very picky customer when it comes to yoga/ workout DVD's. This one actually lives up to its reviews. After ""tuning in"" which is a mantra kundlini style ""ong namo guru dav namo"" instead of the usual yoga ""om"". We go into a series of warmups and flexes and the body gets warmed up, worked, and stretched from the ground up.I like the guys voice and the girl is fun to watch. The stretches are good and not like the ones you find everywhere else.This was a real yoga experience - just what I was looking for!"
4,Good stretch workout,"I am a beginner at Yoga and wanted to learn some stretches to help with flexibility and recovering range of motion from some old injuries. I was pleased with the exercises (I am able to do MOST of them as a beginner). She does show how to modify those I could not do. Music was good too. Overall, I would definitely recommend to others!"
4,Good,It's good and I bought another CD too. Seems I lean towards the other one more though as it stretches me out more.
3,Good but not Great,"I'm very active, I lift weights regularly and run a lot which leaves my muscles tight, I found basic stretches to be of little help and I purchased this dvd with the hope it could aid me in improving my flexability. Its OK, not exactly what I expected. While it left me refreshed and feeling good, I was looking for more advance instruction in improving flexability, this to me seemed very basic."
2,too small,The grill was much smaller than we thought. We had the large one but they quit making it. We knew this was smaller but not that small. More for transporting for tailgating. We use it as a fire pit. Not as well made as our old one.
1,Not worth it,I cant belive I paid $80 for this. I saw a simialr prodict in my local grocery store for $13 that would have cooked as well. The bbq does not have any air flow so it wont cook food unless you drill some holes in the bottom. Maybe the worst purchase I havce ever made on Amazon.
4,"Funny, Funny","Clyde L: This is one funny movie,lots of actions with two enterprising gals attempting to blackmail inept bad guys who just can't get a break.The ending left open for a sequel, hope it comes to pass."
4,Who says movies need to be realistic?,"Many of the other reviews have criticized this movie for being unrealistic, but cripes, it's a comedy, it's not supposed to be a documentary! Anyway, this is a great movie for cheering yourself up when you are sick, or watching with your best friend. This is for all intents and purposes, a buddy movie for girls. Are any of the Lethal Weapons plausible? No, but that's what makes them fun. I thought I'd add my two cents since all the reviews I saw were from guys. My girlfriends and I laughed our asses off. And that's what a good comedy is for."
4,"A silly but entertaining ""crime caper comedy""","Two attractive, slightly daffy women overhear a phone call about a heist and decide (unwisely) to blackmail the perpetrators. The story isn't even remotely plausible, but if you're willing to suspend disbelief and go along for the ride, there are some funny bits along the way. If you enjoyed movies like Swordfish, Snatch, True Romance and Nurse Betty you'll probably like this one too."
3,The CD is Blank,The book is a very good starter book for embedded C beginners. The sample project leaves a lot of detail for the LCD display not explained in chapter 2 and 5. I still recommend the book. However the original and the replacement CDs are blank and it is not my computer as the replacement was never in the same pc as the original cd. I really would like a working cd.
4,High Quality Construction and Operation,"These lift support are of high quality and work great. Make sure whether or not you need the ones for rear window defroster or not, as they are different part numbers. You will not have a rear window defroster if you purchase the wrong ones."
4,good overall,"I have the 24"" Omnijig in a small production cabinet shop, we build 20-30 dovetail drawers a month. This jig works pretty well, except just one issue. There is a pin that connects the handle to the part clamp bar, and this pin is too small, and is constantly needing to be replaced. Beyond that, we really like the jig, it is very solid and well built."
3,A strong 3.5 stars,"This album is my first introduction to Ron Sexsmith. I can see where people say this album grows on you. I have a feeling it's already under my skin & I'll listen to it many more times.There's something mellow and approachable about his style, and a familiarity which cannot be denied. He seems to honor his predecessors, yet forge a unique sound for himself.His voice is what really draws me in. I don't go so much for drippy, poppy stuff, and the instrumentation verges on being a little too Adult Contemporary Top 40, yet I'm willing to look past that because his style is so totally his own.There's a sweet quality to his voice that is just uplifting and optimistic. I haven't heard his other stuff yet, so perhaps he does get a bit darker. But overall, I felt this album was solid, upbeat and very melodic."
5,The loveliest bunch of songs you will hear this year,"Don't know if anyone else can write music like Ron's anymore, this album just grows and grows on you. ... Get this album, spin it for half a dozen times, and I guarantee you will fall in love."
5,The photos tell what it was like,"This is a book to mourn the mass murders on that day.Walking from Manhattan to Brooklyn, over the Manhattan bridge, through torrents of horrified people, thousands covered in ash--all deadly silent--this is what it was like. There were no car horns. No one talked. No one laughed. Everyone knew he was lucky.These photographs tell the story. Never forget.--Alyssa A. Lappen"
2,There's a better photo history of 9-11- Aftermath by John Botte,"This book pales in comparison to John Botte's photo book- ""Aftermath- Unseen 911 Photos By a New York City Cop."" I was John's NYPD boss that day and I can honestly say that he did a tremendous job capturing the overall experience from the perspective of someone who had a front-rwo seat to the event and the aftermath. John is a gifted photographer with an eye for poignant moments that stay with you long after you've seen the photos. The text that accompanies makes the book as solid a work as anyone could ever expect.I think that anyone who wants an outstanding photographic tribute to the heroism and selflessness that ruled that day, and the months that followed, should definitely buy John Botte's Aftermath. Everything else just doesn't encompass the entire experience like John's work does."
2,Bad photography. Useless book.,"I don't know what to say -- the photos are just BAD. The development is fine, but the subjects of the pictures are just uninteresting and unremarkable. I bought this book without reading the reviews; bad idea on my part. Instead I'd recommend ONE NATION (by Life), SEMPTEMBER 11: A TESTIMONY (by Reuters), or SEPTEMBER 11, 2001 (by the Poynter Institute)."
1,"Exploitive effort like all the other ""9/11"" books","""A portion of the proceeds will be donated to an accredited charitable organization, The New York Times 9/11 Neediest Fund"" reads the press release from their publisher powerhouse books. Right...How much? One would like to know. Who's profiting?!? All those ""quickie"" books just check this website if you don't believe me: Reuters, Time-Life, now Magnum all try to exploit the profound tragedy which affected deeply this nation. All of them, it seems, look and feel the same to me. Here a sloppy idea is poorly executed. Good pics but bungled by a mishmash editorial efforts, below average presentation and printing. I can see that the publishers have certainly $dollar sign in their minds (i.e. inquiries for international licensing encouraged?!?) Opportunity for the quick buck for Magnum and Powerhouse. This is sad -- what is Monsieur Cartier-Bresson thinking now? Ashamed at his collegues?"
1,I DO NOT LIKE IT,Not worth spending the money on. Low quality binding and printing. The photography is probably the worst ever produced by Magnum. Again everything gravitates around the phortographers. Did it even accur to them what they where photographing? Who cares about being a country boy or objective. Who cares about what Magnum does and how they where born. This book completely misses the big picture. (...)
2,Sub-par effort,"I was very disappointed by this effort, esp. from Magnum, a name I associated with quality photography. Some pictures were ""new"" -i.e., not the usual crop of pictures we've seen. But even allowing for the fact that many photos were taken in the aftermath of the fallen towers, almost all the pictures looked ""muddy,"" grainy and/or dull. Few, if any, of the photos popped out at you with clarity. A real disappointment. Life's commemorative issues (paper and hardcover) did a much better job, though with more predictable photos."
5,Unimaginable photographs,"I bought this book for my brother for Christmas and he was speechless as he looked through the incredible photos. The book was passed around during our Christmas eve family celebration and everyone was moved by the pictures. My sister kept remarking she should have known about this book because she would have given it for gifts, also. I particularly like the end of the book which shows photos of the Trade Center in its glory days and the true way we should remember it. I highly recommend this book. It is a keepsake, not just a coffee table piece."
5,GOD BLESS N.Y.,"This book puts into perspective the events of September 11, 2001. This is a day that we will all remember until the day we die. 9-1-1. It is a number we all know so well. On this day, our lives, and even those not born yet changed forvever. I would STRONGLY suggest this book to everyone especially children so you can see how YOUR future has been shifted from one of peace and joy to terror and fright."
1,GARBAGE!!!,"As a resident of Hillside NJ, Manhattan was just minutes away. Whether I was coming home from work or school, i would always stare at the twin towers from a distance. This book does not help me with my memories at all. The pictures are very poor quality. The book and the pages feels and even looks cheap. The pictures are dark and out of focused. I've seen some of the clips on tv, and they were nice and bright, i look at the same picture in this book and it looks like it was in the evening time. The way the editors describes the pictures makes it seem like gold. To me it was copper. I would give it lower than one star, but it wouldn't let me."
1,"Great Photography, Exploitative Editing","The simple fact that the editors of this montage included on p. 100 a huge photograph of this country's most recreant politician, Bill Clinton, feeding off the grief of the citizens of New York City, is an insult to those good people and the photographic artists who contributed to this book. I looked hard but couldn't find one picture of Rudy Giulani. The publishers of this outrage deserve to be horsewhipped."
2,Not quite right,"It seems like a good purchase when you first begin to flip throught the pages and pages of pictures. But when you come to the end, you realize there is something missing and even a sort of mis-representation. Our current president of the United States, George W. Bush, is not pictured. Neither is the Mayor of New York, Rudolph Giuliani. Two men who have done so much for America especially since this event happened and they aren't even included in this book. There is something wrong with this picture."
5,Moving photos,"A beautiful book about a horrible, sad and devasting day in the life of New York City.I love it: not only you do you see many different views and locations of the destruction and despair downtown, but also feel the intensity in the air. These are more then documentary photos: these are icons. My favorites are Larry Towell, Thomas Hoepker and Gilles Peress.Buy this book!!"
4,"As the cover photo shows, the towers turned to dust...","The Quotes and photos are amazing, I have rated the book four stars because many pages are full photos with no text. That is, little to no explanation of each photo. That being said, the book is an excellent resource all the same. Here are a couple quotes from the book -Steve McCurry: ""The destruction was total. It hadn't stopped at the last thirty floors or even the last ten. There was only this shell. You couldn't believe your eyes.""Alex Webb: ""The wind blew clouds of fine, white powder through the streets.""Such quotes serve to cut through the lies and deception employed since that fateful day. For those who are interested, Dr. Judy Wood has published the first and only forensic investigation as to what actually happened at the WTC on 9/11.Where Did the Towers Go? Evidence of Directed Free-energy Technology on 9/11The Quotes and Photos in this book are a must see for anyone interested in the events of 9/11."
1,Not helpful,"Way over priced. Not a very helpful resource. On a plus, it does include a cd for exercises you find useful. I am a therapist who was mentored in brief therapy. This is not it."
4,Trying To Understand,"Reading this from a patient's point of view, found it very helpful..Have all the info I need regarding my own Bipolar disorder, but wanted to see what therapy could/should offer. Found a treasure trove regarding BP as well as other problems, anxiety - panic, all useful for anybody, good suggestions for mental ""health"".Can't take the place of a live counselor, but is insightful and full of suggestions.Am very much looking forward to the new release in Nov. 2010 Love an author who revises to keep info fresh."
4,A near perfect book on origami,"The origami collected in the book is very interesing. Also the instruction is as detail as everyone-can-do. The only cons is the instruction is on the back of the paper you use for the origami, which means either you have to figure out a way to follow the instruction during the process, or you use other paper."
1,D - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -,this game is BAD because it broke when i played. I dont recommend this to anyone.D----------------------------------
5,FUN PLAYING THIS GAME TIL I RUIN IT,THIS CAME TO ME OK BUT IT WORK FOR A WHILE AND THEN I RUIN IT SO IT WAS A GOOD PRODUCT AND VERY REASONABLE. THANK U JUDY THORNTON
1,VANNA RUINS THE GAME!!!,"Vanna talks way too much, most of it useless commentary, even AI player voices are rediculous. Loads very slow between rounds. Many of the small failures of this game will make you not want to play it. They took a relativly simple game and made it slow-paced and annoying. I don't see how so many people gave this game a high rating. Clearly they don't know anything about video games! Just like the people who creating this one..."
3,Could've been better,"Its difficult to say what happened here. To start off, someone at Atari thought it was a good idea to let Vanna host the game. When i read the reviews, i thought ""This won't be that big of a deal"", we will still enjoy it. Now, after having played through it a few times, the thought of having to listen to Vanna babble is deterrent enough to keep me from playing the game. Its a complete waste of money, when there are online versions that can keep you satiated without all her useless drivel."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS VERSION,"I thought the PS2 version would have an enhancd version of the Playstation 1 editiion. WRONG!!!There is no enhancement and it is harder to operate the game. The Playstation one versions are more fun and easier to play. DO NOT BUY THIS- the graphics are harder to see! A message to game designers-WHY TAKE A GAME FROM PS1 TO PS2 if you don`t design it BIGGER AND BETTER? Stick with the Playstation one versions, they are fun and easier to play!"
2,aggravating,"Usually when I play video games, I play alone using one-player modes. The one-player mode on this game was extremely annoying.The computer players are always yelling out goofy phrases while spinning the wheel; they also seem to get less ""bankrupts"" and ""lose a turns"" while getting more ""special prizes"" than you; I played some rounds where I didn't even get to spin the darn wheel. If you want to have any fun with this game play it with NO computer players. Maybe invite some friends and/or family over to play it with you because like I said earlier it just isn't much fun playin' solo. I give it 2 stars at best."
3,Wheel of Fortune,Spent a lot of time trying to locate this game...Great fun for all ages and family members.
5,THE GREATEST POWER POP-TYPE PUNK ALBUM OF ALL-TIME,"This is pure POP/PUNK THRILLS!!! How anyone could not like it is beyond me - it is to not like rock n roll itself! Or to never have been a teenager! Or to have LOST YOUTH! This is more fun than The Ramones, The Beatles, The Beach Boys (all of whom inspired The Undertones). Feargal Sharkey's got a high, quivery voice, but therein lies the adolescent tenderness amidst the crunching guitar fury. This is ear candy at its most addicting. And The Undertones are THE MOST UNDERRATED BAND OF ALL TIME, SADLY..."
1,Disappointing compared to earlier Magic School Bus books,"My 4 year old son fell in love with the earlier books in this series - Hurricane, Ocean Floor, Electricity, Human body, Water Works, Bees. They are rich in detail, and are very engaging for young exploring minds. This one (MSB Kicks Up a Storm) pales by comparison. Not nearly as much detail. Lacks the quality of illustrations and side-commentary that make the earlier ones so special. This is a run-of-the-mill kids book with nothing much to distinguish it. I have read elsewhere that this series took a downturn when it became a TV show. It certainly reads like a comic-book version of a TV show. Take my son's advice - stick with the earlier books in the Magic School Bus series."
4,Shicka-Shicka Kaboom! The Book.,"It's high summer at school and hot, hot, hot. Carlos is working on a rain catcher, but there's no rain. Ralphie stares out the window and concludes that what they all need to cool down is a big thunderstorm. The only problem is that the kids don't know how weather is made. Is it water? Is it moving air or the heat from the sun that creates weather?Well, of course, there's nothing to be done about it but to get out there, take chances, get messy and make mistakes!The children learn all about weather but not before they are turned into water droplets, ride on falling ice crystals and get whooshed about in a thermal updraft. Shicka-Shicka Kaboom! Ralphie gets carried away as your children will be.Four Stars. These books are very educational, but they are not the easiest read-alouds. (I read them to my 3 and 5 year-olds anyway.)**See the `Search Inside' Excerpt page for an example of reading level. Certainly young children will not be able to read them."
2,An OK Read,"The storyline to this book is good, however, too many characters and the ending wasn't the greatest."
5,"Lots of herrings, red and otherwise...","Skeleton Key is probably the best thing Jane Haddam's written to date -- and that's saying something considering how prolific she's been over these past 15 years. Her writing seems to have come alive and taken a more mature direction. The characters are filled out. The settings are wonderful -- I saw them all in my mind's eye. I know the country club. I know the cemetery. I know the village green, corned by churches. And I fell for all of the traps, herrings and wild geese -- enough so, I could practically hear Haddam laughing over the fun creating yet another 'gotcha!' She's a master (mistress?) of such sly doings and is at the top of her form in Skeleton Key. My only complaint is I read it too fast because I couldn't put it down!"
2,"""Skeleton Key - Skeletal Structure""","Though I have been an avid fan of Ms. Haddam's work for a number of years, I must admit to dissappointment in ""Skeleton Key"". I found Gregor and Bennis to lack their usual electricity,in fact Bennis was a ditherer and Gregor was dull. The suspects were flat and one dimensional. The denouement was a relief, because it ended the wait for the obvious murderer to be confronted. I can not say I'm fond of books where everyone knows the ending except the protagonist. This was not Ms. Haddam's best effort."
2,Sincere but disappointing,"This book was obviously written with great sincerity, so I hesitate to pan it. But I don't want people to waste their time and money, so I'll give my honest opinion.On the positive side, Titmuss has obviously gone very deeply into Buddhist practice and has earned a high degree of spiritual accomplishment. Moreover, the basic concept of the book is good - very short essays about varied topics which express Buddhist ideas in an accessible and practical form.Unfortunately, I found Titmuss' ideas to be very pedestrian. Few of his observations are very profound or thought provoking. There are so many wonderful books about Buddhism nowadays that there's no reason to waste time on this one. Much as I hate to say so, I would recommend that potential readers keep looking."
4,Joy of Sex,I have seen this movie and if you want a good side splitting laugh get this movie. It will take you back to the hi jinks of your high school days. It is well worth the money to get it.
4,"Alan, would you light my Bunsen burner?","This film deserves better. Granted, it has suffered on several levels, from being tied to a title of a book that it had nothing to do with, to John Belushi's death prior to filming. All of this is unfortunate, as a lot of people go into this film expecting something that it was never meant to be. Plus the poor editing certainly doesn't help.All that aside, what we're left with is a pretty decent 80's teen comedy along the lines of Better Off Dead, Weird Science and The Last American Virgin. Though not as classic as the above titles, it shares a lot of the same elements, and has plenty to offer to fans of the genre: some great lines, some genuinely funny scenes, a flashback to that 80's American high school experience that's embarrassingly perceptive enough to still ring true, and the great underrated Michelle Meyrink.It is seriously overdue for DVD release."
5,Could be that evil has heroes...,"Dio doesn't let us down! Strong album again!Hard stomping sound of ""Fever Dreams"" and ""Turn To Stone"", Ronnie's perfect vocals on the anti-ballad ""As Long As It's Not About Love"" and medieval riff in ""Loosing My Insanity"". This is what I call a perfect album. Every song in this album is something special with great lyrics. Since I don't compare Dio albums I won't say that this is Dio's best album to date. If I compared, I would say so but 'cause I don't I just stay quiet... (BTW. Why couldn't Shadowcast be Murray... I miss you Murray! =)"
4,Dio's Magica(l) Return,"The King of Metal returns with the best Dio album in years! However, this is a CD that grows on you, no fast stuff here, the songs are more in the ""Heaven and Hell"", ""Holy Diver"", ""Children Of The Sea"", ""Shame On The Night"" style. I must admit I hated the interludes between the tracks (as this is a concept album), but now that Ive listened to it a few more times, I love this whole CD! Standout tracks include ""Feverdreams"", ""Feed My Head"", ""Eriel"", and ""As Long As Its Not About Love"". All diehard Diomaniacs should get this CD, as well as the more casual Dio fan. However dont expect ""Stand Up And Shout"", ""We Rock"", type songs. Ronnie, Craig, Jimmy and Simon have NEVER SOUNDED BETTER! Excellent keyboards by Ronnie and Craig. No fifth star due to the fact that the song tempo's are basically the same, and although Craig sounds great, to be honest-he's no Vivian Campbell as far as soloing goes, but these are the best rythms since ""Holy Diver"". I give it 41/2 stars. GET THIS CD!"
3,"Vocals Great, Music Drags","Dio is one of the best Metal vocalists ever and still is,but ""Magica"" is a very boring CD. All of the music is mid-tempo and the songs just keep going. The songs are good, but they aren't energetic like previous albums. Like,if you listen to ""Holy Diver"",""Last in Line"", or even early Rainbow, you'll notice there is lots of energy. Unfortunetly, this CD doesn't have it. The CD is good, but it never picks up. Try this CD if you are a true Dio fan, and maybe you'll disagree with me."
4,Classic Dio.,"An interesting return of some sorts to what Ronnie does best,e.g.'Holy Diver','The Last In Line',while 'the future is your past'approach reminds one of Ronnie's lyrics in Black Sabbath.Dio always had the gift of surrounding himself with very talented band mates and this album is no exception,being some of his strongest in years.Time to rock!"
5,Magica is Magical,"Dio's best, which is saying something. The performances of Dio and guitarist Goldy have a level of maturity and taste unusual in the genre. Incredible sound quality and production. A masterwork."
1,This is a joke - Dio's music is now nonsense.,"Simply the WORST (or only bad) release of this great mans illustrious career!! HOW could he make such crap?!?!? The music is dull, boring & lifeless. The lyrics are fodder for a 12 year old (or Manowar fan)! This is NOTHING of a return to the ""glory days"" like Dio claimed it would be. I can't believe all of the good reviews here. Basically, that's nothing more than long-time fans who NEED to believe that this is good, & that their icon doesn't SUCK. Please, do yourself a favor and SKIP this. If you want great Dio, listen to ""Rising"", ""Heaven & Hell"", ""Holy Diver"" or ""Angry Machines""."
2,Not good,"I have said my final words about Dio since he came up with his Angry Machine. This one is better than angry machine, but it is nothing like the old stuff. I was smart enough not to buy this new album, but I borrowed the CD from a friend."
2,TAKE IT EASY . IT's not so good,"DIO sureprised me in this album. It's better than everything he released after Vivian Campbell left the band. But the choice of themes is almost unbeliavable. A ridiculous cover art, adn the same old stories about dragons, kings, sorcerers and dwarfs ... I'm not a teenager anymore ( unfortunately ...)"
1,what is this?,"very, very dissapointing cd from dio. i like dio a lot but thisis awful,slow and prodding along at a snails pace.his last threealbums have been a huge let down and this is no exception! stay a way."
3,Last good album.,"Much better than the terrible Killing The Dragon mess, just be sure to skip the dreadful narration tracks. They are quite ridiculous and really make the whole thing sound like a dodgy Dungeons & Dragons concept album! The tracks are pretty decent, not standout but it's worth a purchase second hand or cheap."
2,Dio rules but this is dull!,I love Dio. Have for 15 years. Love concept albums with wide sweeping operating tunes. But this is just plain uninspired. Goldie is great on the guitar. Whatever happened to the Dio albums that I would sleep with under my pillow because I could relate to them so well? Whatever happened to the days when Dio would sing to me personally? Like when I felt like a left out kid and all I had to do was listen to Rock and Roll Children or I Could Have Been A Dreamer and I would feel like I had an understanding friend....
2,Unique concept....,"but the worst of his solo efforts. His singing was awesome, but the musicianship could have been much better. Also could have let out the dopey 10-minute story at the end. More rock, less talk."
3,less narrative and more magic please!,"ok, anyone with a good quality blank tape can dub the heavy metal tunes and delete the superfluous intros and narrative bits. still, what we are left with is the music, and frankly, this goldy guy is playing some very 90's helmet-style riffs. where is the melodic feel to the material? all of dio's artistic excesses to the side, what remains ought to be picking up where 'dehumanizer' left off. this album does not approach songcraft with anything like that level of metallic determination. though it's been a while, i recall 'strange highways' hitting me much harder and more consistently than this (and i'm no traci g fan). the album sounds really half-baked to me. and what's with repeating whole chunks of songs over again later in the album? I'm beginning to think that dehumanizer and strange highways will go down as the swansong of Dio."
2,You think he would learn...,"I heard great things about this CD, and had high expectations. Then I bought it. I took it back the next day. I gave it two stars just out of affection for Dio, but if I never have to listen to it again, I'll be happy. The first impression from the cover art is a bad sign, then the music really goes nowhere, and the lyrics are disappointing. Few bands can pull off the fantasy themes and sound mature. Dio needs to mature his music because those of us who remember him fondly are all grown up now. What really turned me off about this album was the sophomoric fantasy story at the end... written and read by Dio. If you can't make the story clear with the music, put it in the liner notes. I want to listen to music, not bad bedtime stories for 12 year-old boys."
2,Magica,"This album is not the best representation of Dio. I cannot recommend this album to anyone. I am a very big Dio fan. I like Rainbow and Black Sabbath with Dio, but this album is pretty bad. It is a concept album with a lot of orchestra, and sound clips of stuff at the beginning of most songs. The only reflection of a Dio song is Feed my head, and that's not even that good. The album is low energy and not to good. IT's definite;y not something I would blast in my truck. The main reason I gave this album 2 stars is because Dio Rules."
3,Good Album With The Occasional Great Song,"After a 3 1/2 year absence DIO returns with MAGICA, his first concept album. MAGICA marks the return of guitarist Craig Goldy, bassist Jimmy Ban, and drummer Simon Wright to the DIO fold, and it does have the classic DIO ""feel,"" if not the classic DIO style. Album highlights include ""Fever Dreams,"" ""Challis"" (which sounds like Tony Iommi trying to rewrite ""Cat Scratch Fever!), and ""Losing My Insanity."" Unfortunately the album has too many slow, moody songs, and no fast DIO songs like ""Stand Up And Shout."" This lack of a ""fifth gear"" keeps the album a little too uniformly mid-tempo, which is the only thing keeping it from getting that fourth star. ANGRY MACHINES was a marginally better album, but Ronnie's vocals are much better on MAGICA. It is so close to being a great album, but MAGICA is not quite there. Maybe next time. Still worth buying, though, for long-time DIO fans."
4,"Well worth reading, especially fans of the Delgado Master.","One of the great tragedies of Doctor Who was the early death of the original actor to play the Master, Roger Delgado. Now, with the BBC Books series, fans are able to enjoy new stories involving this definitive characterization of the Doctor's arch enemy.The character in this novel is NOT the Anthony Ainley Master, but is clearly the Master as he was originally portrayed. He is a manipulator of events, truly cunning, and truly evil. Even the fact that the Doctor is not present in the action of this book, and the Master is forced to do actions that ""save the day,"" so to speak, does not turn the Master into a ""hero."" His motivations are truly what one would expect of this evil Time Lord.This book is highly recommended, and is a change of pace from most books of the Dr. Who series."
1,DESERVES MINUS 5 STARS! SAVE YOUR MONEY!,"Picture if you will excited little me hunched in front of the TV set playing ""T-Rex: Back to the Cretaceous"" on my DVD player. The film starts with a boring story of a neglected daughter whose dad is a paleontologist...oops, I nod off here for a while, then the story continues as I watch the time counter on the DVD ticking past 20 minutes, then 25 minutes and I'm thinking, ""HEY! WHERE ARE THE FREAKING DINOSAURS, MAN?"" Next I pick up a magazine...still waiting for DINOSAURS then HOLD ON! There's a couple of seconds of dino action then...THE CREDITS? This movie is a complete waste of time! There are probably about two minutes of dinosaur action tops among the boring, modern-day boring (did I say that already) incredibly boring story! .... This is really a total [disappointment]."
1,Disappointment,Stick to the Discovery Channel series on Dinosaurs and Prehistoric beasts. They are much more informational and done much better. This is a story about a girl's desire to please and impress her father rather than about dinosaurs. The actual segments with dinosaurs in them are fleeting. It attempts to make a point about proving and disproving theories but that gets a little lost in the story line and is never really clarified.
1,T-Rex - Dumb and Dumber,"This boring IMAX movie scared our 3-year-old so much that we had to leave before it ended. Less plot than a 1950s drive-in monster movie, but the same concept: human vs. monster, accented by dark creepy scenes giving you the feeling that a deadly beast is hiding behind the next tree. We expected interesting visual science, not this movie that may forever distort our son's feelings about nature and the unknown. Bah!"
1,Are they kidding?,"I went to see T-Rex thinking I would gain a little knowledge about dinosaurs, but was completely wrong. Within the first five minutes, and seeing about 10 closeups of the girl's face, I was counting down the time until it was over. I almost started laughing in the theater when the girl ran along side the T-Rex after another egg-stealing dinosaur yelling ""Leave that egg alone! Thats not your egg!"" Did they think that this senario was realistic?"
1,Saw this in the Smithsonian,"I saw this in the Smithsonian with my kids, and even with the novelty of seeing a movie in 3D it was *boring*. It was a complete waste of time and money.If you are looking for eye candy, there are very few scenes that actually have ""live"" dinosaurs. If you are looking for science, and you're over 5, I doubt you'll learn anything new."
3,T-Rex Back to the Cretaceous,"The plot is hokey, but my son loves the movie. It was made for kids like him, not me, so if you've got a dinosaur-obsessed child, he or she will probably love it, too."
1,One more proof that special effects don't make the movie,"The best word for this 3D dinosaur romp is: b-o-r-i-n-g. I actually fell asleep part way through. The 3D effects are very good, but you get over that quickly. The story isn't just weak -it's non existent. The science is laughable. I found myself fascinated by how many times the pimples on the teen-age heroine's face moved around. The are VERY prominent in 3D, and provided evidence that the live filming took place over a number of weeks. Your money and time would both be better spent on that root-canal you've been putting off."
5,for those of you who didn't see it in 3-D,"I saw it in IMAX at Universal Studios Hollywood. I admit it was much better that way because that it is the way it was meant to be seen. I believe they did a great job, the story wasn't poor by any means but until you see it in 3-D, don't bother to make a comment about it. I thought it was was one of the best IMAX movies I've seen, but it should be watched as it was intended by the creators. DLJ."
3,Great for children who aren't fanatics about dinos,Clean and decent entertainment. Saw it on the IMAX screen with a 10 year old boy who loves the dino's. He wasn't thrilled but I (33 yrs old and sick of shoot 'em ups) thought it was clean decent and even slightly educational. My dvd collection is 200 movies strong and I will add this for entertainment value for adults and children alike. (Although I know it won't be as grand as on the IMAX screen.)Worth the under $$$ price tag. An even better value at the used prices.
3,Nice see it one time movie,"This movie has two things going for it; the last 10 minutes and a wonderful William Ross score. Seeing it on the actual 3-D Imax for the first time was great. However, on the dvd, with the special effects of the big screen omitted, leaves much to be desired."
2,God Is My Co-Pilot,"My husband enjoyed the book. He is a WW11 buff, but he did say it wasn't as good as the movie, which is unusual. The book lacked the action that the movie had."
2,Too much,Personally I don't like them...and I changed my mind about wearing them so I am going to donate them to the church.
2,hummingbird feeder,nice idea but i seem to have problems getting the jar in and out - it is durable but still find it hard to clean and fill
4,Technically sound in every way- but somehow lacking...,"This is one of those games that is technically sound in every way:- Good cutscenes- Easy to learn interface controls- Use of sound effects from original Defender game- Good graphics quality- Nice to see a bit of history about the old Defender game in the Extras.If you basically want a 3D version of the original Defender arcade game, then this game fits the bill.If you want something that provides new ideas to the genre that isn't already covered in Wing Commander, Colony Wars, Jedi Starfighter, etc... then you are out of luck.It's clear Midway has the technical talent to pull off any game they desire. Now it's a question of whether they can pull of FUN games. In Defender I think Midway was banking on folks who grew up with the original Defender. Unfortunately today's generation of video gamers are too sophisticated for that."
2,Beware the print quality,"I do not dispute Gill's work once bit: a rich work. That's not at issue here at all.The product description for this book states that it is a reproduction with the liklihood of visible anomalies. No problem there. But this reproduction in particular is a travesty: it is one of the worst-quality scan-and-print jobs I've seen. Speaking as one who works in the digital imaging field, this appears to ahve been reproduced without any evidence of high-end scanning equipment or quality control. Some pages are skewed, images did not half-tone (and came out almost solid black)...very poor. Save your money and get a PDF version online."
1,my mistake,"My mistake ... I should have read the description closer prior to buying. This looks as if it is a photo-copy of Gill's original book (the writing is even the old KJV 1611-style wording). Difficult to read and some pages poorly copied. Someone is making a lot of money for very little effort. Do not be fooled as I was, look around and buy a real updated version of this great work."
2,Agree entirely with David Mohler's review,This is a travesty. Sat down to dive in and I cannot read the first page. The third page appears to be similar to a carbon copy. You will not be able to read this book in this form. Save your money and find a good pdf online.
2,Eminem's band is no fun,"I know this is suppost to be fun, but it isn't even remotely fun. I admire Eminem for helping his old friends in the music industry, like Obie Trice. The diffrence is that these guys got no talent whatsoever. It's Eminem's band just like the song title, no one cares about the rest. It was just a excuse by Eminem to appear on tv even more. I normally like Eminem, he's a intellegent and sometimes even funny guy, but this is as unoriginal and outwatered it could be, hence i would know it was a Eminem sound even if the song was instrumental. The song got some attention mainly cause of MTV, on a radio station you wouldn't pay attention to this much. If this is the best song from the upcoming album ""D12 World"" it's not worth the money."
1,Hot Garbage...,"Well to be honest I've never heard the entire My Band song but that is ok. All I need to hear is that annoying chorus after every show on MTV to be driven completely insane. I can never get to the end of the song without quickly switching stations or channels. The chorus is the most annoying thing I've heard in quite a while. That nasal voice on the chorus makes me wanna jump right off a cliff. To make it even worse every member of D12 sucks, they can't rap at all. They are very weak. Eminem has been associated with wackness lately and needs to come with something worth hearing because his 15 minutes are almost up."
2,My Band,"This has got to be the worst song of the year. I would say it's one of the worst songs eminem has been involved with. It might be a little bit better if it wasn't for eminem being the ""lead singer"""
1,GAY!,"This is the gayest Eminem song I've ever heard. This is terrible. With this song, Eminem tries to make d12 seem like a rap version of The backstreet Boys. people call Eminem homophobic becuase he's used the word ""F@&&0T"" in his music a few times. This song proves that he isn't. It is so gay don't buy this"
1,lower your I.Q. instantly,1: buy this cd2: put into cd player3: press play and listen4: you are now dumber!5: enjoy
2,shut the hell UP.,"It's seems to me that anything Eminem touches instantly turns to gold, including this lame a$$ song. Don't get me wrong, there are some funny moments, but my honkey Em really needs to find a new voice because it's starting to grate on my nerves."
4,yah..,"yah you people have to stop obsessing over the ""culture insulting"" and sht like that...if you dont like the song dont listen to it, its as simple as that, there are people making fun of american all over the world, and americans dont seem to know or care, this may seem ignorant but its the way to be because you dont get caught up in the BS. this is a pretty good song but the rest of the CD is 10 times better...also try their other CD Devils Night...the track ""fight music"" is the best...but dont listen to it if you get offended by the SH word :-0"
1,10 Reasons Not To Buy This CD!,"10. This song is ultra-gay.9. The guys of D12 have terrible voices.8. The lyrics of this song are stupiderthan what you would hear on PlayhouseDisney.7. These guys are crazy!6. You'll waste your hard-earned moo-lah.5. This is the worst song on the face ofearth...and the entire universe!4. If you do buy it, you'll be running tothe door and begging me forgiveness.3. Did I say this song was gay?2. Not only is this song gay, D12 are, too.1. THEY SWEAR TOO MUCH!If you do like this song, you're either adrunk person, you have no taste in music,you're in a coma, or you're an idiot!"
3,Could use a competent sprayer,"As to the product in the bottle; it is effective and works with a smell that is better than what the dog leaves behind, but worse than many other things. It works though. As to the sprayer, I'll be buying the larger bottles and adding my own sprayer in order to have one that works well."
1,Title is misleading,Watercolor Secrets is anything but. If Reid reveals any secrets about painting water colors they went over my head. This is just anotherbook that the beginner painter can do without.
3,Charles Reid's Watercolor Secrets,Charles Reid is a wonderful artist. I enjoyed reading the book but it falls short as an instruction manual as it is very difficult to understand from the text and illustrations how Charles actually achieves his very loose wet in wet effects.
2,Just an excuse for another book,"The title of this book is rather misleading. I had thought I was going to get some real expert tips on watercolor painting but instead this book is just a reprinting of the artist's watercolor ""NOTEBOOKS"" with VERY little in the way of useable and tangible tips about painting in watercolor. The book is slender, sparsely laid-out and over-priced at that. It struck me as just an excuse for a book with a cleverly disguised title to market and sell it (everyone wants the ""secrets"", right?) . Save your money!"
5,"Excellent story, excellent merchant.","I had read this novel a little while ago and decided it would be a good gift for my long-term girlfriend, who has recently developed an interest in graphic novels. (After a lot of wheedling I finally got her to start reading Y: The Last Man, and she's hooked. Why don't people ever believe you when you say they'll enjoy something?)Blankets demonstrates that a 'comic book' can tell a quiet, poignant story effectively, with gorgeous black and white ink drawings and brilliant prose that a reader of Action Comics might be surprised at.Also, the merchant was excellent. The book arrived several days before the estimated date, and was in perfect condition, snugly and neatly shrink-wrapped with a stiff cardboard panel to prevent it knocking around. After shipping, this was still less expensive than any in-store copy I could find. This was the first thing I ever purchased on Amazon and it's been a great experience. I am very pleased."
5,Awesome graphic novel.,"Good book to read, lots going on in the story, very entertaining I would recommend this book for high school kids and older."
5,Love changes like the season,"what can I say, this story sounds like a summary of my life and it left me with the feeling love is just a fase it's self.Story: 9/10Illustrations 9/10"
5,One of the best graphic novels ever,"I thought it would be good but, it was too great for words, i found it even more amazing that most of this happened to him, the drawings are excellent, perfect for any aspiring artists, or if your just looking for a good story. It also has the best combination of funny and sad as hell, and its really well written."
5,"Incredible, powerful read","One of the best novels, graphic or otherwise I have read. I could relate to the main character in many ways (crazy conservative religious family, religion and coming of age, Enlightenment). Highly recommended and well-written."
5,Absolutely Splendid,The author accuratly portrays a typical Central Wisconsin teenage love story. I have lived almost my entire life in a town only about 15 miles away from the town in which the story takes place; the authors hometown. It is rich in local color and was reminiscent of my own formitive years.
5,Read This Book!!,"A lovely, breathtaking book... the pictures are as beautiful as the text. This is one of my very favorite graphic novels!"
5,Feels like a cozy warm blanket on a snowy day.,"Perhaps I am a little biased in favor of this book; it mirrors my own first (and continuing) love and the slow, tender way a socially awkward misfit intertwines his life with a more well-adjusted but kind-hearted girl. The storytelling doesn't let you put it down; I read this in two days only because not sleeping at night was not an option.I liked the ending a lot, although I know it does not appeal to all readers. Sometimes things turn out different than one expects, and we have bittersweet memories to keep for the rest of our lives. This book is full of them."
5,A Masterpiece in B&W sequential art,"This is a coming-of-age tale that everyone can easily relate to. Its themes of spiritual awakening, vulnerability, longing, isolation, etc. are things most of us have experienced at some point in our lives. Yet the sincerity and kindness in which the tale is presented make the story so powerful. You'll probably be in tears by the time you finish this book if you're old enough to remember a time where people didn't have cell phones. The art is amazing as well, even better than Daniel Clowes' work in my opinion."
5,The Best Thing I've Ever Seen...,"This is, without a doubt, (as the title suggests) the best thing I've ever seen. Craig Thompson is amazing. The artwork is so beautiful and the story arguably the most inspirational thing I've ever read. Truly amazing. I HIGHLY recommend it."
5,Do Unto Others,"This book is excpetionally well done because of the use of the words that correspond to each picture(s) that it narrates. The way the words are written or scrawled makes the pictures that more intense and in depth simply because each picture itself is full of detail. Plus the use of black and white doesn't draw attention away from any one point in the picture that needs to be concentrated on.Aside from the pictures and whatnot, the story of the book is exceptional because it's based on life, but it's not imbelished nor does it concentrate on awkward life achievements. It's based on life in general and the progression of one through loss and various other experiences that come about in life."
5,a beautiful work of art,"Craig Thompson's drawings are infused with emotion. Where other graphic novelists have experimented with changing visual styles based on the characters' emotions, Thompson's world flows and swirls with feeling. From time to time, it feels nearly psychedelic -- and i mean that in the most positive possible way. Senses are blurred as joy becomes visual, or terror more visceral. I couldn't put this book down, as it's a joy to read, and fascinating for the story as well as for the artful way that it is told. Thompson has lead an interesting life."
4,Perception.,"Blankets forever changed my sterotype of graphic novels. Poetically penned and beautifully illustrated, it's a bittersweet look back at the turmoil of love and adolesence."
2,surprisingly religious,"Although described as a graphic novel about first love, it is overwhelming about seperating yourself from religion and the known world around you. The drawings are dark and flow beautifully on the pages but the story creates a barrier between the reader and the book. The religious themes of restraint and power are too prominent and suffocate what could be a whimsical story about being young and finding someone who understands you, who you are connected to."
2,Big let down,"Blankets had it's moments. But the ending was pretty limp IMHO. You'd figure that after all Craig went through he would lead you to some conclusion, but at the end he was even more confused and depressed.So what's the point after all 600 pages? A big disappointment that's what."
5,"breathtaking, and I don't use that word lightly","I am not a big fan of Goodbye, Chunky Ric, but I find Craig Thompson's sophomore effort to be one of such intense beauty and personal joy and despair that I fervently recommend it to anyone, regardless of their feelings about graphic novels. It is a classic work that I sincerely hope will be remembered and reread for years to come."
4,I really enjoyed this!,"I'd never read a graphic novel before so I was pleasantly surprised at how well the story was conveyed through pictures. Sometimes I thought there were too many words even. I could really identify with the ""story"" even though many critiqued that there was no story. It's a 580 page book--theres story! Whether you enjoyed the story is a whole different... story. Wow, this is not going at all as planned. Anyway. I think it's definitely worth the few hours it takes to read. I read it once straight through and then read it again just looking at the pictures. I would own this book and read it from time to time, gladly."
4,A story that raise emotions!,"I liked the story. I am always more impressed by sad ending of a story, but for this one I was wishing for a happy ending!. I even google the characters looking for a sequel but I couldn't find. A real piece of art, but a depressive in same time."
5,Amazing!,"Well I managed to finish Blankets in only a day. It turned out to be a beautiful story about first love, and siblings. However, it also incorporated themes of religion, being a teen, fitting in, divorce, molestation, and mental disabilities. Thompson's life has been quite a roller coaster. I really enjoyed the illustrations of this book, and the story was very good too."
4,Mildly overrated,"This is a strong work, and bodes well for Craig Thompson, who appears to have hit it big. And all the more power to him, he's created something that flows well and connects with readers on a very deep level. However, the almost masturbatory level of intimacy in the book (due to the biographical nature, it's ALWAYS related to the narrator) causes the other characters to come off as simply tools for the story, and the focus on organized religion takes away from what it ends up as an almost anti-climatic love story. That doesn't take too much away from what is certainly a well-written and skillfully drawn work of graphic literature that will be remembered for years."
2,Disappointing.,"Maybe my expectations were too high. I read this book because it was recommended by a friend who had also read (and loved) Jeffery Brown's relationship-based graphic novels. I started Blankets expecting to find the same examples of intimacy that I thought were present only in my relationships, but surprisingly turned up in Mr. Brown's as well.I found this novel alternatingly trite and elusive. I was frusterated almost the entire way through, maybe frusterated for him, maybe just frusterated with him.That said, some of the artwork was beautiful."
5,the BEST Comic Book ever... no joke.,"Now.. I looove super heroes. Green Lantern, the Flash, the X Men... love em! But you'd never ever see a story on this level of quality in those books. Blankets blew me away. Iv'e been reading these reviews and was surprised to find that just like me, many of there people have read the book in just one sitting. It took a chunk out of my sunday but it was well worth it. That following monday, i took it with me to work and lent it to a friend of mine who just has a sort of casual interest in comics... she loved it. When i got it back from her, i lent it to my best friend, a super hero comic book fanatic... he loved it.This book has the ability to communicate with you on a level everyone understands. It's a touching story and i'm glad it wasn't a movie-like happy ending because thats not what real life is.(...)"
4,"I cried, it hit the emotional spot for me","Cheesy and sentimental, still I loved it, it tugged on me in just the right places to remember first love lost. Perfect for that infatuated teenager also."
5,American Literature or just a picture book?,"For the past few years, I have had my juniors read this either at the end of the year or in the middle and asked them to consider whether or not this is a useful text or just a picture book. Invariably, they come to the same conclusion that I have that Mr. Thompson has created a dynamic and exciting text that is also a welcome edition to the American literary canon.Parents even read it and love it!One student was even bragging to an honors kid that her class was reading 100 pages a night!"
5,"600 pages of graphic art autobiography, romance","Most graphic novels are relatively slim, attesting to the amount of effort involved in evolving a graphic plot: not so BLANKETS, which sports nearly 600 pages of black and white illustration and offers up a blend of autobiography and a close inspection of romance and involvement. BLANKETS is an important achievement in graphic art: it covers fundamentalist belief, love, and life's transitions in much more depth than graphic novels usually offer. Very highly recommended."
5,Want to be a wordsmith?,"Here's the deal: Take a weekend to read through the 256 pages of this inexpensive, easy-to-read reference guide and you'll soon know more about English usage than 95% of the people you work with. Even the English majors, I kid you not.You'll soon gain the reputation of being the office wordsmith. People will look at you differently. You'll gain more respect. And you'll get a 120% raise come review time. (OK, maybe you won't get a raise, but you will feel pretty darn knowledgable. Oh, what a feeling.)God bless you, Mr. Bernstein, wherever you are. I just wish I had all of your books when I was still in college."
2,"Great stories, poor book quality","I enjoyed the stories told in the book, but this edition looks like it was photocopied and bound at a local print shop rather than at a serious book publishing house. The amateurish print and photo quality really diminished the book as a whole. I will not order anything else online from this publisher again."
3,What did the hippies know anyway?,"The Flamin' Groovies major label debut, the already-old school rock & roll of Supersnazz entered the 1969 San Francisco pyschedelic milieu like a trouser cough in a crowded elevator. At the time, the Groovies' brand of trashy R&B revisionism was considered closer to the cheap nostalgia of Sha Na Na than the rock-as-art zeitgeist. But time, it turns out, was on their side. Supersnazz is a fine document of Nuggets-era garage rock, its only flaw being that the sound was cleaned and polished by the record company to within an inch of its life. Subsequent releases would see the Groovies correcting that mistake with gusto."
4,Good introductory information about Henry VIII,"My favorite thing about this edition of Henry VIII is the introduction, which contains very clear, interesting, and objective views about which scenes were written by Shakespeare himself and which are likely to have been written by collaborators."
4,We like it,"I don't know what everyone is expecting when they buy this doll. I happened to come across it while shopping and bought it for my almost 6 year old since she has been in ballet since she was 3. I thought is was cute. The music is sweet and its just a doll. I don't know why anyone would rely on ads to show you what it can really do. My major disappointment was the scrunchie that doesn't stretch big enough to get around your pinkie let alone around the dolls hair. Both of her sisters like it too. If you don't have commercial expectations of it coming alive, there is no reason it wouldn't be a great gift for your ballet enthusiast."
4,We weren't so thrilled.,"My daughter loves the doll and the doll is pretty however...It isn't easy to make ""dance"" and the barre doesn't stand up nicely so she has been frustrated."
2,Cute doll but doesnt dance well!,The doll looks really fun in the packaging but it really is hard to get it to spin and do any dance moves without it falling down. Also all you can do with the bar is press it and it plays music. The doll cant hold on to it or anything. It basically just sits there. Really not much fun.
1,Major Disappointment!!!,"My 6 year old ballerina was ecstatic to receive this for her birthday. Unfortunately this doll is not worth the money it cost to make it. You can not make your doll do the ballet positions. The advertising leaves children to believe she will dance for you. Not true, you have to make her pirouette and her feet have to stay pointed. The feet end up going flat, and she slips all over the place. The ballet bar requires batteries to play ballet music. Can I ask you? What is fun about a ballet bar that plays music when your doll won't even dance? This toy is a expensive dud. My daughter was major disappointed. It was played with for a total of 5 minutes, and will spend eternity in the bottom of the toy box with the rest of the expensive toy duds that seem to be commonplace anymore. If you are going to want a doll that is educational, playable, and keep your child interested, spend the extra money and invest in American Girl dolls."
2,skip it,"Looks great in the package and adds, but not worth the money unless you have a kid that just likes looking at her toys. Hard to work, doesn't dance or spin easily and an overall failure. SHe'd have had more fun with another barbie."
3,Confirm Edition,"The book came through the mail exceptionaly fast and was very pleased. When I opened the package I then realized that it was the wrong edition. It was entirely my fault for not confirming the edition with the seller. When I ordered it, it said brand new with a CD. I thought that meant that it was the newest edition because usually the CD gets lost with the older editions. I don't know if I would have bought this book knowing that it was two editions old. The book was a little over priced considering the edition is no longer used. Fortuanlly, I was able to use most of the book in class. Excellant delivery but I would just email first to confirm what edition it is."
4,Good wax,"This is the olny wax I have ever tried for personal use. Because it works well enough, I haven't tried any others. I have a wax warmer and the wax heats quickly to a nice consistency that is easy to work with. I tried using it on my nether region several times, but it was so painful, and it didn't remove the hair as well as I had hoped. I tried SEVERAL times as so many other reviewers loved it I thought I just needed practice. It left behind too much hair down there for the pain that it caused. SO I now use it for my upper lip, chin and inbetween my eyebrows. It works pretty well for that. It takes off most of the hair and any hair left pulls out easiy with tweezers. I have bought 3 tubs and will continue to use unless someone says there is something better out there."
2,Not the greatest wax,Not the greatest wax. It is okay but I found that the wax doesn't bond well with the hair at times.
2,"It breaks and can be quite painful, I've had better wax before","I would not recommend this wax. On the lowest setting of the Gigi warmer it is still very fluid and drips of the applicator which makes things messy. When it's actually on my skin, it sticks on the skin very much, not just on the hairs. Moreover, it often breaks when I try to pull it off. As a result, it's even harder to get the rest of the wax off.I prefer more flexible (elastic) wax which doesn't break when you pull it off. I will not buy this wax anymore."
4,"Good for Facial use, make sure not hot.",This is not as effective as hot wax but i like that it doesn't stick to the skin and hence very effective and gentle for the face. Using this for Brazilian or bikini area is very very painful. I do not recommend it for that area. Hot wax is must faster and less pain.
3,decent,"Still learning how to use this wax. It's supposed to be the hard kind that doesn't require strips. However, I've applied this thinly with strips and it's been fine. I'll have to try and build it up."
3,not the best... go with the version that uses strips,"goes on nicely, but very difficult to remove because you have to pick it off. it doesn't come off easily with one pull. it sorta flakes off in pieces and is very messy. also, very hard to clean off the skin because of small pieces that remain. i've used it twice. once with thin application and once with thicker application. i found that both ways have the same problems."
4,Some skill and experience definitely required,"You definitely need some skill and experience when using this wax. I've actually never waxed myself, so this was probably a lot more painful that it would have been if I had more experience. Still, the wax is great. Where the wax is applied, all hairs are completely removed. Even though it felt like my skin was getting ripped off while I was doing it, probably incorrectly, my skin remained completely in tact and completely pain free once the hair was removed. I'll definitely be purchasing this wax again once I use what I have now. I feel so smooth!"
5,Awesome wax!!!,"I've tried all different kinds of wax and the GIGI Hard Wax is by far the best. The trick is to apply a thick layer and never let the wax get too hot. So I'd suggest warming it up on the low setting even if it takes longer. Also, dont let the wax get too dry on the skin, because then it becomes brittle and hard to pull off."
5,Just like european wax,"I am european and back there, hard wax is used all the time and it's not expensive at all to go to a salon for waxing. Sooooo much different here in the states. I had a hard time finding a place that uses hard wax and when I did, they wanted $60 for a bikini wax!!! So I was happy to find this. It works great and the quality is awesome. Great for home use"
4,decent quality. hard to warm up,i guess there's a reason why they sell a warmer for additional cost...but this wax has a strong hold and gets the job done effectively.
2,Not a 5 star product,"I gave two stars because it's painful on the bikini line (what I bought it for). I followed all the great reviews on here from everyday people but I found it painful & messy. It leaves pieces of wax in spots on the skin. I have to slather on lotion afterwards & then pick, pick, pick, until it all comes off. I thought it would be cleaner & easier than that but it's not. If you're not a professional, you may have ISSUES like I do. But I still use it when I need to & it does seem the hair grows back slower. It does NOT prevent ingrowns though. 1st time I used it, I got a horrible one that's still a dark brown scar, over a month later. I'm a fair-skinned Caucasian."
2,This is the same as another product I was trying to to replace,"It's the same thing that Sally's carries, but with a different label. I didn't like either of them, they're the same.I am still not sure if you're supposed to use strips with it or not. It doesn't seem to work well either way, although I like this line."
1,WORST WAX I'VE EVER USED.,"I had to give at least one star rating, but honestly I'd say maybe it's worth 1/2 of a star. I have worked at 5 star spa/salons and know my stuff! I tested the wax first on my arm, following all directions. The wax doesn't get all that hard like other hard waxes, so it can be messier, and really a pain in the @**. Anyways, the next day after testing the wax on my arm, my arm was COVERED in loads of small red bumps, that looked like I had been attacked by 100 fire ants. Sufficed to say after that there's no way I want to give myself a brazilian with this CRAP. I wouldn't want my lady parts looking that way. Very SCARY! $15 down the drain."
1,Awful stuff,"All this wax did for me was to break off the hair to stubble. I might as well have shaved. Plus, it left bits all over my skin. As an added treat, even though I used a collar on my wax warmer I'm going to need a crowbar to remove the can."
1,big NO-NO,"if this is brazilian wax, I am Giselle Bundchen. Just awful.I have been using wax for 20 years. I always bring my wax from abroad. I chose this wax just because it was hard and usually that's the best type of wax to use. However after the first try I just tossed the wax away. It is like trying to wax yourself with chewing gum. It is so sticky that you need rubbing alcohol to clean your hands. Just awful."
5,Radiator,Radiator has restored my confidence when driving in the heat. I'm no longer periodically peeping down at the gage to see if the needle is moving. Its a worry thats gone and I'm happy it left. I'm extremely happy with this product!!!
5,Junk or Junque?,"Emyl Jenkins ""Appraisal Book"" is written for any level of antiques collector.She defines what antiques are, categorizes many periods, styles and different types of antiques,as well as collectibles, and helps the reader understand how to begin the process of valuing an antique. She uses humor and a down-to-earth approach to make her points, and makes the entire process of ""antiquing"" approachable even to a novice collector."
2,appraisal book assistance,"Shipped prompted,received in excellent condition.Book was returned, due to lack of info on antique clocks, long case & etc.prompt refund without hassel.Book good assistance for other types of antique appraisal info."
5,6 year old LOVES this game,"I got this set of UNO cards for my son for his sixth birthday. He absolutely loves this game. He had never been introduced to UNO before and he is crazy about it. It's the perfect game for children and adults to play for family fun. I remember playing UNO as a child with my own family and having a blast. The Spiderman theme and the awesome Spider Sense card make it even better for your boys who love Spiderman. I have already played countless games with my son. I use it often as a bribe to get him to do things around the house and it works! ""Just one more game, Mom, pleeeease."" He loves it!! A perfect birthday gift for 5-7 year olds."
3,ALL ABOUT BOBBIE BURNS,"This book is an exhaustive biography, giving you all (and more than) you need (or want) to know about Burns and the Scotland where he lived!"
1,PLAGIARISM!!! BEWARE!,"It is sadly known in the scholarly world that this and many other books by this person are low-quality acts of plagiarism. It should not even be on sale, as many other bookstores that have taken his books off the shelves. Shame on him and shame on Amazon. Anyone can check the news on the internet searching for ""mackay""+""[...]""."
3,"Good book, needs updated","At the time it was written, it was excellent. But with the constant court rulings that seriously change both our privacy and civil right laws, the book needs to be updated. The best way for a citizen to be aware of his or her rights is to consult the latest state Penal Codes."
4,Informative.,"If you've been hassled by ""The Man"" and want to know your rights, this book will tell you what you need to know. I doubt my rights will be stepped on again."
3,Great except for one thing,"Excellent book except for one thing. As a minority woman, reading his little comment at the end about minority cops ""having a chip on their shoulder for no reason"" really pissed me off. I would have rated 5 stars, but for that, no."
1,I feel sliightly (?) paranoid dillusional,I believe based on my background that this book and what it recommends will only serve to place the individual in a no win situation overall. I am sorry I purchased it in all respects. If you have limited experience in the area this book is not for you!!! The author cops out so to speak with the admonition he is not a lawyer and that your actions are up to you so somewhat relieves himself of any responsibility for you going down in flames.
2,Decent price,I purchase it because it was similar to the one I had that broke in a high wind.Will not pull in the stations that my old one did.
3,Not very durable,"I was browsing for jewelry for my wife for Valentine's day and stumbled across this item (again). You see I bought this for my wife last Valentine's day and she wore it for about 2 weeks rotating with another ring I got here from Body Candy as well. At the end of the second week we noticed that some of the interior petals had fallen off two of the three roses and by the end of the first month, one of the roses had broken off and been lost. She was a student at the time and hardly led an active lifestyle so we're not sure why it wore out so fast.As a side note, the second piece lasted much longer; about 7 months of continual use, before breaking as well. Not bad for the price I suppose, I never expected them to be heirlooms."
2,not impressed,Did not really like this that much. This guy sounds like he needs to be on oxygen!! There were bits and peices that were okay but not enough to buy this.
5,My little gabriel loves it!,"we were preparing his first birthday party and he was in love of cookie monster and sesame beginnings, is a toy he can use because is made with a great material."
5,ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS IN STAR WARS HISTORY,"I thought this was brilliant we finally get to see Luke portrayed as a human being instead of a weirdo with strange powers and Leia as more of a mother. We also get to see Jaina, Jacen and Anakin's point of veiw on the whole situation. The plot was interesting (although the ending was a little abrupt)and it was a star wars novel in a style all of its own. I say READ THIS BOOK you won't regret it"
5,?,"I have no idea why no one liked this book. Good plot, good characters, altough the pace is slow at times."
3,the crystle star,"this book was great......many people havent read the earlyer books and i have, it is engaging, the thing was that the luke, and han solo parts of the story, wasnt that great. the author wasnt descriptive at all. so it is hard to paint the picture in your head. the book is called the crystle star, but most of the story was about leia's kids getting kidnapped, and it is supposed to be about the crystle star, which the story seemed unfinished. the book, was confusing and poorly written, and not descriptive at all..."
4,"Not the best, but very good nonetheless","I read this book twice, once when I was a teen and then again a couple weeks ago. I loved how they portrayed the solo children, though Luke's characterization was quite bad. The plot was a little lacking, but still well written. The story went by slow due to the sections of inner-thought for the characters, but the plot itself went by very quickly."
4,Star Wars,"This is an interesting, though unusual Star Wars story. Parts of it are funny. This book has among other things: Ghostlings (aliens with a fatal attraction), Leia's children being kidnaped (again), a woman from Han's past, a wyrwulf (that changes into something else), a black hole, a crystal star, and ""anti-Force""."
2,Star Wars can do better.,"This is quite simply a book that did not live up to its potential. It started off boring and ended with a dissappointing conclusion. Even though I love Jacen and Jaina, this book really never made me care for either one of them. They seemed stuck up, snooty, and were constantly whining. A friend that they meet, Lusa, is essentially a glorified centaur. This really bothered me, because in Star Wars you would think that an author could manage to think of some half way original creature. Everyone acter uncharacteristically, particularly Luke, who seemed depressed and self centered. Han and Luke's purpose in the story was pretty forgetable, and the bits with Chewie in them were truly abysmal. If I didn't reserve the one star rating for books like the Black Fleet Crisis, or I, Jedi, then I would have rated this book that way. Buy The Courtship of Princess Leia, or Tales from Mos Eisley Cantina instead. You will thank me later."
1,Not up to the level of other books in the Star Wars line,"The plot itself was pretty weak, and the characters were not portrayed well. Many of the story concepts were entirely to far-fetched and many things were left unexplained (or inadequately explained, i.e. Luke's temper). The introduction of more ""lost Jedi"" was ridiculous and undermined the storyline set up by previous books in the Star Wars line. McIntyre fell short of Zahn's mastery of Lucas' universe, and this addition to the Star Wars timeline tarnished what other writers had done before."
1,This book was horrible!,This is without a doubt the WORST Star Wars book I have ever read. And believe me I've read 'em all. It is totally bogus! Ms. McIntyre is giving the Star Wars name a bad rap with this book.
1,"Man, this book is so bad, its fun to review it!","This book is absoutly horrible. Not only does Han cheat on his wife, Leia, in the book, they have to have some person who had a scientific body builder make him, hero of Star Wars, seem like a puppet. On top of that, it continually made Anakin seem superior to Jacen and Jaina, two of my favorite charectars, and had a dark jedi that was wasted, without a single lightsaber duel. That's the point of those charectars! Not to be eaten by some stupid creature the author took the liberty to make up! Don't read this book, because it'll just give Star Wars a bad name! McIntyre should have stuck with Star Trek!"
4,A definite page turner,"The book was very exciting but it lacked one thing , action. If you like Star Wars, you will like this book."
1,bottom of the Star Wars barrel,There is not contest for the worst Star Wars book ever written. It is here! This is a waste of trees. You could plug any Sci-Fi character into this story.
2,worst Star Wars novel I've read yet (and I've read alot),"I'd have to agree with every other reviewer in saying that this is just a downright horrible book. The Crystal Star takes place when Han and Leia's kids are about 4 or 5. They get kidnapped (predictable) by 'The Second Imperium' (predictable) and are forced, along with other kids, to train to serve the Empire (predictable). Oh, and it's controlled by a guy who force-chokes people and laughs (predictable). To add to the atrocious plot, it was written badly, or not very descriptive on characters or events. Pass this one by."
4,"It was good, but only 1of the 2 lot lines were interesting","This book was pretty good. However, only one of the two plot lines were interesting. the Luke/Han/Waru thing just stunk. I only read it so i could get on to the part where Leia is looking for her kids and (my fav part!)the part where Jaina, Jacen and Anakin were when they were kidnapped. This part was told through the eyes of little five-year-old Jaina, who is my favorite of Leia and Han's kids. Jaina just sounded so cute and innocent and she was trying to be so brave and she was so sweet that i just wanted to hug her. Those kids were really smart and i liked Lusa. Also,i was hooked by the first sentence(it started with Leia, my all-time favorite SW character). I dont know why everyone hated this book. I mean, i too hated the second storyline, where EVERYONE was out of character and the plot just didnt make sense...but it was THAT bad. I liked this book. A lot."
3,"Essential plot development, but questionable otherwise","I second the slow plot and slow characters complaints, just not as strongly."
1,"A bad book, but don't get too hard on McIntyre.","Okay, we all agree that this is not a good Star Wars book, but when I was reading some of the nasty comments about Ms. McIntyre, I had to step in. 1) Even though the book is a failure, doesn't mean that she is. I mean ""sucky trekkie woman""? Give me a break. Star Trek's not as bad as that. 2) She's never written Star Wars before. Maybe she was just trying to get the hang of the characters and planets. 3) Even if I'm defending her in vain, I think that every one of you who despises Ms. McIntyre and laughs in her face should try writing a Star Wars book of your own! See how the reviews about it. I'm writing a sci-fi book myself, and it's a lot harder than it looks. SO STOP GANGING UP ON WRITERS WHO TRY HARD TO WRITE GOOD STORIES FOR YOU !!!!!!!!!!"
2,"Parts of it were a good idea, I guess...","You have to admit, it was fun watching Jacen and Jaina and Anikan. The fun, stops there. Hethir went to all that trouble to kidnap the kids but, accept for Aniken, he forgets about them. What's up with that?! An how can anything, even if from a different dimension, eat up the force? It's a good book, just not a good Star Wars book."
1,WORST BOOK EVER,Not even worth my time writing about it but to warn other people to stay away. Worst Star Wars book of them all (and there are some pretty bad ones). Find a better use for 10-20 hours of your life.
4,"""May the force be with you""",This book has enlightened my life to my true calling. It is in space. I am now trying to get into the NASA space program. I would like to thank the author of the book as well as George Lucas who came up with the idea of Star Wars over 20 years ago. Thank you all.
2,This book was the worst Star Wars book I've read,The book has the same old story line as just about all the other books I've read. Pricess Leia's children get kidnapped and she must save them. Oh WOW!
1,ARGGGGGGGGG!!,This book is HORRIBLE! The characters acted so strange. I think it would have been better if the author had actually READ other Star Wars books! Stay Away At All Costs!!!
2,This one was REALLY bad.....,"Inside and out. Bad cover art, bad story. Leia's character was well done, and I kinda liked the scenes with Jacen and Jaina, their characters were pretty good throughout most of the book. But Luke was just a whiny brat and jerk, how many times did he bite off Han's head in this book? When was the last time you remember him being even close to doing that? I thought Jedi Masters were supposed to have better control over their negative feelings. The whining was more than usual, and that's pretty bad. The Hethrir and Waru characters were REALLY stupid, I won't even get into them! The storyline stank too. This book was almost as bad as Planet of Twilight and Darksaber..... McIntyre should have stuck to writing Star Trek, she's more suited for it obviously. Is it me or does anyone else think this read too much like a really bad Star Trek novel?"
1,This one was pretty bad...,"Did Vonda even know anything about the SW universe before she wrote this book? The charcters are completely wrong, the bad guys are just plain annoying. And those kids! Please tell me where you have ever heard kids use such stupid psudo-childish language. Their dialog reminded me more of new parents trying to talk ""baby talk"" to their newborn. How come Leia just gets a headache, but Luke is ready to bite everyone's heads off? And for some reason, I just could not picture Waru in my mind. I couldn't visualize what he looked like! And that Leia/Lelia stuff...did that get annoying quick! Not a high point in SW novels, that's for sure! Believe me, you can definatly skip this one, as it has nothing important to the SW universe in it at all"
3,Stupid younger Jedi's what are they thinking?,"I liked the way the older characters (Luke, Leia, Han, etc..) were portrayed in this book but I didn't like the new generation of Jedi. Something about Jacen, Jaina and Anakin bugs the crap out of me. They're just a little too perfect for my taste. I mean Leia and Han would get in big trouble alot of the time so what's wrong with their kids? The kids wear little angel halos over their heads and act almost perfect. Sure they get into a little mischief sometimes. (What kid doesn't?) but they don't get in near enough trouble and danger for my liking."
4,Good book :),"This happen to be the first star wars book I had read. I liked it then, and I still like it now. It wasn't the best, I'll admit, but I still like it!"
1,Worst book I ever read!!!,"I love the Star Wars movies, the Zahn trilogy, Truce at Bakura, The Bacta War, Wraith Squadron,... But there is one major thing that Vonda screwed up, C-3PO!!!!! He was helpful, he never complained, he gave good advice, and he only spoke when asked. Needless to say all the other characters were represented completely from left field, the story was less believable than any of the others in the series. I would have given it a zero if I could."
1,Awful,This book is an embarassment to the Star Wars name. The editors should have scrapped it. A complete lost cause that was the most painful reading experience I have had in a long time!!!
2,The stuff didn't mesh well,This book would have been okay in any other universe but it doesn't mesh in SW. Especially Waru what was Bantam thinking when they allowed this to be published? The characters need work.
1,Baaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaddddddddddddddddd,Terrible plot Forgive my reference But a Adult Video has deeper plots! This was really bad
2,Characterization?,"I give it 2 stars because I read it through to the end...it wasn't bad enough for me to quit reading. The pace was unbearably slow at times, and the latest ""Luke must be a non-factor"" device seems overly contrived. Characterization doesn't seem to follow the obvious development path from the movies through the other novels. Luke turns into a basketcase, Han lets himself get pushed around, and Leia jumps too quickly to run off. This is the first Star Wars book that made me question the quality of the Star Wars novels."
2,Sorry. Maybe next time. . .,"Okay. This book is not, definately not, a good Star Wars book. I wish that I had more nice things to say about it. Vonda whats-her-face gave it a good shot. Unfortunately, maybe she should have tried watching the movie before she started writing. The characters we all know and love are flat. I mean zip. Luke, Mr. Jedi Master, they guy who resisted the Emperor and Vader is a whining crybaby who gets under the influence of some blob. Come on! Leia is flat. The Chief of State is not going to run of like that. Yo, she has a government to run. Were is See- Threepio? Our prissy chatter box spoke, maybe five words in the whole book. Han has a strong will, and would not practicly cheat on Leia. Since when does he let an inkeeper push him around? Hethir or how ever you spell it? Get lost! Waru? Bring me a basin! I'm going to be sick! Overall, stick to Star Trek, Ms. McIntyre."
1,"Good God, what is this THING?","This mockery of the Star Wars universe has to be the biggest waste of money I have ever been sucked into. (Next to the Jedi Academy Trilogy, that is.) These characters are NOT the characters we know and love from Star Wars. And Han and Leia's children... ordinarily, I would have loved a book that lets us get to know Jacen, Jaina and Anakin better. But THIS is ridiculous. The kids were much more interesting in the Corellian Trilogy.The only way I can appreciate this book is if I pretend it was all some big hallucination that Luke had after a visit to Yoda's dark side cave. Don't waste your time or money."
3,A fair attempt.,"Look, you have got to give people some credit. i hate it when people complain about perfectly fine books. Vonda McEntyre is a wonderful author in her own sense, and I would love to see you try to write a SW novel. In fact, my gal Vonda and I would laugh in your pathetic faces. Get a clue! I must confess that this is the second book review that I have written on this book. The first one was before I read those hurtful, stinging, unhuman reviews. You are not worthy of this ""slime"". She has strange concepts, but, bascially, beautiful characters. If it was as bad as you say, would it be published? Nay."
1,The absolute WORST Star Wars book I've ever read,"If I could, I would give this book zero stars. Absolutely the worst drivel I've ever read. None of this book makes any sense. From characters who are out of character, a crappy plot, and half of everything in it not following the Star Wars universe, this book bombs. It was almost like this author just wanted to use the already made up characters in her own little universe, like fanfiction that she got lucky enough to get published. And let me say... I've read better written fanfiction.The biggest thing that irritated me -and actually caused me to put the book down after only getting a quarter of the way through it -was Leia's character. She is NOTHING like Leia. Reading this book is like reading about someone who happens to share a name with our favorite Princess."
4,Good but not the best by far,Over all I like the story of the book but Luke seemed to not really matter to the story at all and Han did not act like he has in pas books or the movies.
3,Luke needs to do more with the Force than the kids.,This was a pretty good book but it would have been a lot better if look would have used the force a lot more than his six year old niece and nephew.
1,Bad,Very slow and very dull. I am telling the truth when I say this book made me fall asleep flat on my face. If I had to describe it in one word: stupid
1,bantha fodder,this one was a lemon and unfortunately i as the reader could not even make lemonade out if this storyline.
1,This book was awful.,"I had high expectations going into the reading of this novel.I was truly let down. It was painful getting through the whole novel.Who are these characters?? Certainly not the Luke, Han and Leia we know from the movie and other Star Wars novels. Luke is just pathetic and paranoid. Vonda N.McIntyre unfortunately has no feel,knowledge or understanding of the Star Wars universe. Please save yourself the time and money and do NOT read this book!!!"
1,Two Thumbs Down,I am a huge Star Wars fan and I've read every book so far to date. This novel is the WORST Star Wars book in existance. It has a very high unbelievability factor and it stretches the Star Wars universe beyond the realm of human comprehension. Two Thumbs Down!!!
1,ugg!!,"I wholeheartedly agree with another reviewer, Craig Stanchfield. The Luke, Leia, Han, and the others were completely out of character. And Luke was an airhead. He's an encredibly powerful Jedi, remember?! His hopping into that thing, temporarily joining the dark side, and all that... I mean, come on!!"
3,OK,"This book is OK. It does have the interesting ""fleshing out"" point, like when Leia and Chewie disguise themselves. I agree with the person who said the author concentrated too much on the appearance rather than the personality and background. And yes, I agree that Waru is sort of Trekkie, and Hethrir is not evil. All in all, not the best read, but important in understanding the Star Wars saga."
2,"Very boring, and definitely different.","This book is a different pace from most Star Wars books. It's not nearly as good as every other books, and there were definitely parts where I just wanted to put it down and start the Black Fleet Crisis. Are you going to take my advice? Probably not, but it's alright. In fact, I encourage you to read it if you truly do like Star Wars, just don't be expecting a great book to come out of it. This book moves as slow as a hutt on a hot day, and has some very lame characters such as Waru (By the way, what the hell is he?) It also makes Luke out to be a very weak and jerky character, and I didn't like that at all. All in all, a definate thumbs down with a couple of exceptions."
3,It was only so-so.,"The storyline itself left me kinda scratching my head. It didn't seem like a Star Wars story. The characterizations were right on, but the story itself was a disappointment"
1,This book made me want to vomit.,"This book was the absolutely worst thing I had ever read. First: the characters. Who are they? These people were not the same people that we have grown to know and love. Han is an drunkard, Luke is a whiny weakling who does not act like a Jedi, Leia seems very false, Chewie is a softie that had to limp around and act meek the whole book. (Strange, because I have read in countless other Star Wars novels that Wookiees have amazing regeneration speed)Leia's children were corny goody-goodies. I didn't want them to get rescued. The dialogue between the kids was positively ludicrous and absurd. At times they were so corny and sugary-sweet I wanted to rip the book to shreds. I hate this novel with passion. I hope Ms. McIntyre has learned a valuable lesson-that it is wise to watch the movies that your novel is based upon."
2,"The story is fine, but is it Star Wars?","The Crystal Star by Vonda N. McIntyre was a fine tale of disguise and things not being quite what they appear. I'm glad it avoided the ""Oh,no! Not ANOTHER Imperial superweapon!"" syndrome these novel tend to get trapped in. I wanted to like this book, but I just can't.The charaterization is simply terrible. Luke doesn't act like Luke. Leia seems to be on the verge of multiple personality disorder.After finishing the book I had a picture in my mind of Ms. McIntyre getting a call from Lucasfilm: ""Would you write a book for us?""""Sure, I'd love to, but I'm too busy... No, wait. I have a book done, but it's not Star Wars. I'll just change the names, add the Force, and no one will know the difference.""Of course, I have not idea if that conversation happened, but considering the end result, I can't help but wonder..."
2,Who are these characters?,"I felt throughout this book that it never grasped the true nature of Luke, Lei and Han. I felt like I was reading about someone else. I don't know, it didn't feel like a Star Wars book at all. I was dissapointed"
4,Could be better,"The first half of the book is pretty boring, but than it gets better. This is my first book of that series: Star Warsso it's hard for me to compare that book to the others of the same series. I heard though from other people, that the other books in that series are much better."
2,Poorly written.,"I read this when I was a kid, and I thought it was great. Ten years later, as a 21 year old college student studying Creative Writing, I disagree with what I thought.I'm going to be blunt: I've read better fanfiction than this.The main problem I had was with the kids--I forgot they were only 5 year old! They acted twice their age; It was completely unrealistic. The author should have took the time to study how children act before writing this book.Secondly, there's just no appeal to the book. It's just a badly-written story. I honestly felt like I was wading through the sludge of some random fanfiction.net story.Maybe this story would have done better if it was targeted towards a younger audience, but then again, I've also read better Young Adult SW books."
1,"Terrible, boring, lame...",I have read almost all of the SW universe novels... this one was so boring and predictable and lame... *YAWN*
1,Find a different SW title,"Man, I wish I would have looked at the reviews before I read this book. The other reviewers are spot on and your time could be better spent reading the X-Wing series or titles by Aaron Alston or Timothy Zahn.This story strays so far from the typical Star Wars books that it feels more like one of the Star TREK books that's wandered too close to the space-time continuum. It tries very hard to be original, but leaves out what makes the Star Wars universe a great place to spend an afternoon."
2,Lack Luster,"I read the book when it first came out... Many years ago. Here and now, as much as I love S.W. and the story lines it creates, I would put the book down and never return to read it. Essentially the story helps build Luke's force abilities and offers fans empty S.W. calories. The only reason I gave the book two stars is because it is S.W.It is not a necessary read for S.W. fans. Skip it, read the Zahn Trilogies and move on."
4,Pretty Good,"I think this book was pretty good, I especially liked the twins Jaina and Jacen. There are four things I didn't like about this book. One, Jaina and Jacen, and Anakin are super smart and they knew more than I do now! They are only five and three and I am much older. Second, I didn't like how Luke was all depressed and weak in this book. Third, I didn't like how everyone was obsessing over how strong Anakin was. Luke and Leia were supposed to be the strongest in the force, because they were the chosen ones. And, lastly I didn't like how the book ended. Other than all those things I thought this book was a great and had a realistic problem instead of crazy far out ones."
1,One of the worst Star Wars books,"This book was a little too weird and didn't have the same ""Star Wars"" aura. I had a hard time believing that Leia would act the way she did, especially blaming and holding a grudge against Chewbacca. Furthermore, I never felt that Luke was real. He seemed a skeleton of himself. The only plus side of this book was a little glimpse into the development of Leia's kids and how they used their powers. But I think that the Corellian Trilogy does a much better job at that(the kids) too."
1,Doesn't deserve to be part of the Star Wars universe.,"This was without a doubt the worst Star Wars book I have read. Vonda McIntyre showed that she had no knowledge whatsoever of the main characters, particularly Luke and Han. She portrayed them badly, giving aspects to their character that a good Star Wars fan would be repulsed by. Buying this book was a waste of my money and the only reason it got one star from me is because that is the lowest I could go."
3,:(,"Unfortunately, this mount would not stay on my girlfriend's wall without falling out of place while the TV is attached. Not really the wall mounts fault though, her room has no studs for me to attach the mount to.Sadly, I had to return it. If my girlfriends wall had a wood stud behind it, this probably would've held well."
5,Grandma Judy,I love this soap dispenser. It looks great on my sink and pumps well...just the right amount. Very pleased with this product!
4,Works Nicely,This is the third soap dispenser I have bought. The previous two cost about 1/2 of this one but since they both broke they have ended up costing me more. The action on this one is much nicer and takes less effort to pump. Not a big deal but it just feels better. It has only been installed for about a week so I can't speak to its longevity but so far I'm impressed.
3,Nice but bottle breaks,"Nice pump unit, but the plastic bottle is weak. The threaded head broke off the bottle. Ordered two replacement bottles(part 1039513 I think) from Kohler for $1.40 each."
1,Very Poorly Made,"The Kohler K-1895 dispenser is very poorly made in China. I had to return the first one because the spout was off by 45. This, obviously, resulted in the soap being dispensed off to the side rather than straight downwards. Its replacement is better but certainly not perfect - the spout is about 5 to 10 off center. I'll probably return this one too and search for a different brand. It's disappointing to see an item of a Kohler so poorly made. It appears to be a brand that I can no longer rely on for its quality."
5,Great Idea and very stylish!,"Using one for soap and one for lotion. Works great, looks great, and no clutter on the counter anymore!"
1,Broke easily,"I bought two of these for my two kitchen sinks. One works fine. The other has been a problem from the beginning. It didn't sit right on the sink and so the pump didn't work well. When my husband went to take it apart and re-do it, the neck snapped off. A waste of money. Can't believe I had to order another one. I ordered a much less expensive one - since this one was made cheaply even though it was fairly expensive for a soap dispenser."
1,Total JUNK,"This is a very expensive soap dispenser and it worked for only 1 year. It will not pump any liquid soap. I have tried everything to fix it and nothing comes out. I am going to try to return it, but expect problems with that. The following number of the one from Lowe's also does not work..Plumb Pak Brushed Nickel Soap or Lotion Dispenser Item #: 196774 | Model #: K612DSBN . I have two of these and they will not pump liquid soap either. The reviews of it at Lowe's are exactly what has happened to me. Do NOT buy either one of these products."
1,"These Balls suck man, BIG TIME YO!","YO, YO who in their right mind would like soccer only the bloody english and the irish. Have any of you ever heard of George Best, the acholic footballer from Northern Ireland well he's not in this game.The controls in this game aRE AWFUL I MEAN ALL YOU do is run abouT with a ball at your feet for 90 minutes. Us americans like exciting games like basketball baseball, now those are a real mans game.Don't get me wrong i dont mind football but to be honest it's really boring, the graphics in the game are blocky and shows that the ps2 is nowhere near as good as the Game Boy Advance now there's a console, don't forget to write to me my address is on the Vice City review, bye all you crazy Yankies"
3,"fun, but not realistic","this game is an arcade version of soccer. it is fun to play if u like arcade style games, but if you want the real thing play winning eleven 6. winning eleven 6 is from europe, and they know a thing or two more about soccer than the US. winning eleven 6 is the best soccer game for ps2, and possibly the best sports game for ps2 period."
3,Not good enough,"FIFA 2003 is the newest version of the Football game from EA Sports.This game does not meet the increasing game quality of the previous versions.Con:Game playability: The new control that they put into place is very hard to play with and still seems to be a work in progress.No practice sessions: Without practice sessions, it is very difficult to be an expert on the new controls. It is very difficult to practice any of the new moves during game play.Low on intensity: Game does not have the intensity of the previous versions. I felt once I started to learn most of the moves and moved up in difficulty, the challenge and enjoyment decreased.Pro:If I have to name one, that would be the shots of the stadiums and team uniforms.I gave this game three stars and do not really recommend spending your money on this game. Rent it instead.Have fun!"
1,Bad game,"This game is very unrealistic. Whenever you try to score, there are only a couple of animations that the game shows you. For example, one usual example is the ball flying high. Another is the keeper deflecting the ball. You keep seeing these same animations over and over. If you want a good game, you should get Winning eleven 6:international"
1,Too easy...,If a sports title is to be great it must offer some kind of challenge. This is not the case with FIFA 2003. I've played this game for three months now and it has become so easy to manipulate offensively that I can score around 10 goals a game on the World Class level. That's even using an MLS team against stronger international competition.Whatever EA did to the game this time around it spoiled it. This game is slap in the face to soccer fans. So many elements that were right with FIFA 2002 are gone just for the sake of better graphics and animations.Headers are all but gone and impossible to execute. There isn't much variance on the passing game and your only chance to win a game is to brutally outscore your opponent because often times 2 or 3 goal leads won't hold up.I really don't get EA. How come you can develop nearly perfect recreations of American gridiron football which is much more complex in theory and can't even come close with the simplistic beautiful game?
2,Good but not good enough.,"I love soccer, I play on a recreational basis. I look forward for every new ps 2 game. FIFA 2002 is fantastic. FIFA 2003 has excellent graphics, the new stadiums, players and the on field reactions are really cool.The controls however ""..."" big time. Soccer is a game of speed and timing. FIFA 2003 controls seem to be still in the dressing room. Reaction time and general control reactions is on sleep mode constantly.FIFA 2002 has more ball and player control features.I strongly recommend that the creation team be or talk to real football players. There should be a collaboration between the graphic creators and the 'control' creators."
2,WHEN IS EA SPORTS GOING TO LISTEN TO THEIR CUSTOMERS?,"BEISDES THE GRAPHICS AND SMOOTH MOTION OF THE PLAYERS THE GAME LEAVES A LOT TO BE DESIRED:A) HEADERS....99% OF THE TIME THE BALL IS HEADED BY YOUROPPONENT.B) PASSING ALONG THE GROUND IS WEAK AND SENDING A THROUGH PASSIS DIFFICULT 'CAUSE THE PLAYERS DO NOT MAKE VERY GOOD RUNS INTO SPACE, EVEN ON COMMAND.C) SENDING A LOB PASS IS RIDICULOUS, YOU CANNOT ADD BACK SPIN TOWEIGH IT DOWN.D) WHEN GIVING COMMAND TO PASS OR SHOOT IT TAKES TOO LONG FOR THEPLAYER TO REACT TO THE COMMAND GIVEN.E) YOUR DEFENSE IS CAUGHT SLEEPING WAY TOO MUCH ON AN OPPONENTSBREAKAWAY.F) YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO DETAIL YOUR ATTACKING AND DEFENSIVESTRATEGIES SUCH AS POSESSION, COUNTER ATTACK OR PRESSURE (ONTHE DEFENSIVE SIDE)G) BALL SPIN....THERE IS NONE.H) TOO MANY TEAMS MISSING THAT SHOULD BE THERE SUCH AS HOLLAND."
3,"Beautiful, but scratches","This ring was so cute, I just had to get it! I wish I hadn't now, because it started to get caught on my clothes and scratched my skin."
5,Old style book but fun to read!,"This is an older book, but great for younger kids! Interesting facts, fun pictures and simple explanations that make it a great addition to any homeschool library. Would recommend purchasing."
5,All generations will love this book,"I loved this book as a child. My children love this book. The illustrations are funny, interesting, and thought provoking. This is a book that children will read and look at again and again."
4,Good explanation of DB2 high availability features,"Having seen Chris talk at several IDUG events, I knew he had a deep knowledge of DB2 and its high availability features. This book highlights that knowledge.The section on logging is the clearest explanation of DB2 logging that I have seen anywhere. I found it especially useful that the parameters that affect logging are covered in detail. His chapter, ""Minimizing Unplanned Outages"" is full of good information about increasing data availability during required maintenance. His detail regarding online schema changes is quite helpful.The chapter on setting up standby database gives much good detail about the various techniques. Sample scripts are included in the chapter to make the DBAs good easier. The chapter on HACMP is very helpful for a DBA trying to understand how HACMP works.My only disappointment with the book is that it came out too early to cover HADR. Having a section on HADR would have made the book complete."
5,From CD Baby Dave Koz's review,"""...a unique sound, a wonderful melodic sense...""""Rocco's already receiving some well-deserved attention for his debut CD (Give Me The Groove) in the form of national radio play. He has a unique sound, a wonderful melodic sense and a great ability to communicate on his instrument. I'm looking forward to hearing where he goes in the future -- it looks bright to me!"" Dave Koz"
5,Are you truly saved?,After reading Mead's work about true conversion I am convinced that this is a must read for all who truly want to examine their own faith. He causes us to look into the deepest parts of our hearts in order to examine what is the motivation for following Christ in our lives. We will be surprised at how easily many are fooling themselves in having a security when indeed they may be lost. A classic that should be read by all believers.
1,How did this make it to print??,The copy and reprint of this book is worse than any I have ever seen. It seems to be poorly scanned???most words are mis-printed typos like an optical scanner was not able to interpret them?Could I have possibly received a mistake publication??
1,You Have Got To Be Kidding Me!,"I cannot believe that General Books of Memphis Tennessee actually charge people for such trashy printing? The ""s"" character is replaced with an ""f"" throughout the entire book, so Christ is spelled Chrift. I am very dissatisfied with this product and would not even give it 1 star if this reveiw allowed it! It is a shame that the publishers ruined such a wonderful work by Matthew Mead. I feel ripped off! Don't buy this product."
2,Okay but could be better,"When it came, it was awful, wrinkled out of shape, and looked like something that had been returned if not worn. I called and it was readily replaced. The second one is okay. It will do for halloween and for the price."
4,Wonderful,"I will not bother to write a different review for each Zatoichi movie. I have all twenty six of his movies and have watched all of them multiple times. Although the believability of a blind swordsman is next to nill, Zatoichi makes it believable because you will fall in love with the character. Shintaro Katsu is one of my all time favorite actors."
3,Pinnacle Express is not on a par with Pinnacle Studio 7,"I purchased Pinnacle Express to transfer my Pinnacle Studio 7 Projects to DVD. Unfortunately, the two products are not well integrated. Express will only import AVI files; thus, the projects that I made in MPEG 2 format had to be redone. Analog input is not supported, only digital via firewire. When scenes were relocted, the final product had hiccups on transition. Editing in express is limited and clunky, particularly when compared to Studio's polished editing features. Also, the maximum movie length is about an hour when including a menu. Other DVD authoring software is capable of up to two hours. On the plus side, the menu creation feature is excellent, with a number of preset menus as well as the opportunity to create custom menus. If you want a program that will capture and burn your DV movies with limited editing, this product will meet your needs. As for me, I will probably purchase Ulead's DVD Workshop after my trial month is up."
2,Frusterating,"In the begining I was having a blast!I loved the game.Then it got boring.The load time was making me impatiant and I coudn't figure out how to do a couple of things.After playing this game for hours everyday this game ended up on the bottom of my stack of games.If you want to play this game I would suggest renting it first and if you are that into it than maybe buying it, but I wouldn't waste my money."
3,Irritating...,"The camera angles, like what the other reviewer said, creates a sort of optical vision thingy that makes it hard for me to move around. I constantly need to repeat the level over and over again, and it started to get real irritating...the loading thing and the bubble sometimes take long, and it really interferes with the game."
5,A Sponge with additude,"I bought this game and I rate it 5 stars.Just because Battle for bikini bottom has better graphics and music, doesn't mean it's not a great game. A great game is the fun of the game, not the graphics. Sheesh! A good game is when you have fun playing it. A bad game without looking at the graphics is like manhole of something. Game boys have bad graphics but they're still fun. Anyway, I love this game. I'd buy it if I were you."
3,Pretty Good,"The Spongebob video game was fun..until my sis(10 years old) beat it the 3rd day after we bought it..some things are challenging, but after you beat them it is really easy, and its not really a game you'd want to play again and again"
2,Theraband red,Theraband is a good product. I've used it in PT and purchased before on line. Blue was not available so I purchased medium red. Upon first use it broke but works okay with doubling. Please make blue available and I will buy.
4,substitute for barbells?,"i was told by my physician not to use heavy weights any more due to lean tissue wasting and systolic blood pressure spikes. high reps with low weights were advocated for lean tissue preservations, so i decided to sell my weights and purchase thera bands. im glad i did. after about two months with these im geting much better muscle definition. i dont have to worry about the bar collar sliding off and busting me in the skull either."
4,not exactly as described but okay,I ordered the $11.18/6 yard option. What arrived is one single band of 6 yards - medium resistance throughout. It's fine and qualified towards free shipping but it was not a range of resistances as described by some reviewers. Perhaps the 50 yard option incorporates this. Don't know.
2,Broke quickly,"These do not hold up well. I was disappointed. It broke within two months. Otherwise, the product does what it is supposed to do, just not for very long."
4,Blue Exercise Band,"The heavy blue exercise band arrived promptly in good condition. It is 6 yards long and stretchy, as advertised. It's just what it should be."
3,Excited,"No complaints regarding the bands. They arrived on time. However, the carrier left the package with a neighbor and I live in an apartment complex. That part of the experience was not good at all. The address was clearly stated on box. What if it had been something more expensive? For that, I have to give 3 stars but the actual product was just as expected."
4,instructor,Started an exercise class and noted people did not come with corrct equipment. Ordered bands by the yard (way cheaper than by each) Everyone was happy. Sad was I tried to go back to Amazon and buy from same company but stronger bands and could not locate.
5,It works!,"A Thera band was given to me as part of an exercise program to restore use and muscle in my arm after a broken shoulder. Simple and even fun to use, it has done its job very well and I continue daily use for maintenance. Recommend reading instructions for the simple care of a Thera band before using it, it will last much longer. And use it according to the instructions of a professional for best results."
4,Great.,This was the first Denison Witmer album I heard; I now have them all. If you like singer-songwriters you should check out all his work.
3,"good monster,plus adjani!","incomprehensible,bizzare and maybe boring,but adjani looks great as a nutcase, and the scene with her and her tentacled lover (very brief) makes it almost worth buying. Carlo Rambaldi did a fine job with the monster,it is one of the wierdest ever!"
2,La Posesion,"I guess this was partly my fault. You see this is pretty much my favorite movie, but seeing how it's out of print, I haven't been able to get a hold of it. I go on Amazon.com and see a plethora of them. Excited I buy this copy. Didn't regard that it said ""La Posesion"". (whatever could just be the release from Spain..) I get it in the mail and put it on first thing. Turns out the whole movie is dubbed in Spanish. I would've hoped there would only be subtitles, but no, there are completely new voices. I'm screwed. Anyone want a dubbed copy of Possession?"
2,hmmm,"This movie, even in its full length, is completely scattered. Adjani is beautiful, yes...so watch her in something else. The characters were underdeveloped, the speech was at times hard to decipher. This story had potential to be something relevant, but the point of it was somehow lost."
1,the worst movie in the whole world,this was the absolute worst movie i have ever see. The audiance who i saw it with was laughing histerically throughout the most dramatic scenes. My skin was crawling the whole movie from the bad acting and nasty story. Dont see this movie or else you'll be sorry.
4,use your imagination,"""Possession"" is unlike any other horror film in that it requires the viewer to draw their own conclusions. To some, this is a frustrating technique. I however, tip my hat to Zulawski for creating something so unique. This film was made in the early 80s when Berlin was divided with the wall. The symbolisim of Berlin at the time (good vs. evil, freedom vs. confinement, faith vs. athiesm) is a constant reminder throughout the film. Isabelle Adjani won both a César and the Cannes award for her role as a tormented woman. Both awards were well deserved, for this was probably the most difficult role she ever had to play. Her moments leading up to the creation of ""the creature"" are absolutely terrifying. Hopefully this is the original European release (127 minutes) and not the butchered atrocity released in the US back in the 80s (80-something minutes)."
2,Quite Disappointing,"This book does not do justice to this series, which is saying quite a bit, given how quickly the show met its demise. First of all, there are many inconsistencies between the book and the series. Facts just don't match up. Second, there is pointless and frequent profanity. Come on, this was a TV show, not an R rated movie. Kids who could handle the series shouldn't go near this book. Third, the editing is lousy. At times, even names were spelled incorrectly.Overall, the story isn't bad. It's entertaining and a quick read. If it was just another book, the rating would be at least a three. But given the way it fails to mesh with the series, I can't give it anything besides a 2."
2,Very Dissappointing,"As a huge fan of the show I was excited to hear that I would finnally be able to get my Dark Angel fix after many years of withdrawl. Sadly, I was let down.First, this is not a good book. Its badly written and the descriptions are very clinical and wooden, it lacks the passion that the show had.Secondly, It doesn't match up with the TV Show. I'm really supposed to believe the OC was in the military, sorry, no way. I also don't buy that Logan knew another x5 before Max. There were other problems too. Maybe I'm getting a little nit-picky here, but OC was from Los Angeles in the series, not Texas. Finnally what was that ridiculous 10-page kiss-up job about what a great movie Titanic was. Sure, it was a great movie, but this is supposed to be about Dark Angel.All in all I was very dissappointed. I still haven't finished the book. And I don't intend to."
3,Not as good as the tv show...,"While it was nice to get the closure that one needs after being left hanging by the TV series which ended abruptly, I have to say that I really like the TV show better. Still, if you were a Dark Angel fan that felt frustrated with the way the show just ended, it does give a little bit of closure, although it does feel a little anti-climatic."
4,Decent for a prequel,"Decent book for a prequel anyway. I enjoyed it. Can't wait to read the other DA books that follow the series finale. I miss the show quite a bit. I read the other reviews and someone said Max's leaving line was ""gotta bounce"" and No, it wasn't. ON THE SHOW Max often said, ""GOTTA BLAZE"". I am 100% positive of that. I've read episode scripts and stuff and it is most definitely BLAZE. So, the writer got it correct. On the show, when Max met Joshua she'd say ""Gotta blaze"", and he picked that up from her because as she was leaving Manticore just before the building blew up, Joshua told her, ""You blaze""."
2,WARNING,"I enjoyed the story of this book very much, but was very disappointed with all the profanity in it. I know the show used swearing a good bit, but this was excessive and foul."
4,OMG!,"OMG! I loved Dark Angel when it was on TV. I'm really upset at Fox, and so are thousands of DA fans when they cancelled the show last May. I especially thought Max, and Logan were the best. But thank gawd for Cedco for the DA Calendar, Artemis Records for the Soundtrack, and now Max Collins for keeping the DA fans still happy. This book is awesome and after I read the first page I knew the rest would be good. Oh, I can't wait for other books on DA and, if there were such a miracle, that DA Fans would all join together and get Fox to put the show back on!"
4,Before the Dawn,"If you're a fan of Dark Angel fan fiction, you'll like this book a lot. Max Allan Collins did a pretty good job of keeping with the overall Dark Angel theme, and the story is pretty good. It can be a little corny, and there are a few editing errors, but if you like Dark Angel I would recommend it."
3,Interesting,This book lets you know what happened before the TV show. It helps set the stage but you need not read it.
2,Honorable intention; weird execution,"Yes, I get symbolism and allegory and the representation of a complacent society letting itself be steamrolled by the Nazis. It was someone's intention to show all of this, but the film is so weird and off-putting that the message tends to get pushed aside by such grotesque elements as these:The horse's head filled with eelsThe nasty soup Oskar is forced to drinkThe graphic sexuality involving Oskar and MariaOskar and Maria sharing a spat-upon treat (this really turned my stomach)Oskar's grandmother being raped while hiding his good-for-nothing arsonist grandfather-to-be under her skirtsOskar and others playing cards (???) while the building they're in is being bombed and invaded by gun-wielding NazisOskar being the world's freakiest-looking kid, with the world's most irritating drum--not to mention his shrieking."
2,Uh-uh,"I honestly thought I'd like this movie, but it was disappointing. Not in the worst way a movie can be, which is to say boring, but in that its shock elements outweighed the theme and message and reduced it to, basically, soft-core child porn. (To the viewer who called it a ""masterpiece in its own right"" -- which I haven't heard in years -- I defy you to define that expression.)"
1,Sick,"""The Tin Drum"" is a disgusting movie that shows the seamier sides of life in pre-war Danzig, Germany. None of the characters in this movie are particularly admirable or likable, save Markus the toy merchant.Even the protagonist Oskar is a debauched character in his own right as evidenced by his frequent sexual trysts with his sixteen-year-old baby sitter. Not to mention having an adulterous affair with his best friend's wife.Some critics have said that ""The Tin Drum"" is a funny film. Having seen this film a few times, I can say there's nothing funny about it. If anything, it's sick and disturbing. This movie really deserves a zero."
1,THE WORST OF THE WORST OF THE WORST!,"I am speachless. I have never seen a strip of film as screwed up as this one. It should have a warning on it. I had never really doubted our freedom of speech before I watched this film, but now I am glad there are laws to protect my sanity. There are only a certain few people that can watch this moovie. I've seen bad and now I've seen worse. If you liked this moovie I would recomend some Pink Floyd: The Wall."
4,Great Film with disclaimer,"This movie was great! It has tons of symbolism: Oskar not growing up reflects the stunted society of Germany after the First World War was until after the Second World War, when Oskar began to grow. Oskar protests social aspects of Germany through his drum and voice. Unfortunately the movie is extremely disturbing at times. If you are unable to forgive some of the harsher scenes in the movie, there are plenty, you will not be able to appreciate the film."
4,The Tin Drum is a good choice for viewing European filmmaking..,The movie is true to Gunther Grass' book on a little boy that refuses to grow up after witnessing the foibles of the adults in his life. A different filmmaking style makes this a compelling choice if you are a fan of European and non-Hollywood methods of moviemaking.
4,Star Wars Episode II - Attack of the Clones,Attack of the Clones is an excellent chapter in the Star Wars Saga. It continues the story of young Anakin Skywalker who has grown to be a very powerful Jedi along side of Obi Wan Kenobi. This movie has some awesome special effects and has a great story. George Lucas is doing an excellent job in telling his story of Star Wars. A really good movie and well worth the price.
3,the beginning of the end,"Well I titled it the beginning of the end just because you can begin to see aniken turning into evil in this movie, for example the killing of all the raiders that stole his mother. Overall, the only real reason I bought this dvd is because I own all the other star wars movie but it was a movie I can only imagine watching once. The graphics were good and overall the story plot wasn't bad, but it was just not my cup of tea. I realize they need to show the love interest between the queen and darth, but the movie just seemed kinda like it was never going to end."
1,Major Let Down,"When I heard people talking about how cool this movie was, I couldn't wait to see it. ...The plot was horrible, the actors were cardboard, and for an action movie, it had about 20 minutes of real action. After Episode 1, I didn't think it could get much worse. This movie cam dangerously close to proving me wrong."
3,Big Disappointment,"This was a big disappointment for both me and my husband. We have been Star Wars fans since the beginning and were very excited about this new release. My husband was fighting to stay awake during most of the movie, and I was wondering if Kevin Costner helped edit this film. The only saving grace was the special effects at the very end of the movie.I wish we had saved our money and gone to see Lord of the Rings at the dollar movies instead of wasting money on what should have been a wait for video movie.This one lacked any of the coolness and heart that Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi have. Interesting that those are the two most popular Star Wars movies and George Lucas had nothing to do with directing them.We definately won't make the same mistake again; we won't see the final prequal in the theater. Definately a wait for video movie."
5,Simply Amazing,"All I can say is that this movie was a complete turn around from Episode I. The computer graphics were beautifully done, the battle scenes were amazing and the plot twisted enough to keep me interested and flowed so that it all made sense.Lucas did a wonderful job of foreshadowing for the original three movies. This movie seemed to run parallel to the design of the original three. I was completely blown away.Regarding the storyline, plot, foreshadowing, characterdevelopment, computer graphics, humor (not the Jar Jarhumor), and everything in between:Beautiful.That is the single best word to describe this film."
5,Loved it,Do not have much to say other then I really enjoyed this movie. Very definatly better then Episoide 1.
3,NOT BAD,"Although I enjoyed the film and is worth watching (especially on the big screen) I have some of the same problems with this film as I did with Menace. Attack of the Clones is inconsistent in tone and quality. George seems to be more concerned with the technical aspects of the movie and less concerned with making characters you get to know and remember. Some scenes, especially ones that try to evoke heavy emotion fall flat on their face. How he chose to reintroduce C-3PO in Menace and Clones is downright hokey. I mean come on! Some of the dialogue was good but alot of it makes you cringe. The soundtrack has less of a role than in 4,5&6. It seems to be more in the background and not very memorable. Visually stunning and a bit better than Menace, Clones does the job but can't hold a candle to the original."
4,Much Better Than The First...,"Better than its predecessor, Anakin is finally played with passion and good 'acting'. Hayden Christiansen is one to watch as the young Darth Vader. The films picks up from Episode I (strangely, ha ha) where the Empire sees the Sith have become more powerful and the clone wars have begun. With the same computer generated style of Episode I, Clones has succeeded in making a very fine looking film. Ewan McGregor is worthy but dismissable as is Natalie Portman (unfortunately two of my favorite actors). Somehow their performances seem on auto pilot as most Star Wars actors have been accused of over the years. Good news, though, Jar Jar Binks has a limited role this time! Although every second he is on screen is still as painful as nails on a chalkboard. With good action sequences and an intriging development in the cause for Anakin's build up of hatred, Clones proves to be worthy of the Star Wars name. ****stars"
1,The Force is not strong with this one...,Tremendous disappointment. My expectations are INCREDIBLY low for Episode 3. Level of adventure in these new installments is null. George has gone mad with power. He's basically shattered the essence and grace of the original films. A once VERY well-respected man has become the village idiot... oh how tragic.
1,yawn....,"I was somewhat disapointed with the first one (or is it the fourth??). But Star Wars - Episode II is even worst... It simply looks like a movie setting up another later movie... But then again that is what I thought of the first one. I got this movie along with another one (the time machine 2002). And let me be honest to tell you that the time machine was 500% better than Star Wars episode 2. I basically wasted almost two hours watching a few good special effects :-(The ""original"" Star wars (episode 4 to 6) were way way beyond their ""newer"" brethrens...Rent it to see some special effects, but not much else."
1,Let's review some fatcs:,"1. This is not a very good movie.2. Biased people write in to give it five stars.3. Lucas HAS lost his touch.4. Unless the next movie is absolutely spectacular, this trilogy will be seen as a horrific failure of a once great series."
1,I agree with the Wrath of Khan reviewer!,"I'm no big fan of William Shatner, but at least he can ACT! The sorry lot of actors in this flick may have given this series a final fatal blow. I know no one who is looking forward to the next installment"
3,Better than Episode 1...,"...but still worlds behind the original Star Wars Trilogy. In my opinion, many of the major players, Anakin in particular, desperately need acting lessons. The plot is more engaging than the first, and it can provide a needed sci-fi fix for you. However, don't expect to be blown away with witty repartee, or deep characters. The special effects are too heavy-handed with CG graphics, but you have the impressive opportunity to finally see the Jedi council fight. It's worth watching once or twice, if you like science fiction or the original trilogy."
5,Anakin rocks!,"I loved this one better than the first,because of course,Anakin is bigger and his knowledge of the Force is more advanced.I loved Christopher Lee's part as Count Dooku,and how he takes on both Obi-Wan and Anakin and somehow beats them both.There's a better storyline and plot,the relationship between Anakin and Padme grows stronger,and the danger grows larger.If you've watched the other Star Wars films,you'll love this one."
2,Cringeworthy,"The SFX in the digitally-projected version look much better,but the horrendous dialogue, thrown-together plot and lousy acting (particularly between the two love birds) ruin the film.Sam Jackson, Christopher Lee and the final battle sequence are the only saving graces."
1,a disappointment,"Wooden acting by even some of the best actors in the business, a horrible plot, a laughable romance. Special effects were nice...."
4,Pretty good!,"I liked Episode II. I found it to be richer and more interesting than Episode I, although not as good as Episode III. You need to see all six of them, though--almost nothing better!!!"
1,"I despise this ""movie""","Deeply offended, am I, at the 5 star reviews that are clearly placed to artificially elevate this movie's rating. How dare you people!!"
4,LOVE IT,"I have seen this movie 3 times and i love it! I really think it is a ton better than Episode one, BUT it still doesn't nearly compare with all the older episodes! I did find the acting and dialouge poorly done, but the special effects and romance scenes (which i love) help the movie stand firmly! I can't wait to buy the DVD!"
1,Swarmy,"This atrocity of marketing hurts my delicate sensibilities. I prefer real acting, a la ""the English Patient."" OOH that Ralph Fiennes!"
1,The worst star wars EVER!!!!!!!!!,"Well to open this review I have to say that no matter how good the action was it still didn't save this movie. This film continues the battle beetween the jedi and the sith. The movie also covers the origins of the clone army and such,including Anikans turn to the dark side. Now to tell you the dialouge in this film is sooo bad you can hardly bear to listen to it! Further more I cannot understand how George Lucas managed to make the old trilogy so good and stunk-up this new one?This movie is rated PG for suatained sequinces of sci-fi action\violence. and it deserved the rating. Though they could have made it PG-13! The good thing about it though is there is no languge and only some brief kissing beetween Anikan and Padma.Overall score: The worst star wars EVER!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Not a movie,"This isn't a movie, it's a 2-hour long toy commercial. Characters, settings and costumes are introduced and abandoned at a frenzied pace; not to tell a coherent story, but to sell more action figures,The scene where they're dodging machinery in the droid factory was obviously just included to be a screen in a video game - and the Donkey Kong reference is clear."
3,It's Fine,"This movie in my view a good movie. Better plot than the Phatom menace and has got the same action. It sets up a better understading and plot for the next movie and the three original movies. However, the love story between Anakin and Padma was over-rated and too much. I got kinda sick of it, not only that it always showed how much they were suffering especially Anakin. And I never understood how Count Dooko came in play into star wars. Hopefully this review was helpful to you."
3,A Historical Look Back...Thats About It,"The acting was bad, the sound effects were lame, and the movie was boring...until the end. I have to say the plot was cool. Emperor Palpitine as he sets up this war to weaken the republic as Darth Sidious and the Supreme Chansler w/ a clone army. The special effects makes the past look futuristic and the future (the original trilogy) look like the past. The only reason I liked it was the fact that it was a flashback of the star wars past."
5,Yoda's the Man,"This one's so much better than EP1. Again, the minor irritation is the nincompoop Jar Jar Binks. I don't know why they kept this bad joke. He is an awfully lame comic relief character. I was more enthralled by Master Yoda, as the movie delves more into this interesting character as he teaches the very young Jedi children. He's also in numerous scenes as the sort of main general of the old republic fighting force. Yoda's fight scene with the politician was spectacular. It should have been extended 1 or 2 minutes more. After seeing this movie, you'll have gained a more healthier respect for Yoda."
1,What A HUGE Disappointment,"An incredibly good story is absolutley killed by bad dialouge among other promises that were not obtained. A friend of mine told me the film reel would be flawless because we went to a midnight showing and it was horrible. I thought it was going to melt on the reel. The crowd who attended this midnight showing pretty muched laughed out loud every single time anakin and padme did anything romantic....I felt embarassed for all the people involved with this movie. I was also told ...that we would see lots of Jedi die in this movie.....we see one, and we dont even know or care about the one who does die. this is by far the worst movie on the installment and thats saying a lot with Phantom menace out there to compare it too. Here's hoping (praying) that Lucas gives the reigns of the movie to someone else for the final movie...someone who can actually DIRECT."
1,Is this the worst movie ever made?,Has the adult film industry ever made a movie with less plot than this one? With worse dialogue? With worse acting?
1,Attack of the Clowns,"This movie was just plain bad. I thought that the acting was come of the worst acting I've seen in awhile. After watching some of the special features on the DVD, I know why the acting is bad... it's because the voices are DUBBED.Don't buy or even watch this movie. Stick to the original Star Wars movies."
4,"Good Action, Intriguing Story, I wish someone could act","The movie is a step-up from the Phantom Menace. The action is excellent, the special effects sweet and the full story begins to come together. But could someone please help Mr. Lucas when directing actors. Annakin is stiff and distant. The dialogue is weak and almost forced at times in the movie. The CGI characters in the movie actualy had better lines and warmth than the humans. Halfway through the movie I found myself rolling my eyes every time they cut to the ""love story"". But thank goodness I don't go to a Star Wars film for that."
2,"Obi-wan, the detective","Movie makes no sense, dominated by poor story-telling, flashy effects. You have to love the idea that in the future, combat will be dominated by humans who have reflexes quick enough to dodge laser beams! Great stuff ( not ). Lucas continues to milk his SW franchise, with ever worsening results. Portman is smashing to look at, as always. McGregor does a great job. The best parts of the movie are at the clone factory, the assembly line dodging, and finally, the Coliseum fight.Lucas should have stopped with SW1 in 1977----not one SW feature after that has been worth the bother."
5,Lucas and ILM do it again.,"Yet another fantastic episode in the Star Wars Saga!!! True to his (Lucas) form, he continues to dazzle audiences across the globe. This great saga will live on, beyond the end of time."
3,Not your...well....it isn't the original trilogy,"I wanted to love this movie. It was entertaining. But new films have lost the spirit and wonder of the first movies. The force is no longer something mystical and mysterious...it is something boiled down to science. This movie is more like a video game. I guess that is what most young audiences want today, more game, less character developement. I couldn't fall in love or care for any of these characters."
2,HARDWARE WARS,"If you ever saw HARDWARE WARS then you know what I mean when I say: ""You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll kiss eight bucks goodbye!"" This had to be a spoof. This movie was like one long Saturday Night Live skit with good special effects...Let me know when the real Episode II comes out."
5,Watch it before you review it,"This is for Imakikuass review, don't down the movie because you have never seen it. You are stupid to review it before you watch it."
1,Painful,Not quite as bad as sitting in the dentist office but close. Nothing personal but it was painful watching Hayden Christensen portray Anakin Skywalker. Each scene involving Anakin contained cliches so bad I wanted to vomit on the floor.
1,"Madonna sweeps Razzies, Lucas spared embarassment","At least aotc did not win ""worst film of the year."""
2,Makes EPISODE 1 look like a classic,"Slow, tedious prequel to Lucas's megahit saga, has young Anakin traveling back to Naboo with Senator Amidala as her protector while Obi-Wan pursues the bloodthirsty bounty hunter Jango Fett, and stumbles across a seemingly endless army of clones in the process. Like its predecessor THE PHANTOM MENACE, this contains enough exhausting visual effects to sink a boat, but they don't pack any of the punch they should. This, along with laughable politics, cardboard-thin characters, ridiculous sexual chemistry between the two leads and a monotonous battle at the end make this pitiful instalment easily the worst of the entire saga yet. EPISODE 1 actually looks good by comparison. One of the first films to be shot of HD Video, but who cares?"
1,"I would have given it no stars, but they don't let you.","I'm sorry, but this movie is just dull, I don't get the point of it, I know it's supposed to be backstory, but why, why would I care why and how Darth Vader is created, he is what he is in the only three Star Wars movies there are. I still think the jokes made that George Lucas writes these Prequels as he goes is true, and the simple fact that he is actually going to end up having to redo parts of the original three movies is irritating to say the least. I say it's all about money plain and simple. Did anyone actually care about the storm troopers? Why would you, and come to think of it, why would they even need officers in a clone army, it just didn't make sense and the story dragged and dragged. One other thing, one second Yoda is floating, another he is hobbeling like an old man, next he is bouncing off the walls like a 10 year old on speed and pcp, the power of the force is sure a magic thing. A magical annoyance."
2,This movie [is bad]!,"This movie is so sappy I want to throw up. It was so dumb when Yoda fought bent lightsaber-boy. I'm sure, his walking around with this stick then his jumping around the place. It [is bad]. Read my lips, DON'T BUY THIS MOVIE!!!!!! If you do you'll be sorry."
1,Unwatchable,This movie is just plain unwatchable. It has nothing going for it. It's two hours of video game-like action sequences in cringe-worthy dialoge. The only thing that saves this movie is the Star Wars IP.Don't watch it. You're average fan film has better quality.
1,Why? Why? WHY?,"Since 1977 I had heard that George was going to make 9 SW movies. Then, after Jedi, he trimmed it down to 6. After the success of the first 3 SW movies he should've just walked away and been happy. (Can I get a witness?) George, you have oodles and oodles of cash! You never needed to do this to us! We were happy with the first 3! Well, I can take solace in the fact that I have said, since 1983, that he should NEVER make anymore SW movies. Why? Because you can't top the first 3 on ANY level. You can't top the actors, scripts, direction, villians, and the legend of the first 3!"
1,The worst movie I've seen,This movie was so stupid I've seen better when I went to see Cast Away. I mean if you've seen that movie you would get board and I think I could make a better movie than this.
2,just another movie,"I usually take a little time to discuss the movie i've just watched with my friends when we get out of the theater. So after Episode 2 I tried to do the same, and for a moment I couldn't remember what movie i've just seen. Its just other SF action movie; big explosions, bad acting, CG graphics... they all become one big blur in my mind and no name jumps out at me. oh well, no big loss.Its worth a rental if you want to test you newly bought home theater system."
2,poor,"Special Effects should be used to support an already good story/screenplay and Lucas doesn't have that to begin with. He is a horrible scriptwriter because he has no realistic sense of dialogue. In addition to this, he is not a great director. The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi were both far superior to the original and were not directed by Lucas. Because of his inability to direct, the romantic tension between Christiansen and Portman is essentially non-existent and the overall emotion in the film is about on par with the Star Wars Holiday Special. Good special effects don't make a good movie. Lucas tries to do too much himself and in the end the success of the movie is carried by the success of its predecessors and its good, but overused, special effects."
5,Simply Amazing!,What can I say it's freaking Star Wars man it is so good buy it now stop reading and go buy!!!
3,Gonna have to be good to make up for the last one,"The Phantom Menace seemed more to me like they were having too much fun with special effects and were lost in what to do with the story-line. I can only hope Geroge Lucas can bring back the life to this saga and not drop it down the [drain] like he almost did before. This one appears to be more like a love story, but it may get dark/grim enough for my liking. Of coarse the twist in the end is obvious, unlike Darth Vader being Luke's father in the 5th."
1,I have seen the error of my ways,I was wrong about this movie. All the good reviews I wrote were written under a bad influence. I was the one who lost the truth. I hate this movie because it is bad. The romance between the characters does not explore the concept of human love. George is a bad director!! Whoever says Hayden Christion is a good actor I challenge them to a boxing match. George Lucas must be stopped!! Worst movie since Hope Floats!!!
3,"Getting Closer, George!","If Episode One was cold, Episode Two is lukewarm.I did not believe the ""forbidden love"" element at all. There seemed to be no actual resistance on the part of the lovers...and there is a larger problem:WHY WASNT ANAKIN KICKED OUT EARLIER?some people, it seems just arent meant to be jedi. I dont want to see someone who already has evil in him fall... I want to see the noblest of them fall from grace, THAT is tragedy.IN any case... it was better than Episode One, but i felt it still was not on par with the originals."
4,Not That Bad,"After watching The Phantom Menace and now Attack Of The Clones I was disappointed until I realized something very important -- I am not 8 years old anymore. These movies are made for the imagination of children. Let's face it, most of us have grown up.When I watch the original trilogy now I see it as being cheesy, poorly written but very entertaining. I didn't think that as a child just as I am sure children seeing these movies don't look at it critically. To appreciate the Star Wars movies one must not be so cynical and look at through the eyes of a child.I like Attack Of The Clones. The acting is cheesy, the script poor, but the effects are amazing and it's a Star Wars movie."
2,Strike Two!,"Some movies don't need to have profound storylines or sharp endings or twists. Some movies just need great action sequences and great visual effects. The Matrix gave us both of these, but Episode II neither. I was extremely excited when I heard about the special high definition cameras Lucas was going to use. But what is the use if the entire background is digital and looks phonier than a toupee. Billion dollar cameras to film pure (beep)! But the storyline is worse, Lucas should have created a digital Anakin, at least he would have had a better actor. Touché for Padme. I felt robbed after watching this movie. I thought this would be redemption for Lucas after Episode I, but STRIKE TWO! Let's just hope he doesn't go down swinging with Episode 3"
2,2 stars for yoda,Yoda's fight scene is worth the price of admission. The rest of this movie is nearly complete dreck.
3,Maybe Episode III will make up for II,"Great story, Great special effects, but all were badly executed from the Script to the Direction. It could have been one of the best in the saga."
3,3 stars for special effects,"I love Star Wars and no doubt I'll see the episode III.I hope Lucas hires some WRITERS for God's sake, his dialogue can be painful at times--Anakin and Padme's scenes can be real groaners. The arena scenes are a highlight."
3,"Star Wars II, Attack of the Clones","Having seen the real first three movies when they first came out (Star Wars, Empire Strikes Back, and Return of the Jedi), I just can't like Episodes I, II, and III as much. They are good for providing background information but they're not so suspenseful or exciting. Episode II has enough fighting and things blowing up to make it interesting to my two sons, but Anakin is not such a likable character, Obi Wan Kenobe in this movie is not nearly as well acted as it was in the other movies, and Anakin's love interest doesn't seem convincing to me. But unfortunately, on the whole this movie has to be seen by Star Wars fans just BECAUSE."
5,Star Wars is back...,"I enjoyed this movie alot more than the Phantom Menace. Even the much maligned love scenes were decent. This movie had the feel of the original Star Wars movies. Especially the battles between Obiwan and Jango Fett. After watching this one, I can't wait for Episode III."
1,NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"My reaction to seeing this movie was similar to Luke's when he found out Darth Vadar was his father. In short, this movie was the absolute worst Star Wars movie for several reasons. First, the acting and actors were stiff and boring. Second, as any avid Star Wars fan knows, there were several mistakes in the movie condradicting what was clearly established previously. Third, not only is this movie boring and unexciting (except for the last battle) but it tries to make big heroes out of boring characters. I hope Episode III will be better, but I sincerely, SINCERELY doubt it."
5,So many movie directors with blasting reviews,"If you haven't seen this movie, do yourself a favor, GO IN WITH NO EXPECTATIONS! This is not a film to be critiqued or to be taken apart bit by bit for analysis. I have heard critics of the best three films from the last year say the same things, but only because they said, ""I was expecting this,..."" or ""I was disappointed because it wasn't the way I was expecting...."". Lord of the Rings, Spiderman, and Episode II were great films which were extremely entertaining, just as long as you didn't think that Lucas, etc, owed you something with the movie. One thing to say, if they weren't great movies, no one would watch them as much as they did. You wanna see a movie with no plot and overdone special effects, go see Resident Evil. Only movie I have ever walked out on.......it was so bad I stayed and saw Ice Age instead......."
5,I really enjoyed this movie,"I grew up watching Star Wars and in all six movies you get your fill of lightsaber battles. Hayden Christensen does an excellent job as Anakin Skywalker, who would eventually become Darth Vader. there is alot of stunt work in this movie and you will see young Boba Fett, before he was a bounty hunter. I wonder when Lucas Films is going to come out with Episode 7, like they promised in the early 90's. all in all it's a great movie series."
1,Yoda not tha man!,"and that scene was absolutely ridiculous. Some people in the theater cheered, those over the age of 11 laughed. It was the final nail in the coffin!"
5,Based on the trailor and my anticipations.,"I am excited about the new film, but no one has actually seen it. What will happen in Episode II: Attack of the Clones and Episode III was eluded to by Ben Kenobi to Luke Skywalker in the first movie (Episdoe IV) right before Luke receives his father's lightsabor. The trailor (coming attractions) that I saw before Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter looked like a romantic love story or a date movie. Kind of disappointing to a die hard fan like myself. I realize that they have to attract the kind of crowd who may have no interest in sci-fi, fantasy, or the Star Wars saga so I guess I could forgive Lucasfilm. But the few action they did show looks cool. The story told to us by Obi Wan back in 1977 promises an exciting ride for this newest Star Wars movie. I am sure there will be a lot of surprises not revealed to anyone yet. May the Force be with you!"
1,episode 2 was number 2,"If you couldn't wait to see episode 2, you will unfortunately be disapointed. George Lucas has unfortunately disapointed us with the second installment of the star wars saga. Granted the CGI in episode 2 is great, Arnold Schwartzeneger's acting could have made its way out of this paper bag better. The best acting and emotion in this movie, came from the CGI Yoda! If you are going to spend [money] on a movie, go and see Spiderman, episode 2 can wait for video."
2,worst star wars ever!,"liked it at first then hated it!worst acting!i mean im sure its all george lucas's fault!even christopher lee was stinky poo at acting!!i mean the love story is so retarded!!just""annie""and ""sand gets everywhere""why!why!this is like some dumb tv show!and the speciel effects stink!!!worst!omg!totally bad!empire strikes back and revenge of the sith own this"
3,George Needs Help with writing Romantic Scenes!!,"My question is: Did George Lucas write the romantic story in this movie? Because if that's his idea of love developing-YIKES!!How can we possibly be convinced that Anakin is in love with Padme with such wooden acting by Hayden Christiansen? I'll try and believe that it's bad writing and direction and try and give Hayden a break. But boy, it better get better in Episode 3 or no one is going to believe this love story!!!If Anakin is suppose to burn with love and passion for the Senator then, good grief, give the boy some facial expressions!!!Where's the struggle of the love he has for Padme and the pull of the Dark Side?!! It's really not believable here.Is George Lucas' real love life this wooden???"
3,I Expected More...,"I was excited to see the next episode of the series after the first episode. The first actually did pretty well....But this movie was terrible. Okay, first of all Hayden Christensen (Anakin) is an all around bad actor! The story went no where, it just kept dragging and dragging. I liked that they introduced some characters from episodes 4, 5, & 6 and the action was pretty cool, but the story went no where! Like I said, it just dragged on...Same old thing over and over. I liked it enough to buy it though...The action was good and there was a good selection of music, I liked some of the actors but not Hayden Christensen...The special effects and scenary was great. And the battle with Yoda (Frank Oz) and Count Dooku (Christopher Lee) made me laugh. I give this movie a 3.4, .1 was because it made a good frisbee. ^_^"
5,Much Better than I thought it would be!,"I had heard lots of bad things about Star Wars Episode II Attack of the Clones, so I was not sure what to expect. I was really surprised how good it was. In Episode II,there is alot of ground to cover, Anakin and Padme falling in love, Anakin starts to turn to the dark side, the rise of the clones and the beginning of the end for the jedi. George Lucas is able to all of these things and not short change any of the story lines. The second disc has a lot extra features including deleted scenes, trailers, and more. Overall, Star Wars Episode II Attack of the Clones is well the money!"
1,Send in the Clones!,"Where to start about how bad this movie was? Well, combining the inane dialog, clunky plot, unconvincing special effects, the acting on the level of a high-school play, and the cut-and-paste aliens, this was my reaction: I could buy it as a made-for-TV Star Wars ripoff, but how did it ever get into theaters? Just goes to show what a famous franchise can pull off.In short, don't even rent it!"
1,not quite as bad as episode I,"Who's the kid that plays Anakin? What kind of favors did he, or his mother, have to do to get the gig?! He is one of the worst actors, and I use the term lightly, I've ever witnessed!!!Boring, but at least it got rid of the racial stereotypes that was soooo offensive in episode I. For that alone I give this a solid 1 star. I would give #I no stars if I could!"
1,boring,I was a Star Wars fan when I was child but these prequels are a waste of money.I yawned quite a few times thoughout the screening.
1,UH NO!,"What a disgrace. So much talent, money, and motivation put into this movie and the result::: YAWN.Oh well, better luck next time. Oh...there is another one? Hmmm...let me camp out for 5 months to get in line, oh, there is no line..Oh, this movie also disapoints.."
1,egads,"This clearly does not even rate in the top 30 movies of the past five years. My disapointment soaring, I returned the dvd for store credit.I am no longer waiting in line for any Lucas material. I will rent the next one."
1,"really, no really bad","This movie was slightly more exciting than watching paint dry, but not by much. My friend Kathy said she fell asleep half-way through the movie, but she may have been tired, I don't know. She may be a narcolept"
1,Suckage,"George Lucas needs a ""no"" man. He needs someone that does not come up with ideas of his own, he just shakes his head in the negative to Lucas's ideas until good things happen on screen. After his no man he needs writers and directors.This effort does nothing to redeem himself from the horrible 1st installment of this prequels. Boo on you Lucas for ruining a fantastic franchise. Its a shame they still make money on these.BOO ON YOU LUCAS."
2,Bleh....,"Much better then Episode 1: The Phantom Menace, but not anywhere close to the original trilogy in class and character. More stale acting and wooden performances all around, followed up with a bunch of computer graphics. George Lucas is out of gas."
1,I am underwhelmed,"What do people think when a movie gets so much money thrown at it, people want to love it, [people] wait in line for tickets,then it comes out as a big, overbloated mediocre film? I love the original Star Wars trilogy. If the 2 recent ones had come out first, the plug would have been pulled on this series."
2,Once again...,"...a movie so terrible ""Santa Claus himself would vomit with rage."" No, that's not completely true, maybe harsh even. Episode 2 was again a marvel for film special effects, but sometimes even those felt overplayed. OK, I admit, the first time I saw it (as appalled as I was by the fake emotions and horrible directing from Lucas) the last 20 or so minutes kept me excited and wanting more, but Lucas just really has to pass the torch... which he isn't doing. As much of a chance as Episode III has of being a great movie, I thought that Episode II had just as much a chance over 1. Sure, it was better, but not by much. Really people, look inside yourself and ask whether you can really say that you felt as good coming out of this movie as you did when you came out of A New Hope and beyond. If you can, then happy disillusionment to you. All in all, I for one am glad I can take solace in the fact that everything that went wrong in the Star Wars universe can be blamed souly on Jar-Jar Binks."
2,At least Episode III will be the last one...,"This is a horrible movie. The acting is wooden, the dialogue is pathetic and contrived, and the plot is almost non-existant. Only the scenes with Anakin and the Sand People and the final Jedi battle come close to capturing the spirit of the original 3 films. The rest of it is garbage.Apparently George Lucas thought that he could distract us all from the fact that he made an extended video game cut scene instead of a movie by filming the entire thing in front of a blue screen and filling the movie with CGI. Maybe he thought that we'd have to like it, just because it carried the Star Wars brand label. Maybe he just didn't care because he knew he'd be raking in about $1 billion. In any case, he continues to ruin the original three movies with these train wrecks. Well, he was right, and we're all gonna hate ourselves when we can't stop ourselves from seeing his final installation, titled ""Star Wars: Episode III: Just Give Me Your Money""."
1,Horrible!!,This was about the worst movie I ever saw. I kept on looking at my watch to see if it was over yet!
1,Lost to LOTR:TTT for special effects,"Oh well, no oscar. Is anyone surprised? I think we were all disapointed in this latest Lucas misadventure. How he took this once great trilogy down to such low depths boggles the mind."
2,WILL EVERYTHING BE TIED UP IN THE END?,"I've been a big STAR WARS fan since it first came out in 1978. It was the ultimate adventure with a good versues evil premise.I was very disappointed when I saw The Phantom Menace. The film was too focused on Anakin Skywalker, and it lowered its standards. I anxiously waited with anticipation for Attack Of The Clones, and aside from it being a little better, there were still alot of flaws in the film. The worst was the romance. It totally ruined the pace in the film, and talk about rehashing of certain scenes. Haven't I seen that scene with the starship weaving through th easteroids before? Han Solo did it in the Empire Strikes Back and the ending was way too fast. I didn't know what had transpired until I read the book. And again I'm reminded of The Empire Strikes Back. The ending was the same. I just hope that with the third (and final film) that Mr. Lucas is able to tie it up nicely."
5,what is episode 3 going to be like,"what can you say about episode 2 special effects fantastic, many jedi lightsaber battles, including the awasome yoda lightsaber duel, the only flaw is the romantic story, but the action makes up for it, this dvd is loaded with extras, and any true starwars fan will add this to their dvd collection episode 2 makes you first for more, yet not till 2005"
4,Star Wars episode II:attack of the clones,"I ' ve never written a review for anything before. I love Episode II so much though, that I feel I must say something. Well first of all I think Star Wars episode II is the best one yet. My favorite things about it are tht Christopher Lee is in it. He is my favorite actor. And the intire Kamino scene. I strongly sugest that the people who havn't seen it should."
5,one of the best movies i've ever seen,"Star Wars II - Attack of the Clones was, by far, one of the best movies I've ever seen. I enjoyed both the action parts and the romantic parts, I think both were acted out quite well. For those who think that I am simply ""following the crowd"", taking everyone's opinion and giving this such a high rating because I love the trilogy, you're wrong. I had NEVER seen the trilogy before, and I even own them - I just never cared to see them. Then a friend of mine, who is an avid Star Wars fan, told me I should go see episode II, and I finally did, figuring that it's summer, I have nothing better to do, might as well. I loved the movie so much I came home and promptly watched the entire triology straight."
5,If this movie doesn't impress you what does?,"A lot of people, who must be really horrible unfun people to be around in real life hate this movie, Ep1 and the special editions. I really feel sorry for you people, the star wars movies make me feel good to be alive and spark my imagination and make me want to create. Virtualy every frame of this movie is so crammed with cool stuff I never tire of looking at it. The two battles at the end are things I've dreamed about seeing on the screen all my life. I loved the original movies, I had a star wars themed birthday parties for my 4,5 and 6 birthday, but I don't care about nostalgia, episodes 1 and 2 blow them away. Plus I've never wanted to make movies before, but seeing these movies has made me buy a camera and start storyboarding my ideas.So to all you reviewers who rip on this movie, I feel sorry for you, it makes me happy and inspires me. If this movie doesn't impress you, what does? Shakespeare in Love? Denzel's latest? Man, I feel sorry for you."
1,I wanted to like it...but no go...,"I have read the negative reivews here, but I NEEDED to write one... especially after seeing both LOTR'sBut somewhere along the road George Lucas LOST HEART... this movie just felt robotic, poorly acted all around, poorly written... just not a real effort to me... I was actually amazed by the beauty of some of the scenes... specially effects wise.... but really this movie is just a multi-million dollar experiment by Lucas in his and Industrial Light and Sound's technical skills... and really in this day and age is that really something to rest on?I dont expect much from the third movie which will probly come out in 5 years.... and i'll probly watch... but Lucas should NOT have even started a half-butt job in the first place....the force is DEAD... for me the TRUE star wars saga ended with JEDI... with a whimper yes but thats that....... long live Lord of the Rings!!!!!! this is the movie Lucas wishes he could write..."
1,"Worse than the first, and i thought that wasn't possible!","Horrible movie, i can't believe i was dumb enough to waste good money watching it; considering how bad the first one was. The only good part was the part where Yoda kicked ass, but one can easily wait for it to come out on cable to see that! Don't waste your money unless your a star wars nut. I definintly won't be seeing the third movie."
3,So so movie,"This movie was pretty good, and on my scale I rated it a 3. What's good: the actor that plays Anakin is pretty good about portraying a young Jedi apprentice who is struggling with becoming an accomplished Jedi and his love for Padme. Another good thing- Yoda's battle at the end is the show stealing highlight.What's okay: now that Padme is a senator, does that mean she can wear all of those suggestive clothes? There is too much flirtation between Anakin and Padme.Over all, this is a good action movie and full of special effects and has a lot more Jedi in it."
4,Not Bad At All,Well after watching star wars episode 2 i was thinking to myself what a piece of [gargage] but then i watched it again and i realized wow this has a really good story i loved it so much i bought it on dvd now u may say lucas doesnt have it in him anymore well i think he does these new movies are twice as good as the originalsonly thing i didnt like about episode 2 was that it took long and that obie wan kenobie like was really slow unlike episode 1but if you a star wars fan then u will most likely enjoy this film
5,STAR WARS EPISODE II (FULL SCREEN),If your a fan of star wars like me you will want to get this movie. nuff said!
4,Anikan is going nuts!!,"Great, great movie.(even Yoda) Impressive mind blowing visual effects with a decent story....some of the romantic dialoguescould use a little work, ok make that alot of work."
3,Another disappointing sequel,"Perhaps the problem is that I was a teenager when the original Star Wars was released. I was enthralled with the technology and the story. The Empire Strikes Back was one of my first ""date"" movies, so it has even more nostalgia attached to it. By the time The Revenge of the Jedi was released, I had grown up a bit and was not unhappy to let the series go.I was pleased when Mr. Lucas decided to do this first trilogy. I thought that the background for the earlier movies would be satisfying. I was wrong. There is almost no meat to these movies, no familiar stars, and the technology can be seen in any theatre in many different movies. On one hand, I could not skip these movies because of my earlier attachment to the series. However, unlike the first three, I won't buy this trilogy."
3,No Chemistry,"The two main characters Amidala and Anakin have no chemistry. And its obvious that Christopher Haydn doesnt know how to act properly in the love scenes most of the time he is acting like a stalker/rapist its hard to watch. And whats with them falling in love all of a sudden, Amidala rejects him at first, telling him rightfully hes making her feel creepy (made me feel creepy too) and then all of a sudden she swoons for him. There should of been more action and less of the poorly written love story. George Lucas must be getting senile, I dont know."
3,"DVD Good, Movie not so good","George Lucas seems to have forgotten that a story should drive a movie forward, not the special effects. This is what has plagued the Star Wars prequels, and Episode II is no exception. The movie is mediocre at best. The DVD however, is quite well done. There are plenty of extras included, including behind the scenes materials, and deleted scenes. The transfer is high quality, thanks to the all-digial production (Lucas never shot the movie on celluloid, but rather with digital cameras onto a computer, so he could do the SFX better). The changing menu sceme (it shows different backgrounds every time you put the movie in) is another unique trick."
3,"could have...no, SHOULD have been better","Bad acting, bad dialogue, really bad chemistry between the star-crossed Padme and Anakin...barely worth watching if not for the absolutely stunning visuals (except Yoda. should've stuck with the muppet, George). Better than Episode I, but we fans expect more."
3,Yoda was the best thing about this movie,"Look at the title. It was real boring, but I was laughing so hard at the yoda sequence. Also, Christopher Lee was great. Everyone else was pretty bad, especially the actor of Anakin. He had such bad lines (none of the lines were memorable, but he defineataly had the worst lines). As he states so BORINGLY, WITHOUT EXPRESSION, ""Just being around her again is entoxicating."" Enough to make you fall asleep at that. But it wasn't a BAD movie, it just wasn't a GOOD movie."
1,Question,Is another DVD release coming out? I guess I really could use another copy as a paper weight. Thanks in advance.
1,George Lucas Has Lost His Mind.,"This movie was a very big let down. George Lucas has surrounded himself with too many ""Yes"" men for far too long. Someone needs to tell him that he is out of touch with what the fans want to see, and that he needs to get down off his ""High Horse"". I loved the first series of Star Wars movies. These Last two were just awful! The actors were all horrible, especially the guy who played anakin, who was, at times, down right embarrassing to watch. The plot was way off, and the special effects all looked like poorly done cartoon images. This movie could have been so much more. The only thing good about the whole movie was the soundtrack, which I believe is outstanding."
3,"Not a great movie, but a fun one.","All right, the writing is terrible; the talented actors give the most wooden line readings; and the love story is hamhanded, silly and just WRONG.But who cares? Ewan McGregor, even with that hair, Hayden Christiansen and Natalie Portman sure are nice to look at, even if that love story is just short of excruciating. Samuel L. Jackson gets to say ""The party's over."" JarJar's barely in the thing. And, to top it all off and save the movie, Yoda FIGHTS!The hints of Anakin becoming Darth Vader are compelling. And the action in the last 45 minutes of this save the film almost entirely.And it all doesn't matter because you know we're all going to be in line again to find out how it all ends."
3,Fun to watch,"Having just seen Attack of the clones on the big screen I felt I can now write a review, unlike some people who have seen the trailers and decided to rate this film. The fight scenes are great, no doubt about it. However the acting from some of the cast is shakey at best, Ewan is good as Obi Wan, as expected of him he delievers his character very well. The plot is better than Phantom Menace, and flows well in the film. However there is a lot of jumping to and fro from one character to another, it is almost a relief when they hooked up together. The last 30 min are the best by far, but this film is lacking an evil bad guy like the first three. Jango Fett does not live up to the hype, and Christopher Lee is only involved at the end really,there is just no Darth Vader. I think that if Mr Lucas had let someone else direct the acting would be a little better, and the heavy use of CG does not help them fit into their roles. Worth a see, but The Two Towers is still the one to wait for."
4,Great Movie for older children but too much for youngsters,Starwars episode 2 is an exelent movie. It was the best movie I ever saw.The scenes were great and the special effects are awsome.I encourage if you are a starwars fan that you see this movie. I also encourage that you see the other ones first.If you don't it may be hard to understand.I think you should not take children under 10 to see this movie. I think they chose the perfect actors for each part.The actors are also Very good at acting.Unlike in episode 1. I really recomend that all starwars fans see this movie
3,bad bad bad bad bad bad bad,it skips halfway its dirtygets way too hot wrong movie bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad
4,"1st came broken, replaced it right away","when i got my original copy i tried watching it and the entire middle half did not work, however after contacting the selling they replaced it for me free of charge. i was very pleased with the costumer service and my new copy works great."
2,still havent gotten it right?,"sigh. where to begin? anakins gut-wrenchingly bad acting? the sappiest cornball romance? (they did NOT just roll together on the grassy hill) the completely unoriginal, unconvincing (even if you tried) action sequences (seemly designed strictly for the video game)? the gross over-use of CG? (its 3/4 cartoon really)I could go on, but these are the shallow reasons why Lucas has let me down. Lost in the new episodes are the completely NATURAL and HUMAN relationships, interactions, dialogue, and behavior of the original SW characters. Episodes 1+2 contain the most STIFFly performed, unengaging scenes, with every actor convinced that they must act 'dignified' at all times. Granted, they are jedis and politicians, but it just gets irritatingly fake and pretentious after a while. Absolutely none of the relaxed/easy feel that made the original characters so charismatic and appealing. Don't see any new stars born, in other words."
4,A step up from Episode I...,"This movie was better than its predecessor, but it again had a different twist to it. They spent too much time on Anakin and Padme, we got the theme after the first five minutes. But this movie has more action than Episode I, therefore the title ""Attack of the Clones"". My favorite scene was the Obi Wan-Jango Fett battle on Kamino. That was an exciting scene. And Yoda going crazy on Count Dooku was another great scene. Overall better than Episode I, again, any Star Wars fan should pick this up and add it to their collection."
5,Everything a movie needs,"Why are so many people down on this movie. It is fun action packed and full of great effects. Mostly people complain about the movies love story. Well is wasn't that bad a couple bad lines but not enough to ruin the absolutly fun entairtanment the movie provides. Plus I found Padme to be a hottie. It also anwsers several questions about the Star Wars saga. We also get to see Yoda fight. This is my favorite part of the movie. Heck it is the best scene in any movie ever. The DVD has great picture, sound, extras. This is the movie to buy."
2,Technically brilliant - content empty,"The DVD is technically brilliant, the simulation lifelike and almost seamless. so what's wrong with this DVD? No storyline. Well, maybe a pathetic little story line overwhelmed by special effects. This episode is even more unbelievable that Episode 1 but without an annoying chatterbox. You never connect with the male lead (jerk is a good discription) and the romantic interest was laughable! Obiwan's adventures keeps the video afloat. The only really delightful sequence is kungfu yoda, light sabre will travel! If you have to see this, rent it. If you are compelled to buy it for your collection (DVD packrat) wait a year and pick it up in the bargain bin."
2,The film is rudderless,"A totally uninspired effort by the Star Wars team. The love scenes between Anikin and Amidala are almost painful to watch. I found myself unable to care whether they lived or died. In fact, all of the characters in the story seem limp and lifeless. The one exception would be Christopher Lee. He is the quintessetial villian.Unless you are a Star Wars fanatic, I would give this one a pass."
1,HILARIOUSLY AWFUL,"Again check out RedLetterMedia's critique that recently came out of Episode 2, this movie has no plot and the whole 'romance' story has to be the worst in all cinema. Another sticking point is how they TELL us how Anakin and Obi-Wan are great friends instead of SHOWING us. Horribly written, this movie is yet another excuse to sell merchandise, do yourself a favor - don't bother watching this crap unless you want a laugh watching the cringe inducing dialogue being delivered"
1,Worse than Episode I (if that's possible),"If only I could give it zero stars. Read my review of Episode I, if you want more info."
2,Childish,"This the first and only Star Wars movie that I've seen (I saw it in theaters) and the reason I saw it was because of the hype around ""Star Wars"". Everywhere you turn they talked about ""Star Wars"". So I went to see it and I was SHOCKED.This movie is so childish, I was shaking my head the whole time. It's full of weird looking characters that act & talk like retarded creatures, it's just so childish!!! I couldn't believe my eyes, I expected something that ""could"" appeal to an adult. I mean even Harry Potter looked good, it was not an insult to intelligence. I will never understand why adults camp outside theaters weeks before the release of Star Wars movies. This movie is for people under age 12, SERIOUSLY. I felt insulted as an adult viewer. The only reason I gave it 2 stars is that ""perhaps"" kids would enjoy it."
2,Hayden Christiansen could'nt act his way out of a paper bag.,"Based on Hayden Christiansen's performance, and poor dialogue, I wanted to smack Anakin and tell him to stop being such a whiner. Instead of showing what trials caused Anakin to go to the dark side this movie shows him for a weak willed little sniviler who was destined to go bad. Let's hope for installment three 1. George gets someone else to write the script and 2. Hayden learns how to be a better actor."
4,This was the worst Star Wars movie but Most action packed,"This had to be the worst Star Wars movie yet. It had terrrible acting, and terrible Dialogue. It was also practicly all computer generated ...! It had to be the most boring Star Wars movie also. Even more boring than ""The Empire Strikes Back"".On the other hand it had to have had The coolest most kick ... battle at the end, with more action than all the others combined.. I'm also a Star Wars Fan so the movie was still interesting to me. That's why I gave it Four stars."
2,Sort of corny,"The dialogue was darn right cheesy, Hayden Christensen's acting was undeniably bad. It was cringe-worthy at times. I like Natalie Portman, but even she was bland and borderline awful in this.On the plus, the lightsaber battles are again, the best part of any Star Wars film. The effects are all done very well, and the music score was also fine."
2,Disappointing,"The time line of the prequels is very disjointed compared to the original Trilogy. I was particularly offended at the blatant inconsistencies in this film. For instance, we are apparently so stupid we will believe that in the 10 years since Anakin left his Mother, she was sold, freed, married, and gave birth to a bouncing 18 year old baby boy.For as long as it took for these films to be made, it feels like the story and script were just slapped together."
4,It wasn't bad...Had some freaking awesome moments,"Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones really get's downplayed a whole lot, when really, you think about it...The was some plain freakin' awesome moments in there.Mind you it did lack a bit, and many diminish Hayden Christenson as a bad actor (Something they'll regret saying after Episode III is released), but come on...If anything, this movie has some awesome Jedi action mixed into the huge battle array of the Clone Wars. Best of all we see what made Master Yoda himself (Frankly...he kicks butt, as we will see again in Epiosde III).I definatly think it deserved more than it's getting, and I think after III, people will understand it and like it more."
2,Episode II,"Hayden Christensen ... is just too horrible. Pinnacle of bad acting. IMHO, he ruined a perfectly good movie. I just recently watched it again on DVD and I had to write a review. BOOOO!"
2,a little better,"a step in the right direction, much better than the truly awful episode 1, but still some very cheesy dialogue, and lots of actors that weren't up to par with the great samuel l jackson. the young boba fett was annoying, the romance while necessary was too schmaltzy, but the clone wars were cool and they are the only reason it gets a 2 besides seeing samuel l remove a head, jar jar still stinks."
4,Shoulda got the widescreen,"The movie is fantastic, the bonus disc outstanding. My only diappointment is that I didn't get the 16:9 widescreen format.Oh, well... shouldn't have left it to the wife to pick it up."
5,The best starwars movie,"Esta es la más espectacular de todas las películas de starwars. Los efectos, la trama, la música están perfectamente entrelazados provocando una sensación de suspenso y emoción durante toda la película. La he visto muchas veces y cada vez que la veo nuevamente descubro algún nuevo detalle que me hace entender un poco más lo bien lograda que está esta clásica novela de la ciencia ficción."
2,One Big Cartoon of a Movie,"The main problem with Star Wars - Episode II, Attack of the Clones is the special effects. The actors look lost and confused most of the time because they are constantly behind blue screens. The end battle looks like a cartoon, it looked like the actors were trapped in Toy Story world. Another problem is the script, it is really lame, with lines like "" Sand is corse, but not like you, you are everything soft."" its corny lines like this that make some scences laughable. George lucas is probly the laziest dirctor of all time. This film was not directed by George lucas it was directed by the good guys ofI.L.M Cause this movie is one big special effect. Its sad to hear John Williams legendary score over this waste of a Star Wars film. I hope Lucas trys a little harder with episode 3. Actually i pray."
1,Laughinably Bad,After a 3rd viewing of this movie the other night i struck me just how awful this movie is..absolutely awful plot..sub-par special effects...wasted talents of very good actors on awful dialogue and poor direction..not a believable set piece in the whole movie the whole thing looks blue screened..and badly blue screened..and the bad chinese accents on the aliens..and those lousy creatures at the end in the arena that look like a 3rd grader thought them up..i mean this is really awful filmaking..i dont know which was worse this or Phantom Menace..Mr Lucas needs to stop directing and move on to another line of work.
3,It was...,"I have to say, this was not much fun to watch in most parts. The great thing about the original trilogy was it was fun. It was dark in parts, which was great, but it was fun. Episode 2 was not much fun (except for the Yoda fight). I read the review about the whole courtly love thing, but I don't think this is a movie that you should have to research to understand. The dialogue was just plain awful, whether it was courtly or not! The most important component of a movie is the story, but apparently, George Lucas missed that lesson. Why would Padme fall for such a whiny brat, but who even cares after seeing this? The only redeeming features of this movie are Ewan McGregor, who continues to do good work, in spite of Lucas; the imaginative art department who, again in spite of Lucas, came up with some cool looking stuff; and Christopher Lee, who is having some great roles at last!"
3,Another star wars movie,"At first i thought this was a really good movie. But as I watched it a second time. I found that Hayden's acting was not as real, like he just saying the words with no feeling. I think the acting could have been better too. I also thought that Lucas focus to much of the movie on love and needed more action so theVerdict: 3 stars for story and cool background-1 for to much love-1 for corny acting"
5,THIS IS THE ONLY PURE DIGITAL DVD TRANSFER,"Most DVD movies ... big time after watching them more than once. NOT THIS DVD it has over 6 hours of extra features. This version of star wars is great to watch over and over. The sound effects are wonderful on a surround sound system too. All I have to say is ""WOW"" buy this DVD and watch it over and over !"
4,amazing,Despite some shotty acting from Hayden Chrisstiansan and Nathale Portman it was excellent. Special Effects are at a max. I suggest watching with the volume cranking. Lightsaber fight will never be the same with the volume pumping.
2,"""Gidget"" meets ""Gladiator"" meets ""The Jetsons""","I used to be a Star Wars fanatic. But the script to Attack of Clones was incoherent, the acting - especially Hayden Christiansen - wasn't as good as what you could expect in most high school junior class plays, and the special effects were dazzling to the point of distraction. Nothing could detract from the fact that George Lucas has lost touch with what made the original movies so good. If you are a pre-teen to teen, the Young Miss crowd or its male equivilant, you'll love this. But if you are a fan of the previous movies, save yourself the disappointment..."
5,Pure and Enjoyable,"...P>This movie was pure in its adherence to the original Star Wars universe and continues to develop the back story of the original trilogy. Not only was it exactly what us REAL Star Wars fans needed to see (of course, we always want more), but it gave us glimpse of what is to come in Episode III.George Lucas makes his films, his stories, and shoots and tells his stories the way he wants, and I believe him to be a rare gift in film. Someone who does what he wants.... He is the true free spirit in film, but with the resources to make good, pioneering movies...."
1,Waaaa!,I am giving this a five-star review to offset the detractors. I feel mildly warm towards this movie.
1,FORGET THE RAZZIES!,"I am so sick of hearing that this movie was nominated for ""Worst film of the year!"" Now, having said that, it's definitely a contender. ""I coulda been a contenda!"""
2,This Movie Is Pretty Bad,"One thing, please stop the fight for full-screen and wide-screen it is kinda bogus now....I enjoyed the special effects and everything, but this was mocking all the Star Wars movies before! They had a bad actor to play Anakin! You could make a better Anakin by grabbing Mike Myers and put robes on him! The only reason my father bought this was to try to get the full collection of Star Wars... This movie did not have the thrill of Star Wars Episode 5 or the excitement of episode 6...You think if Episode 1 actaully was good then Star Wars Episode 2 might be a little better! I'm sorry but this movie was not good! I give it 2 stars for the effort they put into it."
2,not much better than Episode III,"Episodes 1-3 got progressively worse, but casting Christian Hayden in the role of ""adolescent/adult Anniken"" was a mistake. He's terrible, he over-acts, and he has zero chemistry with Natalie Portman. But, it's part of the Star Wars series now, and I had to add it to our home-viewing options."
3,"Ok price, was the only dealer selling this movie by itself","Purchased this for my nephew for Christmas. Thought it was pricey for one movie, but I couldn't afford the 3 movies that you can buy in a pack at this time.This was the only dealer I could find selling this single movie by itself in the series, so thanks for that.Was packaged well and received in a timely manner.Would buy from this dealer again."
3,All right,"The prequel trilogy is fairly long, and could have been condensed into a duology without any real negative impact on the story. One thing I definitely enjoyed was seeing Jango and Boba Fett. This movie isn't awful and I certainly enjoyed many parts of it, but this and the first movie could have been put together, because Episodes 1 and 2 are more of an build-up for Episodes 3 and onward."
2,"lucas needs help,fast!","This movie is nowhere near as great as episode 1,except for yoda fighting christopher lee,mcgregor and jackson and the opening credits, it [stinks].The romantic scenes in this...make the ones in pearl harbor look good.And just because you FINALLY get to see another head cut off, and some limbs removed,that does not make this as good as ""THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK"".To come close to that there has to be some acting going on between portman and that new guy,which is sad because portman can act very well. the two most horrible things that have happened to these films are that with digital technology, lucas sticks with the effects and nothing else.He made the big mistake of not hiring someone else for number 2.And dont try and tell me number 1 was the setup and this is the payoff,thats bull.you can watch any of the original 3 and each one works on its own.If what lucas said is true and this thing was part of a thirty year mission to come to the screen,star wars is dead."
4,the empire begins,This is a great science fiction movie this has made an improvement over episode 1.But they alot of better films in 2002 like Iceage Spiderman and Lord of the Rings 2.This one has better battles and a better villan than Darth Maul.Count Doouku played by Christopher Lee the guy from Lord of the Rings.and one more thing they have a great lightsaber dual bettween Yoda and Dooku
5,"Clone this critics and superficial ""fans""!!","Yep, I give this movie 5 stars. Lucas is a genious as he ties all of the Star Wars movies nicely together and Attack sets the table for the recently released Revenge. Get over it if you think this is also boring. It is a STORY that has to be told to understand the rest of the episodes of the classic saga."
1,Oh dear,"Being a Lucas fan, my disapointment is enormous with this movie. I thought the best actors (Mcgregor, Lee, Jackson) were poorly used (if at all) and the Portman/Anakin duo were emphasized even though their acting is atrocious. This movie also lacked a vital soul and a true plot. I hope VI is better.PREDICTION: I bet no one waits 2 months in line for the tickets to the next one."
5,My Son and I love this!,"Great family fun, FINALLY a PG movie we can all see together. Wonderfully made and would reccommend it to enjoy with your kids."
2,star wars episode 2,i did not enjoy this movie. i wish george lucas had added more plot and sped up the movie to be able to include more of the clone wars instead of having to make an animated tv show
2,"Better than the last, but generally mediocre","If this movie did not say STAR WARS, most reviewers would give it 1 to 3 stars. It is bloated with action scenes that rely solely on computer animation and has little plot. The CGI that gains so much praise looks cheaply done in places. The acting is garbage, but if you watch the original three more closely, they were not really about the acting either. The intrigue of the first three was partly in character development. The audience saw the characters grow and change together, with their relationships developing along the way. In these films we have to skip large chunks of people's lives and see more new characters in every film. The closeness is not there, neither between the main characters, nor with the audience.A lot of people have commented that it is ""a good Star Wars movie."" I agree that it is definitely a Star Wars movie, but it is not ""good"" by any standard."
1,It's all about Marketing,Lucas is only interested in selling merchandise. Nothing more. I'm disappointed in his two latest efforts. I know no one who is interested in any further Star Wars flicks.
1,Yikes!!,Can we do something to remove Lucas from all future Star Wars endeavors? That would be helpful. Thanks
1,Fire Lucas immediately,"Wow, that was bad. Whatever positive thoughts I had about Star Wars are now drowned in the nausea that overwhelmed me after watching this ridiculous video game of a movie.I agree with it being nominated for Razzies ""Worst Film of the Year!"""
2,2 in a half stars,thsi i thought was just okay pepole hated episode one but i liked it. howevr i dint like as much. frist of all hayden chirtisan was so terrible in the role i heard he was good in other things. usally i dont attack perfomance i meanIlike jake lloyd but hayden really bothered me. so sorry if he ever reads this. second there was to much romance. The orignal trigoly had some romance but they kept to the back of the atction this is like the star wars the soap opera version. i did like the action espically yoda with the lightsaber. i will probaly get the dvd for the extras but overall i was dissapointed.
3,The best story ever... being told by a janitor,"I gave this movie three stars because it works well in the context of Phantom Menace. I'm a BIG Star Wars fan, and that lets me appreciate the story, but the movie itself fell flat. I remember years ago wondering why George Lucas didn't direct Empire or Jedi, and now I know. Lucas will always remain one of the best storytellers ever, but he should delegate the next movie to some other people; treat it like the first trilogy. That alone could save the three pre-quels."
1,Why are people giving this good reviews???,"The ORIGINAL films are by far the ones that stand the test of time. Episode I and II are so cheesy I need to find me some crackers!! Episode II has a pathetic love story that is just too gross to actually take seriously. I expected episode II to be the ""evil/ dark"" one where things start to really happen. Um....wrong. Besides the soon to be Darth Vader's whining I didn't find most of the ""story"" to be of interest. And don't even get me started on Yoda and his little fight scene.........HORRIBLE!!!!!To even suggest that episode I and II are better or even equal to the original trilogy is an insult!!"
4,A great film,"The special effects and storyline are incredible. Many questions from the original trilogy are answered, like where the stormtroopers and Boba Fett came from, why Luke calls Owen and Beru uncle and aunt, who designed the Death Star and why Vader has wires on his severed hand in Return of the Jedi. They're heading in the right direction for Episode III."
3,NOT the Best yet,"Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen) was unexciting, not really into the part. He just didn't draw us into the movie. Corny, silly romance scenes and acting with little emotion. Some very nice special effects, not a good enough story line to make it all worthwhile. Some decent acting by other characters, but my wife and I were both disappointed overall."
2,yawn....,"I enjoy sci-fi movies including the early Star Wars films. This latest Star Wars movie must have been made by the merchandising department as I find it hard to believe that the George Lucas we know from his earlier works made this one. Even the early work, THX 1138 shines in comparison."
2,This Movie is Baaaaaaaaaaaaaaad!,"Hahahaha. Look at all the people clamor to the theater in order to soak in the latest piece of . . . passing itself off as a Star Wars movie. ""Why do I have the feeling you'll be the death of me someday"", says Obi-Wan to Anakin as we are supposed to laugh at the foreshadowing George Lucas sets up, except that we already know that Obi dies by Anakin. So the joke's not funny and neither is every other intended joke in this crudfest. The only funny part is the supposed ""romance"" between Padme and Anakin, which feels about as intense as a hula hoop.The little diner that Obi-Wan visits, what the hell does it all mean? This movie has waaaaaaaay too many modern references, do yourself a favor and rent episodes four through six and skip out on ep. 3 because I'm sure it'll be as bad as the last two. George Lucas better take the next movie off and try and regain his sense of adventure because this franchise is more stale than a crouton."
1,I would've given a 3 but...,"You guys are giving scores that are way too higher than the movie truly deserves. This movie sucks, period. The special effects are great but its storyline is very lame and pretentious. And why imitate Blade Runner? It doesn't look like a Star Wars film at all but a parody of several ""cool(or hippy?)"" movies like The Matrix. This movie lacks originality.Yeah I agree that this DVD version has lots of great extras, but the movie itself is really bad(Of course, I know AOTC is not a artsy movie.). The story's boring, the acting's very flat mainly because of the director, and the editing was choppy and amateurish. And who wrote the stupid script? Even the fight scenes were so so compared to B-level Hong Kong movies.This movie does NOT deserve a five star. This movie generated lots of money because it's a ""Star Wars"" movie, and nothing else."
2,"STINK, STANK, (...)!","Like many others, I anxiously awaited Episode II. I am a Star Wars fan, and went to this movie the day it opened.What a WASTE of money! This movie was pretty awful!!! I don't want to put any spoilers in here, so I will not go into specific details.Natalie Portman does an OK job. My true beef is with Hayden Christensen. This guy has no true PASSION for the role in which he plays.Most of the movie has true mediocre acting. There are a few people that make the video worth renting, but definitely NOT buying unless you simply want it for the collection.The last 20 minutes of the movie were the best,but by that time (because this is not a short movie) I was having to control my yawning. One redeeming aspect of the movie is that during the ending portion of the movie YODA rocks!!In short, RENT but DON'T BUY, not worth your time or $$$$."
1,George Lucas has completely lost it...,"Bad acting, incoherent story, horrible climax... I find it outrageous that this was the end result of a project that Lucas has been planning since the original trilogy. What it all comes down to is horrible writing. Anakin was horribly miscasted and his acting was painful to watch. George Lucas is so bad at writing dialogue that he actually made a cast of great actors including Samuel L. Jackson, Ewan McGregor, and Natalie Portman look like stiff amateurs. The movie seemed to revolve around actions scenes that were indiscriminately thrown in the story left and right without any real build up to them.Yes, it was beautifully shot, but to what end? A worthless heap of [stuff] that is called ""Episode II: Attack of the Clones."""
2,"Forced, not The Force","The two stars are given to Yoda. He is the only redeeming part of the film. The entire movie was badly written, acted and it was forced. It was over the top even for sci-fi. I mean the part in the begining when Anakin jumps from the vehicle-come on! And Obi Wan is nervous about Anakin's piloting, I thought Jedi's were to control their fear. Duku was not all that exciting either. To tell you the truth I think The Phantom Menace was a better film. Darth Maul was awesome! Duku lacked the dred that Maul brought to the scren. No one can replace Darth Vader but, If Darth Maul had more screen time he would have been a close runner up. I will see the third film just to get some closure but, I don't have very hi hopes. I will probably wait for it to be released on DVD. I was born in 1972, so I am going to have to stick with the Star Wars that I grew up with."
1,Come on..,"Is this really a five-star movie? Can't all you Lucas boot-lickers say the truth? It's really a 2.5 star movie (the one star here is to offset the fudgers).I am upset at how bad this movie really is, the acting, the plot, etc, etc.."
4,A Long Long Time Ago... In A Galaxy Far Far Away,"About six years after episode one, Obi-Wan Kenobi and his Apprentice Anakin Skywalker (aka Darth Vader. well not yet anyways) come to protect Senator Amadala. Then something comes up and Obi-Wan goes to investigate a cloning facility on a different planet, this is where they meet Boba and Jango Fett. Meanwhile Anakin and Senator Amadala start to flare up in love. Then later Jango Fett lets the Dark Side have a army of Clones thus having a clone war. The ending sequence is where Anakin and Senator Amadala get married.I suggest this movie to any big star wars fan. It is just like the old trilogy. It is like reliving it once agian."
3,I Beg You,"Memo to George Lucas:I beg you, PLEASE let someone else write the dialogue for the final Star Wars movie! You can give the screenwriter the story, the scenes and characters, but I'm begging you, no more ""wooden"" dialogue. It's downright embarrassing. I cringe when I hear some of the stuff you force the actors to say. You wasted the talents of Portman, McGregor and Jackson.If you can ignore the brutal dialoge (and acting from Christensen), then this movie is amazing visually. The story is better than that of The Phantom Menace. The acting is on par with The Menace though (thanks to Lucas). This is a 5 star movie visually but the character dialoge drags it down to 3. Just think how great this could've been had a real screenwriter and director got the most out of this cast. I'm thinking Christensen might be passable as an actor if he wasn't reading ""Lucas Speak"". Get the DVD and view it on as big a screen as possible with SurroundSound."
5,One of the Best,"Star Wars Episode II, was one of the best movies ever made. I saw on this site that many people didn't like it. Well you know what? Don't listen to them. You have to see movies for your self. Don't listen to others, because who knows you might like it. Or just rent it before you buy it. I hate when other people tell you not to see a movie or TV show, only becase ""THEY"" didn't like it.If its looks good and you what to see, then SEE it!"
1,ZZZZZZZZZ,"This movie very nearly literally put me to sleep. If it could be bottled and prescribed, it would sell as well as Valium. The acting is bad. The dialogue is even worse. The CGI animation is faker than Milli Vanilli. One great big ole snoozefest."
1,snooze...,"When I sat down to watch Attack of the clones,I was hoping it would restored my faith in George Lucas and the Star Wars series. Unfortunately, it was not to be. This is worse then the Phantom Menace. The acting is dreadful. Most of them are spouting off philosophical lines like there got sticks up there butts. Ewan McGregor is so boring as Obi-wan. Hayden Christensen is terrible, he wines so much it's hard to believe this is the future Darth Vader. Natalie Portman is still wooden. The Jedi are idiots and deserve what they get. I was cringing throughout the romantic scenes. This movie is boring and has no soul. George Lucas cannot write or direct, his dialogue is cheesy and the action scenes are a mess, take the lightsaber fight scene between Yoda and Dooku, showing Yoda bouncing around like a soccer ball was so ridiculous I was laughing. Lucas, get someone else to direct the next movie and maybe then will see a good prequel."
1,I dedicate this review to Jonathon Taylor,"Hey, Jonathon, I just want you to know this this movie was terrible.But you know what's worse? Your spelling. Get a dictionary, kid."
1,What Happened?,What is wrong with George Lucas and his new creations? The acting is terrible and the FX do not give the film enough power to live up to the Star Wars name. This is a trilogy that will shame the name of Star Wars.
4,Good but no Empire,If you want the benchmark of Star Wars films you have to look at Empire Strikes back. The depth of Empire sets it apart from the rest of the Star Wars films. But to the fact. ATOC is a fun adventure which is what I expect from Star Wars nothing more and nothing less.The special effects are par for what i expect from a visual genius of Lucas's calibur. Seeing Yoda fight is worth the price of admission alone.The soundtrack is not up to par with Williams Id say. There is no memorable catch like all the other films. The Duel of Fates and the Imperial March are used in parts of which I love but nothing new of consequence.Lucus is still a master but this time around he has been caught and passed by the Lord of the Rings which used a better story (written by a Professor) and equally as impressive effects to create a world deeper and more rich with history.The film id place ahead of The Phantom Menace and Return of the Jedi but behind A New Hope and Empire Strikes Back.
5,"one of, if not the, best in the series","I've never been a huge Star Wars fan, and I've always thought the films were overrated. The story lines were never impressive, the only reason I watched them was for the scenery and action. Same goes for this film, only the scenery and action are unmatched. This film looks incredible. It still suffers from the weaknesses of the other films, in my opinion, but the visuals alone were worth my [money]."
2,"Thumbs down, another episode one, minus an original plot.","There comes at time in making sequels when using the same form of visual effects over and over to display battles no one really wants to see fails to keep the audience excited. On a whole the film represents a failure to bring in an original plot while having no hesitation to show endless scenes of battles with the latest graphic technology. This is another of the bland-plot films flowing out of the movie business at the moment. It would be nice to see a more complicated plot and a more intelligent script in future movies of this sort, otherwise we are in a dire state indeed."
3,All right but not great,Out of all the Star War movies this one was the worst. When I first saw the movie it was before I saw Revenge of the Sith and I was confused. The next time I saw it it was after Revenge of the Sith and I realized that Lucas was just wait to make the final movie. This movie was just forshadowing the rest. That was basically the whole plot.Then there was the horrendous love scenes. I'm not saying that Annakin shouldn't fall in love with Padmai but do we need to spend half of the movie watching them kiss in front of lakes and roll around pastures. Even worst the acting was horrible! When Padmai and Annakin are supposed to give each other lovestruck looks the actors give each other murderous grins. I don't now Why Lucas choose Natalie Portman and (especially) Christain Anderson (I think that his name.)Then there is also the pointless gruesome scene where Annakin loses his arm. Lucas should just save all the gore until the next movie when it is needed.
3,"""If for no other reason....""","If for no other reason, one must own this DVD for it's visual reference quality, particulary those with higher-end set-ups. No other DVD comes close in showcasing what DVDs can do! For example, check out the sequence early on in the film where Obi-Wan and Anakin are chasing the bounty hunter Zam Wesell on Coruscant. WOW! The level of detail given to the urban landscape is just incredible. You can even make out all of the tiny lighted windows on all of the buildings! And the chase sequence by Jango Fett in pursuit of Obi-Wan's Jedi Starfighter amidst the asteroid field above Geonosis. Outstanding! Just thought I had put this out there."
1,What's with the 5-star reviews and the 1-star reviews?,"It's called ""The Emperor's New Clothe"".The ones 'blown away' by this movie, I believe, are blinded by the name ""Star Wars"" and ""George Lucas"". This combination can do no wrong.The ones who see this movie for what it is, stand to be a minority but a worthy bunch. Because at a time when the mob mentality rules, they refuse to be duped.I gave 1-star because I am a saddened original trilogy fan. What makes me sad is the way Lucas and Company uses the original trilogy to milk more money and to cheat the trilogy's many adoring fans with ""clones"" that have no spirit and no life. What started out as a young man's dream about the universe and the ""force"" now is reduced to....self-denial, grandiosity, and pretension."
1,Star Wars - Generation Lost,"Quite simply, the new movies are not nearly as good as the originals - in quality (see Episode I - Phantom Menace) and especially in Titles. The basis of the Star Wars Galaxy is rooted in Epic tradition and Mythology. Episode I not only lacked all of the characteristics of being EPIC, but it also was not designed for the intelligent audience. Mysticism, creative thinking and interpretation were lost on todays audience, as the plot, story and characters were trivial and immature at best - as well as obvious and driven to a point. While Carrie Fisher and Mark Hamill we able to act as young adults, our new cast are ""children"" by comparison. Maybe less technology and graphics and an actual story would bring back the quality.For those who think that my review is based on ""I hate SW"" you ar mistaken. I grew up on it, wrote my college thesis on it, have read every book and played every video game. I stand by my assessment"
3,titled wrong,"One of the things that bug me here is that thigns are titled wrong. They tell me that I shouldnt get angry about that, that I cant controll what people title thigns, but I think my titles are so much better its frustrating. So here are my titles for the series:Episode I: A Jedi is BornEpisode II: The Jedi Comes of AgeEpisode III: The Fall of the Jedi (This is guessing because I havent seen Ep III yet...but maybe George Lucas will read this and see i'm right and this will be the title...here's hoping...)Thanks for reading my review."
3,It's a star war movie,I didn't buy this movie but I saw it and it is A Star Wars Movie. Who cares if it is bad or good. It is still a Star Wars movies and it good.
1,Horrified,"I am extremely upset at this horrific effort to market to young kids via technology while otherwise ruining a great series. This film could have been done with one tenth the special effects and more acting and it would have been incredible given the talent on hand.Unless the next film is amazing, then the prequels will be judged by all to have been a monumental waste."
4,The Chief's Response,"There have been few Perfect films made in the industry. Which is why I gave 4 stars. The truth of the matter is George Lucas, the man is arguably the greatest film maker and inovater in the industry.. George has intertained me for thirty years and I have not been disappointed once in all that time. I do crab about the time between releases of his films but never the planning in creating them. George gets the most from the resourses he has and that is why there is room for improvement in the rating. Mister Lucas I award you a BRAVO ZULU! Keepim Cranking. Chief ""D"""
4,The Ultimate Gamesman.......,Although they could have found a stronger candidate to play Annakin Skywalker (James Franco for example) this movie was good.To see the suttle ways people were being manipulated. To see evenMaster Yoda stymied has you wondering. My favorite part of the plot is to see the love blossom between Padme and Annikan. The arena scene will go down as one of the greatest in motion picture history. I hope Episode III lives up to it predescessors.
1,nice special effects.,"Mr. Lucas has lost whatever made the first 3 star wars movies compelling, and the ability to get great performances out of limited actresses as well. This is just hilariously bad. Sure looks pretty though."
2,Wow this movie is horrible.,"I really wanted to like it but after the 4th time I could no longer stomach it. The story telling is terrible, the effects are so overwhelming(I'm beginning to get a migrain) and the acting...........come on... it is so bad I wonder what went wrong. Hopefully,,hope,,hope the final installment will rectify this horrible new franchise that started in '99"
4,Better Than Episode 1,"This is the 2nd film in the Star Wars series. It mostly sets up the events in Episode 3 and the old trilogy. episode 2 takes place 10 years after the events in Episode 1. It has a lot more action and story than the 1st. The origin of the Clone War is documented. This is probably my favorite of the 3 prequels. I don't like Hayden Christensen at all, but the rest of the cast is great. It's is everything you would expect from a Star Wars movie."
3,Okay,"In my opinion, this movie was a bit of a let down. Don't get me wrong, the effects in it were awesome! The acting itself left a lot to be desired. Ewan Mcgregor did a great job but the guy who played Anakin needs to go back to acting school. He would've done a better job if he didn't try to act out the part. Very poor. George Lucas needed to find better actors to finish out this series."
1,Another Sell-Out piece of schlock from a Former master,"George, George, George. . . how you lifted us up with your first 3 titles, and then fell to pieces with the last two movies. I think you would have had a better movie if you cast simians as actors! 'Nuff said. Just remember, you don't have to say you liked this movie, just to support the SW line. It is what it is: low-brow drivel."
3,"A step up from Phantom Menace, not quite Empire Strikes Back","Episode II suffers from some very poor acting, for which I took off one star. Maybe jedis and senators are supposed to talk in monotone. But I couldn't stand it. The movie suffers from bad ""romance"" scenes, for which I took off a second star.But I'm letting it go with a passing grade, because this was altogether a good movie, putting the series back on track. The politics are more dramatic and Jar Jar is restrained. Ironically, a good scene combines both Jar Jar and the Senate, when Jar Jar proposes awarding the Chancellor supreme powers. The action is very watchable, and Yoda is great. I'm not a hardcore Star Wars fan, but this movie reflects some of the series' best elements. It remains to be seen whether Episode III, which Lucas promised would be dark, can possibly match Episode V."
3,A Mixed Bag,"This Star Wars episode has some of the best special effects of the series. Yet it is disappointing insofar as the plot and character development. I found it quite boring in many places and had to fight nodding off. Hopefully, the third installment of this series will overcome this ho-hum problem."
3,Okay.,"Lucas had done a pretty good job at this film. Star Wars films had always hailed in visual effects, and they ae so awesome in this film. THe battle scenes are so spectacular and mind blowing. There's no ... Jake Lloyd (THANK GOD) in this film, but a bit of Jar Jar ... . The plot a decent, a fits in with the other Star Wars episodes. Yoda was abit crazy and unatural, but oh well. Love story was not very good. Dialogue was bad.They shouldn't have brattish teenagers in this film. I especially hate the part when Anakin says that he hate obi wna, and that he thinks thatobi wan is jealous about him, and Anakin brags about being the greates jedi ever. That's [bad] dialogue.It's just sickening. That disgraces Star Wars. I hope Episode 3 will really promise something that all Star Wars fans all have been waiting for, without the teens,without cute and cuddly characters, without a bad dialogue, not so happy (like episode 1-BOMB), more dark, and more evil. THat's what the fans want."
1,Worse than Episode I,"Yes, the universally despised Jar Jar Binks was almost entirely eliminated from Attack of the Clones, and yet this atrocious sequel still manages the seemingly impossible feat of being worse than its predecessor... He used to be a capable director, after all, he's responsible for American Graffiti, and he has to be given credit for coming up with the Star Wars franchise in the first place, but he is not a writer and this is painfully evident throughout both Episodes I and II. Acting as writer, producer and director all that the same time, he spreads himself too thin... Anakin and Amidala's love scenes are the most embarassingly bad things to be seen in theaters for a very, very long time."
1,"Gods, this movie was bad...",Every moment of Hayden Christensen on the screen is just agony.But I can't blame Hayden--as horrible as he was--for this disaster. I blame the man who cast him. I blame the man who wrote the script. I blame the man who directed the film.I blame George.
2,Better than Episode One,This film is rather tedious and quite uninteresting. The cinematography gives the film a busy look lending to its mediocrity. The actors look tired and board as is the script. Go back to Episode One and savor the moment.
4,"Good, but not quite perfect","In terms of acting, plot, dialogue, and special effects, Attack of the Clones is light years beyond The Phantom Menace. Much of the movie focuses on the mystery of the clone army. It ends with a spectacular battle scene - still one of the best sci-fi battles out there.I like a lot about Attack of the Clones, but at the end of the day it just seems like the plot still needed to be worked out. There is a whole mystery about who built the clone army, but this is never fully explained. Also, it's not really clear why the Separatists were building a Death Star. I'm a Star Wars geek and it took me a while to figure these plot twists out. It's certainly not going to appeal to casual fans. Also, while the main actors are fine, the extras are sometimes a bit corny - particularly the Jedi at the end of the movie and the other Separatist leaders. Good, but not quite up to par with Episodes IV and V."
4,"Rich DVD set, very good but not great movie","This is a very good movie but not a great movie. Given the budget, the hype, the expectations, and the anticipation, it's human nature for some to be a bit disappointed, but overall it is a very good movie when putting everything in context. When you are expecting an A+ movie and you get a A- movie, you maybe disappointed, but when you compare it to the rest of the movies out there, it definately stands out.The DVDs offer a rich set of bonus features, which will be greatly appreciated by Star Wars fans."
1,Did not win RAZZIES WORST FILM OF THE YEAR!,"I heard the voting was close though! All kidding aside, for this movie to be put in the same category as that aweful Madonna flick is pretty humiliating. I would not say it was THAT bad, but considerably close."
1,RAZZIES?,"Who cares if the Razzies nominated Clones for ""worst film of the year?"" If you like it, that's fine. I personally was disapointed in the entire affair. This could have been a great film given the acting talent on board, but alas, marketing dominated these days."
4,better acting & less digital effects would have been better,"I'm one who found the DVD presentation of the movie to be very average. The picture isn't as sharp as Phantom Menace, and just isn't anything special.As for the movie - well it was good. The acting was really stiff by Christensen and Portman, but I'm one who blames that entirely on the director. As evidenced by the first three movie, Star Wars films don't need first rate acting (though it would be nice), but the acting must at least be emotional and a little over acted rather than under acted as in Episode 2.There were also too many digital effects, and at times I felt like I was watching something more of a cartoon than a live shot movie.But overall, it was a pretty good Star Wars movie."
3,Its ok. But the love [stuff] kills the movie.,The movie is overall good but there are a few weak aspects about the movie. First off the movie with the love secnes are boring and need to be worked on. Two its too far in between love and action. NEED more action. the movie is alright but it needed work on it before they released it into theaters.
1,Dumb and dumber,"Episode IV was dumb, this is dumber. Now really, people, don't y'all hate this movie? I was underwhelmed. Where is Jim Carey when you need him?"
1,Zero Stars,"Unlike most people I know, I didn't hate Phantom Menace. I enjoyed it. It's got some sappy bits and some contrived bits but I convinced myself that it's just pretty fan-fiction and not actually canon.Clones is a whole other ball of wax. This flick is dreadful. Apart from some cool looking space ships and a big dumb (but fun) battle at the end, there's nothing of substance here. The writing and acting is unwatchable across the board and Lucas' refusal to use actual physical set pieces in favor of green screens and CGI is jarring and nauseating. When the floors the characters are standing on look like cartoons, it distracts from whatever pathetic story he's trying to tell.Can somebody explain to me please what's going on with Syfo Dias? I truly believe Lucas has lost his mind. Not only is he churning out these horrid films but he's now pretending that the original trilogy doesn't exist. He's a monster."
2,"Good Special Effects, Bad Everything Else","Obviously someone who doesn't like dialogue wrote the script (let me give you a hint-George Lucas), because the dialogue is lame and downright cheesy (That pickup line involving sand and Anakin? I would have slapped his face off and told him to keep walking). However, the special effects are so real looking, and that could be the problem with the infamous bad acting. If you can't see it, it's hard to talk to. Because Star Wars is such a cult classic, the writers feel as if they can get away with any bad writing because no matter what, people will still reverentially love the movie to death. And why didn't George Lucas pick someone with better talent to play Anakin? Hayden Christensen is downright horrible, even when he has a scene with someone who is real. All over, the movie stinks."
5,we'll have to watch something more subtle this time zam,"this is the best film of all time in my view.ewan macgregor,natalie portman,hayden christien and frank oz bring the movie to life.tamuera morrison and daniel logan are brilliant as jango and boba fett.christopher lee and marton csokas make guest appearences as count dooku and poggle the lesser [wonder who poggle the higher is?].samuel l jackson however is extremely dissapointing as jedi mace windu.from the action packed courascant chase to the kamino escape to the arena battle and finally to the hanger duel.the best bit is kamino escape or obi-wan versus jango fett.below is the main cast:obi-wan-ewan macgregoranakin-hayden christienpadme-natalie portmanyoda-frank ozjango-tamuera morrisondooku-christopher leewindu-samuel l jacksonboba-daniel loganpoggle-marton csokasnute\ki-adi-silas carson"
3,"Neat plot and special effects, lame lines","Episode two has impressive special effects and a more interesting plot. And the music is very good. However, there are more than a few unbelievably lame lines that make you feel like gagging. Like when yoda is facing count dooku before their lightsaber fight, he's all ""powerful you have become, Dooku, but the DARK SIDE I sense in you."" I mean come ON, how dumb is that? It is only one of the lines that deserves a big ""DUH!!"" Also, the actors in it are really good, but their talent is wasted on these rather shallow characters. Like Padme for example. Natalie Portman plays this senator who is totally stoic and calm the whole time. Sometimes, actors can still convey expression through stiocness, but this does not seem to be one of Portman's talents. Also, Jar jar is still as annoying as ever. But, some things are really cool, like the language of the Genosians, which deserves a comment."
5,No Problem With Star Wars,"The item was NEW as promised, shipped in a timely manner, and arrived safe and sound. Great price; perfect transaction."
1,Ridiculous,"PATHETICI hated this movie because it offended my delicate sensibilities. Now, the movie was a stinker, we all know. I don't get the 5 star reviews. My friends in San Fran all think this movie was not quite sensitive enough."
1,The Force is dead,"Its sad to say, but Episode 2 makes episode 1 look like a masterpiece. That said, I think you can expect where this review is going.Underdeveloped characters, too much digital effects (even the sets are fake!), and a Cheese filled story all make this film one of the worst I have ever seen. George Lucas is obviously throwing out these prequels to make money, and he has lost his devotion to the fans. Plain and simple, this movie was a marketing ploy for Lucasfilm and ILM to show their talents(?) due to the failing of his efffects company.The movie lacks detail, skill, and a coherent story, also the film seems to be directed by a twelve year old with ADD.Avoid this one at all costs folks!"
1,Overbloated,"To say I am disapointed is an understatement. From the Boston Globe: ""George Lucas should watch The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers and hang his head in shame.""Enough said."
5,Exciting,Star Wars Episode 2 was great. If I could I would have given it more stars. It's a mix of a bunch of different types of movies.I have to admit that I thought Anakin (Hayden) was a COMPLETE hottie. Natalie was also good. The movie was exciting. But I'm axously awaiting ep. 3 because alot of people will die. Including Padme.(Everyone cries.) But Luke and Leia become apart of it.
1,Utter Garbage,"After hating the film in the theater, I thought I'd give it another try on DVD. Listening to the directors comments where Lucas actually tries to justify and admits that he ""really wanted"" the scene where Anakin and Padme roll around in the grass and ride on a cow thing, I couldnt take any more. Stick to the original 3 movies, this new era is chock full of fantastic special effects, but the story, acting, plot, etc are all terrible."
1,A shame,"The fact that Jar Jar Binx isn't in this movie is the ONLY saving grace.Shame on George Lucas for taking a great series and ruining it. All three movies need a story line, actors that can act, and characters that the watcher can care even a little bit about.It isn't all about special affects. A writer and director would be nice for these movies also."
4,And Who Was HIS Father ?,"We all know that Anakin will grow up to be Luke's father -- and it's evident from this episode that Anakin's father had to be Eddie Haskell. I've never seen such simpering, sniveling and self-justification in a character since a long time ago, on a TV network far, far away.P.S. It was neat to see Anakin get the Terminator's right arm, after his own was cut off in the sword fight."
3,.....SEND IN THE CLO[W]NES.......,"zoom! {YAWN!} zap! {YAWN!} boom! {YAWN!}Just a little disappointing with great homage to Fritz Lange and Ridley Scott ~ our heros are somewhere stuck in their Metropoli .... maybe [and really folks!] this one is just s a slight filler building up to the emergence of 'dear old Darth'; but nothing really happens except for the liason between Padme [Natalie Portman] and her boytoy Anni {Hayden Christensen at his pouty best}.Dear OLD Chris Lee seems to have stepped right off his ""Rings"" set. It's all very much Stanislavski meets Space [or lack of intelligent space].Tech Credits? OK - not as super as Episode I.Great love theme and shots of Lake Como ..... but Zeffirelli it sointenli ain't in the romance dept."
3,"As usual, the book was much better for the storyline...","As with Episode I, I read the book before seeing the movie. The book was much better at telling the story - the romantic part was explained much better, you got to see it progress, and it became much more believable. Granted, the special effects were great, but that's a given - would only be worth mentioning if they weren't. The movie only did a superficial job of telling what was happening. As usual, Lucas did his normal sub-par job of writing dialogue, and the same woodenness comes across in the actors that was present in episode I. Still a good flick, I'm a huge star wars fan, but I would've really been disappointed had I not read the book before seeing the movie. If you're a fan of the series, and want to know what really is happening in Episode II, buy the book - you won't be disappointed."
2,Star Wars?,"Ever date a girl (or boy) who was very pretty on the outside, but was empty inside and boring?Star Wars Episode II is like that. There are many pretty things flashing around, but it has no substance. Your average person can not give any credit to this movie. If you're a fan, and so hungry for star wars stuff that you'll accept anything Lucas throws out there, this is a treasure. This is an overbudget B-movie at best. All it has done for me, personally is to taint the magic the original series held for me as a child. I liked not knowing what the force was instead of being told in these new episodes that its some kind of disease in the blood.Like me, you'll watch it. You won't love it. It is pretty, but it is no one."
5,MUST SEE MOVIE!,"This was an awesome movie! I highly recommend it! It was much much better than the first The Phantom Menace. Hayden Christensen and Natalie Portman are wonderful. There chemistry is great! In the movie they just click. The best part of this movie is that Jar Jar Binks (the one we dread) is in it for about 3 minutes and thats IT hes gone. Yoda gets in on the action with a magnificent lightsaber fight towards the end but im not gonna say anything else cuz i dont wanna ruin the movie. So get off the couch, buy a ticket, and watch the BEST MOVIE OF THE YEAR! o yea hayden christensen (anakin skywalker) is hott just to let u no!"
1,Truly an embarrassment,"This movie felt like a high school production with an unlimited budget. Even the faithful in the theater found unintentional humor in the lifeless dialogue. The acting was not on the level of Episodes 4-6 (the only decent performance comes from a CGI-Yoda). Even the action scenes (usually Lucas's forte) were hard to follow and ridiculously over-crowded. This movie made me appreciate how truly great the first two movies were & especially how great Carrie Fisher, Harrison Ford and Alec Guinness were in their roles. I'm not sure I can totally blame the actors. Somebody quote me a memorable line of dialogue from this movie! Lucas badly needs a collaborator (not afraid to offer criticism) for Episode 3 or he should retire the franchise now with a little dignity. This is easily the weakest entry so far."
2,This moving gave me an Attack of the Boredom,"It's very simple, really. There are good films and there are bad films. Attack of the Clones falls squarely into the latter category. Clones is possibly the most boring and unoriginal science fiction movie ever made. Lucas has cribbed from a lot of sources over the years (most notably Camelot and the Arthurian Legends for the original Star Wars). But to enter into a car chase (a CAR CHASE people!) early in the film and to so blatantly rip off The Fifth Element is unconscionable.Anyone who can sit through Clones and not fall asleep (as I did in the theater) doesn't understand (and will never understand) what made the original Trilogy so much better than the ...George and Co. are turning out nowadays."
3,"Bad Script, Bad Acting... by FilmBoy /Jar-Jar Binks","A guy named Anakin (Hayden Christenson, bad actor) is 19. He goes to Padme's (Natalie Portman, another bad actor) apartment. She doesn't remember him very well. As the story unravels, they do stuff together and they kiss. Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor, good actor) goes to the planet Kamino and meets some Kaminoans who were making a clone army for the Jedis. He goes back to his planet. He, Anakin, and Padme get captured and are put out in an arena where monsters come to chomp 'em up. But... somehow, the clones come over and there is a battle. Who will win????This movie has a bad script, bad director, and bad acting. However, I thought the battle scene and spaceships were pretty cool. 4-99"
1,Hideous,"If I wanted to stare at the tv screen I believe it would be a better choice than watching this terrible continuation of Star Wars. The acting was almost sick, I have never seen such pitiful actors/actress' in my life. Haydene Christene and Natalie Portman portray their characters being in love as if they couldn't define their feelings. I re-call puppy love being more dramatic. To be apart of this movie I believe you would have to qualify for a role in a kindergarten play."
1,Where's the force?,"This movie is SO bad, which is a shame considering the talented cast. The story is dull and listless, and plays like an episode of Columbo in space (with all the lines being delivered in very wooden tones) . The original Star Wars movies (episodes 4, 5, and 6) were exciting and fun to watch. This movie, along with episode 1 is simply dull. Far too often the viewer is asking themselves, ""What happened to George Lucas' brain?"" I couldn't even bring myself to go to a theater to see this movie (after episode one being so bad, I wasn't going to fall for that again). I saw it when it appeared on HBO. At this rate, it will take extreme use of force to make me watch episode three...... this poor franchise, which started out so well, is being beaten further and further into the ground... unless you are a fanatical Star Wars fan, do not waste your time with this movie (even then, the fanatical will most likely be majorly disappointed as well)."
3,"Fun at times, but laughable love scenes","While Attack of the Clones is a much better film than its predecessor, this movie suffers from uninspired intimate scenes between Padme and Anakin. (The script is mostly to blame.)Thankfully, these scenes are are brief and tolerable. The rest of the film is filled with fantastic settings and of course jaw-dropping special effects. The focus of the movie is on Anakin as he reunites with Padme for another adventure. There are lots of action scenes from the ""city-planet"" of Coruscant, to the desert wastelands of Geonosis. No Star Wars fan will be disappointed (at least, not as much as Phantom Menace). Attack of the Clones is good clean fun."
4,My Review,"I'm a fan of the Star Wars movies, and I love the trilogy, but I was somewhat disappointed by Episode 2. It was way to much of a love story (which bored me), but for the story to make sense, I guess it had to be in there. The beginning of the Clone Wars part was awesome, and Jango Fett is cool too! (Why did he have to die?) You must see Yoda in action, as well as the other Jedi. If you are a fan of Star Wars, this movie is a must-have."
1,An honest question,"When the stench of a movie offends one's delicate nasal hairs, is it time to complain? Me thinketh this stinketh!"
2,Take your 20$ and see the two towers twice.,"I couldn't wait to see 1. I hoped 2 would be better. I don't really care to see 3. Everyone hypes about how great the Yoda scene is, or how cool Jango Fett vs Obi Wan was. Yeah, they were OK, but the movie was just not that good. Citizen Caine is a masterpiece, this was just Starship Troopers with lightsabers."
5,Another GREAT Star Wars film!,"The effects and sound were state-of-the-art & bone-chilling! The actors did a wonderful job, especially Hayden Christensen, who portrayed a young Darth Vader as well as could be done! The introduction of The Clone Wars, and hints of the Empire-to-come leave you craving for the conclusive Episode III, the final film which will bridge the gap between the prequal and the classic trilogy. Episode II surely redeemed the saga since Episode I and I can't wait for episode III!!!"
3,First Hour 2 - Second Hour 8!,"That's how I rated this film overall. If you can get through the first hour of this prequil, you will be pleasantly surprise by Master Yoda himself.The movie would have been much better for me if they would have recast Anakin Skywalker. That actor had no depth, wined all the time and just couldn't act. Fortunately he had Natalie Portman next to him that gave a stellar performace and for me - she acted for both of them. More credit to her.It was just long and slow for the first hour and fifteen minutes and then the action picked up. Once that did, Obiwan and Master Yoda rocked the screen. Very cool.Of course the movie is filled with Merchandise opportunites, but, guess what, that's why it was made. (Be real George.) Unfortunately for Star Wars fans, my belief is that SPiderman will do much, much better. It had a much more believable teen romance/relationship in it.I will give credit that Attack Of The Clones is much better then The Phantom Menance. Sorry again George!"
2,My Grade:D-,"Star Wars Episode II:Attack of the Clones(Widescreen Edition)Rated PG For Sustained Sequences of Sci-Fi Action/ViolenceStarring:Ewan McGregor And Natalie Portmen Director:George LucasLength:142 Minutes.Star Wars Episode 2 is probably one of the most boring movies I have ever seen. I don't like Sci-Fi Action Violence AT ALL!!!!!The only reason I am not giving this movie an F is because it cost a fortune to make those special effects so you got to give them credit for that. Star Wars Episode III Grade F. Episode 3 is the worst movie I have ever seen. Episode 3 was recevied a PG-13 rating for the intense situations of Sci-Fi Action Violence. And also for the graphic image of Anakin being burned up, but that was only a brief image. I would give the whole series and F."
1,"Better than Phantom Menace, worse than ""Anaconda"" or ""Spawn""","There are two types of people in this world: Those that liked ""The Matrix"" and those that didn't. If you loved ""The Matrix,"" you'll love ""Clones""- if you thought ""The Matrix"" was a flashy waste of time, you'll dislike ""Clones."""
2,A Movie That Proves...,...all the special effects and computer graphics in the world will never replace a good script and good acting. My hopes for Episode III are quickly diminishing.
4,"Not bad, considering","the stilted dialogue. But then, Lucas says that some of it is indeed corny and over-the-top. Let's all remember that GL made these movies with the old-time serials in mind. What is good about this movie is the development of the characters. You see both the good and bad in Anakin; you see Obi-Wan mature. These prequels weren't meant to be like the original trilogy; they are meant to lead up to episodes IV-VI and as such do a good job."
3,Still Pretty Disappointing,"""Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones,"" the first film to be shot entirely in digital, tells the story of Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen) and Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) as they attempt to protect Senator Padme' Amidala(Natalie Portman) from the evil Count Dooku (legendary actor Christoper Lee). The film has much to offer, both in characters and locations, which span from the water planet of Kamino to the windswept deserts of Geonosis, but is more focused on special effects than the fun and swashbuckling adventure of the original trilogy. Although it's better than Episode I, it's still pretty disappointing."
1,Digital Puppet Show,"Special effect wise this movie was much better than Episode1...Story and character wise the movie was far behind even Episode 1.Something must have happened in the last 2 decades that made George Lucas lose his human touch...the characters in the original trilogy all had their own personalities and characters...in the new movies it comes more and more through that all the ""real"" actors might have as well been replaced by digital puppets as they already act like those anyway.The only glimps of hope was Ewan McGregor who was refreshing by dropping a couple of cynical comments here and there...other than that the acting is just hidious and you can't even blame the actors for it...GL is so busy getting all those cool effects in place that the acting and story are not really his main focus.Even the digital Gollum in The Two Towers was a better actor then all the real life people in Episode 2....as a true StarWars fan I am very disappointed."
2,Not enough Action!!!,"I was very disappointed by this movie. It was the worst they have ever made. The only good part I won't give away because it's the only part you'll like. This was the most boring movie I've ever seen. It was so bad, I almost fell asleep in the middle of this movie. I am an action lover and this just didn't cut it. The romance level between whiny Anakin and Senator Amadala made me sick! These aren't supposed to be romantic movies, they are supposed to be adventurous. This movie made me decide to never see another Star Wars movie again."
2,O George Where Art Thou,"I saw this movie in the theater, and it was the first time that I have ever looked at my watch during any of the Star Wars movies. To bad it was only 20 minutes into the picture, but it felt like I had been there for 2 hours. What can I say about this movie; bad acting, bad love story, and the movie was way too long.I think George Lucas needs to stop listening to the hype surrounding him, and find someone else to write and edit your scripts. The dialog in this movie is terrible.I plan on buying this just to complete my collection, and then at least I can watch bits and pieces and watch it in 20 minutes :-).For something far better watch The Fellowship of the Rings."
1,George Lucas Must Be Imprisoned,"This borefest is a crime against humanity. George Lucas proves without doubt that he is a total lightweight and cannot direct actors to give a even slightly decent performance. The acting in this film is atrocious. The story is idiotic and only slightly interesting the way that other ""origin"" stories are.The scene where Anakin's mother dies? George Lucas gets life in prison.The scene with all the ""choppy crushy things"" (parodied BEFORE this movie in galaxy quest)? Double life sentence.Moronic love story - poorly acted, written, directed? George Lucas may need the [unltimate]penalty."
1,"My God, it was true","If you're like me and don't ""go to the movies"", but wait for the DVD, you've heard all the criticism of II's acting/script/plot. You probably said to yourself ""sure the critics don't like it...they hate anything Star Wars...maybe not George's best, but better than they say. AAAAAAGH!!!! They're right. Acting?!?!?!?! Worst!!!! Script?!?!?!?!?! Worst++++++ Plot?!?!?!? Let me know when you find it. The fact that every actor stunk tells me it was the direction. Regardless: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH!!!!"
2,An embarrassment to the original,"The best moment throughout the whole movie was when Yoda was fighting at the end. The rest was boring and had almost no action whatsoever. The computer graphics are amazing but the story is less than satisfactory. If it wasn't for the lifelike graphics, i would've given it 1 star."
3,5-2=3,"5 stars - 1 for crappy diolog - 1 for at least a whole hour of boring footage.lets face it. the diolog in this movie was corny and predictable. The whole Anikan love thing is just messed up and is extreamly boring to watch. this movie would be an easy 5 out of 5 if the script was better (george lucas, u cant write. face it. let someone with talent write the script) and the love thing was cut a lot shorter (it covers a whole f***ing hour of the movie! what a waste).besides those two problems this was a good movie, and the yoda battle was awsome. but this still has to be the weakest of all the star wars films, next to the phantom menace.peace out."
2,I couldn't tell the difference between this and dumb and dum,"Oh yeah, dumb and dumber was supoosed to be funny. I'm a huge huge fan of Star Wars. But why I bought this after having already seen and hated it is quite beyond me. Probably for references, but boy oh, this movie sucked. No Jar Jar, no Luke, no effects (just love scene crap), so what is this movie good for?"
5,This wuz a awesome moovee!,"This movie(Which i now own) iz da' Bom. the Massive fighting scene wuz kewl. Butt the best part wuz wen Yoda wuz all jumpin' around ..., it wuz amazing, this film really made me kry it wuz so good."
4,Lucas does it again!,"This ain't a bad episode towards this heroing saga. There was plenty of battle scenes and lots of lightsaber duels, my favourite was when Anakin was dueling it out with Dooku with both sabers. The only thing I did not like about this movie were those mindless droids (""Roger, roger!"") that were no match for Anakin or Obi-Wan's Jedi skills. I thought that Hayden's acting in this movie was convincing.This movie might not be liked by all Star Wars fans, but I still found it a good movie to the collection.Below are my ratings for these actors:Hayden Christiensen: 3/5Ewan McGregor: 4/5Natalie Portman: 4/5Ian McDiermad 3/5Anthony Daniels 2/5Ahmed Best (Jar Jar) 1/5Christopher Lee 3/5"
2,How bad could this get,"star Wars Attack of the Clones was really dissapointing. I went to go see it in movie theaters when it first came out. I think Star Wars nation was pretty upset about this one. The worst thing about ti was it seemed more like a romance then anything. Anakin cryed like a baby the whole stinkin time and he was very inmature and just so annoying. I gave it two stars because I am a Star Wars fan, it was good in sourround sound, and the last thirty minutes was actually decent. I'm sorry I have to critisice this product so much. Just buy it because it is part of the Star Wars saga. Besides that this was just a poor effort by a great director who is George Lucas. God bless you and have a wonderful day and make sure you go see a good Star Wars movie that is out right now which is Episode three Revenge of the Sith."
3,once again another poor film,"horrible acting (anakin, padme, mace, et al) with only a few good performances (obi-wan, palpatine). midi-chlorians? rubbish. the force is weak with this film.some good jedi action at the end bumps this up from 2 to 3 stars."
2,A Phantom Menace Clone,"I was disappointed with Attack of the Clones. It was barely better than Phantom Menace. Once again the movie relied heavily on special effects and the plot was weak. In the 2nd edition of the trilogy, the Republic is faced with a new separatist movement. Amidala once a queen is now a senator and has become a target of assassins. Both Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin are called to protect her. It has been 10 years since both Amidala and Anakin have seen each other. Once they see each other the romance begins. I found the chemistry between Amidala and Anakin was poor at best. The movie moves along at a slow pace. The special effects are once again incredible, but I fear Lucas has relied on them too much. The only bright spot in the movie was that Jar Jar Binks was reduced to cameo performance."
1,blah,"The only reason why I can see someone actaully liking this movie is if they really like the special effects and if they really really like Luke from the ""first"" movies, where he whined insesantly, and basically was just plain iritating...his father shows you where he gets it from. I'd give this no stars if I could...I tell you though, this and episode one make me fear the next movie and the Indiana Jones movie Lucas is thinking about doing...*shudders* Nothing like having your favorite movie franchises from Childhood ..."
5,SWE2,I just saw this movie a few days ago. I was afraid that I was gonna be dissapointed but I was far from dissapointed. This movie is one of the greatest movies I have ever seen. The only movie that is better is The Empire Strikes Back. I can't belive I took so long to watch this beautiful movie. This is a classic. Now I can't wait For Episode 3.
3,Blame it on Joseph Campbell,"... Bill Moyers didn't help much, either. That whole ""Power of the Myth"" thing has gotten out of hand and all the praise has turned Lucas's creative talents to gruel.Back before the attack of the prequels I'd never have dreamed that Lucas would deliver up a whiny, angst-ridden Darth Vader. Never thought I'd be watching the clock and waiting for some excitement, either. Someone needs to put some air back into The Franchise."
2,The Emperor has no clothes,"A dismal failure on almost every level imaginable. Even the eye-popping special FX in this film aren't enough to overcome the threadbare plot, terrible acting, zero chemistry between the romantic leads, and a mind-bogglingly bad script (which may contain the worst dialogue in cinema history, including anything by Edward D. Wood Jr.). When I saw this in the theater, the audience was literally rolling on the floor laughing during the romantic scenes, and bored during much of the rest. The only way to view this movie is as an unintentional comedy suitable for MST3K treatment."
4,A true Star Wars fan,"I was 9 when ""A new Hope"" was released and I have been a Star Wars fan every since. I saw everyone in the theater and also read all the books in the Star wars series. I got exactly what I expected, Attack of the clones was ment to be the story that brought the past and the future together and that's exactly what it does. It tells a lot of the unexplained story from the prequels and ties it all together with music from ""Phantom menace"" mixed with ""Empire strikes back"". I highly recommend this movie to everyone, but my advice is watch the other 4 movies first to get the most out of the story. I'm just sorry I have to wait 3 years for the next one. It's worth the money, I already saw it 3 times."
3,"Better than the reviews led me to believe, but still...","To begin with Episode II certainly isn't at the same level of quality than the original trilogy, but that may be an unfair standard to live up to. On its own Episode II is not bad SF. The special effects are excellent. The landscapes and backgrounds are great as well.The film's weakest moments are its concentration on romance. Most of us don't go to a Star Wars movie looking for romantic storylines.I'd recommend Episode II to anyone who enjoys the Star Wars franchise but I'd warn them that it's not up to the quality of the original trilogy. That and I'd recommend keeping your finger on the fast forward."
2,What a failure.,"I am a star wars fan but I just don't like this movie (and Star Wars I either). The acting is phony, the dialogue is stiff and simplistic and the movie looks like a continuos computer animation sequence. Digital generated special effects just are not good and they all look alike (you can spot them right away). Overall: TERRIBLE and did I mention boring?. Stick with the original trilogy."
2,dumb and confusing,"OK, so this is a grown up point of view, adn it may be too much to expect that the producers can satisfy kid AND adults, even adults weaned on star trek. BUT REALLY -- the young actors were very unskilled, Anakin mostly seemed like he was embarrased by his lines (a reasonable response) and to be fair, is probably much too young to carry a transition from good guy to bad guy at all convincingly (he could have used some help from the writers). The plot was probably there before the left most of it on the cutting room floor.The force is hardly ever talked of or used, and Yoda at one point alludes to the diminishing power of the Jedi -- this would have made a great plot element, whay was it not developed?Over all, too many special effects, too little story."
2,Pretty bad!,"I cant remember if it was here or elsewhere that I gave Star Wars Episode 1 a one star review or whatever. I do know that Ep1 was one of the WORST dissapointments in a movie in my entire life.Obi-Wan is the only person with tallent in the entire movie. I feel that the movie was based too much on politics and there wasn't enough action until the last fourty minutes or so. If you are a star wars geek (UNLIKE me) you will have to get this because you're a star wars geek! If you are like me and just get good movies, then skip on this. The only real reason that I upped this rating a knotch is because of Patame's (Natale Portman's) GREAT looks."
3,My favorite High School play,"The whole movie is like watching a high school play with really cool special effects. Sets up for the next movie very well, but the only reason IV, V, and VI were good was due to the chemistry between the characters. Here, there are no characters, just high schoolers."
1,blah!! this really sucked!,"This was worse than Phantom Menace. This film had no spirit to it whatsoever. The acting was horrible, the plot didn't flow, the dialog was shallow, the action scenes were senseless and overly gawdy, and Yoda's light saber scene was a joke. The only thing memorable about this movie was the scene where Anakin finds his captive mother. I can't really remember much anything else. There should have been more of the scene where Anakin proceeds to slaughter the tribe that captured his mother.It's a darnshame, but this series has really gone downhill. I am not looking forward to Episode 3."
1,Horribly disapointed,"Ratings:1. Special Effects=102. Directing=23. Plot=34. Acting=4Hmmm....well, at least it was visually stunning. I think to stand out these days, you need to have a good plot and at least decent acting. The audience has to care about the characters and what will happen to them (Basic movie requirement). None of this is present here. There are already a ton of movies with special effects, so standing on that alone just doesn't cut it.In the future, Lucas can be head of special effects, but that's about it!And please, use the acting talent available!"
1,Star Wars Episode II,"The system does not allow the option of selecting no star, so I am forced to give one to this HD video. So far the more parts there are of a movie the worse it gets, and unfortunately this is also true for the Star Wars saga.Episode two even more then Episode one seriously suffers from lack of story. The attempt to give the multiple action CGI sequences credibility through the construction of an incomplete political back story fails entirely. The reasons for the featured clone war are barely apparent, and the lack of a real antagonist in both new episodes does not make it easier to detect a story line. Maybe part three will make greater sense, once Anakin turns into Lord Vader, even though there is little hope."
1,"NOT ""Like New""","Star Wars II was advertised as ""like new"". This is the first ""like new"" item that I have purchased through Amazon that was not as expected. The first Disk has a few slow points, and it is a little fuzzy sometimes. The 2nd disk (special features) was virtually un-watchable; it stalled and could not be fast forwarded or replayed. Both disks were well worn: not at all ""like new"". I would classify this DVD as Fair. I do not watch Special Features on DVDs often, but I like to view them at least once. If I don't get a better replacement, I will stick with this one so that I have the Star Wars set complete. I ordered another DVD from this supplier, but I have not watched it yet--it does look very well worn, too."
2,Special effects can never save a bad movie.,"I saw this movie shortly after it was released, and even though I was starved for entertainment, this failed to satisfy. In all fairness, the special effects were great, but the movie was severely hampered by poor dialouge, and an even more moronic story. To my great fortune, I've only had to endure viewing this bomb twice (not by choice), but I urge anybody that was a fan of the original not to waste hard earned cash on this sorry excuse of a movie."
1,the only thing i liked about this film was christopher lee,christopher lee's tall ominous performence of count dukoo was the only thing good about an other wise stupid film. though i doubt the old man could have done all the stunts without a double. the rest of the film is really bad acting by natalie portman and a sappy romantic subplot that makes me want to vomit. I HATE this CGI binge that lucas has been taking since episode one. cant lucas make a good film! why he is such a 'famous' director makes me wonder
2,Not alone in opinion,I just recently saw Episode II and can't tell you how disappointed I was. I decided to read reviews and find that I'm not the only one. It was completely lacking passion. Especially the scenes with Anakin & Amidala. It felt very forced. I didn't feel that a connection was made with the audience.
1,What in the Universe happened to Star Wars?,"Star Wars is not what it used to be. In the good old Star Wars days there were intesting characters like Hon Solo: Greedy and still a hero. The dialogue was snappy, but it didn't sound like something from a seventy five scent joke book? Remember the action? The actors actually looked like they were fighting their opponents not square dancing with their lightsabers. R2D2 used to be more than a tin can on wheels; he had what I call a personality. The story was a little cliché in places; but it wasn't down right corny. For the most part it was fast paced: bang, bang, bang. Now it's slow as Yoda with a broken leg. The characters used to be charasmatic, all out guys not bums that walked on stage and said, ""Yeah, yeah, no, I thought so, can I shout myself in the butt now?"" It used to be funny without begging, crying, and scratching for laughs with stupid characters and ridiculous situations. Star Wars used to be fun without being Barney."
4,Anakin,"When the movie first came out I was sooo excited I didn't realize Anakin was such a whiner!!! Now that I've watched it more objectively I find Anakin really annoying! Jesus, this is supposed to be the future Darth Vader!!! I'm knocking off a star because of whiny Ani! The movie is still worth it, specially the Yoda fight sequence. For all fans that want a little extra from this DVD go to options (on disk one), press 11 <enter> 3 <enter> and 8 <enter>, you'll be able to see the hidden movie bloopers from there (Also available in Episode I), just tell your kids you're in tune with the force and that's how you found it."
2,It's okay!,"If you're really into Star Wars, then this is a must have to complete the entire set for when the 3rd one comes out. However, this isn't the best film in my opinion. I think that the original 4,5,and 6 were better than the new 1 and 2. I think that there's WAY TOO MUCH SPECIAL EFFECTS!!! Before in the originals, there were special effects, but they were more ""home movie"" kind of special effects. In this movie, I can't think of many scenes where there isn't something that's digitally animated. Now, that's good for LOTR and Matrix, but I think we should get back to the ""home movie"" kind of special effects. Other wise, this film is OKAY, I guess."
4,Second best of the Star Wars films.,"Fine and Much better follow up to The Phantom Menace plants the seeds of what is to come but lacks the conviction to take it forward to where it should be. It needed to be darker, and the love story needed more to make people believed that they were really in love. The script needed work as well, and I think a good rewrite could have been ordered if they took a little more time with what they were trying to do.I will say that its probably the best entry in the saga since ""Empire"" but it lacks that film's conviction to take it all the way home."
5,Finally,Well this is the movie that Episode 1 should have been. After all the dissapointment with the first one finally something we fans can really enjoy. Even though the story lacks some depth and stuff. But the original ones did also. And Yoda fighting is just unbelieveble
2,For fans only!!,"Seen this one to see what all the fuss is about and the best thing I can say is that the action scenes are good,but the talking scenes are just plain boring!!So slow....I prefer the first 3 orginal ones with Harrison Ford than the prequels.."
5,Episode II,e II anakin and padme fall in love and getmarried and horror legend christopher lee is playing a bad guy namedcount dooku and if you liked boba fett your gonna love his fatherjango fett and I know much more than that but I can't tell you but Ican tell you that it will be much better than episode I because it'smore like the oringinal trilogy and you can bet your bottom dollarthat I will be there the first day it comes out.
2,A second helping of crap.,"This film was more exciteing to some degree than the first, but again we get a cast of actors that has no chemestry and further more they look out of place in all the CGI meshing. This film was just another second helping of crap. Thank god Star Wars: The Clone Wars is out there to give Star Wars a good name, because these first 2 movies just make it all look like utter crap."
2,"Good, Not Great","This movie has amazing visual effects, a beautiful score and imagination to spare. What it oh so disappointingly lacks is good acting. Natalie Portman is so painfully wooden...Lucas had better spend a lot of time rehearsing the actors on third one. It's funny, watching all the DVD features, it is so obvious Lucas has no interest in or respect for the acting process. This is why this movie and its prequel will be easily forgotten once the digital tools are put in the hands of someone who actually cares about actors as well. Like Peter Jackson. George Lucas is out of touch."
2,"Very wooden, stiff acting","Just goes to show that no matter how many millions you spend on special effects, it doesn't add up to diddly squat if the acting isn't good.Where did they find this hayden christensen? a boy-band audition? Somebody send him to an acting class, please.I saw Episode II in the theaters on opening night, and people were actually laughing out loud at scenes that were meant to be dramatic because the acting was so silly.This movie is overall very average, felt like I was watching a cartoon."
1,Stellar Disappointment,"What can I say. More importantly, how can I express my disappointment and do so kindly. George Lucas has lost sight with his most recent addition to the Star Wars saga. What was once a franchise predicated upon classic story telling, has been reduced to a mixed bag of overly embellished special effects. Wasn't it Mr. Lucas that stated that ""A special effect without a story was a pretty boring thing""? Well George, it is time to start practicing what you preach. My suggestion! Put the laser blasters, and political overtones to bed. This franchise was perfect just the way that it was. Afterall, anything worth doing is worth doing right. Neither Episode I or II even come close to doing that."
2,"Great Special Effects, but George Can't Direct....","This is a technically great movie, and it is KNOWN that the actors can act, but Lucas is sadly lacking in his Directoral abilities. Poor Pacing, Flat Acting, and built up expectations really make you wish this was a much better movie than it turned out to be.Where are the memorable Lines? All three of the first Star Wars movies had great one liners, LOTS of them. You'd be hard pressed to get more than a handful of good ones from Menace and Clones.George was out of the driver's seat for too long and it shows. Maybe he should have warmed up with something else before he tried to continue his epic."
2,Pass on it,"I too am a big fan of Star Wars however not a fanatical one that will say anything is great no matter how crummy. The love scenes were like a page from a bad romance novel..they should have been discreet and the dialogue less sappy. Also Hayden Christenson was only ok as Anakin, he seemed unable to truly portray the passion and conflict Anakin would have experienced. Admit it..the scene where he was having a nightmare was the worst acting you have seen.The audience would laugh at many points during the movie where you weren't supposed to laugh. The fight scene at the end barely saved it and even then it was inferior to the fight scene in Phantom Menace. We knew things were going downhill when they ""redid"" the originals and not in a good way. I still have high hopes for the third movie but Attack of the Clones is the weakest out of the entire Star Wars series."
2,What a stinker. No chemistry between the stars.,"...AND PLEASE...Someone tell me what is the purpose for SAMUEL L. JACKSON?? All he does is walk around ""looking concerned"", but I can't quite figure out WHO or WHAT he adds to these films. The original trilogy with outdated special effects are classic. These modern day versions with great sfx will easily be forgotten. Yoda is the only good part."
2,"Better than Episode One,But still just isn't Stars Wars like","Its better than Episode One,but its still boring as the first one."
2,2.5 Stars...,"Episode 2 is the worse Stars Wars movie to date. The plot was fine but the acting was terrible. John Lucas has a huge budget to work with and could have put together a better Skywalker. That guy fits perfect on the daily ""Soaps"""
4,Mindless Etertainment,"My biggest problem with the new Star Wars trilogy is its lack of freshness;... The original Star Wars trilogy is the best story ever put on film, and what sets the original apart from this new trilogy, is story and character depth.Episode I and II has special effects and action to spare, and the climatic light saber dual in Episode II between Obi-Wan, Anakin and Count Dooku and Yoda (!) is quite impressive, it's just that the rest of the film is not, however fans of the trilogy won't be disappointed."
1,Unbelievable,"And i thought it couldn't get any worse than ""The Phantom Menace."" Boy, was I wrong! ... In Attack of the Clones, Lucas emphasises Anakin's rebellious streak in the most tactless, overdone way imagineable. I mean, the [guy] has to argue and ""rebel"" about everything, as if the audience would not realise the future Vader's personality unless there were arguments between Kenobi and Anakin in practically every scene..."
1,deserving of Razzies nomination,"I trully believe this is one of the worst film of the year! I thought the acting was atrocious, plot deplorable, directing a joke. I don't really get the fanfare and the spin."
1,The [end] of a classic saga,"I was only young when I first began my Star Wars fascination. The movies, the toys, the products; you name it I've probably owned it at one time or another. However as big a fan as I am it really kills me to see what they've turned this once larger than life saga into. They turned a grand story into a background item for the sake of showcasing technology. The whole driving force behind the original Star Wars movies was a gripping well told story, this new chapter of the epic continues on the downward spiral of episode I. Bad acting + secondary story = bad movie. I wanted to like this movie, I just couldn't. Yes its the first completely digital movie but that doesn't improve on the movie itself, it just means that you can have a crystal clear view of the bad acting... steer clear from this stinker and lets hope that when they make episode III that they remember what made the first movies in the series so memorable."
2,Attack of the Clones-All Flash no Body,Just saw Star Wars Attack of the Clones and I am terribly sadly disappointed. Yes it was visually stunning but then it wasn't really anything sci-fi fans haven't seen before. No new ground just lots more of it. What really got me was how boring the dialog and the love story were. Everytime Padmae and Anikin were on screen talking about falling in love or talking about not falling in love time just stood still and went on forever. These people were not acting they were reading and reading badly.Yes all you geeked out Star Wars fans will love the movie and see it twice Im sure but anyone with a lil detachment to the whole Star Wars thing will be gravely disappointed. Sorry George better luck next time.
1,Attscking my cloned clever catch phrase,"I put more thought into the title than Lucas did ""Clones."" Crappy dialogue, crappy acting, whining Anakin, (I want my moommmy...) cheesy attempts at cuteness, I could go on and on, but I won't. The movie isn't worth that. I loved the original Star Wars flicks, even Episode I (The Pahntom Menace, bum bum bum) was great, with new and exciting things. This is just all that stuff over and over again. The ONLY segments of this film that are wirth the price of the film it's printed on are the spectacular Yoda-Fight-Scene, (Though slightly MNatrixised)and McGregors line about Death sticks. Do yourself a favor, see LotR, SPider-Man, ANYthing but this"
1,When a child keeps saying they need to go to the bathroom,"during a film, you know there's something wrong. Fortunately for Lucas, this film wasn't released the same year as Battleship Earth, otherwise that film would have had a serious contender for the Turkey of the year awards. God - I've NEVER been so bored !!! Went with a friend, and we both said that if we'd been sitting at the end of the aisle, we'd have left after 20-30 minutes. I'm trying to remember if there were any film cliches they left out - from Anikin rescuing his mother, her managing to make her dying speech and then snuffing it to one of the Jedi being killed SO easily (where did the force go ?) by the bounty hunter, who then proceeds to perform a wild western twirling of his gun, before returning it to its holster.Aaaaaarrrrrggggggghhhhh - DREADFUL."
3,Yoda keeps this one alive,"from beginning to the end is a good old time and the theater sound was great. though theres some characters in here that are bad at acting and some of the scenes are stupid but the Yoda kicking ass scene is the highlight and also the fight between Obi Wan Kenobi and Jango Fett. the darkside is getting close to AnakinSkywalker and soon Luke and Leia will be born but we all know what happens when he turns bad, basically everyone on the planet except for babies or foriegn people."
1,"Outclassed by ""Lord of the Rings""","I really wanted this movie to be great (everyone did). But I was extremely disappointed to find the acting subpar (what a waste of talent!). Mcgregor and Jackson essentially did nothing! It was boring in parts, and yoda fighting was just comical. The CGI were good.To be frank, The Lord of the Rings was everything I expected this movie to be-great plot, sense of evil, great effects, true emotion. The romance in clones was pretty wooden.So I will not purchase this dvd, but I already bought Lord of the Rings. Call me a convert."
4,It's the only one of this trilogy I can tolerate,"I don't like the first movie, the Phantom Menace, because I felt it really was a kids movie, because of the kid, Jake Lloyd in the movie and Jar Jar Binx. Revenge of The Sith was just to sad for me and after watching it one time knew I would not be watching it again.Attack of the Clones is the best of the three for me. My only real fault with the movie is Hayden Christensen. His acting tended to take me out of the movie. Best of the three but not exactly a glowing endorsement."
1,No movie in the box,"Big star wars fan and seemed to be missing this movie from my collection. Unfortunately still missing from my collection. Item sent only had the movie extras dvd, no movie. Very disappointing when you sit down to watch a movie that is not there. Had the cheek to charge me shipping costs for an item they messed up.Any more of this and I will quit amazon."
5,"Star Wars- Episode II, Attack of the clones","My son and I love the movie. It came fast and just as described, and at a fraction of the price. Great transaction. Thx!"
4,Better than the first,"The best out of the three 'prequels', the storyline is more interesting and goes somewhere after the boredom of the first. Hayden Christianson brings a freshness to the screen and shares a good chemistry with Natalie Portman. Specoial FX and bonus features are once again outstanding."
2,Attack of the Cornballs,"This movie is all about effects. Great ones at that. The story is not up to par against any of the original Star Wars movies. THe acting was horrible to say the least. Hayden Christiansen was the worst actor of the bunch. The very unbelieveable""love"" story was so painful to watch it made me almost embarrassed for the poor kid. With 2 misses in the Star Wars prequil, I dont expect much of the 3rd installment. I'll stick to watching the much better original Star Wars series on DVD."
2,Darth was a crybaby?,"I don't know where to begin, but this movie sucked! Lucas should be ashmed of himself. Some of the story is good, but whenever young Darth was in a scene it made me want to wretch. No way Darth was this much of a bizatch.It's bad enough that 3PO and R2 are in these's movies, but do we need all the stupidly obvoius one liners from 3PO? Damn that was retarded.I could go on and on, but I'll spare you all. This is a classic example of a perfectly good story being f'ed up to make 8 year olds laugh.I will say the special effects were great and the story does leave it open for a great III. I hope Lucas won't crap the bed, cause I love the Star Wars..maybe too much.."
1,stupid,"It was too sappy, hardly any action or comedy, at that. I don't understand how it was the great CLONE wars, because to me it looked like a bunch of Jedis fighting robts for about 10 minutes. The rest was dumb."
3,Come On!,"I a huge Star Wars fan thanks to Hayden the guy that played Anakin. I don't know maybe I love him or something. I think that this movie could have been done so much better, with the characters saying more moving things. Instead they said words like ""This party is over!"" or ""I wish that I could wish away my feelings"" this is not what you say in a movie that take place out in space. There could have been more parts where Anakin actually took a stand toward his master. It just seen like Anakin was nothing but a mopping kid that wanted his way. there could have been stronger action and the scene where Anakin killed the Tuskein radiers could have been longer, we need to be able to sense that Anakin is going to become evil. There was so much wrong with this movie that I feel that Lucas is going to have to make up for it in the last and final movie."
2,Disappointing movie,"Being a die-hard Star Wars fan, I was very disappointed with this film solely because of the acting. Christopher Lee and Ewan McGregor were the two bright spots in the movie, but Hayden Christensen was horrible. I know that he's portraying the downfall of the main character, but I was very disappointed. As far as Natalie Portman and Samuel L. Jackson, I feel that they could have replaced them both with cardboard cutouts. The acting on both parts was just plain flat.I enjoyed the action scenes (I laughed out loud during Yoda's lightsaber battle) but I cringed everytime Anakin and Padme were on the screen."
4,A DVD for Hard Core Star Wars fans,My seven year old loves it. The Battle of Geonosis is a experience through a stereo. The deleted scenes are quite interesting.
2,I missed Mr.Deeds for this one,"I was so bored,Anikan was so stoic,the Senator seemed so disinterested, the dialogue was monotone at best.There wasno chemistry between these two so -called lovers.Actually themovie was going on and off to add to the insult.Special effects were amazing and looked like my kids video games.The plot madeit seem like there were three or four good movies that could have been developed somewhere.Otherwise the story line ,for me,was a little hard to follow,there was no levity to ease thetension of Anikans deadpan performance.1 star for the movie and 1 star for special effects,a real snoozer"
2,Better then the Phantom Menace but hardly a good movie,George Lucas seems to have a hard time writing a story. This Movie is better then the first but anything would have been better then the first. While it's interesting in parts it could have been so much better. A shame .
2,"Learn to write, George....","Despite the marvelous entertainment, action, fight scenes and outstanding special effects, this movie is ultimately a dud. Mr Lucas has spent so much time and effort on the background (special effects) that he has forgotten the most important thing, the foreground. This is the reason movies should be made in the first place - captivating plot, good acting, good storyline.Almost everyone I know that has seen this movie has thoroughly enjoyed the action scenes, but they have cringed at some of the disgraceful acting and scriptwriting. When I saw this people were laughing in the cinema at the supposedly serious scenes between Anakin and Amidala.I'm sorry to say it. I wanted so much more than the lowest common denominator for this movie. This script is a travesty."
1,NO!,"The Star Wars triology was one of the best set of movies I've ever seen, but these two POS movies that were absolutly horrible! 99% digitial [junk] I like the old cheesy master peice with good plots and ACTORS. I like my charaters to live, not some cartoon! this is basically a cartoon, but even toy story was a way better cartoon then this!..."
2,What have they done?!,"As someone who went to the theater to see the original Star Wars probably 10 times, I have grown up loving these movies. But this one I couldn't even sit through!!!The plot is incredibly convoluted and while the effects are interesting, I couldn't get past how many of the characters were so obviously computer-generated. What was wrong with the good old days of intricate costumes? Give me the cantina scene in the original Star Wars over this stuff any day.The kid who plays Anakin is a horrible actor and all of the scenes between him and Natalie Portman just seemed so stiff and uncomfortable. There is no chemistry between them at all.Oh, and when R2-D2 turned on his jet packs and flew... I had to leave the room. Since when can R2-D2 fly? Ugh...."
4,unbiased truth,"the story was slow at first. fans knew something was going to happen and wanted something to happen, but it took too long for the ending to be revealed. the last 20 minutes made the movie. if the movie storyline was replacded with 20 more minutes of the clone battle, this movie would have been the best of all star wars films"
5,A visual feast,"Attack of the Clones was everything I expected it to be. A visual feast, creating spectacular worlds to journey through. It is true that the computer generated graphics gives the director much more freedom to create these worlds, but, computers cannot create worlds; only a glorious imagination can. I loved every minute of it; especially Yodas fight with Dooku. Ok, the plot is nothing new, and some of the scenes of Padme and Anakin are a bit soppy; and yes, the clone war gets a bit too war-like; also lacking are the space combat scenes. But altogether, a great movie. Buy this DVD if you are a Star Wars fan - it is a must-have. Anyway, if you are truly a Star Wars fan, you dont have to be told - you would buy it anyway."
2,bad darth vader,"you all know it. hayden christensen is not a good darth vader! vader is sooo badass, and christensen is more like an american idol. george lucas once again proves that he doesn't really care about the story or characters, he just once to modernize his movies with ""better"" special effects, and younger better looking actors. just like all the horror remakes coming out. you think you can better your stories because technology is better, well you are just screwing the hell out of it, and making the old ones look bad."
1,Don't hate George...just feel better when he doesn't direct,"Mr. Lucas, character does matter. I'm not talkin Henry Jaglom here...but it's hard to sink your teeth into cardboard. Stop reading Joseph Campbell...and get to understanding the psychology of character ...A self conscious attempt at myth is junk, hence this film."
1,What a waste!,A disappointing effort. The acting in this film is pitiful! The effects are OK. Won't be seeing the last sequel.
1,Star Wars episode II [VHS],Seriously? A video cassette without a cover with an added bonus a broken flap. I should have put forth the energy finding one at the goodwill.
3,Okay Movie,This movie is an okay movie but nothing special about it. The special effects weren't as good as I thought they were going to be and I saw them in both the Digital and regular screens. The acting was horrible especially the love scene between Anakin and Senator Amidala. I also found out that Yoda was digitized and I don't like that I like Yoda in his original form as a puppet. Anyways this movie is a fine watch but don't think anything highly of it or you will be disappointed.
4,Star Wars II,"As always, a piece of technological art and heavy attention to detail. I found, of course, some parts (story line) unbelievable and wanting. But, again, it is Star Wars. It is fun."
2,Okay... it was bad,"I am a big fan of star wars, call me crazy if you want, but this movie was just plain bad. It's to hard to follow the plot you just sort of try to jump in now and then. This is a big disapointment, I am wondering how episode three will turn out. And, hey, thats a big part of the tie between the Anikan trilogy and the Luke triology."
4,In the beginning.....,"I found this film to be quite good. I know that others have panned it, but it really hit the spot for me. What I liked was that the film set the stage for the other versions which followed it (Star Wars, The Empire Strikes Back, and Return of the Jedi). We learn about the history of the Clone Wars, the Skywalkers, Obi Won, Yoda, the Emperor. No Darth Vader yet, but we know he'll show up in Star Wars 3. We meet she who will become the mother of Princess Leia and Luke Skywalker, and encounter the two droids. I really enjoyed the movie, but the only thing that I'd find fault with is that there seemed to be too much in the way of computer generated effects... I almost thought I was watching a cartoon at times."
2,"It was better than Phantom Menace, sort of","Goerge Lucas, in his latest effort to divorce you from your money, has produced a piece of...work...that lacks orginality, spontaneity, acting, direction and story. There is nothing new in here except the special effects.As I was enduring this movie, I was constantly checking my watch hpoing for light at the end of the tunnel."
1,What were they thinking?,"This movie has some of the cheesiest melodramatic flop that I've ever seen, along with a pretty boy who pretends to be an actor, and badly at that. To call the scriptwriting and acting juvenile would be an insult to twelve year olds everywhere."
2,"Beatiful scenery, but lacks a sense of adventure","Unfortunately it lacked a sense of adventure despite the definite beauty in the advance in digital technology. The high point of movie was (undoubtedly) fight scene of Jedi Master ""Yoda"" and ""Count Dooku""."
2,"George Lucas,give us something better in storyline!","A.I. the movie would've been a better storyline for 'Episode I',and Anakin Skywalker should've been the innovator and creator of the 'Jedi Class',instead of a follower. The fight scenes between Count Dooku and Anakin Skywalker with double light saber should've been stretched to 5 minutes longer. The camino should've been game and model builders who reconstructed armies from the past,in plain english,'Gamers'. George Lucas,lacks imagination with these two last episodes,don't disappoint us again,which you probably will."
3,No Widescreen version,"How is possible that a great movie, part of the Star Wars saga is presented in a full screen format in DVD? There is nothing more to say about the movie, but I'm not buying this until the anamorphic Widescreen version comes out, as in Europe"
1,"I seen it, Thats all can say","What a big disapointment. Lucus has not lived up to his standards. The movie is to love dramatic. My kids said they didn't like it at all. I found it hard to stay interested in the movie. I wanted more battles and action. The movie wonders to much from actor to actor. My wife took the kids and bought tickets to go watch Scooby Do. I have never got up from a Star Wars movie to get a drink, but I got up twice during this one. I wanted to see some of those great galatic battels. The whole movie seems to centered about love. The battle at the end between the Colnes and the Robots does not save the Movie. Yoda can hardly walk and he fight with his Light Saber like he from the Matrix. Technology does not help this movie. It has killed the feeling that the sceans are real. I would not recommend taking young children to this movie or yourself"
2,Attack of the zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz's,"I am a fan of the original Star Wars trilogy, but somehow George Lucas has forgotten how to tell a great story in the years that have passed since Return of The Jedi. Personally, I think he should have picked up the series with episode 7 and not gone back to episode 1. Lets face it, we all ready know how these are going to turn out, so where is the suspense, and if he had picked up with episode 7, not only would the stories be fresh, he could of had some of the old characters, at least in cameos. Attack of The Clones is not a terrible movie, it is certainly better than episode 1, and the special effects are terrific, but the dialogue is laughable at times, and does anyone really care about any of these characters? It is sad to think how great this series could have been compared to how it is turning out."
3,"Not What Everyone Wants, But Good Enough","Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones wasn,t as outstanding as the first three Star Wars movies released, but it was exciting enough to get you to enjoy it's light saber/laser-sooting/force-using scenes throughout the movie. Yeah, seeing Yoda fight was cool, but the movie just didn't have the special ability to awe audiences the way it used to.The good parts of the movie were that the movie was easier to follow and they took better camera views for the scens which made the movie one of the top-sellers. Like I said, the movie was good, but not as good as one could have hoped for. If you want a movie that you'll want to watch over and over again, this movie just isn't the perfect movie for you."
2,AAAAHHH!!!! IT BURNS!!!!,"Geez! Talk about downhill! Episode I was good, and even the original trilogy wasn't bad, but this...This just isn't fair! When I walked into that movie theater, I was all prepared for droids' heads getting chopped off and whirling lightsabers, not mushy goo-goo kissy stuff. It was disgusting! I mean, excuse me for noticing, but even if a Star Wars movie had romance, it didn't dominate the movie. The only decent parts were the execution and the part where Yoda kicks butt. Other than that, this movie stunk. So, for all you kids who hate romance, avoid this movie like the plague. Save yourselves!"
5,Great Movie,"The episode II DVD is worth buying. The quality of the picture is by far the best available(extremly crisp and colorful).There is hours of bonus material on Disk 2. Although the movie has been criticized by many, I think good effort was put into making Attck of the Clones. This is most definitely a movie to watch, as well as all the other Star Wars."
4,Very good for a science fiction movie.,"Normally I don't go for these kind of sci-fi action movies, but Attack of the Clones was surprisingly good. It had great special effects and very original characters in it, like the Genosians, whose language is the most creative thing I have ever seen in a Star Wars movie. It had some cliche moments in it, like the heros being forced to fight monsters in this big pit in front of all the inhabitants of an alien planet as a death sentence, the forbidden love thing, Jedi apprentices revolting against their masters, etc. etc. But it had a surprising amount of plot for a movie with so many gun/lightsaber fights. And seeing Yoda kick butt in a lightsaber duel with Count Dooku! WOW. EASILY one of the best moments in ANY of the Star Wars movies!!! I wasn't incredibly impressed with the acting, though. Yoda, Watto, Mace Windu and Obi Wan were the best characters."
2,A terrible shame,"I think Lucas was just too big a man in Hollywood. Rather than a collaboration of talent as in the original trilogy, you get Lucas doing what he alone wanted, with nothing but yes-men and admirers to get advice from. A terrible shame. Probably the best of the prequels."
1,shockingly bad,"I'm not a Star Wars fan but I've seen the rest of the series, and I expected Clones to be enjoyable. I got halfway through. I was appalled. If George Lucas is no longer interested, he should hand the project to someone else. The script is shockingly bad, high-school-project bad, and Lucas' direction is inexplicably amateurish. So unless you're an addict, be warned: stay away."
2,Dissapointment,"I have to say this film was a total dissapointment. Yes it had specail effects, but it was boring and it seemed to have lost the plot. I am a Star Wars fan, and i was looking forward to seeing this, and i saw it twice at the cinema and i still fell short changed. I will not be buying this one and i hope that the next one will be much better."
1,"Horrible from beginning to end (Well, except for 5 minutes)","This movie was flat, lifeless and pointless. The romance was predictable, the characters were boring and the action was just a rehash of all the other action movies since CGI really came on line.The movie has two redeeming qualities-a five minute action sequence with Yoda and the lovely, comely Natalie Portman.Not exactly worth 9 bucks and 2 1/2 hours of my life."
1,Walk on by,Don't buy this poor effort by George Lucas. Everyone I know was disapointed by this extremely overrated film. Don't waste your money.
1,Just another question,"Sorry, is there a way to rate this 0 stars? I would be VERY interested to know how prior to enetring my full review."
2,Little Plot or Conviction,"""Star Wars - Episode II, Attack of the Clones"" if nothing more makes ""Episode I"" look much better. This film falls flat on its face. It really needs some life brought to the screen. The unfortunate thing is that not one actor in this film or any part of its script can give it life. Very unfortunate. Disc 2 really lacks anything of substance and is very repetative."
1,Georgy better get his act together for episode three,"absolute crap. there are no words bad enough to describe this movie. First of all, once again lucas chose a horrid actor for anakin. Natalie Portman cannot act to save her life. These critiques are coming from someone who enjoyed episode I except for the actor who played anakin, and jar jar binks. Now, the battle scene and the arena fight were good. But the lightsaber duel was bad. Now i did enjoy yoda's lightsaber duel, but, people in the theater were laughing. Youre not supposed to laugh at a Star Wars movie, plain and simple."
4,Buffalo Tiger and the River of Grass,"This is a book that honestly tells the story of the lives of the Miccosukee Indians who live with the disasters wreaked upon their homeland by the encroachment of the White Man's ""civilization."" Buffalo Tiger is a full blooded native of the Everglades, born on an island in the real glades. He operates a tour business taking visitors into the glades to see the real environment. It tells of the environmental problems that have driven many of the natives to abandon their homes and move even as far as Miami. It also describes beautifully, the glories of this unique environment and the attempts of the adults in the tribe to keep their culture alive as their children are lured into the TV culture. It is a great book for both environmental education and for teaching about cultural diversity. Beautifully illustrated with color photographs taken by the author."
3,A MIddle-of-the-Road Racer,"This is a game I picked up cheap to pass the time until better offerings hit the shelves. There's nothing terribly wrong with it, the game just isn't all that compelling. I liked the sci-fi elements ( Wipeout-style weapons ) and some of the car designs were unique and somewhat cool. I also liked the fact that these futuristic cars were cars with actual wheels and not the ( overdone ) hovercraft type. Another fun feature is that when these Lego-constructed vehicles are zapped by certain weapons they will shed pieces on the track until, at the end of some races, you will finish with little more than the frame intact.Now for the downside: There really isn't much challenge here and the tracks don't vary much in style or difficulty. Still, this isn't a bad choice for the younger set as it is colorful, easy to get the hang of, and is almost entirely inoffensive. Just be sure not to pay much more than $20 for it."
2,Sucks!,"This game SUCKS! The graphics are okay, but the rest is garbage! If you think this game is actually fun, you haven't played a REAL racing game. It is such a waste of hard-earned money."
4,Good DIctionary,"I purcased this particular dictionary because it includes ancient script notations for the words. It is orginized by Pinyin romanization, however there is an index in the back that includes the standard radical/stroke count referance. Since I am not a native speaker, I rely on the index to find most words. Each listing includes the stroke order, ancient forms, pinyin, related word combinations, as well as definations. It seems to have an extensive vocabulary. I have yet to encounter a word that was not included."
5,Great upgrade.,Title says it all. atv was almost 10 yrs old . I work it hard last year I decide to give some tlc. So I cleaned up the racks and threw in these springs. I plow so these help out. They add a little payload and make the atv sit a little higher. which is nice as i have oversized tires. I don't really no how they are on the trail as I rarely use my atv for that.
3,wait for it to come on cable,I had never heard of this movie before but saw it was a comedy and starred the guy from the face book movie and Tracy Morgan from 30 Rock so I gave it a try. The movie follows the lead through a couple of strange days with his mother and a couple of other characters. Without spoiling I thought that there was several unnecessary scenes in the movie that really had no place in a comedy and a terrible conclusion. While some parts of the movie were somewhat funny it seemed like there was a lot of filler material that lost both mine and my husband's interest. Overall it was not a bad film it just seemed like they could have taken advantage of a good cast with more humor or provocative drama. Would watch for free but not pay for.
5,Great Movie,Definite must see! Jesse was great. Who knew he could really play the piano. Melissa Leo and Tracy Morgan are powerful on screen. Touching and Funny.
4,"Cool movie, funny.","Dark subject matter, def should be rated R. But funny. Love the part about reenactors. Jesse Esenburg does a good job being in character."
1,Acting WAS great!! Movie still sucked!,Poorly written. Would not recommend this movie. Even the spectacular actors and talent involved couldn't save this terrible plot and poorly written hogwash.
3,It was okay,It was a little Long and drawn out. Slow moving at times but did have funny parts to it. Didn't keep my attention at times.
5,Check It Out,"This movie was very good. Great pacing and fantastic performances from Jesse Eisenberg and Melissa Leo. They are both at the top of their game here. The story was also gripping and heartfelt, and the dialogue genuine. Fantastic score as well. Check it out."
5,It's about to get wild and wooly!,"A highly entertaining rollicking escapade. Full of funny moments, the film's strong cast (Tracy Morgan, Jessie Eisenberg, and Melissa Leo) really makes this a wild ride!"
3,Could have been great...,"With such a great cast, the only flaw to this would have to be the writing. If not that then the director did not know what he was doing. The simple plot should have had joke after joke, but somewhere along the way it decided to be another type of movie. It started out as a black comedy, then went into a more goofy-ball comedy, then moved into a serious coming of age piece without ever defining a pleasing character structure. The acting was good, Tracy Morgan was calmer than usual, but for all it could have been it just did not pull itself off well."
5,Many things to love!,"There were many things to appreciate in Why Stop Now. First, what fabulous casting! Jesse Eisenberg, Melissa Leo, and Tracy Morgan were very well matched. Tracy keeps it funny with his jokes, Jesse has his usual quirkiness to his character and Melissa is completely outrageous. Isiah Whitlock Jr. is a perfect companion for Tracy Morgan. They work so well together and are hilarious! While the story line is very serious, they make it comical while keeping it light. I do believe these issues should be taken very seriously, but Jesse handles it with grace and perseverance. There are so many funny and outrageous scenes that occur. My favorite being the drug purchase. Finally, I love the musical element of the story! Definitely a must see!!"
5,harley purse,Absolutely love it!!!! Not too big and not too small just the right size!! Colors are nice and bright.. Have had a few compliments and people wanting to know where I got it
4,Almost Perfect,"I got the AV-2100 for Xmas.....It is a fully functional remote control that has a tremendous amount of key codes available and can pretty much learn from any remote control. I have it setup to control My Panasonic HDTV, GI Cable Box, Yamaha Receiver, Mitsubishi VCR , Sony DVD and Sony 100 Disc Changer. Real easy to program once you get the hang of it and the Macro keys work like a champ. I have key one setup to turn on my cable box, TV and AMP, Key 2 turns on the DVD player, changes the input on the TV to component 1 and switches my AMP to DVD input. Key 3 turns everything off.Here are my complaints:Remote could be a little narrower if you are holding the remote in one hand you cant really reach all the keys without putting it down. I would like customizable keys so you can name each touch key whatever you want.Over all a must have if you own a home theater system and a bucket full of remotes.....Dominick"
5,Handles most things wonderfully,"I have been using this remote control for about four years now. Back then, I paid about $120 for it. This has been one of my favorite stereo purchases. My wife found it confusing while we had six Sony remotes (2 VCRs, DVD player, amp, tape deck, cd player) that, to her, all looked similar. I bought the remote and it immediately worked flawlessly with all of the components. When I started replacing various equipment, all I had to do was reprogram the remote for the different components. For example, I now have a JVC TV. I entered the three digit code and it works perfectly. I also have a Cyberhome DVD player. I had to manually program all of the buttons. It took all of 5 minutes (including reading the instructions) and I now have full functionality of my DVD. No complaints. When this one dies (if it dies), I will not hesitate to replace it with another Sony universal remote."
1,Only lasted 10 months,This is my second Sony remote of this type. This one lasted only 10 months before the volume and channel keys stopped working.Sony. Never Again!
2,"Sound deteriorates, quits working","Had these for two seasons. The sound, not really that great to begin with, has deteriorated on both speakers and on one, only treble now coming out. Replacing with Polk Atrium 4s."
5,best outdoor option available period,"I bought this item as a way to bring music outside. I researched to find out what would be the best overall sound as well as durable item to buy. I have a set of outdoor speakers at my house that look like rocks. Never been that impressed.This speaker is amazing. The sound it puts out is huge and so is the item in overall size. It is big enough that we put an extra long cable on it and now we comfortably bring it off the deck whenever we want.I have no complaints about this speaker and for he price compared to other options, you really can't go wrong."
1,Re-mastered Rubbish,"If you like the original recordings of the music on these 2 CD's, then please don't buy this double album. The music has been digitally re-mastered, and it sounds awful - in fact nothing like the original. What a waste of money, I only hope that I can get my money back."
5,good product,It does the job! They only thing that would have been better is if it tilted up and down. Good bargain tho
1,Try something else,"I finished the book because I kept hoping that it would get interesting, but it never really did. The writing is second-rate and the story doesn't go anywhere. Don't waste your time on it."
2,Dialogue wasn't good.,"Dialogue was halting, stiff, and unrealistic. This caused the main character to appear lifeless and overly polite. She was so polite and cried all the time you couldn't bond with her. Good plot but overall not worth your time or money."
2,We all talk...,"Why is decent, normal sounding dialogue so hard to recreate? I'm not even done with the book but after all the typos and bad dialogue, I can't wait to get to the library and find something else. ""you'll loose all your money,"" for example, and ""you'll like her. She's smart and pretty."" yes, when discussing my friends with other friends that haven't met, I always tell them how attractive the other is upfront. Not intriguing, or very good but it's free so try it for yourself!"
4,It Takes A Township,"What a delight it was to be reminded of everyday life in the 50's and 60's in a farming community. Maybe it DOESN'T require a ""village"" to raise a child....a township seems to have done the job just fine in the case of the Porter children. The contributions of extended family, neighbors, churches, teachers, doctors and friends were shown to be the treasures that they truly are in this down-to-earth memoir. I wish the children of today could experience the life of hard work, self esteem, generosity, faith, respect and love that I read about on these pages."
3,Animation great! Theme very very dark,I love animation and I love dark themes but with this movie you really had to try not to take it seriously or you could very easily be appalled. So its definitely not for the squeamish or anyone who is offended easily. The animation was great but yes it is very very dark and morbid subject matter.
4,I NEED A PHSYCIATRIST .......,I GOT HALF WAY THROUGH THIS AND HAD TO STOP. I'M WILL FINISH WATCHING IT WHEN I GET MY NERVE BACK.
1,I want my time and money back!,I usually love animated movies but this takes the cake as the worst i have ever seen. The animation is horrible as well as the story is horrible. I would have more fun throwing 11 dollars out the window. Don't waste your time!
4,A good book,"Strange me! I'm a grown-up who still likes to read The Babysitters Club! We first met Danielle in the book Jessi's Wish. In that book, Danielle had been diagnosed with leukemia. Danielle was taking chemotherapy at the time. Jessi and the Troublemaker concerns the fact that Danielle, recovering from leukemia, is 'getting away with' a little too much. Her parent's are so happy to see Danielle getting better that they are being very lenient and taking the stance of 'let kids be kids. Jessi has been babysitting for Danielle and her brother Greg. Jessi feels concerned about some of the things Danielle is doing. Toward the end of the book, a dangerous incident helps Danielle's parents see that Jessi may be right to have been so concerned. If you enjoy the Babysitters Club, you will likely enjoy this book."
3,"Nice idea, but it could benefit from a wider perspective","A nice idea for a novel, but I think the execution could have been better. The Jewish POV seemed narrow, and would have benifitted from the addition of Jewish characters of maybe Jordanian (who would have a similar experience to the Arab characters in this novel), or other Arab origin. It is strange that Jews of Middle Eastern and African origin don't have a larger part in this story when they make up around 50% of Israels Jewish population."
1,"Not worth reading,not worth the$ollars it costs.","The best thing about this book is its dustcover,Compliments to the Artist.The text in it? Its a lot of madeup chatter with history written from researched material.The author tried hard to produce something worthwile but failed miserably.I classify ESTERS CHILD not worth the $ollars it costs and the time it takes to read it.I am very dissappointed"
5,WONDERFUL !!,"""ESTER'S CHILD"" IS A STUNNING PAGE-TURNER WHICH I COULD NOT PUT DOWN. FROM THE INTRIGUING PROLOGUE TO THE RIVETING CONCLUSION IT'S PACKED WITH ADVENTURE, HEARTBREAK, TERROR, LOVE AND FILLED WITH SUSPENSE AND MANY THOUGHT-PROVOKING ISSUES. IT'S A COMPLEX AND EMOTIONAL ROLLER-COASTER WHICH TAKES PLACE IN WAR-TORN EUROPE AND THE MID-EAST FROM THE PERIOD 1938-1983. AGAINST THIS HISTORICAL BACKGROUND THE NOVEL IS ABOUT 3 FAMILIES FROM VERY DIFFERENT CULTURES - JEWISH, ARAB AND GERMAN. THEIR COMPLEX AND INSPIRING STORIES AND HOW THEIR LIVES EVENTUALLY INTERTWINE MAKE FOR A WONDERFUL AND MESMERIZING READ. MS. SASSON HAS CREATED A FANTASTIC BOOK, TRANSPORTING HER READERS INTO 'ESTER'S WORLD'. RUN..DON'T WALK..TO GET YOUR COPY!"
5,Two Sides of the Coin,"This is a riveting historic novel that presents protraits of two families of Jewish and Arab descent. The third family is the family of a former S.S. officer during WWII. These three families become intertwined in situations that are at times harrowing, at other times touching. The emotions, thoughts, and actions of each member interplay with the circumstances of the time and come to a most unsuspecting ending.I enjoyed this novel and found myself looking forward to the next chapter and was hoping the book would not end."
5,Another page-turner from Jean Sasson,"A stunning and moving novel that I highly recommend to all. I am a great fan of Ms. Sasson's books, including Princess, Princess Sultana's Daughters, and Sultana's Circle, all books of non-fiction, and was not sure how the author would compare when writing fiction. I was so affected by this book and it's shocking ending. It is a book that all should read, particularly at this difficult time."
4,Cars,This game is very cool. I have been playing this game for a very long time. The Pics are very cool. I think if you like raceing this game is for you.
5,my review,this game besides sprint car is a game teaching kids how to get to the big show by racing mini series.it is a awesome game.
2,What a waste of potenial..,"First off, I appluad infro games for making & great career mode. I love the different options & stats. It keeps you in the game. You really want to get that top spot. Your name in the paper is nice too..The downfall is the gameplay. It severly lacks. The cars have no sense of speed which translates into a boring game. Going 70-80 isnt fast for a race game. How can a group so focuced on realism not add more speed is beyond me. The sounds [stink] & the crowds cheering sounds muffled. The worst part besides the lack of speed are the graphics. They look like a PS1 game. That wouldn't be so bad if the game play was tight. I agree with another reviwer about the analog controls being slow & sluggish. Buy this game used if at all. It's not worth the [money] by a long shot.."
4,Great release by full cycle,"I am very glad to hear this type of experimentation with other flavors. I love the flamenco guitars, it gives it a latin tip to it. I have always liked the inovative tracks from full cycle. If you like this type of dnb with a soulful tip check out V Recording's Brasil EP (sorry nerds, its only on vinyl). KEEP IT ROLLIN'."
1,"I got the wrong tape, too","TDK's use of the word ""Premium"" is misleading marketing.I was aiming for a special, collection-quality tape in a 160 size, and was taken by the name ""Premium.""Don't do as I did. Instead -- before you purchase -- check TDK's website to see that their ""Premium"" tape is a standard-quality tape.As of 1/2/09, I still don't see Amazon offering any TDK ""Super Pro"" or ""EHG"" tapes any longer than 120 mins.Of course, 15 years after my original review, I might recommend joining the 21st Century, getting rid of the VCR, and switching to a DVD recorder with integrated Digital-TV (DTV) tuner for Free, over-the-air, static-free programming and recordings. Get one that can use DVD-RAM for enhanced record/playback functions. You might be convinced to give up the Cable TV, eliminating one of your monthly bills."
3,Guys...TDK Revue tapes ARE the standard grade ones,"Those who are said they got the wrong tapes need to do a little more research. JR didn't send you the wrong tapes...Revue tapes are standard grade tapes.What is misleading is that TDK markets them with the term ""premium quality"", but they are still standard grade tapes.The tapes (in order of increasing quality) are:Revue - ""Standard Grade""HS - ""High Standard"" gradeVivid - ""High Grade""EHG - ""Extra High Grade""...and they go up from there.I'm not supposed to post a url, so do a google search for TDK's website using the following search criteria ""tdk recmedia vhs"" and you will get detailed information regarding these tapes."
4,An 80's game done right for 2003.,"I needed a break from Hitman 2 and Splinter Cell (already played Halo), so I picked up Defender for some mindless shooting. It is actually not so mindless, and is kind of addictive. I almost forgot how much fun it is to fly, and in Defender you have some good choices and you can upgrade your weapons depending on how well you complete each mission.I am about 1/3 of the way through the missions, they get progressively tougher. When you fail a mission you can start it over. Some of objectives in the missions seem impossible at first, but when you have the right ship, the right weapons and the right strategy ""its like butter, baby""!"
1,Doesn't work on an xbox360,"Waste of time and money. I hought it had the original arcade game. Not only did it not have the original game, but it would not even boot in the xbox360 console."
4,SRC'S SECOND LP,"MILESTONES IS SRC'S SECOND LP,ALMOST AS GOOD AS THEIR FIRST.SO IF YOU LIKE THEIR FIRST,YOU'LL LIKE THIS ONE TOO.I'M NOT SURE,BUT I THINK THAT THEIR COVER ON GRIEG'S ""IN THE HALL OF THE MOUNTAIN KING/BOLERO"" WAS INSPIRED BY JEFF BECK'S GROUP COVER A YEAR AGO(1968).BEST TRACKS:NO SECRET DESTINATION,CHECKMATE,UP ALL NIGHT[THERE IS A LATE SIXTIES-EARLY SEVENTIES HARD PSYCHE COMPILATION CD WITH THE SAME TITLE AND SRC'S SONG,THAT GAVE IT'S TITLE TO THE WHOLE COMPILATION,IN ONE OF THE BEST TRACKS THERE],TURN INTO LOVE,SHOW ME.GARY QUACKENBUSH'S GUITAR GOES SOMETIMES HARDER HERE THAN IN THEIR FIRST.CD'S SOUND QUALITY IS VERY GOOD TOO."
3,Up All Night Is Great.....,"...Alas, the rest is not. It isn't bad, for teenage-head-drug-fueled philosophical maundering and navel gazing. Just don't hope, as I did, for any other pile-driving tracks."
1,Well it's pretty..,"Yes, it is a very pretty belly ring. I just love the colour and the style, though I agree the bar is too long, but I am unsure of how the previous buyer's changed it. After wearing it for a few hours around the home when it first arrived, I noticed the middle part of the rose had fallen out. I was devastated. Luckily, I found it and was able to glue it bad in place. Other than that, it lokos extremely good, especially for summer!Just like to add despite the fact that I glued it back in place, the centre part of the rose continues to fall off."
5,Best Poor Old Lu ever...maybe the best of the year.,"I really like this album from beginning to end. Every song is great, they worked hard on this and you can tell. The only albums of 2002 that I think might be better are Rush's Vapor Trails & Sixpence None the Richer's Divine Discontent. Some of the songs remind me a bit of Sunny Day Real Estate, some sound like old Poor Old Lu. The rest sound very fresh and alive. These guys have made a masterpiece. Just listen to the sound files, and even a short piece indicates that this is a strong album."
3,Old Meets New!?,When I was younger and sat in church every Sunday I truly enjoyed the peace and calm Gregorian Chants offered me. Fast forward several dozen years and I discovered that same kind of peace and contentment in New Age Music. Paul Avgerinos merges these two formats in Phos Hilaron to create a nicely blended sound that is heavy on the New Age side. It is like a Bloody Mary that takes ones's beloved vodka and mixes it with just the right amount of tasty tomato juice to create a whole new sensation. Phos Hilaron may not be the best of both worlds but it is a pretty satisfying musical Bloody Mary anyhow.
5,Reference Material,Just a quick note about this book. I needed a good but easy reference on WWII aircraft. I have used Dover books in the past. They remain the best in this price range available.
4,nice product,"muy util, a must have for field work. lo único malo que veo es que los cables de alimentación son muy cortos, recomiendo conseguir una conexión quizás de 5 pies o mas."
4,Buen producto pero le falta potencia.,"me parece muy buen producto pero tengo un problema...funciona muy bien para aparatos eléctricos de mayor capacidad como un congelador de 10 pies, sin embargo, no hace prender una lámpara de 60 watts. Necesito revisar las conecciones ya que desconozco cuanto es el consumo en el arranque de las lamparas. En general funciona muy bien y ni siquiera necesita prender el ventilador interno para enfriarlo. Buscare la solución o tal vez tenga que comprar uno de mayor capacidad."
2,broken promise,"comes with built in watt meter and dc voltmeter that have no accuracy (worthless) just to make sale. i called power bright about problem and tech reprehensive said they were all made like that. if i knew about this i would not have bought, lost all faith in unit. what is the sense of putting a four digit(digital) meter on the unit with no accuracy. great engineering. i have a 35 watt load on and it shows 0000 watts, i have a 100 watt load and it shows 40 watts. the last digit alway shows a 0 in volt or watt mode. LOL"
1,Permanent Failure after overload warning.,"Does NOT reset after 'overload' condition. Powered 1000 watt (digital readout) convection oven for 10mins. Unit went into 'overload' condition (I suspect temperature overload) even though fan running with full airflow availability. I shut down unit and after cooling, turned on the pwr-switch. Unit registered red-led + chirp (overload) and would not deliver output power. Disconnected from battery source overnight. Reconnected and tried again. Same failure. There is NO seperate 'overload' reset swtich. It appears that the internal 'firmware' is 'stuck' in ""overload-protectioin"" mode. Now it's a pretty blue paper-weight. (first use)."
1,Broke after 3 hours of use,"Here I am in post-Sandy Long Island. No power, but I had planned for this after Irene. I hooked up the inverter to my car battery and ran some lights (about 120W worth) for 3 hours on the first night I lost power. On the second night the unit was dead. The alarm was constantly on, there was no digital readout, no nothing. It didn't run even with no load. The fuses were fine (n.b. use some vise grips to get those nasty suckers out) and Power Bright support told me I need to send the unit in. Not actually very convenient, considering I really needed it during the blackout, not a week or two later. Well, the little 175W Peak inverter I got as stocking stuffer last Christmas is still running four days later, so I'm sticking with that and returning this paperweight to That Store With Really Liberal Return Policies. No more Power Bright for me, thanks very much."
3,Duck,Now I can rate the inverter. I bought this for my 18 wheeler truck. If that is what you are buying it for you will have to buy power cable to run from the batteries to into the cab of the truck and hook to the inverter. All you get with the kit is two wires about 2' long with clamps on one end and connector for the inverter on the other. I have connected it to the truck's batteries now. I plugged in a 700w microwave and it shuts off the inverter. I set the microwave to low power and it shuts off. Instructions said it would handle it. Apparently not. I am considering sending it back since it will not do what I need it to do.
3,Surge is not as rated...,"This unit is advertised to go to 2200 watts. it cuts off way before that amount, if you are looking to run some motors that may be at the upper end of 1400 watts starting load you may want to consider the next largest unit. I may have to send this back, and I really hate sending things back. Unit works fine for lighter loads and seems well made however."
2,Could be a lot better,"I would not buy another one of these. I liked the idea of a watts and voltage display, but the watts only displayed 4 zeros always. The voltage meter was inaccurate by several hundred mv. Also, the posts on the back are too close together which means you can't use conventional clamps but must use the screw post fittings to clamps that come with the set (or make your own). Also, I have discovered that one (of 3) fuses can run 1/4 the cost of the whole unit. Yikes! Be careful!Delivery was speedy, price was good, but you only get what you pay for. A nice looking compact unit but not quite ready for prime time."
3,The fan is noisy!,It works ok but the fan is noisy! I kept it but I'm not happy about it. I use it for a TV on a boat.
5,Power Bright Inverter,"I bought this to run a small chest freezer (1.3 Amp draw) 3.0 Cu.Ft.It works great, handles the start up surge with no problems. It seems to be well made. I have not tested it with other items."
1,not for me,"I can say its only good for charging cell phones or other light devices, not good for work or household appliances"
2,"the poor design left out the reset button, 1 0verload lockout, you're","the poor design left out the reset button, 1 0verload lockout, you're screwed out of 70.00. I still need one, as a courtesy claim of warrantee defect. Otherwise, goodbye amazon and power bright"
4,good product,"The shipping was incredibly fast, ordered on a thursday and got it on monday during a hurricane and it was free. Only used the product as a test run for a tailgate but works as advertised. Will update after the tailgate."
5,Used in storm shelter,"We use this inverter in a storm shelter here in West Texas. It is connected to a automotive battery. Have a Battery Tender on the battery to keep it charged. In a tornado the inverter will provide power to the shelter for TV, radio, lights and a fan. Tests of the system have been perfect. The inverter has good connections for plugging it in and for clamping it to the battery. Like the front display showing stats."
3,Two Optimus Prime's I Better Use My Vr-Visor!,This Video Is Ok. I loved watching the transformers with Jack Angel as the real Optimus Prime. Gotta go and save the world with Optimus Prime!Driver Amy
4,Great Speakers,put them in ceiling and with the aimable tweeter they sound like they right behind you they are perfect for movie also go for music but they sound way better sticking to movie dont get me wrong they sound great with music but you can tell they need a little more umph to them ..nice clean profes look oh i uses they as rears worth gettin cause they are hidden ot of the way
5,Surprisingly good,Never expected these to sound so great. I made sure to fill the ceiling cavity with insulation before installing these and it made a huge difference in how tight the sound is. DON'T FORGET TO DO THIS.
1,Sound quality adequate at best,"I bought the Polk RC 80i speakers for a multi-room sound system in my home. If you like classical music, where crispness and full range fidelity are important, this is not your speaker. Highs are muddy, and lows are virtually non-existent. Mid-range is adequate. I have owned Polk Audio floor speakers, and these are in no way comparable. I did a side-by-side test with some M&K S125 home theater speakers, and the Polks sounded washed out and flat by comparison. For low volume, background music these speakers are okay, but audiophiles--or those who know what a good quality speaker should sound like--will not be pleased."
3,"Good for the price for home theatre, but don't expect great music","I ordered these speakers based on the low price (120/pair) and polk's name for a new home theatre system. After different testing I find that while they do work well for the price and sound good, they do not have a good frequency response for regular music. They sound muddy at higher volumes and have a definite accentuation of the vocal ranges while neglecting the low, low-mid and high ranges. With a good eq this might be addressed but id rather opt for a better quality speaker and try the Boston Acoustics hsi 470s instead. I'd recommend this only to someone who does not plan on playing alot of music, just movies, or who wants them as a small room background music speaker."
5,Lowest price on the web,Needed 1 more speaker for the backyard patio. Bought this pair. Does what it is suppose to do! Would like them to consider packaging 1 per instead of two!
2,poor sound quality,"was not happy at all with this product. Installed them in a bathroom. Sounded like listening to an alarm clock radio.I bought some emotiva uac 8.2 at the same time just to compare. The emotiva's are far superior in every way, build quality, low end, mids and highs. I will use the emotivas in the bathroom and probably give away the polk audio junk. Tested with sonos zp90 source, and rotel amp."
5,Sweet,"I have used almost all speakers there are and I was so happy to see they make these for the house as well. Great sound, great price and I love the white. Easy to install as well."
5,Work Perfectly in the Kitchen,I bought these for my wife to use in the kitchen and installed them in the cabinets. They work great for ambient background music. I liked that they're flat all the way across and blend in unlike the Pyle PDIC80 I was considering. At 9in from edge to edge they were overall a little bit bigger than I was expecting. I paired them with the AudioSource AMP-100 2-Channel Amplifier. I don't know if it's the amp or the speakers but while they're loud enough for the kitchen I do have to have them turned up almost full blast. I don't know what the RMS is but peak is rated at 40 watt and the amp is rated at 50 watt RMS per channel.[Edit] I did some more listening today and the quietness was due to the source. They're plenty loud now and they sound fantastic.
5,GREAT SPEAKERS,"BOUGHT 3 PAIR OF THESE SPEAKERS FOR MY NEW HOME, INSTALLED TWO PAIR IN MY LIVING ROOM THEY ARE POWERED BY A PIONEER ELITE VSX-60 VERY CLEAR SOUND THE OTHER PAIR WAS INSTALLED ON MY BACK PATIO JUST AS CLEAR, VERY EASY INSTALLATION, GRILLS COME MOUNTED ON SPEAKERS BUT COME OFF EASY IF YOU JUST TWIST THE EDGE OF THE SPEAKER DOWN THEY COME UP AND YOU CAN GRAB THE COVER, NO REASON TO USE A PAPER CLIP, AS THIS MAY DAMAGE THE COVER."
3,Just remember what you're buying,"I purchased 4 of the RC80i for surround sound in my living room, lefts and rights for both front and back speakers. My rationale in purchasing in-ceiling speakers was the desire not to have a room filled with visible speakers. The mounting was very easy. Just cut the holes via the template and slide them in. The grilles fit snug and I'm sure will be a challenge if I ever have to remove them. The directional tweeter design is great and a must with in-ceiling speakers. Unfortunately, I was hoping for a little better fidelity. The speakers lack the high frequencies. They're good when listening to movies but you can hear the difference when listening to music. I set my expectations too high and have to remind myself of the price."
4,Great buy!,I shopped around for similar speakers at local shops and places like Best Buy and Circuit City. All others were way over priced. The Polks were a great buy. I use them as the rear speakers in a surround sound. They sound great. The speakers come with a cutout template and a template to mask the speakers if you want to paint them. They were very easy to install. A very nicely designed speaker. I'm very glad I purchased them from Amazon.
4,great sound,sound great in large room. Installed four in 18x20 room. very difficult to get grill off without damaging it. only gave it four stars due to grill difficulty. polk needs to think about packaging without grill attached.
5,Awesome speakers for the money,"I debated back and forth and finally went with these when they dropped below $90/pair...great decision. They installed easily, look great on the ceiling, and produce quality sound. I am using these with a Russound system and they really met my expectations. Very satisfied."
5,Crisp clean sound,"These speakers are the perfect addition to and whole home audio system, Very easy to install. If installing into the ceiling and you can access the back side, I would recommend building a box around the speaker to enclose them with some insulation for acoustics. You will receive a deeper sound and you won't loose it into the attic."
3,ok.,"I'm using 4 of these as surrounds. Don't get me wrong, when you get a good 5.1 movie soundtrack it's an awesome experience, but I'm just not convinced you need to spend a lot of money on surrounds (that is, if it's mainly for HT), and at this point if I had to do it again, would probably only go with 2 instead of 4. That being said, music sounds great and the install was a snap. I think the template they give you for the cutout is a smidge small, and probably on purpose. Be prepared to ""recut"" the hole a lil bigger, but other than that, real easy. So yes, I would recommend these."
5,Great speakers!,"Great speakers, no complaints. A definite step up in quality of sound from the 6.5 inch speakers in the other room."
1,Soud quality is poor,"I bought a pair of these speakers based on the good reviews from other customers. Unfortunately, I do not think it deserves the honor most customers gave to it: the sound quality is poor: the sound quality is poorer than the speakers of a SONY mini book-shelf system with a total price of $160 bought from Bestbuy. I returned the pair of speakers.I later ordered a pair of Pioneer S-IC831-LR ceiling speakers. Although the sound quality is not as good as I have expected, it is basically on par with the speakers of the low-end Sony mini shelf system: the lower frequency part is not as good, but the sound is more clear for the Pioneer speakers. The Pioneer S-IC831-LR is definitely a much better choice, at least to me.I will NOT recommend this speaker to any of my friends."
2,good quality but not enough bass,"Loved the quality and construction of these speakers, but not enough bass when installed in-ceiling. All my old albums sounded tinny, lost the deep bass."
2,Fair to Average Speakers,"I used four of these speakers for part of an in-ceiling, home theater system. Sound is only fair to average. I recommend spending more money to obtain a richer, less tinny, sound."
1,One word - CHEAP.,"Why in the world do any of the reviewers think these sound good? I thought that the brand name would mean quality, but these are complete junk and sound like plastic junk. Polk ought to be ashamed to have their name on this product."
5,Polk RC80i,Great sound and crispness. Used in 7.1 surround environment and they work well for 20' x 14' room.
4,good as mid range speakers,"I was being cheap and got these speakers. They're good for the price, but they only have mid-range responses. So you must have a good Center speaker and a sub woofer to go with these! Otherwise you'll have a hard time hearing what people are saying (the highs) or feeling the thunders (the lows)."
4,Great speakers,"I purchased 4 of these speakers and installed them in my living room. Yes, there are better speakers, but for this price, they are great speakers. Bass and treble are to my satisfaction. Like other reviewers, the speaker's grilles are somewhat difficult to get off, so use caution removing them, as you can dent or scratch the grille if being too forceful."
5,My Media room,"Love the speakers, excellent sound. It completes My Mediaroom. I now have a 7.1 setup and the RC60i was a great choice to make to complete it"
4,Good for the money,"These speakers acutally worked out quite well. I thought for the price and size the sound would be tinny and hollow but they're not bad and have some decent bass to them. They are not for cranking up the tunes but great for back ground music.Also, they have one of the shallowest mounting depths out there which is very important to some people. Well worth the money."
5,Love this...,This sound great and are a fantastic addition to my home surround sytem.. The intructions to install them are easy to read and follow.
4,Sound great for the price - well constructed,We were surprised that in-wall speakers could sound so good. Installation was a breeze and we will probably use more units in other rooms now. It was nice to find a good solution that met with the aesthetics committee approval so easily.
4,"Good sound, easy intal",Good speakers easy install. Would prefer better wired connections. They use the old stype instead of the newer style that comes with some other inwalls.
5,Good Ceiling Speakers,"I have these installed on my basement ceiling as my home theater front and back surround speakers. They are perfect for their purpose. Amazon's price was much better than local retail stores, plus free shipping and no sales tax. Can't beat that!"
5,Wonderful Speakers,"We remodeled our kitchen and have these speakers in the wall opposite the work areas. They are the most wonderful part of the new kitchen. Listening to music with great sound makes kitchen work so much more fun. The electrician said they were easy to install, and the sound is great. They can be played loud enough to be heard in other rooms, and there is good bass and no distortion with all types of music. They sound good played quietly too. For the price you just can't go wrong. They sound as if they cost a lot more."
4,Very good value,"I have always been an infinity speaker man, but these speakers were too hard to pass up. They were easy to install, sound great, and have a lot of bass for their size. The upper frequency is a little off for me ( i like the brightness of a kappa tweeter) but still they are very good. Makes for a great remote location speaker, or for some discrete surround sound. I have them mate to a wall control knob in the kitchen.Pyle Home PVC1 Wall Mount Rotary Volume Control Knob"
3,Meh -- Yamaha NS-IW480CWH is a better speaker,"I installed these in my kitchen ceiling and used them for about three years. They looked good, and were easy to install, but the sound was mediocre. When it was time to install ceiling speakers in the living room, a friend recommended the Yamaha NS-IW480CWH. The Yamahas in the living room sounded so much better than the Polks that I decided to replace the Polks in the kitchen with a second pair of Yamahas. And indeed, the sound is better in the kitchen with the Yamahas -- much clearer and brighter highs. The Yamahas are just slightly more expensive than the Polks.Also, as other reviewers have mentioned, getting the grille off the RC80i is difficult. The method recommended in the instructions -- using a paperclip -- is ridiculous ineffective. I found it difficult to get the grilles off without damaging them."
3,Great for the price; just don't play them too loud,"For the low price of under $100, these are superb for a single purpose. For us, that purpose is soft, quiet background music in a formal dining room that is not used very often. If you intend to play louder or try to fill a room or section of your house, these speakers will not do well. They get muddy at higher volumes and do not have good bass.But, for a small space where you only need background music, these can't be beat for the price. Once your hole is cut, these install easily. Cutting the hole is a project in and of itself. Be careful!"
5,"Easy installation, sounds great, seamless with wall","The package includes a very useful template for installation and painting. I used a spray gun to paint the grill and the speakers are virtually seamless with the wall. Two of these speakers were used as rear channels for our surround sound system. The tweaters were simple to point downward to direct sound towards the seating area. Sound quality is very good. It would be nice if they offered a 4"" version."
3,Great for surround speakers nothing more.,I purchased these to be surround sound speakers for my home theater system. For that purpose I am happy with them. But I wouldn't buy these to do nothing more. I tried listening to radio thru them and wasn't impressed. If you are buying these for stereo sounds for a patio or multi room listening I would suggest you buy the 80's. I have the Polk 85's and think they are excellent. Installation was a easy since I had studs exposed to start. That made wiring easy. Putting the speAker in was simple just cut a hole and use a screwdriver and had it is done in minutes. Price was right. Electronic stores sell one of these for the price amazon got me the pair. Hope this helps.
5,POLK AUDIO SPEAKER,"PURCHASED AS A REPLACEMENT,AS OUR ORIGINAL SPEAKER DIED AFTER FIVE YEARS. THIS IS PART OF OUR SURROUND SYSTEM. AMAZON HAD THE BEST PRICE. SPEAKERS FIT PERFECT. DELIVERY WAS PRONTO. WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS."
3,the conjugation of Tagalog verbs,"The book is the reprint of an old publication typed in Courier characters on a typewriter. One would expect a modernized version in Times Roman characters. The authors ignored the accent system devised for Tagalog about a century ago. Only a minority of verbal forms have their stress(es) indicated by the acute accent. Too many are left without accent(s). One of the reasons why I bought this manual was to know how ma- verbs were stressed. These verbs were typed without accents. I suppose a beginner will be disappointed for all the verbs conjugated in this book because of its very limited use of the acute accent. What is also missing is the government of verbs. For instance tanóng ""ask"" has the reference pattern magtanóng ang A ng B sa C ""A to ask B to C"". The average student cannot guess this."
2,just a bunch of verbs,"I don't know how those 501 verbs books work for all those other languages available right now, but I suppose I expected this book to show different types of verbs in Tagalog AND explain how they are used. There is a paradigm of different verbs inflected by aspects and modes, but with no explanation as to how the verb would be used. I was quite disappointed."
5,An excellent Jazz tribute to an excellent Pop record.,"Jazz Guitarist George Benson, along with some of the best musicians the late sixties Jazz scene had to offer, addresses the Beatles' Abbey Road album with respect in 1969. There are some nice vocals here from Benson along with crack instrumental passages that truly get under your skin. Buy it !!"
5,Wonderful tribute album,"I came to this record not as a George Benson fan but as a fan of Abbey Road. It's a wonderful recording, a rare tribute album that does something different with the songs so that you see them in new ways and appreciate them even more. The musicianship and arrangements are excellent, as are George Benson's vocals. I'm glad I found this 40 years after the fact."
3,George Benson The Other Side of Abbey Road,"I can't believe that ol' GB was already in the studio beginning Oct. 22, 1969, to rehash The Beatles' mind-blowing release, just three WEEKS after it was released in the USA. Who does that?George Benson is amazing when he's at his best and I expected fireworks. I got a couple of sparks. Surprisingly, Oh Darling was my favorite, though a million miles apart style-wise from Paul's blistering version. This rambling jazz session bears little resemblance to the songs that were still being played and replayed at the same time all over the world by the Liverpool Lads.But hey, I'm not that into jazz."
3,"IT DIDN'T ALL ""COME TOGETHER""","1969 RELEASE ON THEN-EMERGING CTI RECORDS, THIS IS ONE OF THE FIRST GEORGE BENSON ALBUMS ON THAT LABEL (OF WHICH THERE WERE QUITE A FEW, I HAD EM' ALL A LONG TIME AGO). COVER VERSIONS OF THE SONGS FROM THE BEATLE'S ALBUM ABBEY ROAD, WHICH HAD BEEN RELEASED MERE MONTHS BEFORE. ANOTHER REVIEWER IS CORRECT IN SAYING THAT IT COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER, BUT IT IS A NICE TRIBUTE ALBEIT A BIT TOO COMMERCIAL FOR A JAZZ ALBUM."
3,"OK, but it could have been much better","Creed Taylor uses his heavy hands to nearly murder a bunch of classic songs. Fortunately, George Benson had enough talent to overcome the stifling production."
1,fluff,well it's George Benson. So one should expect superficial and trite. George delivers in spades. Turn the volume down low and you'll get the full elevator music effect you are looking for.
2,They Didn't Call It 'Baddest' For Nothing,"Yes Buddy Guy has an incredible voice and crazy chops regardless of the album in which he may be featured. However, I find this collection to be trash; it's just his later career stuff. I suggest the complete Vangaurd or Chess studio recordings"
3,Given as a gift . . .,I have no information to pass along since I purchased this for someone else. Buddy Guy is a legend among guitar artists so I expect this CD to be great.
5,Buddy Guy at his best!,The Kennedy Center Award winner shows his talents in this compilation and any lover of the Blues cannot ignore these contributions to an American Art form and talent.
3,Up and down,"The album sums up Buddy Guy for me, some awesome songs followed by others that are non descript. It just comes down to whether you find the soaring highs that Buddy gives is enough to cover the frustrations of the next song."
5,Buddy's the best,"This Buddy Guy download was my first. It went smoothly and quickly. I was pleased to see every song was a good one. Loaded it onto my Android phone for listening in the car, etc. If you don't know Buddy, you don't know Blues!"
4,oh yeah,"I like ""Damn Right, I've Got the Blues"" better, but this is still great. I loved Stevie Ray Vaughn, and since Buddy played at the last concert Stevie ever gave, I looked forward to hearing the instrumental tribute to him. I wasn't disappointed. Anybody who thinks Chicago blues is always loud and driving should listen hard to that one. Like any great music, there's more than one way to be blue. Yeah, Buddy."
3,This game was almost good,"The graphics were horrible, and it takes so long to do a tournament, even though they're are almost 30 tournys, and 40 weeks for each this game takes a very long time to beat i would only reccomend it to people who absolutley LOVE soccer and know what they're doing."
3,BRUCE LEE The lost Interview,The video was a bit blurry but it was ok because it is a replacement for my library. unfortunately for someone whom maybe viewing this video for the first time it may seem like it was recorded in a back room. It would be great if the video could be up dated by colorizing and enhancing the audio. But if you are a BRUCE LEE fan it is a must to have by all means.
4,Insightful!,"While most books about selling focus on the salesperson's behavior, this book focuses instead on the client's behavior and the sales approaches you should use depending upon just how weird or annoying - excuse us, that should be ""challenging"" or maybe ""eccentric"" - the client becomes. Josh Gordon clearly and effectively presents 20 different classic, difficult behaviors, including everything from ""The Client Who Lies to You"" to ""The Client Who Knows It All."" Gordon offers useful strategies for dealing with such personalities and situations, strategies that can help you make your sale and then make a clean getaway. The book is written conversationally and includes no filler or fluff, just plenty of well-organized and helpful ideas. We [...] recommend this book to anyone who has to sell a product, service or idea, because sometimes it is nice to know that you aren't the problem."
5,It works!,"I manage a sales staff and bought a copy of ""Tough Calls"" for each of my sales staff. We have all read it and refer to it often. Now, when a problem cleint comes up we start talking about it as a ""Chapter 7"" or a ""Ch apter 11"". ""Tough Calls"" is great stuff and represents new thinking!"
3,Information Overload,"Josh Gordon has obviously been in the sales game for a long time. I have no doubt that he knows what he's doing because I've seen a lot of the situations he discusses in this book. I can't figure out how he expects anyone to use this book. Who is it for? Beginners will find it overwhelming and difficult to translate his suggestions and examples into on-the-scene actions, and experienced reps. will likely be aware of a lot of the materal in this book. There are some good tips though. You'll have to dig them out. Sometimes Gordon is talking to the consultative salesperson, sometimes relationship salesperson and sometimes the closer. If you've read SPIN Selling, you know that closers don't do well in corporate sales. In the end, this book doesn't seem to target anybody. While there's lots of good material, you may find that much of it is not of value to you."
4,Great Movie,"Ice Age is a very entertaining, amusing movie that touches on themes of humanity and compassion. Highly recommended. First movie I've watched using [...] unbox. The service was great and the price unbeatable (1 dollar rental!!!)! The movie downloaded in only a few minutes using a cable internet connection. The quality of the movie was superb--I watched it on a 22 inch LCD Samsung monitor. I will watch many more movies this way."
4,"Good, but the dodo birds are annoying","This movie is charming, cute, fun, enjoyable well written and definitely worth checking out. The only thing that sucks in this movie are the dodo birds, they are annoying as hell. By the way, the animated shorts are great as well. 9/10"
4,Animated Prehistoric Animal Buddy Tale,"Ice Age is a family film that is computer animated. It is full of delightful characters and clever jokes.Set 20,000 years ago at the time of the last Ice Age, a wooly mamoth (Ray Romano) meets Sid (John Leguizamo), a sloth, and they become an odd traveling pair. They find a helpless, cute human infant and decide to return the baby to its human herd. A saber-tooth tiger who is stealthy and cunning joins them because they are searching for a human herd, which means food to eat. Eventually the motley crew bond as they travel through the cold rough territory, facing challenges successfully together. Then there is always the charming side-plot of a fanged squirrel trying to keep an acorn under control. The movie is entertaining, warm-hearted and not too long. Ice Age reminded me a bit of ""Monsters Inc"", however, it keeps an original feel, has funny jokes and exciting adventure that the whole family can enjoy."
3,Solid Movie But Not Spectacular,"Ok, so I'm one of those people that finds Ray Romano's voice gratingly irritating which is why I gave it only three stars. But John Leguizano surprised me in this movie. It took me a while to recognize his voice as that of the sloth. I didn't figure it out until he used his famous ""I'll let you marinate in there for a while.""This movie was cute but not spectacular. It covers the odyssey of a sabre tooth tiger, a wooly mammoth and a sloth on a mission to return a baby human back to its human tribe. They have some laughs and some bonding experiences along the way. It's not in the league of a Shrek or a Lion King, but your kids will enjoy it."
4,Very enjoyable animated film,"A very enjoyable animated feature, whose plot is loosely based on 1948's classic western from John Ford Three Godfathers. Set during (of course) the last Ice Age, the story has a mammoth called Manny, an annoying sloth named Sid and a duplicitous saber tiger called Diego finding a dying human mother along with her baby. They decide to return the infant to their tribe, against all odds, and facing a series of predators (especially saber tigers, who count on Diego on helping them on the inside). Punctuating the plot, a squirrel tries to save an acorn in a series of very funny vignettes. And a running joke is that the only species that do not talk during the movie are human beings. Unfortunately, the graphics are a bit below standard (they are no match for Pixar's works). The sequel has better graphics but a far less interesting plot (though it has a very funny final scene)."
5,You must see this video...was great.,The best family tape I have seen in years. It is hilarious and gives some great moral values in the storyline. I watched this 3 times and I am 49 yrs. old....and my 4 yr. old Grandson is still watching it everyday. Superb.
3,A little too cold...,"I was a little disappointed with this movie. The trailer looked so promising and I think Ray Romano is very funny.His character in this movie, however, is a grouchy, aching whooly mammoth that has lost his entire family. There are too few funny moments in this film and it does have quite a serious tone.This is not necessarily bad and I think children can learn some important lessons here, but if you're looking for a light-hearted movie, this is not it."
3,Cute! A feel-good movie that...,"...has chuckles and giggles @ every turn. John Leguizamo and Denis Leary's lines are priceless...and Ray Romano & Goran Visjnic put forth fabulous voice-overs that speak volumes. Worth a copy in your VHS/DVD collection, and a well-received gift idea for pre-teens and little kids. Movie night? Break out the popcorn, candy and soda and snuggle down with your friends, family & floor pillows. This flick is what we need for mindless entertainment. :)"
3,Makes me cry . . .,"out of boredom. However, my grandmother LOVES this movie; she bought it for everyone, and watches it all the time at our house (which is one of the reasons why i dislike it so much). She esp. loved the part when the baby points at the other guy. Ok, that was funny, but some of the things are redundant. The only thing i really liked about it was the tiger-guy. I thought he was cool. However, I do think its one of the better kid cartoons in the sense that it's something you can expect kids to like; it's also entirely decent (i'm always shocked by the more adult content in a cartoon). If I were thirteen years younger, I'd probably have given it a high five. As it is though, I recommend watching it only once- and give it a three."
4,A hoot and a holler.,"Ya like animation? Ya like ta laugh? Hard?Are ya a kid, or at least can act like one, once in a while?What are you waiting for? This is ""Looney Tunes"" for the 21st century! If the wisecracks don't crack you up, the sight gags definitely will!Enough.Go see.Thank me later."
5,Ice Age,I received the movie quickly and I have enjoyed watching it with my son. I hope that they will make more. :)
5,A truely touching and entertaining movie,"So a mammoth, a sabbertooth tiger and a sloth have to get this human back to his tribe. I know this sounds like an opening line of a joke however it is actually the basic plot of the movie ""Ice Age"". Following in the grand tradition of TOY STORY and SHREKIt is very funny and during the journey the three animals(4 if you count a rather present chipmunk ) discover something unique about themselves. The repeated gags get a little trying after a while but it is a kids movie and they don't notice if something is repeated they just laugh harder. The DVD is also jammed packed of extras that greatly enhance the experience"
5,IT WILL MAKE YOU LAUGH,ICE AGE IS A MOVIE THAT IS A TEAR JERKER BUT NOT FOR BEING SAD BUT FOR BEING SO HILARIOUS AND JUST PLAIN FUN THAT YOU WILL LAUGH TILL YOU CRY. THE CAST OF CHARACTERS BEHIND THIS GREAT MOVIE IS JUST AMAZING JOHN LEGUIZAMO IS JUST COMEDY. GREAT MOVIE I LOVE IT!!! ONE OF MY MOST FAVORITE MOVIES OF ALL TIME.
4,Cute movie! Not just for kids.,"Fun movie with an interesting premise. Not just for kids, but enjoyable for adults too. We've got all three movies in the series and the first and third films are the best."
4,Husband Likes More Than The Kids,"My husband loves this movie, it is a very good movie.My little ones 2 & 3 will watch it, but it is not their favorite.Can't wait to purchase Ice Age 2."
2,Very silly. A major disappointment.,"Considering it got such great reviews and was nominated for an Oscar, this animated film was a major disappointment. The main characters are Manfred (a mammoth), Sid (a sloth), and Diego (a saber-tooth). Diego? Anyway, they're on a quest to return a human infant to its migrating tribe. Manfred is the staunch and kindly leader, Sid is the comic relief, and Diego is the bad-guy predator turned good-guy protector of the innocent. And that's basically it. Much of the action involves patient plodding through the snow and there's way too much dreary and not very funny conversation. And some unanswered questions, like why is Manny headed back north when all the other animals are migrating south? The moral lessons lack even basic subtlety, which doesn't help, either. _The Incredibles_ and _Shrek_ were ten times better than this, and _Toy Story_ was twenty times better."
5,Makes me cry,"Love the movie, makes me cry. Lovable cast that makes me laugh. Just don't buy this movie before you buy Lilo and Stitch. I may call you a traitor then..GRRRR"
3,Good,"I normally don't buy movie DSVD's, only shows DVD's. So, I rent this one.I found it very good and enjoyable. but it's just a carbon copy of SHREK. Anyway, it has some strange quality that makes you be a cumplice and go along with the trip. I liked it."
4,This was pretty good,"I only saw part of this but it never failed to be very, veryfunny and never failed to have a touching story"
2,I don't get it...,"There are a couple of things wrong with this movie. For one, am I the only one who thinks the animation in this movie looks cheap compared to even Pixar's first efforts? The mammoth hair, the tiger's face, the lava, the snow... where's the detail? It looks like it was spray-painted on. The sloth and the squirrel didn't look too bad, though. I guess Pixar has spoiled us to some extent.For another, the story and plot are riddled with cliche, convention, contrivances, and slapstick. The target audience for this is probably something like 3-4 year olds, not adults. They won't notice the substandard animation or lack of originality.The squirrel was without a doubt my favorite character, especially during the charade bit, but he played only a small role. The behavior of the child is almost a carbon copy of the one from Monsters Inc, only not even close to being as cute and adorable as the original."
4,"A funny movie, a new classic animated movie","This is a great original movie drawing a good cast together. Manny the Mammoth and Sid set out to return a human Baby to it parents, and along the way find themselve in many dangerous, and many comical situations. Very entertaining, great cast, and Dennis Leary does the perfect villion voice for diego. One I have had in my collection, and I have recently added Ice age: the meltdown, which is as good as this one, and is not just a commical rehash of this movie. So now that they are both out, you have to get this movie to meet the characters, and get the new movie to start to really know and understand the characters. Excellent collection."
1,Whats it about again?,after viewing this movie several times i must say that its one of those movies that just dont stick with you. thats about all i gotta say about that.
1,why the in danger baby theme?thats sick!,"this movie is centered around a sloth whose hanging around a mammoth.theryre all migrating with all the other animals.they run into a baby whose mother is killed,quite graphicly i might add,and take care of it.the baby is in almost constant danger and i think its appalling.i dont think any kid should watchn this movie.its a pixar film,but as with all corporate giants,once theyre moneys made,they get really really lazy.this is your proof.of the pixar films its easily the worst. the kids seem to go for it,but thats because they dont understand yet jusy how screwed up all this really is.i think that since the kids family is killed,this is a bit too much for little ones.who kills someones parents in a disney /pixar film anyway?the sloth is very obnoxious.so obnoxious in fact his own family abandons him.the mammoth is very grumpy.see?even the characters/' personalities stink.the real deal here is:dont waste your money!"
5,TOTALLY COOL!,"AN ELEPHANT,A WEASLE,A SABERTOOTH TIGER AND A RAT LIKE CREATURE.STRANGE COMBINATION,ISN'T IT?BUT ACTUALLY IT WAS SUPERB!A COOL MOVIE(LITERALLY)ABOUT THE AGE OF ICE BRINGS AN EXPLOSIONTO HOLLYWOOD.I HOPE EVERYONE IN THE WORLD LIKES IT!IT'S A STORY ABOUT A GROUP OF ANIMALS WHO TRY TO GIVE A BABY BACK TO IT'S PARENTS AND THERE IS A GROUP OF SABER TOTH TIGERS TO STOP THEM FROM DOING SO.WATCH THE MOVIE EVEN IF YOU HAVE TO SPEND YOUR WHOLE POCKET MONEY FOR IT.IT'S WORTH IT!"
4,One for the ages,"This is a great movie for everyone to enjoy. There's a sequel coming out soon, I hope it's as good as this one!"
3,It is OK,With all the hype online and other media sources I thought this would be better. It is OK not great.
1,Purchased CD no longer works.,I recently purchased Ice Age in February and it no longer works. I will not purchase anymore movies from Amazon.
2,"Good for kids, not so much for adults","I found the ""storyline"" to be monotonous and found myself getting up to take a quick break -- without hitting pause -- and I didn't miss much. The characters are cute and loveable, and there is some comedy and even some adventure, but they didn't last nearly long enough. The DVD does include some cute extras about the squirrel/rat that doesn't talk (Scrat) and ""Bunny"". Great cast - Ray Romano, John Leguizamo, and Denis Leary. It's a shame they wasted their time on this movie."
3,ice age,"personally, I didnt care for it much. the plot and characters were a little ""undefined"", disney or barbie movies seem to be more of my taste."
1,Well rendered but terribly written,"At first glance, it is apparent why Ice Age was so successful in theaters. The graphics are beautifully rendered, and the opening sequence is wonderful to watch. Unfortunately, at this point, the characters make the mistake of speaking and the viewer realizes that with them, only the graphics are three-dimensional. The characters are woefully unfunny, the plot derivative, and the pacing tedious. When I finish with a movie and feel Fox did better with Titan AE, I know something is wrong."
1,ice age,"I think this movie was stupid and it is more of a movie for children then teenagers and adults.Sid is an idiotic thing they try and make funny, Diego wasn't that bad, but Manny is a grumpy mamoth who hates to help other things but does. Ice Age was Monsters Inc. all over again."
5,(:,I bought this for my son and he has watched it numerous times and loves it. If your not worried about time frame as far when you'll get the product def worth the buy
4,great blue ray movie.,"I got this to have a blue ray copy of the cartoon. I have it on DVD, so this is for my personal library of movies. Blue ray is less apt to get damaged. I like buying blue ray in all my favorites. This movie was used, but in great shape as promised. Cannot complain, cost was great, and for my needs, perfect. Seller delivered as promised with quality better than expected."
5,Very good movie,The move was very good. It is good for all ages and I would recommend it to everyone to watch.
2,No Short Feature,"This may not matter to anyone else but I wanted to point out this DVD does not contain the short feature ""Gone Nutty"" from the beginning as the full length video does. I have Ice Age on VHS and have shown that feature many times to my Children's Sunday School class to illustrate the story of storing up treasures in heaven where moths and rust can't destroy. I wanted to upgrade and buy it on DVD (finally) and was disappointed when I got the DVD to find the short feature was not included in this DVD. The DVD was in good shape, good price, and if all you want is Ice Age (which most people probaby do) then this is a good buy. If you are looking for the short feature then don't buy this Single Disc Edition DVD."
4,Fun movie,My 2.5 yr old son loves this movie.I did have some trouble with the actual dvd but amazon was great replacing it.
4,Jungle Book got Snowed On.,"When I watched Ice Age, I was deeply disappointed to find out it was no different from and no better than Jungle Book. The upside to that is it's no worse than Jungle Book; and Jungle Book's a good movie; so if you haven't seen Jungle Book, you might as well watch this version: it's got cool looking snow!"
3,"Good, but Deja Vu!?","This is a good movie as far as animation goes - but the actual story line isn't very original, and I saw influences from other animated films like Skrek. It has the adult humor needed for enjoyment by parents, but simply not as original as I thought it would be."
4,Not for a teenager,"I am 17'ish.And having seen the add's in the movie theater and On-Line, i thought this could be a really funny movie, which the trailer was.Sadly enough though, the trailer was the beggining of the movie, and after that it went down hill.The animation (computer graphics) was ""OK"", it was not full of detail like some movies are, yet it does not look like it was made in a year. The sound is very peaceful in general, and fits in with the story.I was under the wrong impression of this movie, thinking it would be a comedy.Instead, it is a more child directed movie, and it might be very good because of the lack of violence and short time (1 hour 15 min, for kids with short attention spans.)The low down, is that its directed to children, and I found it rather dull, seeing how im 17.~hope this helps."
5,The kids are finally QUIET!,"My husband and I have a five year old and two 3 year olds and we have finally found a movie that will keep the kids entertained while at the same time keeping us entertained.This movie is one of the BEST Disney movies I have had the pleasure of owning. We've watched this movie once in the theatre and several times since we bought it and we are not sick of it yet, in fact it gets funnier everytime we watch it.I highly recommend this movie to those with kids and without."
3,"Good movie, but digital copy is expired","I have been getting movies that have digital copies, but when I got this one I found the digital copy code expired on 10/2010 not worth getting if you are thinking about getting this for the digital copy"
4,Re watched.,"Funny movie, I liked them all. Can be a little slow at times but was worth the rewatch wanted to be reminded of them befor I watched the new one."
5,"I ALMOST cried (I don't cry, because I'm too big of a man!)","What a great animated movie. The story teaches everyone about teamwork, sticking together, and surviving in hard times. Manfred, Sid, and Diego are instantly loveable characters and the little ""Bonebags"" will get you hooked as well. The ending is a tearjerker, and the story is a great perspective from the animal's point of view. Buy it for your little one, buy it for yourself as well!"
3,Not the best animated movie,"...But its still worth a try. Don't you hate movies that give away everything in the commericials and promotions? Well, this was one of those. Basically every funny part was exposed before the audience even sat down to watch the movie. The story line isn't that great, but the end may catch a tear with the heartfelt few."
3,"Lo-res original, does not do justice to BluRay's capabilities","This movie is reasonably old and it shows. It is very low res when compared to newer, better computer graphics movies, like Ice Age The Meltdown and Rattatouille.It shows very much like the standard DVD, without any of the high resolution features you expect from a Blu-Ray movie. You can't see the details of the hairs in Mannie (The Mamoth), Diego (the Tiger) or Sid (the Sloth).A bit disappointing in the graphics point of view.Of course, the movie is great. Buy the standard DVD version, same quality."
4,ice age,"if you enjoyed the ice age on dvd, then you will love it on blu-ray. all the colors are bright and sharp, and i don't have a lcd yet. i play all my blu-ray with my ps3.the only thing is, now i have to replace almost all my dvd with blu-ray."
5,Great for everyone in the family,My sons and I loved this when we first saw it and the special edition quickly went to the top of our 'must-get' list.This is an excellent family movie and has joined our rotating list for Friday pizza and movie nights.
3,A safe spend of your rental dollars,"Just finished watching this movie and overall, I will say that it is worth your rental dollars...IF you can't find something else to rent.The plot has been described many times over here, so I will just do a quick recap of the goods and bad:GOOD:Will keep the kids entertainedAnimated to keep the kids entertainedAmazing graphicsHumorous in spotsBADProbably won't keep the adults entertainedSlow moving in some placesFrankly, just not much too seeMy kids loved it, I really could have gone either way. I wouldn't buy the DVD since there really isn't anything special that would warrant my hard earned cash on the DVD.This was a rental for my kids, and it served it's purpose to keep them entertained. Although, I'm still trying to figure out why this was rated PG..."
1,Booooooring ZZZ z Z z z z z z z z,This movie was so boring and not funny at all. The computer animation was poor in quality. You could actually see some of the jagged edges on some of the characters. My little cousin didn't even like it and we saw it for free on the plane ride on our vacation. You should get Monsters Inc if you want something fun and entertaining.
1,An awful film,"This is easily one of the worst pieces of derivative filmmaking that I've seen in years. The character rip-offs are shameless, from the mismatched buddy pair to the horrible villains, and there's absolutely nothing redeeming in the script, which is basically nothing but a cookie-cutter story with supposedly funny jokes and visuals running throughout. This may be good for the under-five crowd, but for anyone to say that it comes anywhere close to comparing to Shrek or Toy Story or A Bug's Life or Monsters, Inc., for example, is a great disservice to these fine films. This is one to miss--I wouldn't even think of watching it for free, and if I were given a copy as a gift, I'd give it away as soon as I could to the nearest two-year-old."
1,Questionable Content,"I purchased this movie and initially thought it was pretty good. However, the behavior of the two Rhinos in the movie disturbed me a little bit. It seemed to me that they were gay, but I thought I was just seeing things, as I couldn't imagine any reason why someone would want to put that in there. I decided to do a search on the Internet and when 80% of all reviews made mention of the ""gay Rhinos"", I knew it wasn't just me. One review even went so far to say that the movie ""deserved a salute"" for including them.Aside from that, I thought the movie was a pretty good, but I wasn't interested in having a movie with ""the first gay couple in the history of children's animation,"" (as another reviewer put it), so I returned it. But if you aren't morally opposed to something like that, then you'll probably enjoy this movie."
1,I Hate Raymond,"The animation is awful. The story is boring and predictable. Worst of all is the casting of Raymond as the mammoth. They should have gotten the big dude who plays his brother on the tv show. He probably would have worked cheaper, too."
1,rather disapointing,"naive. predictable. boring. seen it before.The big strong mammoth protecting the small annoyngly witty sloth.Seen this: Shrek. Even the first encounter between mammoth/sloth and Shrek/donkey is the same! So boring...Three male characters (mammoth, sloth, tiger) care for a little lost baby.Seen this too: ""Three man around the crib"". Not convincing, not at all.Some suspense related to the ""double agent"" Diego the tiger: Boring predictable. We expect Diego will do the right thing at the end, and he lives to our expectation. Seen this in million movies.It is not enough to draw cute creatures with big eyes to make a good story.In one sentence, this movie is an overrated product of the film industry, you have lost nothing if you have never seen it.Does anyone remember the classic writer, who said:""For children we must write books just like for adults, but better."""
4,Grain of Salt,"Kaplan's intro book isn't bad and it isn't great. It's a good overview before you really start digging into the actual LSAT questions. I felt that it got my mind warmed up as to what the LSAT would be like and gave me some basic tips to think over.There's no way this should be your only study material, however it fills an important role. If you're studying on your own you should have some sort of book that gives you the basics of the LSAT...whether that be Kaplan, Princeton Review, Nova, etc.I liked to think of my self study in several stages:1. Intro to the LSAT2. General logical reasoning and analytical skill development3. Focussed practice on specific types of LSAT questions4. Full preptests5. Further focus on specific LSAT skill areasThis book does a decent job of addressing that Intro to the LSAT but alone it's not going to prepare you adequately to take the LSAT."
3,"Confidence-building, but not too useful","The Kaplan book is chatty, easy to read, and confidence building, but a lot of the information is just not that useful. They write, for instance, don't waste a lot of time drawing elegant charts during the logic games section. Or, in the same chapter, ""With Logic Games, you must remember that identifying the type of game and understanding the subsequent flow of action are the keys to the kingdom of point-scoring."" Good ideas both, but as we used to say in grade school - Duh! The book is certainly not a total waste of time, and not having read any other LSAT books I don't have much to compare it to, but unless a person is feeling very insecure or dimwitted, he/she could probably find more useful advice elsewhere."
1,Hoax.,"THe 2005 edition of the book is the exact same as the 2004 edition. Even the back cover of the book says ""Kaplan 2004"". see for yourself. The only thing they changed was the cover and the copyright page. They should recall the books and actually put out a 2005 edition. I also thought some of the answers or explanations were wrong according to their own standards. The only thing good about it is that it's better than nothing."
5,Excellent,"Finally I've got this CD, wich been out of stock for a long time. Tompall's lovely voice still thrills everone, even at his older days....."
3,TV Shelf,"The legs of the shelf were flimsy,and did not adjust enough to fit my tv. I had to ""modify"" it to work. Overall, it was a nice looking and sturdy shelf, with exception to the plastic legs."
2,Loosing the magick...,"The book was OK but only and just OK. Usually, books with Andrews' name on it are pretty decent though not as good as V C Andrews' own works. I was quite diappointed when I read this ""Misty"" book. I agree with the others and think that the ghostwriter should stick to longer, more intruiging novels b/c these miniseries are lacking the magick that the previous books had. I will keep reading however because I LOVE V C ANDREWS! :)"
5,This book was really interesting.,I thought this book was extremely captivating and i could notput it down once i started. V.C Andrews is probably my favoriteauthor because she can keep the reader interested in the book.Overall the book was great but there were some obscene parts and i think this book should be for teens and older although the reading level is for children.
3,"Good series, but to short","I'm enjoying this new miniseries pretty much but am very dissappointed in a couple of areas. One is the books are ridiculously short, and the second is I'm very sick of waiting for them to come out once a month. These books can be read in about an hour and i hate waiting month to month. Although they are enjoyable to read"
1,The worst V.C. Andrews book I have ever read.,"You can tell that this new series is not something that V.C.Andrews would have written. I have always enjoyed reading her books, but these short stories are the pits.I think they are being written for preteens. Are the owners looking for a younger generation to read their books. They have lost me as a reader."
1,Very Disappointing,"First of all, this is not a book for a person 4-8 years old. I don't think a person under fourteen should be reading it. The subject matter is NOT for a young person. Also, I've read all of V. C. Andrew's books, and I'm getting very disappointed. The books are getting worse and worse. I dislike the mini-series. I want to know what happened to the really good books that she used to turn out!"
1,the orphans and wildflowers should never have been written!!,"What is with Andrew Neiderman producing these R. L. Stine wannabe books? Why can't he get back into the V. C. Andrews style we all love, with adult novels, not these stupid, petty little books about whiny girls. V. C. Andrews' name as already lost many readers because of that disaterous orphans series, I love V. C. so much I'll never stop reading them, no matter how pathetic they will get, and Misty was beyond pathetic. Neiderman will never cast a spell like Dark Angel or Petals on the Wind, but he did a job well done with Music in the Night and The Dawn and Ruby series. Not everybody who reads V. C. Andrews is 13, some are 19 like me and like FULL novels, not 100 pagers.~Tom Nordlum"
3,Not as good as I anticipated,"I just got this book today and read it today. It started out pretty good but I thought Misty was a little two sided. She seemed like a sex manic and that bothered me because her and I are about the same age but I don't act like that all. It was a dissapointment after the first miniseries. This book is told by Mistys point of view as she is telling the story and the other girls ask questions. I will continue to read the other books in this series, I just hope they get better. Jade seems interesting."
1,"Ghostwriter too ""Misty""-eyed to see problems?","When I first heard that this book was going to be the begining of another mini series (like the Orphan series), I thought, ""What is this ghost writer thinking? Not everyone who reads V.C. Andrews is 13."" I tried to give the book the benefit of the doubt and this book was a little more interesting then the Orphan series. I am hoping the other books in the series will surprise me, but I can help and think that V.C. Andrews would not have written these types of books and would have stayed the adult psychological thriller/horror route instead of going Sweet Valley High."
4,I am sure this one will be as wonderful as all the others.,"I started reading V.C. when I was a pre-teen. The Heaven series was my first and all time favorite. I have always enjoyed every one of her books. Even though they are a mini-series, you can read one book and still walk away satisfied. I am sure that ""Misty"" will live up to all the rest."
4,Much Better Than The Last Mini-series!,"Being a huge fan of V.C. Andrews made me realize that she is not alive to write this material, therefore it is not going to be the same format as her own. Misty was actually pretty good for a series book, although I did feel weird sitting in public reading it after I saw it was ranked for 10 yr-olds! I think I read Flowers in the Attic when I was 14. Quite a big difference in the text. I am anxious to start STAR."
2,Awful,"I am so disappointed with the latest VC Andrews 'Series.' It is so boring. I regretted that I bought the Orphans series, which now sits in a storage box, never to see the light of day again. I think that the Wildflowers series is slightly better than the Orphans series, in the fact that it is more readable. However, Misty was a shallow character with no depth. We don't know anything about her. She has a dysfunctional family and she has lost her virginity. Who really cares? It's so dull. Where are the old VC Andrews style books, the gothic style which hasn't been there for so long. I didn't buy Misty. I borrowed it from the library instead. DO THE SAME!!!"
3,OK but I'm not a child,I have to say I agree with the one who said the books where more for young adults. I did however like the book and did read the second book in the series and will more than likely read them all. For the simple fact I want to know what happens to the girls. I also agree that the books should be longer and more V.C. Andrews style. The last series about the Orphans was closer than this. Not that close but closer. All in all I would still recommend it ... to a younger crowd.
5,what I feel about the new wildflowers series.,"Compared to the rest of V.C. Andrews novels I thought that ""Wildflowers"" is a great series that I can't wait to get my hands on the next book that comes out. I just wish that they were longer so they would last for a couple of days instead of just a couple of hours. As for Misty I can relate to her since my parents are also divorced. But, I didn't have to go through all the pain that she has gone through and I'm glad for that."
2,Eh.,"As a novel on its own for teenage readers - and I WAS a young teenager back in 1999 when this book came out - it was a decent read. Back then I still got excited every time a new VCA book came out. I was a bit disappointed that Neiderman hadn't gone back to a full series after finishing this one, but by gum, I still got excited!However now ten years later, I'm no longer excited. Compared to the crud that Mr. Neiderman is now writing under VCA's name (Gemini, Shadows, Flower, Attic, Delia, and now Heavenstone series) Misty is definitely a better read in its own right. However, as a VCA book it's unacceptable. Yeah, Misty has problems, her dad and mom hate one another, blah blah, but she sounds as if she just likes to be rebellious on top of the justified anger she feels towards her parents. For a tween book, it's not bad. 2.5/5 stars."
1,She's so bad....she ran away on a Mini Motorcycle!,"Misty is the first in the Wildflowers series, and floral metaphors are scattered throughout the five part series of poor little rich girls. In Dr. Marlowe's office the girls will explore the pain of their past. And yada, yada, yada. The book tags and summary are so melodramatic it's laughable, and sadly, the inside of the book isn't much better. For 150 pages, Misty whines about her life, using endless description, and clichéd metaphors, that a real person who was narrating her tale never would have spoken. At the end of the book, we know that there is still more torment, for Star will be speaking tomorrow."
1,Weak,"One word...weak. It's a good book if your 13 or 14 I guess but it doesn't come close to her stories. Granted that most of her stories are about rape, incest and sex but at least the twists and turns of the plots made it better. The entire Wildflower series pretty much followed the suite. Ghostwriter can't seem to hold a candle to V.C. Andrews writing style."
3,"Good, but doesn't really interest me.","This novel is the first of The Wildflower series. It is about four girls who share stories about their past. This series is based on a 16-years-old girl named, Misty; she shares her life problems, mainly focusing on her parents' divorce. Misty also introduces a little bit about the other girls and their therapist, Dr. Marlowe. Of all the novels that I have read by V.C. Andrews, this one wasn't really as interesting as the last book I picked up by her. I recommend this book to any teen who wants to know what it's like being in the middle of parents' divorce from a one-person point of view."
1,It's not out yet people...,"So I thought that I should balance out the reviews w/ a bad one... chances are that it will be pretty bad considering the last miniseries. Hopefully, though, I will be wrong."
2,Didn't really hold my interest,"Although I enjoyed the series overall, I did not care for this book. The whole time I was reading it, I kept asking myself, ""What is this girl complaining about? So her parents don't like each other. Get over it."" In my opinion, Misty did not fit in with the other characters and appeared weak to me. It is obvious why this book was the first of the series. I do have to admit that I did like her humor though."
3,It's not bad,"This book is not a horrible book to a child like myself,(which is something I don't like to recognize. But after reading this book I am not so afraid to admit to things). I am only twelve. This book is sort of intense. I still like the other novels better. I like to read adult books. The only reason I said it was okay was that I come from a ""broken"" family too. Some of these things are very much the same as what happens and has happened to me. They're close enough to where I can relate to. I like to look at books in an adult perspective though. These books are so short. I like books that capture your mind so that you can't put it down. I just recently became a V.C. Andrews fan. I can polish of these books is two hours flat. This book was so short could probably finish the series in two hours. As I said before, this book is okay. But compared to an ORIGINAL V.C. Andrews novel, this book is not one of my favorites."
3,The Klee Universe,We were fortunate to have obtained a windfall of 9 Klee books:Phaidon's book falls square in the middle of your standard KLee photo - biographies. A quick concise all inclusive no frills biography opens. Followed by 48 large color plates with detailed descriptions. Therein you pick up some more Klee facts along the way.pluses (+) : a no where else seen photo of his wife Lily.minuses (-) : The editor picked too many dark canvases. Not allowing us to appreciate Klee's color explorations. With only 48 plates its a fast moving art book.Please see our other KLee reviews.
2,non-standard connector,"As the last reviewer said, this device does not fit a normal phone jack. I wish I had found this out before I bought it.(I ended up getting a Krown Phone Flasher, which has a standard plug and a jack built in so you don't need a splitter.)"
2,"Works, but has a non-standard connector","The connector on this light is a 4P9C (RJ9/Handset), most phones use an RJ11. I had to cut the connector off and put an RJ11 on. If you don't have connectors, and a crimping tool avoid this product.It could have been a mistake..."
4,Neat Gadget,"I got this for work so I could listen to my music loud and still know when my phone was ringing for sure. It lights up whenever the phone rings just like it should. My only complaint is that it did not come with a splitter to connect it along with the existing phone, luckily I had one already though so I didn't have to spend the extra $5 to get one."
3,Wrong connector,"Like everyone else said, the connector on it is that you would find on a wired phone handset. Can be rewired to function, but take this into account when purchasing."
4,Works just fine,"Yes, mine did come with the wrong connector, which I had more or less expected having read the reviews before I ordered it. But after I replaced the connector, the light worked just fine."
2,Wrong Plug,"This item has the wrong plug on it. Instead of the RJ-11 plug which is necessary to use the item as indicated on the package directions, it has a smaller, handset plug. I had to cut off the the plugs and replace them with the proper plug, a RJ-11. If you don't have the ability to rewire these lights, I would steer clear of them. Once they were rewired, they worked as advertised."
2,Ring Sensor,We tried this product for our Video Phone to be able to flash when ring as it didnt success well
4,A good introduction to Meditation,"The Ramakrishna Order is an worldwide organization of monks started by the disciples of Sri Ramakrishna, one of the brightest stars that rose in the Indian Spiritual horizon during the end of the 19th century. This Order is known for its rational and catholic approach to religion. The monks of the Order are one of the most authentic sources of information and inspiration on Religion, Meditation and Spiritual life. This book gives a good account of the theory and practice of Meditation. The book contains several inspiring and thought provoking articles which will set the person in the proper perspective, mood and understanding to move towards higher goals through Meditation."
5,Ballroom Dance Instruction by Kyle and Susan Webb,"To those people who are looking for excellent instruction and not hurried or rushed from one phase of the dance instruction to another, these are the videos for you. The dance steps are gone over quite a few times, both for the men and women and executed slowly so you can understand the instruction in an excellent way. Tressa Mason has excellent videos that I also have, but her instruction is not for the average or slow learner. They are fine if you are an experienced dancer, then I say use Tressa's videos. BUT if you are starting out in ballroom dancing and / or brushing up on steps than Kyle and Susan Webb's are the videos to use."
2,OK for those consumed with Western-style therapy,"I agree with a previous reviewer in that this is a book by a psychiatrist who is looking to reconcile the tenets of his practice with Tibetan buddhism. I have read a lot on buddhism and this series of interviews really misses the mark. The author keeps ""pestering"" (my words) the Dalai Lama with situation specific strategies and then asks ""What if that is too difficult?"" ""What if that doesn't work, what then?"". That's not what Buddhism is about! To me, that's the problem with Western methods, people can't see that an overarching philosophy can be your basis and then you don't have to remember which little tactic to use for each situation. Read something like ""Buddhism plain & simple"" or pick a book about a particular zen monk and you may walk away a little wiser."
2,A book for the non-buddhist believer,"Firstly, this book is not by the Dalai Lama. It is written by Michael Cutler who includes his interviews with the Dalai Lama.I found this book frustrating. Dr. Cutler interviews the Dalai Lama and then tries to support the Dalai Lama's message with his own personal experiences and scientific research. As a buddhist, I know why and how the Dalai Lama is ""happy"" and I don't need a psychiatrist to prove it. My message to Dr. Cutler, relax and believe!"
1,Slow as Molasses,"A clumsy attempt that does not do the Dalai Lama, or his message, justice. Cutler comes across as a self absorbed, immature elitist -- the stereotypical example of a person with a lot of book learning and no common sense. And, judging from his childish reactions to the people he encounters (the couple in the restaurant, the lady on the airplane,...), I certainly wouldn't rush to this guy for therapy!"
3,Do you have a library card?,"I'd rather listen to the Dalai Lama live when I can hear his hearty laugh.This book was interesting, but as I'm not into Buddhism too much, it didn't appeal to me personally.As far as spirituality goes, I'd much rather read Deepak Chopra or Echart Tolle."
1,A CIA funded lama tells you how to be happy....,A CIA funded lama tells you how to be happy....Isn't it funny?Dalai Lama has been suppressing other buddhist sectors in India....But here he tells you how to forgive and be happy....
2,At least a step removed from the real thing,"I picked up this book thinking it had been written by the Dalai Lama. The cover is misleading. Look closely, the Dalai Lama probably wasn't anywhere around where this book was being written. I found the author's insights to be somewhat shallow. And the book is about what the author thinks he knows about the Dalai Lama. There are many better books on Tibetan Buddhism, even for someone who wants light reading, than this one."
1,The Art of Happiness: A Handbook for Living,"Very disappointing book. I just cannot understand why the Dalai Lama was involved in this farse. Every reader must have bought the book expecting to read about the Dalai Lama, instead all we get is Mr Cutler's shallow insights and his persistent and futile attempts as a psychologist to explain things that are unexplainable from that point of view. Worst Christmas gift I have ever received!"
1,meh,"I feel a little sacrilegious saying so, but I was left wanting more. I was looking for some sort of secret or something. Silly me. I was looking for what I felt after reading Live Like A Fruit Fly. Like I can conquer the world."
5,Good reading for good living.,"As an asian growing up as a Buddhist, I found the insights and Buddhism doctrines be nothing new to me. Personally I'd recommend the reader to ignore the psychiatrist's comments. He didn't seem to quite catch up on the true Buddhism concept..not until the latter half of the book. I first decided to read the book because I'd like to see how a westerner view an eastern concept/philosophy. For that purpose the book gave me a pretty good view and in some way helped me better understand the western thinking and culture. I enjoyed the latter half of the book more for one I think because Dr. Culter started to have a better grasp of the whole concept (sometimes I wondered if he didn't quite get it or just asked questions with an average reader's mindset on the subject in mind). To me it helped repeat and remind myself of the proper way to live..as a Buddhist."
1,Hated it!,"I just finished reading the Art of Happiness and in a nutshell, I hated it. Nice way to earn a quick buck Cutler."
2,A Mediocre Self-Help Book,"Visit my Blog if you like my review: [...]The Art of Happiness is a book born from the interviews of the author (a psychiatric named Dr Howard C. Cutler) with his Holiness the Dalai Lama.The author tries to fill the whole book with some (mostly brilliant) Dalai Lama's declarations, made in their interviews and in his public appearances.It's true that there are some interesting thoughts in the book (mainly in the first part: The Purpose of Live), but the rest of the book has a lack of intensity.The Dalai Lama seems a very interesting person, but the author doesn't have the ability to suck the juice of those declarations, and the best part of the book are transcriptions of the own Dalai Lama's words.I don't recommend the reading of this book, however, some Dalia Lama's ideas are excellent."
2,Your Holiness please find a better writer!,"The ideas in this book were simple yet important, and it is useful to remind oneself of them. I think this book would have been far more interesting if someone other than Howard Cutler had written it. His style is annoying and he tries to intepret events in his own life to demonstrate the Dalai Lamas teachings, which he manages to do with very little insight. He comes accross as a culture and philosphy starved westerner, completely awed by this very basic eastern philosophy.If you are really interested in the Dalai Lamas teachings, I am sure there are some better written books out there."
5,Dr. Cutler is a gentle genius!,"God - I mean Buddha - bless Dr. Cutler! Thank you for at last acting like me and asking the questions that finally allowed me to understand what Buddhism was all about. I never understood the Dalai Lama, but I knew there was something wrong with me - and now at last I have some inkling of his wisdom and what it can mean to my everyday life. I am baffled by previous reviews misunderstanding of Dr. Cutler - without asking those questions, we could never have gained such an understanding, and been able to relate the teachings directly to ourselves. What a blessing for all of us that this book was written!"
4,First on compassion,"Howard C Cutler asks some good questions for each of Dalai Lama's assertions. When Dalai Lama says that the goal of life is happiness HCC asks then why are we not naturally inclined towards it. Expanding on Compassion when DL says it involves opening yourself to other's suffering, HCC is quick to ask as to why would we take on another's burden, while we are trying to get rid of ours. Instead of one way info flow, HCC's persuant questions, make the reader linger on thoughts and know better."
5,AWE INSPIRING,"I have for a while been looking to make some positive changes in my life and this was the book that helped me do it. It has changed my entire outlook on life, the way I see other people as well as myself. The methods the Dalai Lama presents at first seem simple, too simple, then when you go out and try them you find that not only are they simple, but right on the money. It's good to finally read a book that teaches love, compassion, empathy, gentleness, and kindness. I would recommend this book to anybody."
4,the Art of Happiness,"A wonderfully simplistic yet also profound philosophy that can be applied to anyonne's life. It's Buddist values are explained in such a way that Western thinkers can understand and contemplate....probably for the rest of your life! The author's rantings are sometimes helpful & sometimes intrusive - if you can get past this you should be able to experience the peace, calm & well considered philosophies of one of the wisest men of our time"
3,As expected,"Good advice. I took several useful ideas away with me such as ""using what is in the room"" to solve my issues. But otherwise, it is quite what I expected."
4,Big help,"Helped me deal with my self, change my perspective and learn some new things about budhism and the dahli lama. Great read, keeps your attention and helps you figure out new ways of deeling with difficult situations so they don't completely stress you out."
1,Cutler's share of the pie,"This book was a major disappointment. I am familiar with books written solely by the Dalai Lama, such as the ""Library of Tibet"" series, which are much more engrossing and have much more substance than Cutler's book. Cutler attempts (successfully, sadly) to have his share of the profitable market that involves the Dalai Lama's writings. The book is insipid, does not try to explain any important issue in the light of Buddhist philosophy, and only rehashes issues that several other westerners already wrote about. It's another big ego trip: we keep hearing time and again about his opportunities to be with the Dalai Lama. What a shame, Cutler. I sold the book as soon as I finished it."
1,False Advertising,"Howard C. Cutler knows how to sell a book - stick a big picture of the Dalai Lama on the cover and exploit the heck out of him. This book was very disappointing. I was expecting a book on the wisdom of the Dalai Lama's teachings. Instead I read a discouraging rendition of a psychiatrist's struggle to understand something he obviously just does not get. He blunders through interview after interview with the Dalai Lama spending much more time relating his own interpretations of ""The Art of Happiness"" than passing on what the Dalai Lama has taught. If you want to read a rude, arrogant psychiatrist's version of happiness, this book is for you. If you would rather hear what the expert has to say, I suggest looking somewhere else."
3,Good ideas but...,"I got this book because I really wanted to read the advice on relationships and happiness from the Dalai Lama. It does have a lot of good ideas on how to live happily and treat others with respect. It's my first time reading a book ""by"" the Dalai Lama, and I'm impressed with the way he is portrayed as respectful of all people and all religions. The quotations by the Dalai Lama are definitely inspiring and refreshing. Unfortunately, the ""extra"" commentary by Mr. Cutler is very annoying. Perhaps there are some who would be interested in all of the doubts and distractions Mr. Cutler describes (he is a psychiatrist, and regularly provides ""case studies"" throughout the book), but I was more interested in what the Dalai Lama had to say about the questions Cutler raises. For my part, I would recommend this book as ""(diet) self-improvement,"" but it's not for someone who really wants to learn about Buddhist philosophy."
2,Disappointed,"I was surprisingly disappointed with this book. What I wanted to read was words from the Dalai Lama; what I ended up reading was mostly the words of Dr. Cutler. It seemed more like a psychology book, referring to studies and so forth. There were pages and pages of words by Cutler, then a couple of paragraphs from Dalai Lama. Definitely not what I thought it would be"
4,The Problem of Two Authors,"I found this book to be deeply moving. The Dalai Lama's teachings revealed to me the profound problems we have with disconnectivity in our society. My one criticism of the book is that the co-author, Howard Cutler, did not seem to appreciate what the Dalai Lama was saying. His anecdotes (and his questions) revealed that he had not grasped the essence of what the Dalai Lama was trying to teach him. His commentary, interspersed with wonderful interviews with the Dalai Lama, can be quite intrusive, and counteracting the feelings of harmony and enlightenment that the Dalai Lama's lessons produce."
5,Excellent,A great book that really creates a clear set of guidelines for how buddhist thought can help inform and creat a sense of inner peace. I thought the author did a good job of being something of a western foil/skeptic to many of the Dalai Lama's ideas - it made the book come across more believably.
2,Do Not Judge This Book By It's Cover.,"I just received this book in the mail. When I glanced through it, I was very disapointed with Dr Cutler. His Holiness the Dalai Lama should not have been listed as an author of this book."
5,The Title speaks for itself!,I bought this book when it first came out in 1998. A very good friend of mine is going through a troubling time in his life and when he confided in me his problems this book first came to mind. Not being able to find my copy after moving from California to Kansas I knew Amazon would have it in stock as they always do.This book is not the first but is a very good teaching of Buddhism as seen through the eye's of the Dahlai Lama's eastern philosophy and a mixture of Western psychology brought together with an openness that works well with each other.
5,A great read from a great teacher,"This book presents the Buddhist vision of true happiness and peace.I also recommend 'The Path of Mindfulness Meditation' available through Amazon, for a practical look at the path of mindfulness, which is central to the Buddhist path towards happiness."
4,Simple yet profound,"A very easy book to read and a great antidote to the excesses of our western life style of consumption and greed.It provides an easily digestible look at practical ways to live simply and happily.It can seem patronising and too simple in places, it discusses things that are pretty obvious to most but that is because there is much truth in what the Dalai Lama says and his philosophy is pretty simple.Live Happily!"
4,Heartfelt advice from a wise man,"The Dalai Lama is awesome! He has such great advice about a lot of the things that people concern themselves with. Of course, he lives in an entirely different world than we do in the USofA, but his principles are very fundamental. Compassion is universal.When I read ""The Art of Happiness"" I was in a really bad state of mind. I was depressed and suicidal. He helped me get through a lot of my own problems and make me into a more balanced person. It's still tough - especially when other people are such a-holes and have zero compassion for anyone or anything - but I'm going to keep trying to be the way the Dalai Lama says to be and hope for the best. ""Why?"" by Phil Nery was a great book for dealing with depression and suicide, too. Completely different manner than ""The Art of Happiness"" but just as effective."
3,somewhat useful,"This book and ""Healing Anger"" have pretty much the same content, so don't buy both. ""Healing Anger"" is organized in the form of eight talks and question-and-answer sessions over a four day period, whereas ""The Art of Happiness"" is organized topically. For this reason ""The Art of Happiness"" may be easier to use if you are interested in exploring particular topics. The downside of ""The Art of Happiness"" for me was Howard Cutler. I found his additions to what the Dalai Lama has to say didn't bring much value. What I was looking for in both books was mental exercises, and these are found in ""Healing Anger"" in each of the eight sessions in between the talk and the Q&A, so these are easier to find in ""Healing Anger"". I was a bit disappointed that neither book contained detailed treatments of some of the exercises referred to, such as the ""seven-point cause and effect"" and ""equalization and exchange"". These can be found on the internet by googling ""Developing the Mind of Great Capacity""."
4,Very inspriring! This is for angry people also.,"Lucky me, I don't have to read but only listen to my cassette tapes. Yes, they still work. :-)If I could find a CD, I would send it to someone who is still angry about something...I like the story of a woman who has lost a loved one and later realized that she wasn't the only one; and finally accepted the loss of her child...The guide on overcoming ""anger"" is an eye opener.I would give this a 5-star if Mr. Cutler's voice didn't sound like it ""trembles.""This is something you can pass on to your children or anyone special in your life, whether the recipient is happy or angry."
3,Nothing New Here,"This book is just o.k. As you should be able to tell from our Depression plagued society we are apparently unappy people always looking for the key to happiness. Your not going to find it in this book, in fact, unless you have never read another self-help book on being happy, your not going to find any major epiphanies here. I forced myself to finish it much like homework once it became apparant that there just wasn't much of anything in this book that hasn't been covered time and time again before. And, as is pointed out, it's actually written by a Psychiatrist that interviewed the Dalai Lama and mixed what he was told with his own observations. There's nothing wrong with reading this book really but I came away from it with nothing new so don't look for some ancient wisdom that will change your life in it."
2,Read the quotes,"It seems somewhat strange and perverse to write something negative about such a positive book, but I think, like most readers, I wanted to read more from the Dalai Lama and less from Cutler. I found the only way I could get through it was by just skipping Cutler's prose and reading the Dalai Lama quotes. There is a need for a meaningful dialogue between buddhism and psychology, but I'm afraid Cutler is not the right person for the job, or perhaps, the problem is that the popularization of the topic in the book makes it far too simplistic and trivial.Having said all that, I learned a great deal from the Dalai Lama himself. I found his quotes to be incredibly useful and meaningful. I wish there were more in the book on the different kinds of meditation exercises that the Dalai Lama teaches. That is a book that should be written. If anyone knows of one, please let me know."
1,Keep your day job Dr. Cutler!,"I will never but another book by Dr. Cutler again. I found Dr. Cutler's sarcastic comments extremely annoying and distracting to the book's overall content. I wish that he would not have been so obvious about his doubtfulness of the Dalai Lama's teaching as being actually applicable to ""real"" life. Don't quit your day job Dr. Cutler!"
1,Keep your day job Dr. Cutler,Please do not write another book Dr. Cutler. I was hoping to read a book that the Dalai Lama has written and to find that an American M.D. had tried to write about something he really knows nothing about was a truly disappointing. Keep your day job Dr. Cutler.
3,"It's a good book, but it is not what it is advertised to be.","I found the book to be fascinating and very informative. My one criticism is that the book is pitched as a Dali Lama product, or at least co-written by the Dali Lama. It was not. It was a book by Dr. Cutler that espoused his own views and subject matter. The Dali Lama was used as prime source of material for the book, but was not a prime author.All that said, Dr. Cutler does a fairly good job, and the book held my interest. However, all it really did was whet my appetite to read a book that was really authored by the Dali Lama."
4,Happiness East And West,"This book is the result of a series of talks between Dr. Howard Cutler, a psychiatrist, and the Dalai Lama. The Dalai Lama states that the very purpose of our life is to seek happiness. The conversations essentially tell us what is necessary to bring that about.Being a kind, compassionate, and loving human being helps. What was a bit of a surprise to me was how much of what the Dalai Lama said sounded like cognitive behavioral therapy. Evidently, when it comes to happiness, the gap between East and West isn't that wide. There seems to be general agreement that happiness is an inside job and is very related to the inner dialogue we have going with ourselves all day long. If we want to be happy, the Dalai Lama gives us a pretty good road map to follow.This is a worthwhile book."
3,The Art of Happiness,The interesting and inspirational parts of this book are when the co-author Dr. Cutler is having conversations with the Dalai Lama. Good parts are also his observations of Dalai Lama. Every once in a while though he gets involved in quoting studies and statistics for 2-5 pages. When I run into these sections I skip over them.
1,Dr Cutler's Prism Has No Colors <No Stars>,"The Dalai Lama didn't write this book. An American psychoanalyst wrote it. All of the good doctor's observations and analysis are presented as somehow 'echoing' the ideas of the thing being analyzed, the patient: Dalai Lama.The book is therefore, a hoax. The Dalai Lama, as Cutler concedes early on, has several good books which explain his religion (which is were the truth of this book begins, and ends).This book is clearly not one of them.But the paranoid political attributions of some other reviews I have seen in here are not at all in the book."
1,To the readers from Argentina & New York City,"I am a Buddhist Tibetan woman living in the U.S. and I just want to say that I am appalled at these two readers who have missed the purpose of the Dalai Lama's preachings towards ""The Art of Happiness"". Why must you criticize and demean the opinion of others? Have you learned nothing from the Dalai Lama's words? Are the thoughts of others not as legitimate as your own? I believe that the purpose of this site is to comment on the book not to criticize the thoughts of others. I know that if the Dalai Lama could read these self-indulgent comments he would also be disappointed that his words have achieved nothing towards inner happiness for the readers from Argentina and New York City. A suggestion: If you don't agree with the opinion of another, let that be your personal challenge towards personal growth to achieving enlightenment. Otherwise, keep your abusive comments to yourself."
1,"Dr. Cutler MINUS 5 STARS (Nice picture, says it all...)",I wish there had been an easy way to separate the thougths of the Dalai Lama from the endless platitudes of Dr. Cutler. To think that people actually pay to get advice from Dr. Cutler seems absurd! This book is for the most part filler and inane anecdotes. The only times Dr. Cutler hits the mark is when he points out the stupidity and shamefulness of his own questions. I know 5 year olds with a better insight on life than him.
3,I was not impressed,Its true I would have liked to hear alot more from the Dalai Lama himself.I think this book sums up some very basic points on Psychology and Buddhism in general.I expected alot more.Take Care...
1,Psycho Babble,"This book - really written by Cutler - is the worst kind of psycho-babble. Self-absorption is not the key to happiness. In fact, happiness is not the key. Right living is - something a psychologist couldn't possibly understand."
5,One of the best buys I've made,This is such an outstanding well-written book not to mention interesting. If you're looking to see the startings of Buddhism is I would recommend this book! Or if you're just curious!
5,One of the best,"At the time of writing this review, Amazon.com lists 2213 books on happiness. This is one of the best, and I should know. I haven't read all 2213, but I did read dozens when researching my own book, Climb your Stairway to Heaven: the 9 habits of maximum happiness. This was one of the best that I read.If I could describe The Art of Happiness in one sentence, here it is: This book weaves philosophy and science into a strong rope on which to climb.In fact, it is an excellent complement to my own book, as they both are truer to psychological science than most books on happiness, but the Dala Lama approaches the subject from a philosophical and inspirational perspective, whereas I chose to be more entertaining and motivational.I enjoyed the book, and I will read it again.David Leonhardt, author of Climb your Stairway to Heaven: the 9 habits of maximum happiness (also available at Amazon.com)"
1,A MAJOR DISSAPPOINTMENT,"The Art of Happiness by none other than the Dalai Lama! I couldn't wait to get the book and start reading. What A MAJOR DISSAPPOINTMENT! Boring, lacks the insights and wisdom I expected. I honestly could not force myself to continue reading this book!!! This book continues to sell only because of its title and the picture on the cover!If you want to be enlightened read anything by Zen master Thich Nhat Hahn, I loved ""Peace Is Every Step: The Path of Mindfulness in Everyday Life"".If you want to know about the nature of happiness read ""Authentic Happiness"" by Martin Seligman."
3,"70% Cutler, 30% Dalai Lama","The Dalai Lama puts forth many practical and insightful ideas on avoiding those things that make us unhappy. Dr. Howard Cutler who co-wrote the book chose to relate his ideas and experiences to give examples highlighting the teachings of the Dalai Lama. This is not a bad approach. However, the method in which it is done is too invasive, disrupting the flow the book. As a result, the book is 70% Dr. Cutler and 30% Dalai Lama. I managed to wade through it only because the pearls of wisdom from the Dalai Lama are worth digging out. His techniques for overcoming impatience, anger and hate really work. I find myself using them in my daily commute and at work."
1,Misses the mark,"If you want to know about the Dalai Lama, and his message, in my opinion you would be better off to look elsewhere. This book gives you the Dalai Lama through the eyes of the author (Cutler), who unfortunately attempts to make us think drivel is special and profound, with sneaky (intentional or not) tricks. In the following example, Cutler prefaces something lame the Dalai Lama says with this: (P.62) "" he sat examining the human mind with the scrutiny of a scientist"". Huh? How do you know that Dr. Cutler? At other times a twinkle in the eye or a warm laugh is supposed to substitute for actual information. My take is that the Dalai Lama himself began early on to tire of Cutler (We must stop now, I am tired). I didn't finish this book, as it was unconvincing of anything interesting. I found the book a disappointment."
5,True to the Teachings of the Dalai Lama,"I don't understand why some people were so upset with Cutler. Yes, he did benefit from his audience with the Dalai Lama. Yes, the sales of his book did benefit from having the Dalai Lama as a co-author. Yes, he is holding workshops with the materials in the book, and he is probably compensated for his efforts. But, was the book true to the teachings of the Dalai Lama? In my opinion, the answer is YES! In his book, Cutler explored the ideas of the Dalai Lama with his own reasoning and training and found them to be sound. Note that that is the approach that the Dalai Lama proposed to his audience. We were told not to accept Buddhist teaching by faith, but rather examine them with our own reasoning. Adopt them only if they are reasonable to us. So, Cutler was true to the teachings of the Dalai Lama. People who are upset with Cutler should reexamine their motivations. By the way, being mindful of our motivations is also a teaching of the Dalai Lama."
4,A Light Discussion On Happiness,"This book is a dialogue between psychiatry (Cutler) and Tibetan Buddhism (Dalai Lama). Despite claiming to be a ""handbook"" it is not full of 'how-to-do-it' gems. It is more a philosophic exchange on the subject of happiness. As it is written for a western audience some of the metaphysical elements of Buddhism, such as karma and reincarnation, receive only a brief mention. Compassion, however, receives a lengthy treatment, as does living in the moment and dealing with anger. There are a few meditation exercises included.The book is very readable and maintained my interest all the way through. If I have a criticism it is that the book does not contain enough psychiatry or enough Buddhism. Some how it seems to fall between the two disciplines. It reads like a first contact encounter between East and West, rather than a well developed, deeply contemplated thesis."
3,Some worthy thoughts among the self-help babble,"Don't get me wrong... I think Cutler's intentions are highly respectable. However, I doubt that the lines between Bhuddist Philosophy and Western Psychoanalysis can be easily connected. Our way of thinking is too causal, too linear. At best, Cutler dresses up a handful of his cases in what seems to be analogies for the words of the Dalai Lama. His conclusions, however seem to be a bit over-analyzed. This is not to say that passages that discuss His Holiness are not inspiring and thought-provoking. They are indeed; and it is those instances that kept me reading. Many have criticized this book, claiming it to be more the words of Cutler, than of the Dalai Lama. To a small extent, I agree, however Cutler certainly has the right to apply His Holiness' wisdom in whatsoever way he sees fit (an act I applaud him for.) Sadly, I found the sections of his book that were more about his own practice to be the least useful."
1,Response to readers put off by Dr. Cutler,"As a practicing Buddhist, I wanted to let others know that part of the tradition of the Buddhist scriptures was to write goshos (letters) in the form of a Q&A, generally between a non-believer and an enlightened one. So Dr. Cutler is following along a well-traveled path by playing 'Devil's advocate' so to speak, and I am sure that the Dalai Lama completely understood that. Buddhism believes in a healthy skepticism on the part of believers because it safeguards against losing one's sense of autonomy to a religious authority. I feel every religion can learn a great deal about themselves and others by studying Budddhist thought. Regardless of the 'vehicle' that you drive, we are all headed for the same destination ultimately!"
2,Mostly just empty talk,"This book is not written by the Dalai Lama, but more like a series of interviews, which really cast some doubt on how much of what is in the book is really from the high priest.That aside, the book is full of empty talk. Sure, a few gems here and there will make you feel good, but after reading the individual chapters, you are likely to walk away with a sense of emptiness. You could use your imaginations to practice what's preached here, but ultimately, if you are looking for a concrete self-help guide, this is not it."
3,It's not as bad as all that,"It is true that this book is a little misleading. When I bought it I thought that it was writtem by the Lama and this Cutler person was his translator or something. Indeed not.Cutler can be heavy-handed at times, true, but a great deal of this book is the Dalai Lama's own words. Cutler just spends a lot of time trying to get it to fit into his own weird pop-psychology way of thinking. Thus, the book is interesting, but not as great as it could be.Read the book if you're interested in the concept. But if you want to read the Dalai Lama's own words and nothing else, pick up another of his books. I think he has at least one that's all him.Oh, and if I were you, I would run away from the new book, The Art of Happiness at Work. Cutler is fast turning the Dalai Lama into the chicken soup for the soul of Buddhism.(and to the crazy christian weirdo... get a life, hun)"
2,Dalai Lama better off without co-author.,"This book has an appealing title and author. It does not deliver content. The co-author Howard Cutler stumbles through endless interpretation of the Lama's ideas. It seems as if Cutler is trying to filter eastern philosophy through a western filter while oversimplifying for the reader. It is unclear if Cutler is ""dumbing down"" his analysis for the simple-minded reader or possibly just is not good at writing. The book would be far better without his aggravating interjections.""Ethics for a New Millenium"" is a much better choice if your looking for a book by the Dalai Lama."
3,book,I have always found the Dali Lama interesting. The book is a guide to helping you find the best in life for yourself. I am reading it slowly. It's alot to absorb.
1,Pass on this book if you're still capable of thinking,"1. This book isn't the Dalai Lama's writing.2. This book is a clever way of ""earning"" some money based on the Dalai Lama's cult of personality.3. The simplistic nonsense passing for deep thoughts can be discounted by anyone who knows anything about logic, history, religion, or is above the age of ten.4. The Dalai Lama is just another in a line of theocrats and would-be theocrats who have polluted the Earth for too many centuries.5. You should learn what Tibet was like under the religious dictatorship of the previous Lamas before making any positive comments about them or their philosophy.6. None of the above points are intended to excuse the horrific crimes that the Chinese government has committed in Tibet."
1,"Blah, blah","The Dalai Lama spouts some clichés about his outlook on life with no new insights. I had to read it for a class. The only good parts I found were ""copied"" from Norman Vincent Peale's THE POWER OF POSITIVE THINKING written decades before and with a Christian perspective."
3,FACT: Teachings in New Testament have Buddhist roots,"The book is ok .... I disagree with the retarded Christian from FL. It doesn't take a degree in rocket science to note that the Old Testament and the New Testament are of a completely different flavor. The Old Testament is full of fire and brimstone, an eye-for-an-eye kind of stuff whereas the New Testament has a distinctly Buddhist slant. Gee, I wonder if the fact that Jesus Christ spent several years in Tibet studying with the Buddhist monks had an influence on his teachings?!?!..."
3,"The Dalai Lama is Great, but......",I have to agree with one of the previous reviewers. I enjoyed the Dalai Lama's excellent commentary on how to live ones life and the general introductions into the buddist faith. But the narration from Cutler is at least 2 to 1 as much as actual hearing from the Dalai Lama. Cutler gives too many examples that are so basic as to be insulting to the average reader. I also found myself skipping his analysis and going straight to the more thought inspiring sections where the Dalai Lama speaks for himself.
5,WOW,"This book was given to my by a friend when i was going through a rough spot in my life. I found the advice easy to follow and it is full of inspiration and power. Most of the content of this book is things that we all should already know, but finding it there in black and white made DOING it so much easier. I covers a wide varitey of topics and anyone who needs help in finding there own inner happiness will learn a great deal. This book was written for everyone, of all faiths and all backgrouds. His holiness speaks of universal love and compassion for ALL who are suffering. This one is for sure one to be added to anyones personal library."
3,It works,"The book I received is what I ordered, but it isn't in as good of shape as I thought it would be. Still works though!"
2,not what I expected,I'm just not a fan of this book. It wasn't actually written by the Dalai Lama and I just don't like the way it reads.
2,Don't be Mislead: Too much Dr Cutler- Too little Daili Lama Content,"This borders on deceit. I bought a book which on the cover appeared to be HH's, the Dali Lama's views on the art of Happiness.What I got was a lot of analysis and comparison from Dr Cutler.How, why, what, what it means, to Dr Cutler...Find a book written by His Holiness instead... and I'm not even a Bhuddist.Sorry Dr Cutler- but you did the wrong thing, packaging the book the way you did."
3,The Art of Grammar,"I was excited to read The Art of Happiness because I love learning about different perspectives on happiness. Although I find the book's principles interesting, I am often too distracted by the continuous grammatical errors to absorb the life lessons. The first sentence of chapter one is grammatically incorrect. I immediately noted that although the sentence ends with a quote, it does not begin with one. Luckily, this does not harm the sentence's content. However, on pages 24 and 25, I noticed that multiple sentences began with quotes, but they did not end with quotes. This is a major problem. Without proper quotation, the text is unreliable. At this point, how can anyone truly confirm the Dalai Lama's thoughts from Howard Cutler's beliefs? The severity of the book's grammatical errors are infringing on the validity of its content. I will continue reading the book, but I feel its poor grammar takes away from the essence of the book as a piece of literature."
1,Disappointed,I was very dissapointed that I spent money on this book. I read all the reviews and was hoping to become enlightened or to find deep hidden wisdom. The material was very elementary. The kind of information you find in a fortune cookie but not as expensive. Save your money.
1,Skip this one!,"It's quite obvious that Dr. Cutler either lacks an understanding of the Dalai Lama's teachings, or is simply using His words to convey Dr. Cutler's own views and concepts.It was frustrating to constantly run into misinterpretations and inappopriate conjectures. I found myself repeatedly re-reading passages while shaking my head and muttering ""no, no, no"" to myself.This is a thinly veiled self-help book, attempting to use the Dalai Lama's name and words to lend credence to simplistic, formulaic bookshelf ""wisdom"".Skip this one!"
5,Excellent!,"This is a fabulous book. I almost didn't buy it because of some of the negative reviews. I read it pieces at a time because there is a lot to mull over. Yes, a lot of the concepts are simple, but they are useful.I've found a lot of food for thought in this book, and being a westerner, I really appreciated the compare/contrast of many of the Dalai Lama's ideas with the western concepts I was brought up with.I highly recommend this book."
5,Not Just For Buddhists,"One of my favorite books of all time (that's saying a lot), I loved this practical, insightful and inspiring look into ourselves. The Dalai Lama discusses happiness and how to truly find it. The book goes far beyond that. Don't expect the usual psychological jargon here, just the simplest of things that we so often overlook...and some things we've always known but never been truly aware of. If you're interested in an idea of what Buddhism is about (practical rather than religious in this book), if you want a more ""natural"" approach to finding your own happiness or if you just want a very fascinating read - this book is for you. I rather enjoyed the dialogue between the Dalai Lama and the writer."
2,"Cutler gets in the way - ""Ethics...."" is a better read","Unfortunately, Cutler keeps getting in the way by explaining things that don't need to be explained. This makes reading the book a laborious test of will. The insights by the Dalai Lama are profound and transcend religious and cultural boundaries, but they require introspection to truly explore the implications of those insights. Cutler doesn't allow the reader to do this, instead he quickly boxes the quote into a clean, often artificial container, diffusing the impact of the original quote.A much better read which offers most of the same message, without the distractions, is ""Ethics for a New Millenium"" by the Dalai Lama."
3,A treatise on happiness,"Always one to be skeptical of these kinds of collaborative book efforts, I think it's important to point out that 'The Art of Happiness' was written not by the Dalai Lama, but by Howard C. Cutler, a psychiatrist. Dr. Cutler weaves together exerpts from numerous conversations with the Dalai Lama spanning many years, and from public talks given throughout Arizona in 1993. The result is an enjoyable treatise on a topic of widespread importance: happiness (or the lack thereof). I also highly recommend ""Open Your Mind, Open Your Life: A Book of Eastern Wisdom"" by Taro Gold, which makes a great companion book to all of the Dalai Lama's works."
1,Un-Happy with deception,"I have been unable to finish reading this book; I came to the Amazon reviews thinking ""is it me?"" and found there are some others who feel as I do.I couldn't read without a troubling thought constantly nagging me. 'Why is this book sold as the Dalai Lama's?' It [appears to be} a fraud - it is prominently Cutler's book.As you read your mind is distracted in figuring out whose words are whose. They are not well indicated by simple things like quotation marks. One can tell, to some degree - the rambling repetitive restatements are Cutler's.Sadly disappointed."
4,"Vain Cutler, Insightful Lama.","I agree with most of the previous reviews that Mr.Cutler lost this battle of wits with the Dalai Lama. The latter shows us in vivid detail how to cope and beat the blues, anger, envy, etc. Mr.Cutlers attempts to outwit DL with psychological questioning was transparent and ineffective. DL's logical responses go far beyond the limits of the self. Part1-The Purpose Of Life, P2-Human Warmth And Compassion, P3-Transforming Suffering, P4-Overcoming Obstacles, and P5-Closing Reflections On Living A Spiritual Life. Will give any reader plenty to reflect on. For me P3 was the linchpin of the book. Page 140 was the most crucial. Attitude truly does play a huge role in our lives, even if we are slow to realize it."
3,Readers are wise to choose other books first.,"The problem I have with this book is that the co-author (Cutler, a psychiatrist from Phoenix) seems ill suited - he poses questions and it sounds like he is surprised by the answers he gets from the Dalai Lama (he is often ""annoyed"" at the answers and even argues at some points). It seems a bit like a blind person trying to interview a Claude Monet or a van Gogh. Cutler also feels the need to augment the Dalai Lama's positions with supportive ""evidence"" from modern Western psychological research - one feels Cutler is saying ""see, OUR research proves he is right."" Also, it can be tricky to see what quotes are from Cutler, and which are from the Dalai Lama. I'd strongly suggest reading Ethics For The New Millennium first - a much better book and I think, more true to the Dalai Lama's voice."
2,Buddhists - Tell me about a good book from the Dalai Lama,"Somewhat interesting but I wasn't looking for a western commentary on the Dalai Lama's insights. I would rather read it directly from his perspective and draw my own conclusions. If you have an excellent perspective of Buddhism, please email me with a book you would recommend for a beginner. I prefer to start with a conceptual type book overviewing philosophies, history, and practices. Thanks in advance for your input.My email: rschurfeld@glasscity.net"
2,NOT A HANDBOOK OF ANYTHING,"IF THERE HAS EVER BEEN A BOOK THAT HAS NOT LIVED UP TO IT'S TITLE , IT IS THIS ONE, THIS IS NOT A HANDBOOK , IT'S AN ORGANIZED GROUP OF IDEAS. THE DALAI LAMA'S PART OF THE BOOK IS GREAT , IT DESERVES 5 STARS , BUT THE REST IS NOT WORTH READING , A BAD INTRO TO BUDDHISM. YOU'LL FIND YOURSELF SKIPPING AROUND TO FIND WHAT THE DALAI LAMA AND ONLY THE DALAI LAMA HAS TO SAY. IF YOU WANT A BOOK THIS IS FINE , IF YOU WANT A CLEAR AND WORTHWHILE BUDDHIST HANDBOOK ,LOOK ELSEWHERE"
5,A refresher course in common sense.,"Good thing I don't rely on the rants of a few readers who gave this book a negative - (VanDusen from Pompano Beach might want to seriously consider an eye exam. It's Howard Cutler, not Harry). In spite of the mixed reviews, this book offers exactly what it says: Happiness is an art and one that needs constant practice. The Dali Lama makes clear that it is not so much an intellectual pursuit as it is the spiritual practice of compassion -- seeing ourselves in another. Dr. Cutler's conversational process allows us to connect more easily with a message that is universally important. Another way to more clearly understand the code of behavior the Dali Lama speaks of is to read ""Ethics for the New Millennium"" and a funny and inspiring ethics twist, ""The Lone Ranger's Code of the West."""
3,"Common sense for some, reality check for some others.","Much of this book is commonsense advice on putting things in perspective, appreciating what we take for granted, and just ""taking it slow""--ordinary checking points to our everyday trifles that we somehow always forget to think about. The Dalai Lama's musings are a nice reminder. As far as actually teaching anything, however, this book is a disappointment. Only the emotionally immature or naive among us who truly believe that extra money in the wallet or a new sportscar will actually result in a permanent rise in their level of content will find this book genuinely informative. (But on the other hand, the number of people who think this way should not be underestimated.) Nevertheless, as I mentioned earlier, for the more grounded among us, it is a gentle, worthwhile reminder of what's important. But for this purpose, simply browsing through it in a store or library accomplishes the same as buying it. Suit yourself."
2,Don't judge a book by its cover!,"2 stars may be a bit harsh--but I was sooooo disappointed. His Holiness the Dalai Lama does not need Howard Cutler as an interpreter -- his ideas are elegant and eloquent -- and can stand beautifully alone in their simplicity. From the cover, I thought the Dalai Lama wrote the lion's share -- but Cutler was entirely too present to satisfy me."
4,Emotional balance...,"It's an informative book in which the Dalai Lama discusses many of his own methods for handling negative emotions. But really, Dr. Howard Cutler is the main author of this book, like a previous reviewer said. Dr. Cutler helps make the ideas more accessible to Western ears, but next time I want a book that actually is written by the Dalai Lama himself. This was an excellent read nevertheless.This is a book on how to be happy, how to control negative emotions, and how to be compassionate. I think some people were confused and thought it was an intro to Buddhism, which it is not."
4,"Very good book, but, it takes a lot of concentration.",I would reccomend this read for anyone interested in becoming a better individual.
2,"A good reminder, nothing I haven't heard before.","I listened to the audio tape rather than reading it, so maybe I missed something. I definitely admire the Dalai Lama and what he stands for, but what the book preaches is pretty logical for any normal human being and served more as a reminder rather than new insight. Compassion and happiness...easier said than done, at least in our society today. I wish he would've explained more how he came to what he is...why and how he doesn't crave what he doesn't have, or get angry when wrong has hit him. It seemed like he was basically preaching to the choir. Anyone who would read his book would hope to get more out of what he gave. What he said was logical and nothing I haven't heard before. The meditations were pretty cool, and I wish he wouldn't gotten more into them. It seemed a little repetetive, but it was a good reminder of how we should all be living our lives. Although I could go hang out with my parent's for a couple of hours for this reminder."
4,Defender Next Generation,I remember the original game in the arcade (at which I was never very good) and the Atari 800 version (at which I was pretty good.) Overall this is a good game. Decent graphics. I like that it incorporates much of the original game's sound effects. A better point of view during game play would be appreciated.
1,Not the game I thought it was.,I thought from the descriptionbit was a plug and play. I'm not too current on the game systems out there. So buying this was a mistake. What I need is return information so I can get a refund. The game is still unopened. Thank u.
3,Ifound what I was looking for...,I was looking for a polish for my ring. This works for silver jewlery but I'm not sure that I would ever use it on my wedding ring.
3,Outdated materials,The materials are clearly out-of-date. It was published in 1997. It is already three years ago. Lots of changes have been made for AICPA rules and materials.
5,Another Mae Moore Impeccable Musical And Vocal Gem !,"Mae Moore is Canada's hidden musical treasure. All eleven songs on this CD are captivating, compelling and perfectly executed by a wonderful lyricist and singer. Mae Moore has an eclectic voice that can be husky, tender, uplifting, mournful and it can beautifully sigh like a forsaken angel. Her guitar work is also amazing. All of Mae Moore's albums are absolutely worth purchasing. She also happens to be a great person who loves peace, protecting the environment, organic farming and ethical vegetarianism. If you have never heard of Mae Moore, it is imperative to buy her ""Collected Works 1989-1999"", which will seduce you to obtain all of her recordings."
3,Average about sums it up,"The trite songs in this musical slow down what may have been a passable, if pedestrian, straight comedy. The songs and musical numbers save one are the height of mediocrity. A burlesque queen (Virginia Mayo) quits show biz to enter college and one of her professors (Ronald Reagan) helps hide her past. But when a malicious and jealous student (Patrice Wymore) finds out, she blackmails her. This film has some of the oldest college students I've ever seen including Gene Nelson who has the film's best number, an athletic dance number in a gym. Poor Reagan has an endless (it runs about 20 minutes) drunk scene and it's one of the worst acted drunk scenes I've ever seen, I just cringed for the poor guy. Phyllis Thaxter as Reagan's wife and Don DeFore as her ex-boyfriend co-star.The Warners Archives DVD is a vivid transfer in its appropriate 1.33 aspect ratio."
3,"Fun for the bath and pool, but no color change","My daughter received this toy as a gift on her second birthday. Overall, it is a good toy for her to play with, but the lifejacket and Boots' innertube do not change color. I do like the fact that Dora is wearing a lifejacket, which makes it easy to convince my daughter to wear one. My daughter does seem to play more with Boots than Dora, probably because he squirts water. The toy is easy to clean(my daughter plays with it in an outdoor pool, and it sometimes ends up out of the water and on the ground). It has held up very well considering it is at the mercy of a two-year old. It's a good toy, but I wish it would change colors like the packaging stated."
2,Cute but not functional,"We bought this Dora and Boots set at Walmart for $8 Dec 2005. It's so cute but not very functional. We assumed this was a bath toy and that's exactly what my 2 year old thought too. Dora's head fills up with water and after fighting to get her head off to empty it, we found that there was no hole to empty the water out of....how water gets in it is beyond me! She is top heavy to begin with but once water gets in it's hard to get her to stand up on her own. And her head dented from what we believe is the water pressure that has built up in there. Boots is also head-heavy so he usually ends upside-down in the water. His innertube is a squirter which is fun but it fills up and makes him unable to float like he should. My daughter loved playing with them for maybe 3 days. Now they just float around unnoticed in the bath."
2,doesn't do much,I didn't like this toy at all. It didn't do anything. I was thinking that it ought to have a wind up that would allow Dora to kick her legs up and down to simulate a swimming movement.
5,bathtub fun,All kids like bathtub toys. This one holds up really well. One granddaughter had one and the other wanted one for Christmas. The twins in the swim ring will hold water and are hard to drain.
2,water water everywhere,"My 2 1/2 yr old daughter is a huge Dora fan. This was a gift given to us. She pretty muched ditched all her other bath toys to play with Dora. Dora's head is Full of water. After using all my strength to remove her head to drain the water, I noticed mold around the inside. I can't figure out how the water gets in, nor you can't get it out. This should not be sold as a bath toy. It's a bacteria wasteland is what it is. As other people have mentioned, she is top heavy standing is an issue, boots doesn't exactly ""float"" either. It's all around a pourly made toy. I wouldn't waste your money."
4,Cute but water will leak in,"My daughter received this toy for her 2nd b-day. She loves Dora and loved this toy. However, there is a flaw and if I wasn't so lazy I would write the manufacturer. This toy leaks. Water immediately gets into Dora's head and because it is pretty well sealed (I'm sure to avoid this) the water does not come out. We've seen this before w/ bath toys and know that mold will grow quickly inside. We will have to throw this toy away - too bad. Perhaps this was only the one received? But I doubt it."
2,waste of money for me.,"my daughter recvd this for her birthday thinking she would love to play with this in the bathtub but she hardly even touches it!she plays with other bath toys over these. the only thing she likes to do to dora sometimes is put makeup on her face with her water crayons which wash right off, and don't even mention boots he is just nasty, nothing but nasty slimy mold growing inside i threw him away along time ago and my daughter still hasn't noticed! I try to get her to play with the dora at the pool but she just isn't having it, I'm surprised because she loves dora,but this just doesn't do it for her."
1,Pointless,"This is my second online review of a product on Amazon. I hate this toy. It was given to my kid as a Christmas present. My kid likes it fine. But it doesn't do ANYTHING!!! Dora's head and arms move, but that is it. Dora floats in the water face down motionless most of the time; frankly, when Dora is in the water, she reminds me of a corpse. The least they could have done is designed Dora so she would float upright. Boots, at least, floats right-side up."
4,Can't get the water out,My 3 1/2 year old daughter loves the Dora and Boots. She playswith them at every bathtime. I like the life jacket because welive on a lake and it reinforces our rule about wearing a lifejacket when we go on the pier.Boots seems to be top heavy and doesn't float perfectly but always at an angle.Even if you let water get in him he doesn't straighten up.Dora has some how gotten water in her andI can not figure out how to get it out. That said we lovethe bathtime toys!
