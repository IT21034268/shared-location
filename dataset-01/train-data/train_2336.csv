5,cowboy hats,"I thought that the book was a book on making cowboy hats. It was not, it is a history of hats. It is a nice book, just not what I had thought it was."
1,Jr. High Bad,"After 30 years of avid reading, this will be the first book I return for content. It's that bad. The plot is dumb, the characters are immature, and story is choppy (like whole sections were edited out). The heroine and her sisters are spoiled brats, and the dialogue attempts to be fun and cutsie (it's not).Prime example of why the Bombshell line is being discontinued."
3,Perfect for small applications,The hedger works great on small branches but do not try it on the larger ones. I really like not having to try to pull start or pull a cord around so this hedger is for me.
5,great machine,I love the cordless feature and the fact that it is battery operated makes it even better. It is a bit heavier than I'd like but I am very pleased with it.
4,Worx cordless electric hedge trimmer,"Overall, my husband likes the hedge trimmer. He just wishes he did not have to press both ""on"" buttons at the same time in order to be able to extend his arm farther over the object being trimmed. Only taking an hour for charging purposes is a plus. He is considering getting another battery to extend the working period."
2,It has Problems,"I bought this for my husband and he's complaining the battery doesn't last very long...like 30 minutes at the most, even after being charged overnight!"
1,Waste of money,"I have numerous yard and farm implements, and consider this the worst of anything I've ever purchased. I was not able to use this product until it was too late to return - I would definitely have returned this trimmer had I been able to.Even after being charged over night this trimmer did not have the power to trim a shrub with no leaves and the branches the size of a pencil or less. Even with little resistance the implement sounds sluggish, with low power.This is a total waste of money."
3,chronology demands,"Classics' date-by-recording-date approach is certainly most scholarly. The Goodman outfit(s) cut some nice sides and some throwaways too. Charlie Christian is on several tracks that are also the high points of this CD. Important for completists. And, unless one is into alternative tracks collections of Charlie Christian's work, continues to collect the master takes in the order in which they were made. and that's good already."
2,Not what was expected,Please note that the soundtracs are not the original tracks of the TV series but performed by London Theater Orchestra something not advertised when buing this cd on line
3,"Good writing, bad printing","Pros: This book explains things very clearly, and with good diagrams.Cons: A lot of the pages have this weird printing glitch in which the page is printed twice on a single sheet, offset by about the height of a line of text. So instead of whitespace in between each line, there is a second copy of that line, in slightly lighter ink, and sometimes with the two prints overlapping. Very hard to read. Formulas are nearly impossible to read. This happens on about 8 of the pages I've come across so far (halfway thru the book)."
2,"Too much filler, too little content","I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone who already owns an introductory physics text such as Halliday and Resnick or the Feynman Lectures...the quantity of material beyond the scope of those books is very disappointing. The authors seem more interested in pretty pictures and impressive graphs than content. The only chapter I found useful was the chapter on nuclear physics. If you can find this book used for a bargain, it might be worth the money, but at the full price, purchase at your own risk."
4,If you want a good base understanding...,"This textbook was used in the modern physics class I took during college. It is excellent because it doesn't just derive the fundamental equations and move on leaving the student to find their significance elsewhere. There is just as much text as mathematical steps to ensure the student has a good understanding. The problems are tough, but really well worded."
3,Good book for the non-scientist,"This book is good if you want to know the general concepts of modern physics without going through all of the work to get there. Results are presented, but the way in which they are reached is far from rigorous. Also, the exercises in the book are entirely unchallenging. While this book is good for the layman, if you want to actually understand modern physics look elsewhere."
3,Great bag - Large is too Large,"I love my bag (size small) I have had it for a year. Its great in rain and easy to carry.I always felt the size was just a little small. Its okay for ipad and other stuff but always had a hard time putting in a laptop in it, even the 14""So after a year of use and to a point of outgrowing it, I ordered the same in large size.Well the Large is so large that it can eat two of the small ones. Its big enough to carry large portfolios. I am not sure what I am going to do. May be return it. Its just to big for regular use for me.I think Sealline drop the ball on the sizes, small could be a little bigger or at least have a medium size as Large is humungous.I like sealline I wish they made this in a medium size. I will continue using the small."
4,Very reasonable price,"I purchased this as a wedding gift. It arrived quickly and well packaged. It is reasonably large, but not too large or heavy - just right for a serving bowl. The pattern is quite versatile as well - can go from casual to formal dining."
3,Not as good as I'd hoped,"This book is a futuristic romance full of really hot guys. But it just seemed like some of the plot was not developed enough. I don't want to get into too many details for those who want to read it, but I can say that there didn't seem to be enough development of our hunk's devastating past, or our lovely heroine's link to the future through her parents. The book ended too abruptly for my taste. If you want to check it out, get it used."
1,Horrible,"I can't believe I bought this book. It was a horrible waste of time. I got so angry at the author reading his extremely poor English, his vagueness and true inexperience with running a web hosting business it makes me want to sit down and write my own!I still can't believe I ordered this and read through most of it. I want my money back."
1,Worthless!,Do not spend your money on this book. It is vague and provides no real information. There is absolutely no technical information that is worthwhile in this book. Very poorly written. This is an example of why I hesitate in buying anything online. This book got 1 star because Amazon required something.
1,Terrible,"The book is very poorly written, has very basic information, and not much to it except for misspelled words and bad grammer.These 5 star reviews have to be his friends. I bought this book and was so frustrated reading it because I felt like I was taking advise from a 6th grader.The author says he only ran a hosting company for about a year and then got frustrated and quit.Not sure why Amazon keeps this self-published 100 page pamphlet on their website."
3,Inspiring How To for Future Web Hosters,"I liked this book because it is written from a real life perspective from someone who started from the ground up and made his dream work. While it's not really a technical ""how-to"" manual (for that you should get The Complete Web Hosting Kit Professional that has all the ""how to"" as well as all the software you need to set up a web server, an e-mail server, and go into business for yourself hosting other people's web sites) it does what few books do: inspires! I like to come away from a book feeling like ""I can do that!"", and that's the feeling I had after finishing the Web Hosting Manual."
3,Geared more towards taking existing business to next level,"I did not find that this book was helpful for getting started with a food business. Lots of people start by selling small to local stores, at craft fairs, mall kiosks, etc. This book was more geared to starting big - that means a big investment and is better suited to someone who already has a decent small business going. For them, this book would be helpful."
5,Excellent Guide For Speciality Food Startups,"After reading dozens of obtuse marketing studies on the speciality food business, I came across this book. What a delight! All the basic information an entrepenuer needs in one place. The author generously shares practical, authorative advice and guidance through very clear writing and diagrams. It's to-the-point and easy-to-read. The book is also well-organized, has a nice clean layout, and has great resource listings in back of book. Too good to be true? So far, it's been very helpful to me! Highly Recommended."
4,Learn the market for small food-based companies.,"This book covers every entree into the business from expanding an existing food manufacturing business into retail packaging, to starting a ""sideline"" business with your ""famous"" honey and pecan mustard."
2,Missing the Obvious,"My biggest questions are: What are the laws about the sale of food from the kitchen? Is a health inspection of the kitchen necessary? Where would I find this information for the state in which I live?This book does not cover any of the information that I think is necessary. I enjoy preparing food and giving it away in pretty containers. I was hoping I could sell some of my gorgeous and delicious gifts with little overhead. According to the author, one should plan on laying out a rather large investment for this type of business.FROM KITCHEN TO MARKET contains many details but omits the basic information required to get started."
4,"Well written, great guidlines but not right for everyone.","This is a good book, but not exactly what I was expecting. As a Small Business Consultant, I was asked to teach a class on marketing your food product for a local food incubator, which is beginning level. This is great if you want to have your mustard in a national chain, your tea or coffee on grocery store shelves, or the like. What I thought it would help with was entry level marketing to get your food into local stores, selling on the internet, and getting into a trade show. It did give guidance to higher levels of the same thing, and was very professionally done, just a bit above what I was expecting. If you already have an established product and do large scale production, this is a great book for you. For beginners, it doesn't really take it right out of the kitchen...its sort of a couple notches past that.Excellent author and wonderful expertise though. Definitely a keeper for my personal library."
2,Didn't answer my questions,"I was looking for help getting my product sold locally, and this was no help. After all the money I have spent trying to get my product sold, I wish I had the money I spent on this book back."
3,"As described, but doesn't fit CA license plate well.","This item was fine, it came as described. My only issue with it is that the design is such that it covers part of the numbers on our CA plate, which is illegal here in CA for the back plate -- so we had to put it in the front where not many people see it. I think they needed to design it so the graphics don't block the numbers. CA does have larger numbers than... say... our SD plates did. I don't know what Florida plates may look like. All states have plates that are a standard size, so it fits onto the truck and over the plate fine, but some states numbers extend almost all the way to the edge of the plate (like in CA), and if your state's plate do then expect the graphics to cover part of the plate number."
5,SUPERB EVERYTHING!!!,"This was an excellent product, and makes a great gift!!! It arrives promptly, and the picture on the internet doesn't do it justice! I love it, and Team Fantastics is definitely a seller that reliable, and has great products! I would no questions order from them again!!!"
1,Would have given zero if I could have....,"This has to be the absolute worst Christmas CD I have ever listened to. Though the description says its ""various artists"", it suspiciously sounds like one guy, playing his casio keyboard in his living room, recorded with his Fisher Price tape recorder. Every song sounds the same - same beat, same tempo. If the number on my cd player hadn't changed, I wouldn't have known the song had changed. One other thing - each song is only about a minute long, which, actually, may be a good thing. This is one listener who is not hooked."
1,I whole heartedly agree with lenscrafty,"This CD was such a JIP! I, too, would have given this CD ZERO stars. Everything lenscrafty said was dead on. I was so excited when I found this because it seemed like such a great album. God, was I wrong. I couldn't wait to get home to listen to it, but when I did and put it in my CD player, my mouth dropped. I was like, ""You have GOT to be kidding me."" It is so pathetic. Don't waste your money on it. In fact, the guy who made the CD should give everyone their money back and some kind of compensation (like some therapy sessions) for putting us through the horror of having to listen to even 10 seconds of that. I think I'm scarred for life. . ."
5,Not Just Another Pretty Jazz Album,"This cd is simply amazing. I bought it while I was in Nashville after a music teacher at MTSU suggested that I listen to it. With all due respect to the New York jazz scene, this album is such a breath of fresh air in comparison to most modern jazz. The Nashville delivery and the stripped down quartet setup (the jazz quartet is almost a lost art) make this an incredible blend of the old and the new. If you have any interest at all in vocal jazz, this is above and away one of the top ten jazz albums of the ninties. Great job, JIM."
1,Incredibly poor quality,"Part of the scoring sequence on the board reads, ""80, 85, sideways S, 95, 110, 105, 110, 115, 120."" The board halves don't line up when folded and the hinge is weak. The paint is smeared. The directions are copied from a website that the manufacturer doesn't own. The cards are of very poor quality. But, it is the cheapest board available. I shouldn't have to, but I will live with these defects because it is cheaper than the other boards. I expect more quality for my money, even when it's only $10."
2,Poor quality,"I agree with Richard Topliff's review...and add that the hinge is not recessed when the board is open so the metal rubs on your table--we're forced to put a cloth underneath to protect our wood.We needed a board quickly and this was all we could find after visiting four local stores, so we'll keep it for travel, but for daily use...I don't think so!"
1,Don't waste your money on this cheaply made board!,"I recently purchased this Cribbage Board from a local department store and was very disappointed with its quality. Since it folds in half, it has a hinge that wasn't installed very well so when it lays flat, it's not very flat. Also the holes are drilled really bad and the plastic pegs don't stick in the holes very well. I suggest looking for a better made cribbage board with metal pegs! I'll be returning this pos when I come across a nicer one!"
1,NOT as pictured - VERY disappointed,"My husband and I already had the product that is pictured - a nice metal container with a decent set of cards. However, what we received from Amazon was an extremely cheap cardboard container which doesn't look like it will even hold up to the scuffing it will take to get it out of the plastic wrap. I purposely ordered this on Amazon (instead of purchasing the cardboard version for less at Walmart) because we specifically wanted the durable metal container as a fun gift for our son-in-law's birthday. This looks very cheap, and we are considering returning it. I am extremely disappointed that Amazon has not changed their picture to reflect the change in product. This seems like false advertising."
3,13 stars,For the fun of this toy I would give it 3 stars. I don't like hard you have to think before you make your move.IT DEFINATLY HAS A LOT OF EDUCATION( 5 Stars)! Stradegy is a part of life. I would give this toy 5 stars for durability. 3+5+5= 13 stars!
5,Cribbage a game that stands the test of time.,"Although the game looks simple, which it is.There is much strategy involved as well as luck.Beginners can quickly grasp the game and even winagainst cribbage veterans. It is a good game for 8 onup. It teaches kids to be fast thinkers and helpsthem with there adding. You can easily play a gamein 20 minutes. It can be addicting so beware.Great game for the highly competitive."
4,great for wrestling enthusiasts,"Got this for my son for Xmas and he loves it. He set it up himself and he is 9. I thought it would make more interactive sounds, but I guess its okay cause I'm not the one playing with it."
5,Essential reading!,"This fascinating book should be essential reading for anyone interested in social psychology or human nature more generally. If you are a psychologist, sociologist, anthropologist or psychiatrist, this book may profoundly affect how you see your field."
5,Wow!!,"This DVD is arguably the best live metal DVD ever. It captures Superjoint doing what they do best- putting the best and most brutal show you'll ever see. The picture quality is superb and the sound is nothing short of fantastic. Another thing is the environment of the concert, truly deserving the ""underground"" label. Too bad Pantera never released something like this. Go buy this now and thrash along!!"
5,BRUTAL,"I really liked this dvd, totally honest. If you own the Superjoint cd and like it, You will dig this! The 2 videos are fun in a underground sort a way. Support Heavy Metal!!!"
4,Memories,I had one of the songs off this CD stuck in my head for weeks. I finally got my song fix and it was great!
5,It's a Beautiful Day CD,I had been trying to locate this CD for years!I am very happy with the product!
2,"It's All About ""White Bird""","By now, thiry-five years later, I think my nostalgia for the song ""White Bird"" probably puts me out of the running for any objective assessment of its musical merits. It is kind of hippie-schlocky, no doubt. But I never get tired of it. You've got to love that first 30 seconds or so, the intro, with that delicious anticipation of the first utterance of ""White bird..."" And the song just wouldn't work somehow if the singers had a seamless blend to their voices, if they were matched on the order of, say, Simon and Garfunkel. It just wouldn't be ""White Bird."" The rest of the album is forgetable. If you've ever heard the actual Strawberry Alarm Clock album with ""Incense and Peppermints,"" it's the same thing (well, much worse actually, to give due credit to It's a Beautiful Day). Just abominable. Ah, but the one song... a classic. I know there are devoted IABD fans out there, but let's face it, they're a one-hit wonder. But for my vote, the one hit really is a wonder."
3,One Hit Wonder?,"""White Bird"" is one of the greatest songs ever recorded, but the rest of this album is very mediocre. However, it may be worth picking up, just for the classic ""Whie Bird"". The remainder of the CD is very flat and sounds very dated."
3,I owned this...,TRC went out of business and CBS/Columbia/SONY put it out in 2000; (in Europe-as they had originally on LP)The new disc had a noticably brighter sound-it had been remastered
5,laflamme beautiful day a model,"the first time i heard It's a Beautiful Day, in 1970, i was ayoung garage musician. Led Zep, Hendrix, Grand Funk, C.C.R. my heroes, It's a Beautiful Day oh! violin, Robert Goulet voice, but something i had never heard before :prog\folk\sound.WoW!Child in time by Deep Purple is great, but when i listen Bombay Calling i'm proud to be a IABD FAN.Fantastik,GENIUS,SUBLIMO,Innovating like Mag. Myst. Tour. and Mahavishnu Orch."
5,A classic,"Anyone who pays attention to Mike McGonigal's ""review"" should first consider Zappa's statement about rock journalists. It's certainly true that, given that some people think Grand Funk is great music, musical tastes are individual things, but as It's a Beautiful Day, along with the other San Francisco bands of the 60's, were inventing the very things McGonigal chastizes them for using, this review is sadly uninformed by any notions of the history of the music. There are very few superb albums. This is one of them."
4,Musicianship,Amazon's deplorable review for this album should be taken down immediately and replaced by something intelligent. Ignoring the extraordinary musicianship of the group COMPLETELY in favor of a whiny knock-down of lyrical naivete bespeaks a closed mind and a tin ear.
1,Uneven San Francisco sound,I bought this album about five years ago and was very disappointed. I remember hearing White Bird on the radio years ago and was expecting something as good from the other cuts. The current prices ($99.89 and up) are a rip-off! If you really want the album buy the MP3 version.
4,Very Interesting,"I remember the first time when i purchased my copy. i was stationed in Germany, at that time the album was banned in th U.S. The cover was even stamped, banned for import in to the United States. It brings a lot of memories back of the 60's era. Also did you know that the album was produced by a Retired LT. Col. from the U.S. Air Force"
5,Essential addition to any collection,"If you are one who came of age in the 60's or appreciates the music of the period, this CD is a must! Released in 1969, this San Francisco based group produced an album that captured the ""sound of the bay area"" in its' waning years. Your music collection is incomplete without this CD."
3,"Two Great Cuts, One Nostalgic Cut, and a Lot of Garbage","Great cut: Hot Summer Day: unique, superb mix of instruments (violin, harmonica, keyboard, and electric guitar), nice vocals (the lyrics are kinda dumb, but that's part of the 60s), fantastic build up...everything that characterizes a great 60s song. The last few intensive notes end this song beautifully.Great cut: Bombay Calling - a wonderful violin driven instrumental that makes you bounce in your seat.Nostalgic Cut: White Bird (yup. I'm that old). Great to hear it, but it makes its point and then pounds you to death with itOK Cut: Girl with No Eyes (what is this song trying to tell us?)What's with the rest of this junk? It's either painfully harsh or just downright boring. Amazon reviewer Mike McGonigal hit the nail on the head. This album is everything that's right and wrong with the 60s music."
1,S.F. Sound Ripped off It's A Beautiful Day for over 30years,"Please give all the money back that you stole from It's A Beautiful day, Mathew Katz"
2,cd skips right out of package,"CD skipped very bad from 1st listening, and several songs not just one. After several plays of cd the skipping lessened, but still has a few spots that still skip."
3,Back When My Hair Was Short...,"...It's A Beautiful Day was the warmup band for...Neil Diamond on tour...in Iowa! As Casey Stengel would say, ""Ya can look it up.""Anyway, IABD was the zenith of psychedelic schlock what with David LaFlamme's fire red electric violin and the not-so-subtle sex-charged duets he did with Patti Santos.I've heard ""White Bird"" more times than I care to recall and, by now, actually prefer ""Hot Summer Day"" for its mellow, easy sound.If you are trying to warn your kids about the dangers of drugs, this disc is a good place to start.Doc Rock"
1,"Not, by far, the best period piece from this fertile period.","Dated garbage. Utter, total, dated garbage. The groaning, moaning ""White Bird"" isn't sufficient to redeem this period piece. Iron Butterfly, never a darling of the critics, is a better listen. Get their ""greatest hits"" instead of this if you want to revisit the late 1960s."
5,a 'perfect' album,"When radio stations employ the technique of letting their listeners call in with 5 or 10 songs that would make THE PERFECT ALBUM ... they should just listen to this. It's a Beautiful Day is one of those groups that has, on their first attempt, created a masterpiece! I spent many hours enjoying this and it's as good today as it was 30 years ago. This just proves that art spans the generations."
5,One of the most beautiful albums in Rock history is being injured,"It's A Beautiful Day (self-titled): Not only is this the most beautiful album to come out of the 1960's San Francisco Scene, this is one of the most beautiful albums in Rock history. This is as emotionally stirring an album as your ever likely to find. The lyrics, the harmonies, the band's orchestration are all magnificent. You should not be without this album. This one deserves a Sixth Star, it is that special.One warning: as great as this album is, there are some very poor CD versions out right now (as of 2011) and you might have to wait for a better release. I have the old TRC import CD which is fine for now but it certainly is being over-priced as a used CD. There is just no excuse for the disrespect this album is getting. Whoever owns the rights to this album needs to either release a decent remastered CD or they need to sell the rights to a proper company."
2,roll away,"although the concept is great, the keys are a bit stiff to play so you loose out on a lot of the keys your trying to play."
1,Too tough for young kids!,"I bought this game for my daughters, ages 8 and 9, who know next to nothing about U.S. geography, hoping they'd learn some of the basics. The questions in this game are WAY too difficult for geography beginners in terms of the content, and the convoluted way the questions are phrased makes it taxing just to listen and get the gist of the question. The game might be educational, but if it's no fun for young players, they are not going to play it and learn anything."
5,Best game!,I love this game it is challenging but if it is to easy you can make it harder. Directions are bad but the game itself makes up for it. Recomended big time
1,Too Small,I ordered a size large I wear a size 10 and this was way too small for me. It fit more like a size 6/8
5,Concise and useable,"I bought my 'new', used ibook on ebay and so have no manual. The guy was nice enough to send it with Jaguar installed though, so I popped over to amazon, and bought this little guide. I am up and running, with an updated ISP, browser (safari, free at apple), and cooking along with icons making sense and configurations configured, ALL because of this little book! Now I know I have to get one of those big heavy books for the Big Stuff, but I am good to go in the meantime."
1,Not what I expected,"I am not happy with the purchase. I intended to use it on top of the stove over the burner. The picture of it makes it appear as if it is one piece of metal, but there are gaping spaces between each roller so the juices will run out and hit the flames. If I'm cooking on the grill I'd rather cook the old fashion way with the hot dog on the grill and getting slightly burned. I don't know of anyone who would ""grill"" a hot dog on their grill in this manner. I wound up throwing this ""gadget"" out."
3,BIG DEAL IN SMALL PACKAGE,WHAT A QUICK TOOL FOR THE SPAIN TRAVELER. I AGREE WITH THE FIRST REVIEWER. SHORT AND SWEET !
5,A Stereo Photographer,"This is one of the best books on stereo photography (3D pictures) although all stereo photography books are good, if you can find them. This book covers the Realist camera and related photography products in detail. The realist 35 mm film camera (although 50 years old) is still a top stereo camera, and this is a great book that tells you all about the camera and stereo photography. If you are interested in 3D photography the Realist camera ($100.00 on ebay) and this book are the ones to get. We all will be going digital in the future, but this is a cost effective (35mm film) way to get into 3D."
3,Fighting Kung Fu,This DVD shows your basic fighting techniques. No english just a narrator speaking over the teachers voice. It also has different drills that you can use for yourself.
3,Jac toothbrush,I really liked it and do did my daughter but it stopped working about a week after we got it and there is no way to change batteries so I guess we are just out of luck
5,THE GREATEST HITS!!,"As a lifelong Whitney fan, I LOVE this representation of her work! This is much better than the double CD that was released (although I LOVE her with George Michael on If I Told You That). I'm still watching the DVD so I haven't gotten through it entirely however, I need to give compliments for the concert version of Didn't We Almost Have It All. PHENOMENAL performance! Whitney gave her all on that stage! Although I was a fan, I was too young to really attend her performances then so I definitely appreciate the art of film making. The filming and recording is fabulous! If you are a lover of vocals, wonderful writing of lyrics we won't EVER get again in this lifetime (i.e. Diane Warren and all the fabulous others), music that fills you inside when you play it loud enough, and the wonderful talent that came through Whitney, YOU WILL WANT THIS DVD. RIP Whitney Nip Houston! I will definitely always love you!"
1,No Rating-No music on CD,"i ordered this cd 3 times and 3 times it had no music on it. Amazon has not said what the problem was,I was very disappointed because I really want Whitney's cd."
3,"Disc 1 fantastic, disc 2 ruined by canned disco beat.","I guess when I ordered this cd set I only paid attention to the list of songs and was sold. After receiving and listening to them, disc 1 was wonderful. Then I listened to disc 2 and couldn't believe my ears. Song after song, with the exception of the last 2 tracks, One Moment in Time and The Star Spangled Banner ( thank God they had the decency to not ruin that !! ) , had this annoying, canned sounding disco beat getting in the way of that incredible voice. I never would have purchased this set had I known. Who would think that would make those songs better ? I still can't believe it!!"
3,What to order?,I just recieved this 2 CD set and I really enjoy it BUT I wanted the original recordgings! The first CD with the slow recording are great but the second with the upbeat recordings I (of course) love Whitney's voice but I am not into the disco sound. Can someone please recommend which CD or CD's to order to get all the originals? Thanks!
1,Damaged,I had to return it because the first song kept playing the begging few words over and over. I would not recommend buying from this dealer.
4,Only 4 stars cuz I didn't go through w/ to buy this one.,"Whitney's great, and this DVD has really good reviews. If you want a Whitney DVD, this one's good."
1,I FORGOT HOW BAD VIDEOS WHITNEY MADE!,"Whitney has a great voice, but when it comes to music videos, she should get some advice from Paula Abdul(genious video maker), her videos simply sux."
4,It's the Bomb !!!!,"Yeah, Whitney for real in her prime. Whitney displays all her vocal ability in this DVD.I would recommend this DVD to anyone who is into Whitney.She is a real top performer on any given day and her range of vocal ability makes her standout from so many other performers from the 1990's."
4,whitney houston- greatest hits,"very well put together dvd music vidoes. but they were a couple of song she or they leave out. they are ""one moment in time and hold me"" overall it was a good music videosjd"
5,Great Service!,Product was received and I was very happy that it was as described (new) and I received in a timely manner. Ordered it from amazon. Great dvd I would highly recommend it!
5,it WORX,"nice trimmer,good power,well built.had no problem cutting all my hedgesthe only con: the slide handle makes no cense"
1,Outdated product,I tried this internet security software along with its other iterations and found this product to also be outdated. I so much wanted to have a product that does what it promised that I gave other versions of it a try. This one got the same result. As with the other versions the product is no longer supported. As such it does not work with many browsers and I tried just about all of them in an effort to see if I can work around the problem. I also noticed that this version also caused my computer to crash often. This product went to the trash like the other versions. I guess I will have to keep looking for another software that will do what this product promised.
1,outdated product,"I ordered computer software from Jimmy's For Less. The package came in a timely manner, but the software was a year old and already outdated. I sent an e-mail to Jimmy's to get a resolution, but no response."
1,This sucks!,"All I can say is when I installed it, my computer crashed frequently till I uninstalled it. now it's just sitting on my shelf collecting dust!"
3,Great exept for one flaw,"as far as guns go for the price its Great with one exeption: fast, easy for beginers, Great acuracy ,holds about 40 bb'sTheirs a major flaw its about as durable as a glass cup. you have to be very very very careful with it and whatever you do Don't overcock it because you'll have to take the gun apart to get the bbs out if you do."
1,Mr.Wayne,DO Not Get THIS GUN it fools you if you want the clip. the clip does not come out and it loads from the top with like 15 bullets it is not even that fast if you want a shotgun get the spring utg shotgun its alot better
2,This gun is ok,I guess this gun is pretty good except for two reasons one its made out of cheap plastic and two it has VERY BAD accuracy the red dot is just a plastic screen with a red dot painted on it. If your looking for a good airsoft shotgun thats cheap too get the CH-0581C pump action shotgun.
1,It looks a lot cooler BEFORE you spend money on it,"I bought this just as a prop, it feels just about as crappy as it is. It's a super light weight hollow plastic thing that feels like you could buy it at the dollar store, and you probably could, the only reason it costs what it does is for the flashlight and laser sight that come with it to attach. I tried loading the little yellow beads in there they just pop all over the place with no precision. It looks really cool though especially with that flashlight and laser lit. It's an okay prop for say a swat costume or like that, but as an airsoft gun look elsewhere."
4,Pretty,The chain is very pretty and matched the site description exactly. Great value for the price!
5,Excellent healing tool for professionals and survivors.,The author manages to transmit sensitive information and exploration in an easy to read format. An important resource for professionals or survivors of mentally ill or emotionally dysfunctional families. I ordered several copies to share with clients.
3,"A bit dated, but still useful","One problem which children of mentally ill parents struggle with is that their lives, to this day, are still very much ""in the closet"". The author highlights this in her introduction; in the 24 years hence, little has changed. One consequence of this is that there are few books specifically for this demographic. So, while the exercises are a very simple form of CBT, I think the book has still value for it's target demographic. One is the seemingly trite but necessary message that one is not alone in this. The other one is the outright validation of experiences that children of mentally ill parents share, foremost the abject fear instilled by living with the unpredictability of mental illness at an age when most of us were way too young to have even the slightest understanding of what was going on."
5,good article,"nice video,nice product- it worths watching it. Well produced. inspiring,nourishing, beautiful.lovely and soft settlement,good exercises,fine exposition.hope more people enjoy it"
3,Decent shirt. Oddly sized. Not for the tall!,"I usually order 2X's because I'm 6'6"", and need the length. Unfortunately, after a couple of washes, the length was gone. Other than that, I love the shirt. Quality printing, great price... and it's Johnny Cash!"
1,Child's Play is childishly written,"Having never read anything by Cindy Harris, I energetically dove into the novel on the basis of the cover. I was disgusted by the lack of human experience displayed by the author in the first scene.A wife, struggling for breath from either asthma, congestive heart failure or more likely tuburculosis, encourages her husband to ""make love to me like you used to"" as she lay dying. Wow, now that is a sexy image. Anyone who has ever watched a loved one dying from a lung ailment knows that the last thing on their mind is sex. The remainder of the book plods along, having a few inspirations along the way and cute kids and their antics--but too few.I am struck by the lack of talent in some of these writers and I wonder how much nepotism is involved in their career. I'll be boycotting Zebra/Kensington for having the audacity to offer me such a thing for my hard-earned money."
4,i can't think of a name for this review,"With volume the plot thickens with the middle episode and duels on both sides which is a good way to do it. I always felt that it was really stupid that the duel with the goul is spilt up over 2 volumes at the time it would cost $40 to have both, but for the price of about $10 for both now. The main draw of this is the Mako v Yugi duel which has a great setting of an honorable opponet for yugi unlike the want to be evil bad guys like weivil and panik. With all that we do get so character devlopement for mokuba. If you are interested in the plot this is one of the best to get if your not then it is fair."
1,i`m a fan,OK season one at the end was cool like dungeon dice monsters but the beginning on the series sucks this is NOT WORTH THE BUY!!!!!!!
1,Wrong size battery - did not fit,This battery was not the right size for my phone - even though it is listed in the title. Cannot get the cover back on when battery is in. Battery is twice as thick as the original phone battery.
4,Better than the OEM battery,With a month's use so far in my VX8300 the charge life seems to be better than the OEM battery
1,Why All the Bad Language?,"I've already written two other review(see the rest of my reviews for more details) on this game, so I will make this brief. It has lots of profanity in it. I am not talking mild or even moderate. Don't be fooled by the fact that it is rated teen for ""realistic blood and violence."" Parents beware!"
2,Yipes!,"I used this text in one class for a PhD program that is now complete. Oh Boy! This is probably a good text if you have a very solid mathematics background, but it is totally incomprehensible to a mathematics greenhorn. I spent hours and hours trying to decipher the mathematical codes and formulas. Some of the symbols were figures I didn't even know existed.Applied? Nope - totally theoretical from stem to stern."
2,WARNING: If this text is required for your course,"You just might want to look into finding a supplimental text... JUST LIKE I AM RIGHT NOW.If you don't already have a firm grasp of linear algebra and concepts like eigenvectors, covariance matrices and partitioning you will learn to HATE this text.You've been warned.P.S. Can anyone recommend a supplimental text?"
1,NOT a good intro to MVA,"My prof used this book for multivariate statisitical analysis. I absolutely despise this book. For one, the answers to exercises come in a separate book, so the homework questions are worthless to me. The solutions will cost you an extra $100 or so if you buy that book. The index is extremely light, so if you want a quick reference to a topic - forget it. You'll need to skim through hundereds of pages that aren't referenced in the index. Important topics are illustrated in 1 example usually, and the reader is often left to guess how such problems could be adapted to different situations than what is illustrated."
2,"easy to understand, good examples.",A first review of the johnson's book let me taste a very friendly language to explain some difficult concepts of multivariate statistics. Good examples made this treatise almost a self-learning handbook for a specialized field of statistics that become esotheric in other books.
1,Ugh...this book was damn near incomprehensible,"My multivariate statistics course used this book, and the only time I cracked it was for the refresher problems in matrix algebra. The professor for the course was top knotch, so it didn't matter that much for me, but it would have been very difficult to have learned the methods if I had to rely on this book. The organization is terrible. Finding topics is difficult and the explanations of particular methods are obtuse and not very helpful for what is supposedly a book on ""applied"" multivariate analysis. It might be okay for a full-fledged statistician, but for a general researcher interested in applying multivariate statistics, I would find something else."
4,excellent book,"There have been many good theoretical texts on multivariate analysis including Anderson, Eaton and Gnandesikan. Tabachnick has written a popular applied text for the social sciences. Yet for many years this has been considered the best applied text. That is because the authors understand the theory and know how to balance it with applications. They also are excellent writers."
2,Don't judge a book by it's title...,"This book is primarily a theortical text that works in application. If your looking for an ""applied"" interpretation of Multivariate topics...KEEP LOOKING! This book is intended for statisticians and is complex even for graduate students. Read the matrix algebra sections first, and have a good software package available other than SAS. The SAS code for these applications are not straightforward. If the title were changed to downplay the application, I would give the book 5 stars because the theory is well written."
5,Subtly Powerful and Moving,This brief but beautiful book is filled with subtle nuances and powerful insight. A must-read for anyone who has a passion for politics or stories of relationships. One of the best books of the year it was released...or any year.
4,Black Dogs and Fright,"I liked ""Black Dogs"" actually more as time passes and I find myself thinking about it.Of course the meeting of the dogs was impressive but the fact that evil lies in us all,and ridding ourselves of it. could mean peace could be a possibility.This wouldn't be my favorite McEwan but better than some of his earlier ones."
1,The innocent?? More like the ridiculous!,"I really wanted to like this book. It's set in Berlin, cold war, all the things that interest me. This book never gets me to believe anything about the main character. He's incompetent at best. Time spent describing cardboard boxes is tedious, and we never get any detail about the actual tunnel or the spy element to this whole story. To say this book lacks suspense is a bit of an understatement. The whole story is preposterous....young man, unsure of himself, falls for first girl he sees....I thought a high school kid wrote this book. The author thinks that by dropping in a name of a famous street here and there, it is enough to place you in Berlin. It's not. Save the $15 and buy something else."
2,Not My Cup Of Tea,Can't say I cared much for this literary love story. The narrator describes his attempt to write a memoir about his separated parents-in-law. I don't know... it was all rather obscure to me.
2,Disappointment,I found that this was not my type of recreation reading. I could not relate to any of the characters nor did I find them compelling.
3,Beautiful example of author's beginning work with tragedy.,"McKewan's style begins to take shape in BLACK DOGS. I loved ON CHESIL BEACH and was looking forward to this work, but I found it less impressive than I was hoping.Still an interesting story and he has a wonderful way of really immersing the reader in each character."
2,My least favorite IM book,"This book to me never really got going...dragged on too long without much really happening and I could not like the main characters. IM has written much better books, esp. compared to this one."
3,Ian McEwan,"Ian McEwan's novel ""Black Dogs"" is not as good asmost of his work. I always look forward to hisbooks since I read ""Saturday"" but this was not asengaging."
5,"Subtle, thought provoking, and beautifully written","Take the time to search for this book in the library or used book store. It's one you'll want to loan to friends or read again yourself. There is so much in just 160 pages. A relationship, a memoire, a narrator's connection to the people he is writing about... Plus, the countryside of France and top notch writing. What more could you want?"
3,Wrinkly Sheets,"Love the sage color on this set, but they can't be used without ironing - they get VERY wrinkled after washing. Ironing is not my forte!"
3,Great Quality But High Maintenance,"These are quality sheets with a luxurious texture. However, they are not as care-free as standard permanent press sheets. Even after ironing, some wrinkling is evident."
2,A GOOD SLEEP,"With these sheets, I love getting into bed at night. The smooth texture feels good on the skin, and on a cool night they are cozy warm. My only criticism is that they need to be ironed to look nice."
5,Attention All Weird Al Freaks This is For You!!!!!!!,This DVD is the best if you have missed all of his concert's than this is the closest you will get to seeing what happened! And if your not a fan and you like to laugh and grove at the same time this is for you! 5 stars all the way for this must have Classic DVD or VHS.
5,About time this great concert ended up on DVD!,I played my VHS copy of this so many times I wore it out. I was very upset that I couldn't find it on DVD...until very recently. Now I am a happy camper! This concert shows Al in his prime. It's a great experience and I'm thrilled it's now available on DVD.
5,i have a question about wierd al,"what video has ""smells like nirvana""on it ,i would like to buy the video but i dont know which one it is..."
1,It sucks!!!,"I recieved this five days late and the DVD skips and pauses. The package was broken and it scratched the disk very badly! I have tried to contact Amazon about a replacement, but can't get thru to anyone! I don't think I will ever order from you again!"
3,A basic introduction,"I found this book a little disappointing. It is a collection of different drivers views of the handling of front wheel drive vehicles in different conditions. It gives one drivers view on tarmac, one on rally, another on ice and so on. It is interesting to see how each driver sets up their car, but that is something that varys from person to person. I didn't find it too objective, I was hoping for something that would give more tips about setup, weight distribution etc, so maybe if a few drivers had been included it would have allowed me to make more general assumptions about FWD setup that could be applied to my car. This is a good book, and is a starting point for learning to setup a FWD car, but I was personally hoping for a little more depth."
2,Less than expected,"Not the details on racing a front wheel drive car that I had hoped to learn from. Still, it had some good tips."
2,Not recommnded if looking for set up info,"Very light on tech info, not really much use to me. Only one chapter on road racing. More focuswed on driving techniques rather than setup"
2,could everything have changed in 20 years?,"Received the book and dove right in, as I was planning to drive my newly tweaked 2000 Honda Civic hatchback in an autocross near future. I set up the car as the autocross national champion (woman)suggested (e.g. ~40# pressure front, 34 back, and high tension coilovers front, soft rear). I thought it sounded strange, but who am I to challenge a national champion. When I got to the autocross to drive a front wheel drive car in an autocross for the first time (other car is a RWD Miata), the regional champ also driving a Honda Civic told me that that setup was exactly backwards. After changing to 34f/40r and soft shocks front/hard rear, the car drove great. Could things have changed that much???"
3,Good but slow shipping,I was happy to find this out of print book that is written by many people I know. It took over three weeks for me to receive it however! Part of the problem was this company didn't ship it out right away (I think it was a week or so). Then it took a couple of weeks to get it to me from USPS. I order things all the time and if I had known it would take so many weeks I would have ordered from someone else.The good thing was the book was as described.
3,Good but small,I bought this because I wanted clear bins to story my son's toys in and not the color ones you see everywhere. I was very disappointed in the size of the bins. They are very small. Think ladies shoe box size. The bins are not big enough to put anything of good size in. My son has a 60 count unit block set and it won't fit in 1 bin. If I had gotten the cheaper kind you see that has the color bins the blocks would fit in 1. I didn't return it because it would have been a hassel but I would NOT recommend this if you are trying to get something like the other storage systems you see that have color bins. Very disappointed in the size and price!
1,Arrived with color bins not clear,"I ordered this item based on the clear/white bin description but it comes with red, yellow and blue bins. That didn't work for the decor of my now older kids rooms so I returned it and received a prompt refund."
5,BEST WATCH I HAVE EVER BOUGHT,This watch is phenomenal......I had to take a link out but other than that it is very quality and goes with anything. I would buy this over and over any chance I could.
2,Way to spoil a good thing!,If you want to watch the real RED DWARF don't buy the remastered video's! They are classic and hilarious shows but the effect where video looks like film really hurts the enjoyment.
5,Fan-smegging-tastic!,"this has to be the greatest show of all time! due to the fact that i live in the us, i don't see much of it (smeg!) but i think it is so incredibly great!"
2,Could Be Worse?,"This light works, a little. I have not seen other GBA Advance lights, so I can't compare this to other products, but if this is any indication of how well these lights work, just buy save your money and buy a Gameboy SP or a DS for that matter."
1,don't waste your money,I bought this product and it is terrible. The light illuminates nothing and actually makes it HARDER to see because the magnifier is covering the screen. You can't tell if it actually makes the screen seem bigger because of the lack of light. Wasted my money!!
1,a little helpful,the light is somewhat dim but it is not meant to be used in complete darkness either the screen does help magnify it a little bit not something i would buy again.
4,Great return to the Firm!,"I am a more advanced home exerciser, but I really loved this DVD! I had done a lot of the Firm a few years ago and loved it then, but had fallen away from the Firm in the last couple of years because everything seemed like the ""same old, same old"". I read some good reviews for this one, so I gave it a try. I'm really glad that I did! The cueing is great, the moves are more innovative than I've seen from the Firm in the past. Allison is a very pleasant instructor. It's a nice break from some of the harder DVD's I usually do, but I still feel like I'm getting a good workout. I highly recommend!"
2,Too Easy + Long = Boring,"I kept waiting for the challenging part. The same un-challenging movements were repeated way too many times. I think you can burn more calories with 15 min. in a treadmill than the 45 minute work out. I'll write the company and see if they can give money back or replace with a different, actually challenging exercise dvd."
5,Cardio and weight training that flys by,"I have a vast workout DVD library and this one has climbed to the top of my favorites list. I always feel I get a great workout when I do it, but it's not one that I dread doing. The way the combos are built is actually fun and fast paced while also challenging-- but not so much that I feel like I'm gonna pass out. I wish there were more like this one!"
2,Cueing could be a lot better,"I own several Firm dvds, and I like Alison, but her cueing could be a lot better on this one. This is a fast-paced classic aerobic workout. Not much use of weights here. The moves are so fast and change so often, I found it frustrating, and I'm usually able to do fairly complex moves with no problem. I was disappointed with this one."
3,I didn't love this one!,"This DVD was weird for me. There was lots of jumping/high impact movement, and I did sweat, but I didn't really feel like my heart was pumping. I didn't hate it, but didn't love it enough to keep it. Glad I rented through Netflix before purchasing."
3,April,"I was really excited to get this workout, always trying to find new and fun cardio videos. Although this might be a great video for some, I did not like it. It was very danced based with fast moves that were not explained by the instructor. By the time I would pick up a move she whould be on to the next one. I love cardio but I also like to relax my mind during my workouts and with this one I think my mind worked harder than my body."
2,"Too much dancing, not enough sweating!","Wasn't the worst workout DVD I have ever seen - but it is not the best choice if you are lookin to get sweaty, feel tough, and feel like you got a great total-body workout. Steps are a little quick without enough bang for your buck...would skip this one."
1,Wow,"This video is ridiculous. It just reminds me of the super fast-paced aerobic videos my mom used to do in our living room when I was little. It is soooo fast paced and I had a really hard time keeping up with the moves. A lot of moves are used over and over again, which is good because that made it somewhat possible to keep up. It was discouraging because I felt like I couldn't do the workout properly. This was a tough video for me, and not in a good way. I probably won't be putting it into my DVD player again any time soon. My opinion is biased though, I much prefer yoga and strength training videos, and I like to get my cardio in from jogging or on the elliptical. So take my review with a grain of salt, because I am new to this type of video."
1,too many dance moves,"This video is waaaaaaaay to complicated. I enjoy the Firm DVD'S that focus on strength training, but this particular instructor moves way too fast. If you never grew up dancing, this is not the video for you! The triple balls changes were way over my head, and she moves so fast with very little repetition its hard to catch on. The high def--sculpt--is great...and the kickboxing DVDS are good too."
5,"Easy to learn, Easy to Do","I'm happy with this product. After renting it first from Netflix, I was pleased and chose to purchase it. I'm not a beginner, but I like the fact that there are enough repetitions to make it easy enough to follow, but also challenging enough to make me break a sweat."
5,LOVE IT!,"I have many Firm dvd's and this one is definitely awesome! Alison is always a favorite, the entire video is so much fun, and works up an incredible sweat. Love it!"
1,Useless as an everyday alarm.,"I like the styling, and the ease of setting the two alarms.I dislike:Poorly functioning radio tuner, with the dial numbers having little relation to the actual station numbers. Anyway, radio reception is intermittent, from fair to very poor.LCD display backlight does not function in battery mode; how are you supposed to read the clock, if you can't see the numbers? Or, is this clock for folks who sleep days? Hmmm.Only 5 minutes snoozing per hit on the snooze button, to a max of 25 minutes. I'm a slow starter, I need longer snooze intervals, and more total snooze time.However, the little female voice in ze French accent which tells you ""alarm on"" is kinda handy for the technically challenged person.I gave it to my 8-year-old niece, who uses it to tease her dog with the rooster alarm. NB: I think the dog hates it as much as I do."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS ALARM CLOCK,"Here's why it's lousy:1) It has a 5 minute snooze button (useless)2) The alarm turns itself off after 25 min of snoozing. This will result in many days of oversleeping and being late to work/school.3) The ""rooster"" wakeup sounds like a cat throwing up.4) Amazon's return policy sucks so you'll be stuck with it.ENJOY!"
3,"Good Alarm, Not very loud","I personally like a loud alarm clock, because I tend to sleep through almost anything. I purchased the Rooster Alarm clock hoping it would be loud, and a different type of noise.The noise is good, and it slowly gets louder, but its not nearly loud enough. I have a queen sized bed, and my alarm is at the foot of my bed, so needless to say I now use the Rooster alarm and my old alarm."
5,I have volume 2 and 3,"I also have the movie! My favorite stunt on this DVD is ""the omelette"". In my opinion, THE BEST PART OF BREAKFAST! {no, not really}. All of the other stunts are....different...sort of in their own way. I haven't watched the t.v. show on MTV, but I have seen and own volume 2 and 3 and the movie. The reason the stunts are different are because some of them may end up being shocking, but they're cool anyway. If you want a good laugh, watch some of them. Trust me. Have faith in yourself, and I say that to whomever reads this review. I think there should be a sequel to the movie because these guys can do....pretty much whatever they want. Enjoy!"
5,Jack ass vol 3,this video is fu*king funny as hell. if you see jack ass the movie and liked it. you have to see this one. it keeps on getting better and funny. a must have for any jack ass fan
4,Super glue to the rescue!,"Yes, the little rubber sides do fall off after a while. I just super glued them back on permanently! The mouse is just too perfect to dispose of over a silly little thing like that."
2,"Good mouse, with a fatal flaw","The buttons are fine, as is the technical use of the mouse. Your standard five button optical mouse.Other than the mouse's shape, there are two ergonomic features: a cushy palm rest, and two rubber finger pads on either side of the mouse. These rubber pads are glued on.I didn't know they were glued on until they slid off.An unfortunate flaw for an otherwise good mouse."
5,"COMO DICE LA CANCION, ""CUANDO QUIERE UN MEXICANO""","LES PUEDO DECIR QUE, COMO RIE UN MEXICANO y como reímos los demás con su ingenio, NO HAY RISAS COMO SUS RISAS !"
1,Mad Mother,This book tries too hard to be PC(Politically Correct) in my opinion. The lesbian chapter was over the top. Having sex was too easily accepted as what you do when you want to. My 14 year old is fairly mature but is definitely not ready for this book. I returned it.
5,Another Hit CD of The Supremes and The Temptations!!!!,"This is so far, one of the best albums of The Supremes and The Temptations put together. It's better than the other CD's put out of The Supremes and The Temptations. Not only do you get the songs from the two albums that they did together, but you get extended songs, unreleased songs, alternate mixes and a spoken enterance to ""I'm Gonna Make You Love Me."" It's a must for Supremes, Temptation and Motown fans! It's the best!!"
5,Simply Fantastic!!!!!!!!,"This collection is just wonderful. There are so many tidbits of interesting information and the sound is perfection. The spoken intro of ""I'm Gonna Make You Love Me"" is done by the producer himself Frank Wilson. All of the unreleased material is top notch and the Mono versions of the songs are the best,I have fallen in love with ""Sing A Simple Song.In Mono it cannot be beat. You will totally enjoy hearing ""Amen"" where each Supreme gets a verse. The clincher is the two very rare pics of the beautiful and sexy Florence Ballard with Melvin Franklin and Paul Williams of the Temptations backstage in the summer of 1967. Get this disc you WILL NOT BE DISSAPOINTED."
5,DREAM COME TRUE,"This release is a dream come true. PLACE IN THE SUN, WHY, AMEN and I'm GONNA MAKE YOU LOVE Me are the highlights but all the songs shine with the scent of hope and Magic. Diana is clearly the STAR and the cast of thousands are in AWE of her magic. I SECOND THAT EMOTION, HOUSE IS NOT A HOME, and most of the covers are better than the originals - Miss Ross is stunning. The weakest song, the WEIGHT is an effort at fitting Motown with the Rock of the era and comes out as dated - nevertheless Miss Ross does a great job with tEmpts"
5,David Babcock,"My wife and I LOVED it. The intro on ""Im Gonna Make You Love Me"" was great...LOL. Buy this double cdif you are a fan ."
3,a childhood dream come to life,"i was happy that someone somewhere took it upon themselves to re-release these two albums on cd. outside of showing off diana ross though, they have no seemingly obvious raison d'etre. she's not in her finest form on most of the cuts. but she does sizzle on 'try it, baby' and does a beautiful, sophisticated take on 'a house is not a home'.what these cuts, as well as others, show is how underused mary wilson and cindy birdsong would be until ross left the group. they also show how ungentlemanly dennis edwards and david ruffin could be. they just push ross out of the way when the time is right and they're ready to be cock of the walk. that's the fun of this compilation."
5,Read this Book!,"If you watched the Simpson trial and wondered, ""Why didn't Nicole just leave?""; if you ever thought that women who stayed in abusive relationships must somehow ... well, like it, or deserve it, or be weird; if you're a woman who ever thought ""It could never happen to _me_"", then you should read this book.And if you've never wondered or thought about battering at all, or if you're a man, or if you're a woman, then you should read this book.An eye-opening, sickening, and incredibly revealing look at battered women and abusive men and society's response to them both."
1,Big dissapointment!,"I thought I had found the cookware set of my dreams! Unfortunately, the dream lasted only a short-while.Just after a month of cooking, the nonstick lining started ripping off on saucepan and then on omelette pans. This despite the highest level of care I was doing- using calphalon silicon utensils, using barkeepers' friend (which is recommended on calphalon website). The only thing I can guess is that I was cooking on moderate heat but if that is enough to break apart an expensive nonstick lining, I'd stay away from this product. I cannot imagine not being able to use the cookware for boiling water or soups for example."
2,"Cookware is fine, but bonus item STILL NOT HERE","I like the cookware. Solid as Calphalon always is, If you follow the link on the Bonus item, it shows a 1-2 day availability. Today is Dec 26, ordered on Nov 9. Still waiting for the bonus."
4,Fits well. Looks great.,"It fits snug, but try not to tighten the strap under the hood too much, it will rip. Also, the mesh material in front of the grill is a little disappointing. There is no way to secure it, it's just left loose at the top, so it sags a little. I might try some small zip-ties to tighten it. It's easy to install, I like the fender clips. You have to tuck it around the headlights/signals housings for a good fit. As far as I can tell, it doesn't flop and flap around at highway speeds. The top of the hood section is well designed for this(not as pictured, it has a heavy triangular bead or welt) For the money, I'm pretty happy with it. It looks great and will do the job well. Just be prepared, you might have to do a little creating fitting"
3,Not the Quality You'd Expect from LeBra,"Everything was fine until you ""install"" the bra and find out real quick that the fasteners are all plastic....not good since you're putting tension on them through attaching the bra under the hood, etc. The plastic fasteners broke on installation and my husband followed the directions. The bra had to be ""rigged"". You can't tell from the outside."
2,LeBra front end cover,"item did fit well, drove my vehicle in town and hwy through summer and winter months, but the cover stiching started to come apart in nine months."
5,Vibrant!,"This disc contains different interpretations of some of Lionel Hampton's best known tracks. The Benny Goodman Quartet is prominently featured throughout. From the teasing signature tune Stompin' At The Savoy to the rollicking Stompology, Hampton will have you grooving! Highly recommended.Extensive liner notes are included in both English and French. Most tracks exhibit some level of tape hiss, which is to be expected of recordings from the 30's. If anything, it adds to the free-wheeling, informal atmosphere."
5,Perfect for the sound sleeper like me,"I was searching for a clock that was capable of actually waking me. This is it. The ""sonar"" alarm does actually wake me up. Have no fear though, the buzzer and frog alarms offer others looking for less of a jolt a more serene wake up. The radio even picks up my favorite public radio station even though it doesn't have that strong of a signal. I also like that the display is not glowing all night, but if you push the dial it lights up; sometimes the glow from an alarm clock keeps me from sleeping.The only remotely negative thing I can say is that it is battery operated. I hope it doesn't go through batteries quickly but I haven't had it long enough to tell. Also, when the description says you ""Rotate the clock to change the alarm"" it means the entire clock. It is a sphere and has guides on the back that keep it from rolling away."
2,form should follow function,"I'm updating this, after 4 years, I still have it and use it. Its actually grown to me and works fine. Battery life isn't too bad either, I change like once every 6 months.I've had this clock for about 3 months now. Its a funky looking clock radio, but the usage is cumbersome. First, the buttons are tiny, so if you fumble around for the radio. Second, since this is battery operated the back light is pretty dim, so you really have to focus late at night.Wait for ver 2."
3,Hum!?!,"Was really expecting something big, specially after seeing Sex in the City. Entertaining, better than Lipstik Jungle but definitly not the quality of Sex in the City!"
2,"Vapid, but Clothes Shoes Purses!!!! visual is great!","for women who love fashion, this is a video fashion mag. The writing is terrible, but it's worth it to watch Lucy Liu walk out of her closet 3 times a day looking like a work of art!"
1,Cashmere BARFia,"I can't believe so many people liked this show. The four main women were as interesting as dry, plain toast. Nothing can beat Sex and the City and Lipstick Jungle was more realistic as to how me and my girlfriends lead our lives here in Manhattan. We can relate to the women of Lipstick Jungle than the four dry pieces of toast from Cashmere Mafia. I'm glad it's over. I hope for it to never return. I couldn't stomach another over the top dramatic moment with that uptight, tight lipped Julia Draper. If it does return, I won't be wasting my time. I'd be more entertained by watching paint dry."
3,"I liked the show, but...","I'm sorry, but I can't see buying this DVD for 7 episodes.Maybe when it drops down to $14 or so it will make sense, but its notlike they have a bunch on unbroadcast episodes that I feel I must see."
5,Better than Sex in the City,"This show was much better. At least everybody wasn't sleeping with everybody and they didn't look like cheap hookers. The show was great, they should bring it back."
3,HUM..,"Quiet shallow albeit entertaining. I have watched the first disc but the second one can wait. Not crazy about it, did not fall in love with any of the characters."
2,Not a major improvement,"Did not notice a major improvement but used only for one month. However, I took lazartigues vitamins suppl for hair during 3 months after damaging my hair with color and had new hair growing!! Even my long time hairdresser noticed it!"
3,"Paid more for a ""Hardcover"" book when I received a ""Board Book""","I was very upset when received this book. After I ordered the book listed as ""Hardcover"" I realized there was another listing for ""Board Book"" which I thought would have suited my child better. However, there was nothing I could do about it since the book had already shipped. When I received the book, it was actually the Board Book, but its frustrating that I paid more money for by selecting the ""Hardcover"" edition and not the ""Board Book"" when in fact they are one in the same. Amazon needs to remove the listing for ""Hardcover"" or just make the prices the same."
2,SO SO,I was not that impressed with this book although the flaps are really fun to open and look at. The story line is too long and detailed for very young toddlers and the is really not as detailed as it should be for older ones. I will keep it and give it to the Salvation Army.
5,Great beginner bible for the baby!,"My grandson loves this book. It's engaging enough for a 2o month old as well as a 3 year old. Pictures are clear, language is easy enough for very young children to grasp and the ""open the flap"" pages are entertaining. Great book overall as a first bible."
2,Inferior to the original,"The original Flatout was fun on several levels, but the best thing was the ability to head off the track and explore. It was great for 2-player, particularly for ""jump contests""...find a huge hill and see who can jump farthest and/or crash the best!Flatout 2, on the other hand, summarily puts you back in the track if you stray very far. What were they thinking?"
5,LOve This,"This was a gift for grandson, he loved this game He said he played it constantly after he received.I had trouble finding in the store!Thank you AMAZON for making it so easyNana Bloc"
3,Fun for a while,"This game is totally addicting for a while. when I first got it I could not stop smashing imto other cars and watch the cool effects when that happens, but I found that this game got old really fast!"
4,"Graficas Geniales, tal vez un poco complicado","Bien veamos, las gráficas son excelentes, inclusive llegan a ser preciosas, los movimientos geniales, la historia tambien es buena, poco predecible, se juega genial, el único pero que le pondría es que en ocasiones se vuelve un poco dificil de pasar, claro que esto no es obstáculo para cualquier video jugador que se enorgullezca de si mismo. Ahh se me olvidaba la música, realmente te transporta fuera de este mundo. En conclusión te encantara tener este juego, al principio los movimientos pueden llegar a ser un poco confusos, pero despues de un par de dias sabras bien que es lo que estas haciendo."
1,disappointment,I ordered Ninga Gaiden as a gift for my son. I ordered the wrong one. I have requested a return authorization twice online and have not recieved one. I can't find a phone number for customer service. I seldom order from the internet. Maybe i won't again. *(Springledge Entertainment.Inc)
2,TOO HARD!!!,"This game is the hardest game I have ever played. I like the original better at least you can get passed the first level. I bought this game with my Xbox, and I nearly broke my controller in half fighting to the first boss! If you have ADD or anger problems don't play this game or you'll kill someone. I almost did..."
2,WHY SO HARD!!!!!,WHAT CAN I SAY ? THE GAME LOOKS GOOD. THE ACTION FAST.BUT YOU WON'T GET TO ENJOY IT WHY BECAUSE THE GAME IS SO DAMN HARD!!!!!!!!!!!
5,ninja gaiden,if u like a chaleng this is a game for youset in anchent Japanyour mission is to hut and kill lord godathis game has stuning 3D graphics and amazing game playif you like to sit for hours and hours then you shoud buy this game i have had the game for about 7 day and im half wat through it. this game isent for a beginer eveny im have a hard time with it but it allso keeps me entetandthis game is amazing
4,Attack of the Idiots,This is a good game that is very entertaining so far. I've only been playing for a couple of days. It seems to offer a vast array of attack combinations as well as a large assortment of weapons. ...
4,Great fun but gets very hard,This game has great graphics great sound and some nice action fun but when you get to the boss of each stage the game just gets ridiculusly hard. I would of given it 5 stars if it just didnt do this but it does. I wanted to give it 3.5 stars but cant select half stars since i think 3 stars is to low and 4 might be a bit high. So once you get this game be prepared for those boss fights and stock up on life pots every chance you get
5,Quite simply the best...,"Yes it has a learning curve, but there is no better action game for Xbox. Period.The game forces you to master the controls before you pass the first level, but once that happens, look out. Nothing is smoother, faster, looks better, or is more fun."
3,Over hyped (please don't kill me),"ok you probably are all growling at me for using such a title, but hear me out! Ninja Gaiden first of all is an extremley gorgeous game, on any system. It's action is fast paced Devil May Cry style and it does have some puzzles to break up the action. But man is this game hard. It's not the kind of hard that is beatable after a couple of times trying. For example there are some moments where these 3 packs of super cheap ninjas (you all know them, the ones who throw like a billion explosive shurikens at you and kill you before you take one down) appear right when you load the game and end up killing you before you know whats happening! plus the action can get a bit hectic, i found myself usually just standing in one stop blocking and waiting for someone to get close (and the fact that the guards do this unblockable grab move all the time really is annoying!) so finally I'd like to say, good game, but to hard to be any fun"
4,great but hard game,this is a great game.the graphics are awsome.you probably couldn't beat this game without the strategy guide.but this is the best game on xbox!
5,this game is really really awesome,if you're lookin for a really cool fighting ninja game this game is the best game ever. I would recommend it to anybody. This game is really worth buying.
2,Overrated,"After playing this game for an hour you'll either love it or hate it with a passion. I would fall into the hate with a passion category. I haven't experienced anything this frustrating to play since BATMAN-DARK TOMORROW. Sure it's pretty to look at, but the awkard control scheme and the unbelievable bad camera work sucks all the fun out of this game. Plus, it gets too hard too fast. Having some kind of in-game training dojo to hone your skills would be very helpful instead of having to do the old trial and error thing over and over and OVER again. My advice would be to rent it first to see it's your kind of game. My copy is going into the trade-in pile."
5,"Excellent, Cool, Well Planned and Fun too",This Game is a challenge it makes you focus on your task at hand.
2,The insane difficulty kills this game,"I had this game a few years back,and it was without a doubt,one of the top five hardest games I have EVER played in my life.Words cannot describe how hard this game is.It's really a shame too,because this game is actually really cool.The graphics,the music,the story...all of that is excellent.It's just too dang hard! If you get agrovated easily...then I HIGHLY recommend that you do NOT buy this game.If you want one of the hardest games ever made...then go for it."
5,good job my friends,"good buying the fastest shiping in earth, thank you so much you can trust and buy with them anytime any hour any day 5 stars for you guys. att Ryu well done xpowerx"
1,Hardest Game Ever!!!!!!!!!,DON'T BUY THIS GAME unless you have hours and hours of frustration time. This game will leave you throwing you controller and cursing the at the TV. Only NORMAL and HARD difficulties to choose from makes the game impossible to beat.
4,A pretty good game,"This game is pretty fun and the graphics are unbelievably stunning. I would give it five stars but its ubsurdly difficult boss battles and enemy ai that is just flat out annoying, brings it down a notch. dont get me wrong but this is a really fun game. Techmo did a pretty good job of reviving this game from its original 2d platforming gameplay. I wouldnt reccommend this one for the little ones because of some pretty gorey kill moves and combos. This is a pretty awsome game and it is really fun to spend some time with, until you spend some quality time with some of the bosses."
4,this by far the best one player game out!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,the gragfices in this game are peerfect and the game play is thriling. you have tones of wepens and a lot of moves. you have to buy this game!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5,"Ninja Gaiden rocks and if you don't think so, you're lame","This game is unbelievable. I can't understand anyone thinking that this game is bad. This is the ONLY GAME ON THE MARKET worth the $50 that it MAY cost. I'd pay $70. Good games are few and far between and if you're one of those ""this game is too hard"" wimps you need to suck it up and be tough. Be persistent because if you aren't playing Ninja Gaiden, you're missing the whole damn boat. Fo' sho'. I've played through if a few times, and I don't plan on stopping now. I hope a sequel's in the works."
4,Ninjatastic,"Absolutely best ninja game in a long time. You've probably already read all 90 some odd reviews so I'll just say taht the camera can be annoying at times if only for the fact that at times you cant see the great action, but you will not lose because of it. It easily adjusts with the righ trigger, dont make that the reason not to buy this amazing game. Also the game is hard, but its still fun as all hell. I've died repeatedly on some occassions and still love playing over those parts."
5,Ninja Gaiden is a great RPG,"I haven't played very many levels on this game, since I only have a demo, but it's a very fun game. The game reminds me of Zelda and Mortal Kombat. The adventure is similar to Zelda and the combat with enemies is similar to Mortal Kombat. There is a good choice of weapons you can get. I like how you can kill animals in the background. I know that's not relavent to the objective of the game, but it's still cool. The whole combo hit thing impresses me. I understand the demo doesn't give you a full perspective on the game, but it gives you an idea, and it's helping me decide whether or not I want this game. Anyway, if you like RPG's and Mortal Kombat or Soul Calibur, I'd recommend this game."
5,"frustrating, difficult, will make you pull your hair out...","but it is still a fun game to play. I find myself yelling and saying how much I hate it, but I can't seem to put it down. The graphics are top notch.The only thing I don't like about it is the camera angle. Can be difficult at times especially when you're trying to get away from enemies or jumping around to get something.It's a great game. Beating it will give you a sense of satisfaction."
4,Fo Shizzle dizzle!!,The game is gonna be the major Biggity Bomb!!! It will Roxxorz!!I will be taking a nap at Wal Mart the day before it comes out so that I will own this game for the rest of my life. I think I may sleep with it for the first few nights after I get it. Ninja Gaiden is the BIIIIIIIIIZZZZZOOOMB!! I'm gonna destroy all dem Mounsters.
1,This game's gonna be hot!,"This game is definately gonna be hot. Don't mind the guy who mad at people who rate games before they are released since he gave it a 5 star rating himself. I specifically remember seeing a video preview that was about 3 minutes long on a preview disc that came with my Xbox magazine long before he saw it a some show. So maybe other people saw that demo too, eh? Don't be so quick to judge there pal. Anyway, buy this game, it's gonna rock!"
5,This game is awsome (based on demo version),Ok the graphics in this game are beautiful and its pretty gorey (and thats a good thing) The controls are easy i cant get how its hard to get used to get to the controls the controls are just how they should be and the difficulty could of been a little bit easier but it just makes it more challenging i cant wait to get the full version of the game just the demo got me playing it for hours .
5,Great but Ninja Gaiden Black better.,"I purchased this game after purchasing ninja gaiden black only because it has an old NES game that I wanted to check out.The first thing I want to mention about this game and the black version is that black has more enemies.2. It has an easy setting for those who cant hack it.3. The camera angles have been much improved over this version.3. It has 50 side missions.4. It has been much improved indeed. So if your looking to to purchase this game maybe you should reconsider and get black.besides that this is one of best games on any system (including the 36o, and ps3)"
5,Awsome,"First of all, I want to point out that this game is hard. But thats nothin to wine and complain about. It makes the game more challenging. Besides if you get boggled down by enimes, ITS CALLED THE LEFT TRIGGER! it blocks any attack. Anyway, the graphics are great, the gameplay is great. Think of Prince of Persia mixed with soul caliber. Somewhat like that but on crack. This game is one of the best games on any system. The weapons are all different, with different moves for each one. They feel completly different from each other. Theres nunchucks swords, war hammer. And for the throwing weapons, theres throwing stars and a bow which you can go in to first person and shoot (for all you FPS fans). Bottom line, you'd have to be crazy not to at least rent this game.!EMAG SIHT YUB. (subliminal messaging)"
3,Good and Bad,"It is great to see a comic book aimed at teenage girls, there should be a lot more of them. The small size allows it to go on the shelf with the manga rather then with the comic trades.The problem is that the comic itself is quite predictable and nothing that is any more interesting then what one would find on any of the television dramas aimed at teenage girls. It is also a very fast read for six dollars.It is great to see Marvel (in this case, though i could easily be saying DC also) marketing something like this, I only wish that it would have been something better."
1,Don't believe these 5 star reviews,"It's been rumored that the author herself is coming here to write the great reviews about her book. It's really a pity too. As someone who has read the book I can tell you it ain't worth the paper it's printed on. This woman has a serious problem with the fact that Sarah or her management wouldn't allow her to interview them. Sarah's management tried to get the printing stopped because the book contains so many inaccuracies in it. Sarah McLachlan has never, not once, in one single interview called Uwe Vandrei a murderer, rapist or stalker. Uwe thought that she was insinuating that she was. This book is a total crock. Spend your money on a Sarah cd or Sarah song book, please don't waste your money on this book. It's really not worth it. It's only stuff that's already been in print, and a desperate attempt to make money off of Sarah's name."
1,Not about Sarah,"This book isn't about Sarah McLachlan. It's about Judith Fitzgerald and her lame conspiracy theories about Uwe Vandrei. The new Sarah music book contains lots more information, plus it's authorized and you get lyrics and music. Take it from someone who read this book cover to cover and don't waste your money. You can find all the interviews in the book on the web. Judith Fitzgerald didn't even get to interview Sarah or her management. This book is trash."
1,Wow.,I can die now. I have read THE WORST BOOK EVER MADE!!! The poor reviews you are reading about the book are entirely true. I can't believe I read the whole thing. WHY???
3,An original Vancouver fan from way back when at A&A Granville,"How the heck does 'A Customer' get so many chances to write the same review with the words in a different order? That's like boting a hundred times on election day.Well..... My friend Steve didn't record the New York Theatre show like I had urged him to, that I will never forget. Those old bootlegs we had were great though. The Point Roberts shows especially. Thanks Cam.What year did she get a nose job is all I wanted to know. And I'm not buying a book to find that out."
4,Not a bad book...,"Building a mystery is not a bad book but it is a little out of date. The writer should add more about lilith fair now that sarah has done it so successfully. Whether or not I like all the stuff in the book or not is not so important as the fact that even Sarah's unauthorized biographer is unique and special and different and her style shows taht much. I have read lots of trashy bios but this is something else and not trashy at all. It's a bit smart-alecky and arrogant at times but I think the great writing in the book answers that complaint. If I could write like Judith, I'd be smart-alecky, too. Interesting. Come to think of it, I'd be a lot more smart-elecky ~P. So, judith, write the sequel and make up for the skinny lilith chapter and make all us Sarahmaniacs (tm) happy for a change, please?"
1,Please.,"To the woman who gave this book a five-star review: If you're going to criticize other reviewers for their misspellings, you might want to proofread your own review first.Please. This book is very poorly written, and the author is obviously an egomaniac with a vendetta against Sarah. My advice to the author is that she find a life of her own, as well as a new career, because she's no writer."
1,Kindergartener's writing,"This book had a very convoluted plot and very contrived plot, that I, frankly, could not follow. Not surprising, considering the conclusions and bs could have only been the product of a kindergartener's writing. The book was probably made as a vehicle to try to get the author into the book world, but if that was its goal I would have to say that I hope she didn't invest too much money in its production."
1,Definitely an Allan Smithee,"Alright, the writer should have used the infamous movie alias of Allan Smithee, this thing is so bad. She probably wrote this book for a paycheck. But what a waste, if I had all the resources she did, I would basically say to forget the sniping, and actually make it good. Anybody could have done this. On a scale of 1 to 10, ""Building A Mystery"" gets a 1! ( I wish we could vote zero)!"
1,Looking for a good book? Look elsewhere.,"If you went into this book looking for great writing, a quality plot, excellent research, and stunning information - oh boy, did you come to the wrong place! However, if you like a bad book that will allow you and your friends to revel in it's inadequacies - you've come to the right place."
1,use the library!,This book isn't worth your money...but if your curious to read it like I was--just to get a better feel for what people are talking about when they say it's bad--please use the LIBRARY! I don't think Fitzgerald should receive any of our money.
1,Can I rate it less than 1 star???,"Fitzgerald needs to find a new soapbox, because this one isn't going anywhere. She's disguised her jealousy of Sarah McLachlan's success by implying that the book somehow comes from a journalist who would never have any reason to say bad things about Sarah. Fitzgerald has an agenda, and it's about promoting herself by lying about someone famous. Fitzgerald needs to get her own life."
2,So Strange!,"A poorly written, ridiculously subjective, and distracted attempt at a biography (if you can call it that). When my wife asked how it was, all I could do was shake my head and mutter, ""It's so strange...."" The book's marginal value lies only in its very small nuggets of early McLachlan info."
1,Can't believe I paid for it,"This thing came out a while back, and I thought I should read it - but I spent the whole time waiting to read something good. At the end I couldn't believe that I had paid for the privelege of reading it. By far the worst part is the end - where's the climax? It just gets to the end and stops."
1,Something boring this way comes,"I was yawning after the first chapter. I didn't see what all the hub bub was about, bub. Why would Sarah want this book blocked? There's nothing in there that's worth her time, let alone getting her lawyers on the case. Sarah was right, any of the dirt that the author thought she was digging up was more like non-dirt, and quite out in the open. It's all just a bunch of blah, blah, blah, Uwe Vandrei, blah, blah. Overall, I'd say it's pretty blah! ; D"
1,See-saw,"We all do dumb things. In Judith Fitzgerald's case, it was writing this book. There is no explanation for why there are so many positive reviews of this book. Apparently those people and me were reading totally different books. Seems too much like they want everybody to think that this book's good. Got news for 'em! It wasn't worth my time, or my eye strain! So much Sarah-bashing going on in it that us seems like a real fan of Sarah's would like it. Which are you?"
1,Old news,"There's nothing here that isn't everywhere, so why waste your time trying to cope with the tediuos writing? It's hard to keep reading when the cheesy language keeps making you laugh so hard that you drop the book every five minutes. All the cute, trite words may be appropriate for email, and the internet, but not when you're trying to convince people that you should be taken seriously. A little time and a search engine can give you the same results as reading this book, without the verbose stupidity, and without paying 12 dollars for it. Not to mention that you can get much more accurate information than you'll ever get from this book. Only a really stalwart individual could read this thing in one sitting and not fall asleep!"
1,Not up to snuff,"I have high standards for books that are supposed to be biographical. Sometimes you get what you're expecting, sometimes not. In this case, I got something I didn't want. What I did want was a book about Sarah McLachlan that didn't try to sensationalize the events in her life. If you expect that from this book, you'll be disappointed. Without an interview, I'd say that Fitzgerald had to scrape up whatever she could get, and just make do with it. Her writing style isn't much, it's not really suited to this type of book, but it's apparent she thought that this was a way to grab readers without having very interesting material. It's obvious that this is just another drop in the bucket for the music biography world."
1,"An insult to my intelligence, this book was beyond poor.","Words cannot explain how bad this book actually is. I simply cannot believe someone released this trash. This book was very misleading. Almost all the writing in this SLAB OF BILE was innuendo after supposition after guess. Stay away from this garbage, it isn't even worth reading for free. I will never get back the time I spent reading this (yes, I read through the whole thing) and I hope to spare you the agony of one of the worst books ever made."
1,Less fun than a root canal,"Unfortunately, this is what passes for biography these days. If you have an IQ lower than four, chances are you'll think this is the greatest book ever.Hmm, I remember reading this book a while back...and I must say it is STILL one of the few books I ever just refused to finish...there was a fourth of the book left and I was not gonna make myself read it.. Was this book up to standard?? Oh god no...not even CLOSE. THIS book barely has a plot, I refuse to believe it does...I was just shaking my head the whole time, because I had actually read reviews saying that this book was GOOD...imagine my surprise...the whole book?? Not amusing...more or less stupid...I'll go with the more option there...anyways if anybody out there hasn't read this yet...save yourself the money and don't bother."
1,Sad state of affairs...,"It is a sad state of affairs that Sarah McLachlan has to be written about this way. This book is a lifeless rehash of magazine and newspaper quotes, never breaking any new ground in any direction. The portrayal of the characters is basically weak and lacking, superficially covering Sarah's life. It is difficult for most biographies to show the real person under all hype, but even considering that fact, this book is a journey into the inane."
1,Disappointed,"I was stoked to get this book when I found out that it existed,but I was sorry I read it when I was through. What was the big deal?It seemed like this book was lashing out at Sarah instead of being a biograhphy about her. There's snide little jabs everywhere. I'm sorry but there are to many coincidences in this book to be real. I don't believe any of the baloney about Sarah being at all involved in that stalker's death. What would she gain? For him to stop his BS lawsuit? For him to quit being all obsessed with her? I keep seeing this author talking about how there ""was an agreement in principle"" in a settlement of that lawsuit. What she always fails to mention is that this agreement was for Sarah to write the guy a letter telling him she didn't use his words, and that Sarah would NOT meet him by any means. Too much hype, and not enough reality in this book."
1,"M.O. is the same, don't like this style","After reading this book, and seeing the way that Judith Fitzgerald behaves, especially on Sarah newsgroups, I'd have to say that I hope I never have the displeasure of meeting her in person. Ms. Fitz is rude, obnoxious, and psychotic. This also comes across in her writing style, both in this book, and in her wild rantings on Usenet. Want to know the real mystery, folks? How the publisher thought it was a good idea to put this book out, for sure! Don't waste your money on a book written by a hanger on looking to make some dough from riding on Sarah's coattails. Support Sarah, and buy her music instead."
1,TRASH,"This is utter crap about Canada's finest singer/songwriter Sarah McLachlan. Yeah, and ""Fitz"" wants us to believe that Sarah had a nosejob? Her nose hasn't changed, and for one, I cannot believe that for Fitz to say she's a fan of Sarah's would actually put this garbage out. I only give it one star for that nice picture of Sarah playing the electric guitar. Besides, there are only A FEW pictures! TRASH!"
1,Building a Mystery: The Story of Judith Fitzgerald,"When I heard about this book, I thought Great, a book about Sarah McLachlan! Wow! Was I wrong. Half of the book was about Judith Fitzgerald. When I heard the title I thought I would find some new exciting stuff about Sarah McLachlan. Instead, I found nothing new about Sarah McLachlan. I found everything out about Judith Fitzgerald. The title of the book was all wrong. Well, I guess half of it was right. It sure was a mystery as to what the book was about. But the part about the story of Sarah McLachlan and Lilith Fair is all wrong. If you want to learn about Sarah McLachlan and Lilith Fair,don't buy this book, buy From Lilith to Lilith Fair, the AUTHORIZED biography by Buffy Childerhose. If you want to learn about The story of Judith Fitzgerald, buy this book."
1,Why?,"I heard that Sarah personally asked her friends and fans and family not to have anything to do with this book. So why would any Sarah fans buy a book that is supposed to be about Sarah, yet ends up being about Fitzgerald, etc and this big tribute to dead stalker Uwe Vandrei? Beats me."
1,Trifling,"No color pix, most look like they're from the internet...nothing but a boring writer discussing boring quotes and bits of strung together old interviews...what does that have to do with Lilith Fair and Sarah? Absolutely nothing, imho. Sarah wouldn't give an interview for the book; that's the kinda book this is, and so, I wouldn't recommend it, especially since it's unauthorized and, well, sux. Buy that other book that's much more entertaining and much more real."
5,I tried to hate it but I loved it anyway,"I got Buidling a Mystery for Cristmas and really wanted to hate it. I even told my brother he was a goof for spending money on it but then after I started to read it my mom got upset because I was reading it under the table at Christmas dinner and my brother kept trying to ""borrow"" it back and then, my father was reading it because of course he is always hearing my Sarah c-d's and he said it was a good book even if he didn't know Sarah's music much and so, it's a really good book and tells the truth and that's three thumbs up from the Giardinis which equals five stars and that's why I liked it alot and its the first book I read from beginning to end this year. Oh, ya, the best parts about Uwe and his sister and makes you really wonder about what really happened to him and it's kinda scary and I don't think I'll write anymore fan letters to somebody because..."
4,freakin good book,"yes, kids, it's a freakin good book and if i had beleive all these revwiews i wouldnot have bought building a mystery. and, i wouldnot have come back here to tell fans of sarah who might not think this is a good book that is definately a good book and worth it to buy it because it is a freakin good book!!!!!!!!!"
5,Excellent!,"What a good book! What a good writer! I learned so much about Sarah, her adoption like me, her upbring, her history, her school, her family, her lovers, her friends, her bad habits, and her terrific talent and what makes her the terrific singer she is. The author writes with skill and knowledge. She's also very funny. I liked it a lot. Also, I'm glad to know Sarah chewed her nails just like me. ***She*** stopped though <sigh> ..."
1,Bad book,"I dont think this was a good book at all. I know it is unauthorzed, but I did not think it would be made up. I just wanted the scoop on the Lilith Fair and Sarah. I did not realise that I was going to get some bogus book filled with info. about her crazy stalker. This really was not a good book."
1,INSULTING,"This book is more than a waist of time - it is insulting! Not only to Sarah McLachlan but to anyone who is a fan of hers. It seems to me that Fitzgerald had to s-t-r-e-t-c-h every piece of (INSIGNIFICANT) minor detail about Sarah's life that she could find and misconstrue, elaborate, and lie about it! Implying that Sarah and her record co. are murder's is when I had to put this book down. If you want to waist time, money, and take up space with this book than buy it."
1,Piece of garbage!,"DO NOT, I repeat, DO NOT waste your time on this book as it is unauthorized. If you are a true fan of Sarah's do not give this lady a dime. Sarah and her adoptive parents wanted nothing to do with this book at all. The title of the book implies it talks about Lilith Fair but it doesnt. You are better off reading the Enquirer."
1,Yawn.....,"I did expect this book to have something to do with the Lilith Fair and Sarah Mclachlan. Mabe it was the title : The Story of Sarah McLachlan & Lilith Fair that confused me. This ""story"" is more about the author and her oppinions than McLachlan and the Lilith Fair. I waisted my time and money on this book -- Buy the authorized story From Lilith to Lilith Fair -- it is much more interesting and wont put you to sleep."
1,A Tabloid Kind Of a Book,All Fitzgerald seemed to do was take a bunch of magazine articles and a bunch of speculation about Sarah and her record co. being responcible for the death of a crazed stalker and put it to gether and call it a book. It is unfortunate that this book was even publishedl. It is written like one great big (super market) tabloid article. I had a hard time finishing it and was dissapointed that I wasted my money on this book. I wish I would have bought something else.
1,Dull & Borring,Save yourself some time and money -- and do what the author did -- go to YAHOO and type in Sarah McLachlan. You will get more information there than in this dull and borring book.
1,Manifesto of bias,"As a owner of one of the internet's most well respected Sarah McLachlan websites as well as an expert in Sarah McLachlan Biography, I find this book insulting. Building a Mystery reads like a schizophrenic patient's transcript strife with vague references, endless garble, and little substance. Having read the book front to back, I found little about 'Sarah McLachlan' and mostly what seemed to be an ongoing, unguided defamation. Not only does the author refuse to latch onto a journalistic perspective with direction and commentry from the people who matter most to the heart of the person and concept of 'Sarah McLachlan', she becomes attached to the alleged stalker which took his like soon after a legal battle with Mclachlan. I could not identify with her perspective or logic and found the book uncomfortable to read. It is no wonder Sarah McLachlan's family and record company wanted nothing to do with the author or this book. I strongly recommend against wasting your money."
1,Utter Crap,This book is the biggest piece of crap I've ever read - and I read a lot! How it ever got published is the real mystery! Don't waste your time on it.
1,Oh my God - someone write a real biography please !!!,"I bought this book and was mortified.Really mortified.The author may be a renowned poet but the subject of the book does not bear any relation to the title.I am an Australian and discovered the music of Sarah after ""Surfacing"" was released. I then bought every other album, joined Murmurs and also got the special releases. I actually got to see Sarah in concert in Sydney in 2004 when she was promoting ""Afterglow"".I am not one of the ""Sarahmaniacs"" so often quoted in other reviews - I am affected by her voice and the lyrics. There are other female artists who also affect me this way but none of them has had such dross written about them. This unauthorised biography is a credit to no-one.Do not buy it even if it is supposed to be updated. Use your favourite web search engine and learn more - for very little cost.Note : Amazon should allow a ""zero star"" rating."
1,Do not bother,Many of the facts in this book are wrong. Stay away from this poorly slapped together book as it will surely disappoint you.
2,from a devoted Fumbler :,"the book was very confusing to me at the beginning with Fitz driving driving down to Halifax in search of Sarah's birth mother. the whole part was unnecessary and a waste of paper if you ask me. other than that, i guess the book is an ok read. the writer does give interpretations of Sarah's lyrics and things like that. She also gives what the critics wrote about Sarah throughout her career so far."
1,Insulting,I found this book to be very insulting to Sarah McLachlan and her fans. This author tries her hardest to be unkind to just about everyone in this book who doesn't agree with her. She disparages anyone who doesn't share her opinions. The author also tried too hard to play connect the dots with whatever incomplete information she could find.
1,Maniacal ravings,"I have often wanted to throw books at their authors (and, in my capacity as a professional reviewer, often do). This particular book, aprime piece of puff-slut pukery masquerading as a literary biography, set the genre back a decade. After I'd gagged my way through the galleys, Itossed its grievous errors and calumnious omissions -- in regard to the life of a Canadian diva who deserves a well-wrought shrine, not a hack's maniacal ravings riddled with speciocities too egregious to enumerate here -- into the burning barrel and prayed Milton Acorn would turn over *again* in his grave. This book is a travestatious piece of crap."
1,No listing...,"I see what Sarah thinks of this book, since there's no listing of it in the Amazon Sarah Store. Really, you should take that as a clue to how well you'll like this book. Were this more than a collection of speculations and rumors, reprints and rehashed banality, it'd be worth the lives of the trees that were killed to make it. That doesn't happen to be the case here, so don't waste your energy on this low quality offering."
1,A Pity that I HAD to waist a whole star on it...,"Well, personally - and I think I speak for everyone, I think this book was just one long insult. Never have I read such complete crap. Half the stuff wasn't true, and the other half, well only God knows where she got that from. Come on - it isn't Sarah that she is interested in, it is Uwe. She wrote the Uwe biography, and so she thinks she knows everything about the people he stalked. HA!"
1,Made up?,"I feel like most of this book was made up as Fitzgerald went along. It's obvious that she didn't do any work while she was writing it. It was written in less than 5 months, so that she could get it out in time to catch the Lillith Fair wave and hang on. There's not much here to interest the long time fan, since you'll know most of what's here already, and new fans shouldn't be told lies like the ones that are in this book. Stay away unless you like throwing your money away..."
1,"Children, can you spell boring? I knew you could.","Hmmm...Let's see. This book is called Building A Mystery: The Story of Sarah McLachlan and Lilith Fair. Hmmm...Strange, then that the book should be 90% full of little tidbits, nuggets, and musings on Fitzgerald's life. Not only is there little new or real information about Sarah McLachlan, there's nearly nothing about Lilith Fair (only Fitzgerald's opinion about Lilith Fair).Not one word in the title is represented in the book. No one but Fitzgerald is building any mysteries (about an alleged stalker), and it's definitely not a story about Sarah McLachlan or Lilith Fair.Let's hope that someone else can come out with a book that has actual information in it, and a little less vain rambling."
1,It was a waste of time.,I read this book from cover to cover and did not like it. I read it in one day. The only reason I finished it was to see if anything good was in the book. It is a waste of good paper. I consider my self a Sarah McLachlan fan and really did not like the book. I also found out very little on Sarah McLachlan. I think that the book should not have had the first chapter in the book because it had no place in the book. Also part of the last chapter did not have a place in the book. I hope the new Sarah McLachlan book is better than this one.
1,Yuck,I'm glad I didn't have to pay for this book and got ahold of the people on the mailing list that were passing it around. What kind of writer gets all their information from internet newsgroups and mailing lists....a pitiful one. All information found in the book can be found on the web and in old magazine interviews.
1,Bland,"I didn't find the book very interesting. I read it thinking it would have a few good tidbids about Sarah, but all I got was Weekly World News style journalism.I would've been happy with any new info, but there wasn't even a new interview of Sarah in the entire book. If you're interested in the book, glance through it, but don't waste precious minutes of your life reading rehashed, tired old news.In short, I'd say skip it."
1,not worth the money,"This book is so warped. It reads like a highschooler's attempt at fiction... if only the author had some sort of FACTUAL BASIS behind her conjecture... but no. In this book we have what appears to be Ms Fitzgerald's jealous ramblings. I will have to admit that this is the first bio I've read where the author treats her subject with such disdain... it's rather suprising because it took me off-guard. I expected to learn about Sarah, not about Ms Fitzgerald and her unrealistic, ""gossipy"" blather."
1,Re-Defines how bad a book can be,"How then could this book be so intolerably bad? To begin with, it seems the writer wrote it with no other thoughts than what will bring in the 20 somethings. Open the book at random and start reading whatever is on the page, because no matter how hard you try, it's not interesting in any way. Finally give the editing job to your brother-in-law, because the meat packing plant just laid him off. He does have twenty years of cutting experience.This book now defines the basement for me. It is so bad, it isn't even good for being bad."
1,Full of outlandish conspiracy theories,This book is filled with outlandish conspiracy theories which lack common sense. It's clear that the author is more interested in writing a work of fiction than a factual biography. Everyone who turned down an interview with Fitzgerald had good reason to. This book is ample proof that the author has no respect for truth.
1,Don't believe the hype!,"One reason I didn't care for this book was the large amount of speculation that the author did. An author should never rely on speculation to pad out a book, but, unforunately, that's the case here. Where are the facts? What are the facts? All of the background biographical information about Sarah was easy enough to get. They can be found anywhere, in articles all over the place, which is the format that this author uses. She just repeats what other people have already written, but the trouble with that is, the author usually leaves out any part of the orignal articles that don't portray the Sarah McLachlan the author wants us to see. This author actually expects people to believe that Sarah McLachlan had an obsessed fan killed? I don't buy it, and neither should you!"
1,a great example of terrible writing,"Even if I ignore the shoddy and petty journalism of this book, which is hard to do, I'm appalled by how badly the book is written. Even a non-writer of her age would have enough command of the language to pen something more literate than this. And it's so obvious the fawning reviews are by JF herself, get a grip honey. As with many examples of biography this book says more about the author than the subject. For a great book on the nature of biography, read Janet Malcom's book on Sylvia Plath and Ted Hughes, not a biography of the pair but a brilliant analysis and evisceration of the ""art"" of biography."
1,Sadly lacking...,"This book was sadly lacking any positive qualities at all. Though this book was in no way well-written, or enjoyable to read, I did gain one thing from this journey into mediocrity: a name for it's author - untalented! take this book, take it down to the dumpster!"
1,"Don't be jealous, Judy","It's sad when aging no account poets who can't write real books have to come to a marketplace and champion their own book just to get their kicks. I found this book to be uncompelling, and horribly written. Rather than waste your time listening to people you don't know, give the book a whirl for yourself and see how inferior it is to other Lilith tomes."
1,"Honey, you are IN the bell jar","Jealousy (obsession): A talentless hack/ who don't know jack/ writes a bio/ lives in Ontario/ a divorced recluse/ who has no real use/ writes vapid trash/ lies about Sarah to get some cash/ you'd think she'd learn/ but can't stay away from the burn/ of the brilliant flame/ of Sarah's beauty, musical prowess, and fame."
1,Must Have Been Writer's Block.....,"Okay, Im not exactly the biggest die-hard Sarah fan, but I do love her music. However I dont think ANYONE deserves to be the subject of such, well, trash. It wasnt even the content that disturbed me so much (although a lot can be said for the authors interesting, um, ""theories"") but the book itself was inconclusive to say the least. If I wanted to do research on stalking maybe, or on Judith herself then this book is perfect. Otherwise, its misleading for the majority of people who are buying it to learn about Sarah's life. My take on this: buy it only if you want to take a crash course in how NOT to write a good biography."
1,False advertising...,"I almost died when I saw this so-called writer's name on a bunch of cruddish poems, gack! A somewhat misleading book pretending to be a serious biographical study of Sarah McLachlan's life and career (which is just a greedy grab for money, since, according to her website, the author is Uwe Vandrei's ""official biographer"", and obviously doesn't care about Sarah except for the cash she can bring in for the author). Like, what's the point of this book? Judging by the author's many problems making sense when she writes, I wouldn't recommend this book to anybody but my worst enemy (and then, only if I'm really desperate)."
1,Do not belive all the 5 star reviews,I have heard the rummer that Judith Fitzgerald has written a lot of the 5 star reviews before I even read it by someone else. Why else would there be so many? This book is REALLY BAD!! It is a waist of money and the writting style is TERRIBLE. It is so awful that it is annoying to read!! Do not waist your money on this book !!
1,not worth it,"I just got the book at Borders, i've only read the first 10 or so pages and i've hated it so far (which doesn't happen with me and books very often) so think twice before you buy it, or at least look it over first. this judith fitzgerald character is kinda bitchy in some of her writing, and even criticizes BAM at one point in the first chapter. definitely think twice before you part with 15 bucks for this one!"
1,Just say no.,"I flipped through the book the other day in the bookstore (so, yeah - I'm too cheap to actually buy it and since it IS unauthorized .... that gives me an excuse not to part with my $) Who is this author??? I have to say .... I absolutely hated her writing style. It was very jumbly and weird and .... bad."
2,"""Judith this is a sad way to make a dollar.""",My honest opinion I thought the book was improperly written. Especially the end where Judith lashes out on Sarah Mclachlan it's a shocker because in the beginning Judith seems to make herself out to be polite. Totally if your a Sarah fan like I am and you respect Sarah like I do dont buy the book more like ignore it. The ending is NOT nessecary it should be taken out than again this is my honest opinion. A Sarah Mclachlan FAN opinion. Judith this is a sad way to make a dollar
1,Even an update wouldn't help...,"If there's an update to this book, what I'd like to know is whether all the false information, mistakes, and baseless conjectures are going to be removed in favor of some real facts and quality writing... Are we going to see writing that an editor *HAS* touched instead of having half-witted banality foisted off on us? I doubt that will ever happen. No matter how hard Fitzgerald tries, this book will always be the same - an overly histrionic, misinformed, and misdirected mess."
3,It's a binder,"Works for the purpose, but kind of thin and flimsy. Would not hold up to heavy use at all. For a 3 inch binder, you would think that it would be more sturdy because it is really heavy when full."
4,does what its supposed to,"can't complain, it does everything a binder should do, a little over priced though. it is very sturdy so i cant complain"
5,paranormal,My wife and I love this show and could watch it over and over again. If you like this subject or this kind of thing it well worth the money.
3,No ghosts actually!,"I think most people who buy paranormal videos expect to see some ghosts. However, there is no ghost in Paranormal State. What you can see are human beings - some kids hunting for ghosts. So if you buy this for you want to see some ghosts, demons, etc., then save you money for something else like ""A Haunting"" or ""Unsolved Mysteries - Ghosts."" Oct, 2009I follow up my review made months ago (the above paragraph). I would suggest the production team add an ""re-enactment"" section to the original version, such that the viewers will be able to appreciate the horror feelings of seeing a ghost. - Feb. 26, 2010"
1,Good Show,"This is a great show, been trying to buy episodes & seasons but are very hard to buy and have delivered to the other side of the world. Thought I'd actually get to purchase it as it was in video format. You'd think they'd want customers and their money, this website is becoming a joke!"
3,"Good series, but DVD not closed-captioned","I caught a few episodes of Season 2 of Paranormal State and enjoyed it enough to purchase the Season 1 DVD. However, I am deaf, and while the TV series is closed-captioned, the DVD isn't. What the....? Extremely disappointed with whomever made that decision. I like the series because they don't pretend to ""know it all"" (they do research and learn more as they go along), they do seem to want to help the people involved(even though the people have to pay attention and want to help themselves first), and it deals with people and their situations, not empty haunted buildings. Also, if Lorraine Warren is willing to work with these folks, that gives them credibility as far as I'm concerned. Amityville was not a hoax. Do your research. And read the Warren's book."
5,The commentary is the best part,"I like this set a lot. The best part is the commentary, which I think shows Ryan and his crew as much more detailed, balanced, realistic and less dramatic than the 30 minute A&E; editing suggests some times. The commentary answers a lot of concerns some other reviewers have. The shows ought to be 60 or 90 minutes.I would detract a half point for the shows not being closed-captioned. I have to turn the sound way up for me too."
2,Chip Coffey,"I do not believe him and never have, just looks phony to me. I think the boy is funny too if you ask me!Program good not sure!"
3,Nice ghost stories,"I like a good ghost story but this show is nothing but a story to me. I only watch it to see just how silly it gets. I do not believe in ghosts, psychics or anything like that. They had a haunted piano, a box to talk to the dead, horny ghosts, holy metals and for goodness sake puckwudgies? I can hardly believe they expect us to take this stuff as real. Oh well, I give it three stars because it's good for a few laughs anyway."
3,Good Season,The first season the characters on the show are new and not as developed so understanding their roles along with the specifics on the case can be distracting. Overall they are interesting and I would recommend anyone to take a look!
3,Paranormal State Season 1 DVD collection,"Good show! This DVD eliminates the commercial interruptions so that is a plus. Only bad thing is that it is not closed captioned, which I need in order to watch it without having the volume up high. Why are all my favorite shows on DVD (Paranormal State, Ghost Hunters) not closed captioned? They are when shown on TV! Otherwise it is a great DVD if you don't need the captions."
4,"Pretty good show, if you like this sort of thing:)","I saw this first on TV and have to admit I really like it. I have a friend that does this stuff and took me with her once, it is pretty interesting. We got a whole lot of nothing that particular night, but I certainly won't base my beliefs on that, the spirit world does not perform on cue and isn't at our beckon call. These kids have a method, they follow it every time, and they seem to get results, so it's well worth a look. I'm just happy they don't see the need for a growling, spitting, snarling ""psychic"" pretending to be possessed like the UK equivalent of this show has. I'd buy it again, it's worth seeing regardless of your beliefs - you never know ;)."
3,Home remedies for gardeners,"I was really interested in the topic as I read a lot of things on the internet regarding gardening and green living and it is hard to know what has been researched, and what works. This was pretty good source. I think I would have done well to get it from the library as I learned what things I could use and then I was done with the book."
2,"OK, I get it",child-like. limited. Honest but good information. I would not buy this book if selecting at a book store. Summary? Go on & responsibly use chemical applications in the garden/house. The alternatives have limited success.
5,Fabulous book that every gardener should read,"This book debunks many myths and updates old scientific methods of gardening with new studies that show many of the things we were taught are wrong. I am a very experienced gardener who loves to read gardening books and magazines and some of the studies really surprised me. This is a great book and one that I am using for ""thank you"" gifts for anyone that I knows is a gardener."
1,Commerically Minded,"I was very disappointed with this book. I'm an organic gardener and was expecting some alternative recipes and ideas for pest control, fertiliers, ect. The author proved most home garden remedies were unstable, worked only marginally, or were not convienent. Basically, his answer to everything was just buy some commerical product. This book exposes some ""old wife's tale"" garden remedies as dangerous or ineffective which is useful, but offers no alternatives or improvements and that would have been even more useful."
3,Not a solo reference,This book does a good job of responding to myths about gardening but is not a good single reference. I was looking for something I could go to as a staring point and get the truth.
1,Can't believe what I've read...,"I purchased this book because it came as a package deal with other Amazon books that I purchased (you know, the whole free shipping thing).I checked the index and browsed a couple of topics that I have personal experience with and couldn't believe what I was reading. This book is so far off base on so many subjects I can't begin to describe. If you're new to gardening or even an old pro, don't waste your $$$.I know that there are many ways to achieve the same results with gardening, and while some of his statements may hold truth; the general manner in which he dismisses so many proven techniques leads the reader to doubt most of his writing."
1,These aren't real snowblades,"These are fo-snowbladeswhich will make you look even stupider than snowbladingi snowblade and i love itbutget the ones with non-release bindings and leashes, not with ski bindings and ski-brakes....if your gonna snowblade do it the RIGHT way"
1,sugar-coated & adolescent,"I WAS HAD. Not only do I love world-music, but I have a world-music/jazz show on the college's radio station--playing Fela, Nusrat, Sharrock, Chandra, Zorn. After hearing one review on the radio, I bought ""Sing or Die"" without listening to it, but it's merely a bad imitation of US pop music that has no flare, no imagination, no musical ability--NOTHING of interest. Spice Girls have more going on musically & intellectually!"
2,A little disappointment,"Believe me, I have been a great fan of DCT, but this one was a little bit of a disappointment. I've also heard the Japanese version and all the songs were great, in Japanese. It's just that in this English version, it sounds too foreign and unnatural, perhaps because translating every single word does not always work and sounds too awkward. It doesn't seem to blend into other American pops."
2,Seriously?,"This album is not very good at all. This is when Loc and Richter really turned to the lil john mainstream side. Just listen to drunk in da club. People say they stepped up in this album and i completely disagree. All it is is big talk and bad rhymes. There's no talent required for what the kings have done here. Everything sounds rushed. The songs aren't even very long and most of the choruses aren't good rhymes, and some of them aren't rhymes at all. If you like mainstream rap like lil john or just big talk that doesn't take any skill to create, then listen to this cd. Otherwise listen to KmK's High Society."
1,Modernist Heresy Disguised as Catholicism.................,"This book is an excellent illustration of why the post-Vatican II Catholic Church is in such sorry shape.The book is a well-constructed arrangement of religious syncretism and relativismtowards truth masquerading as Catholicism. The author has no cluewhat it means to be Catholic.His idea of Catholicism maintains anexternal Catholic appearance, while crossing and conciliating it with heretical Protestantism,theological relativism, and Marxist demagoguery. The official Church teachings are presented in thesame way and with no more validity than the views of heretical and dissident ""theologians"".All of this is cleverly done in a ""shades of gray"" style in anas to endeavor to leave the reader questioning and doubting all that he or she has ever been taughtregarding the Catholic Faith, and indeed whether absolute truthexists at all................."
2,Skip this one.,I would not recommend this book to anyone who does not already have a strong catechetical background. There are a lot of basic facts in the book that are in error. I think the material is above what the author can grasp. I would put this on your do not read list until you have a sounder understanding of Vatican II and Lumen Gentuim. I would not recomend this book
3,There is probably a better wireless out there,"This wireless controller works, but the thumb stick is not as tight as the ""S"" controller that comes with Xbox. Another major drawback for me is that the Xbox live headset doesn't plug into this controller. It plugs in to the xmitter which is several feet away on the Xbox. So where is the benefit of being wireless?"
2,Poor quality,"In addition to the looseness of the joystick mentioned, I had a joystick fail after minimal usage. Not a very robust controller."
1,COPPER COLORED!,I will not recommend to use this for cooking. Copper colored metal smells bad when you heat it up. I tried several times to heat it up to see if the smell will go away. There is no way we should put food and cook it or eat it after.
5,Great for veggies,"We have used this to grill asparagus and squash rounds. I usually skewer these things, but loved them off the grid. Veggies still got that yummy ""been grilled"" taste, and husband said the grid held heat well. Easily cleaned. It's made surprisingly well."
4,Not as good as it could have been,"The computer simulations of NYC etc in 100 years after people are interesting, even if the buildings falling remind you of the WTC on 9/11. The speculation is about what it would like if people disappeared, a very pleasant thought, indeed. Evidently, house cats would take over, the film posits."
3,"Interesting, but simplistic.","They could have done a far better job with this. The graphics are terrific, and it is thought-provoking, but, really, how many times do you need to see the Seattle Space Needle or the Eiffel Tower fall over in slow motion?Their timeline seems pretty arbitrary and does not tally with what I've read elsewhere.SUMMARY: It's fun and interesting, but take it with a grain of salt.For a much better treatment of the subject, try the excellent (although depressing) book by Allen Weisman,The World Without Us.)"
2,basically about corrosion,"I had high hopes for this video but in the end it was essentially all about how the lack of maintenance will affect the corrosion and decay of various types of structures - concrete, steel, etc. etc. I guess the feel was less apocalyptic than I had hoped. In defense I suppose this would have come off as too political if the film dealt more directly with long term environmental impacts from a scientific peerspective. They did visit a town abandoned in the aftermath of Chernobyl and talked about the dogs and cats (avoided discussion of what domestication does to plants and animals), but the film would have had more impact if it dealt with these issues."
3,"Great video, but picture is windowboxed","I don't know if it was just me who got a bad dvd, but the picture is windowboxed (black bars on all sides of the picture). This forces me to use the zoom feature on the television to eliminate the black bars, however the picture quality becomes grainy. It is a great dvd and I hope that I am the only one who is experiencing this problem."
5,Life After People...,"As the title suggests, this documentary isn't about HOW we leave (though there are bonus features suggesting possible scenarios for our disappearance) but HOW life continues. I didn't find the movie depressing or eerie...I found it both amazing and heartening that should our interferring and encroaching stop, things will continue quite nicely...OK, with the possible exception of some specifically bred brachycephalic canines who won't fare so well...but, then again...that's OUR doing...not nature's doing. This movie was well thought out and well supported in it's content by interviews with engineers, ecologists, biologists, et al. This is one great work!!"
2,Not as good as it could be,"This program is made for television/ short-attention span piece of work. It is more formatted around time for commercials than for its overall flow as a documentary.I ordered it after reading the book ""The World Without Us"" by Alan Weisman. I was hoping for commentary by Alan Weisman but there was none. I feel like he did much better job in his work on an analysis of this scenario.This effort by the history channel seems more like a Johnny-come-lately in comparison to Weisman's work and I was disappointed."
4,Depressing yet engrossing,"This is a fascinating video and well worth watching, but I don't know what depresses me more about ""Life After People"" -- to think that all of mankind's achievements and knowledge may one day be lost forever or the almost gleeful way the people involved in the story imply that it's all right if we disappear because at least the cockroaches will survive, and hey, we didn't deserve to be here anyway. Also missing were any suggestions for averting a complete loss of our knowledge, such as improved recording media, possible changes in the way we build things, etc. Sorry, human race, but so long, goodbye and good riddance!"
5,Fascinating documentary,"This is an imaginative documentary on what might happen to all we have created if people simply disappeared. This is a not an environmentalist video - it doesn't advocate people dying off nor does it explain why we vanish - it is more from the engineering/biological standpoint: what would happen to world famous landmarks if they were abandoned, how would domestic animal adapt (or not), what would happen to animal pests we fight off now? For the armchair engineer/biologist, it is imaginative and fascinating. Combines the talent of leading structural specialists, biologists, and convincing CGI optical effects from Industrial Light and Magic."
5,very interesting and entertaining,"the life after people series is like watching a car accident, you can't take your eyes off it. it has a lot of really good CGI in it but the story and narration is outstanding. i loved watching this and seeing what may or will happen to our planet if we were to suddenly disappear. i think this would be a great addition to ones movie collection."
4,"a few cheesy graphics aside, it's good stuff","There is just something fascinating about death and decay, about the inevitable entropic decline that affects everything in the end. This show gives us an idea of what such a world would look like and what it would become in the absence of human beings. There are some great renditions of cars and buildings and bridges collapsing in time, while the animals and plants take over and adapt to a new environment without humans or fences or zoos.There are a few cheesy graphics that are distracting and silly. Otherwise, it is intriguing to consider the scenarios."
3,Underrated Disney Horse Fare,"A group of riding students (Tommy Kirk and Annette Funicello among them) must contend with unruly horses and a taciturn instructor (Donald Pleasance), all while trying to master the finer points of jumping, dressage, and sportsmanship. Not a great movie, but doesn't deserve to be forgotten. Based on a novel by Don Stanford.Staci Layne Wilson"
4,The Horsemasters,I received the product in a timely manner. Product was in the condition described in ad. I would do business with them again.
3,Not the right size,We have used a RSVP strainers in one of our two kitchen sinks and liked how easy they were to clean. We mistakenly purchase this two-in-a-package offer thinking the larger one was for kitchen sinks.... it's not. It's a medium size strainer. We now use it in the utility sink. The smaller one is fairly useless since it drains so slowly... we couldn't find a good use for it.
3,Down the drain,"The product material is great. The only problem, the second size drain does not fit any of my sinks, bathtub, stationary tubs, etc. So when buying a package of two, only one fits my needs. Description did not mention the two sizes."
2,Sink strainers,These strainers have a very small strainer capacity. They were not what I expected and were not appropriate for using in our sinks. We returned them and Amazon took care of the transaction to our satisfaction.
3,drain strainer!!,The sizes should be listed. One of the strainers did not fit. It was the smaller one which I neede. It's of good quality but I can't use it.
1,"Close, but not good enough.","I thought I was going to love these - replacing my mesh rusty ones for thse pretty stainless steel ones.First, I thought I was getting 2 large strainers - no where does it say that there would be one large and one small... you have to look real close at the picture to see one is smaller.The other thing is, once they are in your sink, you can't get them out. I have to jimmy each one out with a knife, so inevitably the stuff in the strainer gets flipped down the drain anyway.Very frustrating."
4,Very Good Quality,I like this metal strainer much better than the plastic ones. The smaller strainer fits perfectly in our bathtub drain. Since it sits down in the drain opening it does not move around. Catches all the hair that would have gove down the drain when someone washes their hair.
2,halter strap broke,"I was very excited about receiving this light weight, nifty binoc.Aside from the shape of the binoc which is very managable and easy to use, the container frame it is packaged in..is a bit difficult to load binoc in & out of. In fact, the halter strap broke as I was sliding it in. I was very disappointed as now, I have a very expensive binoc with a broken strap which would have to go back to manufacturer for repair. The actual visual on this is OK, but nothing earth shattering."
2,Disappointed,"I was looking forward to this book, as my family has gone through several severe illnesses, including Guillane-Barre. I was very disappointed in both her writing (I found it hard to follow at times) and in her attitude (towards her family and health care providers). She was in the hospital for 5 days and seemed to yell at someone at least once a day; my husband was in for 3 months and, albeit justifiably stressed at times, was pleasant and thankful to his caregivers. It is rare that I do not finish a book once I've started it; this one was not worth my time."
2,A nice cataloge of modern museums....,"this book introduces a nice and a big photos for the most popular museums around the world, if you are searching for a data to make a research or something like that, it won't be helpful, but it covers all drawings and photos for the museums listed besides a brief description...."
2,You get what you pay for,"I purchased this as a gift for the holidays. I have seen this in catalogues as well as internet stores. It looked well done.When I opened the package I realized that it was constructed of plastic not metal, Which is not what I expected......I know it's buyer beware when you purchase somthing without a complete description of the product. If it's not welcomed when opened this holiday I will gladly return it with complete understanding."
1,never recieved,I received the wrong package and returned it. I am still awaiting a exchange or a refund.
2,Lucky this battery has great warranty....,"Installed ORB78DT-84 battery in a Lotus M100 last June and it worked through last year's Lotus driving season. It overwintered in a heated garage on a high-tech trickle charger. And it failed this summer, unable to hold a charge and even leaking during charge (also high-tech with shutoff). Not impressive for the money."
5,Excellent Batteries,Was having problem with the battery in our 2007 mazda 3 put this thing in and havent had problems since. Starts great in the cold live in colorado and can get pretty cold in the winter but this puppy fires our car right up.
3,Not Bad...,"...but not great either. It does bring back memories of my high school years. Not always a good thing. These are songs you know. They are fun to hear again, and will draw a smile out of you when you do."
2,When Black Isn't Black,"Wilson F1455 NFL All Pro Game Football (Official Size)I ordered this as a gift for my grandson along with an additional and larger ball, since his hands are growing! The Wilson All Pro Game Football he received was not BLACK but the regular pigskin color! I was VERY disappointed they sent the wrong ball and so was he."
1,not Department 56,I am aware of the difference between the Dept 56 reindeers which were produced prior to 2006 and the new Patience Brewsters reindeers which are being produced NOW. I specifically ordered these from you because you stated they were Dept 56 and I am trying to complete my set of DEPT 56 Krinkles Reindeers. Your advertising is very misleading and I was disappointed to receive the newly distributed reindeers. There are slight differences other than the boxes and I am trying to complete an ORIGINAL DEPT 56 COLLECTION...that is why I purchased these from you. I expect that you will correct this situation so that I don't have to contact Amazon and point out your misleading advertising...as there is a difference!!I look forward to a quick resolution.
3,Does the job for now...,"Low quality leather is not supple enough and doesn't fit all the way around my steering wheel (when I grasp the wheel my fingers touch the edge of the cover). But combined with the mesh inserts, it does give me a better grip than not using any cover at all."
1,Waste of Money...,"Dont buy it. There's actually some nicer products from companies like Belkin that act as both a fashionable dock and a USB hub... Apple should only charge $9.99 for this piece of plastic, or include it with iPods."
4,ipod dock,"It may not be as complex as those high priced docks , but it does have audio and video out.Downside is it wont work with shuffles or any other mp3 players .So if you have a classic , nano or touch , it should be ok."
3,beware of the lower cost ones,"This is an official apple dock, but the ones that are selling for half price (I got mine via hotdealz, $21) are outdated models that don't include the IR port on the front, which means it will not work with the remote control (which was extra anyway). This model Does have s-video out, which newer models don't have. So if you need the ability to control remotely, and/or s-video out, check with the vendor before you order."
1,"A piece of JUNK!!!!!!, and the sellers are not honest","The guys who sales this product are no honest, no box , no adaptors no cable just the cradle in a paper back.The item itself was dirty.After I post a negative feedback, they sent me a lot of e-mails where they said if I remove it, they will satisfy me in some way.I did so and I asked them for an adaptor for the Ipdo video.Im waiting for their response yet!!!!!!, no answer off any kind for my multiple e-mails nor the adaptor.I thing this guys sell junk and try for any mean to get a positive feedback.thanks"
4,An okay Top Country single...,"...but wait'll you hear the whole album! Lane Turner's one of those deep-voiced hard-country crooners who bring to mind old Merle Haggard, early John Anderson and Brad Paisley's best... Nice to hear someong making real country music again!"
4,VALUE AND SOUND,"Well made guitar with average projection. When paired with Elixir phosphur/bronze it comes alive. Alive enough to be miked as a back-up guitar on real honest to God gigs.You can't go wrong with this purchase no matter how you look at it. I own Taylor, Gibson, Fender, Gretsch.Doc"
1,Wrong setting...,This book should have been set at a pier or wharf instead of a cafe because the majority of it is a boatload of cr*p.
5,A Must Read for Everyone,"This is a great book. Boy will it get you to thinking about your own life... in ways that you never thought you would. It is easy to read, face pace and packed with enlightment. Highly recommended to all."
5,This is the one must to share.,"I really liked the structure of the story. The book ran the main character with reader naturally and the simple exaple using in the story inspire reader. The simple does not necessarily mean that it will be easy, but it will address you to have some new idea, thought, and new yourself. I really recommend to read this book for any type of reader. Wether it is true or not, just take a look and unlock the unfullfilled life."
4,A very nice book,"When an accident on the highway makes John take an alternate route to where he wants to go he soon finds himself lost, hungry, and almost out of gas. Thinking he will have to sleep in his car before walking he comes across a small cafe in the middle of nowhere. He goes in to get some food and when he looks at the menu he finds 3 questions to ponder while waiting for his food: Why are you here? Do you fear death? Are you fulfilled? With the help of the people in the cafe John learns a different way to look on life, and more importantly himself.I liked this book. It certainly gives you something to think about. I would recommend this book."
3,Simple. Very Simple. Yet Great Questions To Ask.,"The Why Cafe: A very simple book. Easy read. And yet, some powerful questions to ponder about. Why are you here? Do you fear death? Are you fulfilled? The book goes in, in a form of a story, to show that why doesn't need to wait for ""retirement"" to do what they love, their Purpose For Existence. If you do it now, you will realize that you don't need much stuff to make you fulfilled (and perhaps you can get paid to do what you love) and then you don't need to fear death cuz' you fear it only when you are not doing what you love. And a lot more questions to ponder. Simple book. Actually a bestseller. (Finished it in one sitting).I felt it was a bit simple and perhaps it is because I read so much of the like of Tony Robbins and such. But for those starting this journey of ""why am I here?"" and ""now what?"", this may be a great start-up."
1,Poor Quality,"Simply an example of poor workmanship. Within two uses the glass for the scope fell out (not broke), the clip was cracked, and tactical light wouldn't screw on. Unfortunately, I bought it for a christmas gift and it was in storage for 30+ days, so no refund, even when I complaned vehemenently about it being only used twice. I won't buy another thing from this store.What's worse, I bought another gun for my other child and it had similar, but different, quality problems so it can't be just the act of use by a rough child. Absolute garbage!"
2,be carefull,"i got the same disc and put it in my xbox. now i get the xbox needs service screen with no error code. i was not verry happy and neither was my husband. so just out of curiosity my husband put a game in and it loaded with no problem. my xbox was also modded, so i would not advise any one to use it on a modded xbox."
1,This is complete garbage.,This is complete garbage. Made by a bunch of After Effects monkeys. I advice is to please involve a creative person next time.
5,Life...,This is a superb vide which offers much insight with a simple dialogue. Educational and inspirational if you are lucky enough to catch few hints of consciousness he has to offer. Bravo.
1,A gift,"I donated this as a gift i am not impressed with his work and find his voice to be boring, will not purchased anymore of his work, first time i ever did and last!"
3,"Impossible to Fit on 15.5"" Wheel","Good quality cover for the price but the size is misleading 14.5-15.5"". My wheel is exactly 15.5"" and after much struggling, I gave up trying to put it on. Now looking for a bigger cover."
2,Not for all steering wheels,We have a 2005 Toyota Prius. These covers did not fit as snuggly as we would have liked. We gave them to a friend and purchased one from Wal-Mart that was of better quality and provided a better fit.
2,Not for the beginner!,"I was sent this book by my book club by mistake (waited too long and had to buy it.)... I started to read it and realized that it didn't start at the basics like I needed. HOWEVER after going through the wrox book ""Begining JavaScript"" and then picking this book back up I did learn a few different aspects of JavaScript that were not covered by the Wrox book. The book does bring to light a few different perspectives that might help somebody with certain programming needs, but that's about it. I am not knocking this book it does have it's place. Final thought is figure out what you need and if other books don't deliver this one might :)"
1,Disappointed,"""Pop up windows using JavaScript"" would be a more accurate title. I learned more from online tutorials than this book delivered."
2,"I don't really know, but I don't think so.","I never really finished this book, I guess it tells you the basic things, I went from the cover to the end, and it really didn't help me out. I got it to learn specific things, new to ""JavaScript 1.5"" but it didn't tell me either. IE: scrollbar colors, and windows and yada yada. I don't know if it covers all it should, thanks. But if you're a beginner it's okay, I think.*alex"
2,Very Disappointed,"I bought this book to find out how to print variables from a javascript to a web page. Sounds simple, right? Sounds like page #1, right? Not only does this book never tell you how to do this simple and very basic operation, it pretends that no such thing could ever be expected from a book on scripting! It tells you how to print variable to popup widows and that's it. It pretends that this is all the output any person using JavaScript would or should ever need. They never address output to the web page itself. Never even mention it. Not once. That's just what I need to do with my arrays, print them to a popup alert window. I would have appreciated at least a small message as to *why* they don't tell you about such simple and basic stuff. This book is really pretty bad. I suggest you try another one on JavaScripting. It's bad, and it's disingenous."
5,The best case you can have for your DS lite!,"I just got the Metallic Rose DS Lite and was trying to find a case with the best protection but not covering the beautiful color of my DS Lite. I searched on Youtube and found an unboxing video of armor lite case and I decided to get it. The case is in nice quality, not something cheap plastic that easily scratches. The installation is easy, just push the DS into the bottom and then close both DS and the case, push a little bit to fit everything together. You may want to clean your DS with Dust-off before you install. It fits well to the console. I have been playing, opening and closing for a day and did not observed any gaps or loosing parts between the case and the console.One thing is that when you close the case, your console has an ~1 mm gap in between. You can try to use sand paper to make it close more. This is the only small thing that I don't like about this product, but it doesn't hurt."
2,It's ok but not nearly as good as the Nerf Armor,"I have both this one and the Nerf Armor. This one is just a clear, plastic case that protects a little but I think it would crack if dropped far. The Nerf brand one is much better; it costs like $10 more but it's worth the price difference."
4,Armor Lite,"I first got the instinct to purchase one of these after seeing how others were able to customize their DS's with skins in between the case and DS. When my order arrived, it was exceptional. I was able to make and use skins. The casing works just as it should. Although as others have stated it does not let the DS get closed all the way and removing the casing I found extremely difficult since it was such a snug fit. I kept feeling like it was going to crack on me. It is good that the hinges are detachable I suppose to aid in removal of it. Other than that, this product is great. I have my custom skins and a nice shiny casing."
3,Worx replacement line,This line is for fairly light work. Tends to stick to itself or thereby preventing proper automatic line feed. You have to remove the spool and unravel it periodically.
1,The Spools Break Easily,"These spools crack and break very easily. The top breaks, then the plastic thread gets caught as it turns. The product line is great, but the plastic spool, and the plastic housing is terrible. Now I have a product that is excellent except for the line; but isn't that what makes this product?I'd give it a 1 on a scale of 1 to 5 with 5 being the best....To bad, it's light weight, but junk!"
1,Amazon's over efficiancy/ under availability,"Got the line spools and then later was informed that the battery powered trimmer is not available until next year. What am I supposed to do with the line? Almost too much trouble to return it. Lately there have been several items ordered through Amazon that later turned out to be unavailable. They seem good for books and music, but other items are questionable."
2,Worx wa0004 0.065 inch 10-foot replacement line spool 2 Pack,"These are very expensive when purchasing from Amazon. If you bought the machine from Home Depot you get a lifetime supply of the replacement lines for free. Now that I bought the machine from Amazon, I'm stuck buying all the replacement spools at the inflated price here."
1,Don't waste your money,Don't waste your money on this or any WORX products. I made that mistake and all I got was something I ended up needing to throw away in three months.
2,short spools,"I ordered two double packs, 60 feet total....I got 4 spools of 10 feet eachThe invoice also lists the spools at 15 feet each. Time for Amazon to discontinue this sellers item"
3,spool for wg150,"The line is good, but I was only sent 10' of line instead of the 15' line that was ordered."
2,more cord please,10 foot...seriously...go to the depot and re wrap them yourself.store bought line seems to me to be more sturdy.apparently I cant count to 20....try again
5,Prompt & Fair Price for Product (Worx Trimmer Line),Gentlemen: Living in a fairly small town its a great help to be able to access the internet to find and purchase items not found locally. It provides the help consumers need to replace items hard to find here. I appreciate Amazon.com for finding firms who are able to fill the requirement we the consumers are needing. Thank you W. Martinez
5,Worx replacement line spool,This replacement line spool is just like the original line spool. It was easy to install and lasts just as long.
5,Excellent line,Why bother trying to wind string from a bulk supply when I can get the original product set to go flawlessly. Very happy with quality as well.
4,Not too shabby,"Before I purchased this spare spool, I read several horror stories about how quickly it ran out. Fortunately I also read a review that flatly stated that if the directions are followed, its life was more than adequate. I got about 8 hours use out of my original spool...thats about 4 trips around my yard and sidewalks. Sure beats anything I've ever purchased at a big box store!"
2,Dissaointing,"Product looks good on TV, but is very light duty. Does not cut as good as you see on TV. Light duty work on a small yard only."
4,Worx Line spool,"This string really cuts. The trimmer is low power, and this string helps quite a bit. Expensive to order two at a time."
4,Good Product,"Good quality product. It came on time. The only thing wrong was that the box was very ""beat up"". No problems w/ the product, though..."
3,Worx Replacement Spool,Purchased since it was a suggested item as usually being purchased together by other customers. Only to later find out Worx gives free spool for life just pay Shipping and Handling. They send you 6 spools for around $8. :( Not a deal since I paid about $7 for 2.
3,Get your free spool in eBay,"They have Worx store in eBay. You can get 6 pack ""free spool for life"" promo for $6.11. It doesn't matter where you purchase your Worx GT from. eBay seller name is WorxGT."
5,Worx WA0004 0.065-Inch 10-Foot Replacement Line Spool,"I ordered 2 of these on separate orders, but have still only received one of them. I have paid for both. The first order I was notified by you as lost in the mail, so I reordered. Part of my first order was received, and all of the second order. I have paid for both entire orders. Please send the Worx weedeater string that is still due me."
2,extra,This item is much more expensive than it should be. This item is a free item from workx you just pay shipping and get 6 for about $8
5,finger saver,Works great.Saves your fingernail if you have to open lots of cans. Every busy bartender should use one (or more).
1,Useless plastic gadget,"Looking for a can opener? Please DO NOT buy this item. I tried it on 3 cans, and it consistently failed to open the cans - it just broke the tab pull"
2,Authenticity Matters,"Sacred Spirit is produced in the Netherlands by Claus Zundel, a German, who has taken the name The Fearsome Brave. Let the buyer beware of the centuries-old practice of ripping off American Indians for profit. There is an indigenous people in Norway called the Sami. One of their forms of cultural expression is the yoik, a type of chant. John Trygve Solbakk has, on behalf of the copyright group Sámi kopiija, made a claim regarding two Sami yoiks which they maintain were stolen by Virgin Records and presented as American Indian songs and dances. According to Solbakk and the Sami people he represents, the well known Sami yoik ""Normo Jovnna"" has been listed on the CD as ""The Counterclockwise Circle Dance."" So, while this piece is beautiful and is certainly comes from a very old tradition, it is very likely European, not Native American."
3,Sacred Spirit CD - original,"I like ""Sacred Spirit 2"" better than this original CD. If I could do it over again, I would only purchase the second volume and not this first one. The music and chants of the second CD are more soothing, dramatic and better integrated than in the original."
5,Originalmente Nativo,"Gracias a este CD la gente podrá apreciar y conocer mejor la música de los indios americanos, los auténticos americanos,. Probablemente algunos sectores más puristas se opondrán a este producto, pueden decir que no es original, que deforma el verdadero espíritu de los cantos tradicionales, añadiendo cambios significativos como sintetizadores, etc, pero a fin de cuentas, ¿nos queda algo original y verdadero, en este estresado y gastado siglo XXI?. Humildemente opino que estas comunidades de indígenas vivían en paz con la naturaleza y consigo mismos, los admiro profundamente y creo en su modelo de vida y es una pena que los exterminaran. Por eso me encanta este producto, lo creo acertado y muy original, porque nos ha hecho redescubrir culturas ya muy lejanas.Lástima que solo lo pueden apreciar unas minorías concretas."
5,the most beautiful music,"When i heared Sacred Spirit music i felt something strange inside me...This fealing was so strong, i can't explane what it was...But it bringed me to life...This music is so special to me, it's no words to say...Sacred spirit is part of my life:)"
2,*****five stars not two/could not change stars,Five stars......started my interest in this type of music Number one and two are the best i wanted to edit my star rating incorrect ***** stars
5,Connect with the Primal,Cannot stop playing the cd (minimum of 4 times daily); gets me gorunded and keeps the creative streams going; both tranquil and an energy boost at the same time. Just bought the second volume and can't wait to hear it!
5,Another Rebuy,"I've had Sacred Spirits I and the original Deep Forest CD stolen twice. This is my third time buying this CD and Deep Forest--a mark of a great CD. I still have the Sacred Spirits II CD. I love Sacred Spirits I & II because they capture some of the sounds I heard visiting Cherokee City, North Carolina, while blending string, acoustic, and electric. I also recommend Coyote Oldman's ""In Beauty I Walk"" if you want Native American wind instruments blended with electronic."
2,This is not very good at all - way too electronic.,"Native American chants dubbed over cheesy electronic music. Not very well produced at all. This CD -Native Heart: The Spirit of the North American Indianis a hundred times better. I've been to several inter-tribal pow-wow's and native singing is extremely powerful and deeply moving. This CD, with it's electronic bubble gum pop is a disgrace.This has been on my wish list for a long time, and I just found it at my public library yesterday. I am so glad I didn't buy it."
3,I was hoping for more,"I found this CD to not be as good as I expected, but it is okay. I just wish there were more drums in the sound. But it's still nice."
5,Sacred Spirit(s)...New Packaging But Still Great CD!!!!,"Got this CD for a friend just recently. The original CD I own was called Sacred Spirits by Virgin in 1994. Outside packaging, front and back cover is different but songs still all the same....except English version of song title listed first on new CD (vs. American Indian version listed first on my old CD).This is one of my top 5 CD's.......was very popular on Musical Starstream years ago and it got me hooked. Explore your own native vibes by listening to Sacred Spirits.Deb"
5,Sacred Spirit,"It's great to hear an album like this, there is only original native american singing and chanting, with keyboards, drums and percussions in the backgrounds, and no samples!Where the soundtrack to 'Pocahontas' dissapointed me, when 'Steady As The Beating Drum' was the only song performed alone by Pocahontas' tribe, I loved this album right from the beginning, and even many radio channels plays the most famous (And commercial) song 'Yeah Noha' sometimes.On my skiing vacation with my friends in 1998, I heard this album again, and it was an amazing experience to both hear the music, and watch the snow covered norweigan landscapes at the same time, and especially the first five songs are outstanding.It's hard to find a group like Scared Spirit in this new millenium."
5,A great choice for your collection!,"I love this CD. It grabs you from the 1st note to the very end. Sacred Spirit:Chants And Dances Of The Native Americans, will take your spirit for a ride! I'm listening to it now and can't be still or stop singing with the artists. It's that great you'll want to hear it over and over again. It's great for your heart and soul!"
5,"Hauntingly moving, bringing visions of high plain vistas.","Such a creative blend of American Native and chamber music string instrument arrangements--especially the accompanying cello. This CD reliably brings me to a ""communing with nature"" mind set. I have listened to it rafting rivers, hiking, running, biking and just gazing out my living room windows--it inevitably brings me to a meditative state of mind. It is so deeply moving, very emotional. I have tried to find one its equal for variety but have found none to compare! Any suggestions?"
4,The fake is just as beatiful...,"Some of this music I do recognize as Sami (Scandinavian Native) and not American Native singing. Of, course that does not affect the fact that it is well composed, relaxing and harmonic music."
3,Pleasant and peaceful!,I heard the Sacred Spirit II in Yellowstone and loved it! I bought that first. Then I got this one.The music is calming and pleasant. I like the II more than this one though.
2,Ambitious effort but mediocre music,"While I applaud the goal, the blend of authentic chants with electronica doesn't yield very entertaining results. The chants get in the way of the accompanying music (or vice-versa)."
5,The BEST NATIVE AMERICAN CD ever!,"Beautiful, hauntingly lovely songs....let the visions come...I always ""see"" when this CD is playing. Buy it in HONOR of the great Native Americans of this land and let your spirit be moved. It is fabulous!"
1,Native american music plus drum machine = campy.,"I purchased this album after hearing 'The Counter Clockwise..' song on the IMAX film ""Wolves"". I was disappointed because I was hoping for a more traditional sound. If you like Deep Forest, than you'll like the synthesizers and drum machine with only a smattering of actual chants and dances."
1,Discrace to Native Americans,"I listened to the album and it is completely overproduced with new wave, eletronic orchestrations that distract from the true meditative qualities of native american music. if any of you have been to a real powow (or something similar) where traditional and/or ceremonial native american music is played you'd know what I mean. THIS CD IS GARBAGE AND ALL RECORDINGS SHOULD BE DESTROYED! yet again another example of white man trying to make money off natives through exploitation."
5,Music for the spirit.,"I love this cd! I can't stop listening to it, never gets old. ""Celebrate"" is my favorite. A lot of the songs on the album have a good catchy beat which I like a lot followed by refreshing Native American vocals. Best cd in my collection yet!"
4,Good material,"I have a 10 lb terrier bix that is getting used to the backpack. It's made out of good material, the outside storage bags are a plus and the belt that snaps around the front is a good idea because you will need it do to the weight. It came in black, I was not able to pick what color but my main concern was the material and space. Wish it was a bit bigger so my dog could fit more confy sitting up, but other than that is a well made product."
5,Love the pet backpack!!,I love the pet backpack and my dog loves it too. I have a longhair chihuahua and he climbs into it even when we are not going anywhere. It is easy to use and is great for backpacking him or in the car or even in a stroller since he attaches to the backpack I dont have to worry about him getting out. Thanks... Pam
5,Perfect for my 10 lb. Chihuahua,"My doggie got really excited when she saw this b/c my boyfriend usually carries her in a regular Northface Backpack, but she would get too hot (we'd of course leave her head out). I carried her around it in and she was really comfortable and can curl into a ball comfortably. She's about 14-16 inches long (not including her tail) and about 10 lbs. I wouldn't recommend the bag for a longer dog but a dog up to 14 lb would be fine I think. The pockets are roomy but not tall so you can't fit a water bottle or anything. The bottom is structured so your dog will be able to sit comfortably and not sink down. If you lay the bag down, it doubles as a little house, which would be perfect for airplane rides. All in all, solid purchase. I do recommend it."
3,Worked as intended,Wasn't paying attention to description and thought this was a pack to carry upfront. I used it that way anyway and it worked ok.
3,Good for short trips.,"I was hoping to be able to use this for hiking with my Rat Terrier, Louie. He likes to go wherever I go, but sometimes gets tired on a long hike. I wanted to be able to use this as an option for him to be able to ride. It has little space for other items I need to carry with me when I hike. It would be really nice if there was a place to put water bottles. I do like the mesh sides so there is nice air flow for the dog. I would recommend it for those wanting to go on short trips with small dogs."
1,Nightmare!,"I got this bed for my two girls, ages 3 and 5. They were very excited and loved the beds, couldn't wait to sleep in them. The beds were easy to set up and inflate. However, my girls could not fall asleep. Every time they moved, the bed squeaked and groaned. Nothing helped - not a mattress cover, not extra padding on the floor, nothing. I am going to bring these beds back to Target. Anything would be better than this, even a simple mat on the floor."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM!!!!!!!!!!.,"DO NOT BUY IT, IF YOU THINK AS I DID THAT YOU WERE GOING TO GET A LIGHTING STAND LIKE IN THE PICTURE,""YOU WILL NOT"". THEY JUST SEND ME TWO 5"" TRUSS ,YOU DONT GET ANITHING ALSE.THEY DESCRIBE THE PRODUCT AS SOMETHING IS NOT, AND ON TOP OF THAT THE SHIPPING BOX WAS OLD,DIRTY AND BIG FOR THE ITEM.IT DOES NOT COME WITH ASSAMBLY INSTRUCTIONS."
3,Lighting stands,"For the $$$ you can't beat this set up. Yes it's thin walled and does scratch easy, but for $110 you can't expect much, just use your common sense, Don't over tighten things, Don't just toss this in the back of your truck and pile stuff on it. Treat it like it's fragile and it will last awhile, I've used it now for 2 red carpet events to hold lights and it's great. I have not used the beam yet, I just use the two stands and put 3 lights on each. Would I like it to be sturdier sure.. but that would mean $300-500 I would think, so I'll stick with this at the moment !!! I also bought the 4 sand bags for $20something and filled them up at the beach and the stands to up about 9' without any issues. at one event I even had some idiot from the insider film crew keep holding on to one stand for balance and it held up, I was ready to tell him to stop leaning on it, but the gig was over soon enough... good thing red carpet events are only an hour or so long."
4,wearing out,"I purchased these along with a number of other pairs of silk and wool black dress socks. I wanted to compare. The expensive wool socks are clearly the best feeling and best-looking, but all have worn fast."
3,Sad Socks,"The socks arrived in a timely manner and were what was promised. My complaint is that my husband wore them hunting one time, came home and they already had a hole in them. If I didn't know better I would advise against getting silk socks. The truth is he has had several pairs in the past that were other brands and they have lasted for a year or more."
1,CD SUX ARSE!!,"Cd sux! no songs and not authorized by no doubt! nothing about no doubt, a british woman reads trivial crap like what label they were signed to. some random dude wrote it. no juicy details or gwen love life info. just retarded retarded crap. i own EVERYHTING no doubt but I wouldn't pay a single PENNY for it. dont' get suckered into this it has no info just a way to make a buck off of someone else!! BUY if YOU LIKE USELESS CRAP ONLY!!"
3,not what i expect!,when i bought this product i was expecting a ITOYA ART PORFOLIOinstead i got a simple envelopes...wrong order!i am trying to return it.....has been hard!
1,be warned......,"I have a 15 year old son who reads way below level and strongly desires to read. We bought the book, believed what it said,hired the tutor for 1 1/2 years, and unfortunately ended up at about the same level. This program does not work. Thousandsof dollars later and .....he still askes me to spell and read simple words.Recently we started the SRA program and have had success!He is progressing and improving and developing a foundation to read. I kick myself for wasting so much time on Read Right.Please pass this by for a program like SRA, we wish we had figured it out sooner. Good luck, I know how heartbreaking it can be whenyou have a child who struggles to read."
4,READ RIGHT,I THINK THE BOOK HAS A LOT OF INFORMATION ON HELPING YOUR CHILD BE A BETTER READER. THIS IS A GREAT RESOURCE.
2,Not for older non-readers,"The techniques that comprise the bulk of this book are aimed at children just beginning to read. For older non-readers, the only answer seems to be to contact the author and pay for her tutoring program. I have sent e-mails to the address and have not received a reply."
5,5 stars at last,"This is one of the few (and I mean few) games on the Xbox that I would actually give 5 stars. I am a very harsh critic of games, esepcially those that end up on the Xbox that are over-hyped and don't live up to expectations. I grabbed this from a bargain-bin on impulse and man, I truly enjoyed it. The game is not meant to be taken serious, so has nothing to try and live up to. It is simply based on being fun - remember when games were just fun? You play a small robot with no real advantages and nothing special about you, but you have a great assortment of really interesting weapons that are all fun to use. You can even hack into other robots and control them for added fun.With nothing to complain about I will keep my review short - if you haven't tried this game, do it."
1,Misinformation,"Information supplied assured me that this game would work on the x box 360 console, but it does not. I even called x-box support and they confirmed that it was not copatible. Very dissappointed."
5,One of my favorite Xbox games,I had bought this game years ago and traded it in after I bought a 360. I bought this game again since I have the original Xbox in my basement. This game is very fun and funny as well
4,Fun Game,It took me awhile to get into this game but once I did it became one of my favorite titles. Not as good as HALO but it is a great way to divert yourself while you wait for HALO 2.
5,"Hard, But Fun......","How I describe this game is hard, but fun....It has 17 Weapons, all upgradable (I think)More than 50 levels (40+ in Single Player 10+ in multiplayer)Very intense firefights,Beautiful graphics,and ""Hillarious"" dialouge that is accually funny, and Dan Castellenta (The voice of Homer Simpson) does the voice of three of the characters in the game,But I warn you, the game is very tough to finish, not scream and break your controller and throw the disc out the window hard, just a intense challenge, but the rewards are great,DO NOT PASS THIS UP, I SURE DIDN'T! :DTiE"
5,Great Game,I dont feel like explaining why this game is so good because so many others already have. But it gets 5 stars!
4,Down by the Station book,the students really enjoy the story as part of our unit on animals and song.
4,Fun book for young children,"This book is based on the song ""Down by the Station"" that I remember singing as a child. The words are fun (with words like ""puff, puff, toot, toot, thrump, thrump"") and tell of a train picking up all sorts of animal passengers. The illustrations are fun, showing what appear to be Mom and Dad animals sending their children on the train to the zoo.I would recommend this for children ages 2-5, especially. They will like the repetitive text and the fun noises of the train, as well as the colorful illustrations."
5,A Winner!,This has been a favorite in our house since my daughter turned two - she is now almost three. We never get tired of the great illustrations or the song! We highly recommend this version.
3,The 3 star rating,"the book was ok but just after using for my exams, someone broke into my car and stole the book. What a sad end of a treasured book."
1,They filled up with water,"These are NOT weatherproof speakers. I mounted them on a deck railing and they worked fine for one season, but the next year one stopped working. When I took it off to troubleshoot, it was FILLED with water. I opened it up and found that the capacitors had corroded off of the crossover board, plus the cones were a soggy mess. The other speakers was also full but not filled to the brim with water, but still made sound.They might do better if mounted under the eves of the house or in an area that offers some protection from rain and snow. Bose offers no guidance regarding the weather resistance or the places to mount them. They cost $300 for the pair and sounded just ok. I feel that they were mis-represented."
2,Lasted 3 summers,"Bought these after having a very positive experience with the Bose Wave stereo. I set them up in my backyard every summer and brought them indoors every winter. The sound was OK and I did receive a few compliments from people - then all of a sudden the sound got distorted. I thought it was my receiver (as it was small, cheap and under-powered) so I changed it. Still distorted. Then I thought it was my speaker wire - so I changed that too - still distorted. So the the only answer is the speakers. So the sum of my experience is this: Paid over $300 - treated them with care - got 3 summers of OK sound - now I have to shop for new speakers. Definitely not a quality product and I won't be buying Bose again."
2,"Not quite ""all weather"" (3rd pair just failed)","Easy to install and great sound for my patio. However, my third pair just bit the dust - the diaphragms have cracked from exposure, making the sound unbearable. The previous two pairs met the same fate.In fairness, the speakers get 90 degree heat and Sun all summer and our Colorado winters are quite cold and dry... but that's why I bought all weather outdoor speakers.Bose has been accommodating (the store where I bought the first pair wouldn't even replace the first pair), but this is just getting old. I'm going to try a different brand."
1,Too small!,this is way too small for hamsters you can barely fit a food bowl in it and theres no place for a sleeping hut either and hamsters need sleeping huts so don't buy this
5,Great grips,"As a lefty I naturally am drawn to things made specifically for us. These fit my Mark I just fine, and have a great look and feel to them."
2,Ehhh....,Will not work on some Ruger Mark III models. I did not know that the Mark III I as getting had grips that cannot be removed. Live and learn... not the vendor's fault & I bet this is a great grip. Had to return.
3,Great set for kids to learn on,"We have 2 chess sets in our home. We have a nice set that the kids and I play on but it's too nice to let the kids (ages 9 and 12) play on without supervision. That's why I bought this set. It's inexpensive so I don't worry about them messing it up. The set seems durable although the board itself is a hard cardboard so it could be ripped. The pieces are very, very light plastic so they will easily fall over. If it was a set for an adult-you'd probably be disappointed but as an eventual throw-away set for the kids, it's perfect."
3,Not Durable,"the pieces are not heavy enough. not sure if that helps but when you pick up the queen, it just feels very light. plus after a few uses, the felt sticker at the bottom of the pieces start coming apart."
4,Chess review,This is a standard chess set. If you have children you may opt for this set. It is very durable.
4,Good Intro & General Purpose Set,"This chess set and board is perfect for people who are just getting into chess or someone who doesn't need an expensive & fancy set. The pieces are big and durable. The board, though a little flimsy, does it's job. The board's colors can be a little hard on the eyes if you play a long time, but for the price, you can't beat it."
5,A Mismatch,"The pieces are a good size and weight but the board is truly cheezy. Mine folds in 1/2 which is ok, but the cardboard is quite thin compared to the substantial peices and the paper grid is not even aligned properly. Overall though its a fair value for the $$."
5,Great Chess Set For The Money,"Pavillions ""Master Chess"" set is easy on the eyes, unlike many other sets on the market. I love the look. The pieces are large and durable, which will fit nicely on any tournament size wood board. If your into chess play, this set is your best bet for the money."
5,Hogan Still Rules!!!,Hulk totally revolutionized the sport of pro wrestling w/ his undieing charisma and tumultuious attitude. He single handedly carved his own legend in the fabric of time. Anyone interested in this man's historic career would have a great read w/ this book.
5,Hulk's literary debut rules!,"Probably the most famous professional Athlete in the world today,and my childhood hero, Hulk Hogan shows us what we never knew about him or the sport of wrestling.It is a hard book to put down. Once the story unfolds, it gets very interesting (and wild at times!) and makes for an interesting story that begins at his childhood and ends with his match at Wrestlemania X8 with The Rock.But this book may only be something that wrestling fans would really enjoy- some people might find it boring, but I found it informative.Here's hoping Hulk decides to pen another novel within the next couple of years!"
2,Way too sparse,"Each chapter is maybe 3 pages at most, with lots of pictures throughout. Thus, there isn't a lot of actual writing in this book. It took me a couple of hours to read this.There were some interesting antecdotes, but not a lot of info about the Hulkster that hasn't been available in interview form"
3,hulkamania not so wild,"he really didnt go into too much detail about anything in this book, it certainly wasnt as good as both mick foleys. i still dont know who trained himetc etc. must try harder!"
1,Skirts and Rationalizes all the way,"I could go into long detail on his ""rationalization"" of controversial fixes Hogan was caught up in like steroids, Vince and holding back younger wrestlers through his backstage politics.However, this one important timepiece Hogan makes pretty much no mention of whatsoever was Starcade 1997 and Sting. He never once admits to having too big of an ego to cleanly lose to Sting/Steve Borden at all in this book. Skirting a well known wrestling feud where his ego was put ahead of ""what was best for business"" in WCW at the time with Sting automatically negates this book as a TRUE AND HONEST AUTOBIOGRAPHY."
2,Gimme a Break!,"Being a longtime fan of wrestling and Hulk Hogan, I opened the cover really wanting to love this book. I didn't. This book insults the intelligence of a true wrestling fan (or any reader for that matter). At points there seems to be some honesty or sincerity but those points soon get turned into long tales. Hulk Hogan appears to try to take credit for everything from the idea of selling merchandise, to carrying wrestling on his shoulders alone, to being responsible for the purchase of WCW. The Hulkster doesn't need his fans to sing his praises... He does that himself!"
2,"Hulkamania's running sorta wild, but not really....","This was an entertaining book, sure, but it really doesn't tell the reader all that much about Hulk Hogan or the Wrestling industry that you couldn't find elsewhere. Hogan seems to tell a great anecdote, but skimps on details. Rowdy Roddy Piper is only mentioned once, although the Hogan-Piper feud was HUGE back in the day. Macho Man Randy Savage is written off as a ""Horse's bum,"" but never does ""the Hulkster"" explain why he felt that way. Other wrestling icons who helped get Hogan over with the people don't even get mentioned. The book is random, unfocused, and short changes all the people who helped make Hulk Hogan into the legendary performer he is today. It's like a bunch of unconnected incidents put into Hulkalogical order and printed with BIG pictures."
2,Quality Issues,"I was very excited about this device, as I have a trading system that I run in the background, and I like the idea of using this little device to show me status while working on other items. However, when I received the device, the middle display was ""dim"" compared to the other two. So much so that not only was the middle display not really usable, but it detracted from the other two displays - you simply could not ignore the display.I contacted support via email and explained the problem. They suggested the device needed to be replaced, but they never replaced it. I never got any follow through on how to replace the device. So it just sits here collecting dust."
2,"neat gadget, yet it's really a solution looking for a problem","somehow this gadget fails to perform an actually useful function. i tried hard to find something i could only do with it, but failed. yes the 3 buttons look cool, but so what. i can assign a macro to keys on my mac keyboard for free..."
3,WISH THEY WERE WASHABLE!!!,"Crayola has 64 washable markers, 8, 16, 24 pack of washable crayons, but no more than this. They really need to get rid of all the original Crayons and make all their products washable."
4,new box,"I love to color. I was surprised at the fact that I found another reduction in product quality though. The crayons aren't as solid and the box is flimsy for this large of a pack. I was surprised by this, but I guess this is how they sell us the other containers."
5,Great brand,I love Crayola crayons they don't get chalky or filmy like some brands do. They are good on any paper material you are trying to draw or color on as well.
5,great product,Grand kids loved these. Especially the sharpener was a big hit. Most of the colors are ready to be melted down for use in the color making tool.
3,"Good, Swift Read","""Brady's Law"" is a quick read. It moves along at a nice pace and doesn't drag at all. Characters are developed fairly well. If I have a problem with this book, it's that it isn't very original. The story is good enough but I just can't give it more than three stars.In this book, Dan Brady is a man content with spending the rest of his days raising his family and some horses in New Mexico. He doesn't want trouble with anyone but, as in most Westerns, he ends up in the wrong place at the wrong time. Naturally, he loses everything even though he tries to make amends with certain folks over a murder that he witnesses. He finds out real quick that sometimes you have to take charge of the situation regardless of your convictions or the odds stacked against you.This was an enjoyable, quick read. Once again, I only gave it three stars due to lack of originality."
4,"Overall, good shoes","I've had these shoes for about a year now and they have held up well. They aren't as cushioned as the description leads you to believe but they are still comfortable. I wear them to work but I sit behind a desk most of the day, except for the quarter mile or so it takes to walk from my car to my office. My only quibbles are that the traction on very wet or icy surfaces isn't very good (but I have snow mocs for bad weather) and the toebox scuffs fairly easily. They still look pretty good though and there are no tears or lose threads in the seams, and I haven't noticed any loss of support."
5,The Bible for child care professionals. A must read!,A terrific reference. Anyone who wants to be the best child care teacher they can be should own this book. It's my Bible for developing and maintaining my developmentally appropriate teaching style.
4,written review,The book came on time and looks brand new. I will definately use amazon when I need my next textbook for school.
5,Excellent True-Crime Series,"""Interpol Investigates"" is a slickly produced true-crime series. Season One (I received the entire season consisting of four discs, not two, from an Amazon Marketplace Vendor, bless him)offers a variety of stories, from muderers like Ira Einhorn to a serial killer finding his victims on a train to an art theft. It's interesting to learn how Interpol (International Police force) helps other law-enforcement agencies, including those in the U.S., catch criminals who cross international borders to escape prosecution. Note: The theme music is exotic and hauntingly beautiful! It produces dopamine in my brain! If you like true crime, I highly recommend this series. I'm already hunting for Season Two!"
5,They're great,"This is the highest thread count I've bought so far, and I am pretty pleased with them. They definitely get softer each time they're washed, and I love the color (parchment). If I could think of anything negative I would say that they wrinkle very easily."
3,Blue Dragon Through My Son's Eyes,"He loves it! But then, he's eight, and a boy. To me, it's just another noisy cartoon, ho-hum. ;-) The positives are that there is no cussing, and in spite of all the fighting there's no actual blood and gore."
4,Almost Like Being There,A wonderful collection of traditional Russian music. Takes me back to when I lived there. A FUN CD full of Russian spirit.
5,This one is perfect!,"Fans of Indy and adventure alike, rejoice! This book is PERFECT in every way! An absolute must for readers. I could not put this one down!Long live Indiana Jones!"
2,Read another Indy book...,"I was extremely disappointed in this book. The dialogue was no good, the story line was no good, and the ending was really just pretty pointless. I closed the book feeling cheated, especially since I owed the library for late fees! This kind of bummed me out, as I really enjoyed Indiana Jones and the Dinosaur Egg and hoped for another good adventure story. But it was not to be. Try another author, if you would really like an engrossing Indiana Jones novel..."
2,It's just not Indiana Jones!,"I must say that I looked forward to reading all these Indiana Jones books. I had picked one of the newer ones at my schools library and it was great. Thus, I went to Amazon.com and bought the whole series. However, I have since read the first 5 in the series and am very disappointed. They were just terrible. In fact, they are getting worse and worse by the book. I guess I don't find the books to reflect the world of Indiana Jones. There is too much mystical elements and the theme it too far-fetched. This book was the worst of the lot though. I had to force myself to finish it one night and up to the end I was not impressed. Oh well, I will finish the series eventually (but not for awhile...I can't bring myself to start the next one yet)."
3,Why Do We Support These Types Of Books?,"Like Dune House of Atreides, Doctor Who Interference and Young Indy and Trenches of Hell (All Of Which I've Reviewed), this is silly pulp that doesn't hold the integrity of the original. What's the point here besides make more money off a good thing? Buh!"
2,IJ-and the Genesis Deluge,"An interesting story but not very ""Indiana Jones"" like. The story starts slow and builds even slower. The drug references are distracting and detailed in such a way as to be a little disturbing. Basically, not what I was expecting...disappointing."
2,Yawn,"Usually when I yawn I stretch, and this is something Genesis Deluge never seems to stop doing. After reading a few of Rob MacGregor's entries into this franchise (none of them bad, but never better than good) I have realized that he doesn't have much talent for anything other than taking a small idea and s-t-r-e-t-c-h-i-n-g it out to novel length with all the usual padding.In this one Indy is encouraged to go to Mount Ararat to looks for Noahs Ark. Sounds like it's going to be filled with adventure huh? Think again! The ark shows up 14 pages from the end of the book and when Indy is finally inside NOTHING is detailed.and the book pretty much comes to a stop right there.I won't say I was bored by this book, and I almost gave it 3/5, but the fact that there was no big revelation in the final chapter made the effort getting to the ark (for me and for Indy) utterly pointless.The weakest one so far. But I still have a good feeling about the rest of the books."
5,Dangerous Adventure,"This is an action packed adventure with Indiana Jones searching for Noah's Ark! After fighting off to Russian twins through the whole book, Indiana Jones tries two find the Ark on top of a mountain where it landed hundreds of years ago. Can Indy survive the dangerous trail to the top?, or will the Russians find him first? Great Book! A+!"
2,A product of mass production,"This book aims low and achieves its mark. If you want action, this book has it. And MacGregor has done his homework regarding the details of Arkeology. But the book has little else. The plot is largely predictable. Difficulties are overcome by paranormalism and luck rather than by skill. The characters have some dimension but still come off as stereotyped. In short, the book has no depth. It is entertaining, but there are plenty of other books in the world that offer entertainment *and* high quality."
3,"A good read but, Indy's not tough enough","This was the fourth Indy book by MacGregor I've read.Like the rest, I found it well-written but dry at times.There tends to be less action than the movies but, in it'sdefense, his charactization of Indy is pretty close.On the most positive note,this book kept more with the movies than the previous ones did, as there is a race to gain a Biblical artifact; and some religious issues were touched on between the opposing sides.Personally, the most negative point I found was Indy spends most of book either captured or getting beat up and THEN captured.Granted, I know we're talking about a younger Indy here and hedoesn't have his later experience but, he's still Indiana Jones.Let's bust a few heads already. We're four books in now and theaction is still lacking."
4,Pretty good,"Overall, I thought this was a pretty good Indy novel. It didn't have me as spellbound as _Dance of the Giants_, but the locales, plot, and variety of characters (Bolsheviks, Chicago mob, Janissaries) are enough to make it a worthwhile read."
4,Just as described,"Purchased because of the wider straps and am happy to say it is much more comfortable to wear than the spaghetti style straps. Slip is a little on the thin side as far as material quality goes and I hope it will do its job as far as modesty goes.Very fast shipping, I received 4 days before the projected delivery date."
5,Wide Strap Slip - Purchased from Amazon.com,I have already reviewed this once. I like the slip very much. It fits well and feels nice next to the skin. Just the right length for my dresses and skirts. I received it quickly ... sooner than anticipated.
1,make up your mind,ok look this game cant not seem to come out date due out. the way i see it set a date then relase it. quit with the games set a date then fall threw. If my memory servce me right it was due the same time the the movies where due. i had been looking foward to play it but now im un sure about it.
5,New fan,"After hearing the song Dependence (so beautiful it gives me chills) on the radio, and finding out who the artist is, I bought this CD and the others I could find from Amazon. The guy is awesome. I love his voice and his style, reminds me a bit of Richard Marx and Michael W. Smith. This is an excellent CD, I love the ballads especially."
1,Good Music That God Tailed to Me!,When I need God to talk to me he did.In a moment in my life when no one knew what l was going thoug I listened to the CD.I cryed but it was a good thing.Thanks to Jamie.His music was there.I love the CD!
3,It's okay,"I don't have much to say about Legend of Himiko it was okay but it could have been a lot better the story was good but the characters were like flat it's hard to explain but the characters didn't really have personality so much so that I can't even remeber there names and I'm usally good with characters names the only one I remember was Himiko just because it is the name of the title, But it's still worth checking out it's an old anime and it is not bad, but like I said I did not like any of the characters."
4,Different,"Not a bad little series, but it wasn't long enough. I think more should have been done with the two leading characters. The opening song is good. I would certainly watch it again, but the ending left me hoping for a continuation."
4,I love this series!!!!!!!!,"Even though I somehow managed to pay more than I wanted for this series, I really enjoyed it. It has good animation and the story was relatively easy to follow, unlike some other animes. The only thing that got me was that up until the last episode, the battles weren't really realistic because of the lack of blood. Other than that, I really like this series and I think anyone who likes fantasy will enjoy it.I'd give it 4 and a half, but it only lets me pick whole numbers..."
2,Certainly dated,"STICKS AND STONES was my first ""gay novel"", and even when I read it back in the early seventies (in a trade paperback edition), I knew enough to realize that the two main characters werent like me or any of my gay friends. The protagonist is sixteen and trying to ignore who and what he is, so much so that you really want to shake him very, very hard. I didnt find the writer character as self-obsessed as the other reviewer here, but let's face it: it's a testament to the 1970s that one could write about a sixteen year old and a twenty four year old and not worry that the reader would find it borderline ""eww icky"".It is what it is, written now almost forty years ago by someone with good intentions but little real insight into what coming out involves. The ending is a serious cop-out, ambiguous to the point where you know that these two will continue to live in complete and utter denial of their feelings about each other."
2,Perhaps not real Citric Acid,"This product does not perform like small quantity (and more expensive) citric acid obtained through drugstores. Our primary use is to remove hard-water and mineral stains in our dishwasher. Citric acid purchased at drugstores has always worked - this citric acid does not. In fact, we suspect it may be labeled ""Citric Acid"" but is actually something less potent - in somewhat the same way that vendors sell boxes of TSP which is not actually tri-sodium phosphate."
2,"I like the series, but...","Tokyopop did a pretty lousy job on these DVDs if you prefer watching them in Japanese.Their translation quality is worse than most of the other american companys these days. They also completely change scenes with Japanese text, often replacing them with poor English translations, so the original meaning is lost. I won't be buying another Tokyopop DVD."
5,blood lust and friends will never be the same,this product shows you the advancher of a young vamipre who saves the town she is in from shinma. But it also shows keep your friends close but you enime closer type deal nere the end and shows you the choice you have to do in order to make the one thing in you life to be complete and that is be a slave to your destiny or to choose your life.
3,"Great anime, disappointing DVDs","I just managed to get my hands on the Ultimate boxed set and I can say I am far from being impressed after watching the first volume. Although it is one of my favorite anime series, the DVDs were poorly done. Half the DVD players I tried wouldnt even play them properly, the bitrate seems to be quite low, and the Ops and Eds were cut to only be displayed during the first and last episodes on the DVD. Hell, Id almost think I had gotten a bootleg by mistake. Even more disappointing is that it appears noone even bothered to translate the ed lyrics. Overall, I would say I paid alot more then I should have for the boxed set."
2,Miyu,"A little confusing at times. Also, the story lines are not great. It is a little more violent than needed at times too."
3,Average,"This is an average anime in terms of plot, animation and character development. It does have an excellent character design for Miyu. If you get a chance to rent it, do so. If you have to buy it in order to watch it, don't. Save your money for something more worthwhile.Many of the episodes have a monster-of-the-week favor. The story usually revolves around the theme of obsession, but it is usually not too inspired. The animation quality is that which you can expect from made-for-TV animations. In other words, they are nothing to write home about. The only thing good about the series is a very alluring character design for Miyu, which is quiet, enigmatic, seductive and dangerous. In a word - vampiric!"
2,VPM,"It's hideous, it has no on-DVD printing (it looks blank),it has no quality whatsoever (except the quality of the playing/viewing); I would've prefer to throw my money into the toilet and see it flush!!"
2,Princess Miyu anime,I thought that the anime in the DVDs is very good and anime fans would enjoy whatching it. Although the episodes contain alot of unnessisary violence and a very repetitive plot. Alothough I do not like the idea in each sieres the music is very good.
3,Some Puns Intended,"Pleasant police procedural cum village look-into. There's the home-grown university-educated policeman, the computer-savy computer-entroprenur red-haired woman come to the family holding, a party, a corpse/a riffled room, the customary usual suspects. A series, but read this first to know the set-up. Worth your time."
4,The truth behind New Yorks Five Points gangs,"Forget about Ashbury's Gangs of New York. That muddle of yellow journalism and folklore that served as a basis for an even more muddled movie is far overshadowed by this well researched and documented look at the reality behind the infamous Five Points slum in old New York. Solid scholarship by Anbinder reveals the racial and ethnic bigotry behind much of the stories found in Ashbury's book- most surprisingly, that no such gang as the Dead Rabbits ever existed except in the minds and columns of New York newspapermen. Using census records Anbinder careful reveals the real lives of the working people of the Five Points through its times as an Irish, African, Chinese slum. This book is a vital resource for those who value New York 19th century history."
3,Seems like it's written by a statistitian.,I was looking for an enjoyable read with some personal stories of the rabble but I'm afraid this didn't deliver. This was more general statistical data like something from the Census Bureau. Mostly generalities with a small spattering of a short story here or there or particulars that I just didn't care about. I do know the author worked his butt off researching all this info however or I would've given it even fewer stars for enjoyable reading. There is lots of info if that's what you're after.
4,Irish In New York,"Tyler Anbinder presents a history ostensibly focused narrowly on a lower Manhattan neighborhood. In actuality, Anbinder not only delivers the history of the Five Points area, but he also conveys a larger sense of the context and background that made this neighborhood significant. Anbinder organizes his material into very approachable chapters, each preceded by a brief illustrative anecdote or incident, which relates to the theme of the specific section."
4,Well researched,"Great book on NYC history. Anbinder has done a good job of digging up what may seem to the casual reader as ancillary - or even tediously unnecessary - information. But going through church rolls and Emigrant Savings bank records gives a very personal and human touch to the information. This wasn't just a ""slum;"" this was a thriving neighborhood, in a packed city, with a multitude of characters, displaying the best and worst of human behavior.A good text for a serious history student. Scorcese fans who want a companion book to his recent movie should get Herb Asbury's instead, which has proven to be part history, part mythology, and more in step with the film.Sure, it was a rough neighborhood, but it can't possibly be any worse than any New York neighborhoods of the 20th century. Anbinder merely gives us the evidence that New York, for all its changes, is a timeless City."
2,Don't waste your money,"My husband purchased this product for me shortly after finding out that we were expecting. The scent is nice and light, but I find that the lotion never fully absorbs in to my skin. It doesn't help with itching what so ever. Way too expensive, and doesn't deliver what it promises."
2,Mustela not for me,"I'm in my 4th month of pregnancy and have been using Mustela for 1,5 month now. I've been recommended this product by my friends who recently had babies and didn't get any stretch marks (they were using Mustela on regular basis for more than 7 months).I cannot comment on its results on stretch marks as I haven't got any (yet).2 drawbacks of the cream that I find very disturbing:- smell- it's definitely too strong for me and makes me sick each time I apply the cream. The smell rests a long time on the skin and the clothes absorb it, too.- moisture- it stays the whole day on your body and makes the skin sticky (even if you apply a thin layer)!I've been desperately looking for another product to replace this one (I really tried hard using Mustela for 1,5 month every morning- impossible to use it twice a day as recommended!) and just bought Bio Oil that I'm going to try."
2,Don't waste your money!!,"I used this product everyday, twice a day and even rubbed it in just like the directions said. 8 months in and no strech marks but... in the last couple of weeks my stomach was full of them. Don't waste your money ladies."
4,It works!,"use together with dr Palmers butter and you'll be fine! if possible, use almond oil and hipoglos too (from Brazil)."
5,Mustela is a MUST HAVE!,"This product is a must have for pregnant women! You may have seen mixed reviews about it, but you should not pass it up. If you start using this product from the beginning it will condition your skin so you will not get stretch marks. I'm on baby number 2 and have ZERO stretch marks from my first child. You cannot use this product late in your pregnancy and expect it to work. You should try and use it by month 3 for it to be effective and use it all over your belly, sides, breasts and under your underarms (next to your breasts). I HIGHLY recommend this product as well as all Mustela products. The baby products are even more amazing. They are a bit expensive but at least they work, and you do get your money's worth."
3,About what I expected...,"Well, I waited until it died, and it took 17 months, as I purchased it in September of 2004. I don't want to be negative, but I didn't want to review it after only a couple of problems, or only after a month of successful operation, either.This unit did OK for the time it worked. Let's face it, very few electronics last for more than a couple of years, nowadays. In this case, we had no issues as a DVD player (and still don't), other a slightly dark picture, but 90% of the DVD +R's we insert for recording now issue a ""Write Fail"" message.We used it heavily as a player and recorder during that time, so the money we saved by recording family movies payed for itself. All in all, it was about what I expected.Now I am off to WalMart for another $89 model..."
1,Disc destroyer! Money wasted.,"The LVW-5101 was my first dvd recorder. I figured 139.99 was a bargain considering how new the technology was.Unfortunately, the unit developed quirks right away like the clock that runs way too fast, picking up a few minutes every day.Sometimes the unit stopped in the middle of a recording session and sometimes it started recording when it wanted. Either way it wasted my money because the disc was ruined.Now it ruins discs that have been recorded but not finalized by overwriting automatic formating because it does not recognize recordings made by itself. And it confuses dvd+r with dvd+rw, thereby ruining the disc.I must say I am pretty sour on the Lite-on brand."
2,5101 Liteon recorder,"One of the most disappointing of all the Liteon recorders,most of the Liteon recorders are super easy to use but this one is a real odd ball, with little in common with the rest of the excellent Liteon 5000 series of recorders.Buy a Liteon 5001,5007,5005 or 5006 instead these are far easier to use and all readily accept updated firmware."
2,Buggy and frustrating,"I bought it because it was cheap. The machine has lots of bugs:- Locks-up- Gains time every day, making the clock wrong- Won't always record- Menus are difficult to read- Subtitles appear by default, and I have to turn them off every time- Poor range on remote controlThere were a couple of good features though:- Multiple inputs- Direct DV port in front, makes for easy transfer from camcorder- Cheap"
2,Not a Happy Camper,I received my bracelet and wore it a total of 2 times and the bracelet snapped a part -- losing most of the Gems that fell apart on the street.Was never able to recover not even half of the gems to restore this bracelet.
4,Charmingly retro,"A sweet account of the antics of the bears of Yellowstone Forest written mid-last century. A wonderful, read aloud addition to a child's library. I was given an autographed copy of this book when I was about 8 years old...am now 69 and still happy to have it in my ""for keeps"" library."
2,If it wasen't for the warenty,"I have had this notebook for about 3 months, and the Hard drive faild on me 3 times! I re installed windows vista 3 times and the problem kept happening. The notebook is nice if it worked. I would rate this a 1 start but the warenty on this product is great. great customer service! i think the problem is the vista and not the notebook. another thing is that the notebook gets fairly hot, even on a flat hard wood or glass table. I would def. buy an HP over a Vaio."
3,Battery Terminal Location Prohibits Installation,"The unconventional location of the positive and negative terminal posts (located in center vs closer to edge) may prohibit the installation of the battery in most modern vehicles. Example is the battery group size does fit in my 2007 Infiniti, however, the connectors could not reach the battery terminals due to the center location. Fortunately I was able to install the battery in my 1990 Honda (just barely)."
4,"Battery works great, but did not really fit my car","I bought this to replace a dead battery in a 2003 Subaru Forester. The battery itself is great, the car starts up immediately and it held a charge.The only problem I have is that the parts compatibility check said it would fit my car, while technically this is true, it doesn't fit easily and perfectly.The terminals on this battery are located in the center of the battery, and the OEM battery has the terminals on the edge of the battery, so the + terminalclamp would not reach + terminal properly. I had to push the battery out of position a little bit to get the cables to reach the + terminal. The - terminalwas fine.Would have given 5 stars had it not been for the terminal location issue."
1,unable to get warranty,This battery lasted a little over 2 years. Charging with a good battery charger that also De-sulfates hasn't helped. Tried calling Exide the lady I spoke with couldn't be bothered to stop eating while talking. She gave me the number for a rep in the northern part of my state and that rep gave me a number for a rep in the south both over 200 miles away. The few Local businesses that sell Exide batteries do not sell this particular one so they won't pro rate it because they have nothing in their inventory to scan and give me a price on another. So if you are buying a battery online make sure you can actually get warranty service it's not like you can box it up and send it back to Amazon.
5,Simple and effective,I know it's just a piece of tempered steel with a dipped in plasticote handle but it's the perfect piece. It really makes digging out tangles easier. I have owned Mantis Tillers for nearly twenty years and just got a detangler a month or so ago. What a difference! Don't buy the tiller without buying this!
4,Works as advertised,"I tried it, and it is easier than trying to stick your hands in there to pull out the debris. But I find that it is just faster and easier to pull the wheels off and clear it out."
2,works but flat head screwdriver could do the trick too,product just to have a product. Not really much other than plasti dipped piece of co cr with semi sharp hook on it. works by pulling rather than pushing but screwdriver should do the trick for you.
3,This blacklight is Ok,"It arrived today, and it works OK, but it isn't very bright. It wasn't very expensive, so I wasn't surprised. I think I will get a blacklight that's a little brighter next time around :)"
2,Sub-Par,"SO its not terrible but these are pretty lame black lights. I run a fraternity house and bought four of these. There is only 1 24"" bulb in it. For the cost you may just want to go to Lowes and buy a florescent light fixture and backlight bulbs. You can get a 4 foot fixture + two 4 foot lights for $30 all year round.Like I said, this is a decent backlight, but trust me the light quality is sub-par."
1,My first blacklight,"I bought this blacklight with the intention of using it in my apartment. My living room is an okay size, but this light was not strong enough to fill it. This does not emit much light and is not very powerful for simple household use and an overall disappointment. Packaging was spot on, but Amazon always gets it right :)"
1,Broken when received,The blacklight was broken when we got it. The lightbulb itself was shattered. I would like it resent or would like a refund.
2,Poorly stitched,The seam near the feet opened after the fourth use and zipper detached. Not sure how it could have happened as it was being used by my 9 yr old son....his feet don't even reach down that far.
3,Poor Quality Zipper,Bag is great except the zipper broke on the first use. Recommend another model. Packs very small with cinch bag.
5,awesome,This will be a great gift for my son who loves to have outdoorsy stuff - will be great to add to his collection - arrived quickly and in great shape! thank you
3,Strike Force not for the real bowler,"For kids this game is OK, but if you're a real bowler, it misses the mark as it dosen't react as you would expect from the bowlers perspective. Moving right/left, hitting your mark, trying to bowl with a hook does not work properly. The comments from the bowlers in our family are...the person that designed this game never bowled a game in his/her life. Comments from the non-bowlers are...this game is fun to play. That's why I gave it 3 stars."
5,shut the $#%@! up!,"How would you like to explain to your boss, neighbor, wife or kids what this one means? You're on your own for a good answer to that acronym. Silence the Finnish Uvulas? It had better make sense, or they'll look it up online, so beware! This one goes beyond geekness to the realm of tacky and low-class - but then again, what's high class about wearing a t-shirt with words on it, anyway?"
3,"recipes, etc.",I MADE THE MISTAKE THAT THE FIRST LISTED WOULD HAVE THE MOST RECIPES. WRONG. 60+PAGES (OVER 1/2 OF PAGES )ARE OF COOKIES. WANTED MORE BARS AND BROWNIES. HAVE 2 BAD LEGS AND THEY ARE EASIER TO MAKE FOR ME. QUITE A FEW RECIPES DO SOUND GOOD BUT RESENTLY HAD SURGERY SO HAVEN'T HAD A CHANCE TO TRY YET. ALSO NO PICS. WOULD MUCH PREFER PICS OF RECIPES.RECIEVED QUICKLY.
1,cheaply made flag,I understand this was an inexpensive product but come on.Very cheaply made even as a banner which I think should not be advertised as a flag at all.Its like spray painting a pair of nylons.Thats how thin it is. Should be ashamed to sell ths.
5,Great place to start an understanding of MPD/DID,"This is an excellent place to start to gain an understanding of MPD/DID. As the wife of a survivor with Dissociative Identity Disorder, this book has helped me to help my husband in his healing journey both practically and spiritually. I highly recommend this book to anyone who knows someone with DID/MPD and wishes to be an encouragement and a friend who can walk alongside. It is a must read for Pastors, and counselors and family and friends of survivors with DID/MPD. And having met and talked with Dr. Friesen personally, I appreciate his compassion and commitment to those who yet suffer from the bondage laid on them as children. ~~Susan"
1,DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!!!!!,"Do not buy this book. This book in the hands of an untrained minister nearly ruined my life. This book in the hands of the same minister caused another woman to die. The teachings in this book are unfounded in Scripture and are dangerous. I was told that I had MPD based on the teachings of this author. I have since undergone much psychological testing that proved I did not have and never did have MPD. These teachings nearly destroyed my family. Whatever you do, do not buy into the teachings in this book. I am still in the process of recovering from this trauma. This book and this author are also recommended reading for those interested in spiritual warfare. Do not buy this book, it is a horrible book filled with lies with the capacity to destroy people."
2,Not worth the money,"For the price of $59.95 I would expect to be shown how to do more than one cut. The teacher is fine, but the interview with another older facetor was boring. This really should be a $20 video.Wish I could have rated it higher.Wanda"
2,Big fellas beware,It was comfortable and roomy up until the frame snapped like a twig while i was getting out of it.
1,Rip off.,"I understand its not a lot of money for this chain, but to call it diamond cut. What a joke. I have it a few days now and theres no shine at all to it. Its just a grey rope chain.Items that are diamond cut usually gleam. Theres more shine to a grey crayola crayon than there is on this necklace.What a major disappointment."
4,CHAIN,"THE CLASP IS GREAT THE DIAMOND CUT LOOKS WONDERFUL AND THE CHAIN DOES'NT GET CAUGHT IN YOUR HAIRI WOULD RECOMMEND THIS AS A GREAT BUY FOR ANYONE WHO NEEDS A 24"" CHAIN"
5,nechlace,i was pleased to be able to purchase a neclace i could put over my head as i have arthritice in my fingers and can not do clasps
4,Worked well with pendant,My wife likes longer chains for her pendants and this worked very nice with chocolate diamond pendant I got her for Christmas.
5,Excellent Product!,I was very impressed with the quality of this chain. It is gorgeous and looks great with my favorite pendant!
4,Perfect length and thickness for me!,"I bought this to replace a necklace worn with a pendant my grandmother gave me. I was concerned the length would be too short, since I wanted to take it off from around my neck without having to undo the clasp, and I was easily able to do so, so I can't attest to the durability of the clasp mechanism. I've been wearing this for a few months now everyday, and it's still holding up strong. I wear it while jogging and mountain biking, and it hasn't broken. There's no discoloration on my skin, so that's always a plus =) It isn't a super shiny polish, which is perfect for me. This isn't really for other people to see anyways, I wear it under my shirt. The diamond-cut pattern is simple yet elegant. I should note that when I received the necklace, it was kinked pretty bad, and it took some twisting and turning to smooth it out, but it's fine now. Overall, looks good, feels fine against my skin, and is sturdy."
1,Major disappointment....,"I thought it was my best buy for I read a good reviews about the item. Until the day it was delivered. When I opened the box, saw a small piece of metal ripped off from the chain and there's just a piece of metal holding the both ends of the chain. Moreover, it is not sterling at all. I wore it for just a few days and its not gleaming anymore. A diamond cut usually gleam. This is NOT. I wish I could return the item but it is just a waste of time of sending this back and wait for the refund or replacement for more days. I am not just happy with the item."
5,perfect for me,received very quickly and was so pleased. will definately order from this vendor again.
5,Family pleaser,"This stuff is great. My picky eater children will eat it, as it is flavorful but not too spicy. They don't always like Indian food, either, so it's nice to find something that we can all enjoy together."
1,lost of money,"It only last 1 year and i couldn't find where to get the free 18 months replacement that appears on the warranty. I sent emails to Exide Batteries, and have no answers... it is incredible what a scam these batteries are and there is no warranty, nobody will replace your battery or your money back. Yesterday, the battery on my car died, it was another brand from walmart it last 2 years and 10 months, i just went to the store WITHOUT receipt of purchase,and still got a new one for 2.06$ !!!! and still with 3 years of free replacement!!"
1,Don't waste your money,I had a pair of exide nautilus batteries go bad after 9 months. Don't waste your money! I would go with any other brand available.
1,bad battery,I had a exide obital and starting agm both only lasted 2 years. Have had cheap batteries last 3. Bought an optima same time still works great going to replace my exide battteries with optimas.
5,Primo,"This is a must read for anyone who wants to know about Christianity in the Middle East before the Muslim conquests and the following massacres.The recounts are made by those who saw the events take place and were able to record them without a great relapse of time. I encourage everyone to read this and take it all in, read it a few times, about one year after the last time you read it and each time it is better than the last.The miracles stories are told very matter of fact and factually with great detail yet they retain their wonder. I admit, I believe all of them wholeheartedly which is rare for me to be able to do. May God bless you to read this and know the love with which it is written and shared."
4,practical and aesthetically pleasing,These baskets came with a wooden bookshelf when I bought them. I put them in my living room and store musical instuments in the bottom one and dvds in the 2 smaller ones. It is a good way to stay organized and contribute to the ambiance of the room.
4,as advertised,"The baskets are pretty much as advertised. A little redder than I had hoped, but they are very, very sturdy, which was my main focus. I like the long, skinny basket--not an easy size to find. Overall the sizes are perfect for what I needed them for."
4,"Good quality, bad descripting","These baskets are very sturdy and hold everything that I needed them for, but they are not espresso colored. They are pretty close to what the picture shows and in my mind that is not dark/deep enough to be considered espresso. Other than that these are a good perchase. Although if I was to change anything about them is to line the bottom with felt so that when they slide in and out of the shelves they are in they don't scrape along so bad. They are pretty rough, and will dammage a fine finished shelf."
1,Sheds and Falls Apart,"After a few months of use, the wicker on these falls apart and falls to the floor. It sheds and makes a mess - every basket has done the same thing. They are not made well. Even the wicker around the handles is falling apart. Save your money."
2,"Ok baskets, overpriced.","Baskets were ok. Scratchy surface with sharp wicker strands poking out when I opened the box. Very thin wicker - I wouldn't necessarily call them ""sturdy,"" I'd calm them ""firm"". Cosmetically, they look nice, and I wouldn't mind having them decorating my apartment...but not for this price."
3,fine- but not perfect.,I bought these to go on the winsome shelve they are advertised with. The large basket is too large for the winsome shelve-it fits in the opening- but it rubs against the sides of the shelves- and does not go in and out easily- plus I am sure it will scratch the surface I also thought they were smaller than appears- but that is my fault for not drawing out the dimensions before I bought it- the picture is a bit deceiving on this item. The quality is just OK- I will have to wait and see if they hold up over time and use.
4,storage baskets,Just right size that I needed. I keep toys out all the time for grandkids. The baskets do the job and go with furniture.
2,decent,"these baskets are decent. I have baskets i got from another store which are much nicer and sturdier. the color of my baskets are definitely not espresso. they actually have a pink tint to them. they are not heavy duty baskets. the quality is nice, but i am not sure they are worth the money. i wouldnt recommend them unless you are only using them for storage."
3,Nice baskets but don't buy their shelves!,I bought these baskets and a Winsome Wood shelf separately. The baskets are nice and sturdy but the shelf is junk! I would not recommend any of this companies wooden products. I am astonished at the poor construction and difficult assembly of the shelf I purchased.
2,Color is wrong,The ones I received are a bright Cherry Red. They are just ok as far as quality. But... red?
3,okay but not sure how long they will last,cute but not sure they will last. the price to me was okay - maybe look for something else - they seem cheap and look cheap to me
4,Glad I found these,"These were exactly the size that I needed for my rattan storage unit. So this worked out perfectly for me. Quality is good, not highest, but for the price and my particular needs they were fine. Would recommend to a friend."
3,jazz can be murder!,"Man, I thought the scene was competitive here in Melbourne! This is fun - I wish there was more Tubby in it."
4,Dave Brubeck and Charlie Mingus,"The Opening credits list this as A Rank Organisation, Bob Roberts Production. The movie is something in which Jazz buffs will be interested. It has a ""Peter Gunn"" feel throughout. In the forefront are some great Jazz riffs by such notables as Dave Brubeck, Charlie Mingus, Johnny Dankworth and Tubby Hayes. Richard Attenborough is listed and has a smallish role. Patrick McGoohan has a larger role and accomplishes this with a star turn. Keith Mitchell also has star power. Paul Harris is stellar, but the unsung heroes of this UK produced ""Jazz thriller"" based loosely on Othello are Brubeck and British trumpeter Bert Courtley. McGoohan closes the film with some pretty solid drumming, but we all know how that was done, yet he looks the part. It is taken straight from VHS to DVD with no digital improvements."
4,Fast short Kelton Read....,"I enjoyed this Kelton read as I have the others, but there seems something is missing in this short book. It was set later in the 1890's a little past the old west in Texas. Since something was missing perhaps it was the background and some of the colorful old west such as indians, settlers, more cowboys, cattle, and so on. All in all still a fair story and as all of Keltons books a good story to be told. If you are looking for a quick read this won't take you long to get through! Story is based on two friends and and how one mistake and a brush with the law can haunt you for the rest of your life-so some great lessons to be learned. Again if your looking for more of a true western I would pick up one of Keltons other great books, especially if you are a first time reader of his."
5,Everything you've always wanted to know about Ice Cream,"This is by far the most complete book about ice cream I've ever seen. It's ideal for both adults and kids with fun facts. For example, here's one of the entertaining Did You Know? entries: ""In Newark, New Jersey, it is illegal to eat ice cream after 6 P.M. without a doctor's note."" The ice cream making tips and recipes make it a wonderful resource for an activity the whole family can enjoy at home or you can visit top ice cream parlors in the U.S. Check out the state-by-state listings included in ""Everyone Loves Ice Cream."" You'll happily refer to it again and again."
5,Chili Kit was awesome,"My dad was actually the one that told me about the chili kit and instead of looking in stores, I bought it here. It was delivered fast and the spice packet did wonders for my chili!"
5,How did I do SMD work without these?,They have made doing SMD soldering at home from a chore to a wonderful experience. Expensive and worth every penny.I've found that I use the straight version of these more than these curved ones. But there are certain situations where these are indispensable. I'm glad I have both.
4,Loved it,This book presents a good argument for why america turned right during the 60s and 70s ... I found it both interesting and informative. I would def. reccomend this book to anything interested in us history. i had to read this for a college history class and i honestly loved it
2,A Slow Right Turn,"I was forced to read this for an American History class. It has been my least favorite book that I have read in my entire college experience. Although it is a very detailed book, the conclusion at the end was very useful to sum up the jibber-jabber of the rest of the book. It was a little bit wordy, yet it did contain a lot of information about each of the presidents and how they contributed to the American economy and society and why America started to beome more conservative. Not a bad book for college professors to give to their students (information wise), but I would not read it on my own for pleasure (unless you like to put yourself to sleep)."
1,Time out!,"My opinion is very poor. Sadly, this is not my super movie. I do not rec. A big nr. What is my reason. Plot is weeeeeek, but wait there is more. People who want a comedy will not find one. Also, it is not an action movie. However, this movie is a great vehicle to destroy your cinema career."
3,Good for young kids to hold their videos in,While the inside sheets are a little flimsy this disc holder is great for little kids to hold their movies in.
3,decent for the price,"not very loud at all. I got it because 1 side of my old Iphone speakers blew out so it will help save that 1 remaining speaker. Not as loud as my new Iphone speakers.Good look. No batteries needed, just plug into headphone jack. Good for use in a very small room."
1,I would not recommend this book,"I think this book is horrible. As written in a prior review, it's missing large segments - riffs, solos etc. Its really strange. On several songs, after the intro the guitar part gets very basic - its clearly not what Stevie's playing, and I agree with the other review, that it looks like it's listing the vocal melody. Most songs also seem to be missing the solo's. I don't know how this one slipped through the cracks at HL. My only guess is on the cover it says ""Easy Guitar"". Which in this case seems to mean leave out everything but the basics. That's the only positive thing I could say - if you're looking for a book that gives you ""a touch of SRV"" maybe this would be good, but even then I think I'd go to a tab site first."
1,For guitar players only,"Being a dedicated SRV fan, I was thrilled to find a book I didn't have about SRV but when I recieved this book, it really isn't a book but a ""how to play SRV songs"" instead which is great if you play guitar but I don't. None of the information available on this book indicated that this is a how to play instead of a book about SRV so be on notice."
5,One of the most entertaining books I've read in a long time,"I would have to rank this book in my top 3 sports books of all time. Not only did Bunevich captivate me with his up close and personal stories of some of my favorite athletes, but he also sheds light on what makes the autograph industry what it is today. His first hand knowledge of the industry made it very enjoyable reading. This is a must have for any sports fan of any age. He talks about his encounters with some of the all time greats like Mantle, Mays and Bradshaw as well as sport icons from todays era such as McGwire, Griffey and Lemieux. You do not have to be an autograph seeker to enjoy this book. I can't stress that enough. I personally have never been into that side of any sport and found this book to be as enjoyable as any sports book I have read."
3,"Small book,...nice pictures","Ok,..I do like this book a lot, but the size of the book is small, and this really is just a small overview of what the title tries to cover. I can see this book idea expanded in a much larger edition by tracking Northern and Southern Calif. artists by each decade."
4,Gide Book in Plein Air Art,"This is a thin book, but it's cover to cover inspiration for the plein air artest, photographer, or folks who just enjoy art. The book is a tour-de-force of California art in the last 150 years, it touches about every thing, the Yosemite Vally, the coastal vistas, the desserts, the city's, in most of the painting styles. Bios of the artists, and the use of writings of California authors, add depth and dazzle to the readers enjoyment.I bought this book used. It's inperfict condition save a lost dust cover. It will not be sitting on my coffee table, it will be in the camper van with the paint, paper blocks, brushes, my field camera, and mud covered boots . A working referance/tool of a California Artest Want-to-be. You can place it on your coffee table or book shelf. However it's best enjoyed open in your hand."
5,Great quality,"I don't use tiny screwdrivers every day, but when I do need them, I found it hard not to strip the screws with the cheap ones I have been using. I did quite a bit of research online and Wiha is one of the major brands the professionals use. Their products are well reviewed all over and this seemed to be one of the most versatile sets for the money. You can spend a lot more on a set that has individual drivers for each size (as opposed to the double sided shafts that fit into the handle that this one has). You can also spend a lot more for a larger variety of sizes, but for the money and for the occasional user, this seems to be the best value in quality mini screw drivers."
3,Good Product,"I liked the product, meets expectations. I wish they could get little cheaper and better quality tools in market. There should b e better way to insert different screw driver tips as its little hazardous"
5,Second set,I'm buying a second set. One for work and one for home. The other brand I have at home are crap yet I paid more then for these Wiha.Agree about the clip but really you can carry the whole set in your top pocket with it not weighing anymore then a Zues reference booklet.The feel of the hardened tool steel oozess quality and the stem is also stamped with there relavent sizes.If this is anything to go buy I can't wait for my large screwdriver set to arrive.AAA recommemed and the priceing is really really good.Thanks and happy screwing.
5,"""SPIRIT OF HIMALAYA"" THREE BOOKS IN ONE!","SPIRIT OF HIMALAYA quickened and lifted me in at least three ways. It's really intriguing as a piece of fiction--suspenseful, interesting and beautifully descriptive. Throughout the pages gems of spiritual wisdom abound. What an easy way to receive some of the highest wisdom on the planet! Besides being a book of great fiction which includes wisdom of many planes, reading this book goes beyond normal impressions; it becomes a really personal experience of extraordinary beauty. The lingering memories are now leading me to read it again and experience its beauty and its wisdom and its subtle refinement again. Anyone would be really fortunate to experience ""SPIRIT OF HIMALAYA""!"
3,Not good for wood floors,"My biggest problem with this is that it's hard for the dog to roll. It just slides over carpet and hardwood floors, which is frustrating for the animal. Dog tries to paw at it to flip it over and her paw just slides off the hard plastic. If my border collie is having issues with it, it's not very well designed. Eventually she gets it roll (usually down the stairs...), but more often she gets bored because there is no reward."
3,"Useful, but noisy","I have an 11 month old Shiba Inu mix. It didn't take her too long to figure this toy out and enjoy playing with it, but I have mostly hardwood floors and it's extremely noisy. Therefore, I don't use the toy as often as I'd like to; it does keep her busy for 15-30 mins which is nice.I wish it was made of rubber, like the Star Mark Everlasting Treat Balls or even the Kong."
2,My dog is annoyed,"My dog is pretty smart for a dog. But he does not get this toy. He seems put off by the loud sounds the hard plastic makes on the floor and from within. It's a great idea for a toy and maybe if we had started him with it when he was a much younger dog, or maybe if it had a softer, quieter outer casing he would have taken to it better."
2,TOO LOUD!,"I purchased this product after reading so many great reviews for it. While it is a great concept, the hard plastic is incredibly LOUD- cacophonous ear splitting loud when the dogs play with it on the hardwood floor. We decided to make it a carpet only toy, but the plastic is also very slippery, so the dogs seem to just scoot it around for a few minutes before getting bored and moving on to better more rewarding things- like the kong ball! The kong ball is rubber so it doesn't clatter and bang as the dogs play with it, and even when its empty they still like to gnaw on it from time to time. I don't recommend the buster cube, unless its for using outside in the yard. Its just too loud for indoor use."
2,Hard to use,"I bought this for my large breed dog to use for entertainment. It is VERY difficult for him to get it to tip over. Be aware: it is HARD plastic, with rounded edges. It makes a racket (especially on hard floors) and it is very tough for the dog to tip it over to get the food out. Mostly it scrapes across the floor. In addition to this, there are terrible instructions on use, and it is almost impossible to open up and put food in it in. Even my husband had a really tough time.I seriously wonder if it is has had some major manufacturing change since many of these positive reviews were written.....Don't waste your money. I did not try to return it, as I wouldn't be able to get it clean enough to feel good about returning it.*I purchased the large size red cube"
3,Mileage may vary,"I have 4 shepherd mixes. They figured it out alright. But its not the most popular toy with them. It tends to slide on tile & hardwood flooring instead of tipping to emit food; and only dispenses food when tipped with the hole down. The food may not be evident to the dog till they tip it yet again to uncover it in the hole.Consequently I had to spend a fair amount of time convincing them it didn't just smell like food, but took a while longer for them to be able to turn it enough times to figure out that was what it took to get food out. Since it slides around, generally I can't find it without a search of the house because they carry it far & wide to find a surface they can tip it over on.While its fairly strong hard plastic, I don't know how it will fair when pushed down stairs onto hard concrete or tile; it may well break then. So I'd rate this as environment dependant for proper function."
3,Riley loves it,"But I do not. My dog loves this toy, but she also takes both of her front paws and slams it against the wall. It's loud and will probably do some damage at some point. If you have carpet, this may make a difference."
3,Buster cube not for lazy dogs...,I love the concept by my dogs just are not that into it. It is difficult to rotate the treat door and separate the toy for cleaning and loading but I feel it needs to be tight enough to resist a dogs constant prodding. If the dogs liked it and used it at all I would have given it a higher rating. It does take a small bit of training to let the dogs understand that they will be rewarded for knocking the cube around enough (adjustable reward effort set by changing the size of the opening in the cube center). My dogs do 'get it' but they are just not that into food. They love to play but you cannot throw that hard plastic cube around your house. One day they might find it interesting...
5,I'd call it an enrichment tool rather than a toy.,"With my past 5 dogs, 3 (updated 9/2/09) learned to work the Buster Cube, and 2 were either not smart enough or not food motivated enough to figure it out.For the three dogs that learned how to work the Buster Cube, food time was and is a challenging delight. The challenge is that not only does the dog have to spin the cube, he or she has to keep it in the middle of the room so that it doesn't get caught up in furniture.Compared to wild dogs, our pets live relatively boring and unchallenged lives. The fact is, a wolf's brain is 1/3 larger than a same sized dog. The Buster Cube requires a bit of hunting type behavior collecting the kibble pieces as they scatter, and where the dog has to work for its meal and make constant adjustments and judgments while doing so.The concentration and joy in a dog's face while working the Buster Cube is priceless. If your dog is a smart ""chow hound"", do it and you a favor and try this."
4,My dog loves the buster cube,"I got the buster cube a few months ago for my pitbull puppy. he loves it! it took him a little while to get the hang of it. I had to push it around to show him how it works but once he got it, he pushed it around everywhere. it is a bit loud and can get stuck in corners but worth it! it will keep the dog busy for a while. i recommend it!"
4,Very loud,"This toy is a lot of fun for my dog, and she likes it when I put Goldfish in it. Pieces of dog food kibble aren't quite as intriguing to her. The only downside is that our house is tiled and the cube is hard plastic. It is so loud when she gets into it that you literally can't hear the TV over her playing!"
3,not for every dog,"I got this for my dog to play with and I have mixed feelings about it. First, the ball is made of hard plastic so when the dog rolls it around and the treats clatter around inside, it is SUPER loud. Second, the plastic is slick and my dog has a really hard time rolling it over because it just slides across the carpet when she pushes it and it's difficult for her paws to get a hold on it to turn it over. It's pretty big - about seven inches wide or so. It's very easy to get the treats into it and if you have a super-active dog who would like to play with it outside, this toy would be great."
3,"Wonderful feeding tool, but difficult to clean","This is a wonderful toy! I have a 4 month old puppy who keeps himself highly entertained for around 20 minutes with his cube.I can handle it being noisy, but my only complaint is that it's hard to clean the interior. That's why it's 3 stars instead of 4 or 5. The instructions tell you to turn and pull the center piece, but I haven't been able to do so and my neighbor who has a mini cube also hasn't been able to pull it out. I've stopped using it until I can find a way to clean the interior."
3,Too Bad,"Too Bad it cannot be opened so you can clean the inside of the cube. My dog loved this cube but the residue from the kibbles eventually builds up and starts to smell rancid. I ended up having to throw it away. If they could make it so you can clean it, it would have definitely gotten five stars."
1,Wouldn't recommend,I couldn't get the center cylander out. I filled it but it was very noisy when I showed my dog how to use it. She won't. I didn't realize it was hard plastic; I thought it was a softer plastic.
3,Busted Too Quickly :(,"1 year old lab Labrador puppy busted this right down the middle! I think less from the chewing, and more from how he likes to pick it up and throw it at the ground. He's violent! Was awesome before the break, but the two pieces just aren't glued together well enough to withstand the violence."
5,As engaging and durable a dog toy as we have found,"Very sturdy plastic, has stood up well to being batted around on concrete and grass. Easy to load, easy to rinse out. Depending on your tolerance, I wouldn't recommend for indoor use due to excitement and noise factors. Didn't notice any difference when dialed in to the ""easy"" or ""difficult"" settings. Our dog (lab/pit) can typically empty 98% of the food from the cube in 15-20 minutes. Overall, great addition to your toy collection."
5,Best toy we have found for our 9 month old lab!,"Our 9 month old lab has destroyed every toy we have given her. We have tried the so-called indestructible toys, but this is the only one that can stand up to our lab. She figured the toy out immediately, and when it gets up against furniture or a wall she knows she has to pull it back with her paw. It is square and doesn't roll well, but this makes it more challenging for highly intelligent breeds that figure things out quickly. She needed the extra stimulation. Also, the square shape keeps her from getting a jaw crushing grip on it. She can pick it up with her teeth, but she cannot get the leverage she needs to destroy it. The hard plastic material is perfect for our aggressive chewer. Buy this toy if you too have had terrible luck finding something your dog can't destroy."
3,Only for Carpeted floors,"If you have hard floors (tile, laminate, wood, low pile carpet, etc) this is not a good toy for your dog. All it does is slide around and frustrate the dog. On plush carpet, it works pretty well."
2,"Great idea, not so great execution","The Buster Food Cube is a great idea for slowing dogs down when eating. It is like a big puzzle to dispense kibbles as rewards. It has a clever settings system to make it easier or harder for your pet. I really wanted this to work, but I'm afraid the shape and slick plastic material used renders it almost unusable for our dog. There are not good gripping surfaces for the dog to get hold of. It is also hard to roll around a cube, especially a slick one. Of course the hard plastic shape is loud on wood or tile surfaces, again, making it difficult to roll over.I applaud the concept but our dog gave it two paws down. Maybe large dogs will have better luck with it."
3,Good concept if you dog figures it out.,"The cube is filled with dog food and/or treats. The idea is that the dog is supposed to roll the cube around to get the food/treats out of the cube. There is a tube with a hole it in to restrict the rate at which treats fall out of the cube. The idea is to make your dog work for his food, which will keep him from getting bored.My dog knows there is food in the cube, and he wants the food. If I put the cube tube side down, he will flip it over and eat the food, then stick his tongue in the hole to get as much out as possible. After that he gives up. Apparently working the cube is instinctive for some (herding?) dogs. It looks like I'll have to teach my dog how to use the cube..."
4,NOT dishwasher safe..but a great toy!,"We are buying our third for our dog. (First one was chewed up as our doggie figured out how to get the center piece out!) This purchase is due to the fact that the second one melted in our dishwasher (the interior). IT IS NOT DISHWASHER SAFE. Otherwise, it is a fantastic toy!"
2,Good Concept - needs improvement,"In concept it is a good idea but in practice there is some work needed. Neither my husbands nor I have been able to open it to clean and as such I stopped using it. I also believe that this is not a toy for big dogs inside the house. Dogs really enjoy it, yes; however the hard plastic is extremely loud, slides on hardwood floors and gets caught under furniture and dog just plows through it to get to it.Update: Took the cube to the pet store and they were unable to open it as well. As a matter of fact we did try 3 other cubes in stock and were able to open only 1 of them. A better option in my opinion is the Omega Paw Tricky Treat Ball."
3,The toy that keeps on giving...,"Our dog loooooves this toy, and it keeps her entertained for much longer than any other toy. While she really enjoys it, the piece in the center that is supposed to come out for easy access to fill it, does not come out easily, or without causing a bit of pain to the fingers. It still works, but it's a minor annoyance. It's also very loud, if your dog is anything like ours, but she runs it around slamming it into walls and finds it most entertaining to play with it on tiled, rather than carpeted floors. Your dog might be more gentle.All in all it's worth it because she likes it."
4,From labs to Yorkies,"We originally got our buster cube for the labrador retrievers that crossed our threshold (my family used to raise guide dogs). Our family dog never caught on to how to use the toy, but we kept it around. We now have a Yorkie that's very insistant on what he wants, and one day, he wanted the buster cube. Now, keep in mind, this was a buster cube meant for a labrador retriever, not for our ""teapot"" (larger than average) Yorkie. But he loves it! He whimpers for it when he wants it, and we've recently had to remove it from his vicinity and wash it well so he can't smell it, or else he'll drive us nuts! But it does occupy his time, and it's a great mental exercise for extremely intelligent dogs."
3,Didn't work for my dog,"I have a very active American Bulldog weighting about 100 pounds. The Buster Food Cube (5"") didn't last 2 hours. I left the house, and when I came back, the cilinder in the middle of the Cube was already removed and crushed by my dog. I'm not dissapointed actually, because the maker of the toy is not claiming that the toy is undestructible, that's why I'm not giving a bad review. Also I have to say that when I gave my dog the toy he reacted happily and inmediately got the idea and started pushing and throwing the toy. I'd say this is a toy for a more quiet dog."
2,Way too noisy,"There's a lot of scratching and pawing at this cube which is hard plastic so it is very very noisy. As with other food cube toys, it is also difficult / impossible to clean. Once you get water in it, it's impossible to get it out. You have to throw away the ball otherwise I'm sure it's a wet dark haven for bacteria."
2,Dog destroyed it,"My 10 month old Great Dane puppy loved it for about 3 weeks, then figured out that she could stick her lower jaw in the hole and rip the core out by holding the rest of the cube with her paws. I don't know if a smaller dog could have pulled that off, but once she got the core out the whole thing was ruined within a minute."
2,Noisy toy,"We feed our dog exclusively from food puzzles and treat toys to keep him entertained. This toy has a good concept but could use a redesign. It was SO noisy with the kibble rolling around in there and due to it's shape, it didn't roll easily so our dog would just slide it around and bang it into the walls forcefully. He was probably having fun with the challenge but we just couldn't handle how loud it was. Plus it's really hard to open the middle. I was bummed out to return it to the store because it's a nice idea, especially with the ability to adjust the difficulty level.Perhaps our dog just wasn't clever enough to figure out how to get this cube to roll and make the treats fall out, but even if he did, the kibble rattling around in there would still be too noisy."
3,WILL NOT STICK,"to the side of my stainless steel sink. I still use it by letting it rest on the bottom. Because the sink is slanted it still drains and keeps the sponge from being soggy, but it's not optimum."
3,"Does not work on stainless steel sinks, but it dries the sponges well","The suction cup sponge holder does not stay attached to my stainless steel sink. I took some Vaseline and applied it to the inside of the suction cups to keep the seal and that seemed to have done the trick. It no longer falls (at least for the last two weeks). I would not recommend this for stainless steel sinks, perhaps it would be better suited for porceline?Other than the suction cups, it is a good product. Allows the sponge to dry thoroughly."
2,look cheap!,I don't like this because It's too small and look cheap. I can get it somewhere else with cheaper price.
2,serves its purpose but rusts already,"This caddy serves the purpose of holding a sponge and a liquid dishwashing soap. Nice look in our sink but it only lasted 2 weeks before rusting. Suction seems ok as mine held its place in the stainless sink and our granite counter top. If you are looking for a stainless one, this is not it. Just spend more and look for a stainless one."
2,where is it?,I am sure the product is great but I can't tell you that for sure. This was supposedly in stock and it seems that they might (not a certainty) have shipped it 10 days after I placed the order.
3,Small,Thought this would have been a tad bigger. Would have wanted something longer and somwhat deeper. Anyway it will still work for my sink.
4,Like this product very much,"I like this product very much. It keeps the wet sponges from laying in the sink or on the counter, can hold soap as well."
5,Just what I wanted!,"This works great. It slid down the side of the sink the first couple of days I had it on, but I left it lower on the sink side and haven't had it fall off in months."
1,Product sucks... but not in a good way,"I should have known better than to get a product that uses suction cups. The cups, despite being moistened, didn't hold against smooth and cleaned tiles or porcelain. Couldn't even stay stuck for 12 hours.Also, the design is poor as the suction cups are located too low and therefore the rack will tilt forward rather than stay parallel to the wall's surface.Too cheap to return but hopefully someone else will learn from my experience and avoid."
2,"great looking, but . . .","I have looked what seems like EVERYWHERE for something like this - - several reviewers complained about the suction cups not working, but several said they worked GREAT - -soooo - - I bought this and it's HORRIBLE! it will NOT stay stuck to my stainless sink!!! so why even use it??"
2,"very nice, except it won't stay up;","A lovely sponge holder, which won't stay atattched to stainless steel sink.. it is sitting on top of sink, with a sponge in it; not what i had in mind."
1,It doesn't stick,"Wanted to love it, but the suction cups don't work. It doesn't hold up the weight of a sponge, it slides off my stainless steel sink."
2,suction fails,"one suction cup constantly fails. Cleaned it and SS sink many times. Other cup works, so must be cup flaw."
4,Does the Job,This caddy works as expected. The suction cups hold securely to the side of my stainless steel sink. The basket can hold 2 normal sized sponges and there have been no signs of mildew that occur on some of the plastic holders.
3,Frida keychain,"its a very nice thing to own if you as big of a frida kahlo fan as i am. one one thing to add to the collection. its great to have this key chain, the only reson i didn't give it a full 5 stars is because its not the original paininting, when i got it i notice that the top of it was missing the original song that it has. The original painting has a little song written on top the key chain does not. And its also not that much of a good quality ive drop it twice and it has fallen apart, you can easily put it back together but its a hassel and you do worry the little papers inside might get lost and then your left with nothing. But if you love frida, its worth it."
5,This is my favorite novel,"Unlike Dickens' tuburcular heroines, Denise, who indeed suffers what Zola called ""poverty in a black silk dress,"" is plucky, and she ultimately breaks the glass ceiling in her own gentle way. She encounters sexual harassment and somehow triumphs. She is a modern woman, perhaps European literature's first truly modern heroine ever.This book is one of the best ever written, bar none, and it is light years ahead of its time."
2,Chemical smelling,"My dog likes them, but they have a nasty chemical smell that I guess is supposed to be ""beefy"" or smoky. I can't even stand to be in the same room as them."
4,"good, but","I like this but they could either provide better details on what antenna wire is needed or included one in the boxworks well, did what I nedded it to do"
5,Great Biography,This book is a really good Biography for young children. If you are looking for a book that is age appropriate - this one is it! I especially appreciated the depiction of the Klu Klux Klan...so often children's biographies leave that part out...and it is reality!
1,Please Amazon be aware!!!!,"This is not an official release, at best a copy from a VHS tape...or a laser disk...."
2,A Boot For Purists,I already had this on DVD from a torrent download site but asked for this as a Christmas gift hoping the picture quality would be better and the small interuption during Comfortably Numb wouldn't be there. Wrong on both counts.
3,Annulment,I have this book but I have yet to read it. Re-marriage is not in my immediate future; but it is good to know that it IS possible
1,Does not suck! Thats the problem!!!,Only used this thing a few times and I can see the dirt blowing out from underneath instead of sucking like it's supposed to do! Do not recommend!!
1,This vacuum sucks....and not in the good way,I bought this vac at Walmart about 10 months ago. It started out great....but now it just doesn't vacuum. The belt is good and the filters are all cleaned. The motor is already weak. I should have spent more for a better vac.
2,It sucks-but not for long.,"This vacuums belt broke the first time i used it. It has a lot of power and cleans well. But, the belt should last much longer than one use."
1,Not great,I got it at WalMart. You get what you pay for. It doesn't have good suction and clogs easily. There's always dust on it. And sometimes it shoots out the clogs. I definatley need a new good vacuum.
1,Waste of money...,"Bought the Bissel powerforce a year ago and it broke a year ago. It lasted a month. I have hard wood floors and area rugs. After reading the reviews I thought it would work for my small condo. Not much to clean so a cheap vacuum should be sufficient. I tried to fix it with their over the phone ""help"". Waste of timeI didn't pay much, but I'd sure like my money back."
1,worst ever,"Everyone loves a brand new vaccuum, but the real test is time. This piece of junk is poorly designed, difficult to clean and now doesn't vaccuum at all. I'm pretty savvy at mechanical repairs, and every single time I want to vaccuum, I have to take the dirt reservoir apart, clean the filters, unclog the hose (which as far as I can tell clogs up because of the big bend at the top of the hose - it's too long and circuitous). I borrowed a friend's little Dirt Devil (more than two years old now) and the comparison is astounding. That's what I'm getting next."
3,WHO KNEW ????,"I was so happy to read good reviews about this vacuuum cleaner...thought I'd really done my homework ! Yes, it's lightweight and is very powerful. I cleaned my whole house, stopping 3 times to clean the filter cup, really wasn't a problem. I was in the last room, cruisin' right along when poof ! The belt broke............. fisrt time out of the box. Bummer. I'll be returning it to WalMart tomorrow. Any other suggestions????"
5,Replaced and great!,I got this chain with a pendant. The pendant is great but the chain is not new. It has a silver wire connecting the clasp to the rest of the chain. I do not think this will do with the weight of the pendant. I hope that the company will assist me with this problem.Silver Insanity did replace the chain and its working out much better for me. The box chain is very sparkly and elegant. I like it.
2,You need every spice ever created to use this!,"I am an American woman married to an Indian man. ""Amma"" is talked about so much that I thought this book would be great. And the pictures DO look great, but I never have all the ingredients to make more than a handful of the recipes! I have a lot of Indian spices at home, but this calls for weird spices that I've never even seen in Indian grocery stores.The recipes are not difficult, but as I said, the ingredient list is exhaustive. I would not recommend this book unless you have obscure spices in your kitchen (this goes WAY beyond cardamom, turmeric, and cumin!!!)"
2,Useful but frustrating,"I only used the GRE review because that is the test in which I am interested. The Kaplan Deluxe Edition is a good tool for reviewing for it in the information it provides, but it is also very frustrating to use. There are videos that play whenever one goes to do a lesson or review that cannot be skipped or turned off. So, something that would take 15 seconds to read takes 2 minutes for a silly video to play. Therefore, the program can be very time consuming to do a simple review. Also, some information is repeated over and over again, with one being unable to skip it. The first video that gives a tour of the program states that the GRE is more difficult than the SAT because the person taking it is now college-educated; however, the program is not designed with a college-educated person in mind. It seems to be designed for entering junior high, with ""fun and exciting"" graphics and clips.Overall, the information in it is useful, but I would recommend getting a book."
1,Sub-Par,"I bought this and am quite frustrated with it. As has been mentioned there are silly/slow cartoons that you must watch everytime. In addition many parts of the program are broken and there is no patch to fix this. For example, the sound cuts in and out randomly. Also on some of the practice tests you cannot check your answers to learn what tricks were used to solve them, even though you should be able to, thr program gets confused and does not allow one access."
1,Read me before purchasing Kaplan,"This is the first software program I've purchased from Kaplan and I would not recommend it to anyone. I will never purchase another Kaplan program. Although the information is valuable, the program is poorly written. It is VERY slow, and the program doesn't allow you to move forward quickly or skip any sections. You must sit through the entire lesson along with all of the annoying jokes, just to get to one point that you want to refresh. Also there is no way to stop during a lesson or test. You must close down the program. And often, only half of the test or game shows on the screen, if it starts at all. You must keep restarting the program until the test begins properly. You're better off finding different software for this program."
5,Great for Practice,I used this set for the GMAT prep. The practice tests are very helpful and it has everything that the books have but a lot more fun. The tests are more accurate I think then the Kaplan book tests and are the same ones that come with the Kaplan book CD-ROM but you get a lot of extra practice. It has a diagnostic that tells you what you need to work on and it even has games!
1,I got ripped off,"Overall, I lost $20 on this purchase because the manufacturer - Encore - did not provide the key to install the cd. Their customer support is non-existent - no phone number - just an email address. I was lucky to receive a cryptic email response back telling me to send back the CD, however they still have not provided a return address. Urrghh!"
4,A novel idea,"I loved the book. I was surprised at how closely the movie adaptations had stayed true to Boulle's original concept. Also so note worthy is the wonderful translation from French to English that manages to keep in tact the authors wit and charm. The novel reflects our ethical and moral short comings in satirical fashion, which were the critical elements that made the movies so memorable. I highly recommend this book, for its time, it is truly an original piece of work."
2,A disappointment,"I had such high hopes when I began reading this book. The story itself is excellent. The idea of having a planet that's inhabited by apes where humans are the animals is indeed an interesting plot. The problem with the book is that while the plot is interesting, the way the story is told is not. I found myself thinking ""when is this book going to end?"" The only redeeming quality of the book is the last part. This was much less interesting than the movie."
2,snooze,"I never liked the movie, except for the statue of liberty scene at the end, which isn't even in the book. I'd hoped the book might be better, but I found it equally uninteresting. French astronauts surrender to the ape society. Wake me when it's over."
4,Very good book !,"I've read that book in French, and I loved it ! This is not a classical SF book, it is an amazing philosphical tale about the future of the human being. The roles are completely changed, for the human being on this planet is like an ape on Earth : considered an animal. It is easy to read that book. I've read other books by Pierre Boulle, that are as brilliant - never common."
4,Planet of the Apes,"This is a very well-written book that astonishes my mind. I had first seen the movie before I read the book and it is amzing to me what the writers of it came up with. A world where apes ruled over humans is just amzing to me. In fact, I would be suprised if there were any other kinds of species that ruled humans on any other planet. Reading the book about apes who were more technologicaly advanced and knowledgable than humans is just amzing to me."
4,Apes rule the planet!,"In the future three astronauts land on a unknown world. Very much like Earth, the world has lush forests, breathable air and a temperate climate. It even has cities, roads and farm land. But after landing they found a terrifying truth - humans are savage beasts and apes are the masters of the world.Everybody compares the book to Gulliver's Travels. I have to agree but that is as far as it goes. The book feels slightly dated - the science fiction is too simple. All Pierre does is replace humans with apes. We barely get a feel of the culture, history or nature of the civilized apes. But the book is not a true sci-fi novel. It was meant to be a mirror, to reflect human stupidity back onto the readers.It's fun in it's own way - but I still had to drop a point."
3,"Very Jules Verne, and not it a good way","With all the media hype out I decided to return to the source and get the straight picture. I was disappointed with this novel on a few levels. First it is obvious that Boulle was heavily influenced by his follow French countryman Jules Verne. The hero is a reporter like so many Verne novels. However Boulle does not seem to be able to pull off the adventurous story telling of Verne. The storyline IS intriguing, and one feels the conflict when the hero chooses the civilized ape life and turns his back on the human savages. But we are treated to many simplistic plot advancments like when he lets the apes know he is a rational being. I also found the ""deus ex machina"" of the human brain scan to reveal the planets history to be very weak. Liked the intro with the two space travelers in the solar sailor, best science part of the whole book."
4,GET YOUR DAMN PAWS ON THIS BOOK!!!,"I could never have imagined how different the original book is from the movie. A few examples: 1.The hero is a french journalist not an American astronaut. His sensibilities are decidedly un-Heston-esque. 2.The gorillas are more a force to be reckoned with, not only becuase of their brute power but because they are the most organized. While the other apes,the scientists,scholars etc. are busy debating and postulating, the gorillas just go out and get things done. They are the most effective administrators. 3.The satire in the book hits the same targets as the movie,(Science,Religion,Gov't,Academia) it just hits harder. 4.The book is funnier than the movie, but the villains are just as menacing. 5.Zaius isn't the top dog! A shocking revelation to be sure, but there is an ape even more highly placed than Doc. Z!They're both very good. I was happy to find out that I could enjoy the movie and the book independantly of each other."
3,3 Stars,"I hate to say it but the movie is better than the book. My memories of reading the novel as a kid were rosy were nostolgia. Rereading it now, it remains high concept. What a great idea! But the story itself is fascinating but rather thin, light, and clunky at the same time. Much better is his Bridge Over The River Kwai, which he seemed to take more seriously."
4,Interesting ideas,"If you've seen the movies, you don't really know the book. Some of the basic concepts are there, but it is quite different.A small group of astronauts travel to a far away planet and run into something they didn't expect to find. Humans with animal instincts. Apes wearing modern clothes (for the time period the book was written - early 1960s) and driving cars. The humans destroy the astronauts' ship, leaving them stranded on this unusual world.I can't really discuss much more without the risk of making a spoiler.The book goes very quickly and doesn't really dwell on details. For me, the final ending involving those reading the story was predictable. It's still an enjoyable book. As with much sci-fi, social themes are hidden within the fictional situations. The point of this one was fairly clear, but I also knew about the themes before reading the book. The book was discussed some in Behind the Planet of the Apes."
3,So-so book; don't expect the movie,"I read the book after I had seen the ""Planet of the Apes"" movie so that may color my opinion. The book is a bit more realistic than the Heston movie in that the apes don't speak a human language. Other than that nice touch, though, the book is really just a so-so sci-fi adventure. It was enjoyable, but I'm glad that the motion picture company that did the movie didn't stick to the book that much. The rule is that the movie is NEVER better than the book, but ""Planet of the Apes"" is the exception to the rule."
3,GOING APE!,"I love the original movie with Charleston Heston! So, I will not share my views (which are not necessary) on the remake with Marky Mark. The book is dated in certain expressions and descriptions. But, overall it is a good story. I did find the amount of violence and technology to be above what was visualized onscreen. Nova 's role was more significant than the theatrical version. Nova was more subdued and less interesting than in the book. I wish they would have kept the first time Taylor discovers Nova! I won 't spoil it. But, it is engaging when read!I did feel that the end was surprising and yet cheated at the same time. I would have felt better if the end was unknown or left to the reader 's imagination. But, it is worth reading and I am glad I own it.GET YOUR STINKIN PAWS/HANDS ON THIS BOOK AND READ IT!"
5,An astonishing body of work.,"Each of the novellas in CITY OF SAINTS AND MADMEN independently is an utter gem...but to have them contained under one cover is to truly appreciate the idiosyncratic genius of VanderMeer. In this presentation, his darkly fantastical city of Ambergris is allowed to fully crystallize in our imaginations, and take on a truly persuasive sense of reality, however surreal the occurences within its borders. VanderMeer's Ambergris novellas are thrillingly original, literate and funny, frightening and moving. THE TRANSFORMATION OF MARTIN LAKE might be my favorite of these offerings, but one would be hard pressed to choose. This reader gives CITY OF SAINTS AND MADMEN his highest recommendation!"
4,An interesting little story with a quirky twist.,"I think Jeff Vandermeer is more popular in Europe than the United States. I have to admit he is a very good writer who can sure turn a phrase. He has a wry sense of humor and a quirky style. That said, City of Saints and Madmen was a hard book for me to get into, mostly because I prefer a more action oriented style in my fantasy. Still a good work, and its popularity shows its worth. The characters were interesting in a quirky way, and I would recommend the book to anyone who likes their fantasy to be a strange vision in a world of dreams."
2,Good idea/poor execution,"Not only that but it was written inexpertly and with much emphasis on a sort of phoniness which made me cringe as i read. This book is intentionally aimed towards a subculture obsessed with Victorian era curios, thinly-veiled Lovecraftian reference, and fresh water squid. If any of that sounds like your cup of tea then by all means buy this book. Personally the writing style made me feel like I was reading a history of a place too far removed from my world. The hints were vague and the glossary complex. 4/10"
5,Not Your Usual Kettle of Squid,"I have no doubt that this uncategorizable collection will emerge as one of the finest (and most unusual) books of the year. This beautifully-produced hardcover edition contains a wealth of new material not included in the trade paperback, including the magnificent weird horror of ""The Cage"" and the delightfully strange mock-academic monograph ""King Squid."" You're not likely to read another book this year that ranges so effortlessly from horror to farce, all seasoned with a sly postmodernism that is playful rather than pedantic.This is fantastic fiction for people who like Nabokov as well as Tolkien, Borges as well as Lovecraft. Smart, funny, self-aware, wonderfully imagined, and beautifully written, this book is a marvelous example of what fantasy can aspire to and what it can achieve."
4,Mostly madmen,"I have read only the short novel DRADIN IN LOVE which forms part of this book set in the city of Ambergris. The hero Dradin is an irrationally optimistic ex-missionary who against all odds survives - though not unscathed - his love affair with a woman seen in a distant window. The basic plot was used by E. T. A. Hoffman, but the locale and characters and actions are much better done here than in the translations of Hoffman I have read - though the movie version done in England in the 40s is excellent."
2,It was OK,"I dont' want to be harsh on this book because it is quality fantasy. In other words, it's not of the epic fantasy genre. The biggest problem was that I never fully grasped Ambergris. Its like Ambergris was a giant painting and I only saw small slices of it. It feels more like a hastilly published companion piece to a successful novel that takes place in Ambergris. The stories themselves didn't stand out to me. Martin Lake was my favorite story but I found it predictable in some ways and thus a let down. Drabin, in Love was OK but not exceptional. And Mr X was poor. The early history was good but it needed something more to go with it than the 3 other stories."
5,"Excellent, but I wish it were longer","Really enjoyed this book, Jeff has a wild and coherent imagination. Only wished the book contained the stories I later learned were only available on the extended edition.I suppose in the end I'll end buying the other and give my copy to a friend who also appreciates good literature."
4,Good solution if there isn't a custom mount,"First off, I'll say that I love Peerless projector mounts in general. They are well built, clean looking, and easy to use.The universal mount is no exception. It's a little flimsier than the custom mounts. While the custom projector mounts (drilled specially for each projector model) is basically just a flat piece of steel with the appropriate attachment points, the universal mount is a bit like a spider, which allows adjustments for basically any projector. This is great as it will fit anything, but the downside is that you have these arms that attach and cause weak points. Nothing drastic mind you, but enough for a bit of a wobble when adjusting the alignment.If you can get a custom plate for your projector, do it! If you're unlucky and bought one that doesn't match, the universal mount fits the bill!"
3,Another dance routine,"This is a good workout, but in the end it's just another dance routine. I have bad knees and this will just make them worse."
1,What is This?,"I'm no Calloway officianado but I'd say this is easily the worst album in my entire collection. In fact, it is so disappointing I'm heading immediately to a record store to trade for something else. I thought Cab Calloway was a singer. The first 5 tracks I've listened to don't have any singing-- most notably Viper's Drag and Happy Feet. What's the point? I expect that most newcomers to Cab Calloway will be sorely disappointed with this one. Oh yeah, and the sound quality of the last third of the album is terrible. Unless you're trying to impress someone, save your money, 'cause you're never going to listen to this album again."
1,British Movies,"Beware when ordering British movies. Make sure the movie has been convereted to play on USA DVD systems. When I ordered this movie ""Hell Drivers"" from Amazon, it was not made clear that the movie had a Region 2 format i.e. it can only be played in England. Foreign movies must have a Region 1 format to be playable in the USA. I paid $50 for a movie that cannot be played in the USA!"
3,"Sharp, yes, but handles are rough","I like how the knives cut, but I don't care for the roughness of the handles. They are not pleasant to the touch."
2,light,"sharp knifes with flexible blades.wood handle is little bigger than knife insert,so it feels flimsy and you might even get a little wood splinterif you are not careful."
1,Deeply Flawed,"This game had great potential, the graphics and sound are awesome. That's really the only positive thing I can say about it. The game seems to be buggy on Xbox. Every once in a while, when you complete an objective, ""Objective Completed"" flashes acoss the screen. The next objective may not be triggered. Now you've got nothing to do but restart it and hope it lets you move on next time. It will let you eventually if you don't mind repeating the levels over and over. After getting sick of this, I got disgusted and handed it over to my brother to try on his Xbox. The results were the same. Don't waste your money!"
3,Fun fps action,This is a fun game there is not much bad I can say about it has a good story not great but good. Controls could be better and there a few bugs here and there but it's a solid game and fun can't forget that FUN that's all I've got. Almost forgot Henrey Rolins play's mace not sure how he got the job but he does a good job to OK that's all I've got. I think?
5,Intriguing!,"Hidden in a Whisper is a great book. I read the entire thing in one day. Never a dull moment. Along with the main plot, there is a mystery too, which makes it even more enjoyable!"
4,romancejunkie,"I like this character in the first book and am glad she wrote the sequel about her. The history of the Harvey Houses is incredible! This is a well written story with romance and intrigue, just the way I like it!"
3,Good beginning,"I started out really liking this book and the writing style of the author, but by the end I really didn't like the main character Jesusa. She seams to be a walking contradiction. She says one thing and then in the next chapter completely says the opposite. I also didn't get why, if she was trained in so many trades, she chose to be a maid. She seemed to be incredibly judgmental of other people yet was hardly a good person herself. Her whole attitude of never needing anybody or asking anybody for anything was ridiculous when you read about all the people that helped her along the way. I do think the book is worth reading, it's just hard to stomach all the self bravado and thinly disguised self pity."
2,plain fare,A real nice Southern woman politely swiped this from maybe books under my nose at a local book sale here in Massachusettes. She marvelled that it was just the best Southern cook book. However I am not impressed.. Some recipes told me to take short-cuts with processed stuff like cake mixes and cans of soup. It should say to put file in the gumbos if it was any good because much better than thyme. The ingredients in their combinations look disappointing or maybe I expect too much of a French influence. Oh well plain cooking has its merits if it was what Ma used to make but if I go to the bother of doing it from a cook-book I expect more.I have the Southern Living annuals that are much better and have more recipes and variety.The binding is a serrated plastic spine so it was easy to tear out pages I did not want and ended up with 1/6 of the book.
3,"Corn picks, good but not great","These corn picks are ok, good, they do the job, but are hard to get in the cob. Once they are in they work good, but it is difficult to get them in"
3,Page turns,"This a valuable anthology and has much to recommend it. The cleaness of the lay-out the use of original language only with a literal and literate translation by Martha Gerhart at the beginning of the of the score and the choice of arias for the young singer are commendable. The inclusion of cadenze and oppure, not found in other collections, is valuable. However, all of the anthologies edited by Larsen have the same problem. Page turns. Larsen is a fine pianist and should know better. I have had many pianists complain about or refuse to play from Larsen scores. Whenever a difficult passage to play occurs it is invaribly on a page turn. The collection is a great study tool, but less than ideal in performance."
5,Excelent!,I really like the fact that you have a translation of all the arias.I wish they had a second and third volume.
4,Good collection for baritones/instrumentalists.,"This is a collection that actually exceeded my expectations since most of the ""good guy' parts in opera are for tenors.Most popular selections would include ""Largo al Factotum"" (the intro. to Barber of Seville), and ""Votre Toast"" (""Toreador Song"" from Carmen"").The English translations provided are quite literal and non-poetic, which seems strange, because some of the selections, including those above, and others such as Mozart's ""Magic Flute"", do have English lyrics and have been performed in English.Also serves as a good source of instrumental solo material for trombone, baritone or cello players."
5,Light Cooking,"I had a yard sale version of this book which I used a LOT. I finally gave it to our son and new daughter-in-law when they married. Boy, did I ever miss it. I was happy to find it online though!"
3,It's Okay.,"The book was published in 1995 and wish I had known that - maybe should have read a bit more on the web site. However, didn't discover that until I received the book and it's a little outdated for me. I would have liked it better if it were a little more up to date on the recipes. There aren't too many that I think I would even try without adding my own take on them."
5,Smooth Cappuccino cooler,We have been using General Foods International Cappuccino Coolers for several years. We have preferred the Coolers rather then the hot versions of Cappiccinos. This brand seems to be the smoothest ones we've found. The types that are available for either cool or warm versions just don't seem to have the flavor of this brand. Soy or regular types of milk can be used to make the coolers with good results. Our favorite flavor has been Hazelnut. We highly recommend this Cappuccino cooler.
5,THE Best Taste and Price,"These are so good that I've had one almost every morning since they were first introduced to the public. Everyone that I offered one to has asked for more. Best of all, they are just as good mixed with rice milk as they were with cow's milk, now that I've become lactose intolerant...I use half a foil envelope per glass, which results in twelve servings per container. Compare the @fifteen cents per serving with $3 or more for drive through cappucinos, which are mostly crushed ice!!! Go on, try it!!! They come in vanilla and chocolate, too. (No, I don't get kickbacks. I'm genuine.))"
3,Good Light cappucino cooler,"If you like a good very light cup of cappucino in the morning then this item is yours. I like dark heavy coffee to wake me up in the morning and this was not the one for me, nothing bad about the product, it good somooth and very light coffee."
4,Yummy for wifes tummy,"Smooth taste with a touch of caffiene. Wife has been drinking it for years to get going in the A.M. Easy on the stomach. Not like cowboy coffee that is so thick that it will hold a fork upright. But, hey, to each their own.** you can have it shipped monthly too."
2,I cannot recommend these,"I just bought 2 packs of these and I wasted my money. I wear a size 11 shoe and these are supposed to be for sizes 6-12. However, they barely make it over my heels. I ended up giving them to someone with smaller feet as they were useless to me."
4,Canon 30D Info Tape,"I purchased the 30D when it first came out. I was fine with it, but watching this DVD explained a few things and showed me a few things that I wouldn't have used on the camera, like the custom functions. The custom function for the set button is great. I now have me set button programed to pull up the ""Picture Style"" menue when I press it. Well worth a look. Even if you just learn one thing it's worth it."
2,"Not much to learn from this book, even for a beginner","The book is 50% watered down information, 50% anecdotes about the author paddling up some river or off the coast of NY or somewhere. Seems to be more oriented towards racing or endurance than just the average person who likes to paddle around. It doesn't have enough information for somebody just starting out, and it has no useful information for an advanced kayaker. Example: He says he's never tried a dry suit, but then goes on to tell you to use a two piece, but that they are probably too hot anyway... As for roll recoveries - he more or less says nobody really does that and it's too hard to explain anyway, so he didn't bother. If you want an excellent book, try ""The Essential Sea Kayaker"" instead. I got both of them at the same time, and The Kayak Companion is probably going on the shelf never to be read again."
4,Good for beginners,"I just took a couple on-the-water classes and this book covers the same techniques taught by our instructor (getting back in a kayak with help from one other person, sweep stroke, crab walk, etc.). It is not an in-depth reference book but I just wanted a book to help me remember what we learned in class and this book serves that purpose."
1,Confusing,"So-so book. It's the first time I've ever wished the heroine would 'get hers'. Elena is a shallow, petty girl who only wants Stefan because she thinks he doesn't want her. She's the typical narcissistic prom queen who usually ends up the first victim. What was the author thinking? I honestly don't find how this book fits in with the others since it says that Damon and Stefan were made vampires in 15th century Italy. In follow-up books, they're supposedly from Mystic Falls and only 170 years old. Very confusing."
3,It was ok,"I'm a little disappointed. I love the TV show and thought I might get some insight into the characters from reading the books. However the characters seem undeveloped, and the relationships that exist between the characters in the show are either nonexistent in the books or shallow and petty. I'm undecided if I'll bother with the next in the series."
1,Don't Waste Your Time...Just Wait for the TV Series,"This book was simply awful. I bought it because I've gotten hooked on the tv series. What a disappointment! Elena is not at all likeable, and she and all the other characters are as flat as dishwater. She falls in love with Stefan over about three pages.Speaking of pages, this book is short - not as in ""short and sweet"", but as in ""it's only the first third of a decent book"". It says it is 300+ pages, but the typeface is HUGE. It is only the first part of a decent book in terms of substance as well. Absolutely nothing happens. Elena meets Stefan and Damon (briefly) and finds out they're vampires. That's it. (Must be the reason the first 2 books are now sold together in some listings.)Having read this book, I have SO much more respect for the tv show. It is a tremendous improvement over the source material. I will just have to be patient and wait for more episodes, because I will not be buying the remaining books in the series."
2,NOT what I anticipated,"There are such good ratings for this book, so I had high expectations. But reading the book, I quickly noticed the author's average style of writing. While I love cheesy romance and vampires, the romance in this book was not realistic enough to be believable. As someone said, it was too ""lovey-dovey."" The main character was somehow annoying. For one, her ""friends"" are more 1-dimensional side-kicks than actual people of free will. It was very dramatic for a slow paced book.Overall, I gave it 2 stars b/c the storyline was at least acceptable."
3,not what i tthought it would be,It had a verry slow start and a lot of rmabling. I did fall in love with the mail charector even though I could not relate to the main charector it is kind of buffyesk. I identified the main character as cordila form the buffy serisbut still liked it. I was up set to find out the third book in the seris is out of print and hard to find. Good seris but don't start reading till you can get all the books.
2,Uh....?,i only read the sample of this. I need to ask: Am I The Only One Who Thinks This Is A Total Twilight Ripoff??
5,I just LUV this quartet!!!!!!!,"I don't own this quartet, but I borrowed it from someone. Although my favorite is The Forbidden Game trilogy (I just totally LUV Julian), this is still one of LJS's best works. And for all you Lisa Jane Smith fans out there, the Vampire Diaries will be reprinted!!!!! THE AWAKENING and THE STRUGGLE will be out March of 1999, and THE FURY and DARK REUNION will be out April of 1999."
5,This Book Is The Best Book I've Read In A LONG Time,This book is the first in the the Vampire Diaries series and is very romantic with a horrific twist. Stefan is the most sensitive one that everyone roots for. I actually wanted Elena to become a Vampire so her and Stefan could go back to Italy. Damon is very mysterios and is the bad guy. He is also the character who is also rooted for a bit because he is so arrogant and handsome. I give this book all 10 stars.
3,Vampire stories,"I have been watching Vampire Diaries on the CW and really like the show. Therefore, I decided to read at least the first book of the series. I really didn't like the book and didn't continue reading the series though I am still watching the show on the CW."
2,"Watch the show, it's better","I won't go on and on about how much I think the writing and the story are not good, because I've read a dozen novels like this. The premise is week, the characters are cardboard cutouts, and nothing really interesting happens. I've been watching the show on the CW from the start and couldn't believe that it was aired -- it's too good. I heard a lot about the book and gave it a try. It was so disappointing, I couldn't believe it. The show makes each character a real person. The book doesn't care to. On the plus side, I finished it, which is unusual for poorly written novels on my end.Word of warning, do not expect the CW characters... this is an entirely different thing altogether. Elena is queen-bee-blonde, her friends are charactures, the vampires are meh, the love story is... wait there was a love story? Ok, I've harped on this enough. Just don't expect the magic of the show in this novel."
5,love it,just love the books. i watch the show but the books give more in to the storie behind the people
4,great,Second time reading it.I still like the Tv series better. Elena is nicer and more compassionate in the show
1,TV is better,"The book is so full of clichés and bad english, it's a miracle they did such a nice job with the TV series !"
5,LOVE THIS BOOK!!!,"I love this entire searies...well the first four. I have yet to read the new stuff since the show came out. However, I would totally recomend this author. The Vampire Diaries and the Secret Circle books are so much fun! They are very easy reads and a perfect guilty pleasure for the young and older adult alike.If you find you also love this book another author you would like that writes supernatural stories is S.B. Stewart. I have read and can reccomendThe Magic WithinandThe Alchemist's Gift (Adventures of Rhonda Lewis). Both are super fun reads with strong female leads and super sexy guys..can you say witches and werewolves!!!"
4,Better than the tv show!,"Unless you live in a cave you already know about the television show, The Vampire Diaries. Well, forget everything you know because, it's true, the books are NOTHING like the show. Okay, not nothing, but the differences outweigh the similarities. I don't know about you, but it worked for me. I watched the first season of the show, most of the time it was exciting enough. During the second season I lost interest as it lost excitement and became more dramatic, and I haven't watched it since.The book didn't do that. It actually left me on the edge of a cliff, needing to continue the story with The Struggle. So, yeah, I definitely recommend reading the book, but I am not recommending the show. Books rule!!"
1,Terrible,"I've always been one of those annoying people who would tell others to ""read the book"" instead of obsess over a show or movie... ALWAYS... Until I read this pile of pathetic.The show is actually 100 times better than the movie. This book offers no substance, a rushed love story with no rhyme or reason as to why Elena loves Stefan and vice verse.Anyhow in the show Elena is sweet, reserved and likeable. In the book, she's a self entitled prom queen, a girl hard to relate to, who is mean to her friends and feels entitled to her men just because she is pretty. Barf.Then you have Stefan, who falls for her and yearns for her... why?I only liked Damon in the book, who is witty, fun, but Elena does not even deserve him as her character in this book.Sadly this one is a joke, and does not stick to the shows plot, thank God for that, or it would have been an awful show."
2,Underwhelmed,"This is one of the rare instances where I actually like the tv version better than the book (99% of the time I think the book is always better than the movie or tv show- this is the exception for me). The best description I can come up with for the book is ""stiff."" Everyone was so ridiculously formal & strained it was almost painful. It was okay, but didn't make me want to keep reading- the characters were very different than the tv show & I can see where it's clearly going to take a different direction in some ways, I just don't think I care."
4,The Vampire Diaries,"I am enjoying the TV series and would love to read the books, but can someone list the books in order? Haven't been successful in finding the list in order so that I can purchase accordingly and follow along. . . Thanks."
5,A divine inspiration,"The Vampire Diaries series awakened desires in me I didn't know I had. I am 18 years old and I first began these books before I as much as started junior high. Every summer I go over these four books again and again. . . and every time something sparks a light inside. . . how cliche, I know, but it's true. I have loved to write since I first learned how to make the letter ""a,"" but The Vampire Diaries made me really desire writing, made me want to keep going. LJ Smith is one of the greatest young adult writers and I hope that she can inspire others the way she did me. If you're looking for a good book, a good series, I beg you to read these! You won't be unsatisfied. Trust me."
4,I'm still hooked.,"I am twenty three years old now, and have loved these books since I stole them from my older sister years ago. They're dark, romantic, and creepy. Now that I'm older I recently reread them, I admit that they sometimes feel like a cheap Anne Rice rip off, but they're still fun. Elena is everything every girl wants to be, brave, beautiful, and smart all rolled into one, she rolls with even the most outlandish punches, and still manages to feel real. Even in the midst of a vampire brother love triangle, you can still relate. She's not always sweet and pure, and the vamp brothers have their issues too but that adds to their charm. This trilogy is totally worth reading, especially if you still find Anne Rice a little tough going. They'll give you the creeps, and make you cry eventually, but always in the best way possible."
4,Pleased with the series...,"The first books I read by L.J. Smith were of the Secret Circle series. I fell in love with those books instantly. A few weeks ago, I read the Vampire Diaries. While I haven't enjoyed the books as much, I still think they're definitely worth the read. I've yet to be disappointed with Smith's work and the Vampire Diaries isn't a letdown in any sense of the word. After Book I, the story really takes off. Book III is a tearjerker so you've been warned. :) All in all, any fan of Smith should check out the series."
2,Not L. J.'s best,"I would have liked this book a lot better if the main character was a more interestingperson than Elena, who seems to be the personification of the stereotypical boy-crazy mallrat teenagegirl. I LOVE vampires, but this is ridiculous. Like when Stefan starts going to high school - oh please. He's hundreds of years old; as if he needs to learn about algebra. School is bad enough when you HAVE to go. Books like this are why I prefer Anne Rice and Poppy Z. Brite, even if Anne *is* getting too religious, and Poppy too violent - at least they don't show the entire world from a teenage perspective."
2,Watch the T.V show,"I tried to read this series and could not get through the second one. I'm a fast reader and love supernatural type books, but I found this series to lack in good story line and strong characters. Compared to her Secret Circle novels the writing was very weak. I however love the song! This is the first time ever I felt that the show/movie was much much better then the books. In fact I loved the show so much that its why I decided to try the books. The show is a must see! The strong has an amazing story line and excellent development!"
5,"The Vampire Diaries, The Awakening WAS A GREAT BOOK!","I first picked up the book because I love Vampire Books. (They Rock! ^.^) At first I thought that it might be one of the cheesy vampire books, where everyone is obsessed with garlic and crosses. However, after reading this book, I was hooked on the series. The plot is excelent, and I'm not going to give it away. Read it for yourself! :P"
1,Vampire diaries,This book was well written and easy to read and very enjoyable. A very nice short story it was very different than the tv series.
4,"Very different from the show, yet just as much drama and excitment","It's a good book so far and I'm about only half way thru. I started reading after looking at many reviews so i went into it knowing that it would be quite different from the show and it is, which is fine. it is difficult to picture elaina with blonde hair, and she is different in her attitude ... she's more shallow and there's not as much self loathing in the book as in the show at least in the beginning of this book :) but she's not as bad as some of the review said. I actually think the book gives her a more realistic 'high school girl' character. it's a fun easy read. I'd actually say that it's just as entertaining as twilight! just becuase i like the way these vampires are portrayed... (and they don't SPARKLE - that's the one trait that kinda annoys me! :) But again i'm only half way thru the first book of the series :) & maybe i'll have to update this after i'm finished!"
5,So good,"I came across this series after I read Twilight, I was looking for another vampire series. I was not disappointed, in fact I liked this better then Twilight. I loved every second of reading this book."
2,not eager to read this series at all,"I read the first two chapters on this site and I already don't think I'd like it. Elena's character is so annoying, she's so stuck up and judging from the reviews apparently I'm not the only one who thinks so. I've already ordered a used version of the first two (thank God I didn't order new versions) so I'll at least give the first one a chance. If I don't like it, which seems to me to be very likely, then at least I can give it to my sister. I really don't want another stupid vampire story like Twilight."
3,CONFUSED,I LIKE MANY OTHERS HAVE STARTED TO WATCH THE SHOW. I LOVE IT! SO WHEN I HEARD THERE WERE BOOKS I WAS SO EXCITED. I BOUGHT IT AND WAS SO CONFUSED AND DISAPPOINTED. THE CHARACTERS I LOVE IN THE SHOW I DONT LIKE IN THE BOOK. ELENA IS LIKE CAROLINE TO ME FROM THE SHOW AND I DONT LIEK THAT. I THINK IT WAS MADE LIEK THIS BECAUSE THE BOOK WAS WRITTEN SO LONG AGO. ITS HARD TO READ THE BOOKS AND THEN WATCH THE SHOW BECAUSE NOTHING ADDS UP. IT TOOK ME A REALLY LONG TIME TO GET INTO THE FIRST BOOK BUT ONCE IT GOT GOING I LOVED IT. IM WAITING FOR THE NEW BOOKS TO COME OUT I CANT WAIT TO READ THEM...
3,Kinda slow going,"I love the show, and the book was just okay. Although good descriptor usage. Story itself well done I do wish it hadn't ended where it did. There are many big differences between story and show though which do make it interesting."
2,kindle book disappointment,I was disappointed in this book. I will not read the rest of the series. I'll stick to the TV show.
2,Predictable,Vampire Diaries is okay and has a really electric atmosphere but it is seriously predictable. It's just the same forum over and over again. Beautiful girl torn betwen one sickeningly good guy and one totally evil one. Why have all L.J. Smith's heroines got to be so drop-dead gorgeous? Why can't we have a NORMAL looking heroine for a change instead of some super-model?
3,The Show is Better,"I didn't read this series when they originally came out, no reason why not really, just didn't get around to it. But I really started to enjoy the show and wanted to read the books thinking they would be even better. I was a bit disappointed. The show very loosely follows the book. The names of many of the characters are completely different and I found Elena's character a bit annoying. None of the characters were very deep or well rounded, but I suppose that's typical for a YA novel. Perhaps if I had read it at 12 instead of 22 I would have enjoyed it more. Was a bit disappointed, in all honesty. It was okay though."
4,Good One,This is the best vampire book I have read. Once I started I could not put it down. I think I read the whole thing in a couple of nights. Highly recommend.
2,Characters are shallow,"I really like the show on CW and I enjoyed reading the Twilight Saga so I figured I'd check this book out. The first 100 pages was so bad I flipped forward a 100 pages to try to finish off the book. It is just seriously lacking. The characters are shallow and hard to care about. Elena is a little twit, what 500 year old vampire could seriously love her? Katherine is weak? How can that be? She's a vampire! The end of the first book didn't even make me want to read on. I felt the dialogue was forced and very unnatural. I was imagining some of the dialogue as if it was used in the show (an actual conversation) and it was horrible. Twilight is better written and the characters are better developed. I've seen better stories written by middle school kids and Smith is supposed to be a professional. Please. Don't bother wasting your money. I'm glad I picked this up at the library. I'll be returning it promptly."
1,Don't buy this book,"I bought the book on my kindle after watching the first two seasons of the tv-show, I thought it would be the same stories, but it's not. Elena is really mean and obnoxious and if you love the show it will confuse you and disappoint you because everything is different. I'm now reading the Stefan diaries, they are much better."
2,disappointed,Bought this as I LOVED the TV series and thought the book would be even better. Was sadly disappointed. It was written very simple and is very boring compared to the TV series which is very different. It is the first time I have found a programme better than the book its based on..Its taking me a long time to get to the end of a really short book.I would skip the book and watch the show which is gripping and brilliant. This book is very different to the show as are the characters.
5,The best I've ever read!,This series of books was the best I've ever read and I would hope that L.J. Smith would write another book on this. This book and the others drew me in and I couldn't put the book down.
5,amazing,i loved this book. i've been looking for it for 2 years and it was woeth the wait. l.j.smith is the most talented author i know of. the way that she mixes romance and horror. if you want to talk about her books e mail me.
4,My least favorite L. J. Smith book.,"Elena is the most beautiful girl in school and she's dated many guys. Still, she's never even been close to falling for any of them. Then she meets Stefan, a handsome and mysterious new student. Elena really thinks she could be in love with him but there's one thing she doesn't know... he's a vampire. Stefan also has a vampire brother named Damon who, unlike Stefan, doesn't have any qualms about taking a human life. Will Elena be able to avoid getting caught up in their sibling rivalry?This is my least favorite L. J. Smith book I've read so far. I couldn't really get attached to any of the characters. Elena is a bit too full of herself to be really likeable and Stefan and Damon are really cliche. The book is still a decent read and fans of teen vampire books will enjoy it. I'll most likely be finishing the series."
1,For Teeny Bob females only,"Hmm, maybe this is rather harsh for such a dedicated and rewarded writer of teeny bob books...I'm not sure. I enjoyed a few of the other Vampire books, but they were aimed more at females who chew gum and twirl their hair around their fingers.L.J. Smith is like R.L.Stine, change the place, change the names, change the cover and abracadabra!!!! You've got a new book! This vampire thing is getting way to tedious for me...their all the same thing to read now. Might as well just read the first book over and over again."
2,"Watch the show, skip the book","I became interested in the books once I saw the show on The CW. I think the show is great, the best new show I have seen in awhile. After reading the first book, I would say that the show is loosely based off of the books. The show writers have taken a lot of liberties, and I would say, improved upon the original.Take Elena, the main character in both the book and the show. In the book, she is quite mean and self-involved, while in the show she is down to earth and unassuming. I far prefer the show version of Elena. Needless to say, the main character being a polar opposite in the show versus the book can tell you how different the two stories are.When all was said and done with this book, I was unimpressed. I think that it was a rough version of what it could have been. This book needs work, the story is hardly fleshed out at all, making the emotions the characters feel quite unbelievable.Watch the show, skip the book."
5,One of the greatest books ever!,"This is not just another ""I'm going to bite you"" vampire book. This one has more quality and understanding to the feelings of their nature. Mrs. Smith writes terrific novels about the bravery and courage the main characters have and what they go through to procede that way. It's not easy but you'll see that none of them will ever quit in what they believe in."
2,Mills and Boon with blood,"I read both the positive and negative Amazon reviews regarding this book before I started on my own. I am a female, who loves romance and a good vampire story, but I found it quite average. I know, personally, I couldn't relate to Elena, her being the most popular girl in the school and all of that. Im more likely to barrack for the underdog. I think the romantic tension between her and Stefan is a little forced. It doesn't flow too nicely, because its trying so hard to be intense. And you think, well this girl has beauty and popularity - why cant someone else get the drama? I think I better just stick to watching Buffy on TV - and barrack for willow and xander!"
3,The vampire diaries,"I read this book because I watched the vampire diaries and loved it but the book not so much. It was really slow and at the end of the book she just finds out he is a vampire. I like the characters better in the show too. Elena was super sweet and nice and Katherine was the brat. But now it is sort of switched around. Also elena didn't care about her popularity and treating others equally but she pushed people around and like Matt said "" it always has to be about elena."" Well that is why I thought of the book"
1,TVD,"I love watching TVD but man is the book bad. I am so glad the writers took a different approach to the show. The writing in the book was horrible and the character's personalities weren't very good. I hate Elena in the book. No one wants to read a book where the main character is a b****. Plus I hate stories were the main characters fall in love right away. In the book, Elena is instantly in love with Stefan even though they don't spend any time together. That is not how it happens in real life!"
5,Amazing,If you are a fan of the twilight series I highly recommend that you read this! You can also watch the series on the CW Thursday's at 8:00 pm
4,Love!,"I'm a huge fan of The Vampire Diaries show, decided to try out the books and I'm SO glad I did! This book was great, can't wait to get started on the next one!"
5,Better than the show,Elena is so much more interesting in the book than the show. I really liked the first book and am enjoying the sequels. Its a page turner because the characters make you feel for them from the start. They make you want to take the ride with them. This book was absolutely terrific. It's nice when the book outshines its adaptation.
4,Great,Great book. Watched the TV series first so was a little confused at first but everything fell into place and I love it.
4,Good,Slow in the beginning. But so good! Definitely different then the show. I watched that first unfortunately. I'm excited for the next one.
3,?,"This book seemed to go by really fast, which I guess is a good thing because that means it kept my attention. I just expected more excitement. I know it's just the first book in the series but it didn't feel like anything really happened."
3,Definitely not bad.,"So I got hooked on the show a while ago. I absolutely LOVE it!Obviously the book is not exactly like the show. There are way more than a few differences. At first it kinda bugged me, but by the second or third chapter it was hard to stop reading.The show and the book are totally and completely different, but they're both really good! I think that it is worth reading."
3,Skip the book. Watch the tv series,"The book is slow, Elena is a very shallow teenage girl. The book ends with Damon meets Elena, and nothing really happend in this book. The tv series is much more better; and the character are more complicated."
4,I'm glad I got it! :),I bought the used conditions for Pretty Good and Good and it is actually cheaper than buying the new ones. And the used ones don't even look like it been used. But there is still a possibility it might have some wear and damaged that is obvious it's used. I recommend getting the used ones :)
4,fun paranormal,"Enjoyed watching the series, so I thought I would try the books. I was actually surprised I enjoyed it just as much even though the stories characters were cut in the show. A quick easy read to kill the time."
1,Boring!,Over 200 pages in and nothing has really happened! This is horribly boring book that I wouldn't recommend to anyone.
3,Absoultly love the show.... But the book???,I fell in love the first time i watched the show. I had already read the book so I thought i knew what to expect. But was taken by storm. Show Elena and Book Elena are soooo different... Show Damon and Book Damon are a lot different as well. (Must say i love the Show Damon A LOT more)
5,Teen Mom loves this Series!,"Good -vs- Evil, but the line is blurred... It always keeps you guessing!True teen horror/romance.From what I understand, she ended this series only to write one more book later on -- some say they are upset by the ending -- but I love a story that ends on a good note!"
2,one of My boys bought Me this and.........,"DO NOT buy this thing, it doesnt work right, its a complete waste of money! I couldnt get it to stamp a good design out no matter what I did, I followed the instructions that didnt work, I tried MY way and it KINDA worked but the designs were all messed up, the metal plate designs are not deep enough into the plates to get a good clear stamp out of it."
5,Spirtual,"Since recently losing my father, I have been searching for Jewish Spirtual Music to listen to. It was wonderful to find out that my own Cantor from Chizuk Amuno had produced just what I needed to hear. The songs allow me to relive my childhood of going to shul with my father. What more could I ask for? Thank you Cantor Perlman."
5,It does what you'd imagine,"We chose this indicator after a test showed our dishwasher door wouldn't hold magnets. I was a little concerned that the suction cup wouldn't hold, but it's going strong after a month. It looks nice, stays on the door, and is easy to swivel to ""clean"" or ""dirty."" What more could you want, really?"
3,Decent product,"This is a decent product, but it only stays stuck to my dishwasher for a few days without falling off."
3,This is NOT a magnet.,"Okay, I know you should read the product specs closely, but I put in ""Magnet"" for the search and naturally assumed that that's what I was getting.... It's not a magnet AND more importantly, the parts that appear to be white in the photo are actually CLEAR. So, if you happen to have a black dishwasher like I do, or even a stainless one, you can barely see the indicator, let alone read it. Just some thoughts to keep in mind."
1,Cheap piece of junk,"With 5 people in the house we really need something to cling to our dishwasher and let everyone know whether the dishes inside are 'dirty' or 'clean'. Our dishwasher has a stainless steel finish, so a magnet will not work. I thought this suction-cup thingie would work perfectly! Afterall, the surface of the washer is as smooth as humanly possible and perfectly clean. Wrong. The suction cup would never stay on for more than 30 minutes before falling away. After it fell for the second time, from a height of approximately 2 feet off a linoleum surface, the plastic disk (that has the words 'clean' and 'dirty' and that you rotate on the spindle) broke completely in two. I glued it back together, but of course now it looks awful and in any event it still won't stick to anything without falling off within a few minutes. Yeah, it's only $6 after shipping, but spare yourself that wasted $6 and buy something else."
1,Damaged,"When this product arrived, it was chipped in two places, but not worth spending the money to return it. It functions ok, but I was very disappointed that the product arrived damaged with chips and scratches. Does not look new."
4,Almost perfect,"All is well except the indicator could fit a bit more snug. Don't get me wrong, it definitely works and I'd purchase again. But I do wish there wasn't any ""play""."
5,dish clearner indicator,"It works if people actually use it for what it is supposed to do, indicate whether or not the dishes are clean."
5,Ordered two for our office,It works fine and the suction cup works on the stainless. We use them in our kitchen here at work to identify clean vs. dirty.
1,Poor quality,This product does not work on my dish washer. It fell a lot. The back is a rubber. The quality is poor. Do not buy this product! I wish I could return this product.
5,EXCELLENT,"I was afraid the product wouldn't stick on our stainless steel dishwasher, but after reading the reviews, I decided to try this product. It arrived two days earlier than expected and is FABULOUS! It is exactly what we wanted!"
3,Spinner is way to lose,"I bought this for our family so I would know when dishes are clean or dirty.Pros:This spinner has a great suction on it.The design is also niceConcept of just rotating is a great ideaCons:The spinner spins too muchIf you have small kids, they can spin it very easily.The spinner doesn't stay in one spot unless you absolutely don't touch the spinner.overall the concept is good, but I would recommend a magnetic indicator or one that doesn't spin so freely. Half the time the spinner gets touched by a child or just from opening or closing the dishwasher door and the thing spins. Wish the spinner rotated less freely. Would not buy this product."
3,Not Good With Children,The dial is too loose and turns if bumped. It also doesn't work for me because I have a child that can easily reach and spin it making it useless for us.
3,"Clear, not white and a bit loose","The product photo looks like a black and white disk. It is clear and black and does not show up on a black dishwasher. The disk is a bit loose, so is wobbly and does not seem to stay on the proper side of Clean or Dirty.A"
2,DOES NOT STICK WELL,"I purchased this clean/dirty indicator thinking that I had solved the solution to folks in my household not knowing if the dishes were clean or dirty, but was disappointed when after putting it on my dishwasher several times, it kept falling off. The suction cup indeed does not work very well. I followed the suggestion of another reviewer and super glued a small magnet to the back of it and it now works fine. The product should have worked as stated, but glad I found a remedy to the problem. Be prepared to glue on a magnet if it fails to function after you've purchased it or spend more money for one with a magnet already on it!"
3,Really wish it would stay on,"Its such a shame because I love the design and the way the stainless steel shows through the clear parts. However, it would stay on for awhile and then drop off when nobody was even near it. I kept putting it back on until it cracked."
1,Worthless junk,"This is completely worthless. There is no mechanism to latch the dial in a fixed position as ""clean"" or ""dirty,"" so it's free to spin around. Not worth fifty cents, much less the price charged here."
1,not great,"I ordered this and from the photo, I thought it was black and white. It is actually clear and black and we have a black dishwasher so it is almost impossible to read. I'm going to order a different product and donate this one to charity."
3,Clean/Dirty Indicators for Dishwasher,"All in all, I was pleased with this purchase, especially the price. However, several of the Clean/Dirty dishwasher indicators I bought were chipped and they were supposed to be new. Wasn't too bad, though."
1,Twice Disappointed,"I placed one order for 2 InterDesign dishwasher indicators. For some reason, they were shipped on the same day in 2 separate packages which arrived on different dates. The plastic disc was cracked on both products. I didn't bother removing them from their original package. Disappointed with the products. Returned them to Amazon using the printable shipping label; full refund promptly processed."
3,It does what it's supposed to do...with a little modification,"Received product today and didn't realize it was clear and black, but the picture looks like it is black and white. Very hard to read on black appliances. Not a big deal, I should have read the specs closer; my bad. To remedy the viewing to make it easier, I traced around the suction cup on a piece of computer printer paper and attached it to the back side. Now I can read it perfectly fine, so I am happy with it. What do you expect for a few bucks. It works fine enough for me."
3,Not so happy,"This product looks like it might be great and probably is on the right dishwasher. However, mine is black and the letters don't show up well. I tried to spray paint the back white but the paint smeared the letters. So if you have a black dishwasher this won't work."
2,Not what I expected,The spinner was larger than expected and would only stay on the lip of the counter and not on the diishwasher. We ended up ordering a different style altogether
2,Good idea. Not good enough execution.,"The pictures make it look like it's black background and white text vs white background and black text. That's not the case. It's black background and clear text vs clear background and black text. That's a problem because the only place on the dishwasher that I could get the suction cup to stick is on the black area near the buttons rendering it unreadable. I can (and probably will) glue some white paper behind it so that I can read it, but it also has a problem of turning too easily so that I often see it sideways and revert to my old trick to see if the dishes are clean or not by checking to see if the machine is locked. None of my front is metal meaning magnetic signs were out, so I so wanted the suction idea to work, but this one just doesn't quite pull it off."
2,It falls off the dishwasher,"Maybe my dishwasher is too dirty. Maybe I didn't push it hard enough. Maybe I got a duff one. All I know is that it keeps falling off the dishwasher, which makes it kind of useless."
2,Could be better,"I haven't had ay problems with the suction cup, as mentioned above. My nain issue is that it's printed in black on clear plastic. I have a black dishwasher so it's very difficult to read. My solution was to stick white labels on the back to make it legible, but it would have been nice not to need to do that."
1,What a disappointment,This item left rust spots on my stainless steel Dishwasher. The suction cup does not hold and it constantly falls off which has resulted in chips around the indicator.
3,Buy it at the store!,"I like this product, but I just bought it at Fred Meyer for 1.99!! No shipping either! I cannot believe I was going to pat $5 for it. But the item itself is nice for what it is so I did not want to give it less stars!"
2,Doesn't Work,I can't seem to get this to stick to my dishwasher. Too bad - I was really hoping it would work.
3,not what I expected,"not good quality. not worth what I payed. it doesn't stay put (suction doesn't work).AND the ""dial"" won't stay on the word desired to indicate clean or dirty."
3,Iffy,"It is certainly all 7 games of the 2001 world series, but for my money I think they should have done better than record straight from the master tape and leave the imperfections. Extra content is okay. But for your money, you're better saving those dollars and buying the standard 1 dvd 2001 world series."
5,Worth watching again and again,"This video is sensitive to our people and our ways. If you are planning to visit Hopi, this is a video you should watch to gain an understanding of that which is so important in our lives - the planting and harvesting of the corn. So many things in our lives revolve around the harvest. Many whom I have shown this video to agree - it is a fine and accurate representation of our life."
4,Great overall view of the cultural and villages of Hopiland,My husband is Hopi and said that this video is accurate and sensitive to his people. It gives a wonderful view of the everyday life of the Hopi and the commitment to their beliefs. It shows the hardships of living out on the Mesas and the love the people have for their way of life. Ali!!(great in Hopi)
5,"Simple, colorful, and like a kite.. surprising in direction","Grace Lin's pages are filled with spirograph-like swirls, bright patterns, bold colors, and even more colors. The inside cover is filled with drawings of the tools needed to make a kite (paper, scissors, paint, glue, etc), while the back inside cover is filled with the meanings attributed to the types of kites you fly (dragons for wisdom, dragonflies for Summer, butterflies for love, fish for abundance, taods for long life, etc). The whole family is involved in making the feng zheng kite, and then they ascend a hill to fly it with other families. She closes the book by asking the reader to imagine what people's kites are saying about their wishes and desires."
1,switch eroo,i ordered an opteka t-mount and these guys sent me a vivitar t-mount. at least the latter was a $1 more expensive!!
1,kills the piece,"Verdi would have been furious with Callas's interpretation of Aida, trying to turn her into a Norma.The best Aida is Price/Vickers hands down."
3,One draw back..,"This works well for a smaller size bottle. If you enjoy wine like we do, this will not hold a 1.5 L bottle! It comes very close.. This is the only draw back to the product."
5,Marble Chiller Hits The Spot!,Does its' job as well as it looks.Bought two for long/large gatherings! Wine stays cold and chiller is a focal point.
1,bad purchase,I didn't even want to give this one star. The video tape didn't even work. It horrible. I bought it as a gift. The person couldn't even watch it.
5,Amazing Chaconne,"I had the privilege of hearing Linda Wang perform the Chaconne. She played it as an encore piece after a very exhausting performance, but it was still flawless and powerful."
4,Finally a Fine Transfer,"Not among the best of Hope's films, but still a pleasure. Filmed in black and white as all Hope spy films must be. The good news is that unlike other Hope films of this period (The Great Lover, Lemon Drop Kid), the transfer on this DVD is excellent. If only such a clear copy of My Favorite Brunette were available."
5,My Favorite Spy with Bob Hope,"Very funny Bob Hope movie. I saw it first when I was very young, but missed the beginning. For a long time I couldn't find it with an online search."
4,Fun and a good escape...,"I like stories in which characters face the peril of exposure. That exposure can be either to, by (or both) the very one they are trying to impress. Especially if they are in that position due to no fault of their own. Stir in the other ""stuff"", plot turns (not twists- you're in no danger of whiplash) typical Hope absurdities and you have several minutes of escape. I watch it every 3 or 4 years(if I have someting I really want to ingnore) and to repeat at those interrvals I'm always glad that I did...but shorter intervals...I dont think so."
3,Bob and Hedy together,"Typical Hope vehicle with at least an extra treat of Hedy Lamarr. It's not a classic, but has some funny moments. Not his best."
3,DVD My Favorite Spy Review,"Disappointed that this movie is black and white when the cover is color. Still, a classic! The product itself is good quality. Shipping was timely."
1,What type of cable is this?,Please specify the type of cable! Is this an extension for the controller cable or the video cable?
2,Outdated but a good history of the sport,Seriously needs an update. Talks about wooden decoys as the state-of-the-art and fails to note a number of advances we enjoy in the 1998. Would be a good resource for the beginner to get a few of the basics down like do not move in the blind and camoflauge is necessary.
4,Dana Marton's The Sheik's Safety worth reading,"From the Jungles to the Deserts Dana Marton offers intrigue, love, sex, excitement and strong characters. This book is about a female member of the SDDU, Dana, she is lost in the desert after her plane is shot out of the air and when nearly dead found by the Sheik. He saves her and offers her safety. Together they over throw his cousin's reign of terror in the small country where they live. Happily ever after but only after many trials and recoveries. Good read, don't miss this one."
1,Blindered View of Globalization - Great for the Pessimists,I feel bad there are so many Americans out of work. I also am optimistic that this is another phase of job retooling and functional change. Those who aren't ready to face that their career path has alerted will find this great company for their misery because they won't find a new job spending money on this book.Think outside the box. Look at the obvious. Change and grow my friends. I want you all to find great new jobs in the global economy but this book will not move you any closer.
1,Very short story line.,"Take note that the story is only about 5 1/2hrs of game play. It was very disappointing, and it falls way short of the orginial Hunter game. I can't see much replay value in this game."
5,excelente,"es un buen producto , en realidad se lo compre a mi hijo de 10 años y a el le gusta mucho."
1,"I would love to play this, but...","I would love to play this game as I have really enjoyed all the other Hunter games that are out. BUT, I have an older X-box so I can't play it! The game won't even start up! I tried several copies but to no avail... it just won't work. So take heed to this warning: If you purchased your X-box shortly after they came out, don't bother getting this game. Or at least rent it first to see if it will even play."
4,Classic Clark Shoe at a great price,"This shoe is very comfortable. It has quite a wide fit so bear that in mind when ordering. The toe is a little squarer than it looks in any of the pictures. I quite like the 'athletic' laces but I may go to the 'string' style which I think suits the Clark shoes better.Overall, a good value shoe, perfect for anyone who is on their feet for extended periods."
1,UN_Confortable - forget about it ....,Box toes - people do not have boxed toes....Other vendors will accept returns - but Amazon will not....due to an arbitary date of return .......
4,Great shoe,"I've had foot surgery and very few shoes have the comfort and padding that can support a big guy like me all day. Clarks are fantastic shoes and after 12 hours on my feet they still very good. A little small in the toe, but other than that, great support and very comfortable."
4,its pretty comfortable,"if you compare with other models, this shoe giving me pretty comfortable with my foots. when I walk its so nice of this.I was so happy after I bought this shoe."
4,Good fit and value,"Shoes arrived shortly after they were ordered. After a few days break in period, shoes are very comfortable. Plenty of interior room. Shoe appearance is much wider than they show on site, and they are more squared off than they appear. All in all, this is a good shoe and a good value."
3,Nice shoe,Nice shoe not very high end but they run about half a size smaller than other Clarks shoes. So if your a 10 order the 10 1/2.
4,"good value, good combination of style of function",Like the shoes. They fit well and look nice. As noted in other reviews they do run slightly wide which is perfect for my 12W foot.
5,Great Shoes....Great Price !`,These shoes are extremely comfortable! The price was amazing and they were deilvered with lightning speed.
2,Used to be a good company?,"The shoe looks nice and it is comfortable, but after wearing it a total of 4 times the inside is starting to come apart. So, it is a matter of poor workmanship, low quality material, or poor product design?"
3,Quiet,After wearing these shoes for a couple of weeks I think they are descent.They felt a little low around the ankle at first but I dont notice that any more. Soles are very quiet and have good flex. I walk a lot and find that the inserts dont have great cushion but may be alright for others.
3,A picture may not be better than 1000 words,"From the picture, the style of the shoes looked good. But when arrived, the style was too squared. It is still comfortable and good value for the price. However, make sure you like the style first before you buy them."
4,Shoe Review,"Decent pair of comfortable shoes for the price. Overall a solid value, and shipping was thrifty."
5,High Quality Merchandise,"The Clark's Kip Oxford, is of excellent quality & craftmanship. This is one of the best bargains i have ever had the opportunity to take advantage of in my history of internet shopping. My husband LOVES these shoes and says that they are the most comfortable shoe he has ever owned, and delivery was amazingly fast. Thank You"
2,This CD sucks BAD!,Pakelika and Grand Vanacular have no sense of rhyme. All the beats suck... I only gave it two stars because 1.Pak can dance and 2. I saw KMK live. MC Hawking has better beats and rhymes than this.
4,definaly a underground classic,"if u guys didnt know Pakelika before u bought this cd then u must not be a Krowner, Pakelika is from the Livin Legend Band THa kottonmouth kings, he teams up with his partner GV, to release there second offering, and it sums up to be a underground classic, its got classic hits, ya it may be a bit too long, but if u actually listen to the cd u will find out there is alot of decent, and killer songs, thats perfect for a party, and a good time, deftinaly worth it, cuz its going to be a hard cd to find, cuz they broke up, cop right now"
3,It's what I thought I wanted.,"I had lost the brush/scoop that came with my grinder and most other brushes I saw seemed like they'd be far too soft to really get at anything, so I ordered this one.It functions... but I think the bristles are a little too thick for my purposes, it's particularly hard to clean out the container where coffee grounds go- I've had to use the brush in combination with water, while previously I could've gotten away with simply brushing it out. The brush simply is too stiff to get into the corners I think, and I hope this will get better with time as the hard bristles soften a bit.If possible I would've preferred a brush with shorter and thinner (but still made of the same material) but I can't tell if this is a shortcoming of the brush or simply that it doesn't work will with the grinder I'm using it for. As far as cleaning the burr part of the grinder, it does an okay job, but there are tiny indentions that it simply can't get into due to the stiffness of the bristles."
2,i don like the game,"i dont like this game,i dont like flying games .but this one you dont do anything"
3,Not the original music,"I found the title to this CD misleading because it made me believe that it included the original recordings by John Williams. Unfortunately that is not the case. This is 3rd party recordings of the classics, with LOTS of liberty taken, especially with the Cantina Band song. Personally I was disappointed in this CD, BUT the Star Wars fan that I bought it for LOVED it. And it was very reasonably priced."
4,Really nice and tastefully done indie rock,"I can't believe I'm the first person to review this album.So far, this is my favorite indie-rock album of 2005. Yep, I said it and I mean it. Now, we all know there's been a ton of great albums so far this year, but this one has gotten the most steady play on my computer.I guess it's just that Black Lipstick takes a lot of my favorite bands as their influences, and then finds a way to meld them together in a pleasing way.The influences range from Velvet Underground and Jonathan Richman to Sonic Youth and Pavement to Television and Echo & the Bunnymen.The music is pretty straight-forward and stripped down for the most part. Simple beats and chiming guitars. Intelligent lyrics. Good stuff."
1,this book is @#!%^&,OH my God this book sucks so bad.When i first read the review of this I WAS Shocked at what I read. The person made it seem like the storyline and characters of this book were actually original.I could find a book exactly like this in a trash can or on the street.The reviewer also made it seem like the main character and her son are locked in an epic battle of emotions worthy of a tv movie.The reviewer is in my opinion a much more exciting writer than catherine palmer.Even the supposed action parts are boring and unoriginal
1,|'m so glad I read the reviews for this book,"I've had this book for about a year, and everytime I tried to read it, I was horrified by the terrible writing, ridiculous theories and slavish devotion of Karen Willi for Harris Kern. And yet, I wasn't able to throw this piece of trash where it belongs because of the 4 star rating. I kept feeling I SHOULD like it; everyone else does!Tbank goodness, I finally read the reviews and realized that the 4 star rating is a complete fake!"
2,No,"I don't regret buying the book. You can always learn something in everything. As far as discipline though, I didn't get anything out of it. If you want someone to tell you how to live your life and what should be important to you yes buy this book, he will map out your life and teach you to fear failure. There isn't any actual application as to how to achieve disciple. I always encourage people to think for themselves, success varies from every person. To my standard of life these authors aren't living successfully. We are all different. I was looking at two books to buy this one and another called Self-Discipline in 10 Days: How to Go from Thinking to Doing... I would recommend the other. I haven't read it yet but I'm hearing better reviews."
3,Most people lack self-discipline,"I thought this was a fairly informative book. Though the authors keep bringing up the word ""discipline"", it's not clear how to achieve it. What I do agree with is the authors notion of failure. Failure can't be tolerated. Most people tend to come up with excuses regarding goals and resolutions, and find ways to not reach their goals. I think many people can benefit from this book."
1,Terrible book,"This book is ""self-published"", and you can see why is wasnt picked up by a professional publisher. Namely because the quality is low in terms of content, utility, coherence, etc.People should be aware most of the five star reviews have been written by people who have a personal or business relationship with the author."
4,What's the Big Deal?,"It's easy for me to document my routine as you recommended with PRIME but it's difficult to change my habits to make my life more productive.I like the message, the simplicity, and the direct approach Kern and Willi used in their book. However I think I could use some help with the execution. Based on what you write - I waste a heck of a lot of time everyday. I think if you had the answer to help motivate me then you might have a bestseller."
1,The worst-written book I've ever read,"Not only do the authors rant on and on about the demise of discipline in our society, they write as if they were still in junior high! There were lots of little suggestions about what the authors do to be disciplined but they apparently grew up this way and have no idea how to explain this to others who've been less than disciplined most of their lives. I also didn't like the bashing of the undisciplined; I thought the authors' mission was to teach discipline - they sure don't think much of people who don't have it. Overall, a poorly written, negative, repetitive, uninformative book. Just goes to show that anyone can start their own publishing company in order to publish their own propaganda! And a tree was killed for this! After reading the titles of the positive reviews, it is pretty evident they are marketing ploys - they sound like the ones you find inside front covers (written by people who are requested to come up with something to say)!"
1,No substance,"This book was a waste of my time and money. I kept reading, hoping to find something useful, but was disappointed. I think the title should have been ""I Think I'm Better than You Because I Have a Type A Personality."" The book contains plenty of anecdotes but not any real substance. The only thing I gained from it was a cautionary lesson on not purchasing self-published books in the future."
2,"Too much cruft, not enough good stuff","Reading between all the platitudes and ""inspirational"" quotes, their main thesis seemed to be ""don't waste time"". Which is fine, but I didn't need a book to tell me that. And, okay, maybe I do regain two hours a day if I reduce my sleep time from 8 hours a night to 6, but I doubt I'm as efficient."
2,Reviewed by Coaching Student,"After reading through this book, it seems that the essential quality for being a highly disciplined person is a willingness to always make productive use of time. For me, this is the main idea in the book. To forge a new relationship with time.The book is not well written in terms of sentence structure and grammar, and is loaded with typos such as ""you're happiness"" etc. Such errors often got in the way of my ability to appreciate the material. The whole book reads like a first draft that was thrown together in a few weeks. With these qualifiers, I'd still say that I enjoyed reading this book. It's a raw, loosely edited outpouring of enthusiasm for a life lived with motivation and discipline. If you don't get caught up in the poorly written aspects, it's possible to get swept up in this enthusiasm."
1,Not Impressed,"This is the first book that I have ever returned to Amazon, because of the content not meeting my expectations. It wasn't helpful and offered unrealistic solutions"
1,"Huh? Are you guys reading the same book as I,","or are you his friends? There's a lot of things that bothered me about this book, many of which were already mentioned, so I will try not to repeat them. See the 1 star rating reviews! I should have paid closer attention to them. First of all, stylistically it is so poorly written! It's like a high school student wrote this book; no offense to the honor English kids. Despite the title, it offered no help for the undisciplined. The only thing good about it is that it is nice and short and requires very little reading comprehension. So, even if you are so undisciplined, you can still finish it:) What exactly is this book about? It is a poorly written autobiography. Mr Kern said that it is ok to have an ego, as long as you don't let anyone know about it. THEN HE WRITES A BOOK LIKE THIS! LOL If you are looking for techniques or principles to increase your daily discpline, LOOK ELSE WHERE!"
1,Annoying at Best...,"This is the worst self-help book I have ever read. It is written by two self-righteous, self-important people whose qualifications are questionable. It is written in the first and second person; either the author is patting himself on the back, or patting his co-author. It's great that they apply a discipline in their lives, but preaching it is different from giving those of us without self discipline the knowledge and ""how-to's"" to break the laziness habit. ""Just do it"" doesn't cut it. There are better books on the market for this subject."
5,Just Say It...Discipline!,Thanks for trying to make discipline a household word again. Most people are so turned off by this word - sad to say in our society it still has a negative connotation. Your books have changed my life for good and hopefully one day it will have a positive impact on others too. Just maybe people won't be afraid to mention the word discipline!
3,Provides some good pointers,"It is clear to me the authors felt they have some credibility issues. They talk about their strengths and achievements a little too much. It is probably because the authors really have no formal education or is an ""expert"" on the subject of discipline. They are just professionals who seemingly have reached their success using their personal discipline. The book has lot of good pointers and inspiring text, which makes it a worthwhile read, especially for its relatively cheap price. Just don't expect the pointers to be backed up by any clinical research."
3,Not for everyone,"Harris may mark on his tombstone ""Discipline - but Lord, death was not on my schedule for today""Discipline, such as defined in his book, appears to have worked for Harris - My question is, is he really happy or does he stay so ""disciplined"" that he doesn't know or care to know. To ascertain that a single minute of each day is not wasted, is a burden that I would not wish on anyone.There are some good points in his book, such as television is generally a waste of time and eat right and exercise to stay in good health.Harris needs to understand that what is good for Harris may not be right for others.Remember, if you take the time (discipline) when someone reaches out to you for help, on their terms not yours, and you respond to that call in an effective and timely manner, you will have the respect to serve not only mankind but also your creator and yourself."
1,Not worth the money or the time.,"I read a variety of self development books, most of which are very good. This book however left me feeling like the authors were on a soapbox ranting about discipline. No inspiration or words of wisdom here."
1,Whatever.,"I'll confess to only reading about half of this book, but that's all I could stand. A lengthy 'introduction' dwells on how great the lead author is in the eyes of the co-author, and vice-versa (seemingly an effort to lend a kind of co-credibility). The advice that is eventually given consists mainly of antedoctal and single-minded paragraphs extolling us to get up early and stop wasting time.Addressing the causes behind a lack of self-discipline would appear to be in order, but no discernible effort is made toward that end.Keep looking - I'm sure there are better ways to attain self-discipline than combining a treadmill workout with reading a magazine."
1,The worst book I've ever read,"This is not a book but a completely disorganised collection of very poorly written rants. Expect time-saving tips such as ""do something else while waiting for the shower to get warm.""! Absolutely no use whatsoever unfortunately - I binned it as soon as I'd read it."
5,Perfect Antidote,"Harris' and Karen's new book is the perfect antidote to flaging energy. It jump-starts the reader (or re-rails him) on the fast-moving train of discipline, with practical, real-life advice, good humor, a glad heart and great quotes. This is a truly motivational book for all aspects of living."
5,Dragon Kites and Dragonflies,The drawings are very nice. The nursery rhymes are enjoyable. I really like this book. I lived in Singapore for 5 years and will share it with my grandchildren.
2,Deadly Dull,"I don't know how anyone can hang in there and read 7 stories like this. I couldn't find any redeeming qualities. How can you call Francesca sleuth extraordinaire when she in turn suspected every guy with any connection to the victims. It was just a guessing game with her. These stories are just full of mixed up people's sex lives. The things they give Francesca credit for solving are a bit much and only 20 years of age. It's a good thing she lives at home on her family's money with people to dress and feed her cause it's obvious she couldn't do it on her own. And if Evan marries Bartolla, he needs his head examined! She's pregnant? that's the oldest trick in the books. Take her to a doctor for pete's sake. I won't be looking for the next installment in this saga."
4,Wonderful Book,I really enjoyed this book and like another reviewer said there was a certain freshness to this book. The relationships between the secondary characters really seemed to evolve.
2,"not bad, but not good",Pros-cheap-good quality-user friendlyCons-HORRIBLE BATTERY LIFE-A pain-Few optionsOverall: Don't get it unless you won't use it a lot
2,Decent Camera for the Novice User,"I got this camera as a Christmas present in 2005 and it's been decent for me for the 2-3 years I've had it.pros:- Easy to Use...pretty much point and click with a no-hassle menu- Cheap/Affordablecons:- The flash is just not very intuitive and I've began turning off the flash because it wears thin on me at social gatherings in dark spots.- Horrible Battery Life...I took this camera on a 2 week trip to Italy and had to insert a pair of Double A batteries every other day (I only took 400-500 shots). The problem is the power usage of the digital screen on the back of the camera. Once that's turned off, the battery life extends to 1-2 weeks sometimes under the same usage as my time in Italy.- A little bit too blocky for users that want something slim.Overall, it's an ok starter camera, but for someone that expects to use a camera quite often, I suggest trying something else."
4,Better than anticipated,I was worried when I placed the order as to what it would look like. It was much better quality than I even imagined picking it out on line. My friend will be delighted at Christmas time.
5,802,A small simple mixer ! I currently use it in a amateur radio set up with a C-1 Behringer Microphone and get great replys. What ever your use im sure you will be happy with this product.
4,I love this thing.,I bought one from a bassist in my old band and even after him having it for a couple years it works great. I don't yet have an interface so I'm just using it for a p.a.
4,works as promised,"first off let me say I'm not an audio guy and really only bought this as a casual hobby, something to tinker with, that said it works as promised, my only grip with it is there is no power on/off button, that is unless i just missed it, but digging through all of the documentation as well as searching for one on the device yielded nothing. documentation wise, it's for people who know what they want, I'm a media guy so i was able to piece it together but that said, it does more than what i wanted it to do for a good price."
3,Good for a learning tool,"If I had the choice I would definitely not use this for any sort of professional production or performance equipment, but for basic leaning purposes as to how mixers work I would recommend this simply for the low price. There is a lot of noise on the line when you plug into it and the pre-amps were less than impressive to say the least. Overall though it will be an entertaining little board to play with."
4,Behringer Xenyx 802,"Price is right but I have not tried it long enough. I have to buy more microphones to try it out again. I am sure it is a good unit for mixing music vocals, etc."
2,Worked Well For A Day,"I was really excited to receive this sound board! I hooked it up and it worked great.....for a little while. 2 days after I got it the 1 & 2 inputs stopped working. Sent it back, I'm guessing that it was just a problem with my individual board and not a problem with the product in general."
1,"Plugged It In, It Blew Up","In contrast to the case, which looks solid, the power supply connection is extremely fragile. When I inserted the connector into the unit, one of the pins bent over and contacted the plug shield, shorting the connection and blowing the power supply.I've been plugging things in for a while now, this is the first time this has happened to me. For a unit without an on-off switch I'd think the power connector would be an important thing to get right.The problem is the electrical pins are as long as or longer than the alignment stud so when I spun the connector around in the socket it scraped the electrical pins off alignment and when I matched the alignment stud and pushed the connector in, it didn't socket the electrical pins, it bent 'em off.It's arguably my fault, but it's also arguably a design defect. I'd send it back but what are they going to do? Send me another? So it's off to Radio Shack for a new power supply and solder. Good thing I'm a techie. :)"
2,Left Channel Broken,"Everything on the device works okay. I get low volume feedback, even after buying new cables. Not a huge deal because i'm able to remove most of it with software, but what really dropped the stars was that the left channel does not work on the output labelled CD\TAPE (it's barely audible. I've tried panning full left, even panning, and full right. None of the combinations make the left channel more audible. (also tried new cables).Unfortunately, after buying all new cables trying to make sure it wasn't the mixer, i feel outside of my return period by 4 days, so i'm stuck with a product that doesn't work like it's supposed to :("
1,Thumbs down for Beringer mixer,"I was sorry this mixer didn't work - right out of the box. But I enjoy Amazon and their quality service so I thought I'd send it back to Beringer. But no such luck in getting a repair - let alone a prompt repair. After a couple of hours trying to find service for this piece, including calling the factory service center I finally unburied online, (it was in Pittsburgh - I'm in Philadelphia) - I was told they might be able to get me the part but it would be a while. I finally sent it back to Amazon."
1,Power connector failure,"The power connector on this mixer survived exactly three insertions. At out first actual public event, one of the ridiculously small pins broke off rendering the mixer useless. The electronics on this device may actually be very good -- we'll never know, because there is no way to power it up."
5,Very Happy,Amazon remains my place to shop for almost everything. They cover all the bases and never disappoint. Shipped quickly and packed properly. Thank you Amazon.Only failing is the should be easy ability to email a person with a problem or question. It takes forever to figure out what to do and even then it doesn't address what you wanted to do. My 2 cents on your only failing.Phil LaMarche
4,Works good.,"My first impression wasn't great. The outer box it was shipped in was fine. But, the factory box was a little flimsy looking. When I opened it though, everything was packed tight and was fine. I am able to hook up my iPod and/or laptop to a speaker and it works fine. When trying to use with those devices and go through a main board though, could have used some more instruction in the manual. Overall, a good product that with more experience or maybe more technical manual instructions, will do exactly what I need it to do. I do have to agree with some of the other reviewers, an on/off switch would be very helpful."
4,Good product,"I use it for home karaoke. Sound is much better than the DVD karaoke I used before. If it come with a power on/off switch, it should has 5 star."
1,Smoked and caught on fire one month in.,Was in my studio when this thing just caught on fire out of nowhere. CHEAP material. I was warned later to stay away from all products by these guys - as they are far below sub-standard.
1,Not so good,"The price was right but the 1st one I recieved didn't work at all. I contacted Amazon and a replacement was sent out right away. The 2nd unit worked but every channel was distorted before you could reach and acceptable output level. Output volume actually decreased significantly when running a mic through the unit, compared to the direct mic input on the amp. I requested a refund and returned the unit. The refund was received shortly after that. All in all, the buying and returning process was excellent. Too bad the product wasn't built that way."
3,Doesnt hook up to a computer,the only reason im giving this a 3 star is its not usb capable so for starting out recording it doesnt make much sence to me i dont get how rca cables can hook up to a cd player to record it makes no sense not for usb to computer use just for... mixing.. and stuff idk
2,returned item,"i ended up buying the wrong board when i bought this one. the description was confusing and i returned it immediately. oh well, can't win em all."
5,Excellent,Excellent for my homemade recording studio. I connect it to my portatil PC and I record the sound of the musical instruments without problems. The sound is clean and good. I recommend it.
4,behringer mixer,I would have liked to see at least 2 XLR outputs also but I guess that would be too expensive to build into a small inexpensive mixer like this. it's a great product and does what it says it will do. and amazon of course shipped it right away as usual
2,Non-working,"When I received this product, I assume I got a defective one. The phantom power portion of the mixer had a short in it and my microphones would not stay powered."
4,Good Product,"I was looking Karaoke system and found this item which i can use with my home theater and can connect additional devices. Use this system in Parties with multiple devices - Laptop, iphone, two mics. Product performance is excellent and give ability to turn off the input by control. Do recommend this product."
4,Great Mixer for the Price,"This is a 50 dollar mixer. Don't expect it to be anything more, but I can tell you that it is definitely nothing less either. I use this every day to plug 4 keyboards into one MPC & it works perfectly for that. This is not my main mixing board nor should it be anyone's unless you are a hobbyist just looking to have fun (that's cool too!). The EQ's are decent, but I wouldn't really count on them for a main EQ or anything - it's just nice to have them there.My only complain with this mixer is that there is no power switch! You have to unplug the board for it to turn off which is more of a pain that you I imagined. Also, the light on this board is extremely bright. Much brighter than any other light I have on any of my various instruments/electronics. All this being said, for 50 bucks it does the job well.4/5"
3,Works well,"This does work well, but with all the built in technology of programs like Logic Pro and Cakewalk this is becoming obsolete...at least for what I was using it for. I used this to record some demos on my PC and Laptop and I didn't really need it after a while, however when I did have it, it definitely did a good job. I was never able to get the FX knobs working...and maybe that's because I was just learning at the time, but I found that I only needed my USB sound card to record and this just sits on the side until I have more use for it. Maybe it's for use if you have someone else recording you in a small time studio and they need to hear you while you're recording...that's the only use that I could think of for this...anything other than that and it's over kill."
3,the sound,"the sound is come with a little noise.....but...is very cool!!!!....got lot of chanel for conect your divice and your computer,."
4,quality,Not having a on and off button is a real turn. Also the power light is too bright. Other than that i got this to power 48V AT2020 and it is doing really well. I am impressed with the quality.
2,Behringer 802 8input mixer Preamp,"Well, it works, theres not much about it, I choose it because of the price, but wish that I had gotten something else. it does save me from having to reach down on the floor where the computer is located to pull the speaker cables out when its time to record. When I hook the speakers to this unit however, its not such a great sound quality."
5,A nice little mixer!,"For what this does you can't go wrong for the price! I have a small recording setup and play guitar (and bass) with friends. This little mixer gets both of those jobs done right. Sure a more expensive mixer might be able to tweek your vocals or instruments more, but all I needed was a way to mix up to 4 inputs at at time and out put to my speakers and laptop for recording. It does all of those jobs well. There is no hum when the unit is on. I have two small grips though..and they are minor...the EQ isn't that great and the volume to the headphones is lower than I like. Maybe I'm going deaf."
5,Great Value,"I was wondering if I made a mistake after I placed the order for this mixer. I however, am very pleased with the mixer preformance for the price. I use it in my home to listen to music and even plug my guitar in to play along. Works great for that. It doenst get moved and I'm the only one using it. I love it!!!"
3,Clean and versatile mixer,"I can't say I'm too happy about the Behringer Chinese-Dormitory/Factory set-up this company decided to tout in accompanying literature with the product. I thought I was buying German-made. The full color pamphlet celebrates their 20-something Anniversary of the Chinese Plant and notes that they suspended the 9 pm curfew for the dorms so that everyone could celebrate the momentous occasion. I kid you not! Buy one and read it! But the unit performs flawless, the build is solid and me likey likey!"
5,Great Product,"Awesome product for the price. I am using it to manage my outputs from the computer, rack etc. into my studio monitors and headphones. It's a nice product. If you need something that works and is cheap, this is the one."
3,Uncertain piece of equipment.,"Boy, I'm really not sure about this one. As a motion picture sound mixer of several decades, I've had no problems navigating around the controls of this home-use mini-console. I am confused, though, about some of the inexplicable fluctuations in output signal I've experienced. For seemingly no reason at all, the output will jump from not nearly enough to way too much, without my having done anything to influence it. I suspect that the cause is some sort of intermittent connection inside the unit, which, in this day and age of relatively consistant component standards, would show a rather shabby level of quality control. Frankly, even in this modest price range, you should at least be able to expect some stability in your signal flow."
4,Review of Xenyx802 Mixing Board,"Behringer Xenyx 802 Premium 8-Input 2-Bus Mixer with Xenyx Mic Preamps and British EQsThe Behringer Xenyx802 Mixing Console is a Must for any one wanting to get ""studio"" quality sound for a decent price. Easy to use and Set-Up."
4,"Good, but for the price, GREAT","Good is the perfect word to describe this, until you take into account the price. Then it's surprisingly excellent. My only complaint is the power socket/plug mating is less than super tight and if you move the unit or the power cord around a lot, it tends to disconnect. This isn't an issue once you're set up, obviously.I just worry about its lifespan if it's this loose to begin with. Maybe flattening the plug a bit will cause it to mate tighter. This problem isn't even bad enough for me to try that, though."
5,Fantastic for the price,"Considering the upward trend in pricing on entry level audio electronics as of late (thanks to podcasting...) this unit easily satisfies a multitude of requirements at a bargain price. The build quality is on par with other Behringer products (read: all but perfect), noise is not an issue (SNR 110dB), the ""British"" (haha) style EQ is clean and the thing just works.I too complain of no power button. A soft-on toggle/rocker would have been a nice addition, given the recommended power-on procedure (Connect power supply to board, then plug supply into the wall) but I suppose it could be easily solved with a remote control outlet."
4,A Good Bang for the Buck,"I found this product very satisfactory for my limited use to entertain my friends and family. The product is easy to use and it has many options to connect to other equipments such as computer, TV or AV receiver. It feels solid in its construction. The only con. I have is that it does not not have a power off switch. I recommend this product."
1,Power Supply Problem,"Worked great for just over 6 months. Plugged in the power supply one day, nothing. Very disappointing and since it's was beyond 90 days, Amazon won't help. Sucks!"
5,One of the 20 best books ever writen in Brazil.,"I'm a (unemplyed) agronomist and I live in Brazil.I read this book translated to portuguese, some years ago.This book was writen(at least the end part) by a european jew refugee, here in Brazil.In fact, the author died by suicide, after ending this great book.There's many things about this book.At first this is a self-biography, a history book, etc.Reading this great book, you can be transported to Europe about 100 years ago until 1930's Europe.It's very rare, a self-biography to be also a sincere and complete book.And this a self-biography very sincere.This book doesn't tells only about Stefan Zweig itself.You can see happiness, carity, sincerity, wisdom and also madness, hipocrisy, bigotry all maden by man living in times and places, when the author of this great book was writen and living."
1,Blecch,"This book is the epitome of that unfortunate trend in prewar writing where authors will ramble on in paragraphs that run for pages and pages, repeating themselves upwards of three or four times, because they haven't yet managed to leave behind the romantic tradition of writing really long, boring novels. This book was recommended to me by a European friend of mine who absolutely loved it, and perhaps the cultural difference has something to do with my dislike of it, but I think it's more to do with the interminable redundancy of the writing."
4,A long gone world,"Although largely forgotten nowadays, Stefan Zweig was one of the most widely read and respected authors in the first third of the Twentieth Century. He is famous for the deep psychological aspects in his novels. “The World of Yesterday” is a memoir of a long gone period of Europe, which will probably never come back. It offers precious glimpses of social life in Europe pre-War World I. Perhaps, it can be better described as a social history written by a novelist. As in all Zweig’s works, the writing is very lively and descriptive making this book a joy to read. For me, the most interesting parts were how Zweig, himself, and his fellow Jewish friends viewed the rise of Hitler and how they coped with the hardships."
3,Technical matter,"Page 174 was omitted by the publisher. Hasn't anyone noticed? I want page 174, please. Also, the binding is very easy to break. Don't drop the book."
2,So-So Read,"If you have recently discovered this amazing writer you will be tempted to read his final words. However, compared to his previous work, the writing here does not flow as effortlessly. He refers to a lot of names (politicians, artists, and writers, etc.) and places, but I'm afraid the majority of these references will only make sense to a European history buff.In fact, much of the book will only hold the interest of a history student.I had hoped the book would document HIS world of yesterday thoroughly--his motivations for writing particular books etc.--instead it goes into details about Europe far too much.An OK read, but if you want to skip this one you won't be missing much. Maybe his best work was too good and this mediocre, long-winded good-bye pales against it."
1,KIndle edition unreadable,Bland pages beyond introduction except for a single column of letters on the right hand side. Did someone checks this out? Why bother to sell it?
5,Real Life Application With A Celebrity Spin,"So many of the self-help books I read don't provide the tools that I can apply TODAY to make a substantial improvement in my career and life. When I finished reading SHINE, not only did I have a solid direction and road map for how I am going to achieve my goals, I had a whole new perspective for how I perceive today's celebrities and their successes. This was a terrific read from start to finish. I'm looking forward for ways to learn more from Larry and his clients."
2,Not that great,"The original was a delight and I was thrilled to find it in DVD. However, it has been changed, and I would not recommend."
5,Wonderful video for preschool kids,My son LOVES this video. Has watched it since his 2nd birthday/xmas season. Still watches it. The songs are traditional and fun.
2,"VHS- Great, DVD- Not...","I completely agree that they really messed this one up. The original was charming and heart warming, but the new one is...well, a little creepy. I think the voiceover reminds me of The Nightmare Before Christmas, which is a great film, but not at all what this video was about. The new songs don't flow well, and the differences in animation are jarring at best. I really can't see why they changed it at all, except maybe to lengthen it. I just shelved my DVD and ordered another VHS to replace my old one. I don't think the DVD wil get pulled out anytime soon...."
5,"Mickey Mouse Christmas ""Sing-Along"" DVD","My Granddaughter,Ms Stella Leonora,loves to sing as it is,and once she received this DVD the other day, I am positive that her parents are about ""crazy"" as she played it twice the first day she received it! Now she has ""Jingle Bells"" & ""Santa Claus Is Coming To Town"" ""down pat"" THANK YOU for making my granddaughter's(2 1/2 yrs of age) Christmas 2011 a merrier one..."
1,They Changed It!,"I was very disappointed in this DVD. I ordered it expecting to be exactly like the VHS I had when I was a kid. Instead of it opening with Mickey Mouse and Jimney Cricket, it opened with a camera going through a model train set and a unidentified man with a not-quite British accent delivering a long and rather badly written poem about Christmas. He talked between every single song. Also, there were all of these new songs which weren't the same quality as the old ones. Finally, I made it to the Wooden Soldier Brigade song, and they had CHANGED the soundtrack. They ruined a good thing. Why, Disney? Why?"
5,Great Family Fun!!,"I Purchased this video for my daughters last year (they're now 3). We all enjoy sitting around the T.V. watching and singing all the Christmas classics. The girls love every song and have learned just about all the words.!! WE watch this video even when it's not Holiday season, it's alot of fun ! Now I just purchased another copy to give to a friend of mine who has recently moved to the United States. I know she will find it a fun way to become familiar with American classic holiday music- even though she is over 21."
1,THEY CHANGED IT!!!!!,"It just not Christmas in our house with out the Merry Christams video, why did they have to change something so wonderful. I guess its too late to cancel my order,but maybe I can send it back."
1,Disappointed,"I expected this to be a modern Disney program, with recognizable characters singing Christmas songs, (based on the release date and cover art). Instead, this DVD is a compilation of clips from very old Disney movies/shows, each about 3 or 4 seconds long, thrown together while Christmas music plays and corresponding words bounce across the screen. True, the song choices are great, but the visual consists of fast-moving, disjointed, ancient animation. There is no flow, no storyline. After a few songs, I felt dizzy from watching. It was agitating and obnoxious. Further, my son kept asking where Mickey Mouse was, because the Mickey on the DVD is from about 50 years ago and unrecognizable to him. Nope, not my favorite, would not recommend."
4,Great DVD for the Disney lover!,"I bought this DVD for my 1 year old son to introduce him to Christnas carols and he loved it! The DVD provides most of the same footage from the original VHS format, but it's now a little lengthier. Given my son's short attention span due to his young age he didn' sit through the whole thing, but he seemed to enjoy the songs he's heard us sing him throughout the holiday season. I totally recommend this!"
2,Disappointed,"This product did not turn out as expected. I was hoping for something that could be used as a Christmas sing-a-long. Before you even get to that part, the beginning is filled with promos of Disney movies and other paraphanalia. This takes up much time and then when you get to the sing-a-long, the songs are interrupted by characters speaking. I was looking strictly for a sing-a-long and this is more like cartoons for children to watch."
5,The Best Sing-Along!,"We have several of the Sing Along DVD's and this is the BEST one! The songs are wonderful Holiday favorites, and it is much longer than most of the Sing Alongs. It's the first Holiday DVD that comes out and the most watched!"
5,Great christmas video,"Before purchasing this video, I checked it out from my neighborhood Library. After watching it my two daughters loved it. I went and purchased it and within 2 days of watching it over and over again, they knew every song. I highly recommend!"
4,Disney Makes Christmas Special - With Songs,"This DVD has 20 of the all time favorite Christams Music for the whole family.They are each complete with words that flash over colorful pictures and images from old, new and classic Disney animation and characters.From the Fantasia to Beauty & The Beast to Mickey to Ariel. It closes with a great group singalong that ues all the characters and their voices togethr. It is segmented to skip songs or hear your favorites over and over.The DVD also contains a game as well as a create your own greeting card section. Cute and really great for the really young ones to interact with thier parents.A great DVD for the family to have around Christams time. Have fun. (12-2-03)"
1,This is not what you think it is,"How can you call this ""Very Merry Christmas"" and not have that song on here? Lynn Gibson must have imagined ""From all of us to all of you"" being on this DVD, or she didn't actually watch it before reviewing, because that song is not on the DVD. The description also makes it sound like it has the classic Disney Christmas cartoons on here, but in reality there are only short clips of the cartoons from Jiminy Cricket's Christmas special (apparently not available on DVD) set to newly-sung Christmas songs. This was a huge disappointment and definitely not what we were hoping for."
3,Very Cute.....,This is a cute video. It has more religious songs than I would of liked. I expected mostly fun goofy songs about Christmas. It is a children's video after all. The music itself is well done. There is a wide range of characters singing. Not a bad video over all.
2,keep the VHS,not as the same as the VHS my 13 and 14 yr old loves the old one i got them when they where 5yrs old when it came out keeping old one putting it on DVD myshelf
5,A favorite Christmas tradition!,Our family loves this sing-along movie! It is classic Christmas time fun from when I was a child. My 3 year old daughter loves singing along and even my 10 year old son will watch with her (although he doesn't do much singing). Watching this is a great Christmas tradition our family loves!
2,very boring,"songs were very slow and boring, not peppy enough for kids and there is a narrator in between each song. did not keep my child's attention at all"
2,Disappointing,"Clearly attempting to appeal to both fans of the old VHS and newcomers, Disney didn't fully succeed with this DVD. They added several new songs to the beginning and end of the original footage and a narrator in between every song. It absolutely detracts from the original experience by nature, and it doesn't help that the new content isn't really of the same quality as the original stuff.I suppose I wouldn't tell fans of the VHS not to buy this, but be aware that it is not the same. It would have been really nice if they added an option to play just the original video, uncut.For anyone just looking for a decent holiday sing-along, this would probably be a great choice, and in that context I give it 4 stars. The 11 original songs are classic, and I'm guessing from a newbie perspective the new songs and narrator wouldn't be offensive (like they are to me, haha). The load of commercials at the beginning are annoying to skip through though, since it won't allow the menu button."
2,Not at all what i thought it was,Wanted to buy the original Disney very merry Christmas and this wasn't it. All new songs etc. Should have been renamed to avoid confusion-like I had.
3,Reminded me of my childhood,"I bought this DVD for nostalgic reasons. It definitely brought back fond childhood memories of spending the holidays at my grandparents while watching this sing-a-long tape (back when it was only on VHS). The only disappointing thing is that they've added a lot of new, corny songs that just don't fit and that I personally don't enjoy. However, this is a really fun DVD to put on for the kids to enjoy and sing along to."
5,songs CD,The grandkids all loved playing this throughout the entire holiday season-but beware some of the tunes stick in your head-forever!
3,Not what I expected,I loved this movie on VHS but they have changed it quite a bit for the DVD version and it is not as good. A lot of the songs don't seem to go with the video they chose. It is fun to watch but the kids don't pay as much attention to the newer ones that are not originally on the VHS one.
2,not as good as the original,"I bought this sing Along for my grandchildren because my children loved the original one so much. But this version has a man doing an intro to each song, it was annoying. When the songs just follow one another without the interuption of a voice seemed a better format to us."
4,What Christmas is all about!,"I agree with some of the other posts as far as being dated and maybe a little dry for children. I'm giving it 4 stars for the simple fact that it's so refreshing to actually hear traditional Christmas songs. I thinks most kids nowadays are really missing out on what we took for granted growing up. I especially like Silent Night and Joy to the World because Disney actually left the words ""Christ"" and ""Savior"" in there and that's getting harder and harder to find in this politically correct world we live in."
3,Boring! Kids Lost Interest!,"Got this for my kids to get them in the Christmas mood, but it was a waste. Like the fact that they go through popular Christmas songs that kids should know, and that the words are displayed at the bottom of the screen in a sing-a-long so they can follow along. And the scenes are taken from popular Disney classics so kids can watch the clips along with the music video. BUT the whole set-up of this DVD is very cheesy, not executed very well. They constantly show images of a model christmas village, and I often forgot i was watching a Disney DVD! I think if it were all cartoon it would be more enjoyable. Just thought this was boring, and my kids actually asked me to turn it off because of that! Waste of money personally!"
2,No pictures,Disappointed. No pictures Togo along with the recipes to see what the outcome is to be. Also. Many other ingredients are needed besides the ones put in the jar
5,mason jar soup to nuts,"This book is fabulous for gifts and ideas to help someone that does not have much money to give for a gift for someone . It is a true gift to give someone from the soul of your heart for medicine of love.Thank You,Wendy Mitchell"
3,Old Fashioned,"Many of the ideas and things listed in this book were too old-fashioned to fit my gift-giving needs, but would be good, if you knew exactly what was included here."
3,Nice Book,"I received this book as a Christmas gift. It seems to have a nice variety of recipes and is well-organized, with directions and helpful information up-front. I haven't used any of the recipes yet, but there are several that I'm looking forward to trying."
4,good,"Great ideas , just wished it would have had some pictures in color , i liked the coffee ideas alot"
4,OH YEA!,"I LOVE making gift jars, so this was what I hoped for. Great reipes! Fun and easy jars to make."
3,Recipes require too many ingredients,Most of the recipes require more than three additional ingredients to be added to the jar ingredients.Takes away from the convenience of having the jar mix.
3,"Okay, but book is better","I bought the book first and it has great tips on how to be spend less money and conserve more, which is what I was looking for. The series is pretty entertaining and gives some good motivation to be conservation minded. It's a bit annoying to see people tearing down perfectly good houses to build a more green house, or to see 2 people living in a huge house ""go green"" by replacing a few light bulbs with CFLs. I appreciate the Begley's for living as they preach though, so getting insights and tips from the way they live was good value. It's also nice that he doesn't judge anyone's efforts to conserve, no matter how small or how egregious their waste might be in other areas. As he says, low hanging fruit first and any improvement is good."
2,Surely this is a spoof?,"I cant tell if this is intended to be serious or is a spoof on green advocates. Such naieve people, creating tons of carbon to facilitate token installing some questionable green product. Obviously the concept of Life Cycle Analysis (LCA) is too large to fit Ed's head much less the show. If it is supposed to be serious, I give it one star. If it is supposed to be funny, I give it 3. and so the average is 2."
5,A super exploration of lunch beyond peanut butter & jelly,"Edith Baer's rhyming text explores lunch the world over, going far beyond the typical American lunch of peanut butter and jelly sandwiches. She uses simple couplets to cover everything from veggie burgers to tacos to fish chowder (in the United States) and then goes well beyond American borders to look at Colombia, Italy, Puerto Rico, Japan, England, Australia, China, India, and more.Not only do the lunches sound delicious (and teach children reading the book of the astonishing diversity of culinary habits the world over), but Steve Bjorkman's cheerful, colorful illustrations go a long way towards making the unusual seem utterly appetizing. This talented artist's work has appeared in national publications (he used to illustrate regularly for BETTER HOMES & GARDENS magazine, and I miss seeing his work there!). The simple lines and happy look of his pictures perfectly suit Edith Baer's text."
5,Great book for diversity lessons,I used this book (in conjunction with 3 others) to make a lesson plan about the history of immigration in the United States and diversity. Children really enjoy learning about what other kids do (and eat). I think this is a wonderful book to teach children about different cultures and customs.
1,Pretty Poor Excuse for Cutting String.,Cut two feet and re-load..... cut two feet and re-load.. that sums it up...
1,Waste of time and money,The original spool for my trimmer lasted about 6 years. The replacement from Amazon lasted about 6 minutes -less time than it took to install it. Complete junk! Worx 'gives away' packages of 6 spools with their new trimmers- which shows how long they are expected to last. Don't waste your money on Worx; they told me to get replacement parts from Amazon! NO stars.
5,The BEST Low-Carb Recipes Ever!,"It took a long time for me to catch on to the low-carb diet, but Brigit's book finally did it. Revel in her personal discovery of recipes that will leave you less hungry for trash foods, and satisfied beyond belief by her heavenly concoctions. Many food stories are shared with enthusiasm and personal satisfaction for choosing healthy options. It's a must for those in love with real food, while ex-ing out the carbs. You don't need to be on a diet to love The Low-Carb Gourmet!"
3,Unusual ingredients with some standout recipe ideas,"Since I began following a low carb eating plan a year ago, I keep on the lookout for interesting cookbooks. If you're a gourmet cook, you will probably really like this book; I am not and it really doesn't suit my simple menu style or my family's tastebuds. There are some interesting recipes I probably will try to expand my horizons, but it won't be a ""go to"" cookbook for me. Guess I should have considered the title!"
3,A little melodramatic,I bought this after reading the Transformers/GI Joe with Jae Lee. The drawing was stunningly dirty and the story was communicated through action. This reminded me a lot of Infinity Crisis (which people also love)- a lot of talk about what it means to be heroes and heroes in heroic poses.
2,"Pretty, But Overrated","This book won't likely impress anyone who isn't already enamored with Marvel Comics superheroes.On one hand, it's beautiful and vivid and even a bit haunting.But it's also somehow hollow.Consider- Everything is at stake for these characters: their home, their culture, even their lives. And yet it's all handled with such cold, distant narration that it's impossible, as a reader, to care.Little surprise, then, that in a collection of twelve dramatic, explosion-filled issues, the most striking and memorable moment is a quiet scene halfway through in which a normally unreadable character collapses to his knees at the side of his giant dog and hugs him.It's among the few moments of real weakness, conflict or feeling in the entire ponderous volume.The artwork usually manages to be delicate and intimate, but even the powerful illustrations can't compensate for a lifeless script.The Inhumans ultimately serves as a long, rich, vivid description of nothing."
4,Sony DCR-SR200,"Using this on an overcast day I flipped the camera to nightshot mode. So of course all photos take on the greenish hue. On an overcast day a great amount of detail was still washed out since the camera fully opens the aperture in nightshot mode. At dusk the Infrared effect is better, but still a little overexposed. Which means it is good for maybe a couple hours a day on this particular camera.I haven't been bale to test it indoors yet, but I'll try and see how it comes out. Hoping with the lower light levels indoors it will work out better.The filter itself is very nice, very clean, no problems that I can see with it."
4,Good Deal,"I recently fell in love with infrared photography, and figured an infrared filter was a must-have. I definitely am satisfied so far. After following Photoshop tutorials my pictures are looking pretty amazing. Before I bought this I did tons of research, and hoped that this was a good alternative to the expensive Hoya R72 filters. I've never used Hoya though before, but my bet is that this is the same filter, only cheaper. So far, so good. And as far as x-ray goes, I don't know if this works although after searching online I found that it is apparently possible since 100% cotton is supposedly transparent in the infrared light spectrum. Hope you don't buy this for that though! Great product!"
3,Does it really work?,This item is mainly advertised as an x-ray filter. I have tried it and it does NOT appear to work with my Sony with Nightshot. It doesn't seem to see thru anything. But I will keep it and see if it becomes useful for anything else.
1,Completely worthless - don't buy.,"I was anxious to get this in the mail because I wanted to enjoy cook infrared effect. Among the effects represented was the ability to ""see through"" clothing when photographing people. Well I am here to tell you that the filter is so dark that it is almost opaque. If I put this on my camcorder's lens (and I have a very sensitive camcorder) it makes the recorder completely useless. The screen is blacked out. In strong sunlight you can see just barely any image in the monitor. Don't waste your time on this totally worthless item. Does not even deserve one star. Unfortunately I waited too long to open the package after I received it so now I am stuck with this turkey."
5,"SVENVOLD: Serenades, Augury, and Elegies","SOUL DATA by Mark Svenvold is a poetic elegy to place, time, and family. In EVIDENCE, ""...liberty--/ how most of us have used ours up and carry/ what's left as we carry our bodies,/ pouting and untenable, from place to place--"". And in SEX FIEND SONNET: ""the wreck I've caused I am."" Serenades, augury, and elegies are all part of the mix here. Svenvold's western voice is as clear and as erotic as that of Hugo or Wright. The subject throughout this wonderful first collection seems to be the endurance of language and identity between the needed mountain and the histories of clouds, waves, and stone. SOUL DATA is a book well worth the read.Scott Hightower (72050.2350@compuserve.com)"
5,The Best Thing,This is such a good buy. It is so cheap here and it is the best deal! It is great quality!!
5,Same as down the street,"I knew what my order should have been, because I've been using this product for well over a year. So, the nicest part of the transaction was the price paid, and the savings on gas as I didn't have to travel to find it. It arrived earlier than expected. Thanks."
5,Epson T5570 PictureMate Color Ink and Paper Pack,This print pack is the cheepest set of ink and paper you can find. I placed a photo from the printer under a stream of water. It didn't effect it at all. Hats off to Epson for there PictureMate printer.
5,Best Value at Amazon,Amazon comes through bringing the same product at the lowest price. I bought two so I could qualify for free shipping and it was worth it. Hope the special pricing and free shipping continues!
2,Image count is bogus,"Epson says that you get 100 prints for roughly $30 or 29-32cents per print. Having gone through a whole bunch of their cartridges, this is bunk! At best you get through about 50 prints before the ink runs out.These bundles of paper and toner are a suckers bet from the company forcing you to build up piles and piles of expensive paper. If they appreciated their customers, they would offer a solo cartridge option"
5,Excellent Product!!,You really can get 100 prints from a single ink cartridge. Color and clarity are exceptional. A great buy!
2,low on ink,"Epson T5570 PictureMate Print Pack, GlossyAfter inserting print pack in Picturemate the cartridge showed 60% full, even though the expiration date on box was 2013. We are going to use the Picturemate for special pictures during the holiday season. We hope it will last that long."
1,"Great idea for a print cartridge, but doesn't work and promise advertised.","These are the results I got...Brand new package arrived from Amazon. Wife and I were happy to start printing pictures. We were expecting at least 50-80 pictures from the reviews posted here. The first picture we tried hardly printed at all. Cleaned the printer heads around 10 times and ran the nozzle check. Everything came out great on the nozzle check. The first 13 pictures after that came out great. Something you would expect from an economy printer. The pictures that printed after that started coming out very purple. The people in the pictures came out purple and it looked as if one color from the nozzle wasn't printing. I checked the cartridge status under maintenance and it showed about 15% of ink left! I was stunned! I did a nozzle check and the color ""yellow"" was completely gone. Complete waste of money! Cannot print anything without the color yellow working on the cartridge! Stay AWAY!!!"
4,epson picturemate refill t5570,"good product but no bargain . it was cheaper beforew on amazon but now its the same as everyone else (bestbuy, circuit city,etc)"
1,lack of information unacceptable,I agree with the WARNING review: It is simply unacceptable that the package does not clearly state which printers are compatible and which ones are incompatible with this product.
3,Picture Mate Print Pack Purchase,"Product arrived promptly. Only problem is that the expiration date of this product is 10/07 and I ordered it 1/31/08. I haven't used the product yet. I am hoping since the package is all sealed up, there will not be a problem. Perhaps it should have been noted that the expiration date had expired?"
2,Ink doesn't last,"I was happy, but I'm only getting 40-50 pictures from a cartridge. I've completed all maintenance, but I'm not getting pictures I can use. I have about 1000 sheets of paper, but no ink to print on them until I go back to the store to purchase another cartridge."
1,Wrong cartridge,I don't hate it I just opened it and discovered it was the wrong cartridge and now it is to late to return it. I guess I am stuck with it unless i can find someone with the right printer who needs it.
1,Careful! Don't order the wrong set,"I had wanted to get a refill package for my Epson Picture Mate Charm ..... (btw I absolutely love that little printer) ..... and ordered Picture Mate print pack T5570. IT WAS THE WRONG ONE! I unfortunately did not notice the mistake until AFTER I had opened the envelope for the cartridge in that pack. So I'll have to throw it out now. Fortunately, I can use the 100 pieces of photo paper that came with the package in my Picture Mate Charm.The correct refill package for the Picture Mate Charm is T5896. Since you usually will have discarded the box with this crucial info on it, I suggest that you stick a note on your little printer with the refill code T5896 to help you get the correct package always."
3,Declining Value,"Very pleased with quality of prints, but there are two problems preventing the printing of the advertised 100 prints per cartridge. I bought the Picturemate shortly after it began to be sold, and got nearly 100 prints from the original cartridge, though I had to buy extra paper, since it came with only 25 sheets. The latest cartridge, which I just bought and installed, is only 80% full, as reported by the printing program, and obviously will fall short of 100 prints. The second problem is that I have been printing infrequently, and had to discard the previous cartridge after maybe 50 or 60 prints, due to age and limited head-cleaning capacity. Despite the above, it still may be a good deal, provided that the price reflects these limitations. Still, if Epson is willing to reduce the capacity without saying so, they may well degrade the product more in future, in this or other ways."
4,"EXCELLENT PICTURES, BUT SHORT OF 100 PRINTS","I HAVE OWNED MY PICTUREMATE FOR OVER A YEAR NOW. PICTURES AREGREAT, THEY ARE BETTER QUALITY THAN WALGREEN'S OR WAL-MART.AFTER ABOUT 6 MONTHS OF OWNERSHIP, I FOUND THAT I HAD TO RUNTHE CLEAN HEAD TWO TO THREE TIMES BEFORE EACH PRINTING.ALSO THE CLAIM OF 100 PRINTS FALLS SHORT. OVER THE LAST YEARI HAVE 2 FULL BOXES OF 4X6 PAPER LEFT. I WOULD SAY MY AVERAGEIN ABOUT 85 PRINTS."
4,think ink,"first of all, everything everyone says about this ink is true: it's a noticeable step up from drugstore quality that produces frequently exquisite hi-gloss images with archival quality, blah blah blah. so why only 4 stars? i found myself printing up high-contrast night shots with a lot of black in them, which eats up the ink like a hungry hungry hippo. i only got about 60 photos total out of my ink pack, well short of the 100 promised and the 140-150 (!!!) some people have reported. so this is still a good deal for the money, and probably cheaper overall than buying individual ink colors, but if you shoot evening photos a lot, or high-contrast pics with a lot of dark spaces, you will go through these packs faster than daytime shooters. oh well, at least the ink isn't sitting around long enough to dry up. and the shots look fantastic. now if only the picture mate could do 8x10 or larger...."
5,good price,it is exactly what you would get in the stores but at a cheaper price.also you get the free shipping as it is over $25.great price!!!
1,bad ink,The cartridge was not the best...it was only 75% full when I rec'ed it and I had to do maintenance a few times before getting good pictures ...I'm not happy with it; and I purchased two!!!If I knew I was getting that quality I would have purchased refurbished cartridges...
5,Epson Picturemate ink pack,"An excellent product. It works perfectly with at least 3 models of the Epson Picturemate printers, producing clear, crisply-defined photos. The ink cartridge is said to be good for the 100 photos that you can make with the paper in the T5570 package, but it gets even better. my experience has been that the cartridge is good for about 30 or more photos than that, which means that if you buy a pack of 4 by 6 paper together with the T5570 package, you could, if you shopped the sales, save even more when you do your own photos. I see where Epson has now dicontinued the Picturemate, replacing it with newer products. I hope they keep producing the T5570 package for the Picturemates already in the field. This has been an great combination. After buying my Picturemate, I recently bought two others, at closeout prices, for my nieces. All units work flawlessly."
5,Great product !!,I have used this a lot. I left a few photos in the direct sun light just inside a non UV filtering window for over a year with no noticable fading !! Great color and the prints dry very fast. I usually get over 140 prints out of the ink cartarage. I tried HP paper from Sam's. It came out of my Epson Picture Mate sticky and foggy.
1,short life,I was disappointed with this product. After about 3 good pictures the ink started fading and the picture color was bad. Alot of expense for only three good ink prints.
3,"Great pictures, cheated on cartridge ink","First of all the printing cant be beat. But on the down side I just ordered my first package from Amazon and after installing, the digital ink monitor on the screen only show about 80% full. Hope I get my 100 pictures."
1,"""Compatible"" T5570 Ink Cartridge","I bought the ""Compatible"" ink cartridge from LD 2500 Grand Avenue, Long Beach, Ca. It leaked. It didn't work. It was a mess. I will buy only original cartridges from now on.The Epson Picture Mate is an excellent printer, however and produces hundreds of excellent pictures when the ink is good and the cleaning cycle is used regularly."
4,Great Prints - Cartridge Issue,"Love the print quality and speed. Gave 3 stars on ease of use, only because the ink cartridge doesn't last that long if not printing all the time. Just started removing the cartidge between printings to see if that improves how long it lasts."
1,3/4 FULL,"It is very easy to order the Picturemate Print Packs from Amazon. However, when I load them in my printer and print a picture, they always show 3/4 full and not totally full. Makes them run out quicker . . ."
3,picture perfect?!@#$,"This combo of ink and paper is great for the price however if you are a chronic photo developer such as myself, beware of the fact that the ink will run out after about 70 printed sheets of pictures which will leave you with 30 blank sheets which will obviously require ink."
1,I hate Epson for making me buy these,I hate Epson for requiring these. Refills work great.... until you need to clean the print head. Epson will not let you do that unless you have one of their own cartridges in the printer. When the picture quality goes down you have to put in an origional and throw away the refill as it will leak if reinstalled. Don't ask how I know! I will never buy another Epson product as they clearly don't care that I bought their expensive product they really want the ink-paper money. I have hundreds of pages of extra paper as you cannot get 100 prints from an ink cartridge if you ever clean the heads. Why not sell a cartridge for a reasonable price to let me use up some paper?
5,Epson Picturemate print pack,Not able to find this product in the stores and so I was unable to use my picturemate until I found the cartridge here on Amazon. So happy to have it and now I am printing pictures galore.
3,Unnecessary addon,"It is annoying that Epson does not sell cartridges alone, but blackmails you into buying paper even if you need only an Epson cartridge. Next time I will buy a cartridge from a non-Epson supplier that can offer just the cartridge you need, not an obligatory cartridge+paper combination."
2,Cartridge Doesn't Last,"The ""feature"" that I do not like about this cartridge is that if you do not print a lot of pictures, or if you do not print often enough, the ink starts to dry out.The last cartridge only produced 52 prints before it was empty. This works out to $0.55 per print (at Amazon's price).Is this better than uploading them to Walgreens/CVS/Walmart/etc. and paying $0.19 per print and picking them up 1 hour later?"
3,condescending,"I couldn't put this book down, i'll give it that much.But I didn't always like it.While the narration was interesting and fairly well written, I felt a rather pretentious, and quite condescending air as he described the mongolians he met and the way in which they lived.The descriptions of the landscape were beautiful, but it didn't hide the fact that I felt Stewart was narrating a 4 star resort tour of the country instead of what was supposed to be a wilderness trek.None the less, I found it hard to put it down, maybe because the historial bits were so intruiging."
1,Humiliating,"An insult to all Mongolians. In my Mongolian extensive travels I never saw Mongolians as this writer describes them. Instead I found the Mongolians to be kind, considerate and a joy to meet. This author needs to rethink his writing motives. Just to be humerous he degrades fine poeple. Not a book I would recomend."
4,"In the Empire of Genghis Khan, by Stanley Stewart","Stewart writes a vivid, often humorous and always enthralling memoir on his adventuresome trip through Mongolia. His affection for these beautiful people radiates throughout the book. His historical perspective on this little known warrior is enlightening. The colorful descriptions of the countryside are tantalizing. While revealing the history of th Communist takeover, he whets the appetite for one's own trip to this gorgeous landscape."
5,An Excellent Read,"I've always been intrigued by the Mongols, as they are at the edge between settled and nomadic people. And I've also always like travel writing. Stanely Stewart's book therefore made me very happy. It is beautifully written and the research is thorough. I learned about the Secret History of the Mongols in one section and in another found one of my favorite senteces in any book. I do not have my copy with me, but the sentece included truck repair, camels, and Uzbeks.Mr. Stewarts book is too good to be called a travel memoir and to lively to be called a history book. It is one of the most entertaining and informative books I have read."
5,An Exellent Book,This book is an exellent book for anyone who wants to learn how to survive in the wild without having to depend on help from someone else. Its got exellent information and itd definitely hepled me.
4,Excellent Information,"This is a wonderful book to read if you are wanting to go into the outdoors and handle your own survival. Pictures are well illustrated and presented and very realistic. If you plan on spending some time in the wilderness this is a must read with insightful information in the event you were stranded or lost. Allan MacFarlan did a good job with lots of information to absorb if you are considering camping, hiking or exploring onyour own."
1,Poor Choice.,"The subject matter of this book is very poor for anyone serious about the subject. Most of the ideas a very simplistic. Any outdoorsman knows these things, many are contrived and simply of no use. With the availability of the internet, this book is just not useful. Save your money."
2,Basic info realy,"I thought this book was about tracking and what not, it's more about primitive traping. I feel that most of the info in this book is general knowledge."
2,sad,I guess if you never bin in the woods before. Never learned anything about survival in the woods. This book would be ok if it was the first out door book you have ever read.
5,"A unique view, incredibly well written","You can agree or disagree with Serge, but you shouldn't ignore him.He was in the midst of the biggest revolutions of the 20th century and managed to escape death multiple times. He's by no means a perfect human being, even disconsidering our modern bias toward his points of view, but the idealism is very interesting and frankly, sounds a bit romantically naive. That said, this is a treaty on following your radical ideas to the max and is incredibly well written. It's an autobiography by a master novelist.I just wish there was a kindle version, it would greatly ease the pain of having to go back and forth to the (excellent) reference material in the end."
2,"Heart, but not nearly enough soul.","Be well advised that this extremely slender volume (whose reading time can be counted in minutes, not hours) is NOT the next ""A Walk In The Woods"" or ""Neither Here Nor There"" the hard-core Bryson fan has been waiting for since 1998.Sure... it's pure Bryson, and the profits and royalties go to a much-deserving cause (CARE)... but all in all it's just 50 tiny, well-spaced pages that just don't add up to a good value for voracious travel readers.If you feel need the need to give to charity: Write a check to the Salvation Army or the American Red Cross or your local fire and police departments. The only reason I didn't return this ""book"" for a refund was the charity angle -- otherwise I was personally disappointed from start to finish (which fortunately lasted less than 20 minutes)."
4,Too short,"Very short book but great insight into Bryson's trip around Kenya at the behest of CARE International, to which he donated all the proceeds. I was left wanting more and think that would have been easy for Bryson to give to his readers without a lot of effort. But how can one fault his intentions to make us more aware?Guess I will have to read more about present-day Kenya someplace else. My first interest in Kenya occurred back in the late 80s when I read Barbara Wood's amazing GREEN CITY IN THE SUN. Why this book never was a best-seller is beyond me."
4,CARE,"I read Bill Bryson's book on my way to Europe. A great little carry along that doesn't take up much space, and doesn't take long to read. I love the fact that humor is mixed in with the seriousness of what the book really covers. It is great that all profits go to help the CARE cause."
5,OK it is short but the cause is great!,"OK it is rather short but the cause is great and Bryson really does convey his care for the people of Africa. So buy this book, buy one for each of your friends and make sure that they do the same. You will have a light but fun read and meanwhile you will have helped a lot of people who urgently need it. Christopher Catherwood (author of CHRISTIANS, MUSLIMS AND ISLAMIC RAGE, Zondervan, 2003)"
5,Five stars for Bryson and Giggil used books...,"Finished ""African Diary"" in one lovely afternoon. Superbly written with three full pages of colored photos both visually and technically appealing.Currently reading three other Bryson titles. All are written with luscious, descriptive detail so artfully accomplished that it feels as though I am standing next to Bryson observing as he is writing.About this used book: hard cover copy received from ""Giggil"" in pristine condition."
4,An Honest & Funny Short Story for a worthy cause,"Typical Bill Bryson - funny, honest, full of interesting facts. Nice to know that purchasing the book (albeit a short story really) went to a worthy cause."
2,Not Really Up to Bryson Standards,"I love Bill Bryson and find his writing entertaining, informative, and sincere. While the intentions behind this book are worthy it is clearly neither a true diary nor comparable to the rest of his catalogue. It is surprisingly short -- only about 49 pages and appears to be merely an afterthought or hastily written magazine article turned into a book. I consider a ""Short History of Nearly Everything"" and ""A Walk in the Woods"" among my favorite books of all time. So on a recent flight in Africa I thought this book would make great reading to pass the time. It was way too short and left me unsatisfied. There are hints of Bryson's normal eloquence and wit along with his keen powers of observation. But mostly this reads like a pamphlet. Download it cheaply on a Kindle but I don't recommend buying the hardcover version at this price regardless of the charity to which the money goes."
2,quick read,"The African Diary was written in Bill Bryson's usual humorous style, but it seemed like he just whipped out this book because of an obligation. I read it in less than an hour so it was less than entertaining."
3,I give this book a PASS,"I enjoy reading travel books and unfortunately, this doesn't qualify. I finished the book just as quickly as I started. In my opinion, this is more of a travel pamphlet compared to a book. It's definitely a deviation from Bill Bryson's norm."
4,great story + fundraiser too,"Well written in the classic Bryson easy-conversational style. The reader will feel as if they've made a fast journey to Kenya themselves.I was displeased when I first rec'd in the mail my copy of Bill Bryson's African Diary, having purchased it on-line because of how much I've enjoyed his body of work. Initially the price seemed too high for what is really a glorified magazine article. Only when I read that the book was a special fundraising project for wonderful African charitable works did my faith in the author's integrity return. As he says in the book, the purchase price is really a donation and the book is just a happy (and well written) side benefit."
4,A very entertaining short read!,"I am a big fan of Bill Bryson's writing, and this book is no exception.The entire book is under 50 pages long, but it is an extremely entertaining look at life in Africa, and what goes into a normal trip to an African country.I can't say the book has me convinced to visit Kenya, but I did enjoy reading about Mr. Bryson's trip.As a bonus, a large percentage of the profits from the book go to support the CARE charity which is doing a lot of good work in developing countries worldwide.I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in traveling to Africa."
2,VERY disappointing; a sell-out?,"It is, of course, my own fault that I didn't read the details concerning Bill Bryson's African Diary. Had I realized it was only 49 pages long - in total, roughly the length of two chapters in a typical Bryson book - I never would have made the purchase.Instead of getting the usual engaging and charming detailed minutiae of a Bryson book, we get what is largely long captions for photos taken by his co-author and sweeping generalizations about one of the world's most unknown, misunderstood and important continents. Please go back to Africa, Mr. Bryson, and write the book(s) that only you can write to help us appreciate this wonderland.Bill Bryson's African Diary"
4,A great book,"After reading Bill Bryson's brilliant A WALK IN THE WOODS, I was expecting much of the same in AFRICAN DIARY. That is not what I found. This little book was written for a totally different reason, and his stay in Kenya was much shorter than the time he spent on the Appalachian Trail (the subject of the of the previous book). Even though he was in Kenya a very short time, he witenessed life of poverty among luxury and painted vivid word pictures of how people live in a developing country and shows that in midst of poverty and deprivation live some of the most wonderful people on the face of the earth. Anyone contemplating a trip to a developing country should surely read this book to prepare them for what they will face. Those who have never visited such a country will have their eyes opened to an entirely new way of life. This book will make you laugh one minute and cry the next. I cannot wait to read more of his books."
1,is this a joke?,"I like Bill Bryson but passing off a 49-page (no, it's not 69 pages in the version I got) diary as a book is a crime. Charging C$19 for that, too, is a ripoff (that's the price I saw it at a bookstore in town).I don't really care that the proceeds are going to CARE. If you want to support CARE just give them the $19. To pay for this atrocity which is basically an account of a week Bryson spent in Kenya. Yes, folks, it's actually a ""Kenyan"" diary as that's all of the entire continent of Africa he sees.There are also 19 color pics in the ""book."" Of which Bryson's beard appears in six. Writing this as the ""Man With Cigar"" at the 2010 Ryder Cup get photoshopped into various pics and is an Internet sensation for this nanosecond, I got the feeling, ""Do they really think putting Bryson's beard in a bunch of pics = more sales?""Anyway, very very disappointing and it's written as if Bryson mailed it in. You or I could have easily done a far better job with this diary format than Bryson."
3,Very thin re-telling of Un-Bryson-like trrip,Don't get this thinking you are getting another superb series of Bryson's observations.He did a quickie trip for some aid organization and seems to have lept from hotel bar to hotel room with an occasional drive-by of some needy Africans.
1,Not worth the money.,I was really surprised to find such a short little book in the mailbox. It looks like about a one hour effort by the author.
3,a great cause,"this book was short, but what can you expect when he only spends a week there? he brings the reality of africa and kenya and all of the proceeds go to CARE."
1,Bill Bryson's African Diary,I am a Bill Bryson fan but this book is a rip-off. There is only enough content for a New Yorker major article but it has been spun out into a tiny book.I understand he is trying to make money for CARE but scamming a reader is not the way to do it!
4,A message delivered with gentle humor,"The book may be short, but its purpose is to provide funding for CARE International (who could teach the U.S. Government a thing or two about helping to ""nation-build""--I propose we give CARE several billion dollars and tell them to restore Iraq and Afghanistan--we would save tons of tax dollars and American lives and the job would be done correctly!!). Anyway, Bill Bryson teaches us a lot with his humor. It is educational without being preachy--but the message is a strong one. I only wish the trip had been longer so the book could be longer! (How about an extensive tour through Africa, Mr. Bryson? I'm sure CARE would provide you with a snakebite kit!). Meanwhile, I'm adding CARE to my list of charity donations--I can't give a lot but at least I know it will be well spent."
4,Compassionate,"Concise, well writen as one expects from Bill Bryson and very funny at times. It made me want to read more about Africa."
3,Too short!,I didn't realise this was going to be such a short book and only limited to his experience in Kenya......I think the title of the book may have been a little misleading. What there was of it was of course written in Bill's usual entertaining and interesting way....I just would've liked to have read a lot more about Africa...hopefully he'll go back and do a complete book on this very interesting continent.
2,Nasty Rip Off,very short story- beware buy kindle edition if you think you are getting a novel. This is a smarmy little fund raiser
4,To short but a good read and for a good cause!,"My only complaint is that this book is way to short - more like a short story that can be read in one sitting. But, it is for a good cause and does describe places and conditins that I would otherwise have been unaware of. The read is typical Bryson with colorful vignettes."
4,"Very short, somewhat inspirational.","This is by no means an in-depth study of Kenya, or even CARE's role there. It is, however, concise, funny, and sufficient to personalize the struggles many people face and make you (or at least me) want to learn more about what CARE and similar organizations do."
3,Bill Bryson African Diary,Should be titled: Bill Bryson's Very Short Diary of some Kenyan CARE International locations. At least the royalties and profit go to the CARE charity!
4,interesting,"this is a very short book which was written for charity, but it's interesting and definitely worth reading. I always find Bill Bryson very entertaining"
2,Not his usual wit and insight,"Disappointing Bryson book. Esentially a promo for CARE, which does great work, but not really much to it. Donate directly instead if you want to support CARE."
1,false pretenses,"I purchased what i thought was a book,it turned out to be a short report on a trip to part of Africa by Bill Bryson for to promote a charity.I realise that profits went to the charity but that was not made clear and I felt that it was marketed in a spurious manner."
4,Just not enough!,"I love Bill Bryson's books, and my only ""complaint"" about this one is that it's just not long enough. He has such wonderful descriptions, and Africa deserves at least 300 pages!"
2,Bill Bryson's African Diary,"I love Bill Bryson's humor. I was disappointed in this book because it did not portray his usual hilarious wit. As I discovered once I received the book, it was written for the purpose of helping a charity. That of course was honorably performed by Mr. Bryson, but not knowing this at the time of purchase left me with a lot to be desired. There was no story, no character building, and very little to relate to the culture and people of Kenya. Hopefully the non profit received monies from my purchase of the book as there was little content otherwise. I just feel the buyer should be made better aware of the purpose of this writing prior to purchase."
3,His heart is in the right place,"It's short. It's a pleasant read. It's honest, both about Kenya itself and the author's general ignorance of Africa. A good effort, and the profits go to support a supposedly good cause (that's another subject) . . . overall, ""Bill Bryson's African Diary"" doesn't add up to much, but it's better than nothing, which is what he could have done when CARE asked him to take a trip and produce a manuscript. ""A"" for effort. Bill Bryson fans may want to read it. If you want to learn about Africa or the aid biz, better to look elsewhere."
3,Light on Bryson-ian humor,"I enjoyed this book, despite its short length. I have to give kudos to any author who writes a book with the sole intent of helping others. (The proceeds from this book go to CARE). That said, it was not filled with Bill Bryson's usual make-me-snort-milk-out-my-nose humor. I suspect that perhaps there is not very much to laugh about on a continent that is experiencing the worst AIDS epidemic in the world along with droughts, famine, and civil war in various places. Despite all its heaviness, there is an occasional ray of sunshine peeking through in the form of the lovely photos of the people and places Bill Bryson saw while he was there."
4,Bryson Helps Out CARE,This small book tells the story of Bill Bryson's journey to Africa on behalf of CARE. All proceeds from the book are donated to CARE. Bryson tells how his childhood images of Africa derived primarily from television and movies fit with reality. He witnesses the extreme poverty but warm openness of the African people. This is a very brief book with both funny and touching scenese. And it's for a good cause.
2,Bill Bryson's African Diary,This book did not have any of the comic timing I have come to expect with Bryson. It read more like a promotional pamphlet for Care Inc. I would not recommend.
1,A Waste of Money,"I enjoyed Bryson's ""A Walk in the Woods"" and recently bought a few of his other books, the ""African Diary"" included. As a Kenyan reading this book, he had nothing but negative things to say. It felt like the only positive experience he had was seeing all the fossils of early man that he was ""honoured"" to see, since these exhibits are not open to the general public. I found my blood boiling as I kept reading, and to be honest, I had to keep willing myself to finish reading it. I kept looking for hope, but there seemed to be none. This book portrayed Kenya as a bleak place-- like it is a death sentence to be there. Yes, I acknowledge that Kenya has many, many problems, just like every other country does, but there are lots of things that are wonderful about it. Honestly, whoever would like this book can contact me, and I will gladly mail it to you FREE. I really have no use for it, and do not want it sitting on my bookshelf."
3,"A book, not a pamphlet","This is a book, not a pamphlet. You can tell by the price. Apparently, writing a check to CARE is too complicated, so they created this 64 page pam--book, cut Amazon in for some, a publisher in for some, and send maybe a quarter to CARE.Still, the early pages of the pambophoklet contain jokes and asides, and the later pages contain more, and there are color pictures, which surely means it's a book, not a pamphlet.If you like CARE, and you're not sure what their mailing address is, can't use Google, or don't have a checkbook anyway, this is the book for you. Fortunately, unlike many books in this price range, this one is very easy to finish, and it's more entertaining than most pamphlets on Africa, which tend to be longer to boot."
3,Donate $12 to charity and get this book as a thank-you gift,"CARE International, a global charity, invited travel writer Bill Bryson to visit Kenya to write about the group's programs there. This book is the result. The total text is about the length of a long magazine article in an outlet such as Vanity Fair or The New Yorker, and there are about a dozen pages of high-quality color pictures.All the proceeds are donated to CARE. In effect, you're donating $12.00 to charity to read a very positive magazine story about CARE International. Bryson is a talented writer, his accounts are interesting, and CARE is a good organization.So, overall I felt it was a good deal but the book is not particularly distinguished beyond this. It's not Bryson's best writing, but it's good enough. The most effective bits concern his fear of flying in small planes, as opposed to the people he meets. His discussion of CARE is a straightforward puff piece, but I can live with that."
