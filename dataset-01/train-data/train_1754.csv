5,this is one of the best,this is one of the best cure cds! the reissue sounds great! totally does it justice. highly recommended for all cure fans!!
4,Welcome to the dark side.,"""Pornography"" isn't my favorite album of theirs, but if you're drawn to the darker side of the band, this is definitely what you want. ""Faith"" and ""Disintegration"" do the trick too, but not like this. Songs like ""100 Years"" and ""The Figurehead"" are excellent, and will show you how upbeat and happy the ""Greatest Hits"" songs really are. ""Cold"" is a perfect name for that song, and my personal favorite track is ""A Strange Day"". Overall it's a great album, and a must for real ""Cure"" fans, except for those under the age of 18, they shouldn't have ""Pornography""."
5,hide the razor blades!,"Easily, without doubt, one of the most wretchedly depressing, sorrowful, and downright scary albums ever recorded. Don't let anyone fool you when they tell you that The Cure was never a Goth band. This is proof enough. Sure their future experimentations would influence other, more upbeat alternative styles, but the darkness and dispair on this masterpiece rivals any black metal band... not to say that this is in anyway similar to black metal, it's not in the least, but it's definitely just as disturbing. It would be fair to say that this, along with Faith and Seventeen seconds is just as influential on modern Goth music as anything put out by The Sisters or Bauhaus. No wonder so many of us Dark Ones adore this band. Danger! Not recommended for people with suicidal urges, or clinical depression."
4,Creepy?,"I didn't think it was creepy, more angsty with a dancey flare... I don't think there is much to say that hasn't been already said.. So I'll say that the only thing i didn't like about this cd is that the songs become a little redundant... other than that, it was really good..My favorite song, was cold.. I thought it important to note the almost danky organ and synth sound on this song... very dark in atmosphere, and just plain rules...... goth at its core, hmph"
2,Wait for remaster,"You know what, it's not a bad album at all, but, if I were you and if you're a fan, which would in turn make you like me, I'd wait for the digital remaster due out in a few months. I actually love this album, but the sound is kind of murky, and the singer himself has said that the record company messed up the CD mastering, which he intends to supervise this time around. It'll also contain an extra disc of bonus sides."
4,All you need,"The Cure is one of those cases where an obsessive and highly vocal fanbase gives an exaggerated impression of the band's importance. This is their best album and the only one you really need, with the possible exception of 'Disintegration'. All the others are an enervating combination of self-indulgent whining and nauseating tweeness. 'Pornography' is the genuine, horrifying sound of over-privileged adolescents completely out of touch with reality, and so can be recommended without reservation to potential fans."
5,Worth spending money on the upgrade.,"I have been thinking of getting Pornography or Seventeen Seconds in the newly remastered expanded form. I bought Seventeen Seconds first because I wanted to hear The Forest. The extras on that release are not that great, but it was still worth it. This is definitely worth the money. It sounds much better, and the extras are cool. The demos of some of the songs are really good, especially The Hanging Garden Demo, which has a real cool Robert Smith rhythm guitar sound. The live versions are also very good. The sound isn't tip top on a few of them, but they are great performances and the sound quality isn't bad enough to make you not want to listen. The Pornography release is worth the upgrade."
5,haunting happy music,"I don't know why people would call this depressing. Yes, this music is set in minor key. But, it is absolutely beautiful. It should make you happy. A definite addition to anyone's collection especially if you are a Cure fan, or a fan of gothic or darkwave music."
3,i was upset with this,"i was hopeing that the cure's sound would stay that of faith,but this one is nothing like the cure before or the cure after.,The best song on here is a strange day good song but it still is well below there songs from faith.,robert smith if you read this go back to the faith album and work from there.no more love songs no more go back when your music was mellow and your words very powerfull..This is probaly the worse of the cure.But worth haven for the song a strange day,.a blind man kissing my hand.."
2,Why Remaster?,"Normally I love to hear my favourite albums remastered, and God knows there are plenty of '80s albums that desperately need it (Psychocandy!). However, I think that the decidedly murky sound quality of this album was its best feature. Let's face it, this really isn't the Cure's best album. My personal favourites are 'Faith' and 'The Head On The Door', but 'Pornography' had always seemed really good. That is, until they remastered it. Sure, now you can hear every 'nuance', but on top of that you can also hear just how frightfully mediocre the songs are. With the old version, it sounded like the band recorded the album at the bottom of a swamp, and that seemed to work really well with the overall sound and feel of the album. But now that it sounds all clean and clear, you realise just how weak this album was in the first place. To the original version of the album, I give four stars. But to this remaster, I give two."
1,"My God, This Is Even More Awful Than the Original!","Imagine how you would feel if your hands were tied behind your back while somebody held the spinning blades of a screamingly loud gas-powered lawnmower up to your face. That is the sound of `Pornography'. On this album, the atmospherics of previous albums melt into chaos, until nothing is left but the brain-numbing hum of impending death. I could scream, if only I weren't so bored.`Pornography' is the Frankenstein version of `Faith' and ""Seventeen Seconds'. It takes all of the bits that made those albums interesting and good, and renders them into something monstrous and hideous.While parts of `Faith' might have sounded like it was recorded underwater, this collection makes me wish that someone would throw a toaster into the tub. D+ Tom Ryan"
5,This was by beginning...,"It was the summer of 1983 when I first heard this recording on cassette. The gal that introduced me to it was very cute, so needless to say I had a thing for her.I was almost 17 and heavily into hardcore punk, and this (Along with Joy Division) seemed like such a stretch from the caterwauling guitars and rapid fire vocals I had been listening to. I went into the Navy the following summer, and after boot camp, the first thing I did was buy a walkman and this cassette. Next I bought ""Faith"" and ""Seventeen Seconds"".Without a doubt, Pornography has to be my favorite of the 3 greatest recordings of the era..."
5,approach with caution,"without going to great length's to explain the genius of this album- all i'll say is that if at any point you feel an urge to soundtrack your despair......... nothing in the history of rock music can touch this album for sheer devastation. It is without doubt THE most depressing (relentlessly so) album that i have ever heard.So to sum up..........if listening to the sound of desparation appeals to you, you'll treasure this album. If however you prefer the lighter moments of the cure and dont find the prospect of time standing still and the walls closing in on you, appealing enough, DO NOT buy this record."
5,almost as good as Disintegration!!!!,This is a very good cd(almost as good as Disintegration in fact)and I am very glad I bought it.I do have to admit though that at first I found the drums to be kinda annoying but they quickely grew on me.
5,The Ideal Cure Album,"This is the Cure at their peak. Perfectly balanced...a little bit of pain, a smattering of bliss, and touchingly haunting. A unique album...one that stands out high and far above the rest. If you're unsure what exactly ""goth"" music is, this is the album that will explain it to you in a thousand musical notes. Words cannot capture what impact this particular album has had upon me and how much it moulded my desires to learn more....there is a darker world out there and I want to find it..."
3,better for kindergarten kids not toddlers,"I bought this sweet book for my toddler but when we received the bock I was a lil bummed. Its more for kindergarten- age..the images are just to small for toddlers to understand the meaning of the words. Still a great book tho, we'll just keep it till its the right time for my little one."
3,Good introduction for kids and beginning adult learners.,"A quick and easy introduction to the German language.My kid picked it up and started reviewing it on her own which says volumes about the accessibility and presentation of the materials. Not only are the words defined but there is a brief sentence included which demostrates the grammatical usage of the word.The only real shortcoming is the lack of a pronunciation key. The failure to include this important aspect of language training is the reason I gave this product review 3 stars.Overall this is a good beginner book for identifying the basic written German translations of many common everyday items. Those looking for more advanced help in the area of speech, pronunciation and diction should definitely look elsewhere."
5,Great!,Really like the lay out of this book! Very user friendly. Has the english right next to the german. My 15 yr old was able to pick it up and start saying words right away.Highly recommend!
5,"""Weird Al"" Kicks ... Again","This CD is great. ""Coach Potato"" is one of his best parodies on this album, aside from the ""Ode To A Superhero"" which is sure to become a hit with all Billy Joel fans. Over all, a terrific album, and I hope that we see another in less than four years. Go to a concert. You'll never see a show like Al's!!!"
5,More fun than a Polka Party at a Leper Colony!,"A great album all around. It's been getting better and better with each listen. This one might take a bit of work for some people to get. For example, I've seen a couple of people here criticize ""Genius in France"". I think the song is pure genius. And once you realize that Al wrote it in the style of Frank Zappa, you'll get it, too.Overall, a better effort than Running with Scissors and a great disc altogether."
2,Weird Al Fan ..I Have Most Of His Cds..I can tell you why.,Ok on this cd sounds like he tryd to hard to get what he wantedthe songs that sound alike are...Couch P. & SpiderMan & Trash Dayhowever #2 is a nice one as well ...what I didnt like about this cd was what he says in his lyrics...if you get the cd read ebay's lyrics...I HATE NSYNC lol...but thats not why I hate this song like I said read and you will seeanyways after playing the cd over and over it gets to sound like kid songs who wants to be listing to a kid song ? im talking early 14...you know ? lolwell anyway its ok if you dont play it all the time I guess I would get it at a lower price if I could so go look around at prices first...well Im out'a here people dont be blasting weird al or you will be laughd at lolOk I gave 2 stars cause I for one didnt like all the songs I just liked a few
5,Excellent!,"I have noticed that when the music is terrible, ""Weird Al"" works better. In this new album, he parodies ""Lose Yourself"" by EMINEM, ""So Hot In Here"" by Nelly, ""Complicated"" by Avril Lavigne, ""Piano Man"" By Billy Joel, and ""I want it that way"" By the Backstreet Boys. All crappy songs, great parodies. He has one of his best originals on here, too: ""Why does this always happen to me?"" Here is a breakdown:1) Couch Potato (Parody of Lose Yourself) 10/102) Hardware Store (Original) 7/103) Trash Day (Parody of So Hot In Here) 10/104) Party at the Leper Colony (Original) 8/105) Angry White Boy Polka (Polka) 8/106) Wanna B Ur Lovr (Original) 8/107) A Complicated Song (Parody of Complicated) 10/108) Why Does This Always Happen To Me? (Original) 10/109) Ode to a Superhero (Parody of Piano Man) 9/1010) Bob (Original) ??/10 (I haven't heard this one yet)11) Ebay (Parody of I Want it That Way) 10/1012) Genius In France (Original) 9/1099/110=90%A great album. I highly recommend"
5,Weird Al Makes Another Successful CD,This CD is another in a long line of excellent comedy/parady albums produced by Weird Al. I have been listening to him since his Dr. Demonto days back in the early 80's. He only gets better with age. You have to see him in concert to truely appreciate his comic genius.
5,best cd ever,this is one of al's best cds it will give you hours of enjoyment and the enhanced cd features are a great added treat showing some of al's home movies!
5,Wierd Al's Poodle Hat,"An absolutely awsome collection of songs! Great job with Ebay and well, all of them! Definantly recommended to all."
4,Not As Good As Lynwood,"Couch Potato: 4/5 Better than the original, but still, if you don't like rap, skip it.Hardware Store: 5/5 Like, the best song on the album, dude.Trash Day: 5/5 Funny, but the background vocals get repetitive.Party At The Leper Colony: 2/5 Hate it, not my style, but you still may like it more than me.Angry White Boy Polka: 5/5 Pretty good, longest polka he's done.Wanna B Ur Lovr: 2/5 Cheesiest lines ever, and I don't like it.A Complicated Song: 5/5 Great song. First got me started on Weird Al.Why Does This Always Happen To Me?: 4/5 Good, but gross.Ode To A Superhero: 5/5 Great. Sums up a 2 hour long movie in under 5 minutes.Bob: 3/5 Hey, you gotta give him credits for those couplets and palindromes.Ebay: 5/5 WAY better than the original. It's Funny.Genius In France: 5/5 Long, but it's like a song on a roller coaster."
5,Worth it just for the Zappa Tribute,"While the entire album is very good - I'd love to see ""Hardware Store"" done live, I'm going to focus on the last and (in my opinion) best track of all.""Genius in France"" is an absolutely tremendous piece of work, simultaneously making fun of the French and Jerry Lewis (two Zappa pastimes) while hitting nearly every signature Frank Zappa style. I don't have the album handy as I write this, but I believe Dweezil played the opening guitar riff at the very least, and I would almost swear that Ike Willis is in the mix somewhere. If Frank were still alive he'd probably wish HE'd written this track - and that's the highest praise available. I really hope Al performs this tune on the tour."
2,Unexpected Low,"While normally a fan this is the first Weird Al album that I've rather heavily disliked. Some of it is mildly amusing, but he has apparently decided that MTV is still a relevant model of popular culture. Most of the references are pointless and seem to be very short-lived as are most of the parodies. The only time I've heard any of the parodied songs with the exception of ""Piano Man"" was while channel-flipping or out shopping. Unlike previous work these song had no need to be parodied and will be quickly forgotten. ""Bob"" was ham-fisted and entirely unoriginal, seemingly the work of a complete novice with no sense of humour.I had expected good things after his last two excellent albums, but this is more in line with ""Polka Party"" and ""Alapalooza"". This is the first output by Al that I feel no desire to own at all."
3,Not his best but some good songs,"This one didn't quite do it for me. I am a huge Weird Al fan but this album left me wanting. There are a couple of stand outs. ""Party at the Leper Colony"" and ""Bob"" were hysterical, the former also being a great tune. If you are an Al fan then you will want to add this to your list there just may be a few songs that you will skip over in the future."
4,Good Al-Bum,This is a Good Weird Al Album But No Way As Good As The Previous Running With Sciccors here's The Track Ratings1.Couch Potato 9/102.Hardware Store 8/103.Trash Day 8/104.Party At The leper Colony 7/105.Angry White Boy Polka 9/106.Wanna B Ur Lovr 8/107.A Complicated Song 10/108.Why Does This always Happen To me 8/109.Ode To A Superhero 6/1010.Bob 10/1011.Ebay 9/1012Genious in France 8/10
5,Buy this CD,"Look, I might be a kid but trust me when I say this is one of the most freak'in hilarious CDs on earth. Some of the parodied artists on this CD are Eminem, Nelly, Avril Lavigne, and The Backstreet Boys. This review might not be helpful but I don't care. Just buy the CD!!!"
5,Exelent CD...Greatest of his albums,"El Teriffico... Definently one of als best cd's. Hillarious songs, you should definently buy this cd.Although I really dont know why anyone would buy a cd anymore. (if you ask me cd's are sooooo 90's) what you should do is get a good trustworthy illigal...um i mean ""legal""... mp3 downloader and get the album on MP3 like I did. But if your a goody goody person who doesnt like to brake any laws then buy the cd. Besides what are the odds the FBI is gunna come to your door anyway...just a sec someones at my door.... hello..., hey let me go what do you mean you have a warrant for arrest... hey you cant do this to me...Im innocent INNICENT I TELL YOU!NOOOOO!..."
3,4 out of 12,"I dearly love Weird Al. He's brilliant and deserves many accolades. That being said, Poodle Hat is not his best effort. There are 4 songs, however, that are outstanding. Tracks 1, 7, 9, 11 are superb and deserve 5 stars. Is it worth the price to get 4 terrific songs? You decide.Many of the other songs are just downers. And not in a funny way. Not like ""You Don't Love Me Anymore"". Al sounds more angry than usual on this album. Too bad."
4,My Two Cents,"This album has already been reviewed a lot, so I don't know if my opinion will count for much, but I would like to say a few things about it. I have been a Weird Al fan for over 20 years now. In fact, the first concert I ever attended was by Weird Al. All these years later, Al is still doing a lot of the same thing he always did. Song parodies, songs about television, polka medleys, etc. But his writing has become more sophisticated over the years. I know it sounds dumb to say that a song about watching too much TV can be sophisticated, but it's true. I'm not going to go over every song on this album, but let's take ""Bob"", for an example. It must be hard to write a whole bunch of palindromes. So, imagine how difficult it must have been to write a song made up of palindromes, and have it actually rhyme, which it does. Anyway, if you like Al as much as I do, you probably already bought this album. And if you didn't buy it, what are you waiting for?"
3,Borrow Before You Buy!!!,"Ok, I know most people will think very little of me for judging an album and only listening to it for a day. First of all ""you"" have to be a weird al fan or you will hate everything about him. I have been a loyal Weird Al Fan for about 12 years. ""Bought every album on cassette,then cd"". You can't deny his talent with music and his way with words. Poodle Hat can't hold a candle to past albums ""Running With Sissors, Bad Hair Day"" Don't get me wrong there are songs on this record that are great. The songs he wrote on this album are genious. The Songs that he spoofs are not the best. ""they flat out stink"". Not my personal choices to make fun of. The only thing i can tell you Al Fans. BORROW BEFORE YOU BUY. Even though this album isn't the best I am still a true blue Al Fan and I will continue to love him. :)"
2,Just not what he used to be,"I went out and purchased this new album today hoping that it would at least be better than 'Running With Scissors', but unfortunately, it's even worse (no pun intended). I think it's time for Al to either retire or come up with something new, because his music just ain't what it used to be. Either that, or else I'm simply growing too old to appreciate it anymore.I found the 'Complicated Song' to be midly amusing, but the rest of the songs on this album (as well as the last one, come to think of it) are not even worth a second listen.It might've been funny in the early 80's (and even the early 90's), but I'm sorry to say that Al shtick is really getting old."
2,disappointing,"Bought the album and saw the concert and I have to say Al's energy level seems to be waning. This album was not nearly as creative as his other work.Al seems to have risen to a new level of violence in his music, as well. Both in the lyrics and on the stage Al seems angry. Not recommended for young kids."
2,One of Al's weakest,"Sure, ""Poodle Hat"" contains the brilliant ""Hardware Store"" and ""A Complicated Song,"" but it's mostly ""Weird Al"" Yankovic's most forgettable set of tunes, from boring originals like ""Genius in France"" to yet ANOTHER parody about watching TV, ""Couch Potato.""He squanders his greatest opportunity with ""Ode to a Superhero,"" by finally parodying Billy Joel's ""Piano Man"" but wasting it with lyrics making fun of a superhero movie from a year ago! When ""Running With Scissors"" came out, ""Episode I"" had just premiered in theaters, making ""The Saga Begins"" a very funny and current song. But with ""Spider-Man"" already gathering dust on DVD shelves (not to mention HBO showing it ad nauseum), ""Ode to a Superhero"" is stale.So chalk up ""Poodle Hat"" as a big disappointment, especially since ""Scissors"" was one of Al's finest efforts."
5,'Weird Al' Strikes Again,"Wow. After 4 years of waiting, Al delivers. This is perhaps his most consistantly funny album so far. The parodies are great and most of the original works are as good or better.Out of the twelve songs, the only two I don't like are 'Wanna B Ur Luvr' and 'Genius in France'. For some reason, those song just don't reach me.Still, the other ten songs make this CD easily a must have."
1,This is the best he can do??,"Weird al just got married when this album came out and the cover was his new wife's idea. A poodle on his head? PPPLLLEEEAAASSSEEE! The album is average, but al is just not funny. All he can do is list things and put it to someone elses music. See, Bannana, Detroit, marmaset, rubber ball, toilet, I can list things too. Not funny.And the cover concept joke for al's next album Straight Outta Lynwood didn't make sense to anyone living outside of California.Pass!"
2,POODLE HAT,I ONLY BOUGHT THIS CD BECAUSE IT HAD THE EBAY SONG ON IT AND I NEEDED IT TO PUT ON MY EBAY STORE. OTHER THAN THAT I REALLY WOULD NEVER HAVE BOUGHT IT.
1,just plain dumb,If this CD is suppose to be funny well I just don't get it. The funny thing is that reviewers say you have to be smart to get the humor on this album. I beg to differ. This is nothing but ... a poor excuse for a comedy album. I will never understand the apeal for this guy. Another forgettable CD among so many. I'll stick to true comedy albums done by true comedians.
4,"Long awaited, well worth it...","I just picked Weird Al's new album this morning. On the way back to work I popped the CD into my car CD player and began listening to ""Couch Potato"", the parody of Eminem's ""Lose Yourself"". From that point on I had a smile on my face. This is a great album, fun to listen to. I may be a nerd for picking it up when the store opened this morning, but I'm proud to be associated with such a creative artist."
4,Not As Good As The Rest,"This CD was okay and I was super stoked to get it. But I feel like it's missing something. It doesn't have that good old Weird Al sound. It's starting to sound country or something. It was still great. ""A Complicated Song"" is by far the best one along with the ""Angry White Boy Polka."" That song actually made me go back and listen to those old songs again. Well, keep 'em coming Al. We love it.Peace"
5,It's growin' on me...,"...and I don't mean a poodle hat! I mean, *the* Poodle Hat... CD. Al does it again with intelligent parodies and original tunes. ""Angry White Boy Polka"" takes a little getting used to. Regardless, WAY's faithful fans will be singing it word for word, note for note. Very cool additions: Al's home movies - narrated by the Weird One himself and the voice only track of ""Hardware Store"" - slapping a song together is tougher than you think! My favorite Al CD, though, remains Running With Scissors."
3,Coulda been better,"Hey, I love Al's stuff, but I really wasn't impressed with this album. I was surprised that a Billy Joel song made the list, I know he doesn't like his stuff lampooned, but the song was about Spider-man! That was over a year ago. Would have been better if Al ran another Star Wars song in there, but none to be found. The polka stunk (sorry), but what do you expect from a bunch of Angry White Boy songs. Ugh. I liked the palindrone song, that was done well, ""A complicated song"" was good, too, but kind of lost focus. Sorry, AL, but this CD might not even do well on Kazaa."
3,Not his best,"I usually love Weird Al and his parodies. I must have anticipated this too much. Kind of feel let down. I was expecting more. Not to say that this is bad, but just not on the same level with Bad Hair Day."
4,more orginal songs took away form al's greatness,"its good, not as good as running with sisors, but its got its moments. there were less modern pop culture songs. al tried to srike lighting again with ode to a super hero but it was no saga begins. al should try to do more violent songs, cuz he is good with em. and pick up lines is a good thing for him too"
4,worth the wait,"Four years is a long time to wait for one's Al fix, but now we've got the newest. ""Hero"" is hands-down the best cut on here, for my money. I guess I'm an old fogey, a lot of the parodied stuff were songs I hadn't even heard.Rock on Al, you're a way of life."
2,too lean,"al's problem is this:many of his long time fans have NO IDEA what it is he is parodying now, thus, unless the parody is extremely well done, it doesn't make any sense to us.his problem also is, there are not that many good songs out there to parody.this effort is a hard listen, and is not his best effort.i did enjoy ""ebay"", the ""bob"" bob dylan skit, is hilarious, especially if one never could understand the appeal of dylan to start with. the zappa crappa (""genius in france"") is way too long, and like zappa, mostly crap (although, with their actions in the war againest terro, it is an apt title, and song). ""hardware store"", must be from a really rottensong. ""party at the leper colony"", is vintage weird al, as is ""why does this always happen to me?"".all in all.....not very memorable, but, as other reviewers have stated, there isn't much out there for him to work with.maybe more originals in the future?????"
1,As a Close Personal Friend of Al...,"I have to say THIS ALBUM [very bad]! I can't believe it. I have been such a fan for so many years that I never thought it would come to this. Everything I thought I knew is wrong. I just got this CD yesterday and I couldn't wait to pop it in as soon as I got in the car--I preordered it weeks ago. Like I said--I'm a big fan! I'd don't know what has happened. I did not laugh once during the whole album and most of the songs just go on too long--ya know, like a SNL sketch. I only gave it one star because I couldn't give it 0."
4,Great album with a few duds.,"At last, we have another album from Al. Fans will not be disappointed with this album, and I suspect it will appeal to a wide audience base. Don't hesitate to order it now.Some notes on the songs: COUCH POTATO - Great parody of Emimen, at least musically. The lyrics are frequently clumsy. HARDWARE STORE - More words per minute than Albuquerque, technically brilliant. TRASH DAY - Mediocre parody of Nelly's Hot In Herre. PARTY AT THE LEPER COLONY - Instant classic! Catchy tune, clever lyrics. ANGRY WHITE BOY POLKA - Standard fare. WANNA B UR LOVR - Definite dud. A COMPLICATED SONG - Excellent parody of Complicated. WHY DOES THIS ALWAYS HAPPEN TO ME? - Irony like only Al can create. ODE TO A SUPERHERO: Spiderman theme on Piano Man tune. BOB - True to form Dylan parody. EBAY - Back Street Boys meet on-line garage sale. GENIUS IN FRANCE - Musically awful, but with a message that should resonate to a lot of Americans."
2,Not weird enuff,"Wierd Al can certainly hit the funny bone. When Running W/ Scissors came out, it was one of his best efforts in years. Unfortunetely, this album's a huge disappointment. I didn't get the references in the ""Angry White Boy Polka"" except for the White Stripes. Every lyric here sounds it came from the same song, which just goes to show how truely lame radio rock is nowadays. I won't hit you with spoilers in case you get the record anyway, but the songs he spoofs simply are not that funny. The only reason it gets two stars is the ""Ebay"" song (which I'll only say gets a ribbing for a certain boy band) is a spoof that's reasonably well done. Stick with ""Scissors""."
5,Charming & great for concentration in young minds!,"My girls used to share bunks a couple of years ago and just before they fell asleep I would read the beginning chapter which is the same start to the meditation, then move on to one of the stories, each night a new meditation.Every night the girls took it in turns to choose which story they wanted for that night....it was something they definately looked forward to and I am more then sure it helped them have peaceful sleep.I highly recommend this book for young children - in fact I am sure if I got it out now, my kids would love me to read it to them still at 9 and 11 :)"
3,Not sure of the audience for the stories...,Beautifully written short visualizations but we kind of miss out on where the meditation comes into play. I have a four and ten year old and the book doesn't really apply to either age group. I was hoping for a little more guidance in teaching my children to meditate. I think this book is for kids who have the basics of meditation down and would just like another avenue for their practice.
5,great relaxation book,"great book for the kids before bed, gives them great things to dream about. This is the second book we bought, also have starbrite which is wonderful as well. (boys ages 5 & 7)"
2,"A sweet book, but not for my grandchildren","I bought this book for my daughter to read to her toddlers, but sent it back to Amazon immediately. The idea of a Guardian Angel is quickly introduced in the book and is a theme throughout. If you believe in teaching about angels to a two year old, this book is for you. It definitely wasn't for us."
5,"A useful, useable dictionary, and a good glossary","The book is structured in two parts: the poet's manual, and the rhyming dictionary. It was for the latter that I was origionally interested in the book, and very useful (and usable) it has proved to be.The first part is really a sort of brief encyclopedia (in about 130 pages) of poetry terms (resorting, at times, to descriptions of the various verse forms). For me, this turned out to be an unexpected bonus, introducing terms and forms that were new to me, giving me a point from which to delve further, elsewhere, if I wish."
5,Afro-Cuban at it's BEST!,"For those who like afro-Cuban, for those who like percussions, for those who like the spirit of groove, DON'T MISS This one. Patato is regarded as a legend, and here you can hear why."
5,best iron supplement,ive tried no less than a dozen different iron supplements for my low iron. this is by far the best one ive taken. doesnt cause stomach upset or constipation. some other pills gave me smelly burps but not this product! how wonderful! has no side effects for me at all! definitely recommend this product for everyone who needs a littke boost in their iron!
2,Gentle Iron was not the right fit,"I've tried a number of different iron supplements trying to get the right one for me. I don't have the constipation problem other people have. The green pills make me feel nauseous (CVS brand). The red pills were fine (Rugby ferrous sulfate), but I didn't feel like I was really absorbing what I was taking.I felt like this would be the answer. It turned from green to brown (oxidized) too quickly for a weekly pill container. Also when I took it, I had to go to the bathroom too frequently.It might be great for some, but I say get 90 veggie caps instead 180 if you are just going to try it."
5,Everything it says is right on mark,Good product if you're looking for an Iron supplement. The capsules are the perfect size. 180 tablets is enough to get you through 6 months.
5,big and beautiful,i've owned this and the covered vegetable for 13 years. both are beautiful and very strong. the soup tureen is much larger than the covered vegetable. It is about the size of a punch bowl but probably not as tall. i keep it on display above my cabinets. love it.
4,"Bring some balance to your business with ""World Out of Balance""","Too many businesses of every size and type get so focused on managing their day-to-day operations that they lose sight of external conditions that may have a dramatic impact on the very existence of their organization. In the book titled - ""World Out of Balance"" - author Paul A. Laudicina, provides a practical structure intended to help any organization adapt to the ongoing evolution of the global business environment while making sense of both the seismic and subtle shifts that occur. Soundview recommends this book because Laudicina identifies five trackable drivers of change that virtually anyone can keep an eye on including: globalization trends, demographics, the new consumer, natural resources and the environment, as well as regulation and activism. Bring some balance to your business with ""World Out of Balance."""
2,Good and Bad,"Wish I could give this DVD release a better then a 2-Star Review.The Characters are interesing especially the leads John Smith and RobertFuller.The stories were well written.And there is a new interview with Fuller that is well done.The Bad part is the video itself.Very grainy. Night scenes are somewhat difficult to make out.The colors are faded.The Sound is so-so.Timeless Media is a hit or miss outfit.As with The Deputy, LARAMIE misses out on a quality presention. <SAD>"
2,Larimie in Color (sort of),"FOR DIE-HARD FANS OF THIS WESTERN ONLY. Others stay away. (I want my money back). So-So color and worst scan job I have ever seen. Yes, even the 60 shows, 10 DVDs @ $9.99 sets. These prints are the quality of my over the air VHS tapes recorded at SLP of TV shows I have recorded. You can tell their source print is from tape. First set had freeze problems, which timeless did replace. ([...]) I received the replacement set and while it plays ok there is a buzz coming from my Sony DVD player that makes it sound like it is hard at work to play intro and menu. If you want a western set from these early years get Wells Fargo. It has excellent prints, well-balanced and decent stories with guest stars of the period. Timeless should have created to two labels. Wells Fargo: TMG Premier Series. Laramie: TMG Lost in the Dust Series. We could be for warned by which is great and which is trash."
1,very poor quality,"this dvd should be banned, the quality is dreadful, do not purchase this dvd you will be waisting your money."
1,Pathetic Video Quality Ruins A Pretty Good Series!,"I can only echo what several other reviewers have said...the video quality here is pathetic! It indeed does look like VHS at the SLP (6 hour) speed. Timeless Media apparently buys the legal rights to put some of these TV series out but good prints or video transfers are not always available from the source (NBC Universal in this case) so TM sometimes has to scrounge whatever prints or videos it can from collectors. They have put out some excellent quality western TV series such as ""Tales of Wells Fargo"" but this is not one of them. Think the worst of Alpha Video releases and that's what you'll get with this set. Shame on Universal for not providing some source material and shame on Timeless Media for putting this crappy set out with no word about the substandard quality on the packaging!"
2,"Laramie, The TV Series DVD Set","The listing at Amazon says not available until March 30, 2009 but it is on sale at Costco now (March 2, 2009). I purchased a set because it was my favorite Western growing up. This DVD set includes just the colorized episodes.I found the DVD's to be either poorly made or all 3 were damaged somehow because they played poorly and there were mismatched video throughout with the audio. Too bad for the stories themselves were just as good as they were when I was growing up."
2,"""Settling For Mediocre""","The sound and video detracts and distracts from the show and it's characters. On my DVD's, the sound gets out of whack with the lips, and I have to stop the DVD and restart it to get it back in sync. As with some other reviewers, the film is at times grainy, and hard to see during dark scenes. Why would they ""settle for mediocrity?"""
3,"Season Three, Not Part 1","I dont know why TMG has labeled this Laramie Part One. It is actually season three. Season 1 and 2 are in black and white so maybe they dont count them. If anyone wants to see the entire series the way it was originally aired they should purchase season one and two before they purchase ""Laramie In Color Part One"". Are there really people out there that would not watch an excellent show just because it is in black and white?"
1,This shouldn't be a textbook!,"In this book, David Wood exhibits a wealth of information, and leaves us no doubt of his research and knowledge. However, this information is arranged in an ambiguous, haphazard manner, which makes it very difficult for the reader to sift out specific material. He incorporates his own views into those of his references, and the outcome is a very confusing, un-reader-friendly text.If you are intending to purchase this book as a textbook for your studies in Psychology, I strongly urge you to reconsider. There are many other texts which provide a far clearer and more concise package of information, with much less unnecessary rambling. However, if you are looking to buy a book merely for the purpose of general knowledge or interest, without having to take an examination on the topic, then this may be a suitable book for you. Still, you will need to be really determined to read this book, otherwise you will probably be defeated by its dullness and lack of clarity."
1,Not at all good,"I was so disappointed in this cd which, among other things, features a weird salsa version of Make Believe. In my opinion, Make Believe does not lend itself very kindly to salsa. I'm not generally very critical about musicals--I love them one and all--but this well, really, is only disguised as a musical and made everyone who heard it retch in agony. It is not a good CD...unless you're excessively fond of salsa."
1,No mag.,"The only thing I've recieved, so far, is the bill.I know this is [ or was when I last subscribed ] a ten month magazine - but so far not even the usual promotional papers......."
3,Going downhill....,"My family used to receive this magazine when I was a kid growing up. Compare today's version to what was published in the early 90's and you'll notice that the magazine is about 1/3 as thick and has twice as many advertisements. Information is highly redundant (we get it, walleyes sometimes bite on 5"" swimbaits). I haven't noticed a ""Taste Tempter's"" recipe in many months. Overall the content is lacking compared to years ago, but it's still worth checking out for $1.25/issue (but just barely)."
4,In-Fisherman,The magazine subscription was quick and painless. The only thing I didn't like is that you are forced to notify them if you DON'T want it to renew automatically. You have to be pro-active or else it happens on its' own.
5,Excellent alternative to the charger that came with my camera,I lost my battery charger and was looking for a replacement to be able to charge the Canon NB-3L battery of my Elph SD550. Getting an original Canon charger was pretty expensive and I was happy to find this alternative especially that it also came with a car adaptor. I have not used the car adaptor yet but know that the wall charger works fine. It is almost as small as the original Canon charger which was a big plus for me since I liked the form factor of the charger that came with my camera. I highly recommend this charger as a replacement or simply to have an extra one available.
3,My dog likes her Vita-Tabs,"My dog Goldie likes her Vita-Tabs. She readily eats one a day given in the morning before her first meal of the day. I cannot definately say how much they are helping her health, but she seems very healthy for her 10 & 1/2 years. She does have hind leg joint problems, but those cannot be addressed by taking Vita-Tabs. Overall a good product, and we will continue giving them to her."
3,Not sure,"My 3 older (10+) dogs enjoy these vitamins, and I'm sure that they are good for them. I just don't know whether the vitamins help their joints. I'm still on the 1st bottle - with 3 dogs, it goes quickly."
1,Not pleased,Due to problems with amazon not accepting my address change this was sent to my previous address. I never recieved the item I paid for and didn't get a response when I contacted the company about redirecting the shipment even though I emailed them the same day I placed the order. Amazon's customer service was no help either.Since I only bought from this company because it was a really great deal I probably won't be trying them again.
3,Blue Law/Andy Powell-good but not great blues.,"Blue Law serves up some good horn oriented blues. Excellent musicianship by all, especially the keyboard player. Maybe he stood out to me more than the others because I am a keyboard player myself. But that said, I expected something more creative from Andy Powell. Nothing here I have not heard from a lot of other blues bands. Also nothing too creative lyrically. Still it is good to hear something in a totally different style from Wishbone Ash's Andy Powell, who is one of my favorite guitarists."
5,A timeless book to treasure,"This book was given to me in 1940 when I was seven years old. I adored it then, and I have loved it ever since. I'm so happy to see that it's back in print! The illustrations are wonderful, but the story is outstanding too, with emotional depth found in too few picture books. The child's love for the cat and kittens, and the need to make a hard choice in the way best for everyone, was something I never forgot."
4,Which kitten to keep?,"This children's book about a little girl and her kittens living in a small apartment in a big city was a 1940 Caldecott Honor book (i.e., the runner-up to the Medal winner) for best illustration in a book for children. Children love to have the story read to them of how this young child has to decide which of three kittens to keep."
1,"wonderful illustrations, but story very out of date","The drawings by the author are wonderful. However, the story's basic story line is one of disregard of a child's feelings. April is told not to be naughty by expressing her feelings. The mesage may have been appropriate during World War 2 and shortly after. However, in this day and age, a child's emotional state is known to be an important factor in the life of that child, all the way to adulthood."
4,"Ok, I'm a fan now.","I didn't even know who this guy was until he was mentioned in Brad Paisley's ""Cluster Pluck"" intro, but I figured I'd take the advice and learn something from him.Well, the teaching part of the DVD is lacking. True, he shows us some licks but doesn't necessarily ""teach"" them to us.However, there's more than an hour of interviews edited together with a great little concert that left my household full of new fans.I'm off to start collecting Redd's cds now. Thanks Brad!"
5,Redd Volkaert: Tele Twang,"I have follwed Redd's career over the years. He is an amazing guitarist, and the instructional part of this video is valuable to anyone who wants to learn more about the instrument. The performance part is highly entertaining also, Cindy Cashdollar is fantastic!!"
5,TeleTwang,An interesting DVD with some bonus 'live' tracks and interview with Redd.His teaching style is relaxed yet informative and a unique way of filming the neck makes you see on screen what you see with the guitar in your hand.Redd makes it all seem so deceptively simple and fun that you can watch it just as entertainment.Bravo Redd !!
5,Great reading,I cannot wait to see this as a full length movie.:-)This is a story that will play very well as a movie.It seems that there is no end to the great stories we can put into drama.Great for the whole family as far as I am concerned.
2,This Isn't Andrew,"I was severely disappointed in firescape. I guess I was hoping for a much more SoCo Jack's Mannequin style of music. I know Andrew had nothing to do with this project, but I figured it would still be reminiscent of his music....not so. I wasn't a huge fan of the vocals, but the guitar is very good. Overall though, I was very unimpressed."
2,Not sure what the author was trying to depict.,"When Sunny Batten received the phone call that her mother and her mother's fiancee, Miles Finn, were found dead of carbon monoxide poisoning due to a faulty furnace, Sunny returns to King George, the small town where she grew up. At the funeral, she meets Mile's son, who takes one look at her and claims that they have to be related because they have the same fine, fly-away hair with gray flecks in it. That just about sums up the book. From there, it's like the author didn't know in which direction to take them, so they just kind of drifted along day to day accepting this new knowledge and trying to figure out where to go from there. It was a very low-key, nondescript story with no particular aim to it."
2,not the great elinor lipman i know,"I agree totally with the review of my fellow new yorker below. I love Elinor Lipman, but even the one other book of hers I didnt care for was better than this. It's as though she got another good idea, but wasnt really paying attention when writing the story. There are too many bit players in too many subplots that go nowhere. The main character is almost a complete blank. All we really know about her is she plays golf and seemed to have a rough time socially in high school. The main plot is also neglected. About halfway through I was asking myself, where is this going? What's the point? The usual snappy dialogue and feisty characters seemed to be watered down also. This is NOT typical Lipman. I found five of her other books to be excellent. If this is the first one you read, try one of the others. Even if you think this book is good, youll see how much better she can be. I'll try for better luck with her next one."
2,I love Elinor Lipman but...,"I looked forward to the release of this book so eagerly because I have loved- LOVED- everything else of Lipman's I have read... Ladies' Man, Inn at Lake Devine, Isabel's Bed, etc.But I was so disappointed by this one that I left it on the airplane rather than drag it back home.While it is Lipman's usual collection of eccentric characters with interwoven lives, I felt like nothing HAPPENED in this one. What did Sunny want? What was she after? She was a protagonist without a rudder. And the big revelation at the end is that her mother was slutty? So what? In the end it affected no one at all, apparently.If you have never read Lipman I definitely would start with some of her others. In my opinion, she is usually a much better writer."
3,Light and Fluffy,"Lipman's newest novel is so light and fluffy the words may float off the pages. This is not necessarily a bad thing, especially with a novelist like Lipman, who knows how to create appealing, identifiable characters. The novel's theme is not as heavy as her last book, ""The Inn at Lake Devine"", which dealt with anti-semitism. Even though the center of this story concerns the death of two people, the tone is kept humorous and the protagonist, Sunny's grief is handled with the same light touch as the rest of the novel.It's all rather pat, from Sunny's relationship with her newly discovered smart-aleck brother to her relationship with an old schoolmate, now the Andy Taylorish chief of police. But we like the characters and we like this book, which is a perfect summer read."
5,Great product!,"This is a valuable tool for getting perspective on the timeline of the Bible, right down to the chapter of each book. Great for any Bible study group or individual study. Do some searching online to find it a lot cheaper, though."
3,entertaining movie the is fun to watch,"To enjoy this movie, you cannot take it seriously. Just enjoy the music, forget about the plot. I think of it as a cult type of movie. It has 40's type of music in it."
5,Great addition to Summer Breeze collection,I recently ordered this stoneware sugar and creamer set to supplement my Pfaltzgraff Summer Breeze collection. They complement each other and the rest of the set beautifully. The creamer is so large that I have used it when I have company to pour maple syrup or gravy.
4,fun,"Purchased as a gag gift for a business owner who is slowing down. Just point the pen instead of getting up to show employees what you want done. comes boxed with batteries. far nicer than the pointer I recieved from importer520 with no box or batteries , just a pen in a mailer envelope. Anyhow it has been great fun and the cat also seems to enjoy chasing it."
5,Awesome,"Amazing for its price.Shipping was fantastic -- My est. delivery time was Dec. 9 - Dec. 14, but it came Dec. 6!The batteries it comes with suck, though. When you get it, I definitely recommend replacing one or both batteries with a better one, like Duracell. The brightness and distance of the laser noticeably increases with good batteries. (AAA batteries, by the way.)Good product."
3,Average for the price,"The light output is as expected. Power button sometimes doesn't seem to line up with the switch inside the unit. The part of the pen where the laser unit housing meets the battery pack keeps popping off. I tried a little super glue but it doesn't seem to want to stay together. Not a big problem but if you are looking for quality, this is NOT it. Great for a pet toy, not reliable enough for a business presentation though. I guess you get what you pay for."
1,Piece of junk,"It doesn't seem like there's a lot that could go wrong with a one-button laser pointer, but this product finds a way to uncover a bunch:- Button is a tiny knob that requires a lot of pressure to depress; it quickly becomes uncomfortable to use- Laser is intermittent; it cuts out a lot; you have to shake the pointer or play with it to make it work again- Clip is too stiff; it isn't really usable- Despite very limited usage, the batteries wore out quicklyI'm not sure how many other ways you could measure the success of such a simple product. From just about every aspect, though, I'd call this a failure."
1,Red laser pointer bad product,"I ordered this red laser pointer in Oct. 2011 to use in exercising my cat. I have used it no more than twice a week for a few minutes at a time. Now it doesn't work at all. I've changed batteries and even taken it apart, to no avail. This pointer is a piece of junk."
3,buy a green laser instead,First thing I noticed is it's not made perfect. I like how it came with batteries. The outside of the laser pointer looks nice and it feels sturdy but the red laser is not as powerful as a nice green laser that I had bought with good reviews. I will update this review if anything I feel should be added.
3,"Nice, but not aligned properly.","All I can say here is that it is a nice laser pointer, <5mW, 645nm, somewhat more orange than a 650nm laser. Feels nice, a little heavy, but a cool gold finish. Button is a bit flimsy. The only real complaint is that the lens was screwed on at an angle, so the beam leaves at about a 10 degree angle. But its cool, and looks really nice. You wouldnt really notice if you were using this for a presentation or anything. lol"
3,did not come with batteries,description says it comes with batteries. mine did not.will put the batteries in and find out how it functions
5,Love it,"This is pretty awesome! Always wanted to use one of these. It came in a really awesome box. Buy it with confidence, you wont regret it! I know i didn't"
3,Not bad for so cheap but not sold as advertised,"Product came quickly, but without batteries and the spring inside was bent so I had to fix it before I could use it to play with my dog. For the price though I guess thats what you get. For anyone using this to play with a Pet I went to Petco the other day and they had lasers pointers for pets for around $2-3 as well, so you could save yourself cost of shipping."
2,Mine was defective,I didn't expect high quality for this price but I expected the product to work. Mine will not remain screwed together. It was loose from the installation of the batteries. I contacted the vendor and they agreed to replace my unit. I will update the review if the new unit has the same problem.
1,"Scanning the reviews, it is hit or miss. Mine missed.","The pointer I received only intermittently would work when the switch was pressed right out of the box. Then it wouldn't work at all. Tried new batteries without success. The batteries it came with are heavy duty and I put in alkaline batteries. Then I stretched the spring inside to see if the batteries weren't making contact. It started working intermittently again. A short while later, I noticed that the pointer had become very hot (mine didn't smoke like another reviewer's experience but may have if I did not remove the batteries) even though the switch was not pressed and the pointer light was not on. Returned."
1,Awful product,"Really bad; it is cheap so I guess the quality is for its money; instead of one spotlight for pointing out in a presentation, you'll get 5 or 6, almost same size, so actually you cannot use it for anything."
1,marginal,I bought this laser pointer to use when teaching. It worked for less than a year. The switch seems to have gone bad. The problem is not the batteries. I would not recommend this product.
4,Good quality and strong - hard to hold button down for long,"Title says it all.We use as a cat toy. It hurts your finger to hold down the on button very long. We resolved using a strong / rubberband wrapped around the button when we are going to ""play"" for long periods at a time."
2,Reason for cheapness,"I've used this laser pointer twice so far for presentations. On the first try, the laser already started showing a weak beam unless I pressed the button quite firmly. By its second use I had to mash the button down to get any signal at all. There's a reason this pointer is so cheap..."
2,"Batteries pop out, end cap doesn't screw in, wont stay attached","I bought this laser pointer as a cat toy, and left a review after owning it for a week or so. Since then, I have ran across a few inconveniences with it. The cap that holds the batteries in will not stay on, it does not screw in but instead pushes in. You cannot have the top part screwed all the way in, when you do, it pushes the batteries right out of the end of it. It has become quite annoying. Buyer beware, remember that you get what you pay for...."
5,Wonderful device!,"I replaced a pointer that used button cell batteries for one using AAA's. This is amazingly bright, and has a long battery life. The price can't be beat, especially considering it comes with a nice case which can hold 2 additional AAA batteries."
3,"You have to keep holding down the button, and the case is fragile","The form factor and the weighting are fine, so it's easy to direct the beam. The price is low ($8.70 as of this writing). But the beam doesn't stay on unless you press the button constantly--there's no on/off switch.This makes it, literally, a real pain to use for any length of time. I bought mine mostly for use as a cat toy, so having to hold down a button is a deal-breaker.Also, the carrying case has a ""hinge"" which is really just a thin membrane of material. Mine has already started breaking after three or four times opening the box. After a couple more uses, I expect it will break away, separating the lid from the box proper. I bet that's the reason the manufacturers included a cardboard sleeve for the box--they knew the hinge wouldn't hold.If I were you, I'd pay a few more bucks and get something better. In fact, I'm going to do just that, once I return this product."
2,supreme cat toy--unreliable switch,"This is my second purchase of this laser pointer, the first having fallen into the hands of a friend who uses it to entertain her cats. There probably isn't much to say here that hasn't been said already; cats love to chase the dot, and having one of these in the house will do much to enrich their life, especially if they're indoor-only.EDIT: 10 months of use has revealed the weakest link in the device: the switch. Another cheap device goes into the e-waste bin."
2,The Yugo of laser pointers...,"Most items this simple to operate don't really need user instructions. If I were to write them for this laser pointer, here is what I would write:1. Push the button2. Push the button again3. Cuss a little bit4. Shake laser pointer5. Push button again6. Use laser pointer for 30 seconds to 2 minutes7. Repeat as needed for 4-5 weeks until laser pointer dies"
3,Has a short,"I bought this for my cats. It has a super bright laser and my cats love it. The only problem is that it has a short somewhere in the on/off button. I have to hold it just so, and twist the cap just right in order to get it to work. Sometime it shuts off anyway, to the frustration of my cats. I can only hold it for short periods of time because my hand starts to cramp. Other than that it's fine. Maybe I just got a bad one. It is too cheap to send back."
1,didn't work at all; straight from the box.,Didn't work straight out of the box. Even with changing batteries. It is a waste of money.Don't plan to return because I really don't have time to deal with it. Will drive to an office supply store to buy something else.
3,Exactly what I wanted,"This pointer is exactly what I wanted. That's not to say it is phenomenal, but I didn't look for a phenomenal pointer. Still works after long use. Haven't had any issues with it. Most of the weight comes from the batteries, but it's sturdy enough. I have not dropped it, so I cannot tell you what would happen then. If you want a tool to use for a while that you don't think you'll need two or three years down the road--go ahead and get this. It works. It works well. Red light, not green. One button. Pen clip. Aluminum carrying case if you really need to carry it like that. No changeable heads, just a straight-up pointer."
3,its cool,"its cool for the price. Only goes about a mile. Great for messing with dogs, cats, ect. Pretty strong for only a 5 MW."
4,Great product.,"Great product. Only downside is that when the batteries get a little low, the red dot starts to dull."
4,Red Laser Pointer,Item arrived sooner than expected! The item description is accurate. Pointers are of average quality and great for occasional use.
3,Flimsy,"I guess you get what you pay for. This thing is extremely flimsy, and the batteries don't always make a good connection. It's fine when it does, though. Keeps the animals entertained well!"
5,Can't beat the value...,"$5 total from HDE. I got this laser pointer with in a day at standard shipping. It is sturdy. To get the most out of it, you have to press really hard. If you bend the clip, it may come out. You cannot re-insert it if it comes out. The gold-colored metal accumulates scratches pretty easy. The batteries last a very long time. Outside this pointer has no trouble reaching anything you want it to. I'd recommend it."
2,Shoddy at Best,This thing isn't very good quality. Most of the black paint is flaking off. I've had to put aluminum foil in the battery chamber to maintain a good connection. It comes apart very easily. I don't know how long it's going to last at this rate!
5,Does everything it needs to,"I needed to buy a laser pointer that I could take apart and use the laser in an experimental setup. If you are looking to do this, this laser pointer is perfect for it. It's easy to take apart and the laser works well even after being disassembled."
4,For the Cat,We got this for playing with our cat. It would be better if I didn't have to hold the button to keep the light on. The cat loves it.
3,Double Dot,"This is a bright red laser, but the dot is not well defined. Mine has two dots that diverge with distance. Overall the construction quality is not exactly first class. You get what you pay for."
2,Great for a while.,"My cat and I loved this for a while but after about a year it stopped working - unless I shake and bang it, then it works for thirty seconds or so. The price was good but I would probably purchase a higher quality laser next time."
4,Great Product!,"I was looking for a cheap pointer and decided on this. No problems w/ shipping, came WITH BATTERIES, VERY strong at night, nice job guys!"
1,Cheap junk,Very poor quality. The threads that hold the laser mechanism to the battery tube are soft cheap metal and do not hold the thing together.
4,You get what you pay for!,"For this much money, you get what you pay for. It actually is a quite nice laser pointer, although the only reason I bought it was for my cat. It does get very uncomfortable to keep holding the button to keep the laser on. Also, it is quite heavy when you hold it. However, it works for what I need to use it for and the battery life is actually quite long. Pleasantly surprised with this purchase."
5,Great laser.,"This is a nice product. It shoots 5mw in a very clear dot. Nicely made, got it for free so that is a big plus. You can get stuff off of amazon for free too. Just sign up at http://www.-free-xbox-games.tk"
1,Boring Communist Sheep Music,"Puh-lease...stop your whining and get a job, Mr. Heaton. You must be a communist because your music saps me of all hope and joy in life. I, for one, will not be lulled into submission to the totalitarian government you idealize by your shimmering pop melodies."
4,BETTER THE MORE I HEAR IT!1,"SOME SAY REMINISCENT OF MORRISEY, YES BUT ALSO IMAGINE PAUL WELLER AND THE ""JAM"" WITH POP RIFS, MOTOWN INFLUENCE, AND HARD BASS DRIVEN BACKS. IT'S GREAT AND A FIT, LISTEN AGAIN AND AGAIN! DON'T EVER FORGET THE INFLUENCE OF ""KINKS"" ENGLAND STREET LIFE LYRICS LIKE ""BRICK TO BRICK, WE BUILD."""
5,Wonderful replacement,I bought this replacement faucet sprayer after reading the many reviews on it. I was not disappointed. It installed in minutes and is working just perfectly saving me from having to replace the entire faucet.
4,"Not a good dish washer, sprays more like a shower head.","A bit smaller than my original but it screws on and fits. The functions seem cheap but at least it doesn't leak, not yet. My old one had half as many holes for the sprayer and were much smaller, which was great for high pressure washing which this does not do. The holes are bigger and squared which requires good water pressure to fucntion as a dish washer. I wish there were more to choose from, it was this or something else twice the price."
1,Attachment isn't standard,"I had this shipped directly to a rental in a remote location. The renter dismantled the broken sprayer only to discover the new unit would not screw onto the existing hose. Despite going to the only two local hardware stores and my willingness to pay an additional $40 for an adapter to make this work, he could not get it attached. So he bought another sprayer and we returned this one. He said the design looked pretty good, like it wouldn't break, but it wasn't metal as we had hoped and most importantly, he couldn't get it to work."
2,Listen to this...,"I bought one of these at Walmart for $125 which is waaaaaaaaay cheaper than the $200 - $250 price tags you see everywhere else. It didn't come close to measuring up to some of the reviews I had read. Even at low volumes it doesn't handle bass very well. When higher volumes are attempted the speaker struggles to maintain any type of clarity. There's also no battery operation which limits any kind of portability. Overall this speaker did not come close to providing a quality sound source for my music. Ironically, the Micro version, which is a smaller sister model, performed better in terms of putting out a cleaner sound. But it doesn't have the power to entertain. All that being said, for the same price there are a few superior pieces of equipment out there and the Altec IM7 stands at the top."
4,AMAZING SOUND,"I've had this guy for over a year now. When I first received it, I noticed one of the speakers wasn't working. My girlfriend then accidentally dropped it between the dresser and the wall, and that speaker has worked ever since. Go figure! That's the only reason I'm giving this unit 4 stars instead of 5.On a related note that will only affect some of you, since updating my iPhone to the new 2.2.1 version, this is no longer recognized as a dock. When I plug my phone into it, it starts to charge, but the sound will NOT transmit through the dock. The music plays out of the iPhone's internal speaker for some reason. Luckily, you can hook an 1/8"" to 1/8"" cable into the back of this thing and it works just fine. It looks ugly, but it works. Not sure about any reduction in sound quality; I've only tested it to make sure I could do it.So if you have an iPhone 3G, make sure you buy a cable as well! I doubt this issue is specific with this dock, so that could be true no matter which way you go ;}"
4,"Little speaker, big sound","This is a super speaker for the size. I listen to mostly classical music, and I wanted something with a big sound. The bass and mid ranges don't disappoint, though the treble is a tad tinny. Definitely a good buy. Its good looks are a bonus."
4,Better than advertised,"This JBL High-Performance iPod Loudspeaker is very nice. Strong, rich and clear sounds come out of this relatively small unit. The design is also very nice to look at while listening to my ipod or streaming music from my PC. I use it everyday to get my music fix. A good buy."
5,Thousand dollar sound for a small fraction of the cost,"I was shocked when I heard it. It fills my large family room with full-throated sound: clear highs and rumbling bass. Piano music sounds like some one is sitting at my piano, pipe organ shakes the walls! It puts my Logitech Pure Fi to shame. The remote is confusing, but the wonderful sound makes it a great bargain anyway. I bought another for work."
5,Best price and great quality,"We do not have a stereo system and wanted something that could fill up our living and dining room with music. We looked at other systems and they were either too big, too expensive or did not put out a lot of sound. This system is perfect all around - size, price and sound level. It is great that my wife and I can take either of our ipods and plug them in to play music. We put the system in our dining room and I use the remote in the living room to changes songs, control volume and to start/stop play. We do not use them, but there are many ways to connect audio and video players to the system (it is not just for ipods)."
5,Terrific Sound!,"This JBL has impressed me by its powerfull sound and easy controls, besides the beautiful design that fits perfectly in my room."
5,JBL Radial Micro Rocks!!!,"I bought the JBL Radial Micro - White for my daughter as a 10th birday present. The price is right at $129.99. She loves it! I am surprised by the warm/nice sound for such a small unit. I gave my wife the JBL Radial (full size) last year for her birthday and she (we) love it. The Micro will fit nicely in my daughter's room. Tried to get a black JBL Radial Micro for my son's 12th birthday, but can figure out why the white is $129.99 on Amazon but the black one is $284??? Seems odd. So we had to pick up the black one for my son at Target for $149.99 :o( Something seems quite fishy with the black radial micro listed on Amazon???"
4,Very Good For The Size,"I bought the JBL Radial through Amazon and it was not working properly - had issues with the remote. However, Amazon quickly exchanged it and sent a new one before I even returned the original one. The new one works perfectly and I have had no issues with it. It has amazing sound for a such a small speaker system. It is a bit 'odd' looking but does not take up much space at all. Only two small things that I would like to change is to be able to adjust the bass a bit. Also, the sound loudness intervals could be a bit more sensitive. The change between not loud enough and too loud could be modified. BUT, for the size and price, overall it is VERY good. I have heard the Bose and it measures up very nicely to that system for less money."
2,"Pretty, but not high-performance sound","I bought this unit after reading good reviews here . I was very disappointed. After reading that the JBL compairs to the Bose unit i thought i can't go wrong , especially since this is the best looking (in my taste at least) out there. The sound quality is far from high-performance. Plus, for this price, a built in alarm clock could have been expected tooI just bought the Altec Lansing IMV712 unit, which is simply the best sound i've ever heard from any of those so many Ipod speaker systems. This JBL went straight to my kids."
4,coloring and designing fun,This is cool.Barbie is a fashion designer and her models pose her designs on a runway.This will make you feel a little like a designer too as you choose the colours of Barbies fashion designs.It also includes pink tracing paper so kids can draw the designs themselves.Fun.
5,flexible whisk,hunted all over town for a flexible whisk. all the new ones are very rigid. this one I use for getting smooth gravy....no lumps!
3,Not quite what I was hoping for.,"From the image you can tell that the handle is stainless steel. Unfortunately, it is only the handle and not the spring whisk part. That is still chrome plated whatever metal which will eventually start to flake off. It does work the way a spring whisk should though. My favorite kind when I am making gravies or sauces."
3,A Bit Disappointing,"I remember these spring whisks from long ago, and was expecting an upgrade of those. It is well made, but the spring part is smaller in all dimensions and not as strong as my good old ones. It looks like it won't scratch anything, which is good. Time and use will tell if it is effective."
4,Like this wisk,I really like this wisk. It's good for mixing pancake batter as well as sour cream mixtures. I would like to see a larger one for mixing heavier batters.
2,Deception,"NOT made in Switzerland, as one would imagine. The name and the tag, give the impression of being manufactured in Switzerland, but Not So.made in China, the Whisk was returned to Amazon. Should be labeled, if I wanted to buy from China, I would have. I could go to a dollar store for Chinese made kitchen tools! Amazon should describe the products honestly."
5,"great ""must have"" whisk",I saw this whisk being used on a television show (probably Food Network). I couldn't find one in a store anywhere so I purchased one from Amazon. Wish I would have bought one years ago. It is a great little whisk and is ideal for whisking in a pot. The design gets into the corner of the pot where the side of the pot meets the bottom and also thoroughly scrapes the bottom of the pot as well. I would highly recommend everyone have one of these whisks for their kitchen.
3,Custom Fit,"These could have ""Custom Fit"" my 2000 Silverado a bit better than they did but with some minor scribe-and-trim they look good."
3,sandwichs is only good song,this cd is ok but like i said sandwichs is the only good song.but good for partys.
5,This monitor is phenomenal!,"This is one of the best looking displays I have ever seen. It is crisp and clear, and of course, has a larger viewable area than a traditional CRT monitor. It makes my old monitor look like a dinosaur! It is slim and attractive, with a tilting display, and provides me with at least 8"" more desk space than I had previously. 5 stars also to Viewsonic tech support. Although you cannot search their site for common issues, the wait for a technician was less than 5 minutes, and he quickly solved my problem of ""waves"" across the screen, which occurred after installing the drivers, by having me change the refresh rate from Optimal to 60 mhz. Viewsonic makes an excellent product, and this does not just apply to their CRT monitors. If you are looking for an LCD monitor, you can stop looking right here."
3,"Good, but not their best","The Inspiral's were right at the centre of the 'baggy' indie scene of the early 90's. They even headlined the Reading Festival one year, and yet...where are they now?Barely remembered, but yet they were a band with genuine musical talent, and a great live act.This was their weakest album, but still a good effort. Where it went wrong was to stray from their proven formula of cheesy keyboards and depressing lyrics about northern bus stops.Worth a listen though.By the way...- they really are named after a type of carpet - they were widely accepted as the ugliest band in Britain"
4,"Never, ever buy generic Brother toner cartridges","I've tried various sources for generic Brother TN-250 cartridges, and they are all crap. That includes Staples and Office Depot as well some other ""no names"". I replaced two drum units, thinking the drum units were shot, when the only problem was generic and off-brand toner cartridges.I have two identical Brother DCP printers, so I can swap drum units and cartridges between machines and play mix-and-match. And everything works fine as long as the unit has a Brother cartridge. Anything else and print quality goes to crap. Pages come out light. They have streaks. Sometimes the entire page turns gray.If you have been using generics and switch back to a good cartridge, be aware that it will take close to a ream of paper before you finally clear all of the old crappy toner."
5,The only logical solution,"This is the genuine product and functions properly without a worry. Costs a little more, but lasts longer."
1,Serious printing problem with the toner cartridge,Everytime I printed out papers using the new toner cartridge there are always black bands crossing the paper. Sometimes the whole paper is black and I can't see anything. No similiar problem with my printer when I used it before. And I tried to fix the problem with every possible methods but still did not work. I believe there must be something wrong with the toner.
5,Don't be burned,"We've had an MFC4800 for a number of years now (and paid several hundred more than it sells for now.)I bought a non-Brother toner cartridge. Once.It printed terribly, had streaks everywhere. I wound up replacing the drum as well to get it working properly again.This was only the 2nd toner cartridge, so I don't think it was quite time for a drum.Spend the extra money on this - buy the Brother toner."
1,"It's a refill, stay away from it","This is basically a misrepresentation. It gives you the impression that you are buying a Brother TN250. But you are not.My old toner was original from Brother and it's just running out and didn't give me problem at all. However, after using this toner, the first couple pages were ok. But the following ones were almost all black. I took it out and put back in my old toner, all the printouts are now black (actually it's gray coz low in toner). Looks like the drum was ruined by this refill toner! I'd read about people's advice of avoiding this kind of toner and didn't quite believe it. Now I regret..."
1,Had to Return,This was the wrong item so I had to return it! I did not like dealing with their phone service.
4,databazaar,"I ordered a toner cartridge. delivered on time, compatible with my computer, fair product with a great price."
3,nothing spectacular,"There's nothing special with this stuff, according to the pic there are multiple of items but you only get the third bottle, from left to right. It's slippery no doubt but it only last but so long, an average of 5mns, and it gets everywhere but it doesn't stain or smell so that's a plus. Other than that I can't see much more of a help this can be."
3,"Nice, but there is better","This certainly does the job, but there are much better lubes out there that work a bit smoother. This product also has trouble sliding off easily if a gob of it is put in one spot. Certainly makes a mess if that happens since it seems like it should stay there in that state (I know, it's lube). Also will dry so might need to use more if in for a marathon. Will certainly use it all up, but will buy another product when I need more."
1,Sticky Stick STICK,This is the worst lube ever! It is sooo very sticky - it starts out fine but within 1 minute it is so very sticky.We had to wash it off and start with our other lube. DO NOT BUY this. It is worse then no lube because it gets soooo sticky.
2,Review,I did not care for this product at all. It was somewhat watery and did not serve it's lubrication purpose at all.
2,"perhaps other people like it, but it's not for me","Pros: No sticky or thick residue. Dries as though nothing was on the skin.Cons: Dries very quickly. Very liquidy, almost like watery syrup.Context: I'm a guy using this product solo."
1,Disappointed... quick drying,"Ultimately, I am very disappointed with this product and will not re-purchase. I was excited to find it at such a great price considering I've seen it sold in reputable adult stores. I was anxious to give it a try. The innitital feel is great - thick yet very slippery. But of all personal lubes I've ever tried, this one dries by far the fastest...and with a bit of a sticky feel. I use it for anal lubrication and need to re-apply frequenly. Vaginal may be a different story."
1,Terrible product..did nothing for me,I used this product for the first time and was very disappointed. The slipperiness dispersed very quickly and did not get the job done. I want a refund on my purchase. WILL NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT EVER!!
5,Slippery for sure,Girlfriend and i think this is amazing. Feels great and doesnt make a mess. Would suggest to anyone and everyone that i know.
1,Intimidating,"This was recommended to be used with the Vacurect Vacuum (which was too intimidating to use) so this products sits on the shelf, too."
2,Meh,"When i first used this it wasn't bad, infact it was pretty good. but it got dry in like 3 min, had to keep reapplying every 3-5 min, and i used a decent amount. im a guy and this product is nothing compared to ID glide for example. even tho u get about 3 Oz more of this stuff for the same price. Slippery Stuff is easier to clean tho, mostly cuz it like evaporates so fast. if ur a guy dont get this lol."
3,it lubes alright...,"well it lubes. That's a plus and it doesn't give yeast infections because it's sugar and glycol free. however applying this is a pain! it's not as gel like as it says it is. it runs all over the place, making more of a mess than you will! My search for good water based lube continues."
3,Pfaltzgraff catalog has this set for $30.00,"I bought this set for about $60.00 here for my sister's birthday and 2 days after my purchase I received a Pfaltzgraff catalog that had them for $30.00, I paid double for them here so I don't feel like I got such a great deal. This is not the first time this has happened to me at Amazon. I was addicted to Amazon, I thought free shipping was nice for holidays and birthdays because I have family that lives out of state, I am no longer addicted to Amazon and after paying double for these I don't even plan on ever shopping here again. My sister seems to like them, they match the set of dishes I bought for her here at Christmas."
4,Not an Easy Mount,"Very difficult to mount these pedals, the manufacturer expects all the pedals to look like the one in the flimsy one page instructions. They look really nice tho, painted them black and then clear coated them several times. Take some getting used to as the lengths are a bit longer and wider for the flame pattern than the stock pedals."
3,Hawkwind - 'Decide Your Future' EP (Griffin),"Four track/24 minute EP that the only two cuts that I could ever get ANY enjoyment out of are the two mixes of the song ""Right To Decide"",that had originally appeared on the band's 1992 effort 'Electric Teepee'.There's the CD version and a radio edit.I've seen a video where the band performed live and this tune KILLS when played during a concert.For die-hard fans ONLY."
3,Some Strong Moments,"Much like HoJo's other works (with the exception of ""Dream Into Action""), ""Cross That Line"" is an album with a handful of great songs, and others that fall flat. The album starts off incredibly strong with ""The Prisoner"" and ""Everlasting Love"". Two of HoJo's best songs, but radically different. ""Last Supper"" is a tragic song that keeps you on the edge of tears (well... if you've been in that kind of a situation I guess). And ""Fresh Air Waltz"" is a positive track which has an infectious melody. ""Those Who Move Clouds"" is a decent closer, but the rest of the album I tend to skip."
3,Has A Few Moments,"This is an album from Howard Jones that I can't say I much get into. It's obvious it's quite different than his past offerings. Overall though, most of this album is just too mellow and uninteresting. The production and the musicianship are good, but the songs just aren't very captivating. Exceptions are ""Prisoner"" and ""Out of Thin Air."" ""Powerhouse"" is also pretty upbeat and fun to listen to. Cross that Line is my least favorite album from Howard Jones, but it isn't completely bad though."
2,"'Dream Into Action', it's not.","If you liked that articular album, 'Cross The Line' is going to leave you quite flat. The Prisoner and Everlasting Love are certainly decent enough. But the rest of the album leaves me wondering what the hell happened. The fun-loving energy of 'Dream Into Action' just seems to be missing on this album, only to be replaced by WAY too many slow and boring songs that seem more appropriate on an elevator music station. Of course, some people might like this. But it is not my cup of tea."
3,Purchased For One Song,"This album was nothing spectacular. It has some good songs on it, but I really bought it for Last Supper. I love that song and this was the only album I could find with it."
3,everlasting love,"Everlasting love is the best song on the whole tape. Normally I don't really care for this type of music, but this one is an exception. Maybe because it came from the 80's?????"
3,Bought Toy for 7 year old,"We bought this toy for our 7 year old for Christmas. He is really careful with his trucks. If this was bought for a child that was rough on toys I would not recommend it, it would break easily. The crane is a little difficult to use and the strings get tangled up easily."
3,Kenworth Crane,Bought it for a 9 yr old. It is cheaply made not for the very young. It can easily be broken.
1,Very poorly made.,"Very poor construction and quality. Very flimsy; barely took out of box a few minutes to find no functionality at all in the crane. Not durable, not fun, nor educational. Poor design, should not be sold on Amazon. Deters me from ordering similar toys.I have promptly returned the item, and am awaiting my refund confirmation."
2,Not a Kenworth,If I were Kenworth I would make them take my name off this toy. I agree the truck is ok but please be advised you need a very long thin screwdriver to get the toy out of the box. The crane is inexpensively made and the string was tangled so bad out of the box that the only way we could get it to work was to cut it and restring it ourselves. Our boys really were excited and it was a shame to see them so let down by this toy.
5,Vocal dialogue immediately improved,"I have auditioned center channel speakers costing hundreds more, and this is by far the best sounding, best value unit available.- The frequency response is very smooth.- All voices, from the deepest pretentious radio announcer to the squeakiest airhead valley girl, are immediately intelligible- Very wide sweet-spot. Excellent horizontal and vertical dispersion mean you can safely place it above or below your main screen.- Extremely solid and well built.- Testosterone-manly without the front cover, and nicely understated with it on. Your wife will love it.- JBL is made in the USA!Buy it."
3,Lack of Support by JBL,"I have a JBL LC2 which has the same 6"" base speakers as the L820. Both the base speakers in my LC2 have torn rubber surrounds, and since this is a sealed unit, having a hole where air can escape past the rubber surrounds does not fill me with confidence that I am hearing this speaker as it was designed. These rubber surrounds appear to be a unique design and those freely available for sale elsewhere do not fit, it appears to be a poor design whereby the thinnest part of the rubber has a sharp edge under it that makes it very easy to tear. I have approached JBL in Australia, USA, and UK, and none of them have replacement rubber surrounds, even those these speakers are still available for sale. Not only do they not have the rubber surround, but they do not even have replacement 6"" drivers. I would strongly recommend that you look very closely at the crease of the rubber surround of the 6"" woofer driver in these speakers before buying the speaker, and that would go for the L820."
4,Huge center channel speaker - beware shipping,"This is a great center channel speaker. I replaced an older smaller JBL. This one has deeper, clearer voice reproduction. Highly recommended. Beware Amazon shipping however, which is why I give it only four stars. UPS driver dropped it off on my porch and took off before I could get outside. The package had a large gaping hole in it which he had placed on the porch so the hole was facing the wall. Luckily the hole faced the back side of the speaker and it seems to sound OK, but if the damage had been on the front side the cones could have been trashed. There is only protective styrofoam on the sides of the speakers inside the box."
5,wlangan,"The Four Tops were too talented to only produce one great song every few months and yet that is all that could be expected to be played and made to be a hit on sixties radio. So having all these songs by such a talented group is priceless. I have always especially loved the song ""Bernadette"" and ""If I Were a Carpenter"" along with ""Reach Out"" and other more obvious hits. I really don't think any popular music was fuller or richer or more appealing throughout the sixties. When Levi passed away I was a little disappointed there was not more attention focused on his influence on American music. This band knew how to create a deeply emotional and spiritually uplifting sound and they were able to reach deep down into onto the heart and soul of the child I was when these songs were first released. I really miss this style of music for that reason and so I especially enjoy an anthology that is filled with not only the hits but just song after song performed by the masters of soul."
4,excellent dancing & singing music in classic motown style,excellent dancing & singing music in classic motown style
1,dull,"Do not waste your money. Lacks much of a story line, characters very variably defined and dialogue seldom amusing. having said thhis, it is better than some of the others in this series."
1,Junk!,"Those looking for useable tools should look elsewhere. These hammers are junk. Horrible fit and finish, horrible paint, horrible craftmanship.The handles look like they were made with junk wood and 1 of the hammer head is loose, and another one came right off when I took the hammer out of the package."
1,I don't like this cd,"The songs of this CD I sound already to something listened to, do notlike anything. Bustamante does not contribute anything new to themusica and it sees clearly that it copies to many of other singers. Ifeel it but I do not recommend it to anybody."
1,the cd is very bad,"I don't like this cd, it's very simple. The Bustamante's voice is of machine, it isn't real. This singer is copy of other, he isn't original singer. The songs are very bad, The songs of this CD I sound already to something listened to, do notlike anything. Bustamante does not contribute anything new to themusic and it sees clearly that it copies to many of other singers. Ifeel it but I do not recommend it to anybody."
5,"Enhorabuena, David!","I spent 6 months in Spain recently and got hooked on Operacion Triunfo. My favorites from the show are the two Davids: Bisbal and Bustamante from the first edition.I truly enjoyed their first albums. Everything about them was great: fun, energetic, passionate. Great vocals.Unfortunately, Bisbal's second album is a great disappointment.But Busta's 2nd album is a true ""Triunfo"". Busta has grown tremendously as an artist and vocalist (though at times his high notes can get a little tedious). But this 2nd album is satisfyingly different from his first album. His vocal arrangements are superb - although his voice may lack the richness of Bisbal's, he demonstrates much greater versatility. And I have to say that I can't think of one bad track on the entire CD."
2,Too slow,"When you get stuck and think you've done everything you need to do, there is no help button to get a clue and keep going. I got about 3/4 through it and gave up because it was too time consuming to keep trying the same old things over and over.I loved the game, but when you get stuck, you stay stuck."
2,Mostly Nothing,"I don't know if the cd was defective or not but I've never had a game that crashed as much as this one. The story line wasn't that good either. Maybe because I was so frustrated with trying to keep it up and running that I couldn't consentrate on the story. I'm giving it a 2 star because I liked the other Law & Order games. Ho Hum, maybe next time."
3,Complete Package of 3 games is a better bargin.,"This game is only one game, I think it would be a lot better if you are interested to buy the three game package and save on shipping and price cost. The first intial game has a time limit and many ways the one that is the most difficult to play."
1,"Nice pictures, but a waste of time","I bought this book expecting to see a lot more information on the archaeology and actual history of Cleopatra's palace and Alexandria, but instead, found a sappy, pseudo-romantic fictionalized treatment of Cleopatra, Caesar, and Antonius. I wish the authors had included more examples of other palaces, some more maps and reconstructions based on other archaeology. If I had wanted a historical romance, I would have bought one. I feel this book was a waste of $$."
4,Nice Product,These are very nice and durable. I had a hard time sliding the glass in after mounting them but it was because I was putting it in upside down. I wanted a sconce that projected light out; and both up and down the wall. great product.
2,better than artificial sweetner but...,This product does dissolve better in iced tea than powdered stevia I have tried. However the liquid stevia still has a more potent sweetness.
3,Just okay,I Received the publication in a very timely mannet But publication was very old and several versions out of date
5,"Beautiful, lyrical and touching","As if we are the reader in the town Beyond the Wall of Sleep, Heidel's stories wake us softly, with the gentleness of the spirit and wisdom that can only belong to a genuinely talented writer. His voice may very well become the conciousness of our generation, describing the anxieties, troubles and the search we find ourselves in at the dawn of a new millenium. Whether through poetry or short stories, his understanding of the human condition is so evident that one only hopes to read another work of his soon so that we may continue to examine ourselves and grow through his writing. Such insight is to be treasured. Thank you R. Andrew Heidel."
5,Brilliant work,"Talk about baring one's soul in a variety of literary styles and genres. This is exactly what R. Andrew Heidel has done. In the nine short stories, readers glimpse inside the heart and mind of a surrealist soul. The poetry is simplistic but beautiful as the optimistic author pleads with himself and his readers to fill oneself up with life, love, and joy.Weird? Yes! Strange? Yes! Eerie? Yes! Well-written? Absolutely! Mr. Heidel takes his audience on a ride to the center of the heart and soul of humanity. Though The prose is a well written, interesting, and entertaining parable, it is clearly not intended for everyone, only soul-seekers. Readers need to realize that the characters such as the female incarnation of Death (not the comic book character) star in these brilliant short stories. The poetry is also enlightening as the author takes the reader into an introspective glimpse of the essence of being human. Anyone interested in something different will enjoy this special collection."
5,Wonderfully rich and absorbing collection.,"Highly recommend for fans of Neil Gaiman, Graham Joyce, and Tim Powers. Well written short stories and emotionally driven poetry that strikes at the human core. Can't wait to see what this new writer comes up with next!"
1,Won't buy this again.,I bought this workbook as a jumping off place for my 2nd grader in home school. My biggest complaint is that the glossy pages make it impossible to erase cleanly and that drives my son CRAZY.
5,Excellent book,"I always buy the math book for my grandaughters after they finish the school year.They loved it. One is going to four grade, and the other to third grade. Theylike to resolve all the problems and review what they learned on the school year.It help the kids to remember what they learn on the school."
5,Sums without tears,"This book builds on the information given in book one, it is clearly set out with lots of attractive exercises to attract a child to practice the basic skills in different contexts. My grandchildren aged 7, and 9, will happily work on it independantly"
3,Not bad,This book is great for a student very enthusiastic about math. It isn't as fun as a brain quest book.
5,Great Resource under $10,This is a great supplement for Math exercises. I have really been impressed with the books that DK made. Made Made Easy covers lots of math topics with a progress chart and answer book. The layout of each page is simple and direct. These pages are nice and durable compared to cheaper workbooks. Other reviewers mentioned they were displeased with the semi-glossy paper but it does not hinder the lessons because I try to encourage my son to not erase work but to get into the habit of focusing on answering correctly. I enjoy to use this together with Brain Quest 2nd grade workbook.
2,I want my money back,"My son finished the first grade book within two months, and he wanted to do more math homework. So I bought this book and third grade book for him. To my surprise, I found that about 1/3 of the material are copies from the 1st grader book, and another 1/3 of pages are copies from the 3rd grader book. We both were very disappointed. (...)"
3,Math Made Easy: 2nd Grade,This workbook would be perfect and complete simply by adding a paragraph of how to explain the exercises.
1,"Overall, very good","At first I liked this, but after a few weeks, I found it very disappointing. It doesn't tell me how to teach things, the paper is horrible, and the sequence of skills is odd. I'll probably use it as busywork if I need it (we homeschool), but I won't order another book from this series."
1,Awful,It changed the resolution on my PC and when I tried it on several different computers either doesn't work at all or crashes the machine when certain items are clicked.
2,Happy at first,WE loved the cd and was purfect but ordered 2 and both started to freeze up and would not continue
3,My older grandkids LOVED it but it needs to be updated so it'll work on newer computers.,"Would LOVE to buy a version that's been updated for newer Windows or MAC, but as the other reviews indicate, these older versions don't work well. Very disappointed that Living Books hasn't updated this timeless treasure."
1,Terrible,"It does not work on newer versions of Windows, nor Mac. It also has ads from America Online all throughout it. I don't need to PAY for advertisments ESPECIALLY AOL! AOL IS A VIRUS all in it's own. I would never have bought this had I known it wouldn't work with newer versions- and everything I've looked up for ""patches and repairs"" is a load of crap! NEVER BUYING from Bruderbund or whatever it is! I give it an ""F-"""
5,Quick Delivery,"Did not like spending this much but the refurbished units did not have good print quality from other suppliers. This unit was delivered quickly and seems to be the original Brother material but most important of all, works well - at least in the first 3 days of use. Decided to give this drum a try because my MFC4800 is the only one that fits in a drawer in my desk. A note of caution is be sure no staples are hidden in the pages in the feeder or glue of any kind on the edge of tear off sheets. These will ruin an expensive drum."
2,Poor Contrast,Installed new DR250 on Brother MFC 6800 and since then the printer quality has been poor. Poor contrast. Makes me wonder if the unit is and original OEM or some knockoff.
2,Electronic Chaos,"The product performed well on it's maiden flight. It is fast and performs as advertized. However, the electronic motor control failed on the third day. I e-mailed the vendor about the problem and stated that he would send another controller. Two-months later, I amd still waiting..."
3,Arrington??,"I just want to take issue with the first reviewer on this page who considers this records drummer superior to nico mcbain or even lars ulrich. I am a drummer, play professionally and have studied for some time. I always had trouble getting into this record bec the drumming was so weak and unimaginative. Back when I was 15 and did not know a tremendous amount about good drumming but I still thought this records drumming was very weak. Not that lars or mcbain are unreal or anything but this is one of the worst drumming records in metal. The singer is the only part of the band worth mentioning. He is into melody and has a unique and memorable voice. Too bad he didnt have better musicians to work with. Dude, if you want some good drumming, check out any meshuggah record, or death's gene hoglan (easily the most creative and intelligent drummer in rock, also in control denied and strapping young lad, which feature mediocre songwriting but absolutely mind boggling drumming)."
3,The 3rd and Last Metal Church Album To Buy,"The reason Metal Church never became big was because they weren't good enough and this album marks the end of the line, further albums being atrocious.There was the furious debut and the thunderous major label debut both with great songs. This one has some great songs on it but unfortunately they make up just over half the album the rest being below average. The other thing about this album is the sound quality, being their third album it should have sounded better, it is a bit weak and could have done with being beefed up.With albums after this one they didn't deserve the name Metal Church, more like Rock Church. These guys should have been there for us when Metallica got their hair cut but instead they were playing sub-metal which interested nobody."
5,True depth of research,"Researched beyond all prior literature, this well written book ads sugnificant knowledge to our understanding. Historians and attornies will find this book fascinating."
3,Nipple is too slippery when milk gets on the outside,"Compared to an older version of the bottle nipple of the drop ins, the bottle nipple of these become too slippery after a feeding. I would feed my baby, stop to burp, and try feeding her again only to find that my baby just mouths at the slippery nipple material. I'd have to switch it out for an older version to finish feeding her."
3,8oz bottles not as GREAT as the 4oz,"i just loved the 4oz bottles so much that i bought the 8oz so i wouldn't have to fill two 4 oz bottles for the 'bigger' feedings. well, i am not as happy with the 8oz bottles. my baby doesn't like to grab them and the liners are more likely to 'pop'/burst when you push the air out of them ... i RARELY have a problem with the 4 oz. i hate cleaning the dr browns and the dishwasher doesn't seem to get the oily formula residue off of them... but i will continue to use dr browns large bottle and the 4oz drop ins. just my two cents."
5,Only one I've ever used! Mother of 4,"I just had my forth baby and once again am using these bottles. My oldest is now 8 and I used them with her too. My youngest was very spitty. So I tried the Avent and Dr. Browns and my daughter hated the Dr. Brown and got to much air with the Avent. I dont mind the bags because now adays they have drop-ins. To the other mother who complained about the time it took to push out the air. I would rather take a few seconds and push out the air then have a fussy, air filled baby. I would recommend these to anyone. Hopefully they'll still around for my grandkids to use!"
4,Great Product,"I love these bottles! Not only is clean up a breeze, but they are also quick and easy to fix. My daughter had acid reflux, so it was very important that she not get air in her stomach when she ate. The collapsable liners were the best solution to this problem. I also love that they are quick and easy to heat up, and you can feel the temperature of the milk through the liner.I only gave them four stars because by the time my daughter need the 8 ounce bottle she also need the fast flow nipple instead of the slow flow, so I had to buy separate nipples, but I consider this only a minor inconvenience."
2,When they say colors may vary they are not kidding.,"This isn't review on the product it is a review on how they are listed on this site.When they say colors may vary I didn't think I would be getting pink ones but, I did. Be aware of this before you purchase they can send any colors they want to. The first set I got was 2 blue one green. The second set I got was 1 of each Pink, Purple, and yellow. Think next time I will be buying these from the store instead."
2,Ripped off,"These come in both boy and girl colors. The picture shows pink, purple, and yellow bottles. I received blue and green bottles. I contacted Amazon who promptly sent me another three sets (all of the first three sets were wrong). In the second shipment they only got one set right. I e-mailed to return these as well. When I sent back the five incorrect sets the company would not refund my money because ""they had already replaced the items"". Be careful when ordering from this site."
4,Great- but I like the old ones,"I used these with my daughter and mainly only at home. I prefer the older ones more. I like them because you can take the lid and snap it into the bottom of the bottle. With these, we always seem to misplace the lid or drop it and a rollin' it would go (collecting dirt). Not so much a hassle for everyone, but it was for me."
4,Excellent and Trusted Brand,This is a good product that comes from a trusted brand. Drop in liners bottles are popular with breast feeding moms and these ones are designed for babies comfort in switching between breast and bottle. Good to have on hand in the diaper bag or to add to a baby shower gift.
5,Great price for great product,I am very happy with these bottles. Took my daughter a while to get used to the nipples (we only use these when we are away from home) but she got the hang of it. Happy with the quality and the overall product.
5,Great value,Love the Playtex brand and this is no exception. The drop ins are great for the busy mom on the go. They are sterile and easy to handle with a baby in one arm with only one free hand. Not to mention that dads are work these as well.
3,I'm going to stick with my non-liner bottles.,"I wanted to love these but I just didn't--but it's completely personal preference. I used Avent bottles in the past (no liners) so I thought I would try something different for my second child because I had friends that just raved about these. Maybe it was just that I was used to the non-liner system from the first go-round or maybe I didn't like the extra step...but after going through the few included liners, I decided it just wasn't going to happen and I went back to Avent. My friends said they liked them because they didn't have to wash them...but you have to wash the nipples and rings anyway, so what's the big deal about washing the bottle, too? So, the bottles are perfectly fine...I just ended up preferring another style."
3,Useless measuring,"Overall this product is a hit or miss. We didn't use it much, mainly because you cannot really measure how much you're putting in it, so you have to use something to measure first, then fill this nurser up.Pros:- Easy to clean- Baby can drink from pretty much any angle (works similar to a straw)Cons:- No good way to measure the amount of liquid- leaks if turn upside down or on it's side (particularly bad if baby likes to play with the bottle and turns it upside down)- Baby seems to end up sucking more air when using these (though I did not notice any more gas)If your baby doesn't play with the bottle, and you already have all the baby food stored and measured, then this might be a good nurser for your baby. But if you use the bottles to measure the food, and/or your baby likes to play with the bottle, I would strongly recommend against this."
4,Very good set.,"This is a good, light nurser. Easy to hold and the baby took easily to the nipple.I did not give this 5 stars as the drop-ins were not included even though the box said they were.Other than that, these bottles are definitely worth getting.Thank you.MEF"
1,Get the measuring cup ready!!,"I thought these bottles would be great...until we brought our son home and went to put two ounces in. Only then did we realize that you can't go by the markings on the bottles (and you can't read the markings on the liners either) because it is so far off. Now I have to measure the formula into the measuring cup first...as if you need an extra step. Not to mention that if you don't rinse out the liners, your garbage will smell SO bad.I also agree with the other moms who wrote about the formula running down the sides of his face. I'm buying the Soothie bottles since he seems to be able to latch onto his soothie pacifier much better and suck on it better...feeding him with a playtex drop in bottle takes an hour!"
4,Tried so many and this is what worked best for us.,"I have tried so many bottles. Really, Avent, Soothie, Mam, Ventaire, Dr. Browns, Gerber, Evenflo, and Born Free: from the cheapest to some of the most expensive.These are not perfect but they are what worked the best.Pros:-wide nipple, baby preferred-cleaned easily-had few parts-could be warmed in a bottle warmer or hot water-didn't need special tricks to keep from leakingCons:-had to buy liners-measurements could be betterI got over buying the liners in two ways: I started recycling my liners and I started using the Playtex flat liners available here on Amazon which helped the cost a lot. I can buy 5 months supple of liners (5 bottles a day) for less than $30 shipped/taxed.The measurements are still not great but since I premix every day's formula in a large pitcher the night before, I don't have to have the exact measurements. I know now from practice at about where on the liners the milk needs to go."
3,"Bottle great, but bottles with push up for air release weren't","The normal bottles of this kind were great, but I tried the kind that had the plastic easy air release feature. The plastic air release feature did not work easily and was hard to push, eventually the knob broke when I was trying to push the air out of the bottle. Other than that the bottle itself is great, easy to clean easier to hold while feeding."
2,Not what I ordered,I was disappointed to find that they did not send me the decorated nurser. I got plain nursers in the old fashioned yellow color and just plain clear bottles. Since I have been waiting for them to arrive and therefore have not purchased any from the store I just plan to use them because I have no time to send them back and wait for another set. The box looks like old stock perhaps obsolete. First disappointing purchase from Amazon.
2,U Dont have an option to pick colors for your baby,"I ordered this for our upcoming travel so I don't have to bring my bottle sterilizer with me,I ordered this bottles for my baby boy, and voila!!! they sent me a PINK, YELLOW and VIOLET Bottle Arrghh!!! very disappointing :(("
3,"Happy with product, not color","The product is something that I used before. And I love it, but the only issue I have is it says color may vary and you are basically gambling with odds of getting a color you do not want. I am having a boy and ended up with pink bottles. Not a huge deal its still a bottle and can be used. But its a little annoying."
4,"Not sure about the liners, but product seems sturdy!","I'm not a mom yet, but am heading down that route and have been looking into baby products. Having admired the quality of everything else Playtex creates, I already feel good about these. The product seems durable, and a neighbor of mine also uses these very ones with great success! My only doubt is the use of liners, which strike me as potentially more trouble than they are worth. My neighbor assures me there are conveniences, though. The bottles themselves are very nice and attractive, and I think the set is a great price!"
5,These are so convenient and time saving,"When you have a baby, it is very important to optimize on the amount of time you have in doing your activities.That way, these are very helpful since you do not have to clean the bottles, worry about bubbles, reheating the milk.These come in 2 sizes for 4 oz and 8 oz and the liners are disposable, so make sure to buy a bunch of them. I would also suggest buying a muchkin bottle warmer these are very helpful to reheat milk."
4,Easy to use,We've been using these with our month old son's formula and they're a breeze. So nice to just throw away the drop-in liners rather than clean out bottles. This may get expensive in the long run but it's a nice option for now. The only issue we've had is that the nipple gets clogged with the Similac Senitive for Spit-Up. We tried to switch o the medium flow nipple instead but it's too much or him at this point. Obviously this isn't a failure of the bottles though and is just a result of the thicker liquid. All in all we're happy with the set.
5,love these bottles!,"I love these bottles. We started using them when my daughter was about 4 months old. I had used Dr.Brown's before, and these are so much easier to clean! The only downside is that you have to buy refills, but I just purchase the CVS brand refills which are much cheaper and often go on sale."
2,Nipples Don't Work!,"I loved these bottles for the first month I had my daughter. I went and bought about 10 from Babies R Us, and after 2 weeks, 8 of the slow-flow nipples didn't work. They get clogged very easily and forget putting them in the dishwasher- the holes seal shut. I called Playtex about this and they agreed to send me 6 new nipples if I sent them back 8 (?). Now I will have 8 bottles with 6 nipples, which will probably just end up clogging again. The drop-in liner idea is great and does reduce air bubbles, but I can't afford to pay for new nipples every 2 weeks."
1,Not for my baby,"My son is ten days old. I tried these bottles and was highly disappointed. The liners are a pain in the butt. Once you prepare the bottle and get the air out of it, if your child does not drink the whole bottle it collects air again. I changed to Dr. Brown's bottles and my son is having less gas and isn't wearing his food."
1,Miserable!,"On the 2nd day of use while trying to squeeze the excess air out of the drop in bag the bag edge pulled free of the bottle spilling 3.5oz of precious pimped breast milk all over me, the baby, the pillow she was on, the bed, bed skirt, the nightstand and the floor! This is an incredibly flawed system. If you try to squeeze the excess air out of the drop in bag your chance of either pulling the bag free or putting a whole in it is large. Plus the hole at the bottom to teach said bag is way to small for the average adult hand and has a sharp bottom edge to boot. Finally as the baby finishes the bottle the bag collapses into the nipple making it nearly impossible for her to truly finish whatever milk is at the bottom. And! If she breaks suction air gets in anyway! Steer clear of the for your own sanity."
2,Shrinks when boiled for sterilizing,Very very cute bottle but it has a huge flaw. I was instructed by my pediatrician to boil all nursing items for 20 minutes due to my daughter having recurring Thrush. I put this nurser in with other bottles my daughter had used that day because she touched the bottle repeatedly during feedings after having her hands in Thrush infested mouth. This nurser shrunk like a shrinky-dink! It shrunk to about 1/4 of it normal size. Strangest thing I have ever seen. Do not use/purchase this nurser/bottle if you boil your bottles to sterilize them due to you or your child being sick.
1,Worst product ever,"I had no idea what I was getting when I purchased this item. Yes, they are ""cute"", but they are made out of a very cheap, rigid plastic. This is not like the traditional Playtex nurser and will, literally, crack under pressure. What's more, this bottle was completely melted when I used it in my steamer bottle warmer. I do also have the traditional plastic nursers and have used them happily (with and without the bottle warmer), with great success.Do not get suckered in by the flashy packaging. Spend the extra couple of dollars and buy the tried-and-true original design.Playtex Baby Drop-Ins Original Nurser 8-10 OZ: TurquoiseUpdate--My comment is not about the liners, or excess air, etc. I have done just fine with the drop-ins and I love that I can still buy rubber nipples for the nurser. I'm speaking specifically to the quality of the actual plastic bottle."
1,Horrible bottles!!!,"pros - easy to clean- works like a straw as you only have to suck to get the air out and as soon as the air comes out the milk comes up so the bottle works at every angleCONS -The liners break when you try to ""burp"" them to get all the air out...would rather take the time to burp baby then the bottle.- measurements are WAY off (8 oz bottles will NOT hold 8 oz)- extremely hard to read the off measurements when baby has drank a couple ounces. i would ahve to pour the leftover formula into a regular bottle to see how much he ate which was bad when i thought he wasnt eating enough.- my kids had more gas with these.- leak all over everything if baby tips the bottle over on its side if he tips it upside down FORGET ANY CHANCE THAT IT MIGHT NOT LEAK"
1,very disappointed,"I love these bottles for my son, i usually just buy them in the store, but since they were less then they are in the store, i figured why not. But when I ordered them, I was under the impression that they were going to be the bottles in the picture, since there is no option to choose which bottles you would like to order. I received designed bottles for girls, when i emailed the seller she refused to refund all of my money and told me simply to ""give them to a friend"" or to ship them back and I would be refunded half my money, which is completely pointless since the cost of shipping would probably be the same as not sending them back at all. Not worth ordering these bottles & it was a waste of my money. DO NOT order bottles from this sender. Colors really do vary, since I got pink and purple butterfly bottles for my son. The bottles are great but don't waste your money and just buy them from the store."
3,Deceiptive description -- not decorated nursers,"While I love these bottles, I'm very disappointed in the description used. The description states that these bottles are ""decorated"", however they are the clear bottles with just a colored neck."
4,"Great bottles, but newborns beware!","This bottle is excellent in producing less gas. But, I DON'T recommend these bottles for newborns. The nipple is so wide at the top that my son kept getting a blister on his top lip. We had to switch to Gerber for newborns. But I look forward to using this bottle again when he's grown bigger in a few months."
3,Latching On,"I used the Playtex bottles since my daughter was just days old. the nipples were rather large and she had problems latching on and she was sucking in a lot of air and was really fussy. My mom suggested a different bottle. Her doctor suggested Dr. Browns. So although more expensive, I bought Dr. Browns and she loved them! I tried the Playtex ones again at 2 months and same thing. I have them, I might as well keep trying. After all they are much more easy to use."
4,Good bottles but use the latex nipples,"I love the drop-ins system. I have used both the old and new styles on both of my children. It's great for new moms because the bags cut down on dish washing time.My only complaint is the silicone nipples that come on the new style. Whether it's the slow or fast flow, they all leak horribly if they tip over. If my son dropped on in his car seat it would be soaked in seconds. I recommend using the old fashion latex (brown) nipples. They give the same effect to baby but hardly ever leak."
4,Great Bottles but...,"The only complaint I have is that I got girl colors and I have a boy...Wish We had the option to choose for boy or girl instead of ""colors vary""... other than that these are great bottles. I love the drop ins..."
2,Expect Fussy Baby,"Bottles were so cute that I really wanted to love them, especially being BPA free. Unfortunately inconvenient when they can't take a good boiling or steam cleaning...Measurements on side aren't accurate, but I wasn't too put off by it, since these were meant for supplementing breast feeding & I'm not too structured.This makes baby work way too hard-I actually considered widening the whole. I even tried sucking on it myself to get a better idea of the issue-Wow! The strain actually hurt my mouth. It was tough just to get a bit of liquid (and it only worked for us on an incline-I did not want to encounter broken bag trying to push drink through.Sadly, too much air injested=fussy baby and frustrated mom."
2,Ounce markers cute but not helpful,"This newer, cutesy version of the Playtex Nurser has a major design flaw - the ounce markings on the side of the rigid plastic shell holder are not horizontal LINES, which you expect for an accurate measure. Rather, the ounce gradations are marked by adorable but basically useless rounded leaves, bubbles, raindrops, etc. Where does the ounce mark truly begin? At the top of the icon? Bottom? Smack dab in the middle?? (Try eyeballing THAT at 3 AM!) Because baby is on a strictly liquid diet for at least the first 4 - 6 months, being able to obtain correct & exact measurements at feeding time is VERY important.I'm sticking with the less attractive but much more practical ORIGINAL Playtex Nurser. They are hard to find but worth it! They are also made of a much sturdier plastic than these flimsy bottles. My baby seems to be doing just fine with them and they're working well for us, though I'll probably switch to a non-liner bottle system once he passes the 3-month mark."
3,Nice...but one problem,"These are great. Nice design, will work for a boy or a girl and the tops for these are much better than the ones that are included in the original drop-ins starter kit. However, one disclaimer. If you have a bottle warmer, be sure not to leave these bottles in to long. The bottoms of the bottle will warp. Other than that, these are nice 4 oz bottles for a newborn."
4,"If you bottle feed, these are great","If you bottle feed, you need to use this system. They work great. The biggest concern when bottle feeding is of course, that the little one will get too much air into the belly causing pain and discomfort. Well, not with this product. Highly recommended. Buy and enjoy your snuggle/feeding times."
3,Good Bottle but not great!,"I have always loved the Playtex dropins bottles, and when I saw the new bottle design I was sold. Except for one thing, I tried to sterilize the bottles and they were warped from the heat. I am so glad I did buy them. I don't understand why this would happen its doesn't occur with the other Playtex bottles so now I just wash by hand and there is something wrong with this. And because of this I am giving it a lower rating."
4,Great for travel,"These bottles are great to use when traveling because you don't have to pack a bunch of bottles, just slip the drop in pouches in the diaper bag, with 1 bottle and several nipples and go! However, to use them everyday would cost more than washing bottles, and it is something else that ends up in the landfill.The refills are roughly $8.00 for 100 which is an expense you don't incur with regular wash and use bottles. Just a thought.The insert collapses as the baby drinks, so there is less air in the bottle for the baby to swallow."
4,Love these bottles,i hate having to wash bottles every night and these are a great time saver! Just throw out the liner and you only have to wash the nipples. Baby just loves them and so does hubby he does like to wash bottles either and he likes how once you push the air out baby can feed in any position as long as there is suction. i don't premix because you can't put them in the microwave but we have a bottle warmer so it works just as well. put the powder in the bottle first before the water or it won't mix as well
2,not a fan...baby hates them,"I was really hoping that these bottles would help my baby take in less air, like they advertised, but never really got around to figuring out whether or not they would have because she flat-out refused the nipple. I realize that babies have varying nipple preferences, but aside from these bottles, my little one will suck on anything you throw at her (and a lot of things you don't). But these nipples are long and hard and kept slipping out of her little mouth...frustrating for everybody. I'm sure the drop-ins are convenient, and it would be lovely to have her spitting up a little less, but unfortunately these are not the bottles for us.(Avent's nipples are much more like the real thing...baby loves them)."
1,Uncorrect Measurements!!!!!,I was using Life Factory bottles but I needed a bigger bottle while on a trip. I purchased this bottle. The first time I used it I thought that it seemed like the ounce lines where off. When I got home I got out a measuring cup and the liners for this bottle are off by a little over a 1/4 of an ounce per ounce. This doesn't seem like a lot until you think about the fact that for an 8 ounce bottle you are only putting in enough water for roughy 5 ounces.
3,Good bottle for travel,"I decided to try several different brands of bottles for our newborn and these seemed to work well, especially while on the go. The easy clean-up aspect of using the liner works great while traveling. While I probably won't use these on a regular basis due to the expense of having to buy liners, we'll continue to try them while traveling. There also doesn't seem to be any issues with leakage from the bottle. I haven't tried the pump and storage aspect of the bottles yet, but that is next to try with them, it seems it will make these bottles even more convenient to use."
4,Great stuff,"I love almost everything about it. I am a repeat buyer so the pros definitely out way the cons. Very realistic texture. Keeps you nice and wet after. and the most important for me is it didn't irritate me when things like KY and other store lubricants make me burn *down there* (NOT FUN!!) The reason I gave it a 4 instead of a 5 is because it actually turns to like.. a glue residue? Not really sticky, but on your *kitty* it will dry up and look like dry glue, or on your toys or whatever else it gets on. and if you can imagine.. rolling your hands together when there is glue? you get those pieces of rolled up glue, it's kind of the same affect when you are having intercourse or toy, it leaves those little rolled up pieces. but it's nothing too serious, this is the first one I have tried off amazon and I liked it otherwise so just sticking with it. great price too"
4,Good value but needs antibacterial antifungal feature,"As advertised, this lube remains slippery for a long time. However, I wish the manufacturers of personal lubricants would find a way to add an effective antibacterial and antifungal agent, non-irritating, so as to increase the safety of toys."
1,Contains paraben,All these reviews and not a single mention of paraben? I'll only buy lubricant that mentions paraben-free in the reviews for now on.
2,It's too thick,"When you first put in on, the viscosity seems fine. But within a minute or two it thickens considerably, almost making it like you used nothing at all. Who wants to have to stop to either add water or reapply after a minute or two? I'm kinda busy by then! I will not be purchasing again."
4,good product especially if you are allergic to glycerin,Recently I tried several personal lubricants including vaginal lubricants. I was shocked to find that I got a yeast infection. I deductively reasoned that I was allergic to glycerin. I surfed the net and found Slippery stuff samples were available. It feels like my natural lubricant use to be before menopause. I definitely recommend slippery stuff.
5,Amazing!!!,"This product was recommended to me by my doctor because of how sensitive I am,whether or not you are sensitive this product ROCKS, its odorless, tasteless, and so smooth, not sticky at all! I will never use anything else"
2,Too much water...Pass this product,"There's too much water in this product. As a result you have to use more then intended. Also, the skin on my hand keeps becoming soggy liken to when you take a swim for an extended period of time. Pass by, not worth the money"
2,Slippery Lubricant,"I personally did not like this product. It dries up and when you add a little bit of water, it only lasts as long as the water you add would. I am going to try a silicone lubricant next."
5,Great Stuff,"This is great stuff...and awesome value for the size that is being offered. Odorless and of good viscosity so therefore, satisfied with this purchase."
5,Slippery Stuff,"This product is wonderful for people needing this type of help. Recommended by my doctor, ordered it and used it. Will be ordering it again."
3,for future buyer,I used this camera for 4 snorkeling trips. The picture quality is fair. Lithium batteries are highly recommended. The LCD underwater sometimes turns off so you won't see your pictures until out of water. It lasted for 18 months. So as they say cheap sometimes can be expensive at the end. The advantage is that is covered already so no need of case and is easy to shoot & even take videos though this takes away the battery very fast. It's good in the short term.
4,Camera dont function with super heavy duty batteries,"The camera takes a bit to get use to but functions well, until your on a trip and batteries need to be replaced. I only had super heavy duty batteries left and the camera would not function, I thought it was broken.I came home and put in alkaline batteries, then rechargeable batteries and the camera functioned.Overall I am pleased with the camera, but have not attempted to take any underwater shots as of yet."
4,not a bad unit for the price,"For what I paid, this is well worth the money.It's quite a hefty/sturdy camera, which does the job of underwater photography well. It feels sturdy and should be able to take some impact and waterproof.Things could be better:1) quicker focussing: you cannot use this for sports since it's quite slow2) no photo preview right after you took the picture3) better strap: the little loopy thing which hooks to the camera should be more sturdy4) optical zoom would be nice.5) video is very low res (400x320), and sound is choppy. And you cannot use zoom during the video.6) white balance is sometimes inconsistent between shots. If you're pickyperhaps you should set it at a setting instead of autoOverall, for the price, nothing comes close at the price point you get it at Amazon. Underwater cameras are a niche and very expensive.Overall, I am happy with the purchase. No trouble with the shipping, it came as expected on time and in good shape."
3,Just OK,I thought the photos were fair. Some came out pretty well while others lacked clarity. I had to clean up the photos using Corel Paint Shop Pro. Overall I was disappointed.
3,Camera good for the money,"PRO: The camera performed as advertised on a recent snorkel trip. Pictures taken were good. Camera focus performed well. No leaks.Cons: The display in the water is absolutely USELESS. This is definitely a ""POINT AND SHOOT"" camera. Not unlike a FILM camera.Recommend taking multiple shots of subject to make sure you have at least one good one. Also have additional batteries."
3,Worth the money,"I wanted an inexpensive waterproof camera for the beach. After checking out the cost of a disposable camera coupled with the cost of developing and printing the pictures, I decided to go with this Vivitar. The pictures taken came out really good. The strap was secure and the camera did float as advertised. I also followed the reviewer's comments about making sure that the battery compartment was secure and closed before taking it back in the water. I also dropped it in the sand, but it cleaned up quickly in the water. The down side was that the camera turned off a lot if you were taking alot of pictures. Also the LCD screen is difficult to see if you are in the sunlight. All and all, it was worth the money and it will continue to get use when we go swimming at the pool. Note, instructions included in the camera were minimal at best, so I'm sure I haven't figured out all of the setting yet."
3,vivicam-6200w,"Just received my Vivitar underwater camera. I will not actually be using it much till late april when I vacation in Cancun Mexico. For now I have only tested it out of water. The buttons appear a little stiff but funtion well. Very compact case that should work well . The photos that I took for test, were quit good, so I can not wait to use it underwater."
1,"controls ""froze"" when wet","Was excited to get this item which arrived quickly. Took it to Mexico and the first time it got wet in the ocean, it took 2 pics. and the controls froze and I couldn't shut it off. Rinsed in fresh water and dried it and by that time the batteries had run completely down. Put new batteries in and it worked fine again (in a fresh water pool) for about two underwater shots, after which it froze, and I rinsed it again and...three more times. Same result. Unfortunately, we didn't get back from our trip soon enough to return this lemon (not referring to just the color), so I guess I'll have to get it replaced under warranty. Unfortunately, I don't think the warranty covers loss of our once in a lifetime vacay pics..."
3,Crowbreeze,"While the energy isn't exactly off the charts (previous rawer drones exchanged for a more streamlined diversity) HW always keep true to their space/stoner rock label they helped create, where dated effects-driven silliness can sit aside immortal, often instrumental intrigue without hesitation, sadly leaning towards the latter, especially towards the final stretch here."
3,LEMMY S TOAST,"hawkwind sounding bored and listless, {ALTHOUGH ITS BETTER THAN DARK SIDE OF THE MOON} what happened? this is a majorbummer after HALL OF THE MOUNTAIN GRILL, ITS EXTREMLY SLOPPY ooze too boozy GUTTER ROT, LIKE GUM STUCK TO YOUR SHOES ITS infuriating from a band that ought to KNOW better! it was a shock then hearing it again today it even more baffling. this kinda badness will rear its ugly head in other albums not all but many to come..."
2,"Disappointing! ""Bold Print"" isn't Bold. Difficult to follow.","I'd read one negative review warning of this problem. But having no idea of how the Harmony worked, I didn't understand. I bought this book in the last month. Now I understand. The publisher failed the reader (and the author--this is a second edition) by making the 'bold"" print not distinguishable enough from the regular print, making it a frustrating chore to try to follow the narrative of the life of Christ. I showed it to my 33-year-old son tonight to get his opinion, since he has younger eyes. He too had the same problem. Sad. The publisher robbed the reader of what I believe WAS originally a wonderful book."
2,I don't like the format,"This isn't what I expected. I expected 4 columns, one for each gospel, with blank spaces where appropriate. Maybe this would've used more paper, but it sure would've been easier to navigate. With *very* close inspection I can see that there is a boldfaced narrative as promised, but it's not especially bold. It's hard to distinguish the boldface from the regular font. And I don't care for the little titles over the various subsections. Maybe a few footnotes or an appendix explaining where/why the gospels differ on various points or why Daniel placed chapters where he did, but all those titles and varying formats really interrupts the reading. It's not at all what I was hoping for, I'm afraid."
5,Great for Christians studying at secular schools,"This book provides the parallel passages you need to easily compare the accounts related in the gospels and connects a single storyline from each gospel into one. In the first 5 minutes of reading I have already been enlightened on a SEEMING contradiction by seeing the accounts side by side. There is in fact no contradiction as I had originally thought. This book was written by a Bible scholar who graduated from a Southern Baptist seminary and who has served as a missionary. As opposed to some scholars who constantly try to point out contradictions, he believes the Bible and offers suggestions for resolving what some might see as contradictions. The bolded storyline helped me to view the narratives in a different way from before. This book is a great help and will serve as a great resource as I take a course on the New Testament at a secular university."
5,I love this music,"So okay, I am a big sentimental goop! But we all are at times, and when you are feeling particularly sentimental and romantic, in my opinion, there is nothing better to wallow in than this album. Michael Feinstein puts everything on the line when he performs, and I for one, appreciate it, because he is not just technically talented, his voice and delivery have a direct line to my emotions. Do I feel manipulated? Nope. This man truly loves this music just as I do. I have been listening to this album for 10+ years and I still love it. Relax in a warm, soothing bath of sheer romance. He transcends sexual orientation, just as Johnny Mathis always did. Who cares? Romance is romance and no one does it better than Michael Feinstein."
3,Feinstein's voice on this CD has sweetness but no variation,"As one who absolutely loved Feinstein's ""Pure Gershwin,"" I was disappointed with this effort. The sweetness is there, but he sings each song at the same emotional pitch and without any force at all. It's just a mess of stringy goo.For comparisons, listen to Mel Torme do ""Isn't It Romantic,"" or Fred Astaire put all the sarcasm it deserves into ""A Fine Romance."" Producer/Arranger Johnny Mandel should have solicited a separate opinion before he released this one."
4,"Attractive and practical, but needs weight balancing","Of all my jewelry storage, this is the piece I aesthetically like best. The major downside is that if you have the top two tiers swung open, the bottom has no independent stability and you have to hold it to prevent toppling. Still, a lovely box of nice size, quality and design ... just be sure to store something heavy in the bottom tier!"
3,"A little awkward, but good.","It looks nice, but is a little awkward to open. It has plenty of storage though."
3,Ok box,"It's pretty good, a little small but that's ok. The only thing i don't like is that only one section has the magnetic catch, so only the top slide apart section catches against a magnet. The other section you just have to line it up and it easily moves apart again."
4,beautiful box,"really beautiful box. it's going to be a gift, so i haven't put anything in it. other reviews said when the top two are open, it's unbalanced. i don't see why you would need two of the pieces open at the same time, so it won't be a problem."
3,Nice design but awkward for actual use,Lovely wood color and design. Umbra products are almost always solid. As you opened the box layer by layer it would tip. Not as functional as I would like.
3,It works,This is a clever design and deserves a better instruction sheet than the one that came in the package. I've used it less than a half dozen times and would perfer a manual sensitivity control but can live with the nebulous automatic control. I am satisfied that this tester does what the seller claims but its not a marvel.
1,circuit detective,The product stinks. It only works on some of the circuits.It was a total waste of my money. I only rated it with one star because other wise this would not go through.
5,It works!,This product works as advertised. I have both circuit breakers and older screw-in fuse panels and Circuit Detective readily found the individual circuits in both panels. I used a two-way 'handi-talker' to communicate with a helper who plugged the transmitter into circuits while I used the detective to locate circuits. Nice tool!
4,Excellent for $20,"The only problem I had was when the battery is first installed it comes to the ON state. Turn it off by pressing and holding the the switch until the light goes out, then follow the directions. This worked perfectly. The more expensive models wont work either if you dont follow the directions."
1,Wrong as often as right,"I used my HTP-6 Circuit Detective for the first time yesterday. The instructions seemed simple; however, I went to the web site and watched a video demonstrating how to use it. I thought things were progressing well until I checked the circuits by closing the breakers involved. The HTP-6 was wrong as often as it was right. So, what is the point? Perhaps I have a defective unit. Still, now that I have done the legwork and identified all of the breakers associated with all of the outlets and fixtures in my home, does anyone want to buy a once-used HTP-6 Circuit Detective which may or may not get you electrocuted?"
4,Hi-Tech HTP-6 Circuit Detective,This device works fine as long as the instructions are followed carefully. It did get confused once or twice indicating that a circuit could be powered by one of two adjacent circuit breakers. But when I removed the panel cover I noticed the wire from the correct breaker had been routed down near the breaker below before angling away. This is a fault of the eletrician that originally wired the panel and not the HTP-6 and appears to be a common problem.I would have given this 5-stars instead of 4 but for the overly sensitive on/off switch.
2,Works Sometimes and on Some Breakers,"Works, with a little indecision on my home panel- useful there.On my son's panel- inserting the transmitter trips the arc fault breakers (which I believe are becoming standard and required in many residential installations)! No use at all there!"
1,Hard to use,I could never get topo maps to download to the unit. I was on the phone with Busnell for over an hour and they were suppose to call me back. Never did. I also learned that you can only download a very small area at a time. So I bought a Garmin Colorado 400T instead. It has the entire USA topo maps pre-loaded!!
1,DON'T BUY! IT IS JUNK!!!!!!!!!!!,Bought this product because i lost my garmin. What a mistake!!!!!!!!! Basemap is has nothing on it. Takes for ever to lock on to satallites. screen got scratched wiping the rain off of it with a soft glove. Tried to have bushnell refund my money got no support took them a week to even respond to my e-mail.
1,No support for this item,"I got this produce and it was new and perfect. The problem is, the manufacturer no longer supports this item. I can't get the basic maps or purchase any of the obsolete ones. It is a brick!"
3,$99 Steal,"I bought this unit because it was on sale for $99. It works good. The base ""map"" is very sparse. Overall it's a cheap Gps unit. If you want one with full maps, topos and aerials, you're gonna pay for it. I just wanted a small unit to mark trails, distance and speeds. This unit does that well.You get what you pay for. It's better than the Backtrack, for a couple of dollars more. It works for what I need. Marking deer stands, trails and geocaches.3 stars because it doesn't even come close to the more expesnive units available. 3 stars because it deserves some credit for as good of a unit that it is.I would buy it again."
1,Don't bother watching this disappointing movie.,"I wouldn't recommend this movie to ANYONE. And that's a shame. It could have been a great movie, if they had only stuck to the original script that is the book of Esther. My copy of this DVD is going into the garbage. I wouldn't want my children or anyone else watching it, since it's not the biblical story of Esther, though it purports to be, and I don't want anyone believing that it IS the true story. The truth is MUCH better than this made-up nonsense. They should have stuck to the original, or else called the movie by another name."
1,Read the book!,"I was very disappointed in this movie. It was boring and not true to the book of Esther. Just read the story in the Bible, it is very exciting and touching. Why they have to change the story is beyond me. I bought this, watched it once, and will not watch it again. If you are curious, just rent it. If you know your Bible you will be frustrated."
5,LOVE LOVE THIS MOVIE,This movie is about someone destiny...a person can take this movie as inspiration for their life. Esther stood up for what was right even though she knew the bad consequences of her actions. She had FAITH...she BELIEVE..we all need that sometimes.
2,Don't waste your time,"I would only watch this if it was free to watch. It's not terrible, just don't go in expecting a whole lot of Biblical accuracy. I just thought some of the most important parts, such as when she was going to the king for the first time and at the very end as well, was a little anti-climatic. It could have been done a lot better. Just don't go in with high expectations."
5,Excellent,I really enjoyed the movie! I hope to see more and more Biblical movies come to the big screen. I will definitely be buying the DVD the day it is released in January!
2,Review of One Night With the King,My purchase of One night with the king was disppointing as I was unable to play it on my dvd player (here in New Zealand) due to the different zone areas world wide. However I won't be making any more purchases with Amazon unless there are the recommended zones for the dvds.RegardsMarlene Wharerau
5,One NIght With the King,"One NIght With the King was a very easy viewing, the DVD was in perfect condition.The Story line was taken from the Bibical book of Ester, the story was well orchestrated and the garment for the era were outstanding.Would higly recommend this for viewing or for collection."
3,A 25year old's review,"So,I'm obsessed with wanting to play the character of Esther in a major Hollywood film with the calibur/budget of that of Lord of the Rings... either her, or I'd like to play Ruth in a LR Trilogy of Ruth, David & Solomon.That said: I had high hopes for this film, but I mean... it does drag on.. as a girl, I have to say, some of the outfits are quite cute, and I'd love to wear them.. .the message? Well, they adlib some things, like some guy friend of Esther having a crush on her.. I don't recall reading that in the Biblical account...I think it could've done w/out that.. and various other ""not in the Bible"" things... I don't care for those parts.. I love the story of Esther no matter what, so I'll watch this film over and over again, but my friend came over and I wanted her to watch it, and she fell asleep, so there you go.It'll make you, or your friend go to sleep if they aren't as enthused about the story of Esther as me."
1,MORE JUNK FROM TBN,"This vanity production is a sad attempt at a Biblical epic. A waste of time, talent and celluloid. Poorly written and talky. Screenplay is bloated, boring and tedious. Stilted dialog is painful. Oddly directed (I use the word loosely). Some OK attempts at ""sweeping vistas"" from India locations do not an epic make.Imagine having Peter O'Toole and Omar Sharif available for on screen reteaming and to waste that opportunity!There's a great story here without ANY agenda (evangelical or otherwise) but this is not it. Too bad.I am baffled by the good reviews posted here."
4,Inspiring and wonderful!,I really loved the movie. The story was faithful to the Bible but the film also created an imaginative background that allows us to envision the time in which Esther lived. And the actors did a great job in breathing life into their characters and making them come alive. Highly recommended for those who love the story of Esther.
5,Great Family Movie,This movie had to be one of the best and most dramatic movies of 2006. The plot and drama was outstanding the on location scences were breath taking I felt as if was actually taken back into Bible time and that Esther. was a close friend. As a student of the Bible I found the story line to be honest and true to it's content. An excellent movie for famlies. Matt and Laurie Crouch done an excellent job in producing such a beautiful peice of work.
3,One Night With the King,"This movie is a good film, but I was disappointed with the way it did not follow the bible."
1,Biblically inaccurate,My husband and I were told by some of our Christian friends that this movie was very good. After purchasing the video we were extremely disappointed. Many aspects of the Biblical account are changed that destroy the beauty and purity of the biblical account. One of the most distressing ones is that the King and Eshter are shown to have a long standing lovers quarrel over the misunderstanding that each of them has been messing around with a member of the other sex that isn't resolved until the day of the banquet. We don't feel that it is pleasing to the Lord for His Word to be handled as it was in this movie.
5,Great service!,"The service was excellent! My order arrived promptly, before the estimated date, and the item was in the exact condition described by the seller. I will be buying from them many times more."
2,disappointing,"I was really looking forward to seeing this movie but was disappointed as much fiction was added to what already would have been a better story.The cinematography is beautiful but the acting and especially the screenplay were disappointing. Some of the ridiculous elements added include a magic crystal necklace and a boyfriend who gets made into a eunuch.A much better movie of the Esther story is ""Esther"" made in 1999 starring Louise Lombard and F. Murray Abraham."
2,disappointing,"Have seen all the earlier versions of this story, and even though the cinematics, costumes and overall look of the film were good, the story was wimpy, not true to the actual story and very disappointing.If you want to see this story in movie version, look for one of the earlier makes."
2,Sadly disappointed,"Perhaps it was because I expected something quality like the Gospel of John, but this movie did not hit the mark. It was a ""Hollywoodized"" version of what is a fantastic Biblical story - that needs no aggrandizement. In an effort to support Christian films, I have generously given it two stars."
4,"Could have been better, but definitely not bad!","I just saw this movie yesterday. I had read the story of Esther several years ago, so was somewhat familiar.While watching the movie, I did not know if the movie was bibically correct or not, but after I went home, I took out my bible and reread the story, and it was surprisingly accurate. There of course were some Hollywood details that were added, but I do not think that they distracted from the bible story because the bible does not talk about them.I do have to agree that the filming and lighting could have been much better, but I think that once you get past that aspect, the movie is pretty well made. There are some pretty moving moments with music, such as when Esther approaches the King. It would have been nice if the entire movie could have been filled with that passion.Nevertheless, I enjoyed the movie and have just added it to my wishlist from Amazon."
1,Awful,"This movie strayed way too much from the original Bible story. If you are an unbeliever and never knew the story of Esther you would wind up very confused watching this! the character of Esther was a breezy and casual woman, when Israelite women in those times were very humble and meek having been broken by the tragedy they had witnessed after being taken into captivity. Although it briefly touches on her losing her parents, her overall attitude does not reflect any seriousness of what was historically going on at the time. It reflects the casualness and rebellion in this modern era. We were very disappointed."
2,Did not live up to its potential,"I don't remember seeing the release for this movie at the movie theater but once I saw the advertisement on TV I had to buy it. This movie had great potential, it had great actors, it had a great story line but it did not live up to its potential. With court intrigue and battles this movie should have been exciting but frankly it was boring. Rent it before you think about buying."
4,one night with the king,"It was a pretty good movie.Sound was hardest part. Had to turn it up so much to hear words, sound affects were to loud.I'll watch it again and share it with others.Thanks"
4,Better than I thought,Tiffinay dupont did a great job playing the lead and telling her historical based story which has been done many times. This biblical story is better than most and this DVD is worth getting if you like History and Bibilical stories.
2,That's your best?,"I watch TBN and heard all the glowing words from the people Matt interviewed in theater lobbies. So, I went to see it one Monday afternoon. The first part of the movie was easy to follow but as it went along it made less sense. I felt as the movie neared the end; it was like they put things in that came out of nowhere. The scenes between Tiffany and Luke were so plastic; lovers just don't behave that way! Anyway, as I walked out, I said to myself,""Is that the best you can do?"""
1,Bad movie!!!,"This movie seems to have been made by a bunch of amateurs who had hollywood connections and money. Scenes of the city with waterfalls.....just a little overdone! Looks like they tried to borrow from ""Lord of the Rings"" just a little too much. And what is it with that Star of David necklace? When did the Star become a Jewish identifier? Actors??? The only saving graces were Omar Sharif, Peter O'Toole and John Rhys-Davies (just because a movie has big names in it doesn't mean it's good). I couldn't quite understand Luke Goss's character, Xerxes, most of the time. This story could be made into a good movie in the hands of talented professionals."
4,One Night With the King,One of the best productions of a Bible story I have ever seen. Good actors and great sets. I enjoyed it very much.
4,Well done,I thought it was an excellent story. There were a few times that I couldn't follow what was going on. Hard to hear.
2,Bad and Good Parts,"The bare skeleton of the plot of the biblical book of Esther is in this movie. Actually, they ended much closer to the original story than I thought they would. However, they added so much to the story that at times it was hard to recognize. Yes, they took a beautiful dramatic, but very short story in the Bible and stretched it into a very long movie. At times, it seemed like an eternity. However, there are some good points. Esther use of the stories of the Bible was very good. Some of the scenes were actually touching.It was a good try, but they took too many liberties with the story, historical facts, and the CGI. A seminary student should go through this story and point out all the historical inacurracies. That is a little sad. However, they did try to place the story in its historical context, which I did enjoy. The dialog at times creaked and at times soared. I don't know if I recommend the movie, but the producers' hearts were in the right place."
4,It is what it is...,I did not watch this movie critically but I thought it was great. I enjoyed the story and it was in fact what it claimed to be. I would recommend it!
5,Great dramatic adaptation of the account of Esther,"This movie is a great drama that contains some historical background to help the viewer understand the times better. I'm not sure if ALL the things presented in the movie actually happened, but I think that the main point of the Biblical account was very evident in the movie."
3,Little Similarities to REAL Bible Story!!!,"If you just want to watch this as a movie fine. If you're looking for any similarities to the book of Esther in the Bible you will be VERY disappointed. ""Creative License"" is another way of saying nothing alike."
1,One Night With the King DVD,"I was so excited to get this movie. However, I am greatly disappointed in this particular one. It is an abreviated version of the original, leaving several important parts out. I don't understand why this would have been done. Don't get this particular DVD, you will be cheated out of much of the story. I feel like I should be able to get a refund, including the postage it would take to mail it back. It ruined one of the best stories of the Bible!"
2,One Night With the King,"Not a very acurate account of the Biblical story of Esther. If the screen play writer had used the facts, the movie would have been much more interesting. King Xerxes was portrayed as sympathetic and caring. He was just the opposite, self absorbed and out of touch with his kingdom. Esther had 2 banquets for the King before making her request known and she did not run in the rain, looking haggard to see the king. She was dressed in her finest gown after 3 days of fasting and came before the throne, beautiful, yet unannounced. The movie length was fine and for entertainment purposes, it was worth my time. Just don't go in thinking it will be much like the Biblical account."
3,Oy Vey...,"So... I wish this had a 2.5 star option...This movie is not very accurate when it's compared to the story in the Bible. One thing that bugged me was that in the Bible, Esther finds favor with the king early on- in the movie she's walking on eggshells the whole time around him. Also- what is going on with that psychedelic necklace?? LOL- where did that idea come from?!With that being said... I like chick flicks as much as anyone... and (with the historical inaccuracies aside) this film is ULTRA cheesy. ""Cheese-fest"" was how my husband described it... so watch with caution."
1,Horrible butchering of the real story,"Honestly, I will make this short and to the point. The Biblical version of Esther is perfect just the way it is! Why change it in so many ways? Basically, they destroyed a wonderful story, that needed no embellishments, and ""Hollywoodized it."". Greatly disappointed!"
3,entertaining but not always accurate...,the movie was entertaining and had lots of cinematic support. but it is not as accurate as careful study of esther will reveal.
2,Overdone!,"I relish in movies based on the Bible that are both true to scripture and historically accurate. The good news is that this movie was, for the most part, was in accord with the Old Testament Book of Esther; however, the production itself was more of a Hollywood extravaganza than one that accurately depicted the dress and lifestyles of the historical period. The King looked as if he was ""in drag"". Perhaps my grandchildren best described it by saying it was ""cheesy"". My wife did like it, so maybe part of my reaction is just a guy thing."
5,great film,"My family enjoyed the biblical romance story. It arrived on time before the holiday. The cd is in ""new"" condition without scratches."
2,very disappointed,"I am sorry, but this movie, from the very beginning had the overwhelming feel of unauthenticity with the very poor, overdone acting. The characters were played as if they are right out of the 21st century from the way they talk and look, to the way they behave. It was not a believable film at all to me, therefore, I could not continue watching it. The acting, directing was just horrible in my opinion. That's all I have to say."
5,One Night with the King,"I absolutely love this movie. If you are a fan of Biblical movies then this movie is for you. I love the book of Esther in the Bible and this movie is based on Hadasseh, a jewish girl whose name is later changed to Esther. What a work of art. I love how the actors made you feel like you were there with them. I could feel the love the king and Esther shared and the downfalls they shared. This is truly the best movie I have seen. Be prepared to ride an emotional roller coaster. It's great!! When a person can actually experience what the movie characters are experiencing is a phenomenal experience. I can watch this movie over and over again and never get tired of it. I thank my Lord for allowing this film to be made."
4,Enjoyable,"This movie was quite well done. Naturally, as always, Hollywood takes its liberties. The one scene that was drastically changed was the idea that Ester came to the King inappropriately dressed.The Bible says the opposite.Also,the King was not upset with Ester as he offered her up to 1/2 his Kingship for her petition. Yet, true to the law of the Medes and Persians, the Kings edict could not be changed. Yet, Israel was given the freedom to defend itself."
5,A BEAUTIFUL MOVIE!!!!,LOVE THIS MOVIE!!! ONE OF THE BEST PORTRAYS OF QUEEN ESTHER. THE MUSIC TO THIS MUSIC IS SO BEAUTIFUL TOO! I LOVE IT. I SO WOULD RECOMEND THIS MOVIE TO ANYBODY YOU WILL CERTANLY ENJOY IT AS MUCH AS I DID!!! ALL THE ACTORS AND ACTRESSES DID SUCH A WONDERFUL JOB IN ONE NIGHT WITH THE KING.THIS IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE BIBLE MOVIES OF ALL TIMES AND MY FAVORITE PORTRAY OF ESTHER OUT OF ALL THE OTHER ESTHERS MOVIES IVE SEEN!!!!!
3,Story-telling could have used some work,"The Story of Esther is a powerful one, but sadly this movie lacked the ""umph"" it needed to really convey its significance. The movie was shot on location in India which was a valiant effort to make the kingdom of Persia look authentic, but the acting came in fits and blows. Despite the star power, some actors were brilliant in their delivery while others were not. Tiffany Dupont did a nice job as Esther, but there was no consistency throughout the movie. Some actors had British accents, others American, etc. While this shouldn't be a deciding factor on the story-tellting, it is very distracting.The script: predictably medieval for a time that happened thousands of years earlier.The costumes and the sets were the best thing about the movie. Not a bad effort but could have been done much better regardless of budget."
3,One Night with the King,"The content is not sufficient enough, costumes and acting is so so.It can be better."
5,Purim,"I really enjoyed this movie. I know it is a dramatization of the Bible story, but it did follow the plot line of the Book of Esther. I work in an Adult Day Health Center and the majority of the participants are Russian Jews that know nothing about their faith. I showed this to them to give them an idea of in what danger Esther put herself and how Purim started. I showed this to them the Friday before Purim began. They all enjoyed it. All of my co-workers wanted to borrow it. I think that bodes well for this movie."
5,Queen Esther,This movie brings back memories of Cecil b deMilles epic dramas from days gone by . Excellent in all facets and scriptually sound wit a Hollywoosd blast. Highly recommend
4,Watch as entertainment,This movie does not claim to be fact. It was made purely for entertainment. How many movies are worth watching today? Not many. This was worth watching. I enjoyed it and so did my 15yr old son. He is a real critic. Acting was just fine. It is based on the story of Ester.
3,Not nearly as great as the Bible Esther.,If you're not familiar with the bible version of the real Esther then you will enjoy this movie. But I believe anyone who is curious to know more about the real Esther should read about her in the Holy Bible or buy the Bible Esther on VHS. Anyone who does will see the truth behind her true story and the virtue she truly possessed. You won't regret it.
4,"Very Good Movie, Love, Betrayal, Salvation.","This follows the Bible story closely in the major facts but the ""embelishments"" are not Bibical. One does well to read the book first then this adds a beautiful picture in ones mind of the characters and the Palace.I enjoyed it very much. Doing a Beth Moore Bible Study and watched this again just to have the visuals to go with the deep study of the book.Highly recommend to those who enjoy Bible film, especially Jewish settigs."
2,Podcast Review,Hear a movie review of One Night with the King by critic Kathryn Bernheimer (author of The 50 Greatest Jewish Movies) on The Book of Life podcast's February 2007 Purim episode at www.bookoflifepodcast.com!
4,Movie review of One Night With The King,"I found the movie entertaining, with realistic settings, and a cast that is closer to what the people of the time possibly looked like. I've also found the movie helpful as a teaching aide in teaching Esther from the Bible."
2,"Badly made ""Bollywood"" Product","The whole thing was shot in India, all the extras are Indian. About half of the dialogue simply can't be heard, sounding like the mike was in a rainspout while the actor yelled into the other end. The supporting cast is using a baffling assortment random fake ""accents"" that mangle the rest. It's like watching ""The Osbournes"" and trying to guess what Ozzy's saying. This movie just seems to have been cut together from random Bollywood clips. The errors are too numerous to list."
2,Nice... But Nothing Compared To The Novel,"I saw this movie in the theaters. I was drawn to it because I had fallen completely inlove with the book. <Esther has always been one of my favorite Bible stories and I loved the way that Tenney had taken it, and combined with history's Xerses, whom Biblical historians believe was Esther's Xerses. He added a few fictional characters for the the flow, and I believe it was outstanding!>The movie was hardly anthing like the book itself. It even added a little 'magic' in the film when only those who had God could see the stars that Esther's necklace gave out.Perhaps if I had not read the novel, and was moved my 'enchantment' in a 'non-enchantment' movie, I would have liked it.That is truthfully all that was wrong in my eyes: Hardly anything like the book, and no part of 'fantasy' belonged in this kind of story.If you haven't read the book, I will admit that you will probably enjoy the movie. If you are fan of the book, the movie just kills it to me!"
1,The Story of Esther.... Sort of,"I was glad I saw this movie for free on T.V. Now that I saw it I'm done. It was dramatic, and cinematic... but hopelessly flawed. It would have made a better picture book than a movie. It was cheesy, kind of like a forties bible movie; but with better costumes, sets and effects... and only slightly better acting. It was very unscriptural, with many of the changes damaging to both the characters and the overall story. Both were filled with unpractical holes. Esther in particular was played as a flighty, silly, goofy girl, who somehow still wins the heart of the king. The biblical Esther was not recorded as flighty, silly or goofy. She is portrayed as having a habit of going out alone after dark, something an unmarried girl would not have dared to do. There is a much better version out there, titled Esther, far superior in every way to this."
3,One Night with the King,"Hey! I would like to see this one done over! It is a tremendous theme, a marvelous true story, and an awesome portrayal of a king who loves the queen, yet of a queen who knows the awesome power of the king! Let's redo this one!"
2,Disappointing and Inaccurate,I was disappointed with the producers and writers putting their own spin on this movie instead of keeping the facts of the Bible. I was so hoping that after I read the story of Esther in the Bible that this movie would help give more understanding of how it really was. There was a lot of fluff and some of it was so opposite of what the Bible said. I wish more realistic and factual movies would be made.
2,Not so great,"When it came out, the movie was highly recommended to me. We showed this movie to a group of about 25 women. The costumes and settings are visually stunning, and there are bright spots in the acting, but it was historically inaccurate to my knowledge and was too slow for all our tastes. The King mumbled and the story line does not follow The Book of Esther, which makes a good story on its' own without the added plots. Not terrible, just wish it had been better!"
4,historical Esther broght to life,"One of my favorite books in the bible is Esther because it deals with the Jews in the Persian Empire. This movie expands the plot with extra dialog and has very rich costumes and scenes.The Hebrews were a subject people that in many cases mean they were slaveswith little or now rights. This movie makes Haman into a Persian Hitlerwhose conspiracy to kill all the Jews fails. That Jews have not been a ""beloved"" people in the empires that conquered them is no historicalsecret: it is the subject of novels and much of their history past the bible as well. The major problem seems that the virtues attached to Jews living their faith make them prosperous even when others around them are failing. I liked the movie, but the building although maybe Persian or at least Islamic are all of a latter architecture than that of about 300 b.c.Domes that weren't built until the 13th century a.d. are part of the skyline."
5,EXCELENT MOVIE,"REALLY BEAUTIFUL, THE BOOK OF ESTHER ITS BEATIFUL, we thought long and hard, it's nice to have IN OUR LIBRARY FOR OUR CHILDREN to see."
4,Evil Roy Rides again,Great deal for the old fans of John Astin.... Not only the 2 movies but a great looking tin embossed box... WHAT A DEAL
2,standard TV movies,"I'm not going into the story lines, since those have been covered. I just found these movies to be pretty standard TV movie comedies that did not have any real laughs. They are humorous, but not that funny. I did not hate them, but can't really recommend them either. But at the sales price offered sometimes, you can own 2 movies for less than renting them, so maybe worth buying at that point to judge for yourself."
4,A national treasure!,"I am jazzed, gassed and just plain old excited about having found this double DVD tin of John Astin at his wackiest. I remember these movies from along time ago and I howled with laughter. The sight gags are plentiful and the side jokes are so subtle that you might miss them or get them 20 seconds later in the movie.Of the two, the Brothers O'Toole is my favorite; The movie is definately under rated and under appreciated."
4,Great game.,"One of the greatest games ever, been playing it for a long time and still can't get sick of it. Bought again because I lost my serial number. Worth buying it."
5,Great Game,Frozen Throne is a great expansion to a great strategy based game. Only problem I had with this game is that I wasn't able to play a custom game online with my friend. Other than that the online play is good and the campaign mode is great fun.
5,We're all playing.,"I bought this game for my kids to play, but guess what, I'm enjoying it too. It's a fun and challenging. It's kept us playing for weeks. I highly recommend this package. Also, I find the level of violence to be acceptable for my young teenage children."
5,great value,"Although it's older, this is a good, entertaining game and the price was right for what is in the box."
5,playing this in 2012,"I love this game and I have been playing it for more than 5 years and im still drawn to it, its a great game and I prefer it over starcraft II, a must buy for pc owners and this can be played on any pc no problem."
5,Great Game,Warcraft III is a great fantasy game. Easy to learn. Looks good. It even runs on my Pen IV lap top computer. Most games do not. The on-line guide is very good. So you don't have to read the handbook to start playing. Warcraft III always has add-ons so you'll get a lot of play out of it. Well worth the price. Wyatt Kaldenberg
4,Warcraft III,"I like this game immensely!It's fun, and addicting. I guess you could say that about the whole Warcraft line!"
5,Best RTS Ever,"I've been playing this game since it came out and I still love it. Starcraft is nice, but what I love about wc3 is that it combines alot of the micro elements from RPG games with the macro elements from starcraft. The heroes are awesome, units are awesome, maps are awesome. I mostly play FPS and RTS and this is probably my favorite game of all time."
4,"Battle for lifetime, RPG for one week","I love this game the most. I've played W3 and extension FT for a long time, and I still enjoy it. This chest is way better than the single CD case. People who purchased this one should know what I'm talking about. Perfect contents inside!!!I gave this one 4 stars out of 5 because the RPG is boring. I believe it is the only negative part of this great game. I almost finished all storyline for one week. However, I think there will be some update on the internet. But that will never be the reason to keep your hands away from this chest, it's the best game in the best case after all."
5,Bought the chest to play Dota.,"One day I was hanging out with my friends, and I saw them playing Warcraft Dota Map on Battlenet. I had so much fun watching them play that I told myself I have to get into the action. Spent less than $30 to buy the chest on Amazon. Got it within a few days with free shipping. In my opinion, nowadays $30 can't even get you a full tank of gas anymore. This chest provides me with hours of entertainment with my friends, all for less than $30!! I think getting it is a no brainer and a bargain."
5,"Amazing! If it weren't for the winter Steam sale, i would be playing this non-stop","The game includes a manual for both Warcraft 3 (WC3) and Warcraft 3: Frozen Throne, AS WELL as little cute strategy guides for both of them as well. The best part of this game is not it's Campign, which runs a good long while with a very nice story, but it's Mod-ability (or ability to modify the games).The two biggest downsides I found were:1. Even on Easy, the AI skunks you in Multiplayer2. LANing with your mates is harder, and I was expecting Starcraft 1's easy ability to create a game and play with local friends easily."
4,GREAT GAME! LOADS OF FUN!,"I am currently at a deployed location and needed something to do every once in a while when i was alloted a little spare time, so i decided to order this game. Delivery was very fast and the game is awesome! this should hold me off until i get back home plus more. great game, nice storyline, overall awesome! definately worth the money!"
5,Best Real-time strategy game,This is the best RTS game I have played. It's very fun and it came with 2 very good guides.
5,14 year old was ecstatic to receive this,"Bought this for 14 year old boy at Christmas time - he immediately opened and couldn't wait to share it with us. Nice packaging, attractive, good size, happy with this purchase"
3,A good strategy game - but more for kids.,I very involved plot with good UI and AI but seems geared to the comic book crowd. Play Rise of Nations or Medieval Total War if you want a more mature game.
3,oooook games,i own this games it is not great it is just ok. i havent played it in so long. i give it 3 stars because the games play is good.
2,Horrible,"This is one of the worst games I've ever played. The RPG element is almost non-existant. The RTS element is incredibly dumbed down -- just build a few soldiers, a few archers, a few spellcasters, and a few artillery, and attack, and that sums out every campaign mission and online game you'll ever play. The story is ridiculous, it's a copy of Starcraft/Brood War almost to the letter -- you start as good guy, good guy turns bad, you play as formerly good bad guy, then you beat the bad guy who commands the formerly good bad guy. Every creature you face talks trash to you right before you kill it, along the lines of ""you fool, you DARE challenge me!"" Every single time. Just about every cutscene involves some idiot getting tricked into joining the bad guys, like in Brood War except even dumber.If Blizzard hadn't built up so much goodwill with Warcraft 2, Starcraft and Diablo, this game would have been in the bargain bin after two weeks. 0/10 and may god have mercy on your soul."
4,A Good Collection,"If you like any of the Blizzard Games such as Starcraft, Diablo, Diablo II, World of Warcraft, or any of the previous Warcraft games this game is certainly worth getting. The Battlechest is a great way to purchase this game because you get the original, the expansion, and the strategy guides all in one neat package.StarCraft Battle ChestWorld of Warcraft"
4,Well worth the $,"I'd played the first two and enjoyed them a lot. This one has a TON of gameplay and I haven't even gotten to the expansion set yet. Its not especially challenging, as I've only ""died"" 3-4 times through ~40 missions. That may be more of a function of learning how the CPU opponents think than anything, though. Anyway, for the price, you really can't beat this deal--the number of gaming hours per dollar is exceptionally high and the story is fairly engaging."
3,Not as good as Starcraft,"This game featured a new 3D setup , which with the hero system I believe made the game more complicated than it needed to be. Being an active starcraft player, I found the mechanics bogged me down when I tried to play the campaign missions. I just hope Starcraft 2 isn't built like this game was."
2,A Big Disappointment,"A couple things to note:1) There's no support for widescreen play... All the characters are squished on my laptop and even cartoonier than intended.2) There are harsh and constant limits on unit production... So my fond memories of attacking the enemy with massive armadas are but memories.3) Because of that, the gameplay really depends on leveling and managing one or two hero characters. Micro-managing single characters is not why I came to this game.Conclusion: I got this game hoping to resurrect the fun of WC I&II; and Starcraft that I played in college... No such luck. I would be better off with Lord of the Rings: Battle for Middle Earth. I'm glad I didn't pay full price for it."
4,Exactly What it Says,"If you like the old Warcraft games, World of Warcraft, or fantasy RTS in general, you'll love this battlechest. The guides are less than useful and printed in incredibly small font on pocket sized books, but the games are top notch.Working your way through the two games' campaign modes will take a goodly deal of time, and it also leads right into the story of World of Warcraft (including explaining the mysterious Blood Elves from WoW's new expansion). Even after you've conquered campaign mode Blizzard's Battlenet is available to play custom and standard games with players all over the world.There was nothing surprising here, I liked Warcraft III, so I bought the battle chest to get it and the expansion. Two solid games, and as long as they are so cheap together, you might as well get both. ^^"
1,BEWARE: NOT comptaible with lion,"I loveee warcraft III. I have been in love with it since it came out many years ago and still am. The only issue is that although my love for the game has stayed true, its has not kept up with computers.[blizzard] doesnt care about its customers that they wont make money off of. They must figure not many people that don't already play warcraft won't be buying it all of a sudden, so they won't update the installer to work with a LION on mac. Its DOES work with snow leopord and older versions of OSX, just not lion. If you have a resonably new mac, just so you know, there is no possible way to play this unless you partition your hard drive to have snow leapord or something...RIP warcraft..."
4,Great game,"This is a great set and includes everything you need. If you enjoyed the original Warcraft or the insanely popular Warcraft II, then you will love Warcraft III. I wish the graphics were slightly better, but overall they are excellent, and the cut-scenes are fantastic.Plus, this is a great value...getting all this for $35!"
4,Baldur's Gate 2,"Very playable and fairly easy to learn; perhaps a little constrained in what you can do, but a nice balance of characters and styles. The graphics are a dated but the action is good and the story line -- as far as I have gotten -- is interesting."
3,never had the chance to enjoy it,"This product was not at all what I expected to receive. The picture represents the PC CD, not a DVD ROM, but a DVD ROM is what I received. My system does not play DVD ROMs. I have had positive experiences with Amazon in the past, and never had a problem like this, receiving something different than what I had ordered, but I am hesitant to but from Amazon again. If you are reading this, then Amazon is being ethical. However, I assume this review will never make it to the public eye."
3,Baldur's Gate 2,"Excellent Service - Excellent Seller [It was exactly as advertised. You can buy with confidence.] - Excellent Product - If this is your genre, you should really enjoy this game! Thanks for a great deal!!!!"
4,General Review,"I am a computer and techincal nerd at heart but I'm just so flyy. Lol, but the game is something I use to play and never finished so i wanted to finish so that I can move on to the next one. I enjoy it alot and it was so affordable."
3,No Manual !!,"This is a review of the collection. Being a fan of the Icewind Dale series, and wanting to try a game that was more an RPG and less a hack&slash, I ordered this game. I just opened it and started playing last night, and while the game seems great so far, I'm very disapointed that a manual was not included. If I would have known, I'd have gladly paid the extra $$ to buy these 2 games seperately. It's probably going to turn out to be a 5 star game, but this product only rates 3 because of the missing manual."
3,Good game - but beware,"Overall, this is an excellent sequel to the original Baldur's Gate series. But beware, if you have a wireless mouse, especially itouch, you won't be able to play the game at a level that you would like. Apparently, there is a bug with the software which the programmers have not, nor will not, fix. Spells will not cast, characters will not follow your directions, etc. Some people have had success by disconnecting their wireless equipment and hard-plugging another into their computer."
3,its a oldie but a goodie,its a game that your gonna need alot of time with. it's boring at first but it takes off after awhile but slow at alot of parts. i enjoyed it very much.
1,This game is NOT for windows XP!,"Like a lot of other deceptions, this game is NOT for Windows XP. Baldur's Gate couldn't be programed by official company or fansite(as with Ultima) to run on XP. It is not possible. The same could be said for Ultima Collecton which stated it was for windows 95 RIGHT ON THE BOX and doesn't run on that os. Please put the correct OS for this game.Deception #2: This game only contains what BG Saga contained, Baldur's Gate. It is not an ""Ultimate"" Collection, so don't expect BG II or ToB. It is just another name for the same thing(and for bux) bottom line, if you have BG, stick with it and play it on your old windows 98 system that your so fortunate to own, don't mess with this! If you don't have BG(by now) then your too young to appreciate it!"
3,Find an original copy,"Baldur's Gate II is the best RPG I've ever played. That being said, this is an poor release. The original box came with a durable spiral-bound 263-page manual/reference guide, very useful for looking up skills and spells while playing. The Ultimate Collection only has the manual in PDF form on the game CD, so you'll have to alt-tab out of the game every time you need to look something up, and deal with the awkward Adobe Acrobat software. I recommend trying to find a used copy of the original game, with manual."
4,Baldur's Gate 2 Collection,"Every disk and the packaging was in good shape, no noticeable scratches or damages at all. Game play is fun however I hadn't thought that it wouldnt work on my computer due to hardware differences so I could not immediately install the game."
4,awesome game. misleading description,"The game plays great, but it came on dvd roms versus cd rom. also the disc were labeled wrong for throne of bhaal and shadows. also no soundtrack, map, or instruction manual. they used to the original product description and this is by no means the original. still great game that plays great, but again description way off"
4,"5 stars for SoA, and 3 for ToB","BG2:SoA was one of the best RPG's I've ever played. There's a tremendous amount of story, and so many characters to choose from. The plot's great, and I like the lack of linearity with the side quests. BioWare's Infinity Engine is by far one of the most fun interfaces I've used for any RPG.BG:ToB, on the other hand... well, this one wasn't so hot. There is an abrupt change in pace, and the story seems kind of thrown together (especially if you import directly from SoA). The characters are still great (Sarevok is absolutely necessary for ANY party!) and the battles are a bit more interesting. Unfortunately the story isn't."
2,Les Mis - Andrew Lloyd Webber,An OK album.but limited in coverage of the great man's music. Renditions are acceptable but I am confused as why a tribute to ALW would include songs from another composer....I wonder who was confused...........This is not a must buy by any means
1,uh. . .,Les Miserables and andrew lloyd webber have nothing to do with each other. WHY are Les Miserables songs on a recording about Andrew Lloyd Webber?
2,Not current information,"This book is relatively out of date. It deals mostly with the older PIC processors and techniques. The basic microcontroller data is there, but not in a clear format. I got it to help instruct a friend on microcontrollers, but I did not use it. Myke Predko's books are far superior,"
2,A very sketchy overview,"First a warning: This book assumes you know basic electronics. If you don't know how to tell one end of an LED from the other, or worse don't know there's a difference, then this book isn't for you.The section on intro to hardware is non-existent. The section on software is incomplete. The section on procedure, including emulation, compilation and burning (which for some reason the author refers to as chip 'blowing') are also incomplete. The example circuits are repetitive.It does, however, give a good overview of the different families of PIC processors.Overall the manufacturer's databook for the PIC processors would probably be more useful."
5,Very little knowledge of electronics needed to understand..,"I have a degree in Mechanical Engineering and needed to use microcontrollers to control things in various design projects. This book explained the PIC so well that I now use it where I never though possible before. This book is a must for anyone wanting to learn how to use a PIC, even if you don't have a strong background in electronics (very basic knowledge required to build your own circuits). Even my buddy Twigs could learn using this book."
4,Good for the novice,Written at a PIC 101 level and as such is fine. Less useful as a reference as your skill level improves
2,Misleading cover.,"On this song, only about 6 of the contestants shown actually sing. Only 1 of those is one of the female singers (no Carmen Rasmussen, apparently.) The way they sing together sounds terrible. Song is boring. Second track puts even fewer singers. Overall, a boring, worthless cd. I only bought it to get autographed at the American Idol 2 mall tour. I suppose it's good if you want something cheap that has a picture of the top 10 contestants, however small those pictures may be."
4,"Nice Contestants, Nice Song.","The single itself is good. The final 10 voices meld together nicely on Bacharach's new arrangement of his classic song...especially the end part with lots of lovely, overlapping harmony. The second version, with only Clay, Ruben and Rickey seems like a hastily thrown-together b-side. All three have wonderful voices, but they all sound disjointed and out of place in this arrangement. And.....if any American Idol higher ups are reading this, why isn't Ruben's first single ""Imagine"" and Clay's first single ""Bridge Over Troubled Water?"" With a television show that stressed the importance of song selection, I am surprised with both songs selected as first singles for Clay and Ruben."
5,A must have CD!,"This is a fine compilation CD that makes all the finalists sound so wonderful. I especially liked ""At Last"" by Julia. A good cover version of each song by each artist. What great talent!"
1,Movies are of Poor quality,I would not buy this product or any other DVD made by Timeless Media Group. Very poor quality. They spent more on the metal box then on the movie.
3,I don't get it,"I really don't understand what this is supposed to be about. I certainly didn't get anything meaningful out of it. The points made about the various grahas are very basic themes familiar to anyone who knows something about jyotish. The Saturn story is an elaboration of the trials and tribulations of sade sati, but I didn't really get anything out of it. I would like to be able to understand this more deeply; maybe I just missed the point."
3,Unita fizz,"Beautiful voice, but the songs and her presentation style are repetitively the same, over and over on the album. Telling one song from another is difficult."
2,defective--check your packaging,"Top part of sprayer was missing, but I didn't notice until after I'd thrown away the packing... seems like an odd thing to lose, so it must not have been on the bottle. Am experimenting with other nozzles, this is not pepper spray after all. The bit I've been able to get out just smells like citronella. Maybe I can use it for mosquitoes.Bottle is larger than a lot of other sprays, rather big to carry around."
1,no clip-stupid design,"Didnt even think about it-but heres a really important consideration...this item should come witha clip or quick access! As it is designed with no clip I have to dig it out of a pocket to use. Then it could be to late, especially since I got it to use when riding my bike. I would not recommend this product for that reason alone."
2,Very inferior to Polybius and to Livy,"Nothing to say about the edition: it is good.The author, however, is very inferior to Polybius and to Livy as a narrator and his sense of Spanish geography is deplorable. So, what does he bring to the party?I recommend you buy one of the others rather than this one."
2,I have an issue,"My two biggest problems with this movie are the scary bad-guy character and the language.I got this for my 2 year old. He's sensitive and if he sees a cartoon or a person on TV fall down, he gets all upset. So imagine him watching this and seeing the big, scary, bloody-eyed (that's what it looks like) bad guy constantly trying to kill and eat the ""kid"" dinosaurs! It's just too much for him.My other issue is the language. It makes me nuts, and I fear it will set my son back. Instead of rain they say ""sky water"" and instead of ""leaf"" they say ""tree star"", and on and on. If you know the words ""tree"" and ""star"" then you would certainly know ""leaf"". Same for the others. I want my son's vocabulary to grow, not regress. He repeats new things he hears and they become part of his little lexicon.I try not to let my son watch this one. Maybe when he's older...but that language issue will still make me nuts!"
1,Great Comic. Terrible DVD.,"Perhaps the worst tribute DVD I have ever seen. Jump cut editing will give you ADD (we're talking literally two-second sound bytes!), the grabs are pointless with very few comedians talking about Pryor getting more than one sentence in before they jump to the next trendy talking head. None of them say anything funny or enlightening either, which is surprising for something that is supposed to be a comedy/tribute DVD. A handful of Pryor clips from an existing concert (just one) and two short clips from the Richard Pryor show. The sycophantic background laughter at EVERYTHING their interviewees say (and I mean EVERYTHING, it's pathetic) is really grating. And there's too many terrible comics on here - Margaret Cho, Cedric the Entertainer, George Wallace, Jamie Foxx and a bunch of sub-Martin Lawrence jarheads. Spend your money on one of his live concert DVDs. This is rubbish made by people who think they have a sense of humour. It's a beer coaster."
2,"Worth a look for fans, little else here","As you have gethered by now, this is not a complete Richard Pryor stand-up show. I Ain't Dead Yet, originally aired on Comedy Central, is a tribute/biography/documentary of the legendary comedian, showcasing clips of his various acts shuffled in with interviews and opinions from Steve Harvey, Jamie Foxx, Chris Rock, Jon Stewart, Dave Chappelle, Denis Leary, Whoppi Goldberg, and Robin Williams among others. The program itself, which is less than 45 minutes long and is here in all in uncensored glory, is worth a look for fans of Pryor who didn't see it when it originally aired, but the DVD features are scant, and considering the price of the DVD, this is a rip-off. All in all, worth a look for fans of Pryor, but for all others, this is worth avoiding."
1,What a rip off.,"My husband and I just finished watching this and to say we were disappointed would be an understatement. We were under the impression that we would be watching Richard Pryor doing his amazing standup and what we got were small clips of him interspersed with comedians putting their two bits in, copying him, and all this other garbage. I don't even understand how this was supposed to be entertaining in any way - it was quite simply totally annoying and pointless. We fast forwarded through most of it that didn't involve Richard. Don't buy this."
2,Nosferatu17 fom Soweto,"Let's be honest here, this IS a rip-off. After all the cut and paste done by the editors, one would expect a proper show to begin, preferably with some unseen material, then it ends briefly in the middle of a huh! moment. The marketing and packaging was good cos those who bought it, like me, thought it was another obscure, raw and previously unrealesed material by Mr RP the genius. It does this great man a HUGE disservice, may he rest in peace. For someone who got a standing ovation as he entered heaven, this dvd does not do him good."
2,Not that funny,"I was expecting a glimpse of some of richard's funniest acts. the DVD does not do that. It merely interviews people who knew him and give you a glimpse about his career with some takes from some of his stand up shows.I was under the imppression that I am purchasing a DVD that shows some of his funny shows, stand ups and maybe a DVD of something new about richard. (A never before seen show or something like that)Never the less, He never fails to be the funniest comedian that ever lived."
2,It is not what I thought it was.,This is about other people talking about Richard Pryor with a fe clips of Pryor.
2,Not a stand up....,"If you want Richard Pryor's stand up, just buy the stand up dvd's. This is bunch of comedians talking about Richard Pryor's other stand up (which due to this dvd i ended up buying) and Pryor's stand up career.I didn't really read the descriptions so I'm not sure what it says, but this isn't his stand up."
4,Trivia for your car!,"We enjoy playing this Scene It? in the car. The board collapses too easily, so it's a little hard to hold. We just use the DVD for the questions, and play without the board most of the time. It's great fun, and makes travel time go by quickly!"
4,Only the head is dishwasher safe,"All of their spatulas are great. One thing to note: although the detachable head is dishwasher safe, the wooden handle is most certainly *not*. If you want to use your dishwasher, you'll have to take the head off, throw it in the machine, and wash the wooden handle by hand."
3,Arrived with a cracked wooden handle....,"There were 3 deep cracks. I rubbed it down with mineral oil, but really think this one could have had a bit nicer handle."
3,Raw Sienna it ain't,"Second sight will be a welcome addition to my collection but it does lack the raw power and the edge of earlier works such as Raw Sienna ( Savoy Brown ), City Child or Nowhere Road. Nowhere Road remains my favorite when it comes to solo efforts by Chris Youlden. As with many artist Chris Youlden's later works seem to loose the conviction of his earlier works. Recording quality is mixed in that the instruments are well recorded and produced but vocals are somewhat edgy. Probably the best recording of Chris Youlden's voice is the track "" Love and Pain "" on City Child produced by Chris himself. In any event "" Second Sight "" is a stylized, listenable if a somewhat watered down effort from one of my favorite vocalist."
2,"No Savoy, No Blues","After recently swallowing the entire Youlden catalog , Savoy Brown style, ( Getting to the Point , probably the best blues ever laided down on one LP), it was disappointing to find this 90's experiment by Chris. The only thing I can say to all is , pick up Luther Allison's Hand Me Down My Moonshine if u want to here how to make a blues album today. How about releasing those 2 efforts after savoy brown, Chris, and lock up that mechanized rhythm section, and throw away the key, pls."
3,Boswell's Life of Boswell,"In its time I'm sure that Boswell saw the commercial advantage (and likely popularity) of publishing a journal of his travels in Scotland with England's preeminent genius. Sort of like some little known writer taking Stephen Hawking to Tierra del Fuego. But with the passage of time, it is Boswell overshadowing Johnson that makes this book worth reading. The prose is crisp and mercifully unaffected by the stylistic impenetrability of Johnson's writings. One can see the journal as a travel book, but it is more akin to an 18th century version of William Least Heat Moon's ""Blue Highways"". There is an argument to be made that Boswell's prose has had greater impact on the english language than the entire Johnson canon. Worthwhile."
3,Ok,"Standard material, and honestly, there are better texts out there, even online. The proofs are clear, but my feeling is that the author could have picked up speed a bit faster without sacrificing neither depth nor clarity. Look somewhere else or check it out in your library before buying."
3,Nazareth - 'No Jive' (Griffin),"Although I only have something like a half a dozen Nazareth CD's,I can tell you that 'No Jive' is a decent all new material effort.Almost as good as the last album I've heard of theirs,'Sound Elixer'.The disc's first two cuts,""Hire And Fire"" and ""Do You Wanna Play House"",I remember they included in their set the last time I saw them play live.Those two as well as ""Keeping Your Love Alive"" and ""Thinking Man's Nightmare"" are the best tracks here.'No Jive' has the trademark hard rock vocals of Dan McCafferty fully intact.Guitarist Manny Charlton left awhile back to be replaced by Billy Rankin(2nd guitarist on the 'Snaz' 2-lp).I notice the cover art here is similar to that of their 'Exercises' lp.I can NOW hear where Axl Rose just might've got some of his influence."
5,Great because of the political content,"""Blind Man's Zoo"" is one of my favorites because of the overtly political content of the lyrics, written by Natalie Merchant. I don't always agree with the fine points of her politics, but I share her distrust of conventional history and the status quo. Of course, when she's writing about other topics, like teen pregnancy (""Eat for Two""), her words are also very appropriate and poetic. But I can't resist her poetic stories of American political & cultural failure, and that's exactly why I like this album. The music is great, her voice is fine, and the lyrics are extraordinary."
3,Some Gems But a Bit Spotty -- 3 1/2 Stars,"This is a transitional record for the Maniacs, coming off the tremendous success of In My Tribe.It produced two certifiable gems, ""Eat for Two,"" and ""Trouble Me,"" and is worth picking up for these two alone. Merchant's confidence is growing, and her songwriting is picking up depth and dimension.There are, however, a few clunkers. While I have no problem with the political statements on a few tracks, I do find the lyrics a bit obvious and the arrangements uninspiring. In particular, the drum work is derivative and there are few moments where it appears the guitar is going for an Edge-type soundscape, which to me doesn't fit in with the other elements of the Maniacs style.I prefer the more upbeat tracks, those where Merchant is stretching out and finding her voice. You can here it developing here, in bits and pieces, and it's an album you'll enjoy if you find that journey intriguing."
2,"10,000 Manic Depressives","It's tough to follow-up an album like ""In My Tribe."" Here's your proof. This stuff is generally as melodramatic as a soap opera but there are some nice songs including ""Eat For Two."" For anyone that thinks the Maniacs just cannot be without Natalie Merchant, give this a listen for this is about as lame as her writing gets.The cover is nice, though."
2,Completely Maniac,"This disk is why I stopped listening to 10,000 Maniacs. If I want to be depressed I will think about a Republican president. I'd rather my music not take me by the hand and lead me down."
3,"Adequate Guide book for Rajasthan, Delhi, and Agra","This particular version of the Lonely Planet Guide Book for Rajasthan, Delhi, and Agra (in India) is adequate. But the similar Rough Guide for the same region is better, having more detailed descriptions and being more visually appealing due to its greater use of color. For instance, the Lonely Planet book has less than 2 pages about Akbar's capital city of Fatehpur Sikri while the Rough Guide book has 8 pages."
4,This Guide is THE GUIDE for a trip to India,"This Guide really helped us plan our trip in Northern India. We arrived not knowing where we really wanted to go and what we wanted to see. The Guide helped us plan where to stay, where to eat..and gave us enough information to help us distill what would be exciting for us. After reading about Pushkar..we hired a driver and arrived in a city that filled all of our expectations and hopes! We ate at the recommended restaurants and they did not disappoint. India is a country that is big,amazing and difficult to navigate, Lonely Planet showed us the way to having an unforgettable trip."
4,Travel through Rajasthan,"Useful book, particularly when it comes to estimating the everyday prices for taxi's, hotels and merchandise. Tips for bargaing are quite good. Worth following. Prices and admissions for monuments are sometimes quite different but that may be always the case. Overall good travel companion."
2,Makes your cards look cheesy,"My unhappiness with this product has more to do with the incomplete description. I was not aware that these cards had ""micro-perferation."" I had been using the HP greeting cards that were just an 8.5"" by 11"" folded in half. When I received these cards, I realized that due to the design, the finished card size was 4.7"" by 7"" so I had to redesign my Christmas cards (and my envelopes) because I didn't have time to return these and buy more.The perferation allows you to print to the edge, but when you remove the edges, you get a fuzzy edge that makes your card look cheap. The cards are flimsy also. Buy HP instead."
4,A very atmospheric hack-and-slash adventure,"The Icewind Dale series is not particularly deep or complex story-wise, but it does have a great mood and some wonderful scenery to explore using the now-antique - but beloved - Infinity engine. The atmospheric, haunting score by Jeremy Soule adds a lot of depth to a chilly, frost-bitten landscape filled with endless hordes of unpleasant creatures, foul NPCs and very interesting magical items.The whole setting seems like something ripped out from Beowulf or the Viking sagas, replete with sacrificed warriors and vengeful gods. Though no longer the state-of-the-art in graphics technology, the Infinity engine's prerendered backdrops hold up quite well in comparison to today's rather bland 3D technology, and the spell animations are still quite good.Play this game for the lonely, howling-wind atmosphere and intricate set-piece environments. If you're looking for more story depth, try Planescape: Torment or the Fallout series."
4,Icewind Dale trilogy game,"We are enjoying this game very much. We would not recommend it for anyone under 13 as it is challenging even to us as adults. There are so many factors to consider when deciding strategy!I would prefer the video to be more bright, but my husband likes it as it is, so I guess that is a matter of taste.The role-playing is very true to form as compared to R.A. Salvatore's characters and because of this, we believe it to be beneficial if players would read his books. I especially like the voices of the characters making comments while battling vicious creatures, or while healing your comrades."
4,Excellent Package,"Great game, very enjoyable with many features. Character creation is awesome, with good implementation of D&D guidelines. Lots of fun to play, very lengthy. The replay value is raised by the amazing variety of choices during character creation. I had no technical issues with the game running Windows XP with a 2.4 ghz, 256mb ram, and 64mb video card."
1,OC first book- shocking!,"I happen to love the show OC and was excited when i saw the book but when i began reading i immediately saw i was not going to be impressed! The book was almost identical to the show, usually when programs are made into books there is always an added story line or an extra twist that did not happen on TV. This was exactly the same and the only few sentances the auther did add in were stupidly thought of and were inconsistent with the show. I think the only reason this book is selling is because it has the name OC"
5,Lovely book,"This book was a favorite with my three youngest children when each of them were around two years old. It's a delightful little collection of MOther Goose rhymes.Each rhyme is introduced with a question- 'Where did Little Miss Muffet Sit?"" Each rhyme has a two page spread with sweet illustrations. The illustration includes the answer to the question, but that is underneath the flap. Lift the flap and see and read the answer. For some reason, my toddlers just adored this interactive format. No matter how many times we read the book, they liked to guess at the answers. They lifted the flap so many times that our copy is lovingly put together with scotch tape and contact paper, and still has a place of honor in our collection of MOther Goose rhymes."
4,pre-cyberpunk,"_Dr. Adder_ by K.W. Jeter is about a dark and violent Los Angeles of the future in which terrorists can be heroes to a disaffected youth.One of society's idols, Dr. Adder, can, for price, plunge into a client's subconscious and dig up his or her deepest sexual desires, then provide the necessary surgical modificationsto fulfill those desires. Hoping to wreak vengeance uponDr. Adder and break his stranglehold upon society, hisequally dark foe stages a violent end for Dr. Adder which is ultimately fought in a cyberspace-like melding of minds and television networks.Action-filled and a quick read, this book is recommended for fans of a sort of dark, pre-cyberpunk in the style of Philip K. Dick."
5,Great series of books!,For the non musician as well as for the church musician .. for the Episcopalian and non-Episcopalian ... great reads ... you will laugh out loud! This is book two of 11 in the series ... you will want to read them all!!
4,Close to the Mitford books but not exactly,"I like the point of view that the author uses as the choirmaster organist and the chief of police. He also mentions either Jan Karon, Father Tim or the Lord's Chapel which gives both stories some authenticity. As a long-time Episcopalian I enjoy the personalities and the events that shape this church. I do not enjoy the silly ""detective"" stories. Most of them were confusing and difficult to follow which characters belonged to which story."
1,sour note,If I want to read a mystery then there should be significant amount of writing about the mystery in the book. This as his other books? is a case of a church gathering falling on a two paragraph mystery. And not a very good one at that. I rated this because I want a mystery to be a mystery not some meandering bable about something unrelated.
2,Not a Fan,"I won't completely trash this book because the author has received such rave reviews from Amazon readers, whose opinions I respect, so I figure it just must be me. I didn't mind the main character so much but felt everyone else was bland beyond belief (yes, even the dwarf). Within the story, we're subjected to excerpts from Hayden's attempt to write a mystery. I know it's supposed to be awful, everyone tells him so, but it was so awful I started to resent having to waste my time and money slogging through it, so I finally stopped. I finally finished the book, but only by starting to skip through about half way. I know this wasn't supposed to be a serious mystery. More of a slapstick cozy?"
2,MISSING,I wish my order wasn't cancelled. I don't know why. It would have been a nice touch to have a matching bowl.
3,Serving bowl,The bowl was actually smaller than I thought. It is a beautiful bowl and like all the other pieces in this Winterberry collection I have purchased the quality is second to none. A delightful addition.
1,"""Uncharted"" - depression","I had read one other of Angela Hunts' books and found it to be good, so I tried this one. It may be well written, but I'm so depressed I can't tell if it is or not. My biggest regret is finishing the entire book when I got so bogged down less than 1/2 way through."
1,Uncharted should have remained Unpublished,"I rarely say anything but the best about books I read but I feel that a warning to the wise is in order. What a terrible story. It is a play on a parable that Jesus told but there is nothing about this book that is uplifting, encouraging or hopeful. Hunt's presentation about how to avoid hell is not even good theology. It's Jesus or nothing and the author does not make that clear. What a waste of good money for so depressing a story. If you read it, don't say you haven't been warned (just like the characters in Uncharted)."
4,A very solid read that will stay with you for some time,"There was a couple of times where I felt a shock or realization as I read the story. This book will stay with you long after the last page is read and will really make you think about how you live your life - but more importantly how you are affecting and influencing others. Those who read this well written work of fiction will understand what I mean when I say ""I liked this book - but I didn't."""
2,dark and depressing,"I love Angela Hunt's books because they are all different. Unfortunately, I knew I was in trouble with this one when I read of Mark's favorite pastime. From there, things went from bad to worse. The book depressed me, possibly because it addresses the afterlife and I was just looking for a good inspirational read. I also had trouble understanding if Ms. Hunt was really trying to describe hell, purgatory, or was merely using poetic license to get readers to take stock of their relationship with God. If the latter is the case, she succeeded. However, I do think that any book that addresses such a dark issue needs to thoroughly counterbalance that darkness with the Hope we can have in Jesus Christ. Kudos to Angela Hunt for tackling all topics, but I will probably not recommend this book to any friends!"
2,"Blatant rip-off of TV Series ""Lost""","This book is a blatant rip-off of the TV series ""Lost,"" but lacks the creativity, character interest or complexity of the TV series. It is poorly written, repetitive (e.g., every character has the same exclamation of disgust, surprise, anguish, etc., i.e., ""good grief"")and the thin plot could be contained in far fewer than the 300 pages. Do not read this book if you are interested in a truly good mystery or intriguing and/or sympathetic characters."
2,Not what it appears to be . . . .,"A beautiful tropical island paradise on the cover, a tale of shipwreck, and allusions to the currently popular TV show ""Lost,"" and the movie ""Castaway."" All this might logically lead one to the conclusion that this is an amusing adventure novel, or even thriller.Be aware that this is not so. This book is actually blatant propaganda for the author's version of Christianity.Is there anything wrong with that? No. Does the book suck? No. Is it an amusing adventure novel? No.The cover, descriptions and even the author's bio all carefully contribute to the misleading facade of an amusing adventure novel, though.All's fair in the war to convert the heathens, apparently."
4,pretty good.,"Up to par with the usual Trance Party CDs.Some really good tracks, and some that are kind of boring.All in all, pretty good trance music.[and yes, the majority are about love..just like the majority of trance tracks, period.]"
5,A CLASSIC,"This cd is timeless- it still rocks today and never gets old.1.T.n T.- opening2.Dr. Feelgood-5 out of 5 stars3.Slice of your Pie-4 out of 5 stars4.Rattlesnake Shake-4 stars5.Kickstart my Heart-4.6 stars6.Without You- 5 out of 5 stars7.Same Ol' Situation-4.3 stars8.Sticky Sweet-3.9 stars9.She goes Down-3.9 stars10.Dont go away mad-4.8 stars11.Time For Change-4.4 starsOverall great cd , worth the money"
5,Their last good album.,"I always had a hard time deciding which Motley Crue album I liked better: this or GIRLS, GIRLS, GIRLS. They used to be one of my favorite bands. Their two releases since this album have been pretty disappointing. You have to go back to get the good stuff. This album is pure Crue. The powerful guitars, the slamming drum beats, and Vince Neil's vocals...all combine to turn this album into a rip roaring masterpiece of rock. DR. FEELGOOD, RATTLESNAKE SHAKE, and KICKSTART MY HEART will just blow you away. It also contains one of the best rock ballads of all time: WITHOUT YOU. A must have for any Crue fan."
5,Great Album!,My fiance has had this cd on his wishlist for a while and he's quite a music critic. He was pretty happy to get it for Christmas!
5,One of the Best 80s Album by one of the best 80s Band,"The last Classic Crue album and tied best along wit Shout at the Devil, this album is the epitomy of the 80s Spirit, and one of the best offerings of the Hair/Pop/Glam Metal Genre. Neil's high-pitched screech and Mick Mars' Guitar virtuosity are excellent, while the Rythm Section (Lee and Sixx) plays tight. This is the Sleazy 80s Image at its best!Best songs: Dr. Feelgood [9/10] Classic Hard-htting Rocker!, Kickstar My Heart [9/10] Fast Heavy Track, Without You [8/10] Awesome ballad, Times for Change [9/10] One of the best 80s Ballads ever."
1,Smell The Glove,"Two words: Spinal Tap. If you thought Spinal Tap was a real Heavy Metal band, this album is for you."
1,Uugh,"You gotta admit, these guys really bite. No musicianship, bad singing and songwriting. How this group became a huge success is truly beyond me."
2,Motley Crue - 'Dr.Feelgood' (Hip-O),"Nice job on this CD reissue,that is IF you originally liked this album when it first came out.I never did,I mean 'Dr.Feelgood' was just TOO commercial for me.Talk about a sell-out.Three tracks here I could never take,which were ""Don't Go Away Mad"",""Same 'Ol Situation"" and the title cut ""Dr.Feelgood"".However,all is not lost,there are six(6)bonus tracks tagged on,that I think I actually like.Those being demo takes of ""Dr.Feelgood"",""Without You"" and ""Kickstart My Heart"".Maybe there's hope yet."
4,Their Best,"This is their best album, with the most satisfying tracks over the album's duration. Key tracks are: Dr. Feelgood, Kickstart My Heart, Without You, Same Ol' Situation (S.O.S.) and Don't Go Away Mad (Just Go Away). I would recommend it even to non- Crue fans as a solid heavy metal album."
5,perfect thanks..,unopened perfect condition.. brings me back to the good ol days when i was young quick service and delvery thanks will buy from again..
5,It's the Same Ol' Situation...Motley Crue still rule!,"This is my favourite Crue album of all time, from the glam-tastic late 80s. The opening track kicks in with Sixx's thundering bassline, before ripping into the powerful, sexy song and catchy chorus. The tracks which follow are of equally high quality. Even the ballads are okay, and I hate ballads! The album really catches the excitement of the whole Glam scene, and many of the tracks are great to dance to! Compared to this band, most just pale into insignificance."
5,ONE OF THE BEST ROCK ALBUMS OF THE 80's,"Motley Crue never was, and have never been a consistent band. Their older albums were so-so (GIRLS GIRLS GIRLS is the exception), and their newer albums are nothing special. In general, most of Motley Crue's worthwhile material can be found on their greatest hits album. So what happened here? I have no idea, but whether by sheer musicianship, or complete luck, Motley Crue made a true classic here that eclipses all of their other work, and is, in my opinion, THE hair metal album to beat. Every song on this album is great, with the best being ""Dr Feelgood"", ""Same Ol Situation"", ""She Goes Down"", ""Rattlesnake Shake"", and one of the 80's best power ballads (beaten by Motley Crue's own ""Home Sweet Home"") ""Without You"". Therefore, what I'm saying is that ANY fan of hair metal needs to own this album, as it is the prime example of why that era rocked. The only thing that's sad about this album is Motley Crue never came close to matching it."
5,ravage24/7,"I am the biggest Motley Crue fan out there!This is without a doubt the Crues most complete work.You have the mega hits of Dr.Feelgood,Without You,S.O.S,and Kickstart my heart.Every other song on this cd is outstanding like Rattlesnake shake,and Sticky sweet.This by far is one of the greatest hard rock/metal cd's of all time hands down!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!So get your ass up and listen to some kick ass rocknroll!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Motley Crue Rules!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,An Ohio State Man is for an Ohio State Fan,"Great little book for all Ohio State fans. Uniquely written by an Ohio State fan who befriended long time Ohio State assistant football coach Esco Sarkkinen. Full of great little stories and insights into Ohio State football that I have not read in other Ohio State books. Great stories about Ohio State legend Woody Hayes. Short book, well written, makes for a quick read. I would deffinately recommend."
1,self tanner??,"This self tanner I thought would work for me. BUT it did not. I was careful to put it on,and yet it made me orange. Be careful"
2,Doesn't hold up,"I've owned this set for a year now & while I was thrilled at first, I am now disappointed. A year later, the pieces look ""pitted"" (for lack of a better word) and a few even seem to be rusting. I should have spent more for a higher quality set."
4,Great weight,"I found that the flatware was very nice designed and it has a pretty nice weight.The down side would be that it only has 2 serving utensils, two more would be nice to have."
4,"very interesting concept, a good read.",I was recomended this book and did not know what to expect. It is the author's ideas on armageddon/end of the world/new spiritual being. It painted a nice picture and gave some hope.... and was fun to read. I think you have to be quite spiritual get what the author was trying to say. I enjoyed it.
4,An inspiring story of love and transformation,"Judy Horky's EARTHSHIFT is an inspiring and heartwarming tale of a family's journey through profound changes. No matter your beliefs about the changing of the ages, this family's tragedies and triumphs are timeless and profound."
4,Very good grinder for little money,"This is great, does exactly what it's supposed to do. Very happy with the simplicity of operation and clean up is a breeze. The price was within my budget and although not top of the line, could not be happier. As usual, delivery fantastic and well ahead of time."
4,like it alot,good itemlike it alotsmall and light weightdoesn't take much counter space at allblades are sharpit does the job for a pot of coffee in a day for me n families
3,hands not free grinder,"I bought this grinder and was very happy first couple weeks. It was exactly what I wanted - hands free automatic coffee grinder. But my happiness lasted only couple weeks and after that it was not hands free anymore. From rattle and shake the locked top cover came loose and the grinder automatically stopped working. You have to keep the top cover with your hand in order it to be locked and the grinder to be working.Hamilton Beach 80365 Custom Grind Hands-Free Coffee Grinder, Platinum"
5,"""Great Ginder for My Morning Coffee"".","This grinder really is hands free and grinds my coffee beans just the way I want them ground every time. The price is the best I could find and so is the quality of this grinder, no problems."
4,Does the job,"I picked this up to go with my 3 cup espresso maker. I wanted to be able to get whole roasted beans and grind them up only when I need them. It does the job required and does it very quickly. My only complaint and this might be self inflicted in it measures for larger systems. I had to guess a couple of times to figure out the right amount for my 3 cup espresso maker, but one that was determined it does a great job."
4,I was wrong about this product,"I bought this product in early May. At first I thought it was great because I have arthritis and I didn't have to hold the grind button in for the whole grind.After 6 weeks I THOUGHT it was getting faulty and gave it a bad review in this space. I have since learned that it was my electric socket that was temperamental. I have changed where I plug in the grinder, and it is working as expected.I wish to take back my 'disappointed' review, and apologize if I misled a potential purchaser of this coffee grinder."
3,nice coffee grinder,"This product works well, but it can only ground small amounts of coffee at a time."
2,my hamilton beach coffee grinder,This coffee grinder worked fine for a while. Then it broke. Be careful when turning the plastic top so it will grind. It will break off.
5,COFFEE GRINDER,"Awesome unit. We had this exact grinder for years, but it quit working, but it grinds wonderfully, has many different settings, has a built in brush for cleaning, and a cord saver. Very complete unit."
3,Takes simple task and makes it complicated!,"First, this unit is much smaller than it looks in the photo, they must have found a 4'10"" model to hold it for the product shot. The result is that the grinding bin is so small that I can barely get enough beans in it to make a 4 cup French press, I don't know where they got the idea this thing could grind enough beans for 12 cups as indicated on the vertical selector. Second, I thought I could pulse the grind if I wanted to instead of using the automated grind selector but no, once you press the grind button it grinds extremely fast automatically and by the time you press a second time to stop it you might have over ground the coffee. I suppose if you are going to use it for grinding herbs and spices as much as for coffee then it might have some value but if you are looking for simple coffee been grinder, skip this model."
5,Great Coarse Grinds For My French Press,My wife loves Jamician coffee and brings it home every year when we go on vacation so we needed a grinder. We use a French Press so we needed a grinder that made gave us coarse grinds which the Hamilton does. There was some trial in error on how many beans vs how many cups to get it right but this was a quick learning process. We have had the Hamilton for a year and use twice a week with no problems and easy to clean. We liked it so much that we gave it as a gift where it gets daily use and it has not had a problem yet. I have nothing to compare it to but I can say that it is easy to use easy to clean and very durable.
3,hold on!,"The motor in this grinder is so good that it rattles the top out of the lock position, so you need to hold it down while in operation. Not the intended useage. I purchased for a disabled person, bummer."
2,Sub standard,No matter what grind you choose it grinds the same...totally stupid. Look elsewhere. Get yourself a mortar and pestle. You're welcome
1,Disappointed as well,I bought this grinder 3 months go and it's dead as of today - it does not work any more! Am buying today another grinder but not Hamilton Beach for sure.
2,Caught on fire. 'Nuff said.,"Bought it on sale, brand new. Used it about 3-4 times and saw smoke come out and it was done."
1,defective,"This item was exactly what I wanted: a hands-free coffee grinder, one that I could preset to a grind time, press the button, and then leave it there to buzz the beans while I got the coffee maker ready. It did not grind the beans and then it never fired up again. The design seems very good but I was not interested in exchanging for another, just had a bad feeling about it."
4,HB Coffee Grinder,This HB Coffee Grinder does a Terrific Job! I wish that there was a way for it to tell you how much coffee beans you need to grind though. It is very noisy too but it does a Great Job! Thank You Amazon and Hamilton Beach!!! ;0)
2,Grinder,As this is mt first grinder I have nothing to compare it with .It does have a wind up cord. the one I bought first had a 4 inch cord and wouldn't reach my outlets.All of the grinds are the same except for the largest .This is the one use In my 1 cup. drip pot. I wouldn't buy it again. Unless the others are worse if I ever have to buy another
1,Save your money. Short life-span.,"Product works great initially, then as others have stated it stops working without warning for no apparent reason. The blades also dull very quickly giving an uneven grind in the end. Note that I have only owned this product for four months and it is already unusable. It simply stopped working completely.Save your money buy a better grinder."
4,Love this grinder!,"Would have five starred this beauty, just to soon due to lack of a lot of use. A lot nicer than the grinder we previously used, quieter, easier to clean, and good options for grinding."
2,Not worth it,"I bought this as a replacement for my Cuisinart grinder...that grinder was so much better!! It lasted several years, whereas this lasted just a few months. It was so disappointing. One day it just stopped. I did like the timer feature, but that was about it."
1,Very Disappointed,"I purchased this grinder and paid more thinking that it would be better. Boy, was I wrong. It did not grind evenly and now doesn't even work after having only used it three times. I had a less expensive one before and got so much use out of it."
1,What a Piece of Junk,The little plastic locking nub broke the first time it was used. What a total waste of money.
2,Quite happy with it . . . until it died,"I bought this one month ago and kept telling myself that I'd like to write a good review on it. I was pretty happy with the design and the variable pre-set grinding times. Plus, it was easy to remove the cup and empty the grounds--a feature that I found more appealing than the setup on my ancient Krups grinder. However, yesterday, it just stopped working. I tried cleaning it carefully and making sure the top fit tightly. But, no luck. Luckily, my good ol' Krups was waiting patiently in the wings and came to the rescue.The grinder was relatively inexpensive so I don't think it's worth the time and effort to put up a fuss and get it replaced. I'll just stick with the Krups. It works fine after 15+ years. I just thought it was time for a change. Lesson learned. (If it ain't broke, . . . don't replace it.)"
1,Dead,"The first one of these I bought was dead when I opened the box. I thought it was a fluke, so I took it back to the store and got another one. This one worked, and I liked the little features like the brush & the winding cord. But every now and again it would just stop working. I thought it was the extension cord I had it connected to (my kitchen has really inconvenient plug locations.) So I tried many different combinations & locations in my kitchen, and it would still just not work. Eventually it would start again, but now, after only about a year of use, it's officially dead. I used to have a little Krupps and it worked fine for years. I would advise against this coffee grinder."
1,Dud,I have just received this grinder. After setting it up we turned it on and off it went - without pushing the on /off button. Did an OK job of grinding. Decided to make another pot of coffee so switched on our new grinder. No reaction at all. Dead. No sign of life. Complete waste of money. I would not recommend this product to anyone and I am extremely upset.
2,"Works fine, but not durable at all","I actually have no issues with this cheap grinder when it works. I have now owned two of them and they both lasted about a year. $20 isn't a lot of money, but I will not be buying another one."
2,Prone to fatal overheating,"I bought this to grind things other than coffee, namely flaxseed and spices. Flaxseed, it did a fine job with. Nutmeg, however, killed this unit. Granted, nutmeg isn't really an appropriate thing to put into a coffee grinder. I know that now. However, after running multiple cycles consecutively (during which the blade did a fine job obliterating the nutmeg), it began to smell like burning. Then black smoke began wafting out of the unit. Rather than risk a full-blown electrical fire, I retired the unit. I guess I shouldn't expect too much from a $20 appliance, but I would hope for a ""don't obliterate your insides"" safety cutoff.Was also hard to clean flaxseeds. They were stubborn on the rubber surface with the included brush, and did not release fully in the dishwasher."
3,"Decent machine for blade grinder, but watch out for flimsy plastic","For what this is and its price, it has a lot going for it. If you are a real coffee aficionado, you should probably move on to a much higher priced burr grinder or the like. But for a blade grinder, this one does a good job and is not too noisy. The hands-free function is very convenient, just press start and let it work to your settings for desired grind and number of cups. All that said though, watch out for the flimsy plastic on the grinding cover. There are two ""teeth"" on it that slip into place as a safety interlock function. After about four months of daily use, one of these has broken off and operation is now sketchy at best. I have not abused this item, just used it. I am currently contacting Hamilton Beach about warranty service, so I will update with the results."
3,This lot stinks!,"I purchased this same item for my daughter and it worked beautifully! Definitely waterproof, no leaks and functioned great. After returning home I wanted one for myself and ordered it from Amazon. Not only did it not work properly, it leaked! I returned it and received a replacement. It worked fine. That was great, but alas, it also leaked! So I have returned it also and will not purchase it online again."
5,Great Grinder,This is a good little grinder I use for coffee but may be used with spices too. It has great features like settings for coarseness of grind and number of cups. It is quieter than other grinders of the same size. This is a replacement for the same model which initially failed after two years. I was able to repair it by by resoldering a broken power resistor lead. After another repair of the power resistor lead the resistor finally failed (it wasn't marked) and I decided to replace the unit.
2,"Great Features, Now If It Would Only Turn On",Features are great but after 3 months it died. Apparently this company does not understand that people grind more than a cup at a time. Highly disappointing!
1,Didn't last very long,Save your twenty dollars and spend a few more for something that will last. This only worked for about a year. MADE IN CHINA=Doesn't last.
2,Nice design spoiled by cheap plastic,This is a nice product while it lasts. Made with super cheap delicate plastic and it will easily break if dropped once. The capacity is very little as compared to others not at all useful.at this price point there are better options imo
3,Still has the same flaw as earlier models,I was hopin the change in model number meant they had fixed the fatal flaw...the lock mechaism gets dust in it and then you have to fight to make the beast work until it dies....Try to find the newer model that has this problem fixed
1,2 grinders with short lifespans,"Just bought this grinder again, less than a month ago, to replace the same brand/model. The previous grinder lasted about 3 months before the hands-free function stopped working, the grinder itself completely stopped working after 2 years. I liked the price,the evenness and fineness of the grinder so I bought the same grinder again. The new grinder just stopped working in the middle of grinding about 2T of beans. This grinder gets used almost daily but only for small amounts of coffee beans (usually just enough for a cup of coffee). Due to the short life of these 2 grinders I cannot recommend this grinder."
2,works well for 9 months to a year,"I bought this product about a year ago; it has stopped working. I don't know if it's the little safety latch that has malfunctioned, or the on button. The lesson, at least to me, is to not trust little electronic buttons on coffee grinders! My mother has had a coffee grinder for 30 years, and the damn thing still works great. I don't know what brand it is, because any identifying marks wore off years ago.Come on, Hamilton Beech, how hard is it to build a hight quality coffee grinder???"
1,Unevenly grinds beans,"This grinder does not work well if you use a French press to make coffee. It grinds the beans very unevenly - some large pieces and some very fine dust, even on the ""Percolator"" (coarsest) setting. When you brew the coffee the fine dust goes right through the metal filter and ends up in your cup.On the plus side, it is easy to clean and maintain. It may work fine if you use paper filters."
5,Very nice coffee/spice grinder,"I bought this grinder a couple of years ago, and have been very pleased with it. For some reason, one could no longer purchase Braun products in the U.S., so when my little Braun grinder finally gave out after about 15 years, I couldn't replace it. So I bought another grinder, which lasted about a year. Then another, also about a year. I have mixed feelings about the quality of HB products, but liked the features this one offered, so I bought it.Here is what I like best about it:1) Hands-free grinding - no need to stand and hold the button down.2) The removable container. It makes cleanup quick and simple.3) The ability to set the grind size (percolator, drip, espresso)and quantity (# cups). I have found consistency in its grinds.4) The power cord stores very neatly in the base, which pulls open to easily unwind and rewind the cord.As I said, so far, so good. I would definitely replace it with another if it should go."
1,Don't Buy This!!!!,Just a word of warning. I used this less than 30 days and it died. I bought this one because i had another Hamilton Beach that lasted over 15 years. Apparently quality control has diminished. Don't waste your time.
1,Custom Grind fell apart after two years of mild use,"I purchased the 80355 model of this product and after two years of weekend use it basically fell apart. The motor was only mounted with double stick tape and the plastic snaps that attach the silver housing to the black grinding bowl. The tape came loose from the motor and then the motor and grinding bowl eventually worked their way out of the housing. Otherwise it worked well, but a product such as this should last a lot longer than two years, especially since I was only using it on the weekends. I have another grinder that I spent $10 on about 10 years ago that still works.When I contacted Hamilton Beach they said that since it was out of the 1 year warranty they couldn't do anything. I will never buy a Hamilton Beach product again and recommend that you don't either."
1,Not Built well,This Item looks good BUT Beware! It smoked and smelled and got hot on the third use!!
2,great while it lasted...,"This coffee grinder made great coffee...for a while. After two years, it started acting up and now does not work at all. Quite a shock the day I went to make my coffee and couldn't! Ended up using my food processor for my beans that day...yech."
3,Great while it lasted.,"This was a great little grinder until it simply stopped working one day, after only about 2 months. It's possible I just got a dud; I have other Hamilton Beach products and haven't had really any problems. Still, because of the extremely short lifespan for this particular purchase, I can't in good conscience recommend it to anyone. Ironically, after this one failed, I ended up buyingCuisinart DCG-12BC Grind Central Coffee Grinder, which has far worse reviews, but it's been a trooper for me. I grind with it pretty regularly and it still works like it just came out of the box."
3,not happy,I have used this only about once a week to grind coffee for the whole week and after about six months the button got messed up so i have had to rig it up to use it. I have had other hamilton beach products that last but not recommending this one.
1,Apparently you get what you pay for,"I purchased this grinder two years back since the bowl was supposedly top-rack dishwasher safe. About 5 months after I bought it, the plastic portion of the bowl cracked. This didn't stop my use of the grinder since it didn't leak grounds, it was just annoying.But, over the past month, the lid - also plastic - has worn down and won't lock into place. This causes you to have to have a tight grip on the unit so that it will work. I wish I'd searched for a hgher-quality one from the get-go. Not at all satisfied."
5,Terrific,We needed a coffee grinder and this one is great. I can grind enough coffee beans for one pot or do enough to last several days and store them in a container.
3,Went through two of them in five years.,"Satisfaction depends on how long you expect a grinder to last. We brew daily in a percolator and grind each time prior to brewing. I've purchased two of these in the past five years. Both just (burnt out?) suddenly stopped working. I, personally, expect an appliance to last a little longer that this particular grinder has for us. I won't be buying this model again. As far as it being ""hands-free"" - that was never the case for us. If you let the top of the grinder go, it will come ""unlocked"" and will stop grinding."
5,Really great product,"We've had our grinder for about three years, and use it mercilessly: two to three pots a day, sometimes more. It has finally gotten to the point where it's no longer 'hands free' so I'm going to buy another one just like it. It's easy to use, and you can grind your coffee and get it from the grinder into the filter without making a huge mess on the counter. None of the other grinders we've owned had a big enough top for that. Either that, or they had an annoying drawer-type holder that inevitably left a trail of coffee on the counter."
1,I got a Lemon,"The grinder worked great for 46 days, after that the unit stopped working. It completely went dead. Since the order was over 30 days, Amazon would only give a partial refund. It's a $20 dollar item. I'm not going to jump through the hoops for that. When it did work it was great. I'll probably order another one later after I cool down (maybe)."
3,"Bought two, one died in less than a year","I've owned two, both less than a year old. The one at home works like a champ (and I really like it), but the one at work just died for no reason. I took it apart, cleaned and examined it, couldn't see anything wrong. Still doesn't work. It had ""stopped"" working a few times, so I would adjust the cord (unplugged, etc) and it would start working again. Reliability is a hit/miss I'm guessing.I do like it though. The coarse setting is great for my french press, and the finest section does well for my espresso machine. Works well and is affordable.But I'm torn whether I'll replace it with the same thing. Hard to spend money on something you like, but not sure will work."
5,Perfect home coffee grinder,"I ordered this grinder new. Before I ordered it, I read some good and some bad reviews. Decided the good reviews outweighed the bad ones. Glad I made that decision. It's a magnificent kitchen tool. I cannot find anything to complain about. It works perfectly and really is hands-free. Easy to clean and simple to operate."
1,"AFTER SEVERAL MONTH, IT DOESN'T WORK!","This coffee grinder is a waste of money. At first it works fine, but after couple months later, I need to push down very hard and even hit the top to make it work. Now it totally die just 6 months after I bought it. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS PRODUCT. I got one KRUPS coffee grinder which is much cheaper than the price of HAMILTON BEACH ONE at target."
1,Another piece of junk!!!,"Another piece of junk!!! I've only had this thing for 3 months and it will not turn on anymore. For what little I used it, you would think that I would get at least a years worth of use out of it. Unless you plan on replacing your coffee grinder every few months, don't waste your money. This product gets a ""0"" from me"
3,Loved it until it broke 2 weeks later,"Warning on this one: Keep your amazon receipt.We bought this as a replacement to the older model which had lasted several years. We like the hands-free design. This version has less capacity than the old model, but is much quieter and grinds perfectly first time through. Unfortunately, two weeks later the grinder blade just broke off. Hopefully the replacement will fare better, otherwise, will have to drop the rating to one star."
1,Unreliable,"First thing in the morning, while I'm still waking up and maybe a tad groggy, the last thing I want is a finicky coffee grinder. I bought this coffee grinder and used it daily for a few months, when it started working only some of the time. Some days it would work righty off the bat, and other days it had to be disassembled and cleaned and reassembled, usually 2 or 3 times... unplugging it every time for safety. This added annoying minutes to the process of getting the first cup of coffee in the morning. It got to be so annoying that I put the grinder away in the cabinet and bought a bag of pre-ground coffee. When that ran out, the coffee grinder came out of the cabinet again, and this time it didn't work regardless of how many times it was cleaned and disassembled. Now I'm in the market for a new coffee grinder."
5,Perfect little grinder,"Don't know what this little guy could do better. It's an attractive black and silver that looks right at home with the rest of my appliances, it's small and easily portable, has adjustable grind settings, and comes apart for easy cleaning. One-touch means you can put the coffee in it and start grinding while you get everything else ready - no more holding it down while you wait.The cord spools into the base, so if you're on the road it's easy to bring with.Everything I needed in a grinder, nothing I don't."
1,Fire Hazard,"I was given this as a gift and the very first time I used it, it started smoking from the base. I had to toss it out the window into the snow to prevent my kitchen from catching fire. What a waste of good coffee!"
1,Useless junk,"I bought this to use for coffee and continued to use my old Krups grinder for spices. The Krups grinder has finally failed, after 30 years; this piece of trash died after @ 8 months. The top will no longer stay tightly closed, so it doesn't grind at all, after a couple of months where the grind was very inconsistent and a lot of partial beans were ending up in the mix. I would strongly advise against wasting money on this appliance. I'm going back for another Krups."
2,Works fine until it breaks,"I liked this grinder very much when we bought it. The hands-free feature was great, but it stopped working a few months after we bought it. Now, after about a year of service, it has stopped working completely. My old Braun had worked for about 10 years. I won't buy this grinder again."
3,Great while it lasted.,"Great grinder but only if you expect to get one years worth of use. Used daily for almost one year with normal coffee beans before it died. The blade stayed sharp and the little machine worked hard, but I really had hoped for its price it would have had a longer life. I am going back to my black and decker which is still alive and well. No more hamilton beach products for me. Our coffee maker was great too, but that died after less than 15 months too. Wondering if hamilton beach is just not up to its competition regarding its durability and life span. Time to find out as I am done with this company. Not bad, just not excellent!"
3,"Love it, but it broke","Out of all the coffee grinders I've tried, this was my favorite, mostly because you don't have to stand there and hold a button down. It ground consistently and perfectly for a year. But now it's dead. This was used daily (sometimes twice a day) during that period. It's since been replaced by an inferior grinder (which I'm planning on returning because of its poor quality) b/c I just can't force myself to buy something that won't last."
2,Died After a Few Months of Use,"This grinder was great... until it died. I appreciated the handy cord storage, the nearly hands-free operation, the removable grinding chamber, and the hidden brush for easy cleaning. For those features, I'll bump it up from one star.However, it pooped out on us after about three months of approximately weekly use for grinding spices. It was working fine until, one day, it simply wouldn't turn on. No amount of cord-jiggling, lid adjusting, or creative button-pressing would revive it. After 10-20 uses? Inexcusable.I'm going to take this back to the store of purchase for a return or exchange. If I had it to do over again, I would save my money and spend a little extra for a more durable machine."
1,Junk,The bottom came off this thing before I used it the first time. I did not save the box it came in before I tried to use it
5,Works just like it should,I have been using it for a few months now. Works just like advertised. Produces consistent grounds at each setting.
4,Great little grinder,"This is my second hamilton beach coffee grinder. I bought both because they were the only ones I could find that actually let you select the grind. I drink espresso, and this is the only grinder (countertop type) I have found to do this and do it well. The only reason I had to replace it was the first model I had, the plastic part on the lid that locks it in place wore out. The motor was still fine. I actually replaced that lid once from the company. This newer model is still plastic but the connection/lock is bigger and bolder and will probably last a little longer. This new one is so easy to wash as well, the whole grinder separates easily from the motor. I would happily pay a higher price for the same grinder made with metal instead of plastic. Too bad everything is so ""disposable"" in this day and age. And as far as coffee grinders go, this one is relatively quiet."
5,GREAT Coffee Grinder,"I love the design of this grinder! It's easy to use and grinds coffee perfectly. I like my coffee uber strong so I always use the most fine grind setting. I liked mine so much that I'm buying this one as a gift for a family member. It's relatively quiet as far as grinders go (no electric grinder is truly quiet, frankly), but that's all relative."
3,not very hands free,"the grinder is decent but it seems to aut shut off if you let go of it--not sure if its improperly balanced or what. So I end up steadying it by the lid while it grinds. That said, you can adjust the grinder for how many servings worth of beans and, if you hold the lid, it turns off automatically with the beans properly ground, no guess work involved."
5,Automatic shut off is fantastic,"No guessing - set it to the grind you need, it grinds and then turns off automatically! Perfect. I have had other grinders and they grind inconsistently, but this one works great."
5,"Reliable, simple to use","I have owned two of these now. The first one lasted me several years before I wore it out (I do not think it was defective as I got plenty of use out of it). I like the ease of use, the simple features. I like the added feature of the little brush (which clips on the back) for brushing out the finer grounds. For easy washing you can separate the grinding cup and lid from the base.In looking to replace my first one of these I shopped around at other models and almost all of them in the same price range and many that cost a lot more had one design feature that I find to be quite discouraging. The others depend on some small piece of plastic protrusion sticking out from the cap or up from the base to engage the switch; something that will DEFINITELY wear out and break off after use. I like the solid, reliable switch on this Hamilton Beach grinder so I am sticking with it."
2,French Press users BEWARE,"This unit replaced my ""GE hands free coffee grinder"" that went belly up after 2 yrs.Great unit but could not find one like it to reorder.After 2 hrs worth of reviews-decided on the Hamilton Beach 80365 Custom Grind-First use= lowest cup setting is ""4"". Options: PERC- DRIP- ESPRESSO. No setting for French Press.I used the ""4 cup"" & lowest percolate setting hoping to get some course grinds for my press.Results: Some grind/ majority whole beans.Tried grinding again and still have the whole beans in it only smaller amounts.Went on and used the grind in my press.End result was coffee colored water & Starbucks on the way to work.What a way to start the day!"
1,Stopped working after 5 uses,"I knew was buying a cheap grinder, but I expected it to work more than 5 times. It literally just stopped turning on. Words of warning, this product is cheaply made."
2,"Chopper, not a Grinder","This is a coffee chopper (blade); not a grinder (burr). I can chop coffee in my blender. Returned item without testing it. Might be a great product for quick chopping of coffee, but not for grinding $40 a pound beans. I Ordered a BURR Grinder to replace it. Item arrived in pieces, possible though UPS mishandling in the bonus day they spent delivering the item. It did not appear to be packaged to Amazon's high standards."
1,Inconsistent grind = terrible grinder,"The problem with this grinder is that it leaves some beans barely ground and others too finely ground. I like how it closes and that you can fit a lot of beans into it, but the fact that the grind is so inconsistent makes it an undesirable product. I think I would only recommend it to someone who only wants the finest grind, and even then they'll be spending more time than they should to achieve it."
1,Bought this grinder with great expectations.,"It was supposed to do all the things my old grinder did and more. I took it out of the box and ........... nothing. It didn't ever work, period. Very disappointing. Is there a rating lower than one star. If there was, I would use it."
1,SAVE YOUR MONEY,"Sitting Bull / Cry Blood Apache - 2 DVD Collector's Edition Embossed TinThis is not a review of the cast of characters, storylines or any of the like; BE AWARE THAT THE TWO CDS JUST DO NOT PLAY....YOU CAN'T PLAY THEM YOU CAN'T RATE THEM.(One star is being quite generous!!)EIH"
4,Late night music for a summer evening,"This recording sounds like some great lost 60s album recorded by the Pentangle or the Jefferson Airplane. Psychedelic noodling and sound effects mix effectively with sleepy vocals and randomly strummed acoustic guitar. The production even has an overlay of hiss, making it sound even more like that worn-out record album of yesteryear.Compelling, gorgeous, and sounding like a sonic capsule from that greatest of all musical eras."
3,This game is cute but gets boring rather quickly,"I played this game for hours on end after I first bought it but got soon bored with having to start the same level over and over and over again because the trolls spotted Bilbo or he didn't have enough health to survive a massive troll attack. Downloading a trainer and cheat codes helped for a while, but now I'm getting bored again (I'm stuck in Mirkwood, getting slaughtered by skeletal warriors in spite of The Ring).The game action mainly consists of jumping/climbing, picking up things, and wacking baddies.It's an ok game for relaxation after a long work day and I'll continue playing it, mainly because I like the graphics. My only real criticism is that you can't change the camera angle to 1st viewer perspective (looking at Bilbo's back gets a bit annoying after a while) and that sometimes the view changes by itself (for example in the dwarf mines when Bilbo has to jump from one big wheel to the next), making it hard to control his movements."
3,"Entertaining, but more of a kids game","I've played this game a long time ago, but I still enjoy it. The 'plot' of the game stay close to the story line of the book, but has a bit of a 'cartoony' characters and the way some move.Still a bit challenging, but not too hard, at least at the beginning. I'm only a short way into the game, but I do remember it gets harder.A good family game."
3,Good game - but does not work with Windows 7 64 bit,"This was a gift intended to replace one that was lost - and thought it loaded and began, it will not work on Windows 7 64 bit, and there is no ""fix"" available to make it do so."
4,Based on DEMO,"This is not a ""hard-core"" gamers dream by any means, but the demo was a lot of fun and I will buy the game based on that. There is a lot of jumping which needs to be done in a synchronized and timed manner and it appears that you can only save at certain points, but there seems to be a lot to explore and some challenges in getting all of the ""courage points."""
3,"nice to play, very foolish control","The title for this review says it all. the camera view in certain scenes is so stupid it's ridiculous. you end up dying so many times simply because of the camera view and the controls. i am sorry i bought this game for i simply don't think that making the controls & camera view difficult to handle is the way to justify making a game challenging. I stop playing at the dragon level for this was a true irritation to me.I truly like the many colors in this game, it made the actual experience more fun, but the over all graphics is definitely so-so. The story is nice however, and so was the audio.All in all this is a 6.5 out 10 game in my opinion along with many gaming sites.it's a nice game if you can tolerate it's draw backs."
4,Hobbit Fan's Review,If you are a fan of the Book you will enjoy this game. I am new to the whole gamer phenom and I am sure there are way more advanced games on the market but I am enjoying graphics and the over all storyline mirrors the book very well.
4,The Hobbit is Awesome!,It was really challenging to win it. Another great part was that it wasn't one of those games that you beat in a day and you really have to use your head to win it. I had a great time beating it. Also the levels are awesome because they are very creative and hard to figure out. It's an awesome game and I would recommend it to anybody that is a gamer.
1,hated it!,"Perhaps it's because I had just finished ""Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"" and was looking for more of the same...but I hated this game.First I had to install and uninstall it three times to get it to work. That alone was terribly annoying. My system is NOT ancient, but this was ridiculous.I will admit that I didn't get very far into it. I got immediately bored picking up jewels on the road. I disliked my character's movement. I disliked the environment and what you have to do to move ahead.I'm not an expert gamer, but this was too much work for so little fun. If I have to sweat, sure would like some decent results.My advice? Buy Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, instead."
4,30's Girls Night Out and Hanging with the Boys,"This is the ideal book of love,lust and friendship in the 30 year age bracket. The choices that are made, hearts that are broken and the bonds that are built. A very well written and fast paced book that most can identify with.[...]"
3,"good for sore thighs, though","based on the picture, i had hoped that these would extend onto my lower back--nope."
3,Sizing is way off,"These shorts are way oversized. A large, by their description, would be more like an extra large by my description. I needed a large by their description, but in reality, I should have ordered their Medium. (I have a 38 inch waist and their large is too large).Just be aware, whatever sizing they display, choose the next size smaller, and you will most likely come out OK. Otherwise, you might find yourself with some unintentional ""overexposure"" issues. :)"
1,Made for pygmy's,"I threw my money away buying these shorts. Since they're made in a 3rd world country where most the people are starving and have size 24"" waists, their version of an XL is really a medium or small. If you buy these shorts, make sure you buy them two sizes (not one) bigger. As for me, I figure they lied in their description and it caused me a hassle plus money, so I'm not buying from them anymore."
5,Hot Tasty Blues,"I think it did him good to live in Europe as long as he did . It kept him Blusier than most . His renditions are estupendous , you can tell he loved playing and entertaining for the fun of it . A well kept secret that is slowly comming out . Love It ..."
5,Peaceful - beautiful - haunting,"I first heard Dean play the glass armonica at a candlelight concert at Colonial Williamsburg. It was the most beautiful thing I have ever heard - especially with the acoustics provided by the intimate setting of the chamber in the Capitol building. When he announced at the end of the concert that he was releasing a Christmas CD, I went to the Colonial Williamsburg gift shop to see if I could order it by mail when it came out. (There was no online shopping in 1994). I ordered a CD for myself and a few extra to give as gifts that year.This CD still continues to be one of my favorite Christmas CDs. There are no vocals - just beautiful melodies created by the glass armonica, accompanied occasionally by a harp, violin or piano."
1,Never received it!,"Never received this item. Wasn't charged for it, but was never notified it wasn't coming! From now on, that vendor's out."
2,Pflatzgraff Isn't What It Once Was,"I bought the Winterberry dishes two years ago and was not thrilled with Pfaltzgraff's quality. It's gone down hill since then; the creamer and sugar were different colors - the creamer is white and the sugar is cream colored. Additionally, the green band on the creamer is rough and chipped. I'd have returned these to Amazon, but needed them for a party. I'd recommend purchasing something other than Pfaltzgraff."
3,An Important Book Falls Short,"Mr. Piotrowski has written an important book on a little-known subject. Great many Poles had perished during and after WWII in Poland's eastern territories at the hands of the Red Army and the Soviet Union. However, Poland's conflict with Ukrainians is a different matter, and must be seen in the context of the Ukrainian struggle for independence - against Polish colonialism - in western Ukraine. Centuries of Polish oppression against the Ukrainian people come to an end during this period at a great cost to both Ukrainians and Poles."
3,They may have jumped the shark,"My whole family have been fans of this show since the first episode, but this season has let us down a bit. They've lost the larger story arc and are dipping into wholesale social commentary."
4,Long term Leverage fan...,"It might be a little more inconsistent, but I still love the characters. And I especially love the evolution of their relationships."
4,Satisfying wrap to the series,"I enjoyed this season, and particularly the maturing of the relationships. The finale was as good as you get for series TV. My main complaint is that the episodes had stopped being able to surprise me. After 4 years of being in on the scams, I could predict what was going to happen very early on. That said, it was a good time to wrap it up and they wrapped it well."
5,I want to say Thank You to the Cast & Crew of Leverage,"Thank you for a series that was funny, irreverent and entertaining for 5 seasons. I will miss it the same way I miss reading new Calvin & Hobbes comics - grateful I had 5 seasons to enjoy the show and ever hopeful the creators and cast will change their minds and do it again.This series is well written and well acted. I highly recommend it to anyone who likes seeing bad people pay for the crimes they commit.The last show had a lot of call backs to the first show which I really enjoyed.It is DVD worthy and I urge you not to take my word but watch it and see for your self.Thank you again Dean, Tim, Gina, Aldis, Christian and Beth.I look forward to seeing what you all do next."
5,An Issue I've Taken Up,"I like Leverage, every episode is fun, though it occasionally tries to hard, and it misses its mark, it's only ever by a little, and it can still be entertaining, fun, and a lovely modern day Robin Hood type tail. The issue with Cheerleading is a topic I've followed and started petitions for online at points after a friend got injured doing it. This episode was both hilarious and great fun that really captured the dysfunction of politics and showed a real issue. Though I think government would be a lot harder to hack.This was still great fun and I enjoyed it a lot.Leverage does it well every week it's on, this show was no exception.Clarence Oliver Author of The Three Diets Solution and The Path To Mindful Eating."
3,Not quite up to Leverage standards,"While this episode definitely had its moments, in general I don't think it was up to the standard of Leverage's best episodes in which the humor is witty and smart and is balanced with a few nice, serious moments. The hijinks and humor just got a bit too broad on this one. While I enjoyed the Star Trek homage in various spots including Willie Riker, a lot of the episode kind of felt over the top. Love Leverage so I can easily forgive a few missteps here and there."
5,Excellent show,This show has just the right amount of lightness and intelligence you crave. The characters are great actors that really entertain you and give you a good connection to their characters. The balance of the personalities and the plot is a tribute to the show writers. You never come away with the feeling of sadness or just general offness. It projects a feeling of contentment.
5,It keeps getting better!,"I've fallen in love with Leverage. Smart, well written, entertaining shows for TV are few and far between but Leverage definitly falls into that category. It has been great watching the characters develop over the last 4 years and this fifth season continues to entertain us with wonderful cons and develop complex characters who come together, with all their hangups, quirks, tragedies, strengths and weakensses, to form a team that will have you laughing and crying at the same time. Nate, Sophie, Elliot, Hardison, and Parker bring their own uniqueness and skills to make one of the most pleasant hours on TV. TNT has done itself proud and hopefully will continue by renewing for another season. If you are looking for a series to get emotionally involved with then Leverage is the show for you. Try it. You'll be glad you did."
5,"Good, needs more 'bad guy' development","I'm a huge fan of leverage personally and I have only ever not liked one episode. This one was set up pretty well and I enjoyed the episode but one of the things I felt it missed was a true bad guy, or at least more development into one. Still good episode, just needs more bad guy development, such as our guest that the reader understands or a discussion on an 'evil' ideal he stands for, etc."
5,the series keeps getting better,I love Leverage it's a smart series the interaction of the team has only improved. The writing has improved and the Cons are imaginative and suprizing. always fun to try to figure out the actual con during the show and usually have a few twists you didn't account for.
4,Poor Eliot :),This whole episode had me giggling. Eliot and Alec in Lucille singing the chase song was the highlight of the whole thing. This show gets better with every season! I hope it's around for many more.
3,There were better seasons,"At the beginning of this season I realized I was watching the show because I had seen the previous seasons and I wanted to finish it out, but not because this last season had many compelling story arcs or much character development. The weekly victims of injustice were passed over so quickly that they were almost not even peripheral, nor did they engender much sympathy. The series finale, which showed how great of an actor Timothy Hutton is, should have been more of a standard for other episodes, but it came too late in the process to save the show."
4,well-written romance,"I enjoyed reading The Sinner, another well-written romance by Madeline Hunter. This could easily have been 5 stars, as I really laughed at some of Dante's quips and loved the way his friends stood up for him. But Fleur persisted in acting so stubbornly stupid, acting against her own best interests, that at one point I began to wonder if she really was crazy, as her step-father portrayed her to be. I needed a better explanation for her stupidity than that provided in the story. Anyway, despite Fleur's idiocy, it was a good read, and overall, better than most."
1,I hate Fleur,"I had to put the book down when I learned the reason behind her fear of intimacy. Because she seen a birth when she was young and two friends died during child birth. Are you kidding me?? That is not a valid reason and makes her seem overly dramatic and childish. She should be embarassed by her ignorance. Then the way she trusts Siddel and blatantly ignores her husbands warning. And furthermore she does nothing to halt the rumors. In fact, she feeds oil to the fire by continuing her walks alone and having a jealous fit at her re-entry into society. She had no right to react that way when she made the marriage white because of her childish fear. Uggghhhhhhhhhh!!! i hate her so much I can't even finish the book."
4,the sinner,i thought the sinner was very good .i like how it brought all the others people from the whole series together .enjoy
3,One biiiiig thing to add about this book...,"Others have done a fine job reviewing this book (except for the one reviewer who got several specific and key elements wrong), but I just have to comment on it.I have not read other Madeline Hunter novels. I've been looking for a new series and picked up this book used when the blurb on the back piqued my interest. I enjoyed it for the most part. It was kinda cute, kinda predictable, somewhat sweet... but OH MY.""The desire deepened, went lower. It filled her hips and made her vulva cry.""WHAT??? I'm not sure I'll be able to read another of her books solely because of that paragraph! How on earth can I ever take her seriously as an author when I've got THAT line running through my head???? Did no one else find this as absurd as I did???I'll have to mull over reading anything else by her. My husband wants to forbid me to merely out of principle, but I probably won't listen -- just like Fleur, I'll ignore anything he says even if it IS for my own protection."
3,Forgettable I think,"To be honest, I'm not sure I liked this book. I love Madeline Hunter's books and I confess that this is the first one of which I was unsure. The story is good enough, the characters just as amenable, but I suppose that I expected more suspense in this one, similar to her other books. Fleur is not exactly a very likable character. She irritated me at times but predictably redeems herself in the end. Dante is as good a hero as any. He accommodates her to the best of his ability and even strains at his limits at times to abide with Fleur's wishes. I don't know. I suppose I could recommend that if you had another book that peaked your interest more than this one, then I'd say choose the other."
5,Side-splittingly awful,"I read the first chapter online and was dying with laughter, so I promptly ordered the book. The best worst thing I've ever read. What a blast!"
3,Bad? Yes. Funny? Hmmm...,"This is a good example of how not to write. The thing is though: if I want to read something like that I could also resort to literally hundreds of thousands of fan stories littered all over the Internet. About 99% of those are pure, unadulterated crap like this. Then again, this has been published by a renowned company, which perhaps sets it a bit apart--aside from the fact that, yes, this is indeed terrible on every level."
3,Occasionally atrociously sloppy copy-editing,"As others have said, this book gets your feet wet: it could help along a developing interest in poetry. (As opposed to encouraging the consumer to rest on her laurels with a self-satisfied air.) All the same, call me a stickler, but there are some really unconscionably bad typos in the reprinting of some of the poems--which is especially ironic given the rather irritatingly triumphalist (""the top""??) status accorded to these poems. Some of these are just sloppy. Still, to cite the most egregious example of this I could find: Roethke's ""In a Dark Time"" is printed with its last two stanzas missing--wtf?"
5,solid volume,"I bought this book in hardback after enjoying the paperback version for years at my grandparents' house. There is a great variety of poets, styles, and works. I like the commentary at the bottom of every page giving insight into the poet or poem, and the short biographical paragraph introducing the poets so that I have a frame of reference for them. Poets range from the 13th to the 20th centuries, and over 120 poets are included. The arrangement of poems is chronologically by poet's birthday.Harmon includes lots of well-known authors, (like Shakespeare, Donne, Blake, Keats, Dickinson, Poe, Housman and Frost,) lesser-known favorites of mine (H. Vaughn, Edward Gray, Francis Thompson and Gelett Burgess,) and many poets I'd never heard of. I still find new friends and revisit old favorites. I'm a grad student now, and hope to keep this book on my shelf to read to my grandkids one day."
5,Best Poetry Book Ever!!,"This is the absolute best poetry book ever compiled! I love this book. I used to own a paperback copy of it many years ago and it was lost during a move. I was so upset about it. At that time I did not know about Amazon. So I went years without it :o( Then, for an anniversary gift, my husband bought this book for me from Amazon!. I was so happy that I could have cried! I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS BOOK!!! IT IS WELL WORTH THE PRICE!Litha"
3,Better collections out there,"First, I must say that this book is essential to any poety lover's collection; however, I have seen and read bits of other- much older, however- collections of poetry that contain truly the best poems. Not to say that the poems contained herein are not great; however, I wonder about ranking a few of them in the top 500. I agree with one of the other reviewers about the commentary; I think it is quite poor."
4,a fine collection,it delivers what it promises; perhaps a few more words of commentary would have enlightened it further.
3,not as shown but still ok,"When we ordered our light covers from the store, they sent us 2 different styles. The one we wanted was like the one shown with the small letters. They sent us one with big letters....that was ok since it matches our other one. I rated the item 3...though the actual item is probably better but I put a 3 because it is not like shown. I wanted the small letter one but I have since been told it has been discontinued...well, then remove it from the website."
4,On My Jeep today,I still sport these over 5 years later. Worth it.. they protect your lights and look nice. I am pretty happy. They have not faded or cracked. worth it. I think you have to buy seperate... If I remember only one comes in a pack.
3,So So,"I bought to help out a friend, she did file and was successful. Somewhat complicated for the non-bean counter, but that's the intent of the IRS."
5,A top reference both for filers and for public library reference sections.,"If you're behind on your bills and creditors are threatening, you can consider filing for Chapter 13 bankruptcy protection - and the 8th updated edition of Chapter 13 Bankruptcy will save you a fortune in attorney fees and confusion. Learn how to determine qualifications, understanding the law's protections, fill out and file forms, pay off debts and represent yourself in court: it's been completely rewritten to reflect the latest changes to federal bankruptcy law and includes all the latest facts, making this a top reference both for filers and for public library reference sections."
5,Good job,The author did a good job organizing the information in this book.I would also recommend Surviving Financial Disasters by Tiffany R. Love which comes with a CD ROM and actual sample court documents from someone who has been there and done that. Also tells what to expect after you filed your papers.
4,Shinehead wicked everytime!!!!,"From the fast talking to the singing to the whistling. Shinehead is wicked. ""Know How Fi Chat"" was always my favorite off this classic CD. Wasn't able to pick up everything he said when I first heard it, but some time later when I put it all together the word ""Genius"" came to mind. Lyrically, shinehead was ""ahead"" of his time (no pun intended)"
1,The Night Riders / Lone Star Bullets,"1. Nothing derogatory about the movie in itself. Just be aware that it is in Italian ONLY. No English language or sub-titles.2. The advertisement lists 2 movies titles, ""The Night Riders"" and ""Lone Star Bullets"". This is untrue. There is ONLY one movie, ""The Night Riders""."
5,Grandma Val,I am 64 years old and this is the only facial moisturizing creme I have used for years. It provides just the right about of soothing moisture for my face and neck without being greasy. It is also gluten-free which gives me peace of mind. I can't often find it in the few stores we have in a southeastern New Mexico town so I order from Amazon.com. It's nice to know that I can rely on one place to carry this product I use daily.
4,Good for 2-3 year olds,"We checked this book out of the library and my 2.75 year oldloves it. The sentences are too complicated for him, but he likes thepictures and the detailed explanation of the firefighter's equipment on the last page."
5,Firetrucks!!!,"My 2-yr old grandson loves to ""read"" this at naptime, after a morning of playing with his Fireman's had and his firetruck!"
1,Cluttered and lacking in substance,"I recently bought the fire truck and train books in this series hoping to expand my 26 month old son's library of vehicle stories, and neither if us can manage to make it to the end of either one. The singsong-y text is annoying to me and confusing for my son, adding words that don't quite belong in order to rhyme. The illustrations are cute but unsatisfying and confusing-- even an 18 month old knows that birds don't drive fire trucks, and there's no context like there is in Richard Scarry's books to make that whole animal-community-worker thing make sense. Sorry to be so negative, but honestly, these books just completely grate on both of us. Try Scarry's Things That Go for whimsy, Lois Lenski's ""Little"" vehicle series for straightforward, calming and realistic text with childlike but beautiful illustrations, or the ""There Goes A..."" video series for real-life view of vehicles at work. But skip these books."
4,It's pretty good.,"It's a pretty cute book. It rhymes and the rhymes educate him about fire trucks, firemen's gear, etc. My grandson asks for it often"
5,This is all you need,"Stops hair from burning, wonderful smell, after curling with an iron your hair looks silky, soft and beautiful. Spray bottle iseasy to use and sprays where you need it."
2,Honestly?,"I combed my hair, then spritzed on this product and could barely get the comb through my hair. Fell for all the rave reviews here and on youtube by beauty gurus. I use low heat setting on my hair dryer and don't use a straightener and my hair is frizzier than normal. I won't be repurchasing this. The smell is good and I like the spray bottle. That's about it."
1,It worked well....and then i saw flakes,"I dont know about the reviews that say it doesnt work well and its greasy and all that. My first sprits and straighten was wonderful. However, the next day.....I COMBED THROUGH MY HAIR AND SAW FLAKES COMING OUT. I have clean healthy hair. My hairdresser and my dermatologist compliment me on how well i take care of not only the hair, but my skin and scalp.This may have simply been the effect on my scalp and hair but i immediately knew it was this and ceased use. As i said, it could be just me, but what i know is i wont be using this or recommending this for anyone else to use."
2,blah,"It made my hair sticky and hard i didn't like it. Also it smells like chemicals and made my hair feel stiff. I originally bought it because i got this waver for my hair and thought i should get a protectant spray for the heat, well it didn't work my hair got kind of frizzy. Then again my hair gets frizzy easily, and is sensitive i guess so maybe it just wasn't for my hair type. I know lots of other people think it's amazing so i don't know, not for me though. Total waste of 8 bucks and shipping was forever!!!"
3,There are better ones.,"I personally like the design of this bottle better than the standard product spray bottles. It also has a mechanism to close the valve so it can't get accidentally sprayed, although this was useless since it unscrewed in my duffle bag once and half the bottle leaked out.The product is just okay. It smells nice and feels silky on the hair, and I guess it does protect from heat, but it does not do anything to help styling. I found that it also sort of caked up after I used heat products. I eventually just used it as a light and scented hairspray without doing anything else to it. Really, unless you have a price constraint or something, I would recommend skipping this one."
3,From a noob's perspective,"I'm fairly new to the world of curling irons and flat irons and I picked this up at WalMart one day hoping that it would help. I have to admit that I might be speaking from pure inexperience.....it's not too bad, but it does leave some buildup. But it could just be me, because I know I was saturating my hair with this stuff a couple of times. As for protection, only time will tell as to how well it protects. Give this a try, though! If I have more time with testing other heat-protectant sprays, I could easily give this four or five stars!"
1,Water,"That's all it is, scented water. I had a buy one get one free of this product so I got it. Wish I hadn't, it was such a waste of money. It doesn't protect your hair, it just makes it sizzle and makes it harder to curl."
5,"Great product, great customer service","When I received the TRESemme Thermal Creations Heat Tamer in the mail, there was a note from the post office stating that this product was received damaged. I contacted the seller and let them know that the bottle was empty upon arrival and they immediately sent me new bottle along with apologies. I am pleased with the product. It is inexpensive and I feel that it works just as nicely in comparison to the Nexus version which is twice as much. I am very pleased with high level of customer service and with the product!TRESemme Thermal Creations Heat Tamer Protective Spray 8 fl oz (236 ml)"
1,The great reviews are quite confusing...,"This is probably the worst product I have ever used. Everyone else seems to use this as their go-to heat protectant. However, this stuff makes me look like a greaseball. At first I was using a lot, as it turned out, but then I kept clarifying my hair of the product and using less of it. I have more hair than most people. ONE spritz on the ends still left me looking like a greaser. This stuff is nasty. I ended up getting the heat protectant from Beyond the Zone at Sally's Beauty Supply. Way better than Tresemee."
1,Makes my hair feel like straw,"I've only bought this in stores, not on amazon & I don't care for it at all. I prefer the straightening gel which of course is nowhere to be found in stores now."
5,Perfect Product!,I haven't found any cons with Tresemme Thermal Creations Heat Tamer Protective Spray-- yet. So I'm just going to list what I love about it :)Pros:-Great price-My hair doesn't feel greasy like I just used a hair product-My hair feels super soft after using-Love the smellI may have left something out... Anyway. I highly recommend this product!!
3,Not sure,This product left my hair feeling stiff. Only used once since receiving. Will have to try again. Not ready to give up since other reviews were really good. I will say that if I didn't have gift card would not have bought from here. Found after I ordred online at Wal-Mart for $3 and change.
3,"good, but leaves buildup","I decided to try this product because of the numerous positive reviews. Unfortunately it leavs very heavy buildup on my hair, and I use it very sparingly, so much so that the next day my hair looks like I did not wash it for 3-4 days. To be fair, the hair looks great the first day, but definitely needs to be washed next morning..."
5,Not Sticky and Smells Great,"I saw a lot of tutorials for hair with this in it, so I bought it. I use it before I blowdry and then over dry hair before I flatten or curl it. I admit, I love it! It goes on softly, non-sticky. The best part is that, to me, it smells great, almost like a hair salon product. You can smell it hours later as your hair moves around. Again, I love it and totally recommend it!"
5,I can now go 3 months in between hair cuts,"Before using this product, I used to get my hair trimmed every 6-8 weeks b/c of split ends and damage from blow drying 3 times a week. Since using this product, my hair looks and feels much healthier and I don't get split ends as much. It's very light weight and doesn't leave any residue at all. Very impressed by the product."
3,ok,"The reviews on this product are great, however, I tried it and didn't care so much for it. If you want a good protective spray ION makes a much better one than this. You don't need a lot and it takes the friz out of the hair and softens it."
3,CD,"I needed one song off this cd for my wedding, but all of the songs on here are actually very nice. I listen in my car as something soothing to listen to while driving."
5,A smart and brilliant urban metaphor!,"The opera prima of Jaco van Dormael finds Thomas, who is really convinced he was exchanged at birth with his neighbor Alfred; subsequently he has to lead an anonymous existence and insignificant life. In order to resolve this stigma, he resorts to a smart and escapist device: to adopt the identity of his own invention, a secret agent named"" Toto le heros"" The next step is the unexpected Odyssey, he will have to undergo to uncover his true identity.Mesmerizing, imaginative and refined inspiration , made of this film an immediate cult movie since it was released. The fact of having been awarded in Cannes with The Camera d' or in 1991 talks by itself about its undeniable artistic merits."
4,Very nice overall,"Pros:Nice looking housing and display.Atomic clock syncs up nicely for me.Fairly intuitive buttons.Dual alarm display, very easy to see which alarms are active.""Snoozinator"" a very handy feature.Total snooze time not limited to an hour: if you keep whacking the snooze bar, it'll keep in snooze mode. (This is in contrast to several other clocks I've tried recently which just leave snooze mode, with no warning. You end up late and angry.) The manual implies otherwise, but the ""1 hr maximum snooze"" refers to maximum time between alarms using Snoozinator .Cons:No day-of-the-week or weekday settings. Not a big deal for me.No battery backup. Better yet, I wish they'd use non-volatile memory, or at least a good size capacitor, in these things so it would just hold settings.Radio quality just ok, but that's not a big concern of mine.Not the greatest wake tones, and no ""humane"" waking option, doesn't bother me.Display hard to read in the dark at the two dimmest settings."
1,Me too - don't buy it!,"I have the same problem with the clock resetting itself. It made me late for work twice. It's also hard to see the display if you aren't at just the right angle. I love every other feature, and the look of it, but you need your alarm clock to be accurate. I have struggled with it for almost 2 years and I'm giving up now. Sony was no help, they offered a trade in at $40. I love Sony products, so this is a real disappointment."
1,Dont dismiss bad reviews,"Some bad reviews here are dead on. Here's the (big) cons: 1) random/mysterious reset to incorrect time (?) 2) Where's the button to turn the alarm off? (I'm sure it's some very tiny button, I dont want to struggle to look for at 5:00am each morning). 3) Power failure means you must reset your alarms (etc). So dont think being ""atomic"" will prevent you from doing this. Just passing on some knowledge, to help you decide NOT to buy, as I bought two of these expensive alarm clocks, and totally regret it! So do yourself a favor - PASS."
3,The concept is good; the reality is not,"I really wanted to like this clock radio. I loved the functions and the programming was easy. (If it takes you 10-15 minutes to set the clock, you are not qualified to operate anything more modern than a wind-up alarm clock). The negative aspects of the CR, however, outweigh the design.My negative impressions, in order of importance:1. The digits cannot be seen from more than 8' away. You can see the digits when you are close.2. The sound quality is very bad. It is tinny. Music and Talk Radio is difficult to listen to.3. It really should have battery backup to retain the settings.I have returned it and have purchased, but not yet received, the Panasonic RC-CD350 CD Clock Radio. Reviews are fairly good."
1,Clock resets to incorrect time--another victim,"Like a previous reviewer, I loved this clock until last week when, for no apparent reason, it reset the time to an incorrect time sometime during the night. My first inclination as I scrambled to get to work on time was to blame the cat--until I looked more closely at the clock's controls that night and realized my cat's limited dexterity eliminated her as a suspect. Last night, it happened again--clock time was 1 hr and 53 minutes ahead of real time when I woke up (and no, the alarm hadn't gone off almost 2 hrs early).For what it's worth, I have both LaCrosse and Oregon Scientific satellite-set clocks in the house, and neither were affected by whatever is causing this Sony's time warp. So, much as I've loved the features of this clock, it's suddenly become totally useless to me as an alarm clock."
1,Very Unhappy,Whats the point of a clock radio if you can't read the time. The back lit display is nearly impossible to read. Also the alarm tones are not very loud at all. On my way to return this one.
2,great alarm clock.. missing key element,"great alarm clock. no battery!!?didn't realize until i gave it as a gift to my dad. He didn't want to hurt my feelings and left it in the office as a clock. Next year, i get his computer UPS so he can use the alarm clock.If your power ever went out, NOT WORTH IT"
2,"It's Atomic, But...","If your electricity goes off, you will lose your alarm setting.The time resets ""atomically"", BUT the alarm setting is lost."
2,"Great idea, terrible execution...","What's the point of a clock that can set it's own time after a power outage, if it doesn't retain alarm settings (it also doesn't retain radio presets, but that's a nit).Get this - you set the alarm and go to bed, there's a 5 minute power outage, power comes back, the clock resets to the proper time. You have NO CLUE that the alarm is no longer set. They couldn't have added a battery backup?Otherwise, although it can take 10-15 minutes to set the time (not the 3 minutes they advertise), it all works, and as well as any other $20 clock (which this would be without the timeset feature).Mine's going back"
3,Good Overall - But some problems,"The sound quality is as good as any standard clock radio I have ever owned, but don't expect stereo quality sound. The automatic time set works as advertised as long as you have a location where the external antenna gets good reception. The system is small, compact, and has two alarm settings that are easily adjustable. My main complaint is that it is too easy to hit the volume control wheel when you turn the alarm on or move the radio. Several times, this has resulted the radio volume turned down too low to hear. Once you figure out what you're doing wrong, it's easy to keep from hitting the sound wheel. The display could be clearer, but is acceptable."
4,Sony ICFC275RC - auto set function faulty,"First off, the clock itself seems to be great and has all the bells and whistles we wanted. However, the time zone settings on ours were the exact opposite of those shown in the manual (the A setting was actually D for those who may need this info). Figuring this out saved me from returning it - who needs a clock that auto sets to the wrong time and this feature was the reason we paid more for this model. If it explodes any time in the near future, I'll be sure to get back to you.Addition****Well, it exploded. Like other reviewers, ours ""lost"" the time at crucial moments - like when we were supposed to be getting up in the morning! It did this 2 times and that was enough for me to unplug it forever. I am really sad, because I liked this clock otherwise. I can't seem to lower the star rating, but I'd have to give it 1 star at this point."
4,A nice clock radio for the perfectionist in all of us.,"I'm really enjoying this product. The displays are easy to read in the dark. I particularly enjoy the fact that this clock leaves no ambiguity when one checks to see: a) if, indeed, the alarm is set; and, b) if the alarm is set to sound at the correct time.The radio sound is abit lacking ... then again, I didn't expect much from a single-speaker clock radio.What I really enjoy (and I'll admit, I'm a Type A kinda guy) is the fact that the time displayed is in-sync with the Atomic Clock in Colorado. There's no doubt the time displayed is correct to the minute. I set my watch to it once every month or so.My only real beef: setting the alarm itself requires pressing a sequence of buttons which can, at times, be a little confusing. This is only a minor gripe, though.All in all, a good product."
1,Changed time on Wrong Day,Changed DST time on Wrong Day and I was late for work this moring. What more can I say about this product. Why can't we give something zero stars ( or even negative five stars)!!
1,Worst Clock Radio Ever,"It's no surprise Sony discontinued this item. This is the worst clock radio I've ever owned. There are a number of problems with this item:- The radio-controlled clock-auto-adjust function does not work at all in my location.- ALL settings including time, alarms and radio presets are lost whenever power is lost.- The display is difficult to read at a distance or at a slight angle."
5,"Excellent, excellent, excellent!","As a senior developer I can thoroughly recommend this book to anyone working with Bluetooth. I had been looking for a book specifically about the profiles and was not disappointed with my selection. The author considers every conceivable aspect of the profiles and discusses their various relationships in a fresh and challenging way. In my opinion, the profiles are too understated in other books and too little understood by those who develop it. Like myself, I am sure other readers of this book will greatly benefit from its content."
1,Left Me Cold,I was really looking for a book on how to use Bluetooth and what the applications were. This book is written for the geek and techno junky market and not the kind of person who wants to have the latest gadgets in their home and workplace. I was really frustrated to read on and on about profiles (what?) and technical data flow charts. The screen shots were the most useful part of the book.
3,A timeless item,A very necessary item for whoever would want to move closer to Our Lord and continue one's faith journey in the daily presence of the Lord. Takes alittle getting used to for setting up for readings for the day. A must for the catholic and for anyone else who want to pray daily.
3,Liturgy of the Hours,"This is an excellent companion for those seeking a more structured and disciplined prayer life. Initially however, it is somewhat difficult to understand how to use this resource."
2,Hard to use,"I am following the daily Office on divineoffice.org, but otherwise I'd be pretty lost with just this book. There's a little insert with the commonly used prayers (like the Glory Be) but nowhere does it tell you where you're supposed to say them! Then, if you throw in saints' memorials it is completely confusing, flipping back and forth between the regular daily prayers, saint's particular prayers, and prayers for martyrs/virgins/etc. I don't see how anyone could use this book without something else to help them.I think it could be organized a lot more clearly, and it wouldn't be that hard to put a little note as to where the Glory Be and sign of the cross should be...Unfortunately this seems to be the only option if you want to say the Office (other than online versions)."
3,This item needs an update,"I own this edition of Christian Prayer. It needs an update to allow for the fact that many lay persons also pray the office along with priests, deacons and religious. It is high time that this is updated to include both men and women.I learned many of the Psalms in my childhood. I find the Grail translation of the Psalms to be very awkward. The translation was done in Great Britain and the word usage is more English than American. This translation, while approved by ICEL is NOT the translation approved for use in Great Britain. The rest of the bible readings come from the New American Bible, which is the translation used in the Liturgy. Beats me why they have to switch to the Grail for the Psalms.Unfortunately, this is the only English translation available in the USA, regardless of the publisher. My prayer is that this will be remedied soon."
2,Get the real deal.,Get the Liber Usualis from either 1952 or 1958. You'll find a good one at: http://www.mcn.net/~relbooks/liber.html Hopefully Amazon will get this edition soon and can sell it for a lower price.
1,rip off,Very disappointed. I paid close to seventy dollars for a book that is almost 40 years old. The product description said the book was copyrighted in the 90's and then they sent me a book copyrighted in the 70's. I tried to contact this company and they never returned my e-mails. I very disappointed in Amazon.com for allowing people like this to operate using their trusted name.
5,Great resource for praying the Liturgy of the Hours,"This volume of Christian Prayer is wonderful for personal recitation, and very well-organized. It not only includes the 4-week cycles for Morning and Evening Prayer, but also includes selections of midmorning, midday, midafternoon and night prayer. Another good resource is the selection of readings for Advent, Lent, and Eastertime. Great for those who are not yet ready to invest in the 4-volume set, but wish to take some part in the daily Liturgy. Best tip is to take it one day at a time. Start with either morning or evening prayer, and build from there. If ever you get lost on what to do, go to the Ordinary- it is your guide. Also, the St. Joseph's Guide which is included is very helpful. Only disappointment was that it was not made of genuine leather- but it has held up very well and remains in great condition. Highly recommended to laymen and religious alike."
4,Suggest the Companion Study Guide,"I'm new to the Litergy of the Hours, therefore the condensed version seems more doable for a novice than the four-volume format. Moving through the book still seems somewhat complex but having the study guides helps a great deal."
3,Great for beginners,"This is the liturgy of the hours (LH) trimmed down to its bare minimum. It is great for beginners to get the hang of praying the hours, but it does not have a lot of the material that is in the four-volume LH, and so it is too thin for hard-core prayers. Perhaps its perfect for lay people.The MAJOR flaw with Christian Prayer is that it is the ""official"" ICEL (International Commission on English in the Liturgy) translation. ICEL is notorious for dishonest translations. Unfortunately, ICEL has a monopoly on liturgical texts in the U.S. If possible, try to find a British/Irish version."
4,Christian Prayer,This version of the Liturgy of the Hours is far better than the shorter version. It contains all the feast day readings and a selection of regular readings. If you want to go deeper into the Office of Readings you would do better with the complete four volumes of the Liturgy of the Hours.
4,Takes some getting used to,"When I first received Christian Prayer I was a bit lost with all the page turning needed for saying morning and night prayers. I didn't know if I was using the book the way it was intended. I think after using it several times I know what I am doing now. All it takes is some time to ""stick with it"" and learn generally where everything is. There is a guide that comes with the book and some inserts with the more common readings on them which really do help. I'm happy with my Christian prayer book."
5,Great Prayer Book!,"I love this prayerbook! I think you will too. There is so much inside to deepen your prayer life. Initially, it is a challenge to use, but it gets easier as you get familiar with it! If you are wondering whether to get Shorter Christian Prayer or this one, I recommend this one. You could get the Shorter Christian Prayer first, it is less complicated, but there is way less inside, and later you'll want this one anyway. Plus, this one is more versatile in mixed groups."
4,Praying the Hours,"This volume has provided a wonderful introduction to the ages-old practice of praying the hours.Though abbreviated, for one living in modernity's fast-paced western world, the opportunity to enjoy fellowship with the universal Church as she collectively reads, prays, and chants the Psalms has proved itself to be more profound a blessing than expected.The construction and pleasing form are well designed and executed. I anticipate a lifetime of use for this portable 'office.'J. Patrick Wilkens"
4,This book is just Right for those trying to be faithfull,"This book condenses four or more volumnes, so those who are looking for the ""complete"" office of the hours should buy the complete psalter set. My recommendation if you choose this prayerbook is to be sure to get the small guide that comes with it from the publisher, as it gives the suggested pages for the days devotions, so that if you choose to serve a full day of office you can with others in U.S. It is easier to follow with the guide. You should also review the introductory pages at the begining of the book as well as at the begining of ""The Ordinary of the Hours"" section before you begin using the Liturgy. I carry this single prayer book everywhere I go. It does meet my needs to be called to a deeper prayer life."
3,"Macho, Shoot-em Up Gore","Adventure and shoot-em up gore for young adult guys, written at the elementary school level. Machismo to the max. Product arrived in a timely manner, as advertised."
3,Legacy Corbel,"Looks the same as picture, however it did not take the stain well, there was glue residue on it in quite a few areas. Also lines showed where many small pieces of wood were pressed together. Be prepared to do some sanding. Probably better to paint."
2,Aspen corbel,I don't know why they put the Legacy logo on each product. The corbel itself is not that nice made.
3,Could of had new jokes,"The comedy routine in the video was good, but they could of had new jokes, instead of the jokes they used in the movie I Got the Hook Up. But much love P. I got all your movies.."
2,Assuages Americans' sense of Guilt,"I now understand why this documentary was awarded many prizes in the West. It does a good job making Americans feel good about life that most middle-class Americans live by extolling the virtues of modernity, individualism, and progress. The only saving grace of the movie comes toward the end when the boys, now men, question life in the USA and long for their homeland. It does indeed shatter the complacent image of the ""American dream."""
5,A masterpiece,"It is the rare movie which packs a powerful message without feeling strident or preachy. The pacing, naration, filming and editing all support the revelation of the situation these young men have faced. Brilliantly done and highly thought provoking. How often do you see a film and feel that doing so has somehow made you a better, more appreciative and more helpful person?"
4,The Crosswalk Between Two Vastly Different Earths,"An emotionally-charged, unflinching look at the vast cultural gap between suburban America and war-ravaged central Africa. When a select few members of an impoverished clan of Sudanese expats are voluntarily selected for transplant to the United States, it seems like an act of charity. But after three months, these tall, eager, warm-hearted refugees - many of whom were fascinated by the electric lights above their seats on the flight over - are expected to come to terms with this brave new world, acclimate to the new social and temperate climates, find work and begin paying down the air fare Uncle Sam extended to them. Their passion to do so, and the extent of their successes over the ensuing years, is a source of deep inspiration. It's not without a political agenda, as is the case with most documentaries in this vein, but even after casting that aside there's a rich, poignant message waiting here."
5,Review of God Grew Tired of Us,"Excellent and powerful. We need to give thanks that we live in countries that are not war torn as Sudan. This documentary shows the determination, faith and above all, hope and the overcoming of seemingly insuperable odds."
5,heartwrenching and ultimately uplifting,This movie blew me away. Words cannot convey how meaningful this movie was. I will be buying copies for friends and family this Christmas. Please see it and prepare to be moved.
5,Beyond inspiring,"I cannot believe I am the first person to review this movie. An overwhelming story of hope in spite of unbelievable sufferering, and yet full of surprising humor. I was afraid it would be dull and heart-breaking, but I was surprised at the humor especially when the boys first come to the US.Their perspective on the US culture is very sobering and still hopeful. Everyone should see this movie especially young people. What these men have been through is beyond inspiring. It challenges me to make the most of my opportunities."
4,More than just anthropology.,"This is the perfect companion to Colin Turnbull's ""The forest people"", a anthropology reader, popular in the sixties. Turnbull lived with the pygmies in the fifties where he made these recordings. If you enjoy being transported in time and culture or if you like music in its rawest form then you will enjoy this CD.Pygmy Music is perhaps best described as bursts of harmonic yoldeling, intertwining in a dynamic, rhythmic fashion. It could be quite hypnotising and the enviromental forest setting makes the overall effect fascinating.For example the thunder clap in the Elephant Hunting Song brings the song to an end and chatter from the participants. In the Leaf Carrying Song girls sing a few improvised lines followed by a chorus, which breaks off sharply so they can listen to the echo. The silence, the twitter of birds, the faint echo. Some fascinating listening and a great supplement to the book."
5,Great platter,"I bought this platter to add to a set of dinnerware. It is a perfect size and has a nice weight, not fragile. It's pretty and festive. I highly recommend it."
5,GREAT Platter!,"Don't laugh but I use this thing year round. It's the perfect size for sweet corn in the summer and it's also a little refreshing to look at in 90 degree heat! That aside, mine gets used continuously and it still looks great. I load it up with everything you can imagine and the presentation is so beautiful on this platter. I've had mine for 12 years now and it still looks new. Amazon's $20 pricetag is just awesome too! I paid more than that at an outlet!"
4,Nice,I love this CD player with radio etc.! I gave it four stars because I thought the instructions for programming the presets were a little confusing.
1,Huh?!!!!,"I got this player because of its great reviews. Blows away any mp3 hard drive player. one person said that. yeah, right. I got mine 7 months ago. now when you start it up it makes wierd scratchy and popping sounds. Other people have had this problem too. I'm goin out to get a Creative Labs Zen Micro 5 gb."
4,Hawkwind - 'Sonic Attack' (Griffin/EBS),"'Sonic Attack' was originally released in 1981,in the UK only.Two original members are present,Dave Brock and lead guitarist Huw-Lloyd Langton.Brock and Langton supply most of the vocals on this eleven track CD although world reknown science fiction writer/poet Michael Moorcock lends his vocal chords on ""Coded Languages"".The best cuts are ""Psychosonia"",""Living On A Knife Edge"",""Disintegration"" and ""Streets Of Fear"".There's a cool bonus track added ""Trans-Dimensional Man"" which I believe is a tough-to-find b-side of an old single 45.Comes with a keen 8 page full color booklet."
1,Dont buy from these people!,I purchased 12 cans of this product and it came from TCI I believe was the company. Five of the 12 cans were completely hardened already and I sent two e-mails to them asking what to do about it with no reply!!! Beware buying from that company they have NO customer service what so ever!!!!!!!!!
5,After Glow,"I loved After Glow. I found this book just a year ago and figured out that it is part of a series. I now have read each book at least 2 times. It was fun to see the relationship between Emmett and Lydia grow into something more. After Glow had everything I was looking for - romance, mystery and of course Fuzz!"
5,"Readers of Jayne Castle's Harmony books are sure to love the sequel to ""After Dark""!","""After Glow"" continues where ""After Dark"" left off and now Lydia is once again caught up in a murder investigation.""After Glow"" really ties up all of the loose ends from the first book and readers get to see more of Lydia and Emmett and of course the loveable dustbunnies. I really liked how this book was written. The storyline kept me just as enraptured as the first and maybe even more so with the current developments in Lydia and Emmett's relationship.The budding relationship between Lydia and Emmett was really the highlight of the book. I was thrown into the rollercoaster of emotions brought out in this book with the characters and I loved every minute of it.Readers of Jayne Castle's Harmony books are sure to love the sequel to ""After Dark""!"
4,"Jayne Ann Krentz, Jayne Castle, Amanda Quick","I have enjoyed every series written by Jayne Ann Krentz. I look forward to any ""new"" book. I try to buy them inorder they are published. But have bought a few, out of order, & find they all ""stand alone""."
5,sci fi,"I prefer the science fiction versions of Jaynes books over the straight romance. There is always a strong gorgeous man, and a soft strong woman in the plot. They always get intimate and the guy is knowledgable and the girl is miss innocent. I would love to see her switch those roles around a little. I mean, women like sex too, even if we do want the ""perfect"" man."
1,disappointed in Cocktail,"I was most disappointed in this item! It was a Christmas present. When the cd arrived, I was frustrated to see it was not in the original case, rather it was in a homemade case. Further, the cd wouldn't play after trying on a number of CD players. CD was sold for ""likd new' but that was false representation. Thia is the ONLY negative experience with an Amazon purchase!"
3,"Good, not great.","John Cougar Mellencamp's ""Rave On"" is a bit too huffing narcissistic macho and so it doesn't match the pure earnest Buddy Holly origina. ""Kokomo"" is a surprisingly creative work by Nancy Reagan's favorite band, the Beach Boys. ""Don't Worry, Be Happy"" is sui generis of course. The classics, ""Tutti Frutti"" and ""Hippy Hippy Shake"" lie beyond reproach. The Fabulous Thunderbirds's ""Powerful Stuff"" is a passionate and sexy lyric laid on an Olympic guitar performance. Really good music lies on two thirds of the cuts. THe electicism of the collection takes the listener in ten directions, and in this case it weakens the listening experience."
3,tinyperson82,"Does anyone know what the song is that is playing in Doug's nightclub when Tom Cruise comes to beg for a job. I think I'm hearing the words ""sensual"" or ""sexual"". Any help would be greatly appreciated."
3,Pretty good,The soundtrack is just like the movie it is just pretty good. It is not the best soundtrack ever made but it is very fun to listen to. The movie is very good and so is the music.
3,Almost there...,"I agree, I also miss ""shelter of your love"". Especially when parts of the score is based on that song, you can hear it playing in several scenes. Too bad it was left out."
4,A short but enjoyable album,"This album opens with Starship's last recording,WILD AGAIN. It's played during the opening credits of the movie. POWERFUL STUFF by the Fabulous Thunderbirds is definitely POWERFUL STUFF! Robbie Nevil,who had the 1986 hit C'EST LA VIE,is heard on SINCE WHEN. DON'T WORRY BE HAPPY,written and performed by Bobby McFerrin,was a #1 hit for him,from his SIMPLE PLEASURES album,released in 1988,as was this album. The Georgia Satellites are heard on the 1 minute and 45 second HIPPY HIPPY SHAKE. KOKOMO was a hit for the Beach Boys and appeared on their 1989 album STILL CRUISIN'. John Cougar Mellencamp performs RAVE ON,which I believe the late Buddy Holly recorded shortly before his death. Ry Cooder performs the Elvis Presley classic ALL SHOOK UP. Presley recorded the song back in 1956 or '57. OH,I LOVE YOU SO is okay. Last,but certainly not least,is Little Richard Penniman's previously released TUTTI FRUTTI(back in '55)."
5,Brilliant deep house grooves,This CD is a beautiful collection of deep soulfull grooves mixed together superbly by Ian Pooley. This CD will keep your head bobbing and your toes tapping non-stop.Warning: This mix will take over your CD player.
4,ian pooley,"This is a pretty good cd, though compared to his other mixes I don't think it's the best. Then again his such a multitalented dj that every set is unique in itself. If you a big Ian Pooley fan then I would buy this."
4,"John Mooney - Dealing With The Devil (Ruf, 1997)","Disciple of Sleepy John Estes plays guitar and sings with a such raw emotion, it's fair to say John Mooney lives the Blues. The oveflowing emotion is present through the all thirteen songs perfromed in front of audience. It makes no difference whether Mooney plays his originals or such classics as Big Joe Williams' ""Baby Please Don't Go"" or Robert Johonson's ""Travelin Riverside Blues"" or Son Houses' ""Grinnin In Your Face"". Result is all the same: very, very good Blues.If slide acoustic Blues is what you like, this album is for you.Solo performer: John Mooney - guitar, slide guitar, vocals.pastblues.com"
5,Smart and intriguing peek into seemier side of fine dining,"In her second mystery novel, Washington Post food critic Phyllis Richman's story and characters shine and soar. It starts out with a bang and just never lets up. It's a treat to be allowed to peek into the world of a newspaper restaurant critic (a job ""to die for"" in more ways than one) and go behind the scenes to discover the seemier side of fine dining. Readers who liked ""The Butter Did It,"" will be thrilled with ""Murder on the Gravy Train."" Those who missed ""Butter"" should just hop right on the ""Gravy Train"" for a terrific ride."
3,"So-so Mystery, and One Truly Disastrous Character","I've read better, and I've read worse. This book begins in a very appealing way, and I enjoyed the behind-the-scenes stuff about restaurants and newsrooms, but I nearly stopped reading when the character Robert appeared on page 70. He just did not work for me. Richman jumps through preposterous hoops to make him socially acceptable while keeping him driving that taxicab. Moreover, what Chas Wheatley found romantic about him, I found slimy. There is no way I would want to rest my head on that guy's shoulder. I did eventually finish the book, but my pleasure in it increased or diminished depending on whether Robert was on the scene."
4,"5 stars for insider's tidbits, 3 stars for writing and plot","The real fun of Phyllis Richman's series about Chas Wheatley is all of the insider tips about the restaurant business. For that alone, this book is worth the time it takes to read. In this book Chas is working on a series of columns about how restaurants manipulate (if not plain cheat) their customers to spend much more money than planned.The problem with this book stems from this same subject. At times, Richman loses sight of her fiction writing and writes with a lecturer's tone. It's a mixed blessing as the information is often fascinating. Still, it disturbs the pacing of the fictional plot. The plot/mystery in this book is a bit far-fetched but the book is set in Washington D.C. It's being to appear that almost anything can happen there.Bottom-line: A fun read for anyone who engages in recreational restauranting. Reading of her first book ""The Butter Did It"" would be helpful but isn't critical."
2,What happened?,"I thoroughly enjoyed Phyllis Richman's first novel 'The Butter Did It' and mistakenly thought that I'd be in for a similar ride with her second effort. Unfortunately, most of this book meanders aimlessly while the crimes that are alluded to happen far from the reader's eyes. Richman spends far too much time describing the social settings surrounding the story. The actual story that is waiting to be told is put somewhere on the back shelf. Murders happen, crimes are committed, and everything gets solved. Yet somehow, the reader has a feeling that he or she is always on the outside of the action. Storylines are interjected for what turns out to be no reason at all. (Whatever happened with the Jamaican suicide?)The book reads smoothly enough, but to quote an old TV icon, when you're finished, you'll be asking 'Where's the Beef?'"
5,Suspenseful and appetizing!,"I just finished Murder on the Gravy Train, and it's even better than The Butter Did It. I would have finished it in one sitting, but it made me too hungry. Phyllis Richman, if you read this review, please keep 'em coming!"
2,dont like the feeling of the prints,you can feel the print on the plate...dont like that.otherwise a heavy and strong set
1,Broken Dishes,"Ok - thought after my last GREAT DEAL this looked good too. I stoped unpacking when I found a broken mug - without pieces, which means it was packed that way, most likely a return, and I would never have bought it at any price, too huge to pack and return, so I'm going to give it to charity."
3,Like it but not very much,"The pattern for the media plate is not very well designed: it make the plate look dirty.Other that that, the whole set has pretty nice appearance and are durable."
1,Pflatzgraff Dinnerware,Several plates were warped and thin edges...can't understand why. I feel like I bought damaged goods.
4,Pfaltzgraff dinnerware,I was pleased with the product and Amazon's great discounted price. The only negative was that one piece was chipped (I don't see how with the packing it was sent in which was very sturdy) and another was defective. The items were quickly replaced when I contacted Pfaltzgraff. I would definitely purchase again from Amazon.
1,Skip this biased garbage,"The book is extremely narrow in its scope of education and the expectations of the school's responsibility. It assumes all Christians believe the same way and would be able to agree on the approach the schools should take. When in reality there are several branches (denominations) of Christianity because each feels their view is the correct way. This would certainly hold true for their requests for the content the teachers pass on. Seeing as religion is a matter of preference and opinion, it cannot be taught by a teacher who may not share the same views. Connecting the teaching practices to satanism would be laughable until you realize this guy is serious. It is horrifying and a waste of money. Skip this book."
1,Don't waste your money!!,These did not even work. Don't waste your money on them. I felt sorry for my kids when they tried to use them for the first time and were disappointed because they didn't work.
3,Pretty Good...if you get it as cheap as I did...,"The music itself would give the album 2 to 3 stars, but since I got this for a penny(plus s&h), it's a solid 3-star rating. It's not all mixed together, as I would have hoped. ""Test"" in the CD's name tells you the quality you should expect. It's fun to listen to once in a while, but if you have to pay alot for it, don't get it, look for another trance CD."
3,Okay...,"I have listened to the entire CD, and I felt like I was listening to almost the same song over and over. Not the best techno I have listened to, but I give it three stars."
1,Growing Up,"I love Marilyn but I have issues with this book. I think it puts too many demands on teenagers, in addition to the multitude of demands that they already feel. I think the book gives one the feeling that one is somewhat less than perfect if all of these things (one is supposed to have accomplished by the age of 18) are not completed. Also, many of the things require substantial funds to do!"
5,i love this,I use this product with the Laura Mercier tinted moisturizer and have great results. I even wear it on its own when I can't be bothered to apply makeup. It evens out your skin tone and makes your skin glow. My makeup lasts a lot longer and never looks oily. I tend towards the oily side and have replaced my moisturizer with this product. I think using both would be overkill with oily skin.I've also tried Benefit's Dr. Feelgood--a product meant to keep your makeup were it belongs and smooth out your skin--and found that this one is far superior.
3,Ok Foundation Primer,"I really wanted to like this product. It did smooth out my skin and the foundation glided right over, the only thing I did not like is it made my skin break out. I have combination skin so maybe that is the problem. I noticed they have a non-oil primer too and I might try that."
3,"Good, but not worth my money next time...","I bought this on the recommendation of the make up salesperson when I asked what the two must have products from Laura Mercier were.It was my first primer purchase, and, to be honest, I doubt I'll ever buy another one. When I put this on I do agree that my skin does feel smoother and the primer in theory puts down a good groundwork for foundation.However, I don't see any real difference in my skin after I put on my foundation that makes me think that this is doing something truly great. Maybe because I have a bit of a babyface this isn't as important for filling in lines/roughness etc. as for some others out there.This is one purchase I'll probably skip next time around."
1,Yikes.,This product seriously made my face break out. I've used other primers before and I've never had that happen before.So much for making my face look more flawless. ;)
2,NOT WHAT EXPECTED IN REVIEWS,"After trying several products, I heard so much good reveiws on this primer, and was very disappointed at the size of the tube and it didn't provide the fill in coverage that it states. The best so far that I have found for my skin type (dry) is ""The Present"" by Philosophy. It provides this smooth canvas and fills in your creases creating a flawless effect."
1,Laura Mercier cosmetics,"After reading fabulous reviews about her cosmetics I decided to take the plung. I purchased the primer, moisturizing foundation, and translucent powder. Personally they are not worth the $$$ and I returned them. I actually looked worse and washed out. It may work for some individuals but not me. I am going back to my Mary Kay!"
3,okay,I got the primer because all the reviews say its the best. I like it but I don't this it is 5 stars. i also the smashbox primer as a gift and I love it!
2,My Review,"I have bought various books of this subject matter and this book is not that good, it does not give detail instructions on the prayers that have to be said. It does not give enough things to do for love, it is too complicated when it talks about preparation of the talismans and mojo-bags, I think that the Karen lara books are better and more detailed. Please don't buy this book, look for other authors."
3,I wanted it to be better,"As a professional resume writer with experience in senior executive-level resume writing, I bought this book because I was in a creative slump and was looking for some inspiration. This book contains examples of resumes written in very traditional, very standard formats, but nothing inventive. I also would have liked to see more about cover letters.What I found most unhelpful about this book was the amount of text the author devoted to touting his own writing prowess and the shameless plugs throughout for his resume writing services. On a side note, I find myself suspicious of the glowing 5-star reviews given anonymously by ""a reader""..."
3,"Not bad, but not enough","I agree with one of the earlier reviewers; this book is more a compendium of (many) examples than a practical guide to making your resume shine.As a certified professional, full-time executive resume writing expert, I know that personalized information and details can make all the difference. (NOT to be confused with personal details and information, like hobbies.)Take care not to copy the resumes in this (or any) too exactly. This makes your resume too ""cookie-cutter."" It looks just like those created by inexpensive resume writing software (or cheap resume writing services).... You're attempting to sell a very expensive product of uncertain quality to company management.This book can help you, but remember that you can't afford NOT to have a professional-looking resume and marketing documents with the correct content.Good Luck,John Todd"
5,EYE POPPER WATCH,"I HAVE HAD THIS WATCH SINCE OCTOBER '04IT GETS ALOT OF 'OOOHHHS & AAAWWWS'BUT I BOUGHT IT FOR ITS MAKE & UNUSUAL STYLING ITS A VERY COOL CONNECTION LINK STRAP BRACELET POLISHED METAL WITH EASY DEPLOYMENT SNAP SAFETY ,ITS A HEAVY WATCH BUT COMFORTABLE TO WEAR.I'M FEMALE & ALWAYS WEAR A LARGE WATCH,THE 1930'S DECO STYLING IS GREAT,THE BUTTONS ALL WORK EASILY.THE WATCHS' COPPER FACE IS BEAUTIFUL THE BUBBLE CRYSTAL VERY COOL!LOOKS GREAT WEARS WELL EASY TO READ,LUMINOUS HANDS TO BOOT....BETSY / CANADA"
5,Romantic,Palm trees sway under the hot sun as you sit in their shade listening to the gipsy kings serenading you from the hot sands of the beach.
1,chris washburne,"I ordered the cd over 4 weeks ago and never recieved it,will not order from this vendor again."
3,this book isthe most creative book i've ever read,the great ideas of lila fenwick is about lila and her great ideas. this book is not the type of book i'd read every day because it is reaally boring and stupid. each chapter is about a deffrent story in the book.
3,Not bad for the price,Futs snugly n no problem with it when on the freeway yet! Very nice looking but material is not really satisfying compare to real leather
4,Great AGP Card,This card was very easy to install. It plays all games in high settings. This card is one of the better AGP video cards.
5,Best AGP Available,Plain and simple its likely the best AGP Socket Graphics Card still available for sale. Sure its not top of the line over all but I am using a number of the top games (requiring very high specs) and doing quite a bit of video editing and have noticed a MARKED difference in my performance - granted the video card I had previously doesn't compare in specs but if I can run games at high or close to high settings and have smooth editing capability (which is what I am getting) then its a good deal.
5,BFG GeForce 7800 GS OC 256 MB GDDR3 AGP Feedback,This is a hot card. Allowing max setting for games like Fear EP- Rainbow Six Las Vegas and Ghost Recon Advanced War Fighter. The seller ships fast and item is received in perfect condition.
5,An awesome graphics card,"Hi Friends, i have upgraded my PNY fx 5900, the difference is clear, this card is great it's smoother, had no problems in istalling and configuring it. The only thing i recommend is to use high speed memory to get the best from this card.I've been using this card for 2 months with almost no problem.Thanks"
5,BFG Never Failed Me,"My two-year old plus BFG 6800 GT OC failed weeks ago. It went black suddenly while I was playing Neverwinter Nights 2. I had fun with it big time. So I had it returned for BFG (since it had lifetime warranty), and in a few days, they gave me a better model--BFG 7800 GS OC! I am so happy with this.Just note that if you have a card like this, you must have at least 400W power supply (20 amps on the +12V rail at least), and you must accept the fact that it is noisy when it's hot. I was used to this with my 6800 before so no problem. My 550-watter HEC PSU fed the beast. I am so much happier now."
3,"Nice clock, inadequate radio reception","We enjoyed the appearance and size of this clock, it is smaller than it appears in the photos and easily sits in the palm of your hand.The lightly glowing top flips up and illuminates the buttons on top to access to set functions & such which is nice. There are 2 alarms although we found it took a couple more clicks to set them than we had hoped for since we get up at different times every day. The whole top is the ""snooze"" button, so you can just reach out and whack it without trying to press a specific button when it goes off. I don't recall if it had battery backup or not, but I don't think so.The killer for me was the radio reception which was not good enough to pick up my favorite station which most other radios have no trouble with, despite the digital tuner. I like to wake up to the radio, not a harsh buzzer."
2,Poor Quality from Sony - a Disappointment,"Top sticker peels off and radio has problems with reception (the antenna is the power cord I believe, which makes it amazingly hard to adjust)."
4,"Overall, good.","The handle/locking mechanism is a bit tricky, not as easy to open as expected, but overall a solid gate. Taller than expected, which makes our worries about the dog jumping over it disappear."
5,Love this gate! Bought four of them!,"We needed to find some way to have our rooms be warmer without letting the cats in. These have been working great so far! With a toddler and a baby one the way, it's nice to have the ability for their rooms to be open so we can hear them without worrying about the cats bothering them. These gates seem high enough that the cats don't want to try to jump them. Our oldest cat is 12 and the younger cats are about 5. We've had them up about a month now, and no cats where they don't belong! The gates also nicely adjust into place without having to install any screws into the door frames. Very easy to put together, had each gate up within minutes."
5,Very sturdy and high enough to keep our high jumper Terrier ....,"Our 10-month old, 18-lbs Terrier mix is only about 14 inches tall (standing)but can jump very high. We first installed one of those 32-inch gate andshe just jumped right over it. We watched her do it at least 3 times becausewe could not believe this small dog could manage that. What she does is jump toget her front paws on top of the rail then quickly push off from there. She doesland awkwardly though since she's short compared to the gate height.This taller gate we got from Entirely Pets was high enough to keep her on thecorrect side of the gate. It's also very sturdy and the opening is wider thanthose standard height gates. Plus, the customer service of Entirely Pets wasjust excellent. The first gate we received had a few bent parts so they immediatelyoffered to send a replacement and even told us to keep the original one."
2,"Giving You The Best That I Got...Well, That's Not Enough!","Some of her songs sound okay, but just okay. I honestly believe that her last CD is better than this one. I know her voice isn't all that great, but I sometimes enjoy the type of music that she sings. I hope that this isn't the best that she's got!"
1,"PLEASE, DONT EVEN GO THERE! 0 STARS!","How could anyone of sound mind and body even mention this woman's name in the same SENTENCE with Whitney Houston and Celine Dion? The two of them have something in common: they can actually SING, Anita can't! My CAT sounds better! The intrumentals to her CD sound ok until she opens her mouth and ruins the whole DAMN song! No offense to Anita or her fans though, you like what you like."
5,anita baker,"What can I say Anita Baker is one of the only female singers of today that touches my soul, she expresses a woman deepest females throughout her music. She makes me feel beautiful, I have been listening to her music for about 15 years. My sister Shelia introduced me to her music when I was 16 years old and I have been loving it ever since then. The females singers of today don't even compare to her voice and style. I want to personally thank my sister for allowing me to listen to her music because I got me thru my first love heartache.thanks, lynn"
5,Another Classic,"This cd is not as good as Rapture, but it will still ease your soul. I remember going to black weddings during the late 80s and early 90s and one thing was clear...you can bet an Anita Baker song would be played. I miss Anita's voice. We don't have real singers no more who were classy (remember those days). Anita was and still is a class act. Her voice is timeless. Anita, keep giving us the best that you got!"
5,A quintessential gem from the queen of the quiet storm,"Her follow-up to the miracle that was ""Rapture"" is amazing. I enjoy listening to this album so much, nothing else can compare. It's a very magical and vibrant album pulsating with the rhythm of pure emotion and enchanted spirit. Please do yourself a world of good and listen to this album."
4,"Good CD! AUGUST 30, 1999","I CAN HONESTLY SAY THAT I VERY MUCH ENJOYED THIS CD. I HAVE TO AGREE WITH ANOTHER CUSTOMER WHO REVIEWED THIS CD THAT ANITA HAS AN UNUSUAL, BUT TALENTED VOICE. THERE IS NO LIMIT TO THE WIDE VARIETY OF RANGES THAT SHE HAS AND I AGREE THAT SHE DOES SEEM TO BE GETTING BETTER AND BETTER. HER MUSIC IS LIKE THAT OF NO OTHER FEMALE VOCALIST THAT I KNOW OF. SHE IS TRULY AMAZING AND I SOMETIMES CAN'T GET ENOUGH OF HER MAGNIFICENT VOICE. I PRETTY MUCH ENJOYED THIS WHOLE CD, BUT I CAN'T GIVE IT FIVE STARS, BECAUSE IT'S NOT THE PERFECT CD. I ENJOY HER MOST RECENT WORK MUCH BETTER, NOT TO TAKE AWAY ANYTHING FROM THIS ONE. I LISTEN TO ALL TYPES OF MUSIC, AND IF YOU LIKE R&B, THEN MY GUESS IS THAT YOU'LL LIKE ""GIVING YOU THE BEST THAT I GOT"" ALSO. I KNOW I DID ,VERY MUCH SO."
5,She's In A League Of Her Own!,What can I say. This is Anita Baker. She has one of the most unique voices ever to bless the airways. This particular CD is a work of art that cannot be duplicated. Her vocal range is so distinct that only Anita Baker can do Anita Baker. I'm always impressed when a record company can match the production and choice of song to match the voice. This has always been the case with Anita Baker's earliest albums. They bring out the very best in her. That is all any real music appreciation enthusiast can ask for. I live for sound like this.
3,Anita Baker - Gives you her best!,"This is a very good c.d. However, Anita's best c.d. to date, in my opinion, is Compositions. Every song on that c.d. hits you right in the heart! Every song will move your emotions in one way or another. Give it a try. You won't be disappointed!"
4,"This CD is pretty good. August 21,1999","Giving You The Best That I Got is one of Anita's better CD's in my opinion. She has a rare, but talented voice. I listen to all types of music. Whitney Houston and Celine Dion have beautiful voices and I actually prefer them than Anita Baker, but I also have to say that I like Ms. Baker's music. I think it's very relaxing and invigorating. I have to say though that I prefer some of her most recent work to this CD. Her music has always been good, but I do think her music gets better and better. If you're a fan of Anita's, then you'll appreciate this CD. I listen to it all the time"
5,Anita: One of a Kind,"I thought that this album was definately one of her best. She is, without a doubt, one of the finest soul artists of her time, and deserves far more recognition for her work. I hope to hear more in the future."
2,Weird Book,"I grew up in Wisconsin. In July, my sister and I were going back to visit and wanted to discover some of the oddities about our home state. The book is just not written the way one would expect. It's interesting as a coffee-table book maybe, or a book to read out of curiosity, but it is NOT good for someone who actually wants to go see these things. Maybe I'm just WEIRD, but I wish I hadn't spent money on this book."
3,What we can learn from political campaigns (besides that we hate political campaigns),"The value of metaphor is that it allows us to apply new systems of logic to old problems, systems which challenge our assumptions and, hopefully, uncover new insights. You make some sort of comparison, and then dig deeper into it in order to find certain ""principles"" that can be used as tools for replicating success. Or, at least, that's the theory, right?In marketing and advertising, for example, we love to use the ""war"" metaphor - the cola wars, the beer wars, the car wars. We're going on the offensive. We have weapons in our arsenal. We have to rally the troops. It's not real war, of course (just ask any 21-year-old serving in Afghanistan), but it can often help us make work that is relevant and compelling - for us, for clients, for customers. And that's a good thing.And it's why ""The Underdog Advantage"" by David Morey and Scott Miller, is (Please see our review at: [...]"
5,Hit the Nail on the Head!!,"After 35 years of executive experience, I continue to be struck by the lack of urgency existing in organizations today. If there's one message in this book that should be paid attention to, it is the aspect of acting with a sense or overriding urgency. Every aspect of your competitive environment demands it!!MJaroch"
1,36 minutes of poor live rehearsal,"A really too much expensive recording don't waste your money in it There is no spirit, no feeling and a lack of energy If you're looking for a good rock and soul music with heavy fuzz guitar get Grand Funk Railroad at the Atlanta Pop Festival or with a lot of guitars get Country Joe & The fish At The Fillmore and forget this one"
3,Alright I Guess........,"The affectionate Adversary was an alright book I suppose. What I found annoying was the fact that Sarah was so misguided. She thought that she had such a horrible life that she should go give up everything and go live in some dirt hovel. Every time that Charles showed his love for her she still thought he wasn't good enough for her because he wouldn't go live in a shack with her. Sarah did not love her money over God, she wasn't obsessed with it either. Therefore it's strange how she came to the conclusion that she needed to live in a hut to be happy. Not very realistic. I wish she would have come to the right conclusion faster. Other than the slightly annoying heroine, it was an ok book. Miss Pickworth was hilarious. But..... don't worry. ""THE BACHELORS BARGAIN"" is an awesome book, about Sarah's maid Anne. I LOVED it!"
1,Terrible Christan attitude,"This book was written with far too many 'borrowed' lines directly from Jane Austen's works that it conflicted with the highly Christian morale she pretended to exhibit. At the first one I thought it cute but by the 5th one I was disgusted. Granted Jane Austen's books are considered public domain thus no copyright infringement but it was just this huge lesson in Christianity while she literally lifted lines from another author.Rather than waste my time after trying to push past this self-righteousness, I stopped reading."
1,Terribly dull,"I bought this book at Christmas and have forced myself to finish it. It took me 5 months! The first few chapters are the best part of the book. The rest is mind-numbing drivel that bores you too tears. Charles survives a near-death experience and is constantly put down by the whiny Sarah. I wanted Charles to tell her off so bad! He kind of did at the end, but either way this book is a sleeper! I hear the Bachelor's Bargain is better, I hope b/c I have already bought it as well. Are we even sure Palmer wrote this?"
3,Quick goo read...,I'm a speed reader who likes romance and fantasy. This was a quick good read for me - I'd read more by this author. Typical plot...
1,Jane Austin would be outraged,"I found the story line of this book very tedious and unbelievable, however that was not the worst of it. There were so many places in the story where it seemed that the author must have been reading Pride and Prejudice as she was writing that it made the whole work ridiculous. Conversations and situations so mimicked Austin's books that it bordered on plagiarism Vert disappointing"
3,Good . . . but not fantastic,"I love historical romance, and I really enjoyed this book. I liked that the main characters weren't perfect, but, I have to admit, Sarah's character did become rather annoying. I will read the other books in this series, as I really like this author and appreciate a good historical romance. I really love the setting and the time period. Just compared with some of her other books, this one wasn't my favorite, though still worth reading."
1,Really awful.,Didn't sound like this author's other books that I have read. Do I really have to give it a star?
3,"Good, but somewhat drawn out","The Affectionate Adversary is the first in a series. Although I didn't LOVE this book, it did link me to the other two books which are much better.The character, Sarah, in this book gets old quick. I really think her reason for not having a relationship with Charles is quite lame. Plus her sisters really are tiresome. The ""Jane Austen"" style of writing is great though.The next two books in this series The Bachelor's Bargin and The Courtess Cad are much better. They make up for this one. It's an ok book, it's just really dragged out.It's not a bad read, just expect a really dragged out love story."
1,Buyer beware!!! This is NOT a Mail Order Resource,"I ordered this book when I was researching the Mail Order industry. I was looking for resources - the title and publisher reviews looked hopeful. In retrospect and now having reviewed the book, I agree with one of the other reviewers that this book is only an advertisement for the author's other courses. No new information was gleaned from this book."
4,All Time German Classics,"This is one of the great classics in German music well done. If you are a beer drinker, you will enjoy."
4,Unlearning normality,"Outstanding alternative jazz-rock from the textural master back in rowdier, but still fascinatingly intelligent days, remains vital to this day, often transcending any labels whatsoever."
1,Is it possible to have 0 stars?,"Why do they even bother? Do they seriously think that something like this will a) be good, and b) sell any copies? Les Miserables is a masterpiece of theatre and no wonder it swept the world, but we already have plenty of recordings thank you very much, without having to add this one to the collection!The singers have no emotional motives nor sound as though they should be doing this show. As for the backing music (which I suspect is all the work of a computer) - don't even go there: slow, twangy, electronic and corny.So I urge you, with so many other fine recordings out there, don't buy this one."
1,A Travesty,"I would never have thought it possible to produce any musical product of Les Miserables and render it utterly unlistenable. I cringed when I heard it, but tried to give it the benefit of the doubt and tried another track....worse! The voices are poor at best and if you are familiar with any of the other Les Mis recordings, you will agree. Shame on them! Save your money!"
1,Bad!,I Love Les Mis but I thought this CD was horrible! No one had the right type of voice.....there voices just didnt display the emotion needed for this cd!
5,Excellent service..,A new DVD was promptly sent with an impecable case to replace the defective DVD of paying guest. Excellent service. Highly recommended.
4,Hott,"Well, i was quite impressed when i heard remedy's "" the genuine article""...I realy did enjoy listining to all of this specialy the track ""fallen angles"" , ""u don't care"" and, ""never again"" which all with the rest of the tracks make this an pretty tight album for exception of the track ""girlfriend"" which i thought it was weak... The album sounds damn good ! Peace!!"
2,This iz a trap,"I bought this album cuz i heard Never Again, one of the best Rap Song i never heard. But the rest of the album is kinda weak. His Lyrics are Fat, but thats just it. Dont Buy It. Download Never Again and Fallen Angels."
5,"Mature, yet cutting edge","The lyrics are powerful and reminiscent. I love ""hip hop music"". ""Education"" brings you back to The Wall concert. This CD is real. Looking for more."
2,The mouse is no good,The keyboard is satisfactory. It has a decent range and good battery life. The mouse on the other hand has a very short range. The biggest problem though is that the mouse batteries go dead within about a week and there is no on/off switch to conserve battery life.
2,"Good keyboard, but not very good mouse","I had the same experience as the previous reviewer. The keyboard is great. I'm even running Linux, and had no problem with drivers for it. The keyboard and mouse have a range of 6 or 7 feet, which I found wonderful.However, the mouse goes through batteries about once a week, which seems surprisingly fast. This is partly due to the fact that there is no way to turn the mouse off. For future reference, when the batteries start to die, the LED on the bottom stops shining, except for about 2 seconds after one of the buttons is clicked. It acts like it's broken, but it's really just out of batteries."
3,Contractual Obligation,"Brock had this album issued as a Hawkwind release in order to fulfil the RCA contract. However, this is a Dave Brock solo album, with Harvey assisting on keys, and Huw being brought in late in the mixing to rescue some of the tracks. There are some rough gems in here, however this is not a Hawkwind or Brock masterpiece. The compositions are variable, their potential is unrealised, the recording is decent, the mix is average and the production is poor. The three later pieces are out of place, though that incarnation of Hawkwind is better representitive of Brock's solo compositions. For Bainbridge/Langton era Hawkwind, Levitation is the high point."
3,Hawkwinded,"Somewhat of a tired album from the Hawks. There are a few classics (""Nuclear Drive,"" ""Star Cannibal,"" and ""Light Specific Data"" come to mind instantly), some space garbage (""Virgin of the World"" and ""The Joker at the Gate"" are pretty laughable), and a lot of mediocre songs that go nowhere. Three stars might be a bit kind (two and a half would be more appropriate), but I am after all a hawkfan, so I don't mind cutting Brock and crew some slack on this one."
1,The worst,"This is easily the worst Hawkwind album I ever heard. One decent song ""Nuclear Drive"". The rest is pure garbage. Don't waste your time."
5,Great sound and price!,"This is my second card. I bought my first one over ten years ago and it's still going strong in my old PC running XP! I use it with Sonar in my studio, and it is clean sounding, and easy to set up."
5,fast delivery and great sound,Got this over the emu. sounds great for midi.brought for girlfriend with masters in music. must insure you are using this card fir midi in and out to get the best audio. Using cakewalk with onboard audio and switching to this it day and night.
3,M-Audio Audiophile 192,"Does not co-exist very well with other sound card in the PC, causes everything else to freeze. When removed all is OK. Other high end audio cards coexist peacefully. Apart from that, it played OK."
2,Garbage card--WHAT A WASTE,"This card was a waste of $130. It won't do what most on-board sound cards do: record a mix of streaming audio & external audio. If I record an external sound source, then decide to record an internal sound coming from the PC I have to stop everything & change a setting on the (not close to being user friendly) control panel. The control panel in the manual is completly different than wha shows up in Windows 7. I am very disappointed in this and will return it.What a WASTE"
3,Be careful,"One thing to mention about this card is that it doesn't have standard rca connectors on the breakout cable. Instead it uses 1/4"" mono trs cables, which I've had a hard time finding a converter to rca."
1,Problematic,"I bought the thing uploaded and for some reason after rebooting the system hangs during the driver's initialization phase in the boot sequence right after the ""Windows XP"" splash screen and right before the main log on screen. This takes forever at least 5minutes before the computer boots up. Real annoying and if that wasn't enough it blocks my internet access. This card has given more problems that I've bargained for when i take the card out of the computer everything is back to normal.I had it for a few months and have yet to use it. If your thinking of buying this think twice. There is no need go through all this when there are other sound card options for the pc."
4,"a few quirks, but good sound","The sound quality for the card is really very good. Especially noted is the clarity at low volumes, which for me really says a lot. Not that I listen at particularly low volumes but I usually find that the best sound gear has that trait. A couple of quirks; the previously mentioned installing software before the card and the other being that the sound will be turned down all the way when computer is booted up, most of the time, but somtimes it is at the same level as when last used. I have not found a workaround for that as yet and not really a big deal for me but my wife is confounded upon occassion. A huge improvement over the Mac G4's original sound card and I like having a lot of in and out options."
1,"Input recording levels too low,, card worthless.","I have three audio interfaces (USB and Firewire), but wanted a card with no Preamp built in to it as I use a higher end one. So bought this card, yet it is worthless for recording professional music.The input is so low, no matter the variable. I have separate Mic Preamps and Hardware compressors with gain controls, balanced cables and the like.... still card signal is too low.Avoid this low end product as it is an expensive gaming card now."
1,Give it a pass...,Long story short lots of noise and very little options in the included software. Without inconvenient and impractical workarounds even something as simple as monitoring the recorded sound is a hassle. Give this one a pass.
4,Does the Job,I'm using the Audiophile 192 to output an SPDIF signal to an outboard D/A converter only. The card does this very well. Can't comment on any other features.
3,"Competent, but not especially memorable...","The soundtrack for ""The Jupiter Menace"" is actually better than the film itself, unless you enjoy unintentional MST3k-type comedy value.A dated product of the early 1980's, this sythesized electronica ranges from bland to grating. The music is competent enough, and was certainly good enough for the film it came from, but that isn't saying much. ""Tubular Belles"" or Vangelis this most definitely is NOT.There is only one truly memorable cut here, and that would be ""Cities on the Brink"", a driving and competent study of tension about to burst.I do recommend that you watch the film, which plays like a supermarket tabloid by way of a cheap carnival barker. Lots of laughs (especially from hindsight), and none of them are intentional."
3,"Not Pete's Best, But some good songs.","This is not Pete Best's greatest drumming .(For that I suggest you check out his excellent work with the Beatles and his even better work with his newest group the Pete Best Band.) But, for historical reasons I would reccomend this disc. Several songs are pretty good and it certainly beats some of Ringo's solo work."
1,Outrageously Bad! Best at his worst!,"Personally, I like and admire Peter Best as someone who has gone on with his life in spite of what happened. However, if you want Best at his best, try one of the many CD's around with the Beatles' work with Tony Sheridan or any of the pre-Ringo cuts floating about these days. These songs are JUNK! This combo is TERRIBLE and these tunes are without any redeeming qualities (heck, they're even poorly recorded to a one!) Pete deserved a hell of a lot better than this and fortunately, some of his better work is available."
3,Not Out of Print,This book is not out of print and can be purchased from the Arizona Geological Survey
5,Hidden Treasure,Mickey Gilley did it again when he finally released these 'lost' traacks. These solid gold country songs meant to be released in 1989 are primed for the sound of today. This is a must have for any Mickey Gilley fan!
5,NEW MUSIC ALL NEW SONGS WORTH LISTENING + PURCHASING,"MICKEY GILLEY HAS ALWAYS BEEN A GREAT PERFORMER. TRY THIS ALBUM YOU WILL ENJOY. TRY USING HEADPHONES WHILE LISTENING. ITS WORTH THE TIME + MONEY. JUST LIKE BEING AT HIS THEATRE IN BRANSON,MISSOURI"
2,Just my opinion....,"I don't know.... I'm not crazy about these things. I bought a package thinking that a clear screen overlay for my Clie might be a good idea, and perhaps even essential for protecting against scratches and glare. What I got was something akin to a do-it-yourself lamination effect. No matter how meticulously I applied the overlay, carefully using the included ""smoothie card"" to eliminate those inevitable fine air bubbles, the finished job just didn't sit well with me. What I expected was total transparency, however, that's not the case. My PDA screen was clearer and had less glare without the overlay, so I eventually ended up removing it. Fortunately, the sheets come off easily, leaving no visible residue from the adhesive backing. On the plus side, using the graffiti pad with the overlay didn't seem to be a problem. I really did have high hopes for this one, but it just didn't work out that way."
2,Won't buy again!,I usually buy B-12 dots from Wal-Mart but they were out of stock so I decided to try these. They are chalky and the cherry flavor is so faint it might as well not be in the tablet. The pills do not dissolve in your mouth as recommnded and you end up crunching them between your teeth or just swallowing them. I do not recommend them to anyone!
1,no go,This works for me only if I take 2 dots and it will only work for a few hours then it wears off. I will keep the jar with me this semester and see if it helps on the go. Update later.
1,Way too much??,"After taking these for a few days I decided to look up the daily recommended intake of vitamin B12, and it's only around 2.8mcg! Why in the world would anyone need 500mcg per day? I'm a little concerned about the adverse effects of taking too much, so I've stopped taking them. That will teach me to look up the DRI before I buy supplements, I guess!"
4,Simple but effective heat,"First off, a little disappointed that there wasn't a little more to it for the $157 ""suggested retail"" price. It is pretty much a long gas hose and regulator, along with a couple of stamped steel pan body parts, a lighter, and a bag of vermiculite. I had expected that it had a stainless gas ring under the vermiculite that would justify the $122 paid (with shipping), but it looks like just a gas tube that injects the gas at the bottom of the pan, letting the vermiculite disperse the gas to the top.In use, it does put out a fair bit of heat and it is extremely portable. I had thought that I might later use the burner to build a small fire-pit table, but now I am not sure. The shape of the flame is determined by the surface of the medium in the bowl.Sat out on a cool night and it did it's job admirably. Just wish it wasn't quite so plain."
5,Great MPG increase,"This ended up being a very good investment on my Acura Integra LS DC2 (B18B). Before with my stock air box, I was hardly getting 300 miles on a full tank of gas. After installing my new K&N; Intake, I've noticed an increase in my MPG. I've now driven 300 miles and i still have about 1/4-3/8 left on my fuel gauge.The only problem I had was inserting the crankcase vent hard line into the new intake tube; so I had to somehow extend the tubing from the valve cover so that the hard line would reach the intake rubber grommet. Even though the Vehicle Fitment on Amazon says that the intake fits, I think the fact that my engine is a non-VTEC, the distance from the Valve Cover to the throttle body is farther that's why the hard line was farther. So if any future buyers of this intake have a B18B engine, make sure you have a plan for the hard line.Overall this is a great product, and sounds great in acceleration!"
1,D,"WRONG STUFFSUPER DUPER GREAT PRODUCT, GO FOR GOLD, YOU'RE IN IT TO WIN THIS IS IT AND DO IT WELL BUY THIS ITEM! 19 WORDS TO FILL THE REVIEW WOOT! WOOT!"
5,Great sleep mask - Ear Plug standard for this type,"I have tried a number of sleep masks over the years, and this is the only one that lets me sleep comfortably. Light weight, so you can hardly feel it, and does a great job blocking the light. I have been trying to find one as my last one wore out (the elastic got stretched out over time).The ear plugs are standard for the foam type, and are what I would expect, and are adequate."
5,Great Shades..,"I really like having these eye shades and plugs, both for long flights as well as when I work night shift and have to sleep during the day!"
5,These fit great and work well.,I just wish my cat would quit chewing the elastic! I was glad to be able to find these again.
3,Not exactly chillout,"If you are looking for some relaxing, calming, light a few candles and kick back, tunes, well you would be half way there with this set.If your going to call your album ,"" The Definitive Chillout Soundtrack"", you should probably make sure all the tracks mesh well. Solar Spectrums 2 has too much variety of style. In one track it's ""real chillout"", and the next it's ""lets get up and dance"".If I wanted a more upbeat soundtrack I would have purchased something else.My only complaint is Chris Coco calling this Chillout when it's not completely that."
1,This book is 192 pages too long.,"The book essentially is a convoluted argument to the effect that however one looks, one is ENTITLED to be complimented on his/her(mostly her) appearance. The problem with this approach has been pointed out to the author many, many times but she consistenly rejects such advice. Her health is suffering because of her weight and she consistently denies this, refusing even to discuss it with her doctor. The book is exceedingly tedious to read. One sentence went on for over half a page. I read it through primarily because of the excellent references and statistics that are scatterered throughout the book. If it wasn't for that, I'd have deep six'd it after a few pages. Oh, the Epilogue was good...but hardly worth the 192 pages to get there."
3,"Not as chic as displayed, Made in China","From the picture displayed, you would think that this is a simple chic European design. But it's not.It's impossible to see even in the enlarged picture, but when you look at the actual product, you'll see that the base part has some kitshy flowery twines enbossed, which make this butter dish look like inventory of an American diner where people wear baseball caps for dinner.It's not really ugly, but it's definitly not as plain as depicted, so you might want to keep that in mind before buying it. Also, it has a huge ""Made in China"" imprint at the bottom, so if you want something classy, get something else.That being said, the quality is quite solid, and it's dishwasher safe, and I like American diner designs, so I'm keeping it."
5,Very pleased and want more,I was so pleased to watch this video again. My hope is that soon I can order the last show. It is very nice to see this and be able to remember so many more of the people Sam had helped.
5,sad but beautiful,Wonderful performances by Scott Bakula and Dean Stockwell. Great plot. Loved it. Just one of the many reasons Quantum Leap should have lasted longer than it did.
4,Good album!,"I listened to the song ""Montreal"" on youtube and really liked it. Bought the album and was suprised, I'm hooked. This is the first artist that is dnb that I bought and I am starting to really like it. I was also told that KJ Sawka joined up with Pendulum and they are amazing so. Get it and enjoy!"
3,Too many cooks for this stew,"I've been listening to hip hop for almost twenty years and I remeber when Craig G first came onto the hip hop scene with the juice crew. Then he dropped into obscuity and became one of the worlds most respected underground freestyle rhymers. This album starts out with a bang with the song ""bang anybody"". It's a hot battle song but the rest of the album suffers from inconsistent production and he tries to cover too many bases. You know he got the club song, the street song, the I did this chick song etc. This cd isn't all bad, but it lacks the attitude and point of view that can turn this Cd into a classic."
2,Not what it used to be...,"I used to enjoy family guy...seasons 1-3, late nights on the cartoon network. But seriously, i think they are running out of material. for that I mean, almost every episode they sing and boy do they sing. 5-10 min worth of singing (most of the time its not original stuff) and it isn't even funny cuz the joke passed a LONG time ago. Or they'll just sit around and talk about nothing for 5min. What happened to the stewie who wanted to kill lois? That stewie was AWESOME. this new one is lame. back to the basics..."
3,okay,"This was not as ""uncensored"" as we would have liked. seemed not much different, but for a few 4-letter words, from the TV version."
4,Family Guy Vol 7,"Some of these weren't the best episodes, but all together it's good to watch the set without the censors bleeping everything or having to change a word in dialog."
1,Volumes,"As much as I love Family Guy, I still can't understand this volume business. Thirty to forty dollars for 12-13 half hour episodes is not acceptable. Smallville and Battlestar Galactica charge that much for entire seasons composed of 20-22 one hour episodes (for seasons one and three for BSG, anyway, since I still don't understand the 2.0, 2.5, 4.0, and 4.5 crap, but I waited for the price to drop on those as well).And on top of that, the packaging of previous volumes has been done away with for the cheaper flip box. If a premium price is going to be charged, then I expect premium services.So my complaint isn't the show, which I still give five stars to, but the price and packaging. I did my usual thing of waiting and waiting and the price eventually came down, but lets be serious. Shouldn't have to do that."
4,"The DVD content is great, however it is falsely advertised.","The content of Family Guy Volume 7 is great stuff, by all means buy it. However, when you receive it, you won't get what's pictured. The DVD no longer comes with the sleeve featuring the Griffins, just the bare-bones case, which doesn't make much sense. I was a little miffed because I bought it as a gift, and the person it was for knew there was a sleeve for the case, so it just made me seem cheap when I gave them a half-assed copy of it."
1,McFarlane needs better writers,"I was rather disappointed with this one. I was glad I purchased this at Wal-Mart's post Black Friday special. The writing is just not there! How many times can you watch Conway Twitty singing, knowing that is saving Mcfarlane money on writers and animation time! The only thing I enjoyed was the deleted scenes. Seth should take the cast of American Dad and Clevland's Show and combine them in cross over episodes. The Simpson's lasted over 20 years with good characters. Family Guy will have to employ the same qualities if it wants to stay on the air.I don't want to see this great show go off the air; but if good writers aren't employed by Seth, this show will soon off the schedule on Fox."
3,Family Guy is losing humor.,Seth has really lost his touch. Characters have become so obnoxious that it isn't funny. Seth is so far up his own a** with political and religious messages. It's not quiet as bad as the newest season but almost.
3,Video Format Size A Bit Off For Season 8,"I buy almost all my videos in electronic form now, but I have to say I am a bit disappointed in the formatting size of Season 8 Family Guy. Family Guy videos are normally formated to 640x480, but for some reason this season is formatted to 704x396 and padding the left and right sides with black. In effect the video of the actual show is only 528x396, which gets a little grainy when made to full screen size, along with the fact that you can't actually fill the screen with it as the sides are too wide, leaving a black bar on the top and bottom also.Other then that though it's really nice to not have to shuffle DVD's to watch my shows."
2,Fox is greedy,"First of all, I love Family Guy from the day it premiered on Fox, but why can't they (Fox and I'm sure Seth has a hand in it too) release all 20-21 episodes per season on one volume like they did for Volume 2 (season 3). After that volumes 4-8 are all 13 episodes per volume at $30+ each. Greed is what I call it and in this economy, its outrageous. I don't know about you but I'll wait until it drops to $19.99 or less before I'll buy it. Same goes for American Dad.Oh and about the writer's strike, just an excuse to only release the 13 episodes per volume. Fox could have waited for the strike to be over and release full seasons per volume and the year the strike happened, release that season and price it appropriately for the short fall of episodes."
2,getting old,"let me start off by saying i have loved family guy since day 1. however, it is starting to get old. it's to the point where the characters will go off on a cussing tangent for 5 minutes. *News Flash for the writing team*...it's not that funny after a while. once or twice maybe; every other episode, no..."
3,No Sleeve Cover/No Individual Disc Cases!!!,"Only commplaint is that the set doesnt come w/the sleeve cover. I've been an avid Family Guy fan since before the Fox Cancellation & Return, have been collecting the box sets since Vol 1/2...to have this Vol w/out the sleeve cover & individual cases...its a crying shame...not be confused w/The Crying Game, which was one messed up movie..."
2,Far Left Ideology on FOX,"A great show undercut by Seth MacFarlane's far left ideology. Family Guy was the funniest show on television, but it's so full of liberal BS that it's losing it's fun. It must really irk MacFarlane that he has to run his show on the ultra-conservative FOX network. He himself recently called them all a bunch of douche-bags on TMZ. I think for his 200K deal with them I'd keep my opinions to myself."
4,great but missing an important scene from Ocean's 3 and a half,This set has great episode (especially I dream of Jesus) but where the hell is the Christian Bale/Peter Griffin audio scene in Ocean's 3 and a half? I checked every where on the episode and even all of the special features but nothing.
5,"family guy, volume 7","love it. is it funny, or is there something wrong with me? if you watch the show you know how twisted the humour is. it is hilarious. if you are thin skinned and easily offended it is not for you. this show is totally incorrect on many levels, so it is not for the sensitive. it pokes fun at everything and i mean everything. i already have seasons 1-6 so i had to have 7. my favorite episode from season 7 is ""long john peter"". love it, enough said :O"
1,"Will the real Peter please stand up, straight?","So, we finally come to find out that the dolt of an idiot, Peter P. really is GAY!!That explains a whole lot about the guy, doesn't it??"
4,"Family Guy Vol. 7, Season 8","It's Family Guy, so I love it. My only problem is that the third disc does not play in my television's DVD player. It will play on my computer but not in my TV and that is a hassle."
3,everybody knows that the bird is the word!,"I would give this season/volume a five star, but there are number of episodes missing like ""stew-roids"", ""we love you, Conrad"", ""peters progress"", and several others. I regret buying it, buy at your own risk if you don't have a problem with that."
4,great dvd set,"I really enjoy watching Family Guy, I get really excited when a new volume finally comes out. I know alot of ppl complain about the lack of episodes and the price, I look past all of that, if its something I really enjoy watching and have collected all of the prev. volumes then why stop."
1,"This is a ripoff! Only 1/2 a season,not funny and weak!","There's no good reason to buy this...I have saved you the trouble and money.I was hoping that this team would come up with some original material and stop relying on the ignorance of part of their audience to laugh at anything that makes fun of Christians...but no.It's not nearly as good as other sets, it's short on content and short on talent. Only 13 episodes for $25?Don't waste your money like I did."
1,It just keep getting worse,the first 4 seasons were great. but by now all the jokes are stale and annoying. I quit watching this show ages ago.
2,Family Guy is loosing it's edge,"First.. Why is volume 7 actually parts of season 6 and the first half of season 7.. what the duce? Why can't he release these as complete seasons as he did with season one and two? I own all of the Family Guy releases, and volume 7 was a dissapointment. Rather than relying on true humor and funny set-ups, Seth and team have decided to replace that with more F-bombs and other not funny references in the name of being ""edgy"". The censored TV versions are funnier than the DVD's. Perhaps this is Seth's way of letting the seriers die... especially since he's actually convinced Fox to air the spin-off ""The Cleaveland Show"".. this is sure to be a crash and burn! Seth should take a queue from the Simpsons.. 20 years and still funny without resorting to F-bombs."
1,unfunny,This DVD is pathetic. I used to love Family Guy but these episodes were a staggering disappointment.
1,More Eyesores!,"Family Guy is one the worst cartoons, ever created!The Show contains painful gags that aren't funny!This show should not showed to kids, EVER!Why couldn't this be stalled, instead of The Mary Tyler Moore Show?Family Guy is a disgrace to television!"
1,*sigh*,"What was once a titan in animated comedy, and comedy in general, has lost it's charm. It's become a parody of itself and it's quite sad that the writing team has run out of material. I say put it to sleep and focus on a new series. There's no going back from here. But then again, this happens with all animated series, most notably The Simpsons. So we'll see Family Guy get milked for 16 seasons be fore Fox finally cans it."
3,LOVE FAMILY GUY BUT NOT WHAT I WAS SENT,I LOVE FAMILY GUY SO I'M ALWAYS TRYING TO GET EVERY SEASON WHEN IT IS ON SALE SO KEEP IN MIND THAT I PAID A GOOD PRICE FOR IT BUT THAT I AM ALSO VERY PICKY.AND WHEN THE DVD FINALLY DID COME IT DID NOT HAVE THE COMPLETE COVER AND THE INSIDE OF IT WAS A MESS NOW THIS IS THE ONLY TIME I HAVE BEEN DISSAPOINTED IN AMAZON ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO SOMETHING THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE BRAND NEWAND SECONDLY THE PROTECTIVE PLASTIC WAS NOT ON IT THE DVDS JUST LOOKED LIKE THEY WERE THROWN IN THE CASE AND IT DID NOT EVEN COME WITH THE CARDBOARD COVERSO I RATE 3 OUT OF 5 STARS JUST BECAUSE OF THE WAY I GOT ITBUT OTHER THEN THAT PETER GRIFFIN WAS HILAROUS AS USUAL
5,FAMILY GUY HATERS=NOT COOL,"Yes I'll admit there are 2 episodes that aren't as good as the other eleven. But don't get me wrong, this is just as funny as any other family guy volume you've seen. If you love f.g. please do not hesitate to buy this volume, you will regret it!"
2,Seth...you sell out!,"I, too, have every volume so far...but I agree that I'm getting sick and tired of Seth and Co. thinking we're okay with getting 1/2 a season per volume. GIVE ME A BREAK!! And now...to find out that Vol. 7 is a total mess-up of season six and part of seven?? Seth....you sell out!!"
2,Family Guy Vol 7,"Did not arrive in the same type of packaging as all my other volumes that I purchased from Walmart. Otherwise, new quality and shipped fast."
5,Family guy Vol 7 DVD,Came in a timely manner and just like the previous I had purchased it was worth it. My Kid loves it.Thanks
5,SHUT UP!,"Dear Crybabies,gosh,they did the Conway Twitty thing 3 times.i mean people,shut up!they dont show the full season cuz of season 4 being 30-something episodes.so,stop whining.be happy its even coming out in juneLove,True Fan"
1,Family Guy sucks now,"Family guy was great in its first 3 seasons now it sucks.Anyone who thanks family guy is funnier now is messed up in the head.The plots were better, and the characters totally acted different back then.Lois was a loving mom, now shes crazy.Peter was a lovable oaf who was unintentionally mean. Now hes acts like hes 5 years of and hes intentionally mean.Stewie was evil with a twist of gay, now hes just well...gay.The show is crammed with sex jokes and cutaways now and all the characters act almost identical.Seriously...WHAT HAPPENED?Season 4 had some classics but thats when the series started to go downhill.Im not saying EVERY episode has been horrible after season 3.Just 90 percent of them.Either cancel this show or make it better again!"
4,Not too bad.,"Product arrived very quickly. Was in very good shape. Did not receive the poster, it was not with the package."
3,Uncensored...,"I pre-ordered this volume for my hubby...we were very disappointed in the fact that this was uncensored and there was no mention of that in the description. I know this show isn't the best for values and it's funny, but I don't need to hear the f word in order for things to be funny."
3,"Not what I wanted, but I should have known....","Should have read correctly before I purchased this, but I didn't , and should have known that it was too cheap to be a dvd. I thought that I was buying my husband Season 8 of family guy on DVD, but that was not the case obviously. I'm not going to rate it a 5 because it is not what I wanted at all, but I will rate it a 3 because I should have known better and read correctly."
2,The magic is definitely gone...,"The characters, settings, and voices are all still there... but the magic is definitely gone. There are fewer laughs, and the show almost seems like it's trying too hard. There are also too many 'break into song' routines that are not very funny. They need to get some fresh writers in because season 7 is starting to drag the once hysterical series into the mud."
3,Lynne Graham's sense of humor is back,"Reviewer: A reader from Pittsburgh, PA United StatesBack Cover description: THE BOSS'S VALENTINE by Lynne Graham. Poppy sent Santiano Aragone a Valentine card to cheer him up. Santiano responded by making love to her...and suddenly Polly was expecting her boss's baby!RAFAEL'S PROPOSAL by Kim Lawrence. Natalie's boss, Rafael Ransome, thought she couldn't be a single mom and do her job. But then he offered her a stunning career move--a Valentine's Day marriage proposal!This Lynne Graham story is not as somber as some of her other ones. Poppy is nice and Santiano is not as Alpha male as some of her other heroes. And there are parts that are funny. This story has some of the lightness of the SPANISH GROOM. Try it.The Kim Lawrence story was OK, I just got tired after awhile of all the strident-I'm a single mom doing my best and you'reunfeeling--stuff. I really bought this for the Lynne Graham story and was glad I did."
2,Lynne Graham's The Valentine Boss,"I only read The Valentine Boss and I was utterly disappointed. I rushed to read it when I read the positive reviews but expect for one or two spots, there was really no humor.The heroine appeared stupid, she created a whole mess and made assumptions without any proof. She left after their night together - oh wait not only did she quit her job she also left the city. Had she stayed there wouldn't even have been a misunderstanding.The misunderstandings were really unnecessary.The hero was ok but for the first half of the book, I didn't get any real emotions from him even though there was his point of view. He stroked me as cold and lonely. It's only when he found out about the baby that his feelings were clearer."
4,A book to last way past toddlerhood,"My son is almost 32 months, and knows all his colors and letters. This book is a terrific ""next step"" for him. It encourages thought by asking questions, for example, ""What do you think the girl in this picture is thinking?"" So it's way beyond simple ABCs and colors. With the book leading the way, I am encouraged to make up some of my own thought provoking questions for my son."
5,Awesome read.,"I couldn't stop reading it until the end. Author presented his views and experiences with little bit of added artistic freedom, which makes this book even more interesting to read. Read and drink! You wont be disappointed. It made me visit Nana Plaza in BKK"
2,The worst Thailand has to offer,I believe the author took the experiences of maybe 100 to 200 fat ugly farangs and condensed their experiences into one loser of a character.There is good in Thailand.
5,Just extraordinary,"I just loved this book and went trough it at a furious paste. The author describe Thailand perfectly. I have traveled in Thailand many times, and I am living as an expat in Asia for many years. This books not only explains Thailand but describe the reality of the life of an expat in Asia with its joys and frustration.You just can't stop reading, going to next page just to have a little more.There are many reviews describing well this book so I won't say more than please read it it's a gem."
4,A New Delafield,"Katherine Forrest has been writing the Kate Delafield mysteries for a couple of decades. For a while, they had become formulaic, but with Hancock Park, she has become a mystery writer worthy of the name. She's no P.D. James or Laurie R. King, but she has written a fine mystery with a surprise ending. Unlike some other writers, she shared all the clues with the reader, and still came up with an unexpected ending.In addition to a terrific mystery, it is also a very good character study. Detective Delafield has matured over the years, and in this outing her partner walks out and forces Delafield to face up to her own shortcomings."
1,You get what you pay for,"This Penn-Plax heater is terribly inconsistent in keeping water temperatures adequate. I've experienced 10 degree fluxtuations when I simply move my tanks across the room. Right now I have three of these horrible heaters and am in the process of replacing all of them. Very touchy control knob/temperature settings to the point where you can just about sneeze near the thing, and find the temperature go up by 6 or so degrees. I have to constantly monitor water temperature with a digital thermometer to keep my fish from baking or freezing with these so-called ""heaters."" I guess you get what you pay for, and at under $10, these heaters are a waste of money. Go with a Rena Cal, Hydor Theo, or Visi-Therm Deluxe for peace of mind."
3,Squeal to the sky,"3 1/2Though its weaponry can occasionally become redundant make no mistake, this is measured musical meth."
4,Apoplexy Now,"Sheer bombast. Zorn and company play with a ferocity that is nothing short of breathtaking, but these aren't pyrotechnics for the hell of it. You can feel the artists' deep love and respect for the material chosen, and the listener comes away feeling that the intensity, the euphoria, has been drawn from the musicians via something bordering on divine inspiration."
2,Not up to the usual standard of Zorn releases.,"Whilst an interesting listen comparing the 2 saxophonists coming out of each speak, and for a few listens it does hold some amount of enjoyment. After repeated listens it becomes abit boring, almost repetitive. Would be much better with less full on noise and squeals of saxophone and endless drum rolls on the snare."
2,They just don't get it!,"Beautifully written book,but all the poetry,art,& politics don't change a thing,there is overwhelming evidence this man is guilty & none that I can see that shows he's not. I think the author's talents were wasted on this one."
1,This book is garbage,"Look at the evidence,which this book likes to dance around,then take up a real & worthy cause,which this case is clearly not."
1,The ignorance showed by these authors is incredible,"Look, it is time to set the record straight. I am against the death penalty, and admit the U.S. justice system is flawed and corrupt, but MUMIA IS GUILTY. All you idiots who want to free this cold-blooded killer are as ignorant as any white supremist. Study the case, carefully, like I did, and you will uncover the truth. He killed Faulkner, and he recieved his fair trial. Somehow, hundreds of thousands of people have allowed themselves to be sucked into supporting this murderer. Listen, Mumia supporters, read the case, not garbage propaganda like this book, and make an unbiased judgement. You really are fools if you waste one more breath on this guy. There are people truly innocent on death row who deserve your help more."
3,The disks are fine but the cd case is majorly damaged,"The CDs are in good condition and I like the music on them, but the case is mostly damaged.Jue"
1,"Pretty face, but........","Looks great in my country kitchen, but it drips everytime it is turned off.Now the handle has begun to loosen and I have to bring out the Allen wrench and re tighten every couple of days.Don't buy this faucet."
4,Great faucet,"We love this faucet- it has been installed for a year and a half, and it still works beautifully. The switch from stream to spray is very convenient, and the the pullout handle smoothly retracts, every time.Two reasons it doesn't get 5 stars: the soap dispenser doesn't pop up after use, and all of the joints show hard water buildup that is very noticeable on the rubbed bronze finish."
2,Not top-notch quality,"This looks very nice for the price we paid (well below MSRP), but this faucet is not up to MOEN quality. We only bought the Delta because Moen didn't make a pull-out, chrome faucet with a soap dispenser. The problem with this faucet is that the water doesn't stop when you turn it off - it continues to trickle out for a second, then continues to drip for approx. 10 seconds. It's a minor annoyance, I admit, but I've never seen any other faucet in this price range do that before."
2,"Yet another BOM pick apart, Burnt Over circumstances?","My hobby is real estate law during burnt over district and then OH, IL, MO expulsion of the ""Mormons"". I am not a pro, just a burnt out atty. So where's the beef? Lots of backwards (through the) BOM anlysis (which is conjecturally important sic.), but look to Marq. and source docs for more evidence. Burnt over district engineering/digging of the canals and NY property issues? Why did every body hate the Jews (and the Mormons)? Histo(e)rically hate a group that doesen't compromise or back down to death, manipulate free courts to protect edgy finance ->gangs. Where is a book about what happens to BrOvDis women who wouldn't give it up with the men in jail and kids starving?"
4,That is what they cost,"That is the price they sell for. It does not matter if it's for home use or you are in the arcade business, you will have to pay this price to get this machine."
4,not bad if you think about it,"lets put it this way the machine is pricey I agree with that, but it will practically pay itself off...loan it to an arcade for awhile, kids practically swarm around the machine desperately search for quarters so they can play...think about it"
1,Good Price....NNNNOT,"Maybe if this was the price of the ""You Save"" amount then it might be worth it. But for the amount of a decent car, I do not suggest anyone even give this a second thought. The price might be a joke, if it is its pretty good, if not, this might be the most idiotic price ever."
1,Stay far away,This machine is far inferior to In The Groove 2. If you can find a dedicated In The Groove 2 cabinet buy it.
1,Crazy.,"Nice machine, But the price is ridiculous. I know it's brand new, but come on, if someone is buying it here, they AREN'T gonna make money off of it, why should it be that much? 18,000 is nuts for that."
2,social grunt doesnt work,all the sounds work ok except for you cant hear the social grunt on max volume with the speaker up on your ear
1,"monkey see,monkey do",I want to rate the music of the new swing sextet but no samples available on line
4,"Awesome, sensual, storytelling, clean, mediatative, unigue",Teddy bear is the man voice from the past still with the drop dead killer looks. He has the sounds and there is none other than can make it sound like Teddy. He is a gifted man with so much to offer the artist of today. Listem and you will learn the true meaning of love.He gives so much of himself to the listener. He puts you right there as he gives you his innermost thoughts. In Truly blessed he relinguishes and gives it all to you. You can't make it without the past. The past paved the way and is still maintaining the present.
4,This is a great remote.,"I received this remote and was a little unsure of how it was going to work being I had purchased other items that said they could do the same thing with no luck. Programmed it for all my needs, it works great. The learning function is wonderful. Only down side for it was that it seems a little large for comfortable use."
3,One For Some,"I bought the One For All Universal Remte with Learning # URC-10820 and in all respects is good for some devices, but Not For All. It fails to link to my Directtv Receiver, even with the codes provided for this receiver. Not even in search. Now I have to look for one that will work with ALL my devices. Let the consumer know what 'IT WON'T' work with."
3,"Not really ""One for All""","I don't have much to say about this remote excpet that I returned it without opening the package: My Oppo Blue-ray player is not listed in the code list on the back. Maybe there's a way to download the codes for oppo products, but I just didn't want to bother. Users of Oppo be aware."
3,Good value for the money,"Buttons are rather small and impossible to read in dim light. You'll need to be able to see the buttons since many buttons with different functions are near to each other and of the same size and shape. Codes are not available for many brands, such as OPPO DVD players. But, the learning function works as it should and you can program this remote using your device's original remote fairly easily. The only button that is illuminated is the on/off button - figure that one out."
3,Need to send in to upgrade,"I previously owned an 8910 and it was great, but one of the buttons was sticking and thought this would be a good choice as the 8910 was no longer available. Well seeing that it was a learning and upgradeable remotw, I figured it was a good choice. So much for that idea, you have to mail it in to upgrade as opposed to them sending you a sound file on the computer. Oh well live and learn."
3,Problems with buttons,"At first this product worked fine, I have been using this make for years. After about three weeks it is getting very sluggish and hard to change channels. I would not buy this again."
3,"Very nice, but didn't work with my receiver very well","This device worked with all of my devices except my Pioneer tuner-amp. All-In-One said it would work, but the functions were very limited. What I needed was to control the subwoofer for my surround sound, and it couldn't. I finally borrowed a neighbors remote, and used it to program the All-In-One; that finally worked.Other than that one device, it works like a charm; and the price was quite reasonable."
3,Good music but average recordings,"I took a chance on this CD without hearing a single word about it (just try to find a review on this, I dare you). Dmitriev's musical style is strong and very Russian in a tonal style. Don't confuse the musical language as being old fashion - he certainly has a mastery of modern music vocabulary. The symphony is full of percussion, brass, and dramatic pulses set within an richly atmospheric sound world. He certainly has a good grasp of orchestration and technique pushing and spotlighting each instrument. I definately want to hear more by this composer. The music has strong atmousphere and good form.One problem is all of the recordings here are live so you hear pages turning, coughing audiences, etc. The recording dynamics where also poor, but perhaps I've become to used to digital studio recordings."
4,Kraftwerk - 'The Mix' (Elektra),"I've heard maybe three Kraftwerk lp's in my entire life. This collection of re-mixes is actually pretty good. The eleven tracks here come from their 'Autobahn' ('71), 'Trans-Europe Express' ('77), 'Man Machine' ('78) and 'Computer World' ('81) albums. Top of the line German electronica here. Guess I've NEVER realized just HOW influencial Kraftwerk has been. Bands that have apparently been inspired from them are Devo, Neu!, Human League, Gary Numan, Suicide, New Order - the list goes on."
3,Creativity On Hold,"After ejecting Karl Bartos and Wolfgang Flur from the band, Ralf & Florian made a cover album of their past career. Ostensibly to get the songs ""completely digital"" with no troublesome ""noise."" Some of these tracks are slightly different from the originals. Others are dramatically different. All but two of these are weaker than the originals, but ""Computerlove"" and especially ""Radioactivity"" are so much stronger than the original versions that it barely justified the whole exercise in my opinion. The big disappointment is the cute version of their seminal ""Autobahn."" A wondrous track has been seriously undermined here. But ultimately, this project was worth it to me just to hear how ""Radioactivity"" had been tremendously overhauled."
3,Tough Love,"It's tough to give a Kraftwerk CD a bad review - but - The Mix tracks are very different from the originals. Perhaps if you never heard Kraftwerk before, and you want dance music with the usual drum kit type beat that you've heard so many times before and rquires the talent of a pet stepping on a computer keyboard, then this will suit. BUT if you want THE REAL THING, run from this, and get the original recordings. Case in point - the track ""Robots"" - go to ""The Man Machine"" CD and listen to it there - the original. It's brilliant. The staccato nature of the track makes it. Now, if you want ""the dancing robots"", you'll be ok here, but then, you miss the point. There is plenty of good dance music around. No need to spoil classic masterworks."
2,Disappointing Re-werking,"The recordings heard on this album formed the basis of their live show throughout the 1990s. However, when presented without the context of the original (concept) albums these tracks often appear lightweight, somehow less than the sum of their parts. Tracks that stood out for me were Pocket Calculator / Dentaku, which is much funkier than the original; The Robots, which is a little more up-tempo this time round; and Radioactivity, which simply rocks! The rest - while often having their moments and certainly sounding polished in their digital reincarnation - are ultimately disappointing. Especially annoying is the percussion, with meretricious bursts of very un-Kraftwerkian flourishes, especially on Computer Love (check amazon's extract). I wouldn't label this CD ""for completists only"", but I would recommend anyone buying Kraftwerk for the first time to try one of their classic albums from the late 70s or early 80s instead."
1,Terrible re-mix of classic Kraftwerk.,The Mix was an unnecessary release of classic Kraftwerk music converted to house mix. The only reason for the release was to make money on some old material. Skip this disc and buy the originals.Not recommended.
3,The German release is always the best,"This is the German release of Kraftwerk last official CD before they returned with the single (...) Expo 2000. As usual, the German version is better than the translated (English) version."
5,Hypnotically addictive...,"This album should carry a serious health warning: its insidious melodies will etch themselves into your brain... it will demand repetitive, possibly obsessive listening... it's often bizarre arrangements may well lead you to seriously question the quality of your musical appreciation faculties... it will generate a potentially expensive need to buy other less satisfying Kraftwerk albums... and... for anyone over 40, it may well induce serious concerns about your sanity from friends, family & acquaintances.Updated, remixed and with few exceptions much better versions of Kraftwerk originals packaged into a cohesive and very different ""best of"" album, ""The Mix"" is early 1990's electronic dance music at its hypnotic best... but beware, buying this record may result in undesirable side-effects."
5,The most accessible Kraftwerk album.,"If you are new to Kraftwerk, this is the place to start. The slightly modern sound that this has (if something timeless can be modern) allows you to more easily understand this amazing band while getting an overview of their work. Every track is great, and for the record, this is the only remix album I have ever liked."
2,Not one of the better KW albums,"Computer world, TransEurope, Autobahn, even Tour de France are well worth getting. This one really disappointed me. Didn't have what Kraftwerk is good at - this was to overly polished and boring. In my opinion. Some people may really like it."
4,At first listen I was dissapointed,"I thought- Nothing new under the sun, and I thought Kid Bangham sounded a little uninspired, but I've listened to this album over and over in the last few days, and it keeps getting better and better.Sugar Ray along with Kim Wilson, is the best singer/ harpplayer in blues today. His songwriting is excellent- always with a new, fresh angle.And the band is SO subtle. Wonderful"
2,Not great quality,I am not too happy with this purchase. I bought a couple of these and they were difficult to use and bent easily.
1,Look Nice but keep breaking,"The glasses look very nice. However, after having them for a little while, the glasses have started to break. Cracks have begun appearing in the bottom coming up the sides. Out of 8 glasses, I have 3 left because of this problem.If you do buy them plan on replacing them later."
1,whats goin on here?!!?!,"I bought these and when they arrived, I opened the box and the glass-makin machine messed up and the tops of every one of them was sealed over with glass!! And wose, when I turned them over, there was a big gaping hole right in the bottom of every last one!!!!"
4,Love the music.,I lost my old album and knew I could find a replacement on Amazon. I love this album. I am so happy I found a replacement.
3,Great late 80s/early 90s R&B from a little known but GOOD duo,"This is a great find as I have been missing this music for over 15 years. Used to have it on an unmarked cassette tape and it got lost and had no idea of who the artist was or the names of the particular songs. So I did a lyrics search of my favourite song off here ""II Steps 2 the Right"", as that was the one whose words I remembered clearly. Anyway, I found the artist name and album on a particular blog site and then came to look for it on Amazon, and voila, found it, ordered it, received it (on time) all the way in South Africa and have been enjoying it, and reminiscing on old school days!Not many people know these cats or this music for that matter so if you come across this CD on here it probably means you were looking for them and their music and know exactly what to expect!"
4,back in the day,This whole cd a favorite back in the barracks. We would always play this before we went clubbing. One of my all time favorite. What ever happen to this group.
5,I felt it,The whole CD is bumpin'. My wife hates rap music and loved the CD when she heard me playing it. Cross My Heart is a song that everyone can relate to and makes you just feel where Natris G is coming from because we have all been there in the 'hood. I saw him in concert with three 6 mafia and Black Rob and he set the show off. Keep it comin' Natris G because I got you blowin' up here in the FLA!
1,Try again P L E A S E !,"In rap music today the beats are what sells and this release lacks it. This release by Natris-G sounds like it was not recorded on a professional level, the mixing is horrible on the first 5 songs his voice really overpowers the rest of the music. My advice to the consumer is spend your hard earned money else where and to Natris-G go back to the studio and take a real producer with you the beats are wack son."
1,Again relatively useless,"These manuals are a very huge disappointment. A great deal of information that you really don't need. The stuff that you really need is seldom included.The probes are famous for a killing dieing stalling not starting problem, a great mystery that I have yet to read where someone actually fixed it.If I remove the fuse for the air conditioner the engine will die HEY! a clue as to what may be wrong. I will look up the wiring in Haynes and maybe get to the bottom of this world wide mystery! NOT!NOT! Haynes once again has wiring diagrams for lights horns, power door locks BUT NONE FOR WHAT ACTUALLY MAKES THE CAR RUN!Haynes editors are idiots and only provide simple easy to include stuff in their books, nothing that is of any real VALUE. Don't expect much.I wish some one would sell a manual that had the important stuff. Like wiring diagrams for what makes the car run and not diagrams for the sound system the lighted make up mirror etc. Infuriating."
4,Very helpful for a challenging problem!,"I purchased this book because I wanted to find out how to replace the Heater-A/C fan switch. The procedure was described very accurately, and I was able to replace the switch myself, saving the labor costs at the dealer."
5,TAKES PASTA DISHES TO A NEW LEVEL,"If you are a pasta lover, this book is a must! As with other Hugh Carpenter books, it is the unique and unusual combination of flavors which set it apart. Also the food photos by Teri Sandison are beautiful and give new meaning to the idea of presentation. This is one of a series of ""HOT"" books and they are all great."
5,The REAL truth behind the polygraph,"I feel very strongly about this book because not too long ago a relative of mine was accused of a crime they didn't commit and was coerced by the local police dept into taking one of these tests. Fortunately, we were able to come up with many resources (including this book) to dispute the validity of the polygraph in court. Lykken's book isn't perfect by any means but it's one of the few honest books out there that explain how the mysterious polygraph works and the byzantine government reasoning behind using it. This is a book that the government definitely doesn't want you to read because it would invalidate one of their most effective ""witch hunt"" interrogation techniques."
5,excellent service,Thanks for fantastic service from the USA to the UK. Excellent service and highly recommended to all. Many thanks from England :)
1,A very misleading book,"Dr. Lykken contradicts himself through out the book. How can you say the polygraph doesn't work, and then promote the GKT for the detection of truth? His work research is indirect conflict with and has been discredited by other researcher such as Rakins, Honts, Kirscher and Abrams (and many others). Interestingly, since he first wrote this book, the Guilty Knowledge Test has been almost universally accepted as being worthless and little better than a coin toss."
4,Not suitable for stovetop use,"It's a beautiful piece of cookware, and can be used in the microwave, freezer, under the broiler (2.5 inches away from the heat), or in a low oven. Can't be used on the stovetop though - for that you would be better off with one of Le Creuset's excellent Dutch ovens."
3,Decent but not great,"I was looking for something with good colors and simple content, to educate children between 4 to 6 years. This book is good, but perhaps suited for older kids because it relies a lot on longer sentences and more text. All the content is black and white, with no color inside. In addition, there is a lot of text, and less pictures/diagrams. All this make it less appealing visually for the intended audience of 4 to 6 years"
5,Exactly as advertised,Simple basic cord that is in fact an apperantly good quality replacement for the original. Works just fine and was $20 less than the one from the manufacturer. Good value - no problem.
4,same as described,"it's good , but I don't understand why it is so expensive. It works find with my company Cisco Cisco IP Phone 7942."
4,Perfect fit,"I was really worried that the connectors would not be the same as the ones we needed because the price was so low, but there fit perfect."
4,Love at first sight,"My daughter loved this chair once we opened the box. The seat's back has a nice and soft fur like material. The seat is about 15 inches wide so it will fit her til she gets married unless she is overweight! The only down side is the stability. It seems like the chair can fall back if it rocks a little harder. It's good that the rocking part is screw on so I may consider taking them out. Other than that, the seat serves it's purpose."
5,Wondeful chair,"I am very pleased with this purchase. I was a little concerned about the size, as I was ordering it for a 6 year old - but it is plenty big enough for her, the seat is very wide and could easily hold an even larger child. If you have a Hello Kitty fan, this is a great chair!"
5,The last one and best one!!!,"There is not much left to say.Blumchen is improving end of her career by very interesting song.""Ich vermisse dich"" which is her last best song.A balad with amazing melody, and text that Blumchen had written by herself.This single is must for every Blumchen fan and for those who will become ones..... The perfect song for saying Goodbye .Especcially live mix with orchester and classical instrument!!!!!!"
1,Radio reception stinks. Period.,"As others have written in their reviews, the radio reception on this is simply horrible. The manual and their website suggest extending the power cord to improve reception. However, nothing we did made it tolerable to listen any station on the dial; the static and noise were simply not acceptable. We have three or four other radios in the house that all pull in the stations just fine, so it must be this unit.We picked it up for 50% at Target, and even at that price, it's not worth it. We're returning the item."
2,"Lousy FM reception, no weatherband reception","Quickly: FM reception stinks as others have noted. It is truly horrible if you live near an FM transmitter as I do. The 6 or so stations broadcasting from that tower come in all across the dial, totally washing out all weaker ones and all of the weatherband channels as well. I've since learned that the fix for this is an ""intermodulation filter"". Clearly this Sony unit does not have one. Even my $15 battery-powered hand-held manual dial FM radio does a far superior job. How stupid of Sony to not get this right!CD sound quality is OK, no mechanical probs so far (2 years old). TV and AM bands are OK. Timer is minute-based countdown only - no alarm. Daylight savings button to quickly adjust clock twice a year is convenient. Clock is accurate. Looks good."
3,"Hey, It's Only a Kitchen Radio!",Fits under the counter nicely -- no problems with the template or drilling the holes (took about 15 minutes to hook the thing up and get it playing)TV reception is niceAM reception works fineFM reception is not great (but the unit is surrounded by building walls and metal appliances which affect the signal)Weather Band reception works fineCD player is niceRemote is niceNo seek/scan function on the unit -- it's a pain to punch buttons for every 0.10 of a signal bandNo programmable functions on CDDon't expect too much from this radio/CD player -- it's basic but for the most part it works.
3,So-So,"Terrible AM reception in my kitchen. The user guide suggests rotating the unit for the best reception before you install it--well it has to mount under a cabinet so how can you rotate it? Other than that, the design is sleek and the CD sound is decent."
4,really enjoying this product!,"I have really enjoyed this radio! The cd sound quality is good and the radio reception is great! I haven't really used the weather or tv band, however the few times I have tried it the reception seems fine. A really good product for the money."
4,Great Sound & Design,"I ordered this unit for my sister and she loves it. According to her, the sound is great and it fits nicely under the counter. Highly recommend it if you are looking for simple CD player for the kitchen."
3,Good sound quality but poor radio reception,"After reading the other reviews I thought maybe I wouldn't have the reception problems others have mentioned because we live in a suburb of Denver and our kitchen has lots of windows. We tried the radio in several spots and finally found one where the signal seemed clear. However, when I stand in one area of the kitchen not too far from the radio, the reception gets very fuzzy. You have no flexibility with this radio because there is no external antenna.I listened to several under counter radios in the store (this one, the GE, etc.) and this one has the best sound quality but unfortunately I returned mine because the fuzzy signal when standing in certain spots was too annoying.If you only listen to CDs, you will be happy with this. But if you want to use it to listen to FM radio, look elsewhere."
4,Sleek and Slick,"I bought this unit to replace an old boombox on the counter.This first unit I received had obvious shipping damage to the unit itself, with no damage visible to the outer box. This would have made Amazon look pretty bad, except their exchange procedure is great -- swapped out immediately.We experimented to find an installation location with good sound, as described in instructions. We did note some areas in kitchen where sound would not have been good.Installation was a little more challenging than expected, but not a problem. Use the template! The screws are spaced nearly square on the bracket but not quite. Don't make any assumptions.Radio is good to work with. Controls are not exactly intuitive, but are okay. That knob really should be the volume. The remote is great. The unit is very attrative -- nice clean appearance with neutral style that would look good anywhere."
3,"Decent, but not top quality","This item ""works"", but the reception on the radio could be a lot better. I can't pick up even local stations very well. The tray motion on the CD player is a bit jerky, and makes me wonder how long it will last. There are a lot of knobs/buttons/controls that can be confusing. I still have some problems going back and forth between radio, CD, weather, etc. Mine did NOT come with a set of instructions (it was a refurb). The sound quality is acceptable, about what I'd expect for something this size. Comes with a remote, but I've never really needed to use it, since I'm pretty much within one step of the player due to the layout of my kitchen. Installation under the counter was easy enough. Overall it's not the best quality, but certainly not the worst. I ALREADY had the worst...that's why I replaced it with this one! :)"
1,Bummed about under cabinet stereo systems,"Not sure where to put this or if it will be accepted, but I am so bummed about 'ALL' the available under cabinet space savers.I bought a Jenson and had the same exact problems as all of you have spoken of; poor radio reception and one week of good CD operation then, broke. They also wanted me to send it in for an updated model at my expense - brand new user since Christmas.What are we to do? Seriously, I read all the bad reviews and know my own and still want one so badly as I have always had an old GE radio/cassette player that worked a long time.I also have unwanted holes in my Brand New cabinets. Bummed and not sure which direction to go. Please let me know if you know anything more. dandpmiller@lvdi.net"
4,Very enjoyable for oldman,"In this book, coinage or coin forgery in Elizabeth reign is the thema. As one of a coin collector, I am very interested in scene of the Tower Mint. Although this series are for YA, adult such as am I sixty years old are easily submerged in the story.Historical details are well investigated. Fair held on frozen Themes and people are descrived as if the auther saw them."
1,"Stay away, buyer beware","The main problem with this item and I guess any other item carrying the Optoma brand is....Optoma itself. Lack of before the sale support, lack of after the sale support; I should have stayed away when it took them a month to reply to a query I had before the purchase.TV has been nothing but trouble: It shuts off, refuses to turn on at times wthout the switch off/unplug from the wall/plug back/turn on dance, right now it has developed an uneven vertical line on the right side of the screen. Like all the other problems it has had I was hoping that it would go away but it has been a few days now and it is still there. Do yourself a favor and do a Google search for problems with Optoma TVs and you will get a sense of their support standards.Folks, spend your money buying a product from another company. In the long run you will get better value for your hard earned money."
2,Now hopelessly outdated,"Still a decent, but hardly exceptional, introduction to Recombinant DNA. The writing is often hazy, especially if you are not familiar with DNA-speak. I find it a frustrating and unsatisfying read and scientific experience.Update in 2003: they want $100 for this?!?GMZ, PhD"
4,Needs some update,"I used this book for my exam in Microbial Genetic's Techniques. I had the impression that the first edition contained more information on some titels. Anyway, the books is written on a very clear way, even it's English is easy to understand. Good for a reference in basic subjects."
5,An indispensable asset to students and instructors alike,One of the best books available for students and instructors of molecular biology and genetics. Easy-to-understand diagrams and well-crafted text make this volume a pleasure to read.
2,Ball will not stay together!,I purchased this after reading the only rating on this item at the time which was a 5 star review. The ball will not stay together. Its so weak the baby pulls it right apart. It doesn't stay together long enough for the baby to put the shapes in the slots. This was a waste of money but at least it didn't cost much. Invest in a more expensive sorter that stays in shape.
4,Excellent Family Viewing,"My son and I have thoroughly enjoyed the entire White Wolves collection. This one, in particular, has some excellent themes and can be used as a conversation starter with tweens and teens. The film has absolutely breathtaking beauty. The only disappointing thing about this movie is the ending. It leaves you hanging. We have three of the four movies and can't wait to get the last one, too."
2,An OK movie,"This movie was not quite as bad as the one before it. The scenery is breathtaking but the plot is very poorly written. The acting is adequate to say the least. I think that you should deffinatly rent this movie, not buy."
5,El poder de la letra,"El poder de la letra de las canciones de Ruben Blades es reconocido en todo el mundo. Muchas canciones de salsa tienen textos obsoletos; afortunadamente tenemos a Ruben Blades que compone canciones que siempre llevan en significado, ya sea social, político o hasta económico. Ruben Blades se hizo famoso con Pedro Navaja, una canción muy larga que uno no quiere que termine.Éste CD contiene otras canciones como El Padre Antonio, Decisiones o Buscando América que son inolvidables. Qué suerte que tuvo Latinoamérica cuando Ruben perdió las elecciones en Panamá. Haz música Ruben que allí eres el primero.Virgilio Krumbacher"
2,No hay metales senores,"A pesar de que el concierto no fue malo, me di cuenta que no hay metales en las canciones (trombones y trompetas). Esto es inconcebible para mi, los metales eran imitados por el tecladista, lo cual suena horrible. Si Ruben hubiese incluido una seccion de metales en este concierto no hay duda de que hubiese sido un excelente CD."
5,Bruce Catton excellently continues the story of the Army of the Potomac,"Catton's Army of the Potomac trilogy is a truly amazing work. In this middle part of the trilogy the ghastly battles of Fredericksburg, Chancellorsville, and Gettysburg are covered in wonderful detail. Catton's writing ,as usual, is excellent and you will come to know the Army of the Potomac's leaders and soldiers. Burnside, Hooker, and Meade are all memorably depicted. The Corps and division commanders are also sketched excellently. The lowly private soldiers though are the heroes of the book. Catton has many wonderful stories involving the cavalry, artillery, and infantry of a truly legendary American fighting force.Highly recommended!A+"
4,Good Value,For $10 bucks you can't go wrong. If you've seen the Great Man on film you will probably like the cd.
4,Great labeler - only downside is wasted label space,"Brother makes the best labelers. They are easy and reliable. My only beef with the Brother labelers is that they waste a lot of label. In other words, there is a lot of blank space at the beginning of each label you print. I have to manually cut off that wasted space, which is a nuisance, and then you obviously go through a label cartridge that much faster. Notwithstanding that annoyance, the labeler is indispensable for me. Makes home filing so much clearer. We use it for many things around the house."
1,I don't usually write reviews ... but this product needs work,"If you're okay with wasting $17 per tape on this thing, go ahead. I've had many misfeeds resulting in two unusable tapes and (suprise!) Brother doesn't warrant the tapes (so save your sales receipts to take it back to the store). Another version purchased for our office ate a tape causing the roller to break and (surprise!) the machine was no longer in its warranty. I've had much better luck with a Casio labeler which apparently uses a different system for their tapes. No consumer joy in this device at all."
1,brother-Oh brother junk,"I have two brother label printers and both have been junk. The 1180 I've had for very infrequent use will not work because one of the tabs that contact one of the 6 batteries needed to power it has broken off. Not way to use an electric adaptor. I bought extra tapes, but I will throw them out before I buy another brother. The other is a PT-70 it will eat-up 4 batteries overnight."
1,Disappointed,"I read a lot of different personal financial advice books, and I found this one of the worst I have ever read. There were some good points made, but I found errors in the book regarding qualified retirement plans at the workplace and IRA's. There are much better books out there to read besides this one."
1,$99!!!!!!!!!!!,"You MUST be kidding me--that's just outrageous highway robbery for a product I have used, and loved, for many years.Would rate the PRICE with a negative star if I could"
5,Great product,"If you are looking for an aftershave without an odor and is soothing, then I recommend this. I have been using it for a couple of years and although I have tried others, I keep coming back to this."
2,Medicinal and Smells like toothpaste...,"I wanted to like this product based on some of the reviews but I just can't. First, it smells like Colgate toothpaste and that's a no go for me with regard to a face balm.Secondly, it's got a stinging quality that I do not experience in products like Nivea for Men or other shaving balms I've purchased. I want to be comfortable after I shave and apply balm, not wincing in pain.I'll finish using this product because it's tolerable but I won't buy it again."
4,"Good, has light fragrance","Not bad for moisturizing the face after a shave. It has a bit of a light ""Noxema"" kind of smell to it, but goes on light and there is not much of a smell left on the face after an hour or so. I still prefer Kiehl's facial fuel aftershave which is what I will go back to when I finish this up..."
1,Anthony after shave balm,This product was defective as received. It had obviously deteriorated and had turned to a very liquidy consistency. I had to ask for a replacement. Normally it is a very thick gel like cream. This one just ran out of the tube and squirted all over the place.
4,Boyfriend seemed to like it,"I bought a bottle of this for my boyfriend to put in his Christmas stocking last year. He said he really liked it and he's not the type to lie to avoid offending me or hurting my feelings. It's a rather small bottle, but it lasted almost six months and he shaves at least every other day. I guess a little goes a long way. It smells minty, kind of like toothpaste. Now that he's out, he's switched back over to his Every Man Jack aftershave lotion which he buys at Target. He seems to like it just as well and it's fairly cheaper."
2,"It's not really ""fragrance fee""","I like the texture and the feel after applying the balm but it has a wierd smell and it's definitely not fargrance-free. So folks who are particular in buying a fragrance free balm please be aware of this. I also feel that its bit pricey compared to other non-alcohol based balms (Proraso, Musgo Real etc.,)"
2,Nothing special,"I must admit, I am not familiar with Louisiana magic, but I practice magic nonetheless. It is very average book has a completely out of place chapter on animal sacrifize and it borderlines on nonesense. I am from Sydney Australia and I was looking forward to learn about Louisiana magic. This is a bit disappointing I must say. However there are some good bits in it."
4,GOOD FOR BEGINNERS(OMO-OBATALA),JUST GOT THIS BOOK AND SO FAR IT IS FINE FOR ME AS AN ORISHA PRIEST IF THIS BOOK IS USED IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE BOOK SELECTED PRAYERS YOU CAN GET WHAT YOU WANT.SO I AM AFRAID THAT I CANNOT SHARE THE VIEWS OF EVERYONE ON THE BOOK FOR ME IT WILL WORK FINE .IT IS O.K.....BLESSINGS
2,Nothing special,"I must admit, I am not familiar with Louisiana magic, but I practice magic nonetheless. This is a very average book. It has a completely usless (if not questionable) chapter on animal sacrifize, and it borderlines on nonesense. I am from Sydney Australia, and I was looking forward to learn about Louisiana magic. This is a bit disappointing I must say. However there are some good bits in it, especially about the Novenas. Generally speaking, it is not a book to be taken very seriously."
3,Starter book,"If this is your first book on candles,the saints,and the meanings of burning candles this is good. The advanced practioner may find this book a little over the top in some instances. Some ""secrets"" he lets out are better left unsaid."
4,Interesting,After reading The Magical Power of the Saints I was very impressed. Rev. Malbrough certainly seems to know what he is talking about. Growing up in Louisiana my family always prayed to the Saints and had an ancestral altar in our home. This section on honoring the ancestors rang true wihin my on experiences. I highly recommend this book for anyone wanting to learn the real magic of witchcraft and hoodoo practice. No fluff in this book.
4,Truely Excellent,"The Magical Power of the Saints for me has been excellent. It is a good reference book on the use of the seven-day candles sold in many botanicas and even in the grocery stores. It includes information which may be given to you in most stores that sell spiritual supplies. From my own experience, some people working in these stores don't know much to give me the information I need. For me this book is a great reference sourse."
2,Nothing that I thought it was! Kinda Disappointing,"I got this book hoping it was better then I thought it was going to be, but it was JUST ok, some of the stuff especially the sacrificial stuff is just silly and should be taken lighty, but some of the other spells(""prayers"") are pretty cool. To be completely honest there are alot of better books out there, I would go to those first. I personally reccomend Modern Magick From Donald Michael Kraig, it's more comfortable and more descriptive, and it'a great starter book:)Sorry about the poor review, but it's how it is;)"
1,Disappointment,I have read a lot of books but this book seems to be nothing more than a put together thing that tells nothng about how to really contact the Saints or use their help. I was hoping for a book that would give me somethng to work with but this book did not.
4,Read it in one day.,"I must say I bought his book not really sure. Im interested in christo paganism, christian witches and such so I thought this would be a good book to read to help me build my own spiritual path and closeness with God. I bought this book tonight and I. Im done reading it. Its very interesting..ofcourse I dont really agree on some thoughts (animal sacrifice) I believe that is totally wrong . I dont even want to think about that. But the magick with candles and psalm references and the Saints were GREAT info and I plan on using this in the future."
1,Trouble and Pain,"I PURCHASED THIS BOOK THINKING IT WAS GOING TO BE OF HELP TO ME IN DEALING WITH THE PROBLEMS IN MY LIFE. BOY, WAS I WRONG! THIS BOOK AND THE PRAYERS THE AUTHOR PERSCRIBED ONLY HURT. I WISH THERE WAS A WAY TO GET MY MONEY BACK BUT I DESTROYED MY COPY SO IT WOULD NOT FALL INTO ANYONE ELSE'S HANDS. I DO NOT KNOW WHO WROTE THE REVIEW SAYING HE/SHE WAS AN OMO OBATALA BUT HE/SHE IS WRONG! WHY WOULD A PERSON WHO IS REALLY AN OMO OBATALA NEED TO HAVE A LITTLE BOOK LIKE THIS TO TELL HIM/HER WHAT TO DO? SAVE YOUR MONEY. DON'T WASTE IT ON THIS USELESS MATERIAL."
3,"Not the best, but clearly not the worst","I got into Cherry Monroe about a year ago, after I met them at a show. I bought their cd, and I admit it's quite the guilty pleasure. This album feels like a ""special edition"" of their first one, containing all the songs plus a few new ones, and it is also re-mixed. The songs are catchy, and the guitar lines are quite hooky. But in reality the true magic of the band lies in their live show. The cd has nothing on the live show which feels a lot heavier, and it's where the guitarists truly shine. I'd recomend purchasing the cd to support the band, but buy it from them at their merch table, and while you're at it buy a shirt from them too."
4,Good Music not so good look,"the first time ive ever heard of these guys was when i was going to a Bloodhound Gang concert and they were on the bill with them. ive never heard of the name Cherry Monroe or heard any music at all so this was something completely new to me. when they got onstage i thought i wasnt gonna like them cause they have this femme look to them but still that didnt effect the music. the whole time they were onstage people were booing them but i was actually cheering them on for they have some really good music. after there set they were signing autographs at the back so i went back there and they were selling this cd early at the show so i got one and had them sign it. i listened to the cd and there music is really good like i have said. since this is a review on the cd and not the band itself then i give it a 4 out of 5 cause these guys do have some talent. but if i were to rate them on there look then they would get a 3.5nice job Cherry Monroe, you have a new listner :)"
4,You'll like it alot,It is a really good cd. some of the songs sound the same but it is so awsome. There is a little bit of something for everyone on the is cd
4,Cherry Monroe,"This cd is so awesome! I love -almost- all of the tracks!! Some are okay, but the cd definitly rocks!"
3,Thoughts on first comment,"Though I'm sorry Diesel Dad did not find the video helpful, please know that the program is divided into sections... the first is all in English, the second is in Spanish, the third in French and there is the final section where all the words are spoken as a group. The words are also presented in visual form on screen. We have also included a music-only mode so children can enjoy the scenery.At the very least, the commentary section is in English and can help older children learn how they can make their own animated shows in the future and gives them the encouragement to do so! :-)Research has found that children have a high capacity to learn multiple languages early and actually benefit by it in the long run. I'm very proud to say that the SuperRace DVD has actually helped my own children with multi-linguilism, one of the goals of the DVD, and hope that you will find the same! Joe Lawson, Producer"
2,Check before purchasing,"While this pedal is nice looking, it might not be what you want.I highly advise you to look at your car carefully before purchasing this pedal. Make sure there is plenty of room around the pedals, both when in their resting position and when they are pressed down. These pedals, as you would well guess, increase the size of your pedals and that might cause problems with some cars.On my car, the pedals would hit the ground and I would not be able to fully accelerate. While there are some people who would appreciate that, I don't.They will not fit brake pedals with a width over 4.25 inches or a height over 2 inches.Acceleration pedals need to be at most 1.5 inches in width.In addition, the pedals, when they came to me, looked a little cracked and worn. I'm not sure if all look like this, but just giving a heads-up to anyone who is considering it."
3,A little long winded,This book was a interesing story line but it took the author quite a while to get there. The story line was just interesting enough to want to find out how the story ended but I did get a little frustrated with how the author overdid the details.
5,Sincerely irreverent.,"This album defies simple description.Wacky pop that periodically seems socially relevant, ""Flood"" could be descibed as being all-over-the-place, if didn't mysteriously seem cohesive.Mostly this album is fun, and begs to be listened to repeatedly. If you are a Giants fan, this is certainly their most accessible work. If you aren't a fan yet, this is certainly a great place to start.Starting with a clever little theme dittie, the album rolls into the ultra catchy ""Bird House,"" and keeps going from there.The wonderfully addictive remake of ""Constantinople,"" is a sheer delight that dares you to try and sing along.I rank myself among the countless thousands who have this album on their lists of greatest CDs in their collections.If you are even thinking about, buy this one."
5,TMBG's most ingenious lyrical debut yet!,"Particle Man, We want a ROck, Women and Men, and Birdhouse in your Soul! WHat else is there to say?"
4,A good review,It has a lot of songs on it and most of them I like so you should get this if you don't already have it like me.
3,Too mainstream,"I would have to say that, sadly, this album has suffered from over-exposure, and has become almost -- *gasp* -- mainstream! Thanks to Tiny Toons and those awful cartoon ""videos"" -- what were the Johns thinking? (I had to smile when one reviewer said she heard TMBG for the first time on Tiny Toons when she ""was little""!) This album lacks the extreme wackiness that makes all other TMBG albums truly special. Maybe I just don't like this album as much just BECAUSE it's so popular! And that's the true measure of a TMBG fan -- someone who goes against convential thought, and finds their own style. If you like this album, fine, but please make sure you buy every other TMBG album out there so you can experience the REAL They Might Be Giants."
4,Flood is one of John and John's best albums.,"Although Flood is 'played out' as other fans have mentioned, it is still one of the best albums ever made. Just because it is popular should not mean that it isn't good. I've been a fan of tmbg for about 8 years now and I have all the albums. But when I'm really in the mood for tmbg I throw on Flood. Apollo 18 is another one of my favorites, but all of them are great."
5,album is better than ever,"I just put this cd in my player again for like the 1000th time, and I immediately get addicted to every song. Once its playing, I have to listen to the whole thing. I just cant help it. One of the best albums I ever bought on a whim in my life, and one of my oldest cd's in my collection(I bought it my senior in high school 1990)..Oh yeah, 1 cool story..back in 1992 when I was attending Fitchburg State College in Fitchburg Mass, one of my fraternity brothers ,Dave Angelli( who used to call the pledges of Sigma Tau Gamma pussballs), whose brother Paul was and I would assume still good friends with the 2 Daves(went to high school together or something),got me and a few of the fraternity brothers VIP tix to a show at the AVALON on Landsdowne Street in Boston, and we all got to meet the band after the show backstage.. infact at the time Paul was doing lights for the TMBG shows....Thanx Dave, wherever you are!!"
5,They Are Giants.,"Before Particle Man, they may not have been giants, but when Flood hit the shelves in 1990, They Might Be Giants fulfilled their name. Every single song has something to offer even for a casual listener (no! you don't even have to be a fan) and when you're feeling a little down, this entire CD will be the ultimate pick up. Guaranteed to stimulate the brain with political points and entertaining with its catchy tune, it is a Flood of excellence from the two Johns... we'll miss them so..."
4,geniuses?,"So weird that people keep calling the Johns geniuses. They're certainly smart, and nothing out there could be more clever - for it's level. But it's just silly fun, it's not Shakespeare, it's not even Oscar Wilde. But super fun, it is, indeed!"
3,A Goofy Blast from the Past,"I bought ""Flood"" when it was first released in 1990 and my opinion of it has changed little since then. It contains TMBG's best song ""Birdhouse in Your Soul."" as well as some other great funny tracks like ""Your Racist Friend"" and ""Particle Man."" Unfortunately, the album just goes on too long and there is little in the last half of it that you need hear more than once. If you like the band, you'll like the album. If you don't, don't bother."
4,Flooding into Mainstream,"This album is notorious for being where TMBG really hit it 'big', so to speak. And it's not hard to see why, with such hits as 'Birdhouse in your Soul' and 'Istanbul (Not Constainople)'. But, really, there's much more to this CD, and quite franky, Istanbul dose not make this CD. (And neither does Particle Man, which *really* gets old after a while, and keeps me from giving this album 5 stars) As for the actual content of the music, it's somewhat of a mix of thier styles of thier first self-titled offering and the deep themes of Lincoln. We have more typical TMBG wackiness (We want a Rock, Someone keeps moving my chair, and the theme song for TMBG) some really clever humor (Dead, Lucky Ball and Chain, Racist Freind... (as for RF...geeze, it seems like I always get in this kind of situation)) and, overall, an easily accessiable sound that seemingly everyone will enjoy. This is THE CD of a TMBG fan, though not thier best. Unless your, well, dead, you'll enjoy this CD."
4,One of the Best,"""Flood"" is TMBG's 'Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band' - it's not necesseraly their best and certainly not their most recent, but any fan will tell you it's the 'must-own'. I don't know how many TMBG fans I know who got hooked on these guys instantly and indefinitley after listening to this album for the first time. It's the album you tote around with you for six months forcing family and friends (as well as strangers) to listen to. Many TMBG fans remember their first time; that night at their friend's place when those words - ""guys, you gotta hear this CD..."" were uttered.Buy this CD and live the magic."
4,Another great TMBG album,"Flood has a few clunkers (I like all TMBG's albums). But, ""Dead"" is the song that I want played at my funeral."
5,"A great, catchy fun CD!","My first TMBG CD, i was amazed at the intelectual pop duo that had so elequently crafted a work of genius-from Birdhouse In Your Soul and Istanbul, to Whisteling In The Dark and Everyone Wants A Rock, these peppy tunes will have you singing and dancing. Subtle references to history and metaphores to sily and serious things give this CD a hilarious tone."
3,Uneven,"How I feel about this album really depends on my mood. There are times when I find myself alone in the car, singing ""Dead"" sans accompaniment. And there are other times when I think that I will never listen to ""Particle Man"" again for fear of going insane.Over all, I find that this CD is marked by a number of truly great numbers, with a lot of very mediocre stuff in between. Or perhaps I'm just not getting all of it? Well, I won't deny that it can be lots of fun to listen to. Just be careful about overdoing it."
3,"Good, yet not up to par...","Okay, don't get me wrong. I thoroughly enjoy this CD and the more and more I listen to it the more I seem to like it...Yet, when compared to their other albums, it just doesn't meet the standard they have set for themselves. Okay, Everybody loves Particle Man, Istanbul, and Little Birdhouse in Your Soul. When purchasing this album I had already listened to these songs many-a-time and was hoping for some surprisingly good songs I hadnt heard yet, as all of their other albums have showed me. I found the rest of the songs to be decent, at times catchy, but just not as good as every other TMBG song. Though, I did find ""Twisting"" to be a treasure. I recommend this Album to anybody who wants the outlined TMBG feel, but for a more consistent feel, check out other albums."
5,works as expected,"It's just a power adapter, there's not much to say. It works fine with my Plantronics Vista headset."
5,sales rep work at home 8-10 day,"m-12 with head phone works great had a lot of cust say the transmission is so clear with the m-12 amplifer , power spply works great no more battaries to buy just the electic company I needed a dependable system and the power supply wil do the trick thx"
2,Non-returnable,"It seemed legit, but I ended up not needing it. I was unable to return it so now I'm out $10. Thanks."
3,Some things to be aware of...,"I bought this expecting it to be the same as the standard size Christian Prayer book, except for the font size. There are a couple of significant differences. It comes with only 3 ribbons vs. 5 in the standard version. Also, and more importantly, the rubrics are not in red - all the text is in black."
5,Just what was wanted,This is perfect. Soft cover and large print makes it a pleasure to handle and use. Would high recommend to anyone.
5,The most comprehensive treatment of the subject.,"I have found Michael Hesemann's book to be the most comprehensive and serious treatment of the subject. If you are new to the subject, start with this book, you'll get an excellent history of the ufo phenomenon. There is information in this book that I've not read anywhere."
5,Best gift for a rocky fan,What you see is what you get! My sister is the biggest Rocky Horror fan and when I saw this I thought it was the best gift ever. It is a great size and is worth every penny. It has a body shape looks just like a rubber duck. It came very quick. I love the item and the Seller.
5,Fit as described.,One of the other posters actually measured and described the cushion which made it really nice to size it up before buying. Look around at the other reviews.The cushion fit my H51 headset great and hasn't been a problem.
4,Good,"Good.was what I expected and fit my needs, yes yes yes yes, I hate filling in words for no reason."
4,Didn't work for me.,"The item was exactly as described by the reviewers. They seem to be good quality and I'm sure they work if you get the right size. Only 4 stars because the company or Amazon could have a better listing of what size it will stretch to. I bought thinking it would stretch more than it does. Here is what did not work:I have the egg shape headphones. The common kind you see in a lot of automobiles.My headphone speaker:75mm x 60mm (the width being the widest part of the ""egg""The pads seen here:57mm wide (38mm inner hole)Stretching the pads to near tearing gets the inner hole to about 70mm and that's just stretching one way. I don't believe it would be usable on a speaker of 70mm. Realistically these might work on 60mm round speakers.Hope this helps."
2,Bigger isn't always better,These Plantronics Ear Cushions are too big for my headset earpiece. The may stay on but are sloppy and float around on the earpiece.
3,Too small,"I'm sure on the right size headphone, they work great, but they were no good for us. I'd measured the headphones based on numbers provided here in the comments, and I thought the cushions would fit. I'd expected that they would be able to stretch enough to go over the longer sides since my headphones are more oval-shaped than round. But the 1st cushion tore when we tried to stretch it. We attempted the 2nd one j.i.c. but gave up before that one tore as well."
1,Wrong size,"Wrong size cushions! Maximum round size diameter earphone they would fit is 1.75"". No size listed in product description: my bad, since I believed the 1st reviewer who said it fits ""Maximum Round Size Diameter = 2.75"" or 6.985 cm,"" which was exactly what my earphone size was. Totally wrong information, probably for a different product: these cushions are less than 1.5"" I.D., and the maximum round size diameter earphone they would fit is 1.75"" - a full inch less than the reviewer said. The O.D. is only 2.125""! I'll take the $2.64 loss; especially since they arrived by Fedex at my rural address in a 1 ft x 1 ft x 1/2 foot box, when a small envelope via USPS would have sufficed. Incredible!"
4,They work!,"My husband needed new ear cushions for his plantronics head set. At first we thought they were going to be too small, but because they are foam, the worked really well - served their purpose - and were WAY less expensive than buying a brand new head set for him! I would say if you have a plantronics head set, and you need new ear cushions for it, try these out."
5,Perfect Fit,Fit my original equiptment perfectly. Low cost and arrived in just a few days. Much less expensive than ordering from my corporate supplies department.
3,"Cushion Dimensions Please (2 1/8"")","As with other reviewers of these foam cushion products I have found that the package dimensions don't indicate in any way the real size of the cushions inside. These are 2 1/8"" and I was hoping for 3"". I hope the sellers decide to give the real dimensions of these items in the future."
5,Do It All If You Can,Now Pastor Hayden and I are real good friends but I don't go to shiloh.But I watch or order tapes.Boy Pastor hayden will preach Billy Graham out of his under wear.He will sing Paul Morton to his knees and boy he will pray until his awnser plus comes.Shilohs' chior can show nuf' sang.Boy If you can stir a childs spirit then you got a gift.As a matter of a fact he's my mentor.That's why I started Crenshaw Christian Center Temple.But He'll sing if he has to by himself.But sunday evening I'm not the only one shouting or crying.He is a miniture life size minus miracle working and sinless twin Jesus
5,A great title at a great price,"This game is a masterpiece, whether you are into adventure, espionage, or action, also this will show you a true cinematic experience.This game has everything you need to keep you entertained, if you have been following the series the you are not even reading this, but if you haven't this game is some serious fun for everyone, even those not familiar.The only downside is that this game focuses on stealth and some people might not be to patient to move on the exact moment, or wait for a soldier to get distracted, but if you try it you might surprise your self on how addictive the game is.And now with a true bargain price, Greatly recommended. Don't miss it."
3,A good first person shooter,This is an OK game. I wish you were able to fight more when in close quarters with the enemy. When you get too close to someone and they see you; you are unable to punch them in the face. Other than that...if you have 32 hours to kill....you can beat the game without the help of cheat codes.
5,one of the best games i have ever played,"I have to agree with The Rev on his review. I think most of the people that wrote anything just babbled on about the killing and what not. I for one watched, listened, and read every word to that game. They were trying to take the story much deeper than just the upfront missions. I am glad someone else got the message too. To get the full experience you have to actually watch all the cinematics and pay attention. I know alot of people just skip through them in games because they can get lengthy. Quite often you can predict what they are going to show or say, but I was suprised with this game. Take the time to watch them and there is alot of humor in this game as well. Some of it is just not always shoved in your face, you have to search and play around some. Josh"
5,One of the greatest games ever,"In Metal Gear Solid three we see a U.S. spy dropped into the Russian forest in order to save a rocket scientist that wants to defect to the U.S. during the Cold War. This is by far one of the greatest games ever made when it come to all aspects of game making. Whether it be the astounding graphics, the superb narrative, or the expertly written story that contains many scenes that will conjure up emotions like no other game has before. MGS3 contains many game play improvements over the previous MGSs and will keep you on the edge of you seat with some of the most intense action ever seen on a game console, I give it my highest recommendation and suggest that anyone with a PS2 should pick this up right away. It is amazing."
5,one of the greatest MGS games,"sure it is a new aspect to the MGS genre... but it takes place before the other metal gear solid games... back in the 60's when the cold war began and the use of ""spies"" were being used...this game really gets you thinking about your surroundings, and your effectiveness in survival and combat training.the controls of the game are a little different at first but they are very easy to master and to execute some of the CQC(close quarter combat) moves.i would definitely recommend this game... but seeing how metal gear solid subsistence is now out... your better off buying MGS:S if you want more content then the original. More content in online play and new scenes and a library of cinematic and future metal gear games."
5,Awesome light!,"I'm a refrigeration technician. That means I'm in dark places all the time. I bought this light over a year an a half ago. I have gone through 2 bulbs in that time. It still holds a charge, well it has never died on me. I charge it next to my bed just about every night. It is really bright. I can also put it on my AR-15 if I want:)"
5,One of the best flashlights I've ever owned,"I bought this light to replace one that I had for 5 years but lost. I am a police officer and this light fits perfectly on my duty belt. I do not need to carry a bulky Maglight or other large flashlight. The Streamlight is much brighter also. It fits well in the hand and the beam can pierce the darkness with ease. The light comes with 2 chargers which is great if I want to recharge from home or from my car. I frequently get 2 weeks between charges with normal use. If the light stays constantly illuminated, the charge lasts for about an hour. I would not hesitate to recommend this light to anyone. Being a police officer that works steady nights, I rely on this light to help protect my life. It does the job perfectly and hasn't let me down."
1,Save your money,Badly organized. Poor illustrations and instructions. Quite possibly the worst exercise book I've ever owned.I will donate this to the library next trip so at least I can get 50% of the face value as a tax deduction.
4,Great for beginners!,"The book has a nice set of beginner, intermediate, and advance workouts, but if you use it regularly it won't last more than six months. Nevertheless, I think it is a good start."
5,Best Book Ever,"I have purchased many books and DVDs for home exercise and this is by far the best book. It is well organized--I love the little pictures for each exercise in the routines--they give you a ""hint"" so you can do the exercise without having to look it up in the book (once you learn it). The exercises are easy and affective. I would highly recommend this book for home exercise using the stability ball."
5,Still makes me laugh!,I've been a fan of Martin & Lewis since I was a kid. I recently purchased this item and found myself still cracking up at their antics!
