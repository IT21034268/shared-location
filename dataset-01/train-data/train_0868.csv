3,B+ Music,"Not quite as good as Distance and Time or Sort of Revolution, but decent on it's own. If you're die hard Fink fan, you will enjoy this."
4,versitile performer,"I like the versitility of a Warren (triangular) hoe. It's great for weeding, edging and furrowing."
5,Aptly titled...,"Any blues or R&B aficianado should own this collection! All the performances are stellar, and why isn't that cover of ""Good Rockin' Tonight"" with Sweet Alice Hoskins, Dallas Moore, and the virtuoso guitarist Chuck Morpurgo on every IPOD in America? Truly as grinding as ""Sweet Home Chicago."""
5,The Rosetta Stone of Rock-n-Roll,"This is it my friends. If you only can afford one Elvis album, this is one to get. What you will hear here is why Elvis is the King. His blending of white country with black R & B and gospel is what you will hear in it's absolute purest and rawest form. Whether you're black or white, country or redneck - Elvis Presley will always be The King of Rock-n-Roll.Thankyouthankyouverymuch."
5,Why Elvis is Elvis,Why Elvis is Elvis - this cat could sing and here's the proof! Give this a spin and you'll understand how he became the KING!
4,Love the Book and The Cards!,I've been working with these for months now. I really like the cards and have found them to be a wonderful tool for meditation and contemplation. The artwork on the cards is beautiful. The book is incredibly detailed and fascinating. The spreads and technique are very interesting. I've also found a way to incorporate them into a past life tarot spread I like to use.
5,Rich in History,"The Phoenix cards are bright and hypnotic to look at and mull over. The book is a thorough and detailed exposure to a part of the world and a specific society as they once existed. Try reading not only yourself, but those closest to you. You will likely find numerous similarities in the time periods you and your family and friends are drawn to. It's especially fun to find out what children, who are not yet as exposed to history that could affect their conscious choices, select."
4,Phoenix Cards;,"Seller did a fine job. Mistake was mine--thought I was ordering the deck, not the book."
2,Not worth it,I found this deck very limiting after the first use. If you want to know more about your past lives I'd recommend regression hypnosis instead.
3,"Interesting, but not invaluable","Psychoanalytic Case Formulation provides some insight on the manner by which the analytic practitioner assesses a patient. Assessment of defenses, affects, self-esteem, identifications, and relational patterns are just some of the topics covered. However, the sections on the ""clinical implications"" of findings in each area are brief and leave the reader wanting more. The book could be much more valuable (like its predecessor, Psychoanalytic Diagnosis) had there been a greater focus on relating findings more clearly and thoroughly to the actual work of therapy."
4,Good Retrofit Dust Collection System,"I have been impressed with this dust collection system. It was easy to install and works well on my 6"" dia. orbital sander. Though some dust still escapes, it is a dramatic improvement over letting the dust fill your work area. On the other end I use a 6.25 peak Shop-Vac QSP Pro and a Sears automatic power switch, which automatically turns the shop vac on when you start the sander. One note of caution, this dust collection system does make the sander harder to hold onto, especially when you are using just one hand."
4,Good for PC tools,"I bought this to use with my Porter Cable circular saw and biscuit joiner. PC has a non-standard size (1"") O.D. connector on its handheld power tools that won't work with standard vacuum hoses. This kit comes with an adapter to size up to 2-1/2"" but since I don't hook it up directly to the vac, I plan on buying a 2-1/2"" coupling from Lowes to connect it to my 2-1/2"" hose. Together, they're really easy to hook up and suck about 50-70% of the dust. It's length and flexibility really help as well."
3,Corrections to previously posted review,"Martin's father was a Calvinist (not Lutheran) minister, and the work is scored for 7, not 6 string instruments - 2 violins, 2 violas, 2 celli & double bass - and piano. My apologies for these errors (which have been corrected in the original review)."
1,This DVD was horrible!!!,I thought Fat Joe was going to make this a master peice but was I wrong. This is a low budget DVD that I was upset I purchased.
1,this is [worthless],"This is one of the worst movies I'v ever seen, and I wouldnt reccomend it to someone I hated. I only bought the movie for one reason, Cuban Link, and he was barely in it. Everyone else are TERRIBLE as actors and Link is the only one that can really act, which he barely gets the chance to do. DONT see this movie."
1,not a rap movie,"This movie is [not good] it was nothing at all like fatjoe's other film Thicker than water which was very good. This film has a awful plot, and it also has some karate in which I thought was dumb for this type of film. There was a guy who looked like billy blanks wannabe. I also thought that it would have been more focused on the rappers in the film but instead it was about some stupid kids who somehow know karate, and the girls mom is 60 years old and she tries to be a major drug dealer, and her daughter is a crackhead who can't act or sing. It isn't worth to even get on bootleg or to rent dont let the cover fool you it is not worth your time. I gave it to one of my friends and he said it was extermely stale."
2,Not For Me,"I suppose these bars are nutritionally sound, but I found the taste lacking, the satisfaction wanting, the crispness crispy. The chocolate coating tasted artificial, almost bitter. There wasn't much of a peanut butter taste in there either. Don't think I'd want these again. To each his/her own."
3,Lacks code examples for a definitive guide,"This book is good if you have no idea what Ant is about. The book lacks creative code examples, and doesn't explore many things that Ant is capable of doing. The book should be called ""Ant the Definitive Introduction"". I think the Ant Developer's Guide does a better job of touching into the depth of Ant's capability. However, the book would be very good for an Ant newbie."
2,Best for reference,"This book will teach you the basics of Ant, however not all the examples are complete. Some subjects are taught by examples which are only snippets of code, something key is missing. A new tag or attribute has been introduced and you have no idea what it is. Sometimes you can figure it out by googleing the error and using the Ant error messages, but too often you can't. This is probably better as a book for experienced Ant users rather than those like myself who want to really learn Ant well."
2,Definitive? I'm not so sure.,"This book is basically a rehash of the product docs that come with Ant. There are some examples included, but for the most part, there isn't any information in this book that can't be gleemed from the documentation.If you are someone that likes to printed examples available, then this book will be useful. The examples seemed to be fairly well formed and complete (although not all the complex topics are covered in adequate detail).Ohterwise, if you are looking for a Ant reference that will cover complex examples, and include strategies for using the tool properly, look elsewhere."
1,Yes a useless one,"1. Most of it are just taken from online docs2. It does not deal with any of the advanced stuff like dependency management etc. ( part of it could be due to the old version of ant used )3. The worst part is that, it is not very friendly for a user. 80% os the book is dedicated to showing the java APIs used to implement ant ( that too like a cut paste manner ), rather than showing the xml syntax that a user will use.Yes its a waste. Buy the Erik Hatcher, Steve Loughran book which is the only good one available."
1,The Definitive 'Waste of Money',"Considering all the Ant build possibilities, this book barely scratches the service. Half the book is nothing more than the API in alphabetical order. I would have liked to see examples that incorporated the optional Ant jar (JUnit), complex EJB builds, deployment on 3rd party application servers like Weblogic, and strategies dealing with multiple wars but these were no where to be found. It would have been nice if there was more discussion on best practices. In addition, the book is poorly written and reads like it was written overnight.This book should be titled ""An introduction to Ant and nothing more."" I only wished that I saved my receipt. Go read 'Java Development With Ant'. It is far more comprehensive and 'Definitive'. At first I gave this book 2 stars but after reviewing 'Java Development With Ant' I realized this book was more lacking than I thought. Don't make the same mistake I did!"
2,"Again, Hatcher/Loughran","Hatcher & Loughran's Java Development with Ant blew this book out of the water. I would rather have just went with the online docs than this book, but Hatcher & Loughran is way more than the online docs."
2,What a shame,"Its a shame, but this book is a real piece of junk. I don't know how long it took the authors to write, but it reads like it was thrown together in a frantic hurry. It also covers an older (1.4.x) version of Ant. Even worse a lot of this information is available from the Ant docs. To be fair this book does give you the basic information about how to use Ant, but it is far from a ""definitive guide."" Hatcher's book is much better even though its published by Manning."
4,"the vampire files, vol one","If you enjoy the supernatural, this book is better than average. I found it to be different than other books on the supernatural because of the fact that he is a Private Investigator."
2,Okay but Dated,"Went back and tried rereading some of these stories. Wish I had kept my memories. This isn't terrible or anything like that. It is okay. The writing is very formula and certain to appeal to the formula driven magazines and readers. Once upon a time, it was original. Now, the genre has moved on. I'm hoping she has improved in her new books. Her books are in all the libraries so it would probably be a good idea to check those out before starting to build a library. For somebody who is living in the world she created, these flaws are probably not that important. Save your cash to spend on one of the many good new writers with fresh material."
3,Be sure to look inside the book first,"I made the big mistake of only looking at the table of contents instead of looking inside the actual chapters of the book. I am preparing to do a lesson for a Bible class, and I was looking for some books with good commentaries on these Biblical couples. This book did not do that. It gives you a very brief overview, and then goes into the lesson questions. This is fine if you are in a group study and you can share answers to the questions. But if you are looking for a deep study on these couples, this is not the book. On the up side, the price was great, and I might go back and complete the self study later."
3,Future book lacks Description of Future,"If you are looking for a book that will suck you in, look no further; this book will keep you reading as you cook, eat, and . . . well, you get the idea. Though Dole's writing style is unique, if you are hoping to have a futuristic society painted in your mind, this is not the book for you. As I read my mind continually racked my knowledge of Star Trek, Blade Runner, The great comic book Transmetropolitan, Farhenheit 451, The Martian Chronicles, and The Fifth Element. Is this future dark and dirty or bright and colorful? Is there smog? Food in pill form? Are there bars? Chicken Wings? Libraries? Art? What is this ""Camp"" and why did our protagonist go? How are babies made? Dole has given us about 50% of what could have been an excellent science-fiction novel. His writing style provocative and story-line original and human, all it needed was an undertanding of the society's workings and Tangerinephant's relationship to it."
1,"Good for statistics, horrible for explaining.",I had to read this book for my sociology class and googling the topics helped explain them better than the book did.
1,Not as described,"Warning - this product is only the seat and ropes - it DOES NOT include the frame, even though it doesnt clearly state this.This is very, VERY expensive compared to other seats out there - although, when I looked at it, it seemed very sturdy and quality-made.Just take note about the lack of frame - this is the same as the other cheaper swing seats that is just a seat and rope.Sending it back and getting the Little Tikes castle swing set and slide for only $20 more!"
1,Don't Waste your money!!!!,I agree with the member above.I thought that the item was the full set as shown in the picture and not just the seat.The quality is no better than a seat for a third of the price.Get the Little Tikes Swing that is on here for $25!I feel mislead and ripped off! Returning this immediately!
1,Very Dissapointed,I was very dissapointed when the swing arrived. It is just the seat and rope itself. It is 3 times the price for the same thing. It should have specified that the frams was not included. Returning it immediately.
2,Always knew Nurses were smarter than doctors!,"This might be okay for some, but the fact is it's way too basic and limited. If you rely on it too much you're going to find yourself being escorted out your program. Too many former nursing classmates of mine used this book and they ended up failing the class, just be careful and stick with the textbook. (What the heck is farmacology??)"
1,Very poorly edited mistitled video,This is one of the worst videos I have purchased. The video itself is poor quality with some of the scenes appearing to have been shot with a camcorder. The voice over is appalling and sounds like it has been put together in someones bedroom with second hand equipment. Some of the scenes have nothing to do with fights at all and are totally irrelevant to the title of the video itself.
2,Too shallow.,"Weak script and story line. Acting was OK. Some funny parts but overall, there are far better films in the market."
3,What is it about Jenna Elfman?,"I've become increasingly tired of Richard Dreyfuss' performances - beginning with the ""Opus"" film. Yawn. But even though Dick played this movie the way he always has - the same as all the others - I found that as he played off the Elfman foil, I actually began to enjoy myself.Jenna Elfman needs to be watched very closely. I'm pretty sure that everything she does is funny. Keep watching, and she'll wear you down to the point that you've been soundly entertained."
1,One of the 10 worst movies ever made.,"The premise of this movie, involving a hairbrained anthropology professor, a lusty grad student, some misappropriated grant funds and a completely invented tribe of New Guineans, is clever. Unfortunately, this movie (pardon what I'm about to say) chews up a good idea and regurgitates it onto the screen. The plot and directing is completely implausible from start to finish. The depiction of native New Guinean tribes is utterly fake, silly and Hollywoodized and, frankly, treats native peoples in an offensively stupid manner. The contrived comedic situations are almost never funny. I chuckled once or twice, but most of the time stared in disbelief at the poor taste and childishness of it all. This in spite of the fact that it has two very skilled actors. Which proves a timeless truth -- actors and their agents are almost always terrible judges of both scripts and directing. Unless you suffer from the same flaw, you will not enjoy this movie."
4,HILARIOUS!,I EXPECTED THIS MOVIE TO BE A BORING FAMILY FILM. BOY WAS I WRONG! I LAUGHED FROM BEGININNG TO END. JENNA ELFMAN AND RICHARD DREYFUS ARE HILARIOUS.I I LOVED IT.
3,Nothing Wide about this Screen,"This is a great DVD movie for all, but especially anthropologists and other university types as it shows Dreyfuss' characther doing what he can to keep his grants and his prestigious job. It is indeed ""hysterically funny"" and ""wildly hilarious"" as the covers say and despite its lack of extras is a fine disc so rush out and buy it and...Wait, there's one little problem...WHERE'S THE WIDESCREEN? The back specs say Widescreen, so why is it FullScreen? Granted, the 'home movie' film clips would be difficult to render Wide, but still, why say it is when it is not. Very disappointing, which is why I give it only 3 stars and suggest being careful if that is what you want, otherwise, enjoy. Also, if your looking for another movie like this, check out Joe Versus the Volcano with Tom Hanks."
4,Just thought I should mention...,"I read this book several years ago, when I was 7 or 8 I think... it was very, very good, but it did kind of freak me out at that age."
5,A Childhood Favorite!,I read this book over and over as a kid. I would highly recommend it for any child. I think even boys will connect with Bindi's struggles to do the right thing and be captivated by the Tiki's rebellion against the evil queen!
5,A fabulous book for both boys and girls!!!,"I am a mom of an 8 year old girl and 5 year old boy. I first read ""The Fairy Rebel"" to my children, and then two chapters at a time (once a week) to my 8 year old's class. Both boys and girls loved it!!! They always wanted more, more, more!!! (how very like humans!) Terrific book, clear examples of good and evil, with good winning, of course. A lovely book; I recommend it to all teachers and parents."
5,The Best Book I have Read In Months: The Fairy Rebel!,"This book is a wonderful book about a woman who cannot bear birth to a child. She discovers this small, chubby fairy (Tiki) who is ""earthed"" on her foot.The fairy then grants a wish of bearing a child, which she could get in trouble for doing favors for humans by the Fairy Queen. The woman soon meets Tiki's friendWijik, who is an elf and who also caused Tiki to be ""earthed"". Later in the story, Wijik finds Tiki missing and tells the woman and her husband. The presumptionsof Tiki's disappearance ran high in their minds while looking for her.This book is a MUST READ. I give it a ***** in the Story line, ***** in the Interest Line, ***** in the Character line, and ***** overall.Buy it -- you won't be sorry!!- Sarah Klaren"
4,it will leave a smile on your face,"I can hardly remember most of this book,I read it last year.The #1 thing I remember is that I felt enchanted after I read the book.It was a great book.It took me a day to read it,it took my classmates 3 weeks to read it.It was a great book and if you're a fantasy lover you're bound to love this book."
4,Review on THE FAIRY REBEL,"I really liked this book, most of it anyway. The story was well woven, with characters I could connect with. I really love books about fairies, and this one was unusual. I haven't read a fairy book before where there is a tyrannical fairy leader, and the fairies are in some ways restricted in how they live.The only slightly downside of this book was the slightly confusing plot at the end."
5,Used to own this when I was little,Loved this book then and my daughter loves it now. So happy to have found it again. Worth reading over and over.
2,Silly Story,"The reviews I read for this book must have caused me to expect something great. In actuality, the storyline was weak the characters were flat, and the overall effect was unsatisfying. There are some truly fantastic young people fiction stories out there, but this is not one of them."
2,Worst Frankowski book I've read,"I've read all but one Of Leo Frankowski's books, and I've liked them enough that I buy anything new that he writes without thinking twice. But the last two that I have read (The War With Earth and The Fata Morgana) have been far less enjoyable than than the rest.A Boy and His Tank (now renamed: Kren of the Mitchegai) was a much better book (apart from teh ending, which no one likes). So don't just go out and buy this book because you liked that one.My main complaint with this book is that (as other reviewers have pointed out) everything goes so unbelievably in the main character's favor that you read the entire book thinking that the whole thing is just a ""dream"". Everything just comes too easy.This book just wasn't worth the time to read it. Go buy a different Frankowski book instead."
5,Very Enjoyable Military SF Light Entertainment,"The previous reviewers tend to either love or hate this book. I fall into the love it category. I have read most of the better known military SF by authors such as David Weber, Elizabeth Moon, John Ringo, S.M. Stirling, etc., and I think that if you like those authors, you will probably like this book.It is definitely is a little juvenile at times, but take it for what it is."
1,Simply Awful.,"I am a fan of military sci-fi (particularly David Weber and John Ringo). I have never reviewed a book for Amazon before but this book was so bad that I felt compelled to share my opinion with other readers of the genre. How bad is it? It hurts to read it! The characters are caricatures and the story is full of so many stereotypes that it is silly. There is no suspense to the story and no sense of danger in the plot. If I could give it ""no stars"", I would. Don't waste your time or money on this one."
3,room for improvement,"to be honest the only reason i bought this doll was because its labelled a jamaican barbie. I love barbie dolls and i am a jamaican so i had to have it.However I do not like the costume. it is not a traditional jamaican costume. I would have preferred to see her wearing a kind of red plaid skirt with a white blouse with plaid trimmings and plaid bandanna or straw hat, maybe holding a basket. The outfit this doll is wearing just looks like a regular dress a slave would wear back in slavery days. The back of the package box says that most jamaicans have ancestors from africa ,and Im glad it specified the word' most ' because the jamaican motto is ""out of many one people"" There are jamaicans with indian,chinese,and caucasian background as well. And for heavens sakes ackee dos not taste anything like eggs, if you want to describe how it looks then you can compare it to scrambled eggs. I like the fact that a jamaican barbie was created ,but i think there is room for improvement."
3,Good bike for the price.,The handbrake is impossible to use. An adult would have a hard time pulling the handbrake enough to get the bike to stop. My 5 year old cannot use it at all. The coaster breaks work fine so this is not a huge issue. The bike was simple to put together. My daughter loved the colors and decorations. It is a decent transition bike for when the kids are growing quick.
1,Fantasy Gypsies once again,"Despite her having been ""inspired by Rom Gypsy culture and her experiences as a human rights activist"" Ms. Spiegler has added yet another title to the long list of Tolkienesque ""Gypsy"" novels which serve only to perpetuate an other-worldly image that detracts from Roma as a real people facing real problems."
4,You should probably own this,"I don't exactly remember how I heard of the Poster Children, and I don't know what compelled me to buy this album. Probably some inaudible voice in my head. Well that voice was right on, because this album is one of the best I have picked up in a long time. This is mostly a batch of pop songs smeared with punk, noise, rock, and funk. The first song, ""This Town Needs a Fire"" will make you want to put skid marks on your ceiling, while ""Zero Stars"" is a punk-ish tune tailored to late night car chases. ""Judge Freeball"" and ""Peck n' Paw"" are two energetic instrumentals. The rest of the songs are just plain catchy, upbeat, raucous, two or three minute bursts of adrenalized sonic tornadoes. Even though I don't review albums for a living (and thus don't get infinite amounts of free promotional CDs from record labels), I would feel safe betting that this album could be one of the best of the year. Yes, you should probably own this album."
2,"""Providential"" means no explanations","A very embarrassing book because it really tells us nothing wewant to know. What was it like growing up Jewish in wartime Hungary?Just a few inconveniences. Why did he become a priest? Not a word about belief in anything? Why did he leave the Church? Just seemed the best thing to do? How did he become a leading scholar of the Dead Sea Scrolls and of Jesus as a ""Jew."" Quite by accident. There isn't an answer to any real question here. But there is a lot of self-serving prose and a general attack on two centuries of Christian scholars who have found the capturing of the ""historical Jesus"" a difficult if not impossible task. For Vermes, it is pretty easy to get to the historical Jesus; all you have to do is to realize he was a first-century Jew!..."
4,"Avion - great graphics, good MMO.","Avion - great graphics, good MMO. Game system shows few significant bugs after completion of the Beta testing. One major early problem were the servers, this issues was resolved and I am seeing no problems at this time. Avion appears to have adopted the best ideas from earlier MMOs, accually not a bad starting point. I specifically enjoy the new idea of individual flying skills as a major element of the game play."
5,COH is SHUTTING DOWN,This is written in fair warning NOT to purchase time cards for this game as it is shutting down. I have purchased two of them so I could go VIP and I received them on Sept 1st. I tried going online and getting them activated but to no avail. They said it was valid on the code numbers but to use them on another game. Well their two other games are free and dont need a time card. On Sept. 18th they wrote and said they stopped taking any more vip's on Sept 1st the same day I recieved them. I am hoping Amazon will let me send them back as I can't use them. So if you play COH enjoy it as it is .... because it is closing on Nov. 30th...and alot of people have already left. Thank you for responding to me.
1,NCSoft doesn't deserve your money,Give your money to a publisher that values you and their own product. NCSoft doesn't deserve your money and it will only break your heart when it closes your game and your characters are taken from you.
1,NCSoft: MMO Killers,"NCSoft is a horrible company to deal with, they have a long history of canceling successful MMOs and leaving fans out cold. MMOs are a great social experience and they become a significant part of the player's life. If you value those aspects, then don't look at anything published by this company. Sooner than later they WILL cancel the game on you."
1,When Will We Hear Something New???,"I bought this CD because of a friend's recommendation, who I used to trust, but never again. This cd is the worst in a long line of sorry, wannabe neo-soul ""singers"" that think reciting lame-ass poetry over ripped off funk riffs and hip-hop classics is grounds for music. Don't get me wrong - some of the tracks are tight but they are all ultimately ruined by the overbearing montone voice of the lead ""singer"". Get a grip buddy. It sounds like you are trying to be D'Angelo but just come off as a watered down Erika Badu."
2,BAD Max,"MAX MAX (Australia-1979) is a fine action movie. This videotape however is NOT recommended.VIDEO TREASURES dubbed their VHS's at speeds slower than SP (usually LP). Thus, video quality is somewhat degraded. Audio tracks are linear, not HiFi, which also limits fidelity.Seek out MAD MAX on a reliable studio release!"
3,Ireland's Tourism will suffer IF the ghosts have any say about....,"Convoluted shenanigans about a man killed for all the wrong reasons.The IRISH surroundings are a nice diversion from a plot that has masked cultists,ghosts,treachery dealing with mothering children with a dark secret.The gunplay was very well done and felt like real jeopardy was about to befall the innocent."
2,Don't waste your time or effort,"Quite simply a bad movie and not even worth the rental. Should have gone directly to Amazon Prime for free viewership for those members and even then I doubt if most viewers would have watched the entire affair.I watched every second because I screwed up and spent money for the ""honor"" of watching the movie. Thank goodness it wasn't very much money but a nickle is too much for garbage like this."
4,it's a okay toy,"I really enjoy this toy. But the price is to much, it should be $7.99. The car is really fun and it's easy to handle the parts. I bought 2 of them for christmas for me and my brother."
3,Mimics the real thing,"I found this kit to be pretty close to the real thing.There are a number of very large components - wings, nose-cone, engine cover/tunnels - that are single pieces. Like a real Formula car, they lift on and off as a single piece. This somewhat hampers the reuse - about all those pieces are good for are building a racecar or a race-car derivative - (a really fast landspeeder anyone....) - but they are beautiful and I think this is an easy kit to build. The components under the ""preformed"" components are the normal Megabloks and thus easily reused/combined with other bricks."
1,TRASH,THIS TRASH DOES NOT WORK ON MY DOG @ ALL. BUYER BEWARE.. GAVE AS DIRECTED BUT DOES NOT WORK AS STATED
2,Hyper dog..,I have a year old Schnauzer that is very hyper. I tried it several different times of the day and even doubled the recommended dosage and it did not work for my Schnauzer. So I still have a very hyper dog!
3,Helps my dog home alone,"i bought this initially for my 12 lb terrier's travel fear. This calms him, but he would still puke in the car. So, I decided to try to use this for his separation anxiety instead, and it works quite well. Instead of howling for hours home alone, he chills out most of the time instead.UPDATE: This doesn't seem to work consistently. It will work one day, but not the next day, and might work 3 days later. I don't really get it."
2,Calming Tablets,My dog can not stand these. Sorry the taste cannot even be hidden in her food. So have to say NOT on these. She has had others she tolerates. Also as far as they work once I got them down her was ok but I have had better ones for her and they are cheaper..
4,How to clean this disc,Use an ice pick and a wire brush. Chip off the gummed up paint with the ice pick and then brush off the remaining paint. You don't even need to remove the disc from the machine. Keep your icepick handy.Forget mineral spirits and soaking and changing discs all day. Just chip off the paint and get back to work.Under heavy use the discs wear out in about 4-8 hours of use.(note: I post my reviews because I take them seriously and I take other people's seriously as well. Please take the time to rate my review so I can do a better job in the future. Thanks :) ).
3,the wait was too long,"the cd was a gift and the recipient loved it, but he had to wait about 3 months for. It took a little too long."
4,Not what you'd expect from a a petite little blond....,"A picture and profile of Kiley Dean may misguide you. Kiley has sung back up for Britney Spears and has lovely golden locks, so you might expect she is another wave off pop princess knock offs. Not so at all, as she proves herself in the studio that she is anything but. Under the shield of Timbaland, Kiley as amerged with smooth, flavorful vocals to styling of Tweet. Kiley is very comfortable with music, everything just flows.""Make Me A Song"", an Aaliyah lyric-sampled song, is a clanky shot of hip-hop backed with a creamy R&B; undertone. Kiley's vocals are very notable, (I have heard to other songs by her where her vocals shine even more), the song is sure to be a summer hit. Check her out, and then some when she comes out with her debut (""Simple Girl"" is the title as of now). Stardom for Kiley seems just upon the horizon."
4,El realismo mágico no tiene fronteras,"Con una gran soltura en el verso y un mucho ingenio, Lucena de Mois Benarroch nos pone en contacto con una realidad que desconocía de la población judía. Porque al igual que un occidental puede generalizar de chinos a quienes habitan en Oriente, o un ingles puede confundir a quienes compartimos el idioma español; existen varias escuelas y tradiciones judías construidas a lo largo de los largos siglos de exilio que este pueblo ha sufrido. En la forma de un milenario personaje, la tradición derivada de España ha ido desapareciendo por los que provienen del Centro de Europa. Mi único pero es el glosario y que no soy mucho para el realismo mágico. Por lo demás, 100% recomendado para quienes gustan de conocer de la historia y como la viven sus autores."
5,GREAT SHOE FOR WET RIDING!!!,"I USE THESE SHOES FOR RIDING BOTH MY MONGOOSE G3 AND GIANT TO WORK IN ALL TYPES OF WEATHER IN THE BAY AREA. I USE EGG BEATER PEDALS ON BOTH BIKES WITH EGG BEATER CLIPS WITH NO PROBLEMS. MY FEET STAY DRY AND WARM DAY AND NIGHT. A LITTLE PRICEY, BUT WORTH IT IF YOU RIDE ALL YEAR ROUND."
3,The best book on applicacation development modeling to date.,"If you've ever asked the question: Is there a great book that teaches an excellent methodology for analyzing real world workflow, and then designing the application that will implement that workflow into an application? I've found the book that answers that question.Workflow Modeling is the book. It is the best book on the subject that I have read to date, and I've read dozens. It teaches you how to build visual models that illustrate the workflow process, and shows how to implement the model into an application. Superb! But it before it goes out of print."
3,Good but not great,"I bought these screen protectors for an SLR camera screen. The plastic is thick and will be very durable, however the cardboard tool provided to smooth out the air pockets is flimsy and bend after one application. A hint, when cutting the plastic to the size of your screen, cut it 1/16 of an inch smaller that way when smoothing out the plastic to remove air bubbles you have a little extra room at the edges to adjust."
1,Woe Is She,A stunning work of breathtaking ineptitude. To compare this book to a romance novel (as some reviewers have) demeans romance novels. Why is the story told in third person? Probably because it was ghost-written by someone too ashamed to have his name attached to such sophomoric drivel.
3,It would be nice if the families of the murdered victims or an outreach for battered women received some of the $,"I went to high school with Karen and we were on drill team together. She was a very sweet, kind and loving young lady. She was innocent and trusting and met an evil creep who took her life. I miss her. She came from a beautiful Christan conservative family that loved her very much. When a victim's story makes a profit, it should be shared with the family or a victim outreach in the community. I am glad this criminal was caught and put away and can not terrorize any other families. May the Lord bring her family peace."
4,A Lesson Learned from a True Adventure,In this book Margie Danielsen has had the courage to relive her frightening experiences in being married to and helping the FBI capture her murderous husband. She weaves a fascinating tale of the dangers and emotional ups and downs she was subjected to during the whirlwind courtship and marriage to a superb con artist who also proved to be a murderer. Shes takes you through her by then ex-husband's trial where she finally was assured that justice really does win out. Her book kept me turning page after page(I was unable to put it down) eager to know what she would do next. It has a powerful message for all women to trust their instincts within any relationship and act on those instincts. I recommend this book as a good selection for your local book club.
3,Riveting but poorly written---,"I am halfway through the book and find I cannot put it down; I find this odd, because the book is so poorly written; it is written like a trashy romance novel; however, the content is fascinating. it is hard to believe that this woman who had so many clues which she ignored about this con man(duh), before she married him, could transform herself into an assertive woman who had the intelligence to find out the truth about him and put him away in jail where he belongs. If this book had been written by, lets say, Ann Rule, it would have been outstanding. I would recommened it, even though it isn't well written; the story is just too interesting to let that get in the way."
2,Interesting story...major flaws in the writing,"The story is exciting and suspenseful; the writing is melodramatic and weak. Ms. Danielsen had a good story to tell, but she did not tell it well. It resembles a soap opera...all that is missing is the music on cue. I could not understand why it was told in the third person. I really don't understand why Ms. Danielsen did not send her daughters to live with their father or other relatives as soon as she found out the truth about her new husband. It was disappointing that the book is so badly written since the story is so interesting."
2,Waste of time,Thought this was a poorly written book. I'm all about drama but this was just sappy. Talk about denial! That woman put not only herself but her children in an HORRIBLE situation because she just couldnt get it together! Would have been gone!!! I've read almost 100 true crime books and this is on the bottom of the list.
2,Not her best,"This collection of short fiction, on the whole, shows little of the wit and scholarship which characterize Willis' most popular works. The title story, about a time traveller exploring London during the Blitz, would have seemed original if the novel ""To Say Nothing of the Dog"" didn't cover that same material more winningly. (Get ""...Dog"" for sure; it's great.) The other stories see Willis trying her hand at the supernatural, at sci-fi updates of historic figures, coming-of-age vignettes, and nuclear apocalypse, etc. None of it was terrible, but none of it gave me the feeling of her novels ""Bellwether"" or ""Doomsday Book"" that I couldn't wait to share her with my reading friends. This collection is primarily of historical interest."
2,Great title story; others in this volume disappoint,"The first story in this collection shares its title with the book: ""Fire Watch"". That story may be the very best short science fiction work I have every read. Besides being a good story, there is depth to the ideas about history and life which go far beyond the plot.Having had such a wonderful experience with the first story, I found myself sorely disappointed with the rest in the volume. The other stories struck me as very odd with much less depth. Most were so odd in fact, that I did not get anything else out of them."
2,"Errors, errors & more errors!","I've only finished the first story in the book. However, constant errors have made my reading experience quite distracting; tons of missed punctuation & multiple misspellings. I'm not sure I'm going to invest my time to finish the book. I'm disappointed at having paid $6+ for this product. In the future I will check reviews more carefully to avoid similiar reading disasters. This is definitely a ""buyer beware"" circumstance."
4,Excellent collection from a top sf writer,"Connie is one of the best sf writers today, and these stories show why, from the moving (and award-winning) title story to the humorous ""Blued Moon"" (where an incineration project results in a permanent blue moon and a rash of coincidences) that show an elegance and range of writing styles and a depth of personal understanding. Sometimes I read something and think I can do just as well. I NEVER think that of Connie Willis."
3,"Wonderful stories, horrible digitization",These are great stories and the book itself merits 5 stars. But it looks as if the Kindle edition was done with sloppy OCR software. Multiple typos in every paragraph. Really irritating.
5,Glad this has been reprinted!,"This wide-ranging story collection is THE gift I give to friends when they wonder aloud whether imaginative literature can BE literature; it's both ""sf"" and ""terrific writing."" If you have read Willis' other work, this is her FIRST collection; the story ""Fire Watch"" was written before _Doomsday Book_ and has the first appearance of Kivrin. In addition to the Hugo-winning stories (""FW,"" ""Clearys"") _FW_ has many other treasures. Not everyone likes them all; ""Sidon"" is the one I can't figure out, while ""Lost & Found"" is my favorite, a haunting, standout story."
2,Not my favorite,"I recently read Willis' Blackout (which was phenomenal!) and was eager to read some of her older works. I picked up Fire Watch for Kindle and got to reading. The title story is mediocre at best. It was hard to follow and I wasn't loving it, but in the end, it's been one of the better stories. I believe I'm still deeply disturbed by ""All My Darling Daughters,"" and wish I had never read it.The Kindle version is riddled with typos. I is CCI in several spots, rn's are m's and so forth and so on, that it's extremely distracting and difficult to follow.Don't waste your money."
5,great book,"Fast shipping and the book came in perfect condition. This book really helped me to understand how things work. My professor suggested this reading and I think it helped. You do have to understand some basics before you read this book, but again it was a great aid."
5,wonderful,One of a kind. Well crafted. Aimless and organized at the same time. Occasionally noodles off and then becomes cohesive. Nice use of simple synthesizer sounds.
5,"The Big ""Thank You""","Bill Wiemersa has tackled some of the most destructive tendencies found throughout corporate America. The concept of ""telescoping"" not only applies in business relationshps, but I found that I also telescope many personal relationships. I predict this book and the concepts found in its pages will guide teachers, students, managers, executives, employees, spouses, siblings, coaches, politicians and ministers for many years to come. Can't wait to read the follow-up to The Big AHA......."
5,Big Thumbs Up From Hard-Core Numbers Guy,"""I'm a hard-core numbers guy...squishy 'business management' books justaren't my thing...at least that's what I thought The Big AHA would be.Was I wrong! The book was a wonderful surprise. It weaves common problemsencountered in the corporate world into a funny and entertainingnarrative, with wonderfully insightful advice throughout. AHA was an easyread and adelight, one that I can heartily recommend"".C.K. Woo"
5,A must-read for business and interpersonal success,"Bill Wiersma has written a very compelling and insightful book. I know I will be referring back to many marked pages to help me work through some particularly challenging work project scenarios, some of which I used to think were primarily driven by other people's behaviors. But now I can see how my biases contributed to the problem and, at times, the onus was all mine (horrors). Thanks for shedding some very important light on these aspects of emotional intelligence."
2,It would make a good article,"The author makes a very good point - we judge people initially and then subsequent experiences of those people are filter through the way we have judged them. He calls it ""telescopic vision."" The book offers good insights into why we do it, the damage it does in organizations, and that we should avoid it. But that's the book. A lot of words are spent giving examples and waxing on this point. There is so much more to conflict resolution than this."
5,The truth is enlightening...,"The truth indeed does set you free - and this book facilitates seeing how deceptive you can be with yourself, resulting in self-defeating behaviors. I confess to doing the things Bill describes. Without being pedantic, Bill has helped me see the error in some of my ways, and provided some tools to help me change them."
5,A Gift that Goes On Giving . . .,"I was reading The Big AHA (and having my own ""AHA"" epiphanies) at the same time I was deciding on a 10-year anniversary ""thank you"" gift for our clients. Many of the stories in the book resonated--both personally and professionally. So,I decided to send a copy of the book to 130+ of our accounting and law firm clients. I am still receiving thank you notes, several months later. It is very gratifying to hear clients tell their stories about their ""AHA"" moments during our coaching meetings and how they've made a real effort to catch themselves when they're having a negative, telescopic view of their colleagues and challenging clients. I have heard several touching stories about how the book has improved their relationships--not only with colleagues and clients, but also family members.Donna Bedford, President and Founder of The Bedford Group"
2,"Commercial breakthrough, artistic lowpoint","Here, for his first major label release, Rollins bottoms out. ""The End Of Silence"" explores all the worst aspects of ""Hard Volume"", meaning that long, slow, dirge like songs that plod along with no excitement whatsoever dominate the record.Only ""Low Self Opinion"" and ""Tearing"" show any signs of life and vitality at all. Rollins tries valiantly to carry the rest with his intensity, but falls short of his goal.If you're a fan of his sludgefests, then this CD is definitely for you, if not, then ""The End Of Silence"" isn't the place to start for novices..it's more like the place to finish."
1,the end of talent,"Holy cow does this cd suck. A recent article in a national newspaper indicated that Rollins had visited Australia 25 times. Makes you wonder who the hells forking out money over and over again. I can understand the speaking gigs getting an audience but his music is a dull wall of sound with as much melody as a 20 year old washing machine. Ten cd's or so of screaming angst with a few distorted echoes and a slight rap style every so often to appeal to god knows who else. Before making your next cd Rollins have a good stiff drink, and place a self imposed ban on yourself from posing in front of the mirror. Give me a smiths cd anyday!"
4,"henry's scream is vital, raw",Solid bass guitar riffs get the blood flowing on this diseased album. There is an incessant atmosphere of affliction and pain that is Henry's trademark. Nothing is ever satisfactory for this guy and that attitude is equally expressed in the music that his band plays. This is some dark stuff.
4,Porter Cable 97366 - worth the investment!,I won a Dewalt DW421 in a contest about 5 years ago. I traded it in and paid the difference to upgrade to this sander. The first 2 or 3 failed out of the box with motor and/or gear problems. After finding one that performed properly I put it to the test. I have used the 97366 with the dust collection system to sand cultured marble sinks and smooth walls that I had recently plastered. The dust was minimal while using my shop vacuum. It performs very good to excellent in sanding both soft and extreemly hard surfaces. This is one of the best investments I have made in my shop!
5,heavy duty,"this puppy is a smoking gun, in other words it's great!! heavy duty sander, fast and smooth. hook it up to your vac and cut down on the dust.. buy it!!"
2,"Hop, Skip and Jump","I was disappointed with the performance of the sander. It was difficult to control -- it usually hopped, skipped and jumped across the piece I was trying to sand unless I only used the edge of the disk. The sanding action was not as aggressive as I had hoped. I have pretty much reverted back to using my belt sander for rough sanding and my Dewalt ROS for the finish work. I also found the unit uncomfortable to hold. The vacuum hose seemed to be in the way. I actually wind up holding the vacuum hose and the screw-on handle while operating."
2,Forget this and Try Rigid ROS from Home Depot...,"PC 97366 has so much vibrations that I had to give it gift to my enemy.. Horrible... then within a week , I got a Xmas Gift of Home Depot Card and I used it to buy Rigit Sander from Home Depot for $139... ( I SAID , I CAN RETURN IT IF I DON'T LIKE IT )WHAT A SURPIRISE THEN... THE RIGID IS SUPREME SANDER WITH ZERO PAIN IN HAND AND AWESOME GERMAN BUILT ... GREAT BUILD QUALITY AND 3 YEAR WARRANTY... YOU CAN'T MISS THAT...I CANNOT BELIEVE HOW GOOD RIGID SANDERS ARE... BYE PORTER CABLE..."
5,This sander kicks a#s,I just finished sanding my oak kitchen floor with this sander and the sander worked flawlessly. It didn't bog down once after sanding all day. The dust collection and the H&L pad worked very well. One of the best tools I have purchased. It complements my PC 333VS sander.
2,Full of mistakes,"This text is based upon lecture notes (written either by Rota and then bound by Birkhoff or vice versa) and it is VERY apparant that the authors spent little time on checking for mistakes. It seems as though every fourth problem has a typographical error or is completely incorrect. This textbook does not take an intuitive approach to the subject and the many errors gives me reason to rate it low.Nothing is more frustrating to a student than to have a text make a claim, ask you to prove it, and then you find out the claim is false. This is not a unique occurance. Steer clear of this textbook."
1,Wout A Paddle Natures Calling,"This sucks so bad especially if your expecting one like the first one! I got it because it was filmed a couple miles from my house, so I was curious, especially because there was so much talk about ""low budget."" Yup, definately low budget!!!"
1,"Cannot Rate this movie - I ordered the wrong ""Without a Paddle: Natures calling"". I didnt want this one.","cannot Rate this show. I did not see it I just sent it back. I wanted ""Without a Paddle"" and I ordered this one by mistake. Sorry"
1,...Or a decent plot,"Yow!They obviously used the same script as the first, but threw out all the good bits (what there were). This is just a blow by blow repeat: same number of guys, 3, (instead of a doctor they made one of them a nurse), it also involved a road trip, also on a river, also in the woods, also trying to get a fire started, also needed fish for dinner, also about getting/finding money, also involved 2 tree huggers who also happened to be women and yes, there was also a hermit. And hooray, excrement was also involved! That, and 2 guys with guns trying to kill them. Deja vu, what are the odds? (I don't want to suggest plagiarism but if I wrote the script for the first movie and not the second, I'd sue.) This wasn't a sequel, this was a remake, and not a good one at that.And why the animated squirrels with knives!? Not to mention an animated humming bird with an attitude.So not funny."
1,Its a good thing I only paid 98cents for this movie,"The only good thing about this movie was Oliver James. He's hot and a good actor, thats the only way I made it through the whole movie. Although his use of an American accent was well done, I prefer his cockney-english accent (His natural accent). The movie left so many questions unanswered the scenes seemed scattered and unfinished. Most of the acting was awful (Except Oliver James, he was good)and the lines were poorly delivered. It sounded like they were reading lines directly from the script in a monotone voice. I can see why it went directly to DVD. The only thing I recommend watching this movie for is ""Man Candy"" Oliver James; other than that it may make a good coffee coaster"
3,My Girl/My Girl 2...,"I saw both these movies on Cable. Predictable, but fairly well acted fare. Fairly realistic view of life and relationships from the young Ms. Chlumsky's character. Dan Akroyd and Jamie Lee Curtis also star, but, it's Ms. Chlumsky's vehicle. Try to catch both movies on cable - Then go out and buy it - the early seventies live again in film!! Three stars for both!!"
5,A wonderful compendium of information,"A superbly written text available at a super price. Sums up much of what is known and not known about the coevolutionary process. Does a great job at explaining the theory and critical importance of symbiotic interactions to understanding general ecology and evolution. Also summarizes most of what he wrote about in his earlier books on this subject. The chapters range from the population level to large geographical scales. Three entire chapters on ""antagonists"" and three entire chapters on ""mutualists"". Good balance of theory and empirical examples. [Yes, I am an ecologist!] Highly recommended..."
5,Challenging my preconceptions...,"""Abraham, the Dreamer challenged my preconceptions of the akedah, awakened my sensitivities to the amazingly complex and all too human relations between members of Judaism's ""first family,"" and painted a picture of the historical, political, and sociological time and place in which this family lived.""Carol FelixsonEnvironmental education administratorLos Angeles, California"
2,highly disappointing after reading the reviews,"I just finished this book and went back again to read the Amazon.com reviews. I purchased the book, largely based on those reviews.I found this to be a moderately interesting story with poorly written dialog. The book itself is a slim offering, with many pages devoted to the author's self-promoting acknowledgements by others.I am highly disappointed by this book and am sorry I wasted the money to buy it."
5,Nutrisoda Calm Soda is perfect to calm those nerves!,"This is such an amazing product. I'm typically not the type of person who will run toward something that is all natural, but this soda had me curious. I have panic disorder and have found that in the middle of high anxiety or even an actual panic attack that this soda takes the edge off! I wouldn't believe it if someone had told me, but it is truly amazing. I don't leave the house without downing one of these sodas first and that's the truth. I get nervous leaving the house and this really helps me. I don't want to make this sound like it is some miracle cure all for panic and anxiety, but the combination of the ingredients is just perfect to calm me down. I really can't recommend this highly enough. If you suffer with anxiety/panic disorder, please try this soda."
4,good stuff!,"really good stuff! my favorite of the airforce Nutrisodas, even though they are all good."
5,Delicious non-cola low cal soda,"These airforce Nutrisodas are absolutely wonderful. ""Calm"" is but one of five or six other flavors that they offer, and is one of my favorites. These have no sugar or aspartame and have 0-5 calories each, their flavors are quite scrumptious, they aren't too bubbly, and the colors in a glass are truly gorgeous. I'm always dieting and love to pour them into a Riedel wine glass, and more than console myself that I'm not having wine with everyone else. They also mix well with hard liquor if you're into that--the nutrisoda website has a whole spiel on mixology that's quite amusing. Try the variety pack if you're curious about them all. If not, you can't go wrong with ""calm."""
1,Calm sent me to urgent care,my personal experince was that my blood pressure drop so much that end you calling in sick and going to urgent care. and this happened to my girl friend only she stay home and got a major headache.it only happened with Calm not with anyother product of [...]
5,Love this book,I purchased a hardcover version of this book for my children about twenty years ago. It is so amusing and full of Santa's life at the North Pole. Santa's favourite cookies recipe is yummy - these had to be made every Christmas. I totally recommend this book for anyone young at heart.
5,Absolutely the best Santa book ever published!,"Alden starts his book beautifully by telling, with superb imagination, the origin stories of the main characters in the book - Santa, Mrs Santa, the Elves, the creatures of the North Pole and of course the Reindeer. The author explains the mistique of Yuletide with the view of entertaining the child listener and adult reader. The questions that need answering are all handled in exquisite detail.The illustrations are as entertaining as the wit, in the many stories that Alden must have concockted oops... researched, in his numerous trips to the North Pole and personal interviews with the ""Big Fellow himself"".IT (Information technology)buffs will love the scientific explanations of; the flight of the reindeer, how a sleigh is loaded, what happens to non-believers, the Elvish language and their antics, coming down the chimney and most important, the marvels of Santa's toy workshop.The book is devilishly clever and a must for any parent, teacher or child."
5,The Santa Claus Book,"This is the best Santa Book ever! Good for all ages. We have made this part of our family tradition. Unique and fun information to keep children believing in Santa and full of the magic of Christmas,Santa, his elves, Mrs. Claus, etc. Makes Santa more real, yet more magic than ever. Great gift for children and new parents. This book should be published again in hard bound!"
3,barely an ok read,"Don't get me wrong, the story was thoroughly entertaining, and the hero was fabulous, but the other reviewers are dead-on about the history-or the lack there of-being presented here. I've read all of Lee's books, and I continue to enjoy them, but I can only recommend this book as a fantasy read, not for those who truly enjoy historical fiction (but then I'm not a stickler for the details, I just want the romance)."
3,Good - but not quite good enough for more stars!,"For me this book dragged a little too much in the first half. Just too much repetitive discussion about the Freefellow works, too just general discussion without much intensity. Then Colin and Gillian finally marry and this couple that barely knew one another are passionate and quickly fall in love. I don't know it just did not quite have it for me. I think there should have been more focus on the end of the book and more reason to really feel the love and also more build up to the solving of the other Coin Fox mystery. Ok and I will read the others in the series but not quite more than 3 stars for me."
4,"As described, just very slow shipping.","No problems with the order, just incredibly slow shipping. I did not pay for any kind of fast shipping, just the standard. However I specifically ordered this book from an Indiana seller (I am in IN) assuming shipping would only be a few days. I received a notice saying the book had shipped (no tracking info) and gave an estimated arrival time frame. The book did arrive within the give time frame (a 2 week window), but again, as I am located in the same state I did not expect my book to arrive at the limit of that time frame, which is what happened. The book itself was as described, and again, no problems with the order, just disappointed in the length of the shipping time. If you need your book in a hurry, and the faster shipping from this seller."
2,Merely a bad book and waste of my money,"This book is filled with period inaccuracies. She doesn't even know when the little season takes place! Hint, it's not during the spring. I wish authors who write historical romances would bother to learn about the era they set their books in. If this is the amount of effort you want to put into researching your books, write contemporary novels, and quit luring those of us who actually like history into wasting $7 only to be annoyed."
3,seems good.,"this seems like a great book, but i am unsure on some pronunciation, as this was not shipped with the cds it said it was supposed to come with, so the guide in the book is not much help at all.once i learn pronunciation, this book will be amazing."
4,"Nice intro to Icelandic for the ""curious""","Like most of the Routledge ""Colloquial"" series, this one offers a semi-immersion training method. After a detailed introduction to the sounds of Icelandic: vowels, consonants, stress, etc., you are plunged into a series of dialogs between a native Icelander and a visitor. The dialogs proceed at near-normal speed (which in my mind is a good thing; it's the way you'll hear the language spoken), so I have had to listen to them over and over again -- I consider this a positive approach -- to accustom my ear to the way words string together and cause elisions and other phenomena of spoken language that are hard to acquire from a book alone.For a paperback, the book itself is nicely composed: good paper, typeface is easy to read. The CDs, likewise, are clear and easy to follow."
2,Not Well Organized or Thought out,"This book is OK as a VERY basic introduction to Icelandic. You learn the word for ""coach"" (ruta) before yes and no. Also, the exercises are short and insignificant. When you learn about declensions (probably the most important aspect of Icelandic grammar), all the book has is a long paragraph, a HUGE graph (with vauge footnotes ""There is a subgroup of masculine nouns which has -ir instead of -ar in the nominitive plural and -i in the accusative plural"". No hint of these words), and one, measly fill in the blank activity.This is good if you want to become vaugely acquainted witht the language, or if you just want to learn a few phrases. For the serious Icelandic student, get the Teach Yourself book."
5,Fast service provided,The book came within 4 days of being ordered. It was received in the condition that was stated in the description. Would definitely order from them again.
1,Would not run on new versions of windows,Beware! This cd would not run on windows vista or windows 7. This is going back for sure. Don't waste your time of money.
2,not as good as the others,I have a couple of their other records and they are amazing. This one on the other hand is only for the true dirty three fan who is interested in how thier music came to be what it is today. It sound like very early recording. not very good.
3,"Works ok, but some investigation needed to use","Relay worked well, after I performed some investigation and research. The product information that came with it is much less than what is needed, at least for me. I muddled through it, but installation took longer than it should of."
4,The books that accompany the tape are excellent.,I just received this in the mail and I love it. The books that accompany the tape are exactly what nurses and doctors can keep in their lab coats. Our charge nurse is going to order one for our desk.
1,It's not even funny how biased this is,"The author is completely in love with Wellington. He refers to Napoleon as ""the much overrated General Buonaparte."" He doesn't have the courtesy to call him by his prefered name. He describes Wellington's dispatches as a joy to read, whereas they are actually very dull. As far as I can tell, he has his facts right, he just presents them in a very one sided and boring way. Overall, if you need something to start a fire with, this is the book for you."
5,This is a WONDERFUL book for children and adults,I read this book as a child and I have read it to my classes and all the children young and old love it!
5,Truly Unique,"I found a reference to this after having searched the internet for marshmallow recipes. The recipe was posted online, but I bought the book figuring it was the right thing to do. I had NO idea how delightful this would be. Most of the recipes I've never seen anyplace else (gingerbread cookie MIX!?!) The marshmallow recipe alone has won me a couple marriage proposals. If you have any impulse to cook or bake, please buy this book. You will be amazed."
5,"One of the Best cookbooks, ever!","This is a book that is a 'must' for all serious cooks.. Learn how to make REAL bagels, corn beef, marshmallows and on and on. I had a copy and lost it...a great loss indeed. If you can lay your hands on a copy, do so, then fling a lip around all the wonderful things you will create!"
2,Better than store bought,"I was disappointed in this book, because most of the recipes were for things I don't use. I gave the book away after looking through it. It's mostly recipes to make convenience foods, which we don't eat in the first place."
1,This is a shell game ...,"This is a RERECORDING of the music. DO NOT BUY THIS unless you want ridiculous ""digitally recorded in 1995"" versions of great songs. It sounds absolutely terrible."
2,The Best of The Chi-Lites,"To any and all ""true"" Chi-Lites or Eugene Record fans,This album containing the phase of greatest hits or best of... in its title should not be used because it is misleading. This album in particular although contain a few solid hits does not do the group justice. This album is only but a sparkle of the real brilliance of what the Chi-Lites have to offer. Please, please, please, consider the ""Too Good To Be Forgotten"" BOX collaboration as your only option. This BOX collection really and truly defines the superb talents of Eugene Record and the group. There are so many vintage songs that only could be found on LP's, but now can be appreciated again on CD.Do not sell yourself short.......Get the real deal! You will thank me for it, but more importantly you will THANK YOURSELF for doing the right thing."

1,Brunswick,"Can you help me find the original recording on ""Stoned Out of My Mind"" by the Chi-Lites. Most of the C.D.'s are the Brunswick re-recordings. Thankyou.Russell M. Wilson Jr."
2,Precisely What I Expected,"I saw the other reviews for this product. People seemed truly outraged and disgusted by this book and had terrible things to say about the authors. To them, I ask ""What did you expect?"" This book is exactly what I thought it would be - a great deal of fluff and speculation about Brad, Jennifer and their lives together. What struck me about this book was how I could read over 200 pages and end up knowing so little. It seems to me that this is VERY typical of a certain kind of reportage (and I use the word advisedly). I find the whole celebrity fascination fascinating and this seemed to me an excellent specimen and case study. With all that said, the content of the book seemed remarkably superficial and vacuous."
1,Lousy Book,"I came across this book in Barnes and Noble the other day and I must say I was horrified. The title alone is enough to make we want to write a letter to US Weekly and ask why in the world they hired those writers. Anyone who thinks about buying this book should ask themselves two very important questions ""Do I care?"", ""Should I care?"" If you're somewhat intelligent your answers to both of those questions will be NO and you'll put the book back on the shelf and feel bad the rest of the day."
1,Deplorable,"I wonder what kind of person revels enough in another's private anguish to buy this rubbish.The authors and publishers should be ashamed of themselves.(To comment on this item one must check at least 1 star, unfortunately.)"
2,so many errors,I've just finished reading chapter 2. There are a bit of errors and it's written not so well in rigorous point of view. such as:1. the subscript j of E in the formula of # of failure times on page 592. maybe it doesn't make sure for the notation Var(O_i-E_i)3. the formula of e_{ij} on page 82.
2,"It's OK, but ...","Unlike other reviewers, I did not find this book very helpful, especially considering the price I paid. The book is essentially a PowerPoint course presentation published with the notes pages as text. Unfortunately, the book is laid out so that the reader must make the connection between the text and the slide itself (they're stacked side-by-side with no separation). Often, the text discusses the material as though the instructor had a pointer in hand to make the connection -- without those visual clues the argument is hard to follow. On the other hand, if you know nothing about survival analysis and only want to run computer programs (specifically SPIDA) and read the output, I guess this book isn't bad. I'll keep looking for a good textbook."
2,"Poorly Written, Poorly Conceived","This book struck almost every single one of my biggest peeves about texts. Numbers written out as words: this is, essentially, a mathematics book. We don't like letters, we like numbers, and writing out ""thirteen point five"" is only outdone by the obnoxiousness of writing out whole equations in the text. Readers who need to be told that ""X-3/ln(X+5)"" means ""x plus three divided by the natural log of x plus five"" should probably not be using this text.Second, the details of examples are sparsely filled, and examples don't go all the way through. Many of them are great for theoretical concepts, like how a statistic works, but give no hint as to how one might actually employ it. Page after page of SAS, STATA, and SPIDA output are useless without the accompanying code to create them.The index is astoundingly cursory. It's really hard to find anything.Frankly a worthless text, I'm glad I bought it used."
5,THE BEST ELVIS ALBUM EVER,THIS IS A VERY GOOD ALBUM OF ELVIS. I RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE WHO LIKES ELVIS!
5,Great CD by THE KING OF ROCK,"Loved the CD, however at the end of it are some bonus tracks of Hawaii tunes that are not on the original soundtrack that I recall from years ago. Makes me kind of wonder if it is an original CD but overall, still quite pleased with it.Fast shipping and courteous merchant!Two thumbs up!"
5,Elvis Aloha From Hawaii,I ordered this as a gift and had it delivered to the recipient. They were thrilled with the merchandise. Delivery was fast and item in perfect condition. My friend said they thoroughly enjoyed both the CD and the Video.
3,Better than Elvis at MSG!,"Aloha from Hawaii Via Satellite released a year after Elvis at MSG,was probably pointless to release. Who needs a live album two years in a row? Aloha from Hawaii is a much better album that the previous live album from Elvis. The set is considerably different, with very little 50's music making it into the set. A few songs are performed very poorly like Hound Dog, but the majority of the album is enjoyable."
3,a good report of an event that had a timely impact on world,This book provided information about a subject that has great indirect impact on world milieus connected to theft and intellectual careers. It can provided insight into determining whether interpretations of events are clouded with suspicion
4,Porter-Cable 7336,This is a very nice unit. Works great. Would have given it 5 stars but I am afraid that the bearings may burn out relatively quickly. I've had problems with them in the past so I tried a more expensive Bosch unit. What a piece of junk. It burnt out in 2 months of light use (wet-sanding). Repaired under warranty and burnt out again 9 months later with MAYBE once a week use. I'll stick with the Porter-Cable from now on.
5,The best sander!,"I have had the 7336 for 10-13 years and I too have stopped using my belt sander. It removes stock rapidly, yet is easy to control which is great when being used by unskilled employees. I have had problems with the switch. I think it gets fouled with the dust as I ""fixed"" it one time just by blowing the switch with compressed air for 30 seconds. I think I'll buy a couple of switches. They appear easy to replace. Last note: a 5"" disk is only 70% of the size of a 6"" disk, so you have a lot less abrasive on the work surface. btw, I have large hands and don't grip the tool too tightly - no problem with my wrists...This is a follow up. The problem was caused by worn out brushes-blush-not the switch."
4,The Trees,"Set during the time period when the Ohio Valley was first being settled, this is about the trials and tribulations of the Luckett family, who left Pennsylvania for the virgin forests in the Northwest territory. Richter was basically a poet, and this novel (first volume in a trilogy) is mostly acknowledged for its poetic writing, which is as independent and sinewy as the pioneers it describes. Richter's favorite poetic device is the simile, which he perhaps over uses. The best part is when little Sullie disappears in the woods one day and is never found - it's a very powerful scene rendered even more so by the author's carefully crafted sentences and word choices. A good novel."
5,Great Story,"I saw the miniseries years ago and loved it instantly. This seems like the real way it must have been for our ancestors (not that far back!). It's always fascinating to get a glimpse of how people lived many, many years ago. I read the Trilogy, and found this book, as the first in the series, probably my favorite. It will capture your imagination from the beginning."
2,"tedious, but my friends loved it.",A good read to some is not necessarily a good read to all. Certainly well researched. Just not for my teacup.
3,Acquired Angkor Wat Taste,"""The Music of Cambodia:Royal Court Music"" introduced me to the richness and exotica of Asian music. Musically,Cambodia lacks the high-profile of J-pop,Peking Opera,and the soundtracks of Hong Kong action films. Cambodia is a country of great tragedy and glory. The ruins of Angkor Wat testify to a resilient ancient culture that has survived despite the ravages of time as well as the Khmer Rouge's oppression.In ""Royal Court Music"",the pinpeat and mahori orchestras take center stage. There are instrumentals for different parts of the day-for weddings, or even feeding turtles (one of my favorite tracks)-as well as accompanying dances (track six is for the Asparas,borrowed from Hindu mythology)This album isn't as accessible as the latest from Gackt and Puffy Ami Yumi,but it serves as a snapshot of an ancient,resilient culture. It is a look at a traditional culture that gets little attention,but deserves more."
2,Canciones mal indexadas,"El mp3 no corresponde a la canción que se indica. Si compras el disco completo, esto puede no ser un problema, pero yo quise comprar ""los 7 perritos"" y me vendieron ""un barco chiquito""Por lo demás, Cepillin me encanta"
2,dissapointing!!,"Andrew Greeley has lost his sense of identity as a priest, otherwise he would not have published something so close to romance (code word for print-a-porn). As an alledged catholic, he is a heretic (at least in that novel). As for the rest of the book, it is a lot of sentimentalistic Irish-American superstition and drivel; taking place in an Ireland which the real Irish cannot recognize. terribly dissapointing!"
5,Irish Love,"Being Irish myself, I could see the happenings in this book as close to true as possible.A wonderful Love story with a twist that I could not believe. Wonderful reading. Father Greeley is a great writer, I have read most of his works and reccomend them to all who like love stories, as well as a taste of comedy."
3,Irish Love,The product was in great shape upon receiving it. However I did not receive this product in a timely manner. I was disappointed in the service.
4,memory jogger,great tool to help you remember all the things you can't. Definately a good resource for review and quick reference.
4,A Practical Pocket-Size Piece on Protection,"Since the dawn of time, mankind has been menaced by deadly chemical and biological weapons. This book provides useful information that fits in your pocket (and it makes a great stocking stuffer.) It is simple and easy to understand yet organized and practical. I would have included more information on what to do while sheltering in place (like games for the kids and a bottle of scotch for dad.)"
2,Nothing New Here,"Mostly revisited material which you can find elsewhere. The way the book was put together is helpful, and for the novice it might be somehwat helpful."
5,Better than Duct Tape and Plastic,Excellent reference. I now see that there's more to protection against chemical and biological agents than duct tape and plastic over the windows.
4,"The First, with Better to Follow","Khenany's music has a timeless quality that allows one to relax and dream without outside pressure. It's too bad that Amazon has only one Khenany CD to choose from; I know of at least five that have been recorded by the group, and each is better than the previous, both in musical quality and in production techniques. This debut album is entirely instrumental, but Khenany's vocals are excellent. If you have a chance to listen to more Khenany you will not be dissapointed."
3,Good and Silly book,"If you ever wanted to go through life with your teddy bear that you grew up with, this book can show you one English man's experience. William Pene Du Bois, author of Newbery Winner, 21 Balloons, has written a unique book about Billy Browne-Browne and his bear Bayard. They go through prep school, college, the 1936 Olympics, World War II and old age. Wonderful book. If you collect teddy bears, this would make a nice addition and converstation piece."
5,Cult Gen X Classic!!!,"I have been waiting for the Twitch City DVD since watching the show on Bravo years ago. The show is about a couch potato named Curtis (actor/director Don McKellar ) who spends his days eating fruit loops and watching TV. To support his slacker lifestyle, Curtis rents out his extra room out to a revolving cast of strange characters.Bruce McCulloch and Mark McKinney from ""Kids in the Hall"" take turns guest staring as crazy chat show host Rex Reily.Fans of smart comedy like ""Arrested Development"" and ""The Office"" will appreciate this well written comedy."
5,An Astonishing View of the Spiritual Journey,"The Experience of No-Self simply one of the most significant books on the spiritual journey written in our time-- indeed, one of the most important books of all time.Review updated, Oct 2012: A great complement to this book is Bernadette's newest work, The Real Christ. Though not yet available through Amazon.com, The Real Christ can be purchased currently through a website created by some of Bernadette's friends.Joseph Conti, Ph.D.Dept of Comparative ReligionCalifornia State University, Fullerton"
4,Profound journey leaves readers wanting,"An interesting read, a profound message - but the climax (which in none other than ultimate reality) is given very little explanation. All this pain, and fear only to breakthrough to the other shore, and then a few sentences on the ultimate ???Please Bernadette let us have more on this..."
3,"supereb voice and delivery, ordinary songs","What I dislike about coutry music is its recent commercialism, charaterized by the ""mainstream"" Nashville megastars. What I do like about coutry music is it's simplicity, poignancy and accessibility. Neko Case's voice captures these qualities precisely. Case's voice was criticized as mediocre and ""Nashville wannabe"". I think the latter attack is actually her strong point. Who's to say what good voice is? Musicians such as Bob Dylan, Tom Waits, Captain Beefheart, Tom House and Howlin' Wolf have lousy voice. But their talent and artistic achievement are indsiputable. I happen to love Case's wild, untrained and free-wheelin' voice. I think the songs on this disc could be improved though. It still sounds a little too polished and conforming to me. If Neko Case would do let the little formality and ""traditions"" that she's holding on, she has the potential to be a truly remarkable musician of out time."
3,little bit country...,"hmmm don't like it nearly as much as fox confessor, which was a tiny bit country, but more folksy and interesting lyrics - this one is just so country I can't even listen to it - she is a great musician, and if you like country music then buy it for sure-"
5,absolutely great,"I want to thank whoever decided that Neko Case should open for Nick Cave because I never would have discovered her otherwise. I don't like country music but I love this record. Neko Case has a voice that gives me goosebumps. She sings with a lot of attitude (like on ""Mood to Burn Bridges"") and a little bit of anguish (like on ""we've never met""). It's a great collection of songs that I can't stop listening to. If you get a chance to see her live, go!"
5,Underrated,Was an unexpected treat to see the origins of Miss Case. I am now a huge fan of her music even more than before I fell in love with Middle Cyclone.
4,Neko case & her boy friends.,"I liked this disc. I like her music. This one is kind of a country and western them. Could I recommend this disc, if one has liked her music in the past probably so. There are some soft spots but then there always are, overall I think it is a good disc to add to ones Neko Case collection. I should know I bought her other two discs and will buy some more in the future I am sure. What would I have wanted to know prior to my purchasing this disc nothing really I have her Middle cyclone disc and used that for my bases in buying the others. It is hard to quantify music. I think having samples to listen to is a very good thing, it helped me to finalize my choices."
4,Rowdy and fun; plenty for the listener to explore.,"What lively songwriting and a terrific voice can do. In general country music is one of my least favourite genres, but this CD keeps inviting me back for repeated spins. Neko Case's voice is full of spirit and strength, and her rotating backing band is consistently excellent. However, the most attractive thing to me about this disc is the diversity of moods that the songwriting effortlessly traverses over the course of just a few tracks. There's the downright rockin' ""Set Out Running"", the lovely mood of ""Porchlight"" (the song lives up to the hazy mystique of its title), and the wildly varying rhythms of ""Mood to Burn Bridges"". I'm a big fan of challenging song structures (eg. Shannon Wright's Maps of Tacit), and this album delivers, offering hidden delights that keep unfolding."
5,I'm in love with Neko,"This is the best alt-country record ever. I'm more a fan of older country (Johnny Cash, Hank Williams, Patsy Cline, Webb Pierce, etc.) but this knocked my socks off. It just gets better every time you listen to it. Love is not an easy thing and relationships and break-ups do not get easier with time. This record proves that. Neko also has the best female country voice since Patsy Cline. No one can sing it like her. The fact that she's got members of the Sadies backing her up adds to the punch. She has a very strong voice, but it is very pretty at the same time. I can't really put into words how much I love this album. Just buy it!"
4,"nice headphones, lousy service","The G72LP headphones are really nice. I was impressed with the sound and the bass. Additionally, I believe these are the only Sony ""street style"" behind-the-back headphones that fold up. When it's folded up, it's no larger than a tennis ball.The absolutely WORST thing about these is the replacement policy for the ear pads. I bought mine a few years ago, and the ear pads have gotten quite worn out and actually a bit torn. The replacements for these flimsy little pieces of foam cost over [$$$]!! That's just absolutely ridiculous and is a sure sign Sony just wants you to buy a new pair of headphones. ... At a cost of that much, my G72s are sitting on my desk, unused for the last several months."
3,"Above avg value, above avg discomfort","For the money, these are good ""active"" headphones with better sound than can typically be achieved by the small-driver, in-ear headphone alternatives. The behind-the-neck design is useful on runs where you have to wear a hat to protect against the sun or if you just want to keep your hair neat. I have found that 40 minutes is really the most I can stand to wear these before they start causing gradually more intense pain around the ears. The foam pads don't last long and the cord is, actually too long for some work-out applications since you must wind it round and round to keep from catching it while running and yanking the phones off."
4,Quite A Gamble,It was a memorable book about vampires in love. Two prideful vampires who lack trust in their world because of a vengeful past. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys romance and vampires.
4,A pain to install but once in not bad,"For the product, I have to say it does what is does well. It adds a mounting point to hold whatever accessory you can think of that will fit the mount. It is sturdy and the construction is well. The only reason why I am not raving about the product was the instruction for installing was not crystal clear. Looking up a few video on youtube helped with the install process."
3,"traditional instruments, NOT traditional music","Except for tracks 2,3,6,13,17, the other tracks are communist war propaganda, anti imperialist, and nationalist doctrine. Modern compositions and ideals were made for the traditional instruments. The sound quality is very good. The performance of the instruments is excellent."
3,Intriguing but also Confusing...Ultimately Not Completely Satisfying,"I don't know if I would have read more in this series had I read Helmet of Horror and/or Lion's Honey first...I liked Helmet more than Honey...but it not on my list of things I could read over and over. The idea of the labyrinth being both a physical thing AND being the internet (specifically a chat room) is certainly intriguing and novel...but the whole thing sort of confused me. I suppose that was rather the point...the tale itself is something of a labyrinth and the tread being something of an in joke with the chat room/message board response system. Overall, I'd say it was well done and I'm sure if I were to read it again, I'd be able to pull more meaning out it, because I was left with the feeling that I'd missed something...so maybe down the line when I get my own copy, I'll reread it and see what else it brings to me. Looking forward to the next one!"
3,One of Pelevin's lesser work,"The computer screen as stage and instant messaging as action in this lesser work by Victor Pelevin. Certainly no match to his ""Buddha's little finger"" or ""Omon Ra"""
5,Haunting,"First of all, I'm not one of those who believes Roddy's early work was his best. In fact, I consider later work such as ""Frestonia"" and ""Dreamland"" among his best. ""Western Skies"", however, even outshines these. From the hauntingly beautiful opening title track, this CD demands you sit up and listen to Roddy's emotive voice, poetic lyrics, and vituoso guitar playing. It's a shame he hasn't gotten the recognition he deserves. When I went to a local US Virgin Megastore looking for this CD, after spelling the name to the clerk, he reported he didn't have it, and most of his stuff was ""out of print"". Oh well. On the other hand I kind of enjoy having this as my very own personal music. But do yourself a favor and buy this CD. If you're not captivated by it like I was, I can't help you."
4,Breathtaking,"I bought this book the day it hit the shelves and read it in hours. It reveals how vulnerable we remain to terrorism and why the Bush administration is not to be entrusted with our security.Bush blocked every meaningful investigation into the real network of connections that funded and aided the 9/11 killers, and especially he blocked a probe into the involvement of Saudi Arabia.But this book is not only a critique of the Bush administration. Graham delves into many other related topics, including the real threats in the Middle East and how those threats are mutating over time.Graham has the goods. From his unique position on the Senate intelligence committee, he has a much better informed perspective than almost anyone else writing about this topic.Read this book before Nov. 2."
5,Excellent ...A Must Read!!!!!!,"This book details how George Bush has placed Saudi oil in front of our national security. The White House blocked investigations of two Saudi officials who funded and housed two of the 9/11 hijackers, allowed them to leave the US and insisted 28 pages in the 9/11 commission report e ""classified"".Bush misled America with false claims to attack Iraq and then allowed the Pentagon to disregard international torture laws. This is a recruiting poster for budding terrorists.Why has Bush avoided challenging Saudi Arabia and Pakistan's aid to Al Queda? Why has he prioritized ""nation building"" over avenging 9/11 and hunting Bin Laden? No answers justify his disregard for our security. This book tells us what the white house doesn't want us to know."
4,Rather Good,"Although slightly partisan and carrying a slight self-congradulatory tone in parts, this is a fairly good presentation of the facts. His recommendations are well-thought and should be given serious consideration."
4,Strong effort,This was a very strong book by Graham.Presents a compelling case for White House/CIA incompetence and raises important flags about critical information that still hasn't come to light about the Saudi Royal Family role in 9/11. It's well worth purchasing.
4,"guiters, vocals, and guiters","The only reson that this album is not a 5 is because Ted himself didn't do the guiters. However, if you like hard hitting ax players, you have to pick this one up. Guitar greats like Jake E. Lee, and D.J.Ashba grind out hard licks and crunching solo work. buy this album to [upset] your wife/girlfriend."
5,Must See for All Hockey Parents and Players!,"This is a must see to enjoy the extreme side of a parent who knows his son is destined for the NHL (ha). Like most parents, we all have that dream our kids will ""be the one"" but we keep it in perspective. This film takes it to the next level - every episode had us laughing until our sides hurt."
3,Hook and Loop not for all,"A great little sander with one caveat...hook and loop pads are more expensive than standard adhesive backed discs. I also found in a continual use environment that the hooks on the pad tend to wear down making the loop discs' hold on the pad tenuous at best, making it dificult to sand anything. The dust collection works well but limits the type of sandpaper useful with this machine as the dust pickup hole pattern is specific. I love mine when it works but have made some minor adjustments to ensure that it does what I want how I want."
3,Hook & Look-not good.....,"My father & I both purchased the Porter Cable 333VS within 1 month of each other and we both have had to replace the Hook & Loom pad. The sand paper adheres great for about the first 3 months of light use and then the pad flies off the sander from then on. I orginally thought it was an isolated problem, until we both had the same problem!!! I contacted Porter-Cable and they have sent me a replacement pad free of charge but what do I do after the warranty period is over??? The only option is to look at another manf. until Porter Cable has this resolved."
1,Not what they used to be....,"PC products have always had a good reputation and have been know for their reliability. The 333VS misses the mark. Although it is a good design and appears to a well-built unit, I have a 6 month old unit with 2 bad bearings. I have also experienced pre-mature failure of the H & L pad.Since a sander is only as good as it's components, equipment manufactures would do well to dump the cheapo Chinese bearings and get back to quality components.I am now faced with investing another $30 in replacement bearings, or applying this amount to a replacement unit. I am extremely disappointed in Porter Cable...."
3,its grreat but...,this is a good sander for someone that dosnt sand alot...it runs well and has for me a couple of years so far. its comfortable in your hand for a long time but gets hot and the case kind of seperates if you bear down with it..so ive graduated to the PC7335 which you can run all day and take off alot of material. a couple of suggestions the dust collector dose tend to pop off but i drilled a hole and put in a small screw to hold it in place and havnt had a problem since..and then the hook loop delema you can either buy a replacement pad for stick on paper or buy the PC model that comes with it allready but dont waste your money on hook and loop paper unless this is your only sander and you plan on changing grit often...good luck
1,Not as good as original quick sand,"I am a professional furniture repair/refinisher and have owned 2 original 5"" H&L Quick Sand machines.Aside from the fact that they burned up they were good tools.They were used almost on a daily basis and stood up very well to my abuse. The new replacement is a frustrating,non-ergometric piece of crap.It is top heavy and almost impossible to operate without inducing scratch marks in my work.I love PC products but will buy the low profile 5"" sander and relegate this thing to refinishing underwater boat ramps. G.M."
3,Porter-Cable's sanders could stand some improvement,"I have used 333 and 333vs sanders extensively. I have even burned-out 2 of them. They perform very nicely with a nice ergonomic hand grip. Control is excellent and material removal is certainly adequate. However, the dust cannister constantly falls off resulting in the user resorting to duct-tape or some other measure. Also, PC's hook and loop pads very quickly lose their ability to hang on to the paper (too frequent replacement). In conclusion, I would buy Bosch instead. The sanding discs are hard to remove from their pads!"
5,A much better sander,"I had the opportunity to compare this to the new Ridgid model and the Dewalt. The Porter Cable is a much better sander. For instance, it does not send vibrations through your arm like the Ridgid. Very smooth operation, for a sander. About the only complaint I have is the speed adjustment dial; it's difficult to operate but perhaps, this is by design. It's made in the USA - always a plus. If you are looking for a 5 inch sander this is it."
5,Hooked and Loop de Loop,"This the best sander out there, however the disc attachment system makes it an average sander. I have had better sanders last longer with the adhesive pad system. Someone at research and Developement fudged on the results of this sanders pad. That person should be fired."
2,Not the quality the brand name and price make you expect,"I thought I had ordered a premium product, but I returned it right away, as the quality didn't keep up with the price.I really liked the idea of this dust container instead of these cloth bags elsewhere.But for a price that is almost twice of other brands (you can also get a nice variable speed sander for $50-$70) I would expect flawless manufacturing quality."
2,astrid gilberto now,"This is a double disc, one side is a cd, the other a dvd. The problem is that the cd side did not play properly. But the dvd side was absolutely fine"
2,Not good,This dvd is still photos (although she is very beautiful and easy to look at) and the songs seemed very childish (for lack of a better word) to me. I regret this purchase.
3,Interesting.,Not a book that I could not put down but it was an interesting read. My tablet displays it wonderfuliy.
1,Atlantis,"The book is long winded and repetative. I was more than half way through it and the characters were still on the boat with no signs of Atlantis. I stopped there, something I rarely do when reading a book."
3,"Informing, but meridian charts too indepth; confusing","I liked the information I got from this book. Occasionally the written description was a bit ""fuzzy"", though mostly clear. Though the illustrations were usable, they were too detailed. I would find myself unable to use the charts as I was giving a massage or just learning. Otherwise, the writing was fine. I found this book useful in my career."
5,birds best,This feeder does everything it was designed to do. It keeps the big birds out as well as the squirrels. The caged feeder creates an environment the smaller birds are comfortable with along with keeping them and the feed dry during inclement weather. This feeder is quality built and I recommend it as a top choice.
4,Beginning gimp,"I used this book for a class, it was good but vague at times. I had to look up some tutorials online to help me out."
4,You need this book to understand what you're doing,"If you're a novice at editing photos - the type of person who goes crazy trying to embed AutoCAD drawings or photos in Word documents - then this book is for you. I've been a little bit frustrated trying to find the exact page in this book that will tell me what I want to know, but overall, if you're patient, this book is great. If you haven't used the GIMP before, you should definitely have a text to help you out if you're doing more than cropping or color editing.If you read through everything before attempting anything, I think this book may be 5 stars, but I haven't read it all."
3,A bit disappointed,"I have been impressed by the author's tutorials, so had high expectations for the book. I can't quite put my finger on it, but something is missing. I guess I expected more nuts and bolts."
5,Written for the Non-basic!,"I understand software. I can pick up software and generally figure out how to use it. I don't need a book to tell me how to use software. This book does have one or two chapters of that type. However, it's what comes after that I like.This book does what those of us who are beyond basic need. It describes how to use the tools to accomplish certain results. It is organized by desired result. Do you want to get a building out of the picture? It tells you how. Change the color of something? It's there.What I really appreciate is that it tells me about a lot of tools I never discovered on my own because I didn't know to look for them. I never heard of quick-masking and I had no clue about intelligent scissors.Thanks to this book, I'm starting to actually use the GIMP and to understand what it does."
5,Gimp 2 for photographers is GREAT!,"Both books are good, but Gimp 2 for Photographers is GREAT! I got MUCH use out of it. I am a photographer and I can tell you this book is a must if you are trying to learn how to use Gimp and get used to the features quickly and sufficiently to perform whatever you need. Great book!"
3,Customer service could be easier.,"My son is enjoying the bike but it came with a big crack in the plastic engine. I called to see about getting a replacement part and I have to prove my purchase, take a photo of the piece that is cracked, and email them copies of everything, just to get them to ship me a new piece of plastic.Why would I want a piece to something if I didn't buy it or it wasn't cracked? They can see by their records it was shipped to me within the last couple of days. I find this to be very irritating."
4,FORGET THE LIVE STUFF !!!!!,"The first half of the album is a crappy executed,crappy sounding live gig,like it had been rcorded with a walkman ! ).The second half,on the other hand,is a strong,violent,in your face,powerful,tight anarcho-punk album that is worth the price for itself.So are the 2 following albums,Sliced Punx On Meathooks,and We're Still Here,the latter being available only in USA,being a Japanese recording.This band,like wine,has only gotten better with time,not sounding cacophonic any more in favor of a tighter streetpunkish sound.The studio tracks are incredibly hi-fi sounding,and I really appreciate that on a punk recording.A BLAST !!!!!"
4,Vladislav Delay - Multila,"Vladislav Delay's album on Chain Reaction, MULTILA, strikes a beautiful minimalist stance on the first two tracks, ""Ranta"" and ""Raamat,"" layering long, sustained notes with electronic gurglings underneath. ""Huone"" injects a kick drum into the mix, letting the tones throb in time with the beat for about 20 minutes. Delay slowly adds and removes elements from the track, so that it expands, rather than grow stale (for instance, the beat drops out halfway through, only to return a few minutes later). ""Viite"" piles on the distortion, and ""Karha"" goes for moody ambience. ""Pietola"" is ambient as well, but with more clicks and buzz. And, finally, ""Nesso"" goes for bright and swirling. While not groundbreaking (as some of the early Chain Reaction releases), it's certainly an excellent listening experience."
3,Freakishly flowing flucuations,"3 1/2Very decent ambient-industrial (if I had to fart out a label) that is not without its lulls and slightly amateurish touches but Delay clearly has a gift for audio manipulation. In this extreme introspective mode he merges the noise clusters of Fennesz, the organic drip of Bola, and the sterile order of Autechre into a rewarding experience for patient electronic experimenters."
3,Strangely appealing...,"It's hard to convey to someone why they could possibly like this CD. After all, it's mostly crackling, bubbly, dubbed-out drone. But there's method to the madness. Rhythms emerge, and on tracks like ""Huone"" and the latter half of ""Pietola,"" you might actually find yourself bobbing your head. Even if not you'll probably find the sounds of the album oddly organic and soothing. Proof, I suppose, that ""electronic music"" doesn't have to mean ""cold and sterile."""
1,Too messy,"I am a huge fan of the Basic Channel Chain Reaction releases. But this one is just too astract, too noisy. More experimental than musical, it lacks the quality most of the other releases have. The blurb on the front of the package ""Multila is a soundtrack for vision"" indicates we are being inflicted with an ""artiste"" attitude, who is more caught up in his ego than in actually producing listenable music. I say skip this one and get the other Chain Reaction cd's."
4,Very Solid Product for the Price,"Very solid product especially if you are running a professional services business. Provides all of the usual ""bells and whistles"" and makes the G/L accounting part seemless.I've not encountered any SQL errors and it is quite easy to enter misc adjustments (VISA Card Transactions) to your bank account and payables using the Bank Adjustments tab.It takes a little time to understand the details behind payroll, but once you've worked through it, it is a breeze.Great product for $30. Especially for a small company."
3,Correct a complaint,"I ordered ""Bookkeeper 2005"" sometime ago and it was shipped to California by mistake. The supplier had offered to give me credit and also give me the software because of the delay in getting the product. Unfortunately, I complained about the service and described the vendor's service as ""lousy"". On the back of my complaint I received the offer to replace the shipment at no charge, but I had already filed the complaint. My apologies to the supplier and please correct my comment about his service."
1,"Please do not buy eemax water heater, it's nothing but a headache....",We have the eemax water tankless instant water heaters in our home and I have to say they are a piece of poop. We just moved into our home and have had to change the one in the kitchen 3 times and we have had to change the one in the master bedroom 2 times......I can't take this not having hot water...I am ready to switch back to the good old fashion tank water heater...it works much much better.......
3,Reverse Osmosis Ultra-Leak,Anxiously purchasing this time and could not wait for great tasting water. The water lines leaked terribly. Went to local hardware store hoping for a fix. Still had problems. No enough connectors in bag. Water line not long enough. Drain hose trickles water into drain and is quite noisy. Would not purchase if I had a second chance.
5,Sailing the high seas,"Did you ever dream of sailing the high seas?! Did you enjoy the good clean fun, support and camaraderie of summer camp?! This book combines the best of those things. Many daring, quirky characters. Exotic settings. Wind in your sails. Lots of great themes, like reaching for your dreams, cooperation, loyalty, enterprise, patience, benevolent authority, and even work ethic(shhhh), are woven into enjoyable, inspiring, imaginative tales. I wish Shiver Me Timbers had been around when I was a girl, when there was a dearth of active heroines. But what fun it would be to read it to school aged kids!"
2,I worked with Peter Theroux,"I knew Peter Theroux in Saudi, we worked for the same organisation, to say he was a wild card was an understatement and although the editor was interested in his stories, the amount of self promotion and self gain left us all somewhat bemused.The book is bizarre and appears to be mostly fantasy; having worked and lived there at the same tim, for the same employer - none of rings true.How very strange."
3,lots of sand but not much water in this oasis,"I enjoyed much of the book until the end when I became fed up with Theroux's endless ruminations about the whereabouts of Moussa Sadr. I began to feel that since the author was unable to gleam anything new, he threw together some anecdotes because he still had to write a book."
3,Light Adult Entertainment,"I purchased a bunch of these Something Weird dvd's a while back and found them good light entertainment of a bygone adult nature...tame by today's standards, but fun in their hoakyness."
5,Awesome show...Quality ok...thanks Shout Factory!!,"It is a wonderful show that was graciously made to DVD for avid fans! I'm glad it was even released at all because I wouldn't have the pleasure of watching it today. I believe that too much negative feedback on quality might cause Shout Factory to reconsider releasing any future seasons and ruin it for the rest of us that actually want this nearly-impossible-to-attain TV show in our homes... and the quality wasn't even that bad! I don't know what anyone expects, but I didn't think it was atrocious, as people are describing it. There were a few little lines. Big deal. There were also a few episodes where it sounded like the actors were in a hall, but it reverted to normal sound eventually. This DVD collection is a must-have. Please give us a season 2! :)"
5,A Must Have!!,I have waited many years to have this dvd and I was very happy with it. Some negative reviews that the dvd was less than perfect didn't deter me from buying. Sure hope that the masters for the remaining seasons are in good enough shape for them to release them and soon!
3,Not quite what the title suggests,"This book offers a wide variety of selection techniques with numerous tips and tricks associated with selections and masks. On the other hand, compositing techniques seem almost contrived - perhaps just to sell a book. The bottom line is if you want to learn selection techniques, the pen tool, masks and some insight to alpha channels then you will be well served by Ms. Eismann's book. If you want to broaden your horizons in composting art you may be a bit disappointed."
4,A Masters Course in Photoshop,Katrin Eismann is an expert and she seeks to make you an expert in her book. It is a wealth of information. You'll learn how photoshop does some things and how you can make photoshop do some things that aren't evident in the commands and help files. I recommend reading the book then keeping it around as a reference to be used as situations or ideas arise.
4,Its good,"I like this book. It hasnt wowed me, but it is a good tool for learning a few of the many features in photoshop."
3,Photoshop Masking & Compositing,Not for the casual to mid level PhotoShop user and not as stright forward as expected.
4,Is this book helpful for Photoshop CS?,"I saw a review referred to multi pass technique. Can that be used if one only has CS? Is this book 100% helpful with CS?Thank you,Carol"
4,Depth for sure,"This book excels in illustrating masking and collage concepts, and rapidly moves to an intermediate to advanced level. It will take me several months and much revisiting of chapters to become proficient in all the techniques, but I look forward to it."
4,"Overall, a very good guide","Eismann's latest guide is a vast store of information. One might wish it to be a bit less vast, but if you can make your way through it, you will learn a lot about the subject. Slight demerits, from my perspective as a fine arts photographer, are that (1) the primary target audience seems to be Photoshop users who are doing work for someone else, and (2)some of the techniques described seem excessively complex, as though learned during the use of earlier versions of Photoshop. However, there is no question that this is a thorough, very useful, and clearly written treatment, as are all Eismann's contributions to the field."
4,Masking and Compositing,"Again, definitely for advanced beginner: Make sure you know your Scott Kelby basics first. Also make sure you like to read as there are a lot of details to digest. Author knows her subject well. Excellent information I learned a lot."
5,The most professionnal,"It is the book which is the nearest to the professionnal practice. I am working now as a teacher in a french university and as a former graphic designer in a newspaper, I was impressed by the book of Katrin Eismann. Great !!"
2,Poorly illustrated & badly in need of a an update,"For a book that purports to be the bible on all things masking and selecting in Photoshop some of the images used to illustrate the techniques described are practically useless, particularly in the way selection edges are treated. Photoshop's ubiquitous marching ants are often invisible.Also, with Photoshop CS5 now available a text based on the first release of CS is starting to look pretty dated. Sure, most of the techniques described in the book are still available in CS5, but so are 4 generations of product development and additional tools that perform tasks in one or two steps, instead of the six or seven this book describes.Useful if you want a first principles understanding of where Photoshop has come from, and how it works, but if you just want to do stuff I suggest many of Scott Kelby's publications would be a better option."
5,Great book.,"Though a bit over my head, regrading my current level of ability with Photoshop, I am visioned enough to see that this is one heck of a book. The author REALLY knows her stuff, and lays her knowledge down in a manner that seems easier to grasp, than I had previously thought. You do have to have to know your way around Photoshop, a bit, in order to really get up and running with the book's contents. But it isn't to say that the newbie couldn't get something out of it. It will just take him/her a little longer.It is a great book, indeed, and one that will offer the reader much growth. I would even venture to say that - after digesting, understanding and applying the principles in this book - the reader will attain status as a Photoshop Master."
5,Advanced Photoshop - Made Easy 101,"This book might not be for beginners, but intermediate and advanced users of Photoshop had better get a copy if you plan to create complex compelling designs. Heaven know how many years and books I've been through keeping up with the mix of Adobe software and Photoshop. However, its well worth it, when you run into the likes of Katrin Eisman. Katrin Eisman delves into the advanced areas of Masking and Compositing and breaks down the inner workings of Photoshop's mindset. You get a feel as to what Photoshop is thinking, (which is a prerequisite, if you plan to become a Pro) when you place each object on the workspace and manipulate its numerous attributes on the object, to recreate just what you need to accomplish without being hindered or overwhelmed by the power of Photoshop. The book comes with tons of hands on lessons to reinforce the concepts and even has additional lessons on its website for Photoshop instructors. This is the way to go!"
5,Katrin Eismann is the best!,"The cost of any book by Katrin Eismann is returned to the reader in value many, many times over. This book is everything the photoshop user needs to know about the sometimes daunting, but now made easy by Katrin, masking and compositing images. Now you can make those tough cut-outs of thin strands of hair against tough backgrounds that you used to run away from before.Katrin is one of the best and this book continues that tradition!"
5,For the professional,"This is a book that could be both a reference and an amazing learning tool for deep exploration in using channels as a selection tool, and fine color adjustments techniques. I haven't completed the book and maybe never will but everything I have read sheds new or a different light on photoshop selection and adjustment techniques. This is for the proficient in Photoshop beginners probably will find this book opaque and frustrating. Skilled photoshop users will find this a rich source of information and inspiration."
2,feeds squirrels,"This bird feeder is not squirrel-proof in my experience. Even on the lightest spring load setting, the squirrels around here have no problem sitting on the perch without falling. Maybe this will work for fat squirrels in the suburbs, but out here in the woods...."
3,Not proof against my squirrels,"I had high hopes for this feeder, as it is tall and my usual problems were with squirrels hanging from the top part of the feeder so they don't put weight on the closing mechanism. Unfortunately, they are still able to do this. Often they knock the spring off in the process. The other problem I have had with this feeder is the top is rather small compared with the last feeder I had. As a result, rain wets the seeds (at the bottom) and the whole thing gums up. There are drainage holes, but they are small and clog up from the bit of powdery junk typical in a bag of bird seed."
1,SQUIRREL PROOF???,"tHIS IS DEFINATELY NOT SQUIRREL PROOF. I put it out onthe pole and the next day, a sauirrel found his way upthe pole and after studying it, he found a way to notonly feed himself but also the squirrels and birds onthe ground. It may work up North but believe me we havesmaller but mightier squirrels in Florida. They not onlyget the food out but they broke the one side of the feeder. Now they can just help themselves.I DEFINATELY DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS FEEDER"
2,A bullshark! Wasted...,"This movie got 2 stars only because they used a bullshark. If they'd used a commonly used shark they'd have gotten no stars from me!I love shark movies...I was too young for Jaws, but I get excited to see movies that aren't about great whites. And as far as I know this was the first one about BULLSHARKS! They can live in lakes which makes them really scary. Yay!Well, the focus of this movie wasn't really on the sharks/shark as it was on a flimsy plot about robbers and thieves hunting for treasure and a crewman trying to get along with his ex wife on a business-boating trip. No one was worried about sharks until the last minute and it was all put it on the backburner. The good thing about this was that it wasn't a thinly veiled soft-porn like SOME movies. That still doesn't make it a shark movie! PLEASE someone make a good movie about the bullshark!"
1,What shark??,"I watched this movie, seeing that it was a ""shark"" movie. But where's the shark?? The plot is these people are hostages. The shark is just there so us shark fanatics have a reason to see this awful movie. But I was watching going, ""okay, they're in the water, where is the shark???"" Even JAWS 3, (which sucked) has more sharks. If you like hoatage movies, see this. (on second thought, don't...) But if you like sharks, see something else."
4,Actually has a plot.,For an older movie this one is very entertaining. Daughter is a habitual shark movie fan and watches this one over and over.
4,Great primer on what it's like to run a TV show,"I'm not in the industry, I'm just a guy who wants to understand more about how TV shows get made.This book does a good job of describing what it's like to run a show and all of the political BS that comes with the job. It's also an enjoyable read. I skimmed over the chapters that went into depth on how to schedule a week's worth of programming, but I could see that being valuable information to someone attempting to run a show themselves.The only criticism I have of the book is that it left me wanting for more anecdotes about what it was like for the author working in the industry for all those years. Maybe that wasn't the focus of the book, but those were the best parts, and it really helped me understand why things happen the way they do.I definitely recommend this book to anyone wanting to learn more about what's it's like to run a TV show."
3,IGNITIATELY FLIPPED THROUGH IT,"When this book arrived, I flipped through it, to make sure all of the pages were in tact, being as it was a used book with a remainder mark on the bottom of the book.I would like to say, this book did not provide the information I was searching for/looking forward to. but, it is packed with basic information, if you're writing for talk shows as the title implies.Conclusion is that the information provided in this book could have been published online on a blog or website free of charge. although, i'm sure there's several sites out there that focus on this topic. I bought it a couple of years ago and just now decided to leave a review about it.I would recommend this to those of us who do not have access to the web at all times, especially for research purposes."
1,Waste of money,This is old info and usless information with a pretty cover. Don't waste your money. Very dissapointing.
4,"Great product, poor wrap","The item is very nice given it is only $1.25. However, some boxed are a little bit stained.I would recommend this item for self use."
2,"By the end I was skimming it, just to finish.","I just could not get into this book. The characterizations seemed stilted and forced; the plot just had me rolling my eyes. Jack, our heroine, was not someone I was able to respect. She seemed flighty, insecure and not quite the brightest bulb on the tree. Rick didn't inspire any feelings of attraction in me, leaving him as a less than memorable hero.It will be a while before I purchase another Brownley book."
5,power adapter,Fast service. Item is perfect and hard to find.I like the adapter that allows me to use other transformers if this one goes bad.
4,Works with Yudu,"I bought this product because the Yudu products are too expensive. I haven't tried the sheets that come with a Yudu yet, I hear they are difficult. This one took a bit of trial & error to get the thickness etc correct. But after some trial, I learned not to get it too thick. I use a paintbrush to apply & a squeegee to even it out. Then you dry in the rack. It's pretty easy once you experiment."
5,Easy with great results,"i generally think of Speedball screenpinting products as being good for amateurs and beginners. While I've transitioned away from Speedball products for the most part in my seven years screenprinting I have stuck with Speedball's photo emulsion because it always gives me great results. This photo emulsion creates great results, the quality and resolution of the imagines I've fixed with this photo emulsion is always great and the only thing limiting the fine details is the mesh count of my silkscreen fabric, not the photo emulsion.This photo emulsion kit is easier to work with using a homemade setup, I use a 300 watt bulb that I bought at the hardware store for 3 dollars. Cleanup is always easy and this photo emulsion seems to be less toxic than a lot of the other competitors. Overall a great product that I recommend to everyone who wants to get into screen printing."
4,Only bad thing I could find,"I like the product. It was much easier to use than the pre-cut emusion sheets. The only thing that I noticed is you have to get another squeege, a better one because the one supplied by YUDU is not the best option for this kit. And Speedball does not supply a squeege."
3,"Emulsion great, Cleaner is useless","I'll break this into two parts, Emulsion and Cleaner.Emulsion: Perfect, *it's a small bottle, so depending on the size of screen and how many layers, you may want a larger bottle.*Screen Cleaner: Absolutely useless. It was like using water. It barely took anything off the screen. I ended up borrowing someone else's cleaner. Very disappointed."
3,Porter Cable Power Paint Remover,"The tool dose clean the paint from siding to bear wood but the word fast removel dose not apply, the disks clog if the speed is set to high,3.5 to 4.5 work about the best ,several disk are required while one soaks in paint remover and then is scrubed out with a wire brush and is sprayed with WD-40 before use to makeing cleaning the disk easier and the backing pad also will wheres out during use also it dose not go tight to the corner approx. 4 inches of paint remain to be removed with something else"
4,Porter Cable 7403,"The porter cable abrasive paint remover works great on my 100 + year old house. I have clapboard siding with 4 layers of paint. As stated in previous reviews the 24 grit carbide disc is your best bet for removing several layers of paint. It does take several passes and lots of patients, however. It cost half the price of the Paint Shaver Pro."
4,Horse shoeing?,We use our Porter-Cable paint remover for leveling a horses foot before putting on the shoe. We have a hydraulic tilt table for shoeing horses. We found the paint remover with 24 grit disk works better than an angle grinder for leveling the foot. Not the traditional use for it but it works for us.Bill HookerBlackfoot Horseshoeing
4,works well,this tool did work pretty well on the siding of my house but I had the same problems everyone else mentioned here. The tool can get heavy after awhile and would work much better with a dust collection system. A dust mask is mandatory. This tool should NOT be used on a ladder which definitly limits it usefullness since not everyone will go out and rent scaffolding like I did. The tool does a good job of removing most paint but you have to make sure to keep the tool moving to avoid scarring and you really need to go over your work with a sander afterwards to smooth out any swirl marks. Overall I think it is a good tool but it's weight is it's most limiting factor.
1,A better alternative...,"Sanding, grinding are agony on heavy paint build-up. The discs clog almost immediately. I saw an old copy of Old House Journal with an ad for Peel Away, tried that, and I'm pretty pleased."
1,porter cable paint remover,"This machine is a great idea, but really lacks in results. The pads that they require are great, but get all full of paint in a very short time. If you use these pads with a grinder, it works fantastic! One main Problem with this machine is that it only goes around 5,000 rpm, where a grinder goes 10,000 rpm. This way the pads last for hours."
4,Great product..watch out for gummed up disks.,"I am using the 7403 on a 102 yr old Victorian home that my wife and I are restoring. The 7403 works great until you get to the point where the latex builds up and gums the carbide disks. Shy of a heat gun (take it off the 7403 before using the heat), nothing really removes it quickly. I have a total of three disks and it seems that perhaps 6-8 disks would have been better. I keep switching them out as they gum up with paint. At the end of the day, I use the heat gun on all of them and clean up w/ a wire brush.Our house has seven layers of paint and a layer of stain below that. If you have fewer layers, you will be most likely better off. A previous review mentioned fatigue, due to the weight of 7403. This is especially true of overhead use (under porches etc.). Plan on resting every so often or you will be sore for days on end.The short story is that it works works well, but plan on sticky disks!"
4,Isn't Working,"I ordered this poster two months ago and unrolled it. Then I bought a frame for it. And I put the frame next to the poster. And I leaned them against the wall. And there they sit.....mocking me. I don't seem to be motivated enough to place them on my wall. I think I will just lie here in bed, in my filthy robe, until they shut my power off, then I won't have to look at the damned thing anymore."
3,Wrong picture! x 2 + good customer service = 3Stars,"When I ordered this product, I thought I would be getting the guy on top of a mountain as shown. What I received was a shark eating a fish with Ambition written at the bottom but a different saying. I see where the confusion could of come in and am dealing with the seller now to try and get what is advertised. I will edit/write another review based on how fast they fix this problem or if they do at all......After dealing with the people, they decided to resend me the poster but they messed up again and I got the wrong one again! so then I told them they messed up AGAIN! and they decided to give me a full refund which is still pending... It has been frustrating but I guess I cant complain too much since it was free minus a lot of my time dealing with customer service and waiting for the shipment to come. This will result in my 3 star rating even though I didn't get what I wanted, I got my money back."
5,I never bought this...,"But the other motivational posters I bought like this were awesome! Beautiful poster, great size. It deserves a nice pretty wooden frame.. the cheapo frame I bought does it no justice!"
2,I would not recommend this item.,"I have had several brands of guitar stands over the years. On Stage is a good brand however, the 3 guitar stand is disappointing. In fact I would have sent it back had I not thrown away the box and the invoice that came with it. Overall the construction is good but the arms that support the guitar necks are not long enough and so the headstocks are about 1/8th of an inch apart and if you're not careful the heads and tuners bump into each other. I have another brand that has longer arms and the guitars do not bump each other at all. Maybe this stand would be ok for small guitars but not if you want to display 3 dreadnoughts on the same stand."
1,Does not work well,The necks of your guitars will hit each other if you try to put more than one guitar on the stand. Not a good design.
5,Loving it.,"It is very strong.As long as you don't put 3 acoustic guitars on it, they will all fit fine. I have an electric, a bass, and a classical acoustic on mine and it all works. Tops are spread at a nice distance: about 2 - 3 inches from each other.The picture doesn't seem to show it, but there is a nice handlebar at the top so you can pick the whole thing up and move it.The best thing about it for me. It makes my home studio look awesome and professional. It's like my new centerpiece."
3,Good For The Price,"The distance away from the stand isn't really long enough for 3 guitars to fit in without their heads bumping, but it works great for holding multiple types of instruments. mine seats a mandolin, guitar, and tenor ukulele. soprano ukuleles will not work well unless it has an usually wide head. The quality is what you would expect from an triple guitar stand that is this cheap, but i've had it for several months and it has worked great so far."
1,NOT WORTH A BROKEN GUITAR!!!,"yeah it's a great price, but a triple guitar stand is supposed to fit 3 guitars on it. By the time you throw this piece of junk out, you will have lost 2 of them to random acts of guitar toppling after giving up on those annoying rubber neck restraints. I'm currently moping over a recent guitar tragedy for this exact reason. Why do the base holders not sit firmly? retarded. Get a huge amount of glue if you buy this junk to hold it in place. What a terrible waste."
5,good if you have 3 different type guitars,"I was very skeptically about buying this guitar stand after reading some of the reviews. It doesn't come with any instructions on how to put it together, but you honestly don't need any because its very easy to put together. Im very happy that i bought it because it is very sturdy and the rubber latches to keep the guitar from falling seem to be on there pretty good. I haven't had a problem getting the latches on or of either. I have a bass, an acoustic and a Guitalele on it and they all fit perfectly. Only one thing i wouldnt suggest, there's a handle on the top of the stand that seems like it could be carried, unless you are super careful i wouldnt try lifting it."
2,Not big enough for 3 guitars,"This is ok for one guitar, but not three. With more than one guitar, the headstocks will rest against each other."
2,not good,"I knew the price was too good to be true. This is the type of stand I would expect from Wal-Mart.Not for professional use. If you value your guitars, pay the price for a quality stand."
1,Not what we expected.,"My son plays bass, electric and acoustic guitars. He wanted a stand so we chose this one. It did not specify what types of guitar it would hold. This stand does not accommodate acoustic guitars. The base forks that hold the guitar are too far out, which causes the guitars to be leaned in a way that the head stocks would hit one another. Disappointing. The shipping to return this was about as much as the stand cost, so it was a loss all around."
3,Okay,"Holds up my guitars just fine, but the problem was, when it was shipped, they didn't give me a nut for the bolt to make it secure, and all of the nuts that I had located at the hardware store didn't fit the bolt that was given. So, needless to say i needed to rig it together with a separate nut and bolt in order for the stand to do it's job."
4,Works almost as it should,"This stand stands sturdily even with only one or two guitars. The only problem I have is that when using the stand for 3 similarly sized guitars, the headstocks touch. That being said, it is quite stable and solid."
3,Good price...quality a little lacking,"I'm not a fan of the ""good, for the price"" reviews, but in this case it fits.Thickness consistancy is not that great. If you are a production shop, these aren't for you. I'm a small shop and I can sort through to find usable biscuits, usually during the dry fit of a project. Percentage of bad ones are small, but during assembly, I have presorted good ones at the ready. Just depends on you needs.In my case, overall, it is still a good value."
4,Biscuits....,"I have too have purchased the 1000 biscuit assortment. For the money it's a fairly good buy. Yes, I have encountered biscuits that are thicker due to moister absorption. Even keeping them in sealed plastic bags will only delay the swelling, and this is a limitation of the material. There is a solution, purchase a ""Biscuit Press"". Tom Foster designed and sells a tool for this very purpose. It allows you to squeeze the thicker biscuits back to a thinner dimension before insertion, and they fit just fine. For more information see Link: [...]After I started using the Biscuit press to compress biscuits to a consistent size just before use I haven't had any problems with too thick biscuits. If you use a lot of biscuits, this tool is a must. This step will eliminate the biggest limitation of this biscuit problems."
3,Biscuits,"I have a small home shop that I do a little work out of. It is important the supplies I buy are right. I will buy another, when I need one, to see if I get the same results."
4,biscuits,I've seen some reviews on these biscuits where some guys had problems with cracked or some other problem with the biscuits but from the order I purchased I may have had a handful broken.I guess the company listened to the reviews and corrected the problem..
5,Great variety at a great price,"You can't get better than the porter-cable biscuits! At this price, and with all the variety contained in this box, it was a great purchase!"
5,Great Value,I have consistently used PC biscuits with no complaints. The 1000 count assortment is a much better value compared to buying them in tubes of 125 biscuits.
5,Just right...,The assortment came and was suitable for use. I liked being able to purchase a variety of biscuits for a reasonable price. Quality was on par with others I have used as well. (How nice do they really have to be?)
3,Change the packing please!,"Biscuits are biscuits, right? Not if they absorb moisture - and biscuits are designed to do just that - so after you get these, take them out of the non-recloseable plastic bags and transfer them to 1 gallon recloseable freezer bags or large jars so they stay good and dry."
3,Not as described,"Advertisement stated this product would contain 4 different size biscuits (O, 1, 2 and FF). FF was missing, they doubled up on another size."
2,Flaky and unfocussed,"I am a passionate lover of mysteries. All kinds of books. Historical, hard-boiled, procedurals. I've been known even to give a whirl to a cozy from time to time. But, unfortunately this cozy is not the one I could possibly recommend to anybody. We learn a lot of details about funeral home bussiness, about a delivery of a baby at home, and all sorts of things not connected with the story. Characters are endlessly annoying and dislikable.And a puzzle, supposed center of the book, just lamely fizzles on last few pages. Unfortunately I have three more books at home written by Ms. Tope. At some point, I will feel compelled to read them to justify the money I spent. Hopefully they are less flaky and unfocussed then this one."
2,zenith lcd display screen,This item was listed that it would fit ps2 slim and also ps2 well my son has the ps2 slim and we didn't open the box cause i read it said fits xbox and ps3 so yeah wasn't even the right one the description was different on the site then it was when we got the item . i did get my money refund on amazon credit but had to pay shipping not credit back co was ok to deal with. but really check into the descriptions on the site cause sometimes if the co is selling it on amazon then it can be different from their store too. found that out.
3,Screen is small,"I am adding my review becuase there is so little information or reviews for this product. I have an older PS2 so I had to go with the 5"" screen, I wish I could have gone with a 7"" screen like they have for the slim. I can see me buying a psp in the future, but for now the Zenith LCD screen serves it purpose. I did have to send it back and get a replacement, becuase it had a small green line running through the screen, but the company I ordered it form has been very helpful. In closeing if you have Ps2 slim there are better and bigger options or if you have the money you can go the psp route"
5,Porter Cable trim router does the gig,"In the company I work with, we've using an older version of this trim router and it has like 8 years old or something, and it is a very useful tool in our work, quick, clean and light machine. I'm normally using DeWalt with other tipe of tools, but there's no reason to take aside this trim router at all. Good quick working tool!!"
1,Lame Base,I've found the height adjustment clumsy and the knurled knob to be hard to sufficiently tighten by hand (it creeps with use). The best trim router out there is their 310P production trim router.
5,"""Classic"" Trimmer","This, the standard to which others are compared, remains a premium contender even with variable, and LED-lit models coming out now. It's small and powerful, with precisely ground guides for the vertical adjustment. One will note that even after Stanley bought Black and Decker, which had earlier bought Porter-Cable, this item remained in production, and will for many years to come."
5,great little thing,"I'm a master carpenter and have 3 of these little routers and I have one dedicated just for door hanging hinge template and the other two set up for two different size rounding over bits, these little routers get used heavily and I have never had any one of the 3 go down."
4,Handy Trimmer,It is a replacment for the trimmer that I used for many years and the bearings went bad I would have put in new bearings but the brushes did not coperate in the taking it apart prosses. But now I have a offset and a strand base so life is twice as good.
3,Not my favorite tool,"I don't care for this tool much. They claim its light. Maybe compared to a full size router, but its a little heavy and awkward. Also, having a clear base would be a lot better. Removing the base is an adventure. Turn the knob off, then the spring goes flying across the shop. When turning this tool on, better hold on. No soft start here.Pros: Its powerful, quality is ok, and the base does hold its position. If you insert and set a bit and use this tool for that single purpose, then I think you'd be better off.All in all, not horrible, but not great either."
3,Just another laminate trimmer.,"I have used a few laminate trimmers, and this one falls into the ""just another"" category. It is well balanced and well priced for the industrial market. If you are a home shop, just use one of your routers that you currently own with a laminate bit.PROS** Lightweight** Well Balanced** Long cordCONS** High price (for home shops)** Just a square base."
4,Great DVD,"I wasn't able to see the game live, but when I saw the DVD available for purchase, I jumped on it. It was the actual broadcast without any commercials. The quality was exceptional and the sound was great. They covered all the instant replays and reviews. They didnt skip a beat. Even though I knew the outcome long before recieving the DVD, I still felt the drama watching the game. I got it in a timely fashion as well."
5,Perfection achieved!!!,"There is not much to say about this DVD, but I am glad I own it because I can now always look back on that awesome game any time I want!!"
1,Celebrate the Cheaters!!!!,"This DVD is a document of how a team wins a national championship by cheating (see Cam Newton). Enjoy it while it lasts Booger (adam), it will be vacated eventually. You see, cheating doesn't pay. Maybe Booger never was taught that lesson as a child in the 80s. Apparantly he was too busy watching horror movies and never was taught how to be a moral person. Enjoy this DVD if you don't care how people cheat to win. You are probably the same people who cheat on your income taxes too, by writing off your colonoscopies."
1,Frustrating for parent and child.,"This book was a total disappointment. I do not feel like it is particularly appropriate for Kindergarten, since implicit in the exercises is that the child already knows how to read. The bright colors distract and detract from the actual study of Reading & Writing. I got this book as part of a set that my daughter now uses as ""coloring books."" There is very little educational value here."
4,Entertainting and blunt expose of oil politics,"A hilarious story with serious messages about prejudice against women in the Middle East, the corruption of wealth, the hypocrisy of certain Islamic nations and the politics of oil."
4,"Great, quick read",We read this book for our book club in Jerusalem. It was a fascinating book! The writing was very interesting and he kept your interest for the entire book. Christopher Buckley is a humorous writer and has a great writing technique. Can't wait to read his other books!
2,Not his best,"I enjoy reading Mr. Buckley's novels especially ""Thank You For Smoking"", however I was very disappointed with this novel. The story never quite jelled. The story seemed rushed and disjointed. He also couldn't decide as to whether to make the novel serious or funny. It is kind of hard to joke about stoning women. I think he was trying to get his point across on how idiotic the Middle East is, but he didn't succeed here. This novel seemed like a rush job. I actually had to read a few of the paragraphs over again in order to try to figure out what he was trying to convey. I commend Mr. Buckley for trying to write about a difficult topic and by trying to throw in some humor along with it. I just wish he had spent a little more time trying to iron out his story."
4,C. Buckley does It Again,"As usual, Christopher Buckley continues to entertain with his novels. The Protaganist is a kick and the story has many twists and turns. I give it 4 of 5 stars as there are even better CB stories out there."
2,Formulaic,Florence of Arabia follows the standared formula for popular fiction. It is not realistic and is based on multiple stereotypes.
5,Hilarious!,"This was a quick fun read about a US State Department employee turned Agent Provocateur (yes, the French play a role) in a thinly-fictionalized Middle East.I won't cover the plot points because I don't want to spoil the surprise. Suffice it that I laughed out loud when I saw the title in the ""New Releases"" section at B&N;, read the first couple of chapters, bought it, and read it in an evening - laughing most of the way (there are some sad parts, but there are more outrageously funny ones.)"
5,This is a Fantastic Read,"Buckley again proves his great talent as a satirist. This is far better than ""Thank You for Smoking"" and a little better than "" Little Green Men"" both of which, were great. By the way the incident of the religious police shoving the female students back into the burning building is true. Despite the fact that this book is based on the truth some of it quite tragic ,as the above incident, Buckley manages to to make this great fun and a terrific read."
3,Fun but educating,I have to believe that the cultural references are real and that is what made the book a good read...the comedy against the reality.
2,It's No 'White House Mess',"Buckley deserves credit for the attempt, and this novel isn't without its charm, but it comes up weak when compared to ""Thank You for Smoking"" and especially ""White House Mess."" I turn to Buckley for over-the-top satire with lots of inside jokes, awash in a true understanding of how things work in Washington. Here his plot is a little too earnest and his characters are weak. The inclusion of a go-get-em former Marine out of central casting made me think Buckley was considering making a screenplay out of this. This was a quick read and it was mostly enjoyable, if a bit canned. But Buckley has done much better with biting wit elsewhere."
1,Uninspirating,"Partial redux of previous book...an obvious attempt to capitalize of fly-fishing mania, as we have seen in the Northwest. Pictures are fair."
5,Great Photography,"Absolutely gorgeous photography mixed with great fishing stories. Which is what fishing is all about- what you see, or say you saw while you were there. An excellent coffee table book that you want to keep picking up time and time again to see the great images."
3,Voyeuristic Enjoyment but Disappointing Text,"Obviously this is a very quick follow on from 'Distant Waters', and you cant help feeling they are cashing in somewhat on the current penchant for flyfishing in exotic places. The photographs are excellent, but much of the text is disappointing. Much of it is just reprinted extracts from old books, even by authors now dead, and the photos and text do not always match up. In short I would say if you want to dream of exotic (and mainly exclusive and expensive) fishing destinations, then this gives great photos, but if you want to read interesting new text to accompany it, you'll be disappointed. Finding old chapters (however well written they were) that I have already got (from David Street,JW Hills, Zane Grey, David Street, Nick Lyons etc) was - I thought - a bit of a con."
3,Lyrical and Italianate,"A warm and passionate account of Massenet's opera, not very French but in this case it's a bonus -- the characters are gutsy and full of life. Tagliavini's very light voice creates the illusion of fragile youth, and the ""Pourquoi me reveiller"" is for once not bawled out as a hit tune; it sounds an organic part of the scene. Gencer's heart-on-sleeve style may sound over the top for some but I love it: this is a Charlotte who indeed might drive a man to suicide. The lighter color of the soprano voice adds a touch of vulnerability to the character, and her full throbbing low notes are sinfully rich. The sound is decent in-house though the orchestra is distant and unresonant."
3,"Fine performance, bad recording","This is a recording of a live show from 1959. The singers sound fine, but the placement of the mics is such that the orchestra sounds like they're playing in a cardboard box somewhere. Sure it's a 2cd set for under ten bucks, but I'd have to recommend looking somewhere else for your copy of this opera."
1,Not worth buying!,"very poor quality, very noisy, several chapters do not work(Amazon should at least publish one of my comments!)"
4,Watch late at night,"I saw this one when it first came out in the theaters, and was impressed with the spooky house and the shrieks and disappearing people. It was anice touch having Klaus Kinski as Edgar Allen Poe. He gave a great performance as a drunken writer obsessed with the supernatural.I recommend this one to you to watch late at night, especially November 2, when everyone at the spooky house comes back to life."
3,"Nice story, but boring","Well, well, well... The story is interesting but due to the fact that the film was made in 1971 its quality is very poor, very dark and hollow audio sound. Also, the scenes are boring... Sometimes you won't understand what is going on or what's happened. I bought it as another film of Michele Mercier which I like so much, but in this film she does not appear bold, and her role is quite boring."
3,Low Budget European Import.,"The only thing more amusing than a cheap domestic horror flick is an imported variety. The unwary viewer must accept Klaus Kinski (of all people) as Edgar Allan Poe. Then we have clean-shaven Tony Franciosa, wearing togs from the 1970s, as the 1840s guy who accepts the inevitable challenge to spend the night in the haunted castle. You get the idea. The film is weird rather than scary. Ghosts abound, but they don't jump out and say, ""Boo!"" The haunting wraiths have other things in mind. The picture begins to resemble a gothic romance, in places. At least it tries to be different. On the plus side, we can award points for effective atmosphere. The film might be considered as camp entertainment, but we aren't sure that the Italian filmmaker had purposeful satire in mind. The entertainment is strictly for die-hard fans of schlock horror flicks. (This reviewer is a master of this type of foolishness). In that context, it is worth collecting. Others beware. ;-)"
5,Handy light,"I had one of these already and it was wearing out, but that was after over 11 years of constant use!"
5,DEWALT DW908 18-Volt NiCd Pivoting Head Cordless Flashlight,great tool to have!! the pivoting head makes it easy to point the light in the direction you need it.
1,Dewalt light,"I have owned one of these lights for years and loved it but the one I bought here on Amazon arrived and it didn't work at all, I changed the bulb to a good bulb and still doesn't work even with a known good bulb and Battery"
4,"Works great, wish it was LED","Used this for a week along with theDEWALT Fluorescent Area Lightfor lighting in the evenings at my cabin. (I can charge batteries at a neighbor's.) It performed well: bright and easily carried with the battery attached. Seems stable on the battery, doesn't knock over easily. I didn't have much cause to use the pivoting head but I can imagine uses where that would be handy. Battery life is decent, but for the price it would be nice if it was LED so you didn't have to worry about bulbs and the battery life would be longer."
4,"great, but needs updated",So far this is a great tool to expand the use of our 18v tool batteries.I wish that DeWalt would update the tool with either an LED lamp or a Xenon lamp opion becuase the lamp it uses is neither super bright nor super efficient.
5,Use and abuse this light,Nothing new. Same as my 12V light that never dies. Gets banged around nicely and works well. Focus feature could be nice tho. As said before- love those bare tool deals.
2,"needs LED, or at least a heavier duty bulb","I bought this really wanting to like it, because I had a big set of 18v tools and a collection of batteries, and several of the other lights that I am happy with. But, it doesn't really ""carry"" comfortably, to carry it while walking around outside (I to live in a rural area will no street lights) you've either got to hold it out in front of you (which is kinda tiring on the arm) or twist the light around to shine straight ""up"" so that it can be held as a normal flashlight, but then the battery hanging off the back keeps it way off balance.So, the ergonomics aren't great, I'd be willing to work around them if the bulbs didn't blow out at the smallest tumble. And, then they want over $9 for a pair (amazon.com pricing, good luck finding them in the store).I really wish they made a decent LED light to use the 18v battery. I'm not going to start buying dewalt tools that use a different battery any time soon, if ever."
3,It's okay,"I bought three of these. One was a gift, the other two were for me. I dropped the first one and the head totally broke at the joint. I thought it was poorly made. I liked using it, so I bought another. I am just more carefull. Great product, could be a little more rigid, since we use it for everyday jobs around the house."
3,American History,"Early American history is related through the use of an ornate chair that is used by higher up people. It relays the struggles the first settlers had in coming to the New England states as far as living conditions, It tells about the conflicts between the French and the English, the many battles that took place. It portrays the struggles the settlers had in establishing a government that would be for the benefit of the new country and how difficult it was to break away from either English or French rule. A grandfather is telling these stories to young children that gather around him to hear his tales."
2,Very uncomfortable,"I don't know that you get any help from this. It is very uncomfortable and feels like it is pulling your teeth up. This should pull straight up on your neck and it feels like it pulls your chin up instead. If I try to keep my chin down, it feels like it is going to pull my teeth out of line. Would not recommend."
2,Just doesn't do the job that a traction system did at the therapist's office,"The traction doesn't make my neck/back feel the same as it did in the pt's office. Nothing wrong with the unit, just not the same results."
4,saving my life,"Love this item. I've been to multiple doctors with neck problems and they all say ""everything looks good"" despite dizziness, neck crunching sounds, and horrific other symptoms. Use this every other day and life is getting back to normal. I paid under $30 for this item and paid $$$$$$$$$$$$ to doctors. This is the only item that has saved me. The only reason I gave it 4 stars and not 5 is because you need someone to help you with the weight bag. Other than that - it's a great product."
4,Easy to setup and use,I found this unit easy to setup and use. It took less than 10 minutes to get it setup and I just leave it hanging on the door in our spare bedroom.
2,Could use some improvements,"It was too difficult to assemble and connect by myself. I modified it by attaching another s-hook to the water weight so I could remove it without disassembling the device. Also, the chin strap needs to be adjustable for a smaller head. I'm an average-sized adult woman and the hook-and-loop straps were too long to make it comfortable so I will modify them also. I guess it boils down to it being inexpensive and ""You get what you pay for."""
3,Trouble with the set up,"I sent this product to my father and he had trouble getting it set up. He seemed to get confused with the collar itself. He said the metal part was strong but he didn't feel comfortable. My sister will be arriving today, and will let me know if Dad wants to keep the unit or return it."
2,"Not what I expected, but great service","This item was not what I expected, but the service was good and quick. Unfortunately, was not able to return it as it was a ""personal product""."
5,Works,"I've used a lot of hydraulic traction devices at the chiro an PT clinics. I prefer this one. I can change the angle with my posture, and it gives more pressure because its my weight vs the counter weight, instead of my body's friction on the floor. Plus, I hung it from the planter hook over the couch and can watch my soaps while sitting up..."
2,An Honest Revew,**I received the item with no issues**I'm not going to give a full review because I tried assembling and wasn't quite sure how to place my chin in the strap**I haven't used it after trying so maybe it's me maybe it's the equipment**Not recommended
4,Works OK,I wasn't expecting much from this product. It can be cumbersom to set and the parts are flimsy and come apart easily but it didn't cost much so I'd say that I got what I paid for. This rating obviously only reflects on my perception of the quality of the item itself and not the seller. It was delivered as promised to my satisfaction.
1,Not Received,I might have given this product more stars if I had gotten the chance to try it. So far it has not been shipped to me. Not happy right now.
1,Dont waste your money..,"Thought it was going to work but no, it hurt me instead. The metal wasn't fitted properly and when you put it up, it might fall off and hurt you. It fell off and hit me because the metal bar isn't properly able to fit into the socket/hole. The chin thing also was cutting into my chin and hurting too. I don't know why other people said it worked for them. That was why I bought it...but sure did not work for me. Hurt me was more like it. I am returning this item."
1,Save your money!,"Don't bother with this one! Doesn't stay in place, flimsey, very hard to find a way to tie off the bag. Looks like the Zimmer model one but not even close."
3,Over the door neck traaction,"It's not the easiest to hook up. I have to have my husband help me. I had one before that was easier, but it still gets the job done. It definitely gives neck traction and makes my neck feel better."
4,replace the bag with handle,"The water bag is clumsy and unnecessary. The metal crosspiece is dangerous and unnecessary. You don't need them. Put the 's' hook directly onto the harness. Instead of a weight or waterbag use a handle tied to the rope. I use a short piece of plastic pipe for a handle. A small hand barbell could be used. I pull on the rope gently and steady for 15 - 30 seconds then release gently. after a few seconds I repeat. I do this for 10 to 20 minutes. The purpose is to stop the muscle spasms (which is the cause of the problem) with out stretching the ligaments to much. Continual pulling for several minutes at a time often causes more spasms, even muscle injury, and stretches the ligaments causing possible further injury because the bones are not held in place properly. Do not continue if this causes pain! And remember to drink more water to inflate the sponge like discs."
3,Works O.K. but takes time to learn how to use it successfully.,"Works O.K. but takes time to learn how to use it successfully as the directions and pictures are more than a little confusing. I found it best to leave it attached to a door in a room that is not used a lot. Also, the pound marks on the water/sand bag are best used only as a guide - put it on a bathroom scale to get a more accurate measure. For effectiveness, you will need over 12 lbs to do any good as most heads weigh close to that! Probably 15 minutes per session is best - you don't need more than that for benefit. Biggest suggestion: instead of sitting with your back to the door, try facing the door and moving your chair out a little. Also, try positioning your chin down a little toward your chest to give more stretch to the back of your neck to separate the cervical disks. This is what my physical therapist told me to do. I think it makes a big difference!"
1,"OTC Over Door Cervical Traction Kit, Complete",Not happy with this device.This product is NOT for anyone with jaw problems!It can cause exacerbation of TMJ and/or loose teeth.There should be a Warning in the product description!
1,AWFUL RETURN POLICY,THERE'S NO ASSISTANCE FOR RETURNS.I'VE PURCHASE 4 ITEMS FROM THIS COMPANY.I HAVE ONE ITEM THAT I DO NOT AND AM FORCED TO RETURN.MY PHYSICIANS ASKED ME TO NOT USE IT BECAUSE OF TMJ ISSUES.NO RMA# PROVIDED. YOU MUST PAY TO RETURN THIS PRODUCT.THEY THEN CHARGE YOU AN OUTRAGEOUS PRICE FOR RESTOCKING.
3,"some flaws, but great price","For the great price, I might purchase again, but would be better aware of some minor flaws. The head mask seems to be too large to be able to adjust down enough for my fit. I adjusted as small as I could and then safety pinned it in place so it would stay. The water bag would be more convenient if it could be removed and placed aside, after using instead it being permanently tied into the rest of the device. Since my knot came loose and whiplashed my neck when it did (kidding, not quite that bad); I found a latch hook like climbers use on ropes that worked very well and tied a more secure knot. Then I could just unhook the water weight to store. Overall, I could tell a benefit after using. My doctor said not to use if all the pull was on the jaw, so I was able to angle the chair to maximize more pull on the back of the head. Also turning toward the door did not work for me, worked better for me facing away from the door."
3,Can't use it,"I give it three stars because it is well-made and inexpensive, but I used it only once and had TMJ for over one week. I used it to try to relieve neck pain, but the pain it caused in my jaw was worse than the neck pain."
4,really happy using it its perfect,"ive got scoliosis and neck curve, ive been using same as this device and its really helpful and good i recommend you guys buying it.for more info contact me Ahmedy__2004@hotmail.com"
3,OTC Over Door Cervical Traction,"The device is well made material. I used it several times, but it does not help my neck problem much, so I did not use it any more at this time."
3,"Dang me, dang me, they ought to take a rope and hang me.","This works to put traction on the cervical spine and relive some of my symptoms. The reason I've not given it a higher rating is that it's cumbersome to set up and get the bag weight set to your personal preference. I'm also going to build a braket so I don't have to mount it ""over the door""."
3,Exactly what I expected,"A few problems with the design:1. The pulleys have way too much space between the wheels and the brackets holding them, so the cord slips off the wheel and jams. Probably fixable by just bending the bracket a bit.2. The nibs that keep the pulley hanger in place cause the pulleys to get caught and jammed when you hang it. Maybe some sort of washer will fix that one.3. The head halter is too small. I can barely get the end of the velcro to connect, and I feel like it'll strangle me. Did they send a childs unit?Also, very minimal instructions. Be sure to get instructions from a doctor before using this."
3,poor sewing on chin strap,"After setting up the cervical traction kit, I noticed that one of the straps I'm supposed to secure under my chin was sewn on backwards. It isn't worth returning, so I took it off and repaired it. But I'm glad I saw it as it may have been dangerous to use it as is....."
5,A must-read book!,The book awakens national consciousness.It is an inspiration to those who dream of true freedom and oneness.
5,Fits right in to our family,"Loved this made very well, was a great surprise. Have this on my mantel to represent my daughter as a fire fighter"
1,Take a pass...Nothing new here.,Repetitious. Long-winded. Over-hyped. Over-rated. Disappointing. Read the first 5 pages in book store and redeploy your capital elsewhere.
3,"Great examples, worth the read.","Great examples from business and sports. Should have read the actual copy instead of listening to the author, good instructor, not a professional reader, maybe it was me. Learned a great deal."
1,A waste of time and money,"This was an impulse buy that I now regret. In retrospect I wish I had first gone to Amazon to check the unusually high number of 1-star reviews this book has received.The core message is that winning leads to more winning by attracting resources and talent and building confidence. Likewise, losing leads to more losing by detracting resources and investment and eroding team confidence. A losing organization can turn itself around by building up the three pillars of confidence: accountabilty, collaboration, and iniative/innovation.The book's message could have been expressed in 1/3 of the space. Instead you have to wade through one repetitive story after another, mainly from high school and college football, ad nauseum.My advice is to save your money and look for something better."
2,"30,000 foot? or 40,000---whatever its HIGH LEVEL","WHile an easy read, I found this book content free. We whould be 'confident' and 'communicate ' and collaborate' ; we should face losses w/o denial, but confront them. Wow, what insight.Its like reading a book of what you should do , adding some sports stories and with no specific practical application about what to do Monday morning....but be Confident ;)"
1,Poorly written resource for outdated/irrelevant/80s concepts,"There's not an ounce of meat in this book.This book features a steady stream of the author's self-praise and excessive ""name-dropping"". The ""conclusions"" are certainly not original. The thesis of the book is never really developed and the text is directionless and slow."
1,"This book is boring, tedious, and thoroughly uninspiring","I can't believe the average customer review is greater than 4 stars! This book was a chore to read; I will admit that I could not drag myself throught he entire text. And I mean ""text"". This book was written like a textbook. I felt I back in college slogging through my required reading. This book was written as if someone did a whole bunch of research (using many different grad students of course), then tried to compile all the data into a book. The problem is, anybody can do that, but few can do that well. The writer loses the reader in all those details, forgeting to stick to the basics, highlight them with interesting examples, and repeat them often. I know she probably thinks she did this, and she did, just not well. I've never seen such an interesting topic made so boring."
5,Excellent book on winning in life,Rosabeth Kanter uses relevant case studies to show us how confidence produces winning streaks in every walk of life. This book provides a unique perspective on this heretofore unexplored requisite for success. It is enlightening. Another worthwhile and compelling book that should not be missed if you want to learn how to be emotionally self-reliant and make the most of every situation is Optimal Thinking: How To Be Your Best Self.
1,Where's the beef?,"I was actually shocked that a Harvard prof could write a book so light. Be confident, communicate? Good one. How much is tuition there?Many, many other books on the market that have much more depth.Do yourself a favor and pass on this shallow and ridiculously simple book."
4,A Useful Book,"Generally geared towards leadership and organizational traits, this book was useful. One fault I can comment on is that there was an over-emphasis on sports analogies."
1,Money for nothing,In a nutshell this is a very expensive 11 page biography followd by almost 200 hundred pages of bibliography. The biography has nothing that is not well know to Simon's fans. The bibliography can be gotten for a lot less money with a good search engine. Even with a casual glance at the bibliography ommisions were apparent.
4,GET IT!,This game rocks! It has great game play and if you like this kind of first person stuff then youll like this game. Graphics arent the best but no to bad but the gmaeplay is pretty fun. Swat 2 and Swat 3 demo were my favs. If you dont like this then get rainbow six Rogue spear.
4,Never go hungry,"I have seen homeless and hungry begging for food while standing among tons of acorns laying on ground. Something is wrong in this country when there is clearly enough land and resources to provide all the food necessary for all people. Even wild food is abundance. I read this booklet and was stunned by the wisdom employed by the indians in storing up nine years of acorn in case of famine. No one told them what to do, they just did it. Hardships and experience showed them the need to do so. We are so ""advanced"" we've created government to do it for us and Homeland Security views us as security threats if we store more than three months supply? Today, we import much of our food from China. Remember the poor starving Chinese? Does anyone remember the soup lines? Self-sufficiency, now there's a new phrase!"
2,Not as helpful as other books out there,"I found the descriptions of the personality types good, but the practical advice in how to deal with those types and specifically the combinations of types lacking.I went back and read some of my other child development books and found they not only had a lot of the same information, but much more practical advice in how to deal with them. Mary Sheedy Kurcinka's Kids, Parents, and Power Struggles is a terrific one. The information on the temperament types is more brief, but again, you can get the gyst pretty easily, and the practical side is much richer... and that, for me, was more important. In addition, the Power Struggles book also covers the parent's personality type and how to work your temperament WITH your child's and know where the danger zones are."
4,Stylish & Substantial,"Great weight and feel on the watch. Keeps good time with great lume for night viewing. The mother of pearl dial is a great touch; very stylish. Excellent watch at this pricepoint. It's on the ""big"" side too(47mm case) which I think adds to its' appeal. Well worth the buy."
5,Must Have!,I was looking for Pin Up Art Styles and found it all in this book. All the styles are for men & women. When You go into a tattoo shop and look at all the art work on the walls and books; this book has it all summed up. This cool book has it all.
3,alright,I thought the stencils were going to be a little more graphic than they were. They were sloppy looking and all looked like a kids doodling book
3,Sailor Jerry's Tattoo's,Simple book. Mostly pictures of tattoo designs. Not a lot of written information about the history of these tattoo's.
4,"Extremely worthwhile album, a lot of fun","Karl Denson, tenor sax player for the San Diego-based Greyboy All-Stars, has produced an excellent album, guaranteed to make toes tap at your next house party. To call this acid jazz misses the point somewhat, given the mediocre quality of many performers in that genre. This is groove-oriented jazz, I have no idea why Karl and the rest of his Greyboy band mates aren't signed on Blue Note & making huge waves at jazz festivals all over the world. There are not only some great chops on this album, it's got great compositions and some intricate, complex interplay unheard in trendier groups. This album won't change the world, but it is a heck of a good time."
5,Really nice photo printer,This is my first photo printer and I couldn't be happier. The clarity and quality of the pictures is great. Just make sure you only use Canon photo paper with this printer. I originally used kodak premium photo paper and the quality of the photo prints was awful.
2,Not so thrilled....,"It seems like most people are happy with this printer but I am less then thrilled. I bought it because I love my Canon digital camera and they had a rebate if I bought this printer.After setting it up, I printed my first photo and the picture seemed fuzzy, it also had an excess amount of pink tone to it. I printed a few more and each time I got the same result. i called Canon customer service, which was EXCELLENT, but the tech could not make it work to my satisfaction so I returned it.I decided to try again becaue I really wanted the $100 Canon rebate. I went to Best Buy with my compact flash card and printed a test print from my CF.....same thing fuzzy and this time too much yellow. I tried the HP 7960......LOVED IT....looked much more realistic BUT it's quite a bit more in price and no rebate.I decided to buy the HP 7760 and so far I love it!!!! Great prints for the price!"
2,Short lived,"When it worked it was a great printer. It died on me 20 days out of the one year warranty. Won't print a thing now. If you buy this printer, better get an extended warranty. Canon has left a bad taste in my mouth."
4,Canon out colors HP,"Can't decide between this machine and the HP 7960? I've tried them both and this is the winner.The print quality is much warmer, HP felt a little sterile. The Canon machine feels more substantial, the HP felt cheap and skidded across the desk. On the downside, the LCD on the Canon isn't very clear and the set up takes a little longer. Overall, Canon is the winner, add a $... in your pocket and quicker printing, and the answers easy."
4,THE TOUCH,"THIS MOVIE WAS A SURPRISE TO ME SINCE I DID KNOW OF KEVIN COSTNER BEING IN IT, SO MUCH FOR MOVIEFONE LISTING ALL THE MOVIES A STAR IS IN. VERY EARLY MOVIE WITH KEVIN COSTNER BEFORE HE BECAME A MEGA STAR. NOT THAT GREAT BUT HAD TO ADD IT TO MY COLLECTION."
5,The Cat in the Hat Beginner Book Dictionary,"Excellent book. It was the favorite of my youngest son, who is now age 50. Because he still remembers it as his favorite childhood book, I have purchased dozens of this book as gifts for young children. All of them have also loved it."
5,Très bon,C'est un livre que je connais. Il a été utilisé pour mes enfants. Et à présent je vais l'utiliser pour mes petits-enfants
3,good,I bought it for my 5 years old grand-daughter. I think it was not for her. Maybe for younger kids.
4,Classic Dr. Seuss in a Dictionary,This is a fun book for kids to look through as they learn to find words in a dictionary- or for ideas for school projects. We use picture dictionaries to help build vocabulary and as a visual tool in language development.
1,Lame,"I really liked some of the reckless, nihilistic, absurdist material on DAF's ""Die Kleinen und die Bösen"", so I decided to check out this album. I feel ripped off.It's a bunch of very short clips of aimless, poorly recorded cacophony, spliced together in a rather artless fashion. It sounds like a poorly organized teenage punk band practicing interminably in the garage next door. The clips are over before you even have a chance to get your musical bearings. It's like listening to a rehearsal tape, warts and all.Check out ""Die Kleinen und die Bösen"" instead."
3,Straight Breaks,"This isn't really an 'album' in the common sense of the word -- it's a collection of sampled percussion loops with some melodic bass guitar and/or sax thrown in. So unless you're something of a musician looking for some funky rhythm tracks to fook with, this disc probably isn't for you. No disrespect to the Greyboy, as there are really some fine beats to be found here."
4,"Good background, lounge style music...","DJ Greyboy always puts out consistently great beats and music that is fun to listen to. This album is no different. To the reference below about A Tribe Called Quest...their album came out long before this album so I wouldn't say they got the beat off track 1 from DJ Greyboy. Also, Tribe uses that beat for ""Luck of Lucien"" not ""I Left my wallet in El Segundo""."
1,Disappointed......,The pictures in this book are beautiful. The sentiment was sweet too. My 4-year old didn't connect to it at all. He was confused by all the different branches of the military being included and the Mommy being deployed scared him to death! Poor thing just had Daddy leave him. He doesn't need to wonder about Mommy leaving too. We gave this book away..... :(
4,"Some great tracks, others not so much","Not much else to say.. Very nostalgic and worth it if you're into that sort of thing. These are industrial-ish covers of Crue songs, though, not really remixes.I do have one response to a previous review -- this is NOT TECHNO, not by a longshot. Does it make use of electronic instruments? Yes. Everything with a synth in it isn't techno, and calling it such just illustrates ignorance. <end of rant/>"
2,Only if your a Die Hard Crue Head,"I saw the names of all the cool singers on this cd track listing and thought this will be good, how wrong I was the only two tracks that come close to being rock or close to the originals were the two versions of Shout at the Devil. Unless your a Die Hard Crue Head, don't buy this cd its not worth it and frankley I expected more from the cool singers on this cd,and why anyone would want to remix Tracii Guns guitar tracks has got me beat as he does most of the guitar tracks on th cd. Not happy from down under mate."
2,Motley Remix,"Motley Crue is the greatest rock band on the planet. ""Shout at the Remix"" is ok, but make sure you want to buy a Motley Crue TECHO tribute album. If you liked Generation Swine, this one will be right up your alley. Steve Summers version of Live Wire is the best song on the album."
4,Great program!,"I love this program with a few exceptions. It would be so much better if the report templates were easier to change/create, you could attach files to email templates for mail merge docs being sent to lookups/groups and didn't slow your system down so much. Otherwise, I use it everyday and can't imagine my business without it."
2,Not so helpful for upper elementary,"The watercolor pencil book has projects to practice each lesson. This sketch kit has good information, but I will have to walk my 5th grader through it. The guide gives a lot of info. I think it may be in a logical progression, but it's not spelled out for non-art people."
4,Just what the title says,"If you're looking for background music, this isn't it: Ball's fine harp accompaniment is used to enhance a series of (mostly traditional) tales. This is an album you have to LISTEN to -- you can't just put it on and fill out your Form 1040 or tangle with rush-hour traffic. As a storyteller Ball is a pleasure to hear, tasteful (I loathe performers who overdo a fake Irish brogue!), and has a wonderful sense of drama that brings even the more familiar stories to life. I've heard him do most of this material in person, and I think that without the audience a recorded version will always be second best. Still, it's stimulating, and some of the tales will have you weeping into your ginseng tea."
4,Dewalt / Millwaukee 12 volt bulb,Bulb Worked Perfect in my Milwaukee M12 Flashlight. Just wish bulb was brighter. Still Cant Figure out why Milwaukee dose not make a bulb.
2,For old Pixter games only -- NOT the new Color Pixter,"I purchased this item for the color Pixter my son received for his birthday. However, the color Pixter is a completely different shape, and therefore, made this one unusable. I hope that they come out with a color version, I like the idea of being able to hold the game and a few cartridges together -- especially for travel."
4,BODY BUMPIN IS THE BOMB!,"This cd was bangin! Me and all my friends pump it in our rides and in our cribs. Its not just one song, the whole album is the bomb!"
4,Who needs R.Kelly anyway? Not these guys.,"A great album for P.A. My favorite song would have to be ""Turn The Hands"" because of the meaning and just plain sound of it. The only song that is kind of annoying is D.O.G with Shaq. Besides that it's great. And R.Kelly hasn't made an album like thisin his career."
2,boring smooth soul,"Sorry people, but I found this album extremely boring. A smooth boring soul album with smooth boring songs and a smooth voice that doesn't stick out."
1,"Bad design, Breaks quickly","* a part broke within first 6 months of ownership.* customer service is poor* 3 months after being in electrolux recommended shop, still not fixed* shut off switch on canister versus wandyou can do better"
1,Overall the design is just fair and the quality is junk,"This is a great vacuum as long as it doesn't break, which it does all the time. Thankfully, when I bought it I got a good enough deal to spring for the extended warranty since it has been to the shop repeatedly."
2,Swedish model,I have owned an electrolux vacuum for over 30 years and recently decided to buy a new one (by the way the old one still works) and have been doing research for the last week when I came across this product. I was surprised that it did not look like the typical electrolux vacuum(which has the same basic look for years). This product is made by Electrolux in sweden and it is hard to find parts because Electrolux USA is not involved with this vacuum. That is why you are having trouble finding parts. By the way - Electrolux USA has changed its name to Aerus/Electrolux and still has the same quality vacuums as the one I own. I have been told that the Oxygen is a good product but since it is not made by the same electrolux USA company people are mislead into believing that they can go to any Electrolux dealer for service which isn't so.
1,I agree with Drew M ...... the worst vacuum I've ever spent $300 on,"Everything Drew (the single guy) said is true. I would never buy this again, and am not ever sure that I'd feel right selling it used to anyone. My biggest complaints - it tips over at the slightest hangup on a piece of furniture or doorway, the fact that the handle only turns one say (Drew is right...it's absurd...and my hand hurts afterwards from trying to keep the power nozzle in line), and my retractable cord is broken after about four uses..it won't retract any longer.Don't buy it - shop around a bit."
1,Would not buy again....,"I purchased this vacuum back in July of 2005. When it works it seems to be a very fine vacuum. This vacuum has been in the shop no less than 3 times for various issues. Each time I waited several months because repair parts were not readily available. This last time when the on/off switch failed the shop told me it was connected to a electrical PC board the repair would be $200. That was enough, and I scraped it. Some may say 6 years is a good life, but the Kenmore it replaced was 10+ of solid performance. If you are going to spend for a high end vacuum, stay away from Electrolux. Better yet, ask you local repair shop."
1,Big Mistake,"I wish I had read the reviews on this vacuum before I purchased it. I have owned it for less than five months and, as of yesterday, am the satisfied new owner of a Dyson. I became so frustrated everytime I used it. I could not believe the issues with the power nozzle always turning to the right. I showed it to several people and they all had the same opinion as me, it is the worse design ever. Although I thought the suction was good, I ran the electrolux and then followed up with the Dyson and it was just amazing how much dirt, dust, carpet fuzz.... was picked up by the Dyson after I thought the rug was clean from the electrolux. Customer service was very poor from Electrolux. I emailed 3 times before I got a response which said that I needed to call customer service. They just said they designed the vacuum with the wayward power head and there was nothing they would/could do. Do not buy this vacuum."
1,Electrolux Oxygen ultra cleaner,"I believed I was purchasing an Electrolux product. Instead, as it turns out, I have purchased a Eureka vacuum with an Electrolux name on it. If I had wanted a Eureka vacuum I would have purchased one -- and it would have been less expensive.This vacuum is a piece of junk.Dont make the same mistake that I did.Dont Buy It."
1,Do not buy this vacuum cleaner!,I bought this vacuum cleaner last October. Do not buy this product! It began falling apart as soon as I started using it. The crappy plastic clip will not hold the head to the wand and no one has been able to fix it. It is cheaply made and not really that easy to use. Buy something else or you'll be spending alot of time going to the repair shop. Electrolux does not want to deal with it and would not exchange the vacuum cleaner. Next stop- complaints to consumer agencies.
5,One of the Best,"Hello everyone, J.T. Watkins is one of the best bluesman of all times and this cd is evidence of that. A very good cd, I enjoyed it thoroughly."
3,reproduction,this sword is a remake of a kit rae orginal. my friend has the orginal and it's bigger then this one! so for those of u who think it's the full size it's a short sword.other then the cheap plastic handle and mediocre leather sheath it's great. nice display peace or zombie killer. wouldn't take it to a duel though.
1,lemon,I have had this set for less than two years and although the set performs well it continues to blow power supplies. I'm not exactly sure what the part is but it is respsonsible for driving the picture. Anyway Lg has offered to pay for the new part however I would have to pay the labor somewhere between $100. and $135. Quite frankly I believe at this point the set has an inherent problem and don't want to put anymore money into. I'm certain it will happen again.Again I am very happy with the set when it's working but after spending almost $700. for it less than two years ago to throw $100. plus into it every 10 months or so is crazy.
4,I love Carpenters,"Carpenter are a legend. They are the greatest brother/sister duo I have ever listened to. They are my favorite. I own only two of their compilation CDs. One is this one and the other is GOld. They are a real treasure i must say. My all time favorite is Top of the world, Good bye to love, Rainy days and Mondays, Sing. I tell you everything in this collection is a gem. Not one can be compared to the other. Even though these songs are decades old they still hold that freshness. Karen Carpenter was one in a million. Who knows what the Carpenters would have acheived if they were still alive today. Trust me you must own atleast one cd by carpenters if not more"
3,"The Carpenters do these well, but not all my cup of tea","Nice album and the songs sound tuneful to match the theme...maybe it is too much of an overload for me here, but an ok album."
4,Karen Carpenter,"Karen's voice is beautiful. She sings wonderful songs and I love this album. My favorite song is ""Make Believe It's Your First Time"". It seems so real...one feels like you're in the song. It really is a good album and is worth buying."
5,All the best of the Carpenters,"This CD is the Carpenters at their best. Listening to all the great love songs from the years gone by can only bring back memories when they were on the top. Listening to Karen sing ""Solitaire"" is unbelievably beautiful, along with ""Superstar"", ""We've only just Begun"", and the other seventeen songs on the CD. It's a CD worth buying."
5,Its a great collection of the best Carpenters songs!,"I love the Carpenters, and I can finally find all of my favorites on 1 cd. Karen would be very proud!"
5,The Warmest Voice in Pop Music History,"For those Carpenters non-fanatics who are looking for a good compilation (of the seemingly hundreds that Richard keeps churning out), this is the best place to start. Despite its mundane title, each song on here is a classic and, collectively, reaffirms the brilliance of Richard's arranging/producing, and, above all, the warmth and genius that was Karen Carpenter."
4,Over-produced!,"As much as I adore Karen Carpenter's voice, I'm just shocked by what's been done to it on this collection. It's almost obscured by the multi-layered production and arrangements that made me wonder if Richard had re-mixed this album for quad (I was listening on headphones)! Too many electronic enhancements on her vocals.I would have given this collection 5 stars, but the remixing just ruined it for me. I can remember back when the albums were actually sonically relaxing. Now they sound as if Richard has too much time on his hands.Let Karen's vocals shine, please, and leave the electronics off!Dec 7, 2007: OK, maybe I was too harsh; Karen is served lovingly here by Richard, but overall the production still sounds like it was taped off an FM MOR station. Especially the rhythm section. Too much limiting."
5,Brings Tears to your eyes...,"I listen to this CD over and over again. I am at a loss for words what this voice means to me. So pure, innocent, perfect, melodic. I am resigned to believe that a similar voice will not come along again in my lifetime. The arrangements, the keyboards, the melody and harmony, Karen's VOICE! Nobody has ever duplicated this sound, nor will they. I remember playing these songs for a terminally ill friend of mine, by the time the CD was finished, he was in tears. He could not believe the purity of Karen's voice. It really is a shame that her voice left this world at such a young age. Karen lives on in our hearts and minds, and comforts us in our daily lives with the legacy she left behind."
3,Breezy and Slender,"OOOHHH! MS. Carpenters loud whispers of love and affection while banging drums loudly only adds to the Carpenter's mystique. They are endlessly listenable, and probably great with aged wine. A skating rink must!"
5,Wonderful album!!,"Anything that Karen Carpenter sings is gorgeous! Many of the same favorites, but just a beautiful collection of love songs specifically. How can you do any better? I know we will run out of cuts that this amazing lady made, but it is just a joy to hear her clear voice, always right on the pitch, the timbre of her voice appropriate to the song, and seemly reaching right through the speakers and grabbing your attention and your heart. Way to go, Karen!!"
5,Great CD,"I love the Carpenter's and this CD has a great selection of their love songs. I play it all the time.If you like the Carpenters, you will love this CD too."
2,No birds,"There have been no squirrels at this caged feeder, but also there are no birds. It is hanging next to an uncaged finch feeder where the birds visit daily, but they will not go through the cage to get the food."
5,VERY GOOD EXTENTION CORD,USING IT FOR MY BEDROOM AIR CONDITION IN AN OLD APARTMENT BUILDING(OVER 100 YEARS OLD). SINCE THE OUTLET WAS ON THE OTHER SIDE OF MY BEDROOM. WORK GREAT!
2,OOPS! Wrong Color!,"this arrived yesterday and to my surprise it is BRIGHT ORANGE!!! since it was for use in our bedroom, it's really not going to work."
3,Winds of Evil Review,"I thought that Winds of Evil was really good. I liked the characters, they were interesting and all of them had some type of a dark past. I really enjoyed the plot, as well. It was a little scary thinking about demons really trying to take over the world, or even just a little town like Eden. But I like that this is a strong book of faith, and that the author shows that. No matter what happens, we must always trust in God. I give the book a three, because I like the characters and plot, though there are some parts that still confuse me."
3,Nothing special here,"I found this book on clearance and thought it sounded interesting. But I was disappointed. This book wasn't anything like I thought it would be.First, I didn't get much of a sense of place. Even though Eden was a small town, it didn't really feel like a small town.I also found the characters to be very flat and predictable. It got very annoying after all. There was Katy-the former Christian with a dark past, Josh-the good ole boy reporter, Enoch Jones, the faithful pastor, and a few others who were equally unremarkable. The good characters were completely good and the bad were really bad.For fans of this genre, I would recommend ""This Present Darkness"" and ""Piercing the Darkness"" by Frank Peretti. He is a master storyteller and knows how to write an excellent supernatural thriller that will keep you on the edge of your seat. I don't think I will be reading the rest of this series."
3,The decline and fall of American manufacturing,"This router could be the poster child for everything wrong with the current state of tool manufacturing in the U.S. This is a brilliantly designed router given that it was designed 30 years ago. Unfortunately no effort whatsoever has been made to upgrade the design in subsequent years. Most notable is the lack of a self releasing collect. Router bits repeatedly get stuck in the collect requiring a sharp tap to release them. By addressing this and other minor problems this machine could be a competitive product for another 30 years but there is literally no meaningful creative design effort going on in virtually any american tool manufacturer at the moment. Most companies are simply shells for asian manufacturers who crank out decades old designs at basement prices. This particular router is not even sold at a basement price.Tool design innovation is almost completely given over to european manufacturers, particularly Festool."
1,Shipping,Amzn shipping took way too long for me to give this product a positive review- I recommend purchasing elsewhere. Many eBay sites ship same-day.
5,Great Product but beware,This product works great! BUT...it sells all over the place for $159.00 most with free shipping. These people that Amazon subs out to could care less about customer satisfaction and won't refund the difference or adjust their price. LOOK ELSEWHERE.
3,weak base plate design,"I have used this router many years ago in a cabinet shop that did laminate trimming on a daily basis. Although It did a fine job trimming and felt great in the hand the one major flaw is the motor base does not fully support the base plate, hence if this router is dropped and is hit at the unsupported base it will crack off, after all these base plates are hard brittle plastic. Being a production router, used everyday, as careful as you are this can happen eventually. What does make this a nice trimmer is that it is not at all top heavy (common with trimmers)."
1,"Crazy Author, Stupid Book",This is a BORING book. Most of the chapters are just pointless stories. Neil Postman is nothing but a critic. Avoid.
2,This book could use some healing,"Michael Blumlein is clearly a very intelligent and creative writer. This book paints an interesting picture of a world where healers are second class citizens. The problem, however, is that the picture isn't very deep.Blumlein falls into the habit early in the book of waiting until the last possible moment to explain a new term he's using. Yes, it's interesting that there are Unerrants and Orts and melis and musk, but it would have been MORE interesting if he explained it the first time he mentioned it rather than forcing me to reread the chapter.He also tends to misuse pronouns, especially in dialog, (When you say ""she said"", tell me which SHE said it!) leading to confusing passages for the reader.As for the ending, rather than finding it grand or mythical, I found it rather nonsensical and weird.The concept of this book is very good and well thought out, however the excecution of it leaves something to be desired."
2,Odd story,"I think what bothered me about this story was that healers are second class citizens discriminated against. This novel was written by a doctor. I've met few doctors who wasn't arrogent, pompous creeps who treat their patients like idiots. Because of that, I couldn't enjoy this book."
4,Porter Cable 5563 Face Frame Plate Joiner Biscuits - 175 Per Tube,"Not used yet, but was reasonably packaged and I just put into a jar with screw lid. No complaints."
4,very nice,"like storage and easy to access can see what is inside and stores nicely on a shelf, would recommend it"
4,"Great player, doesn't play DVD-R though","While this player accommodates just about every DVD with flawless quality on playback and excellent sound, it doesn't play DVD-R or other recorded formats (likely due to Sony's policy of not supporting 'self-archived media'). Other than that, it has a very nice menu system, easy to use remote and supports up to 5-discs."
4,CD/DVD Player,This is the only one that can play 5 CD's and a DVD in one unit. I wish that someone could come up and manufacture another unit like this. I had to get this unit as a used unit and so far it is doing the job it set out to be. If this breaks down I will have to buy two separate units to do the same job as this one is doing.
3,average,"You think Sony, you think quality. This DVD player served us well for 3 years until an electrical storm toasted the power system. Would have cost over $200 to fix, so we just bought a new one.It was very sensitive to dust, and many DVDs had to be wiped."
3,Fun But A Bit Mechanical,"This is a fun book from the inventive Sean McMullen. A fantasy rather than sci-fi book set on a parallel universe where the world orbits a gas giant, there are anatomically different forms of humans, and there is a science of magic. The plot concerns the efforts of various factions to obtain and control a magical doomsday device. This book has many of the attractive features of his very enjoyable Greatwinter Trilogy. A large cast of characters, a complex but generally entertaining plot, clever plot devices, and a good deal of humor. The plot does tend to overpower the characters. McMullen showed in his book The Centurion's Empire that he can do a better job of character description. Good vacation reading."
4,"Creative, but dense and mystifying","Lenine is one of Brazil's best modern rock/trip-hop artists, a key player in the revitilzation of their current indie scene. On this album he continues further along in his explorations of densely-layered, loose-grooved, weirdly concieved trip-pop, kind of similar to material by Ben Neill and David Holmes in the English-speaking pop world. This may be a bit dense for most the casual listener, but anyone looking for challenging, original material out of Brazil (or just out of their own frame of reference) will want to check this out. (For similar music, try Arnaldo Antunes, Arto Lindsay, or Caetano Veloso)."
4,Fine Example of Nielsen at his best,"I don't listen to much opera, rather, I approached this recording as a Nielsen completist looking to round out my collection. This fine opera (four acts on 2 CDs) is a good example of Nielsen in the amiable style of his middle years (circa Symphonies 2 and 3). Nice clean melodic lines. Curiously, this performance is in English. Though I still can't understand too much of the text, It has the sound of a biblical oratorio.I am very glad somebody took this little gem out of the vaults. For 10 bucks it is a nice neat little package, though there is no libbretto. Sonics are good for the early 70's but not outstanding.Also of note, this is one of Jascha Horenstein's last recordings."
5,More than satisfied,"I purchased the DeWalt 12-volt NiCad pivoting head flashlight (w/o battery). It arrived promptly and was very well packed. It was first quality and exactly as described. I plugged a charged battery in and it worked as it should. I use it every day in my work and it is durable and takes a lot of punishment, dropped, bounces around in the back of a P/U truck, scooted & dragged along the ground, tossed from person to person etc. Excellent product."
3,Decent flashlight,"If you've already got the batteries from the Dewalt 12-volt drill, it makes sense to get the flashlight. I got this for a good price and it functions as you would expect a flashlight to. Nothing too fancy -- decent level of brightness. I'm not real fond of the function of the pivoting head -- you have to turn the head clockwise to hit specific pivot points, at which you would need to adjust the direction the flashlight was pointed in (as opposed to just ratching up and down on the same plane as I've experienced on other brands like the Porter Cable). It's not a problem but it's not the best design out there. Again, if you want to make the most use of your batteries, there aren't a whole lot of options."
5,Outstanding,I was buying this as a replacement for the one I have. The new light is a better light than the one I have. My battery fits in this light better. The quality is great. If you need a long lasting and great quality light buy this one. I am very happy with this light. I have the drill and 2 batteries plus the charger.The light help when working outdoor and in dark places. This light is very bright and the battery last a long time with out having to be recharged. Need light this is it.
4,Great utility!,"I gave it 4 stars - 5 stars for its usefulness and 3 for its build quality. I have several cordless tools from different makes, so I'm not using up the batteries all the time like I'm supposed to from what I've read, but having this flashlight around helps me at least cycle through my DeWalt 12V batteries. The flashlight has a lightweight feel to it without the battery installed, so it clerly doesn't feel as ""heavy duty"" or solid as, let's say, a drill might feel, but I figure what should I expect? Maybe the yellow and black color scheme along with the DeWalt label makes me expect more? But, heck, it's only a flashlight! You can't vary the beam width as you can with a MagLite but you can pivot the head which has proven useful at least once. Lastly, I'm not quite sure how I ever got by without a flashlight in the shop! My final recommendation is that if you have a cordless kit from any make, get the matching accessory flashlight!"
5,BRIGHT AS HECK! AWESOME!,"If you are sick of constantly buying batteries, and never having a flashlight handy, buy this gem. It's awesome, especially if you already have sunk a few hundred into other dewalt products and wish you could use those batteries for something else! It's bright and takes a beating!"
3,False impressions,"Simplistic, amateurish thriller. Jeffrey Archer's writing skill - if indeed he wrote this trash - is well past it's sell by date. Pity one can't get a refund!"
2,False Impression ... indeed,"False Impression... indeed ! Although I liked most of Archer's books, I'm sorry to say I found this to be a too perfunctorily written thriller."
2,a book full of stereotypes,"this book is quite boring. it's based on a relatively interesting plot and the author appears to have good knowledge in art and art trading. but all the characters in the book are so boring and they do everything either in a completely expectable way, or in unreasonable ways. everything is like black and white... i had serious trouble finishing the book by the time I came to about 3/4 of it. i summoned up my courage and finished it and really regretted it. i gave it a 2 star because i did appreciate the effort the author put in in describing the art work and trading and some of the 9.11 description..."
4,Nice & Suspenseful Until.............,"I found the book very well written & the story nicely entwined with it's characters. There's no long, descriptive lead in. The story hits the ground running. The novel held my interest throughout. I was a bit disappointed with it's ending. Not so much as to what happens with the villains; rather the last pages could have been left unwritten. A good thriller which ends with it's last few pages as soupy & corny as a soap opera"
4,No stone left unturned in this thriller,"This is a superb classic thriller that offers unsurpassed insight as well as foresight in human passions and foibles in this jittery post 9/11 era. His description of bad acts and bad thoughts are so real, palpable and gripping albeit a bit unreadable at times and yet his noble spirit of statesmanship shines through as I read passages like [he] is straight from ""the Bronx to ... Brooks Brothers"" attire and room ""blazing with light"" and finally at the end of the story in a banter where the conversation lends itself to a possibility of disagreement he says, ""You are not Irish."""
2,Good Start but poor Ending ...,"The story starts on a good pace but dies along as you turn the pages ..its so boring , no real plot .."
2,Trying to fill in for Robert Ludlum?,"I fell in love with Jeffrey Archer, slowly, after reading books like First Amount Equal, Prodigal Daughter, Honor Among Thieves. I have all the books written by the author in my library. All these books have one thing in common, the author takes time to build the key characters. Through the pages, I could see their world in my head. Then I read the short stories and enjoyed every one of them like a curious kid.I was very excited when I picked up this book. I could hardly believe what I was experiencing. This book has a pace and feel of Robert Ludlum. A normal life protagonist is suddenly thrown into a world of international chase through the dark characters and all of a sudden the the hero beats James Bond (of course Jason Bourne is better).The book is predictable and lacks research. Maybe I was expecting a Twist in the Tale!"
2,Dissapoinment all over,Not exactly an Archer fan but he has done in the past readable books and now we have a so so one. Only for the very fans of the author.
4,Typical Archer...Solid Story,"I've been reading Jeffrey Archer since 1977...and I've never been disappointed with his stories. This one is as solid as it gets. I've been reading a lot of other writters lately who forget about finishing their books, so it was refreshing to read something that tied up all the loose ends."
3,Not Archer's best,"There are certain authors who have written really great books, and when they write a story that is less than their best, it's hard to be totally objective. KANE AND ABEL, HONOR AMONG THIEVES, and SONS OF FORTUNE have set an almost unattainable standard for Archer. FALSE IMPRESSION is not a bad story by any means, but it just isn't as good as it should be from a writer of Archer's caliber. I found the plot and characters to be very cookie-cutter thriller. It was a quick read and somewhat engaging, but I felt unconnected to the characters to say nothing of the somewhat preposterous story."
2,At least it wasn't the DaVinci Code,"When I read the liner notes, I was worried that Archer was going to turn to Brown's formulaic and excruciating style of story telling rife with arcane and improbable clues and wild goose chases. He doesn't, thankfully, but the results are nonetheless disappointing.Archer still shows signs of being a good story teller in this book, but gone were the excitement, interest, and diabolical twists to which we have become accustomed in his writing. As others have mentioned, plot twists were mostly uininteresting. They were also excruciatingly obvious (except for one, which was simply wrapped up in two ""let's get this over with"" paragraphs near the end. And even that one was predictable early on.And don't get me started about what the author tries to pass off as ""witty dialogue."""
2,A tale that seems uncertain of where it is going.....,"Jeffrey Archer is a great author - ""Kane and Abel"" is wonderful and some of his twisted short stores are amazing. But this book is..... well, seeming lost, and a little short on the thrills and clever turns we've come to expect.The first half of the book relies a little to heavily on the horror of September 11 for me to be comfortable with it, and the latter part of the book is entirely too predictable. It is as if it is two books trying to be one, and in my opinion neither entirely succeeds.This is an easy read of course, and the hero is a sympathetic character. However, the motivations of the bad guys are relatively ill defined, and none of the action ever rings true.Jeffrey Archer has written many much, much better books - go and find them!"
2,How the mighty have fallen,Far below the earlier works by Archer and poorly edited as well. I found one section of the narrative that was out of order chronoligically.Spending time in jail seems to have lessened Archer's skills.
1,"Don't read it, even if you have Robinson Crusoe's fate","This is one story which even a 10 year old can predict the unfolding of. It fails to excite, surprise or thrill even the most avid of Archer fans. After ""An Honour Amongst Thieves"" (which was equally puerile and predicatble) this was the next (and the last) Archer I bought.It seems that in the name of new books, Archer is simply changing the names of characters of his popular titles and torturing us with rehash versions of his bestsellers from 80s - all the stories have exactly the same underlying theme and as we say in India - the same ""masala"". With its car, truck, plane chases, evil lawyer/banker blah blah theme, it could well have been written by some 3rd rate Hindi novelist from Merut. I am sure even Bollywood (now with its new race of directors) would not be interested in buying any story ideas from Archer.Disappointing and kitschy.Don't read it even if you are stranded on an Island, with no company. You can put paper to better use."
2,Will the Real Mr.Archer please stand up?,"Is this really written by THE Jeffrey Archer? Reads like a very poor impersonation of the man who wrote classics like Not a penny more, To cut a long story short, Twelve Red Herrings, etc.Since his trial and jail term, his ability to write has degenerated to amatuerish tales. This book reads like a Hardy Boys Novel...""Search for the Missing Painting""Sorry but Mr.Archer you'll will have to try harder to please your die hard fans!!"
3,Fair At Best,"I was hoping for a little more from Jeffrey Archer after the long layoff. He's written a few of my favorite novels, but I was kind of indifferent to this one. The pacing is a little slow and it never really pulled me in.There's nothing wrong it, but it is definitely not in the same category as K&A; or The Fourth Estate."
1,Nonsense,"Mr Archer would have us believe that one day after the mass attacks on the US homeland, when no one knew what the goodness was going to happen next, the FBI still had a full surveillance team (6? 20? special agents) parked on Anna's apartment. Got steadily worse from then on."
4,For art lovers who like mysteries,"The background is a story in itself where the writer skillfully weaves a great deal of information about Impressionist art and the nuts and bolts of the art world around a solid mystery. The heroine is a modern professional woman with a really authentic feel, (I hate drama queens). The story unwinds as she moves around the world attempting to save herself and everybody else while trying to hold on to a very valuable Van Gogh. It's well done with the story twisting again and again leading to one surprise after another. There is tension and suspense, but the level does not leave you feeling like you've had too much coffee. This is a story that stands on its own but coupled with the everyday business of art it becomes it a real treat."
3,Okay book.,"I have the paperback and on the front cover there is a quote saying' ""A worthy successor to the Da Vinci Code."" So im thinking, 'hey this should be pretty interesting to see how he uses Van Gogh.' The more into the book however, the more I began to notice it is nothing at all like the Da Vinci code, which is fine by me but the book is pretty bland. There is no killer motive behind the crime besides the fact that Fenston, the villain, likes artwork, and there are no real twists that keep you hanging when you put down the book until the morning. In fact, I felt more or less halfway through the book that finishing it is more of a chore. In all it is not a bad book, and there are some pretty intense chapters, but overall does not grab you in my opinion."
1,Holy Crapola,"Maybe its just me, but this has to be one of the worst books I can ever remember finishing. I was actually feeling embarassed for the author as the plot was SO trite and implausible. The obligatory 'round-the-world shuffle for the protagonist with the budding love interest involving half the capital cities in Europe? Awwww...give me a freakin' break!Lame premise in the extreme delivered with too many coincidences and ""exotic"" characters. I was relieved when this clunker was finally finished."
5,Perfect story!,"This is one of the best written books I have ever read. I couldn't put it down! Then, half way through the book I found out that the author lives in the same town that I work while stationed in the UK with my hubby! Which intrigued me even more to know that I could run into him anywhere. Being both to New York and London plus knowing a little background into the other places this book takes you, it is with such accuracy that I was amazed that this was written by only one man. Highly recommended!"
1,Boring,This novel is boring and a waste of time. Don't buy it! You'll have more fun watching grass grow or paint dry.
4,Sit and read,"Albeit the book is very good and you won't be able to close it till you finish, it has some glitches e.g. how can any person cross the busiest Tokyo's street and suddenly goes down and take a grip under a limo and no one the wiser? How Feston knew where Anna was if the killer couldn't call him? Fenston is a fancy art collector and he doesn't know which ear was bandaged in Van Gogh's self portrait? And many more.Of course these ""mistakes"" made the book a fast paced thriller. So watch for the errors and have a good read."
2,"Hook, Line and Stinker.","I think this novel will pull a lot of people in with the 9/11 setting, but it really does not end up feeling like a 9/11 book.The WTC attack is really just used to set up the plot-driving mistaken presumption of death as Anna Petrescu jets around the world toting a Van Gogh and ducking a crew-cutted Eastern bloc assassin.The love story is unoriginal and implausible, the sinister financial scam is ludicrous and the writing is what you might expect.All in all, not a lot to redeem ""False Impression,"" but it'll read fast.JAW"
4,Intriguing foray into the international art world,"Dr. Anna Petrescu worked as an art consultant at Fenston Finance on Wall Street in September 2001. She is dismissed by her boss on September 11th after it is discovered that Anna was advising a client to sell an elusive Van Gogh painting to cover her debts. Her office was in the North Tower. For a time, only her close friend Tina knew she was alive. Anna is determined to reach her client Lady Victoria Wentworth in England before it is too late. Fenston's hired killer and the FBI trail her around the globe. Ingenious and elaborate plotting on Anna's part allows her to save her former client's estate. The novel has many threads that at times seem to go one way and then the other. Nevertheless, it is an enjoyable read."
2,sloppy,"I listened to the audio version of this and hated that the narrator used accents. Not necessary at all, especially since he sometimes used the wrong accent at times!An ordinary character suddenly becomes able to elude monstrous assassins all over the globe? Yeah, right , sure.The story was okay, but there were an awful lot of coincidences in the plotting, and some very ""convenient"" and preposterous plot devices when the author needed them. Some characters make stupid decisions and the formula has been done many times before. Predictable. Poor character development and poor research.If I had had another audio in my car, I would not have finished this."
5,HELEN FORREST'S DEFINITIVE VOCALS!,"Surely one of the greatest female vocalists of the 30's and 40's, Helen Forrest's voice shines in this fantastic collection. A gifted vocalist with a liquid and ethereal voice,Forrest began her career on radio singing under various names when Artie Shaw hired her to sing with his band in early 1938. Forrest then briefly sang for Benny Goodman (a personally unhappy experience) and afterwards joined Harry James in 1941 where her voice was complimented by James' schmaltzy trumpet and fine arrangements. After singing for James, Helen went solo; she died in 1999. Listen to ""Manhattan Serenade"" (with James) ""Time Waits for No One"" and terrific duets with Dick Haymes including ""It Had to Be You"" ""Together"" and ""I'll Buy That Dream""."
3,Warhammer,"This book is the rulebook for the fanatasy game of Warhammer- you collect, assemble, and paint an army of your chosing (things like Elves, Orcs, Goblins, vampires, and knights, among other things) and then partake in battles and campaigns with other players. Very useful if you're interested in actually playing the game, but not light reading- it's a rulebook, not meant for enjoyment."
2,nursing homes from a physical therapist's perspective,"This book is somewhat informative about internal pressures in nursing homes and how they work. For instance, she relates how a physical therapist may be pressured to let less qualified people actually do the work and sign off on it.But her perspective is pretty exclusively that of a physical therapist and of old people whose conditions CAN improve. This is not everyone and the geriatric nurse perspective she criticizes is actually more humane for many people.She has some good suggestions on things to look at, people to talk to, and questions to ask of a nursing home, but if you are going to get only one book on the topic, this would not be it."
4,a diamond in the rough,"As far as I know, Akbar hasn't done anything since. But if you're a fan of NYC conscious hip-hop, seek this out. Awesome production, awesome rhymes. Great album."
3,"Where's ""Go To Hell""?","I own every Megadeth album and whilst ""Capitol Punishment"" is reasonable, a few selections/omissions are regrettable. The ""hidden"" medley track is a waste, where were any of the tracks from ""Hidden Treasures""? It staggers me that ""Go To Hell"" is not on this ""best of"". ""Kill The King"" & ""Dread & The Fugitive Mind"" are decent enough, but instead of tracks 3 - 5 they should have had ""Architecture Of Aggression"", ""Angry Again"" & perhaps ""No More Mr. Nice Guy"", and instead of the hidden track ""Go To Hell"". Whilst a reasonable introduction to the band for the beginner, the longer-term fan may quibble with a couple of tracks."
4,THE PUNISHMENT DUE!!,"This is a great mix of music from Peace Sell...TO...Risk.I've been a fan since 1986.I also have seen them live in concert.As far as this album I would say this one is the best ""BEST OF"" fromMEGADETH!!I rate this CD a 4 of 5 stars!!"
2,Doesn't cut it,Now this is a greatest of CD that would get 5 stars:1. Blackmail The Universe3. 1000 Times Goodbye4. Prince Of Darkness5. She-Wolf(extended)6. Train Of Consequences7. Symphony Of Destruction(extended)8. Hangar 189. Five Magics9. Set The World Afire10. Peace Sells11. Devils Island12. Looking Down The Cross13. These Boots(uncensored)14. Go To Hell
2,Disappointed...,"At first the case seemed like a good idea, but after the third use the zipper stopped working. Because the case does not stay open on its own, there is a tendency to push the case open and force the zipper backward and apart. After fixing it a couple of times, it is now permanently broken. Bad design. Perhaps Velcro would have been better here."
2,This thing is HUGE.,This is designed for a class set of Leap Pads-- not for home storage or travel. It is absolutely enormous. You could store 12 Leap Pads and a laptop in this.
4,Very Convenient,"I bought this for my 4-year old son. He has a leap pad and many of the books. This is very convenient for me as it holds all his books and the leap pad itself. It keeps everything organized and in one place. It is big and somewhat awkward for him to carry, but it works wonderfully to keep everything together so nothing gets lost or misplaced."
3,Need space for more learning systems,"This case is OK for holding the LeapPad learning system, books and cartridges, but it does not stay open by itself, and my not-quite 4 year old son can't hold both sides down to keep it open. We used it with his My First LeapPad, as well, and the spine has not softened up with age as we had hoped. He also has a PowerTouch and a Leapster, and I would be interested to know if anyone has found a solution to storing multiple leaning systems in one case. We spend a lot of weekends traveling to grandparent's house, and it would be nice to have one tote for all of the systems. We currently store the Leapster in an old cassette tape case, and the PowerTouch is in an old diaper bag."
3,leap pad orgnaizer,Its really nice because it holds 12 books and the leap pad itself. They could do better on the colors.
2,Great Accessorie,I'm so glad I found this! My 4 year old son has a Leap Pad and we desperately needed a way to keep the Leap Pad and books & cartridges away from his little brothers and sister. This is PERFECT! What a great idea! And this is the only place I found it.
1,"A good idea, but poor quality","I purchased this in May 2006. I was so happy to have an organized way to store the leappad, books and cartridges. I was happy until August 2006 when the zipper broke. I've tried fixing it a few times, but it keeps breaking. It's useless without the zipper because everything just falls out. Not worth the money or my time trying to repair it."
3,doesnt hold enough,Its a nice case if u only have a few books but over a few and the books fall out and unless u are next to ur child they can not put the tape with the book.
3,Great item for organizational purposes!,"Our 4 year old son received this item for Christmas and it has proven to be a great item to help him stay organized. Until now, his Leap Pad, books, and cartridges could be found (or not!) in any corner of our house. Now he has a place to store everything that he needs to effectively use his Leap Pad. We've found that he plays with it more often because he knows where everything is and doesn't have to go on a mad search for a particular book and its matching cartridge. There is a large pocket for the Leap Pad itself, medium sized pockets for the books and small mesh pockets for the cartridges. All easily accessible to little hands. This is a GREAT compliment to the Leap Pad and its accessories and it's never too early to begin teaching the art of organization to a child!"
3,great for an older leap pad user,"I thought this product was great when I first purchased it. What a wonderful way to keep little toys organized and together. We no longer spend 20 minutes looking for the little cartridges that allow my son's leap frog to play. I have found two major problems with this system. My son is 5, and loves his leap pad, but he can't get the leap pad in and out of the pocket that is designed to hold it. We have resorted to just shoving it into the zip pouch and it unfailingly falls on the floor while he tries to get it out. My son also has about 6 cartridges and books which are in the organizer with the leap pad. The combination of the weight is too much for him to carry and I always end up carrying it for him. An adjustable shoulder strap would have been SOOOOO much better! It frustrates us both!"
1,Zipper broke!!,"I wanted the backpack, but none in stock. I bought this item, and after a few weeks of less than normal wear and tear, the zipper broke. Leap Pad customer service wouldn't help, said I was the first to complain of a quality problem. What an inconvenience and a big, big disappointment. Good concept, but watch out! Think twice before buying this bag."
4,More space,"The organizer only has room for 12 books/cartridges. My 4 yr old has 20, so I put two books to a pocket. I store one right side up and the other one upside down to keep the spiral binders from tangling. The down side to this is sometimes the corners of the books curl up but does not disrupt operation of the system.My storage options now is to buy another organizer, store the extra books/cartridges in a large rubbermaid container, or store them in large ziplock bags with cartridges."
1,A must for all pixter owners!,This is definitly a good thing to have handy while toting your pixter. Mine is under heavy useage and goes everywhere with me. And now that I have five cartridges I needed it. It is very durable and protective. The only downside is that it only holds three cartridges. (one loaded in the pixter and two in the side compartment.) I have five and find it difficult to fit them all. I usaually put the extras behind the pixter. But other than that it is something to consider having as the pixter is not totally durable on it's own. The case serves as a protector against oops!
3,"Sturdy, but not roomy.","My daughter has this case for her Pixter. It is sturdy and protects the Pixter well. Two drawbacks, however. First, it only hold three Pixter cartridges (two in the space available and one in the game). Second, it only has a clip to hold it. I think some kind of handle would be more practical, as you wouldn't be likely to clip it to something, but it would be easier to tote along with handles. Sometimes my daughter uses a small bag or backpack to carry it instead, giving her more room for cartridges and other items and leaving her hands free."
1,PROBLEM,Doesn't mention anywhere in the ad that it's for a b&w pixter only. Looks like they will be getting lots of returns.
3,This could be shortened by a lot,"This novel is only worth 3 stars because of its lengthy descriptions of war, which extends to almost two-thirds of the 530 over pages. If it could be shortened and the pen put to good use, i.e. substituting the descriptions of war with issues to do with romance with Pelagia or Corelli as the protagonist, like the way you'll see in Love in the Time of Cholera by Gabriel Garcia Marquez, then this book definitely worth 5-stars. After all, I feel the main theme here is romance, and in a book, or in any piece of literature or artwork, there should only be one main theme. Therefore, I perceive that the lengthy descriptions of war before Corelli met Pelagia, which at the same time has no relation to the romantic wait by Corelli, is just a deliberate flaunting of the author's knowledge of the war."
3,worth reading,"O.K. if you've seen the film it's woth reading, but if you haven't seen the film you may find it hard going. Stick with though once you've started it does get better."
2,DISTURBING,"I purchased this dvd without knowing what it was about. After viewing it, I thought it was more disturbing than scarey. But disturbing is thought provoking and, therefore, a good thing. It is a ghost story involving EVP and dark spirits.The only thing I really did not like about White Noise was the ending. I hate it when dark spirits win."
4,Keaton is back!,"I love Michael Keaton and he was great in this movie. The story is creepyand at times a bit far fetched, but Keaton keeps it very believable.Really liked it!"
2,decent story line...what happened?,"decent storyline but it falls short, especially the ending. This is not a terrible movie but I expected more. A little better than most of the recent Hollywood crap horror movies."
2,Boring Bunch of Static,"This is one of those annoying films that is just interesting enough to keep you watching to find out what happens without every actually being engaging. Michael Keaton spends a lot of time watching static on a TV set and listening to static on a tape recorder. Occasionally the static tells him something and he gets all excited and runs out and does something. then he comes back and watches the static again. If you want to watch a good horror movie, then look at The Others or What Lies Beneath. If you want to watch a bunch of static on a screen, then watch this."
2,Lost the plot,"I watched this film after having recorded it from the TV. I thought it might be just about hold my attention, apart from the ridiculous idea of the phantom cameraman. I kept with it until all of a sudden, it was coming to an end and I realised that I didn't have the faintest idea what was supposed to have happened. I watched the last ten minutes two more times and I'm still none the wiser."
1,"Weak plot, weak cast: complete waste of time","The story line doesn't progress in this movie. It simply jerks around to various 'shocking' items that you constantly expect to be put together later on. It never happens. Some characters seem to have no purpose. In fact, the end isn't predictable because it really doesn't make sense.Aside from the movie itself, the features on the DVD that recommend you try this kind of thing at home bothers me. Is this a self-help DVD? An occult or witchcraft recommendation? At best, a person could become obsessed with listening to white noise on the radio.Zero entertainment value. Odd 'features' that feel like something from late night television. Any other DVD you find is likely better than this."
2,Another Wannabe Ring,"And even the Ring was not that great. White noise is about a man who after his wife dies tragically gets obsessed with this phenomenon where the dead can communicate with the living via static on TV and Radio. As he gets deeper and deeper into it he slowly gets drawn into it's world where some are trying to help him, and others are trying to kill him.The movie itself is very slow and dragging which hurts it as well. The ghosts that try to kill him really don't show up until the last 30 minutes and the thrills are just not there. This wannabe Horror film suffers from a lack of everything. Sadly another case of a sacry movie, that isn't scary."
3,MAKES ONE THUINK,THIS WAS A MOVIE THAT HELD YOUR INTEREST AND MADE YOU THINK ABOUT ALL THE ELECTRONICS THAT YOU HAVE IN YOUR HOUSE. A NEW AGE FRIGHT!
1,Sweet Jesus in heaven...,"what dreck! A total insult to the intelligence, but why is that surprising? Yet another big fat loser of a horror film in a sea of pretenders. Horror films these days are so puddle deep that the formula is to throw a bunch of mysterious, quasi-creepy stuff at the audience and then try to tie all of it together in 10 minutes, which they never do. The director obviously knows the standard tricks of scare, which was the only thing to be pleased by. For example, they had a mirror/medicine cabinet opening scene and made you brace up for the chill and then nothing happened, so that was cool. But ain't nothing else to see here. EVP is a promising concept for a film, but they managed to jack it up anyway. Avoid, avoid, avoid."
2,Disappointing.......,"Although rated PG-13, I decided to rent this movie because it was about the paranormal. Michael Keaton gives a good performance in this movie however, it doesn't make up for a boring movie. After losing his wife, he's obsessed with trying to reach her beyond the grave and uses a new technology called EVP to try to communicate with her. We hear messages left on his answering machine and alot of static in this movie, making it boring after a while. This is not a spooky movie by any means. I was glad when it was finished. I don't recommend this movie for people who like alot of suspense or thrills!"
2,The Voice From the Grave,"I have always been a fan of Michael Keaton. His acting is of such superior quality that as one watches him ply his trade, it's nearly magical. His specialty is that regardless of role, he proves believable and convincing. Such is the case with his new film, White Noise. In this role, he plays Jonathan Rivers, a happily married and successful architect, who after losing his wife is visited by those who study EVP or Electronic Voice Phenomena. Seeking some way to communicate with his deceased wife, he struggles to understand and accept the premises that the living can indeed communicate with the dead. The film, like the script is palatable enough, but hardly worthy of Keaton's superior talent. One actor in the film who does enter a surprising performance is Raymond Price who plays Ian McNeice. However, the film itself falls short of conviction and therefore regulated to mediocrity. **"
2,Expected so much more...,"As previous reviewers mentioned, the script has so many holes as to make this film somewhat incoherent. I have been waiting to see the terrific Michael Keaton again, and this just didn't do it for me. Aside from the fact that the plot is way over the top of believability, the wonderful production values and eerie mood can't save it. I'm disappointed that I bought the film sight unseen. I expected better; the trailers/previews are the best thing about it. The DVD extras are plentiful, but it's still a crashing bore."
1,White Noise,"Horribly bad movie. It's About dead people who communicate through 'evp' voice recognition. Michael Keaton plays a man who lost his wife and encounters an evp guy who thinks his wife is trying to communicate with him through the phone. the tv, etc.He starts getting premonitions of people who are about to be murdered. The ending made no sense whatsoever and had these corny looking computurized demons coming down from the sky. If You actually beleive in this stuff you may like it but it's just silly bs to me."
3,Not thrilled,Great effects but White noise was a disappointment because they are not discribing what white noise REALLY is. They really pushed the envelope on this. Suspension of disbelief takes a back seat when true fact is distorted. though Michael Keaton as usual..is excellent.
1,?!?!!?,"I'll keep this one short, as usual, in this case because I'm guessing about 1 or 2 people visit this page per month. I saw the preview to White Noise, thinking it looked promising. I saw it the second day in theaters, with maybe 5 other people also watching. I've walked out of theaters during the credits disappointed before. I've walked out content before. But never before had I been so apathetic to what had happened on the screen. White noise flirts with the concept of electronic signals picking up messages from ""the other side,"" which sounded as if it could be genuinely chilling. But no... It was a convoluted, self-involved Scooby Doo mystery that decided it wasn't going to stay on the same page as the viewer from the start. The scares were all telegraphed shruggers, and the CGI battle with ghosts at the end was just intolerable.So yeah... Don't watch it.- Thus says the Pellington"
2,Could have been great,"I went to see this movie on the second day it was released and the theatre had only a couple people that alone says something. I think with this plot they could have made an excellent movie, however I thought this one was terrible. The story was weird and at times boring and Michael Keaton was fine, but the other actors were terrible..at times you wonder wether they actually cared,they talked in the same bored tone and you find yourself wondering when is this movie going to be over. If your looking for a good freaky movie rent the 6th sense or something along those lines. I would not recommend seeing this it would just be a waste of money."
2,Oh dear!,This film starts off with some genuinely chilling effects but by the end leaves you wondering how it ever got produced. The ending is completely cliched and it is very difficult not to laugh as the credits roll. One worth missing.
2,If you like static.....,"you'll like White Noise. The preview made it look scary and good, but in reality it's a lame pseudo scary movie that wouldnt scare a baby. A stupid logic doesnt help this turkey."
1,Just plain boring,"I loved the concept of this film and was really looking forward to seeing it. Once I put it on, however, I kept waiting and waiting for something interesting to happen. The great concept is set up and then ... zzzzzzzzz. I mean, is it really entertaining to watch somebody else watching TV ad infinitum with nothing but a snowy picture and staticky voices. I stuck with it hoping for a better payoff and when it came, I was extremely disappointed. Ghosts and spirits run amok looking the the outakes from the end of Ghost. I can't reccommed this one if you are looking for a thriller.Oh, Micheal Keaton: What's with hair?"
2,good till the end,"This movie suffers the same as many other scary movies, that it is pretty good until the end. The ending does not make sense, and the entire scariness falls apart. Not a bad movie to rent, but definitely not worth buying."
3,Drawn Out Suspense with Low Climax,"The director did an excellent job of making you want to stay tuned for more. There was a lot of suspense and a lot of unanswered questions that made this movie impossible to turn off. The acting is also prety good -- I've always enjoyed Michael Keaton.Unfortunately, you reach the end of the movie and you think, ""That's it?""If you get a kick out of suspense then check this out. The story is okay but the ending could have been more satisfying."
2,Garbled noise is more like it.,"I don't want to totally trash the movie. Maybe there was just something I missed. The movie theater was loud that day. A kid was screaming his head off and I lost two scenes in the process but from what I saw I didn't understand. Plus, there were a lot of slow parts. Also, I don't think michael keaton should have believed in that his wife was comunicating through static that quickly. Also, at the end, there was a total of two minutes in one scene where it's just a bunch of never ending screaming. The ending was also confusing. I hope they don't make a sequel to this. It was scary, I have to give it that. But I wanted more plot."

1,"It's just STUPIDITY, it makes no sense !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","This movie keeps you guessing ""what will happen next?"", only to be dissappointed about what does happen. The end of the movie was SO DAMN ............................................... let's not even go there!- Anyway, don't buy this movie.(I would rather watch Barney)"
4,THE NOISE KEEPS YOUR ATTENTION!,"Wow, this movie was pretty freaky. About a man who loses his wife when he find out she died. But strangly finds out that he can interact with the dead. So he does and realized he can see deaths happen before they actually do. But fate isn't always so kind to those that are good. Evil ghosts that are in a group of three try to stop him by letting out he secret of how his wife really die and who is killing all the people that he connects with.This movie is probably one of the scariest movies I have seen in the past couple of years. So for all those people who like horror, this is a good one."
2,White Noise is not the least bit a disturbing thriller as it is said to be,"White Nose can be summed up in one word...awful! From the opening scene to the closing scene, it just makes no sense. This movie is one of the worst i have ever seen. Thank god for the cast because they made it so i didn't turn off the television in the middle of the movie. Michael Keaton does an excellent acting job, and the concept of the movie is awesome, but the effects are awful, the movie was rather confusing to me and i especially didn't like the way it ended since it didn't explain anything. Also very slow at times, sort of dragging on...not very touching or scary in the least bit, i would not recommend this flim to anyone!!"
4,White Noise,"I recently saw this movie, although, it is not an intensely horrific movie..I am a HUGE fan of Michael Keaton and if it were not for him acting in this movie, I definitely would have made a huge pass on the movie.....It was not a bad movie, maybe a little far fetched...but who knows...maybe there is something to be said about this EVP stuff."
3,what is the name of the theme song throughout the movie,does anyone know the name of who sings the theme song throughoutt he movie there are no vocals but it plays at the end of the burial and other parts of the movie....if anyone knows the name plz im me at prfcteclipse99 or email me at bsiegrist33@yahoo.com
1,WOW could it of been any worse?,"Well let me see. When i asked two of my friends about this movie they said it was absolutely terrible, however when my friends and i found ourselves out at 12 am we thought might as well see it, it cant be that bad. Well it turns out we were dreadfully wrong! This movie was a let down to the max. It made little to no sense, the plot was miserable...""Go now""....yea go see a real movie now! Do not waste $9.50 watching this terrible flick, and definatly do not go rent it when its out on video, b/c i can garuntee it will be just as bad at home..."
2,Super quick review of White Noise,"I didn't like this very much.It was a bad mix of Final Destination, Ring, and Mothman PropheciesGood idea, but with no good movie"
5,THE BEST HORROR FILM EVER!!!,This movie is super scary and so cool. I love this movie I bought it and every time it is a rainy day i watch it all the time. Buy this movie and you won't be sorry.
1,HOLY S***!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I expected this movie to be fun, scary, and really good! But what did I get? A stupid, boring, dumb-a** movie! (Sorry about all the cussing....) I saw the preview and it looked so good! But it was the dumbest movie in the world!!!!!!!!!! I HATE THIS MOVIE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,great movie for any1 curious about paranormalities,"i actually enjoyed this movie allot, it showed facts of paranormal activities with an added and some-what believable storyline. great sci-fi thriller..."
2,Completely different from the first movie,My wife watched it and said it was more about the occult and it gave her nightmares. She said she shouldn't have watched it and that it didn't relate to the first movie at all.
2,No Thanks.,"I fell asleep during this movie. It was a good nap too. I guess it's unfair to judge this since I didn't actually watch the whole thing, but what I did see was really boring and unconvincing."
3,[insert static],"This flick is 1 hour and 38 minutes long. When it gets to 1:28, just turn it off. The premise is great, the setup is strong, and then it falls completely apart in the last 10 min. It's a really big let down, and total lack of thread to tie events together. I'm fine with mystery and loose ends, but the plot resolution attempts to indicate an association without telling you why you should care. Not an intuitive leap at all.Makes me sad cos it really was going along so well."
2,A great premise with a poor execution,"""White Noise"" has a great premise, competent acting and directing, and some mildly spooky moments. But that's all. The script is a mess, with a very frustrating lack of focus. In fact, while I was watching this film, I couldn't help but ask myself ""Were the filmmakers making up the story as they went along?"" Not to mention the fact that ""electronic voice phenomenon"" was used purely as a gimmick in this film. There are some slightly creepy moments to be found here and there, but they pop up about as often as a dead person's voice on a de-tuned radio."
4,White Noise is an entertaining movie that falls a bit short,"I saw White Noise this past weekend and I thought it was entertaining. I thought this movie was better than The Grudge and the suspense kept me interested in the movie almost the entire time. What really caught my attention about this movie was when I saw the commercial mentioning Ruth Baxter and how the dead can communicate with us through EVP (Electrical Voice Phenomenon). Sadly to say the commercial was misleading since this movie did not go very far in to the EVP pheomomenon. White Noise got bad reviews from many critics but despite the negativity it did a great job the first weekend of its release opening in a very immpresive #2 with 24 Million dollars. To me this movie was entertaining and not half as bad as what the critics would expect you to believe. This is only rated PG-13 so it is not going to be as scary as you might think, but it is a good movie that is worth watching."
3,"Mommy, do you see the people in the t.v.?","To start off: I don't like horror movies, so that my cloud my thinking in whether or not this was a good movie, but I thought the plot was lame. Yes, it was scary, no doubt about that. (Think about it...How would you like people screaming at you through your television, and no, it's not an infomercial?) So the story starts off as usual. Guy's wife dies mysteriously, guy tries to go on with life when stranger confronts him and tells him he can speak to his wife. Guy then becomes obsessed. BLah blah blah, you know the rest. However, the scary moments in White Noise were scary. The noises were kinda annoying, but it was scary. I will so not deny that. So it sums up to this: If you like horror movies that have no plot whatsoever but provide the freaky factor, get this movie. Otherwise, move to a different movie."
3,Mr. Mom Is Back,"Its good to see Michael Keaton back in a film after what seems like quite a long hiatus. He's always had some indescribable charisma and he puts it to good use here in 'White Noise'. The film itself is based on an interesting, but obscure, real life subject: electronic voice phenomena.The movie unfortunately doesn't really do anything with its fairly original premise. Its fairly by-the-numbers with no major surprises. But the thing thats stands out in the film is the four or five times that you are literally chilled to the bone. Some scenes are truly terrifying. Too bad the rest of the film wasn't as well done as these bits were creepy.All in all, 'White Noise' isn't a bad film, but its not great either. What it is though is a good film to reintroduce Michael Keaton back in to leading man status. And those few creepy moments that I'm still thinking about..."
2,Interesting story but...,"I was looking forward to watching this movie. About 90% of the movie is a decent story with the right amount of character development and the plot keeps moving at a fair pace. However, the moment the ending hits the movie is by most accounts ruined. The ending is rushed and poorly done. It just makes no sense why they chose to do what they did... all in all an ok movie, but don't expect anything special fromt he ending or you will be disappointed."
2,Needs Full Frontal Nudity,"The only thing that could have saved this film is full frontal nudity. Hell, I don't care if it's Michael Keaton or the blonde chick. Either way, nudity would have earned it another star.The film is hardly about EVP. It's about a guy whose dead wife is sending him messages through the static on his TV screen. Amazingly, you can see people's faces and bodies crystal clear within the static. One minute you're staring at snow and the next minute, you can see the clothes that a ghost from beyond is wearing. She shows him something bad that is ABOUT to happen to someone in the community and he tries to stop it before it happens. In this way, it's a lot like the Sixth Sense only not good. There is no back story in the beginning that allows you to get to know the characters and the ending is confusing and unsatisfying. Rent it in case you ever play a board game involving trivia about bad movies."
3,Very uneven but interesting,"I was surprised when I got this, thinking that I would hate it. Instead, it was a decent thriller about EVP. My complaints would be about the plot-nothing is ever explained as to why some of the dead reaching out to the living are evil, and actually threatened living people.It was very scarey, and I still have nightmares about it."
4,Entertaining Enough,"While there are many negative reviews for White Noise, I found the movie to be entertaining and worth the watch. The acting was good, and the ending unsuspected. The plot was unique, and in the world of modern cookie-cutter Hollywood that makes it worth watching alone."
3,Overall pretty good,"I thought White Noise has a great & different concept compared to the usual ""Thiller"" movies out there. If you let yourself get sucked into the movie there are those moments that you have goose bumps and your heart pounds.Keaton does a great job in the role where he the only real star.I felt the ending really failed the movie and that is why I give it 3 stars instead of 4."
3,It stands up for at least one viewing,The movie WHITE NOISE is entertaining enough to watch once at night when these sort of movies are worth watching. I liked where the movie was going at first. Showing us E.V.P and the people who deal with it but then the movie just turned into the standard affair. I'm very dissapointed in this movie. After the promising start this movie was just ruined but it still merits at least one watch out of the consumer. Only one because after the second one you notice the many plot holes and contrivances.
2,white noise (1.5 stars),"this movie starts out good but just ends weird. there is hardly any exciting parts in the movie and it`s just boring all around. I don`t advise you buy this, just rent it. there`s just not enough happening in this for me to give it more then 1.5 stars. what ever happened to the days when horror movies were scary?!"
1,umm....,"There's no explanation, no plot, no climax. It sucks that the guy dies at the end but it doesnt explain what is going on and why things happened the way they did. I would not recommend this movie even when it comes out on video and I am very upset at myself for paying $8 to see it."
1,Zzzzzz Noise,"That noise you hear isnt white noise. It's that terrible zzzzzz noise from sleeping movie watchers who couldn't keep their eyes open. This is another attempt to bring ""maturity"" and ""artistry"" to the fantasy/horror genre but it fails miserably. It's impossible to feel any fright or tension from the tepid screenplay. Michael Keaton is shown in endless scenes as he tries to communicate with his dead wife. You watch him staring bug-eyed at the monitor filled with static. And then somehow, he's convinced he's made contact with his wife in the great beyond. Oh, yeah, he does have a son, but you wonder how the kid survives because he rarely sees his father. There appears to be a genuine psychic phenomena known as 'white noise'--where voices from dead people have been received via monitors. If so, then this movie needs to be remade with a much better script and a lot more genuine scares than this mess conjured up."
5,Scariest Movie Ever!!!!,this is such a scary and great horrific film. I loved this movie so bad I bought it the first day it came out. But first i saw it in theaters I walked in with a large popcorn. Then I sat down the movie started it started off really good. Then a real scary part appered on the screen then some girls in the theater started screaming then they screamed the rest of the movie. it got on my nerves but I don't blame them it was a very scary part so buy this movie if you like scary movies. If you love scary movies then you'll love this movie!!!!!!
5,A Great Horror Film!!,This movie is a very great movie. If someone thinks it's not scary then they don't know scary. This movie has a lot of creepy scenes and a lot of parts that make you want to scream. So buy this movie and you'll love it.
3,I was a little disappointed,"Without giving away the story, I was a little disappointed with this movie. In theory, it sounded very intriguing, but I felt like it fell short of being the terrifying movie it could have been."
4,Prepared to be SCARED! White Noise delivers the goods.,"I literally jumped out of my seat a few times while watching this movie. Michael Keaton does a decent job as the husband of a famous author who goes missing and is later found dead. She attempts to contact him from beyond, but we require the assistance of a EVP specialist to help establish that contact. That's where all hell breaks loose, literally.Keaton starts monitoring his own bank of TVs and radios to capture spirit communications. He finds that the spirits are warning him of things to come, but there is more. He finds the truth behind his wife's death, and even more than he bargained for.Great effects, great story, good acting, and enough scares to spook you out the rest of the night. Make sure you watch this with the lights off."
1,I can do better,Mostly food stuff...things i have already done...and disappointingly...I do more than what they have suggested for my man! NOT worth my money!
3,Too many unexplained leaps,"I think this could have been a very good book, except the main character made too many leaps of thought that for me were impossible to follow. She would essentially start a line of reasoning, get part way through it, and then suddenly a series of actions would be taken based on that, but to me it was unclear how she'd gotten to the decisions she reached. I found myself re-reading numerous parts just to try to understand her line of reasoning, but I seldom did. Having said that, I think this author has potential but I think I'll wait until she gets her writing style a little more developed."
4,"An engrossing, but slightly convoluted read!","CJ Songer's Bait is an excellent book. Finally a female protagonist that is intelligent, unpredictable, and very courageous. Meg is calm and collected in the face of the intrique that surrounds her. What I enjoyed most was that she wasn't the typical shrinking violet heroine that ends up relying on a man or men to fix everything, she's well equipped to do that job herself. C.J. Songer has created a new a very fresh female character that is very 90's and will definitely wear well into the next century."
5,Definitely Hooked,"I bought Bait and Hook based on reader reviews and am glad I bought both at the same time because I didn't have to race out and buy the second. I did have to go back and re-read once in awhile to catch on to what Meg was saying or doing. Does it detract from the books? No. You (and the other characters) think Meg is going to do one thing by her actions, but she usually manages to surprise both. Meg's relationships with her partner Mike and the investigating cop Reilly are believable and add a great deal to the story. My only disappointment is learning from C.J.'s website that we have to wait until Fall of 2003 for the next in the series."
4,Rapid interpretations of Ventilator Waveforms,"A must for the general internist seeking a better understanding of mechanical ventilation or anyone new to the critical care field. This along, with ""Guide to Mechanical Ventilation and Intensive Respiratory Care"" by Pierce, is a great, and painless, way to get started."
2,Not all that reliable,I own two of these and one is down now needing repair. The other one was already repaired last summer. Both have had the same problem. This model has a slotted drive belt rather than direct drive. In each case the drive belt has worn out long before I feel like it should have. I use these for trimming wood edgebanding tape on curved panels. They run for about 45 seconds to a minute at a time and then get a rest for 10 or so minutes before being used again. It is rare when both are being used at one time. And most times they are used heavily for a week or so then placed on the shelf again for a month or more before being used again. I have had no issues with the height adjustment.Porter-Cable 7312 Offset Base Laminate Trimmer
5,"Fun, Cute Story","The Cardcaptor Sakura story continues. My students love this book and they are dying for each book I bring in. At least the girls are, the boys are into Naruto and Bleach. The girls oooh and ahhh! over every turn and just love this story. It gets them reading without my ever having to say anything!"
5,Fantastic story with a lot of Japanese cultural information,"My daughter absolutely loves Cardcaptor Sakura! Well written fantasy story with a lot of Asian mythology. Also, great resource for Japanese culture.We watched all DVD after we finished reading books. There are American version with character's names are transformed into English names...but I strongly recommend to read Authentic versions. It's too odd to see all Japanese characters have English names..."
3,Helpful ideas for beginning ESL writing teachers,"Even though this book is a bit old, it still can be useful for new teachers. In it, you'll find very specific ideas on how to use materials (such as pictures, readings, etc), and how to incorporate controlled writing and teacher response into student writing."
5,Don't wait another second if you found your way here. Buy it,"This is an anthology of The band known as Corduroy. As far as I'm concerned, these guys play Funkified Acid Jazz that is consistently spectacular when lead vocals are absent. The first disc though is free of the sometimes intrusive lead vocals, allowing Corduroy's amazing musicianship shine through. All twenty tracks of the first disc include cuts from their albums High Havoc and Dad Man Cat. I think there's another album as well. Certainly worth the purchase for Disc I alone of the anthology. If you like these guys- check out the James Taylor Quartet Too. Alllllright."
1,Porter Cable 556 Plate Joiner,"This was my introduction to biscuit joining and I bought this when other plate joiners were way more expensive. However, it was a disappointment and left me feeling there must be a better way. My 556 had a strong tendency to walk sideways as the blade entered the wood. This left the slots too wide and in some cases exposed the ends of the slot when cutting in 2 in. wide stock. I eventually bought the DeWalt model after trying it at a woodworking show and seeing how a plate joiner SHOULD work....pass it up and get the DeWalt."
3,Accurate but lacks power,"Tool seems to lack power and struggles at times. Most of my slots have been in relativity soft white pine which makes the lack of power even more troubling. It does cut accurate slots, but you have to take your time. It is fully adjustable with Allen wrenches. It is not in the same class as my other Porter-Cable tools. If you plan on cutting a ton of slots you may be able to justify one of the more expensive plate joiners."
2,Misleading Information,"This is listed as a yr 2000 CD which is presumably the year it was issued. The accompanying notes state that it was recorded in 1960. Furthermore it was recorded at a live performance. The technical quality reflects both the age and the limitations of recording a live performance.Although the fervour of the live performance comes through perhaps it was not one of the best.If there are technical reasons why the 7th track on disk 2 is from some completely different recording, this should have been stated by the producers of the CD in the prepurchase notes so that one knew about it before purchasing, or did they just get them mixed up?All in all I would have chosen a different recording if I had known the true facts."
4,Waste of money,"My son loves Buzz (3 yo). He was so excited to get this toy. But, I am putting the wings back on all of the time. He is big and bulky and hard for my son to carry. His back pack never stays on, you snap in place and it pops right back off. My son lost the rockets with in five minutes and his voice works when it wants to. Waste of money for me, but since it is Buzz my son loves it."
4,Very disappointed,"My son loves this toy, mainly because he loves anything from Toy Story. As his mother though, I am very disappointed with this purchase. As many other reviews have stated, it's wings and back plate fall off easy. And only one week after my son got this toy for Christmas the voice and gun sounds don't work(he does not play rough with Buzz, nor has he dropped him). I bought the Woody that is supposed to interact with Buzz and now can not use it since the Buzz no longer works. At least my three year old doesn't know and care about how much money was wasted."
3,Not Really the Guardians Anymore,"While still witty and entertaining, this installment fails to capture the spirit and flavor of the original three. Gone is the wonder of people from a mundane, technological world trapped in a world of dragons, miracles, and arcane magic. Also, gone is the righteousness of Karl Cullinane & Crew's original goals.Not only have these elements been completely left out in favor of a plot involving the characters in a convoluted political morass, Rosenberg has left several loose ends untied.For instance, what happened with the conflict with the wizard that originally brought them to this place? And the sword destined for Jason Cullinane?.Maybe it's been so long since the original trilogy, even the author has forgotten what was happening."
2,Not Quite What I Had In Mind,"For many years Mr. Rosenberg has entertained his readers with fantastic adventure and delights from his mythic land. Anyone who has ever ""thrown some dice"" from the comfort of their den or basement was instantly and (like me) permanently drawn into the idea of awakening in the ""game realm."" I loved the earliest works for this very detail. However, as the series progressed, the plot line (which originally drew me so close) regressed into an average fantasy tale. By this book publication, I hardly recognize the thrill from the original four (or so) books. Mr. Rosenberg has within him the creative fire to return his characters (and us, the audience) to the world we first met in ""The Sleeping Dragon;"" but it is completely up to him to rejuvinate the characters and myriad plot-lines to their once captivating and imaginative status. In short, bring restore the ""guardians"" to their original and best task, the task we all long to see and do - adventuring!Sincerely,Marc Harmon"
5,A great read,"In Not Quite Scaramouche, Kethol, Pirojil, and the mildly competent and untrustworthy wizard, Erenor, are charged first with bodyguarding characters that readers of previous Guardians of the Flame books will remember fondly, and new readers will surely enjoy. Naturally, things don't go as planned as our heroes end up having to flee into the countryside to attempt to recover a missing heir. This is a great read and very entertaining.Another GREAT READ !! The Price of Immortality by C.M. Whitlock"
5,Excellent flashlight,"A flashlight is usually just a flashlight, but when it can make use of batteries that you have for other tools and that can always be kept charged, it becomes something more. It becomes more useful and used more. I no longer even think to look for any of my other flashlights when I need one as the Dewalt is always at the ready, is stronger, brighter and more comfortable in my hand than any other that I have ever used. If you already have tools that use this battery, don't even hesitate to add the Dewalt 14.4 cordless to your tool collection. It is powerful and versatile."
2,Very Bright But...,"Got mine in a combo pack. Light is durable and bright but after a year of use, it will not turn on with the switch. I have to turn the switch on and then give the battery a good whack to get it to go on."
3,Lousy fence,I'm a home DIYer and bought this for fitting new solid pine doors into the existing jambs. It takes time to get the hang of it and avoid leaving a wavey surface when going across the whole door. The adjustable beveling fence on this planer is cheap and does not offer any support nor accuracy. Forming a 3degree bevel on the door is near impossible (I had to cut a jig with a piece of 2x4 screwed to the fence); in fact the fence will not set to 90degrees. Look at the Bosch or if you can spend the extra $250 for the PC 9118.
4,Another fine Porter-Cable product,"I am a big DeWalt fan, but I must say that I have been most pleased with the last few Porter-Cable products I have purchased. The planer is no different, a very well made product indeed! It should be noted by the buyer that this particular P/C product is made in Italy."
3,Menos Rather Than Mas,"I am a lover of Cuban music. I am a second generation Cubano who is very assimilated. Buena Vista Social Club, Blanco y Negro and No Borders Canto are three concert DVDs that have resonated strongly with me. Sad to say, the music is great on this DVD but, for me, there is no emotional connection between the music, the performers and this viewer. Sorry! I was disappointed. Video and sound were satisfactory."
5,The Pleasure of His Company,"This book is wonderful, it lets you see Jesus in a whole new light, when the care's of this world start to get to you, this book is a must read, it truly takes you into the Pleasure of His Company."
4,Good reference for any location,"While there is information in this collection of articles that is specific to Oregon viticulture, there is also a good bit of information that is useful for any viticultural area. The sections on financial planning, site preparation, trellising, and labor were very useful. The diagrams on climate for Oregon are easy to read and done in color with a nice glossy finish. There is a good section on organic methods, but it mostly deals with certification, and not with actual organic methods. Oregon is probably one of the most promising areas for organic viticulture, and it is a little bit of a disappointment that this topic was not covered in more detail.And although I am in the Northeast, I find this book to be a useful reference, and my copy is starting to show some wear and tear."
3,Smoke not complete,I guess that Jimmy Dean and Jerry Reed got lost in the smoke as neither of their classic smokin' songs are included on the CD. Peggy Lee and Tex Williams are however. They add to the fun but this collection is no classic.
3,"Good, but leaving you wanting for more.","This is a basic book, nothing overly challenging here. The concept is well explained in general terms, but then repeated far too much in the manner that there was nothing else to say yet imprudently it continues. At points I was saying to myself ""get on already"".The text assumes you have a knowledge of art history while the illustrations hold your hand on the way through.The amount of text is slim with general statements and no real depth. The illustrations are plentiful. The result is like a powerpoint presentation in book form.Is it worth a read? Well, yes it is. The ideas contained within are worth exploring and understanding. Personally I agree with most of the concept.I am glad I bought it used and not at the full price."
1,what????,"The author has written a senseless book trying too hard to simplify art and it's interpretation. I was expecting something elightening and informative, something that would help guide me when going to museums. She tries to succumb the ""sucker"" into defining what is and isn't art in HER terms.The book is cluterred with unsubstantive one- liner, opinions about 2-d, photocopied artwork (that horde precious space in the book and will never do justice to the actual artwork).I learned nothing except that I will think twice before buying something from Penguin Publishers. How could this laughable picture book slip through the pressing machines at a major publishing company, I will never know."
4,Great bike for the money,My 9 yr old loves this bike and he loves the Camo thats all over bike. He rides it everday and its in great shape~ He is all boy if you know what I mean and is standing up to him..A great buy.
5,One of the best Xmas albums I've ever heard!,"This is technically an ep, clocking in at around 30 min., although there is a bonus track. Simply, this is unbelievably great pop! ""Blue December"" is the prettiest xmas ballad I've heard. Feat. all originals plus a beautiful arrangement of ""Away in a Manger"", A Sunflower at xmas is just the ticket to put the joy back in the holiday season. As in any Pearlfishers release there are echoes of Bacharach, Brian Wilson, McCartney, and Todd, but never slavish or just copied. David Scott (main Pearlie) is a total original in how he puts things together and you'll be hard pressed to find a better album this year! A must have."
3,IRAKERE'S JAMING CD,"IRAKERE is no longer the band it use to be,chucho valdes change the singer and that definity changed their original style..."
2,Mixed of old and new,"Okay, the track that start off, 14 i believe, are all newly records artist. I had no idea that Ace made new relases, that is the first part. the second part... the last two tracks by Jo & Ann, sounds like bad 45 needle drops, very awful. ACE uk has put out ""Ooh Wee Baby"" and I'm not sure about ""Curiosity"" by Jo & Ann, but if you want oldies, stay clear!Curious about new R&B; artist of 1997, your call."
4,This is an entertaining & educational video for ages 3-8.,"The video educates and entertains it's audience in a fun, adventurous way. Throughout the ""adventure"", children are taught about the differnt types of motorcycles and the necessary safety precautions that go along with riding. We got this when my son was around 3 1/2 and he is still entertained by it at 7."
5,Great for motorcycle loving kids!,My son who just turned 4 LOVES this video. He has watched it many times and asks for it over and over. It is great if mommy needs 30 minutes of quiet time! Any kid who is into motorcycles should get this video!
4,Fun series for preschoolers,"Our family has watched three of the ""There goes a ..."" series and enjoyed them very much. Dave's goofy screw-ups are enjoyable for even the grown-ups to watch, and there's great footage and basic information. Sometimes the ""plot"" gets a little bogged down but overall it's a fun way for kids to get a feel for what it's like to be in the driver's seat. We will definitly check out the rest of the series."
3,David Holmes - My Mate Paul,"David Holmes' _My Mate Paul_, a slice of danceable funk with a nice piano stab, gets remixed here by Matt Ducasse and Toshi Nakanishi of Skylab and the duo of Patrick Pulsinger and Tunakan. Skylab's ""Heck Mix"" is psychedelic downtempo, full of quivering synths and spaced-out sounds. Pulsinger and Tunakan, however, go for a spare electro feel on their ""My Mainman Paul Mix"" that brings the funk into a techno context. Odd, but appealing."
2,Where's the magnetism?,I bought this hoping to get a more detailed understanding of magnetism so that I could mathematically describe the interaction of magnetic forces for simulation purposes. What I got was a book on electricity that had an introductory chapter on how magnetism and electricity are interrelated. If you are looking for material on magnetism I suggest you go elsewhere because there won't be much here for you.
3,It is dated.,"This book was written more than 100 years ago. Much has happened in the electrical field since then. The book has some interesting things from the early history of electrical discovery and those are enduring. It also uses a number of pages to describe adaptations to telegraph systems that would have been easier to understand with some diagrams added, but those systems almost certainly have been replaced by now, clever as they were at the time. I did learn a couple of interesting things."
3,Entertaining but could have been better.,"Over all I liked it. The flashbacks could have been eliminated, we had just seen those scenes. Also, scenes from another episode could have been added if there were no flashbacks. The episode when Zin is entombed under the Watchfire would have been my choice. It flows with the finding of the key. This would have easily raised my rating to 4 stars."
1,description was deceiving,When I was doing a search I asked for the series Tracker. The year it was on I loved it. I thought I was getting the 8 or 10 episodes that was on Sci Fi. What a waste of money. If you hadn't seen the seies you wouldn't have a clue what that dvd was even about. I haven't seen any of these repeats on Sci Fi or I would record them myself. I will definitely be more careful in the future as to what I am getting.
2,Laughably bad...,"One could have a cheesy sci-fi film fest with this movie,""DNA"",""The Wraith"",""Deep Impact""&""Shark Attack."" This movie definitely qualifies...In the beginning,Adrian Paul comes to earth,and being pure energy (like so many Star Trek creatures),sees the picture of an underwear model&takes; on his form.He explains to a hapless earthling woman that he's out to get cosmic prison escapees.So,it's ""Prison Break"",except there are millions of rogue aliens roaming the universe.Great.He demonstrates how he traps their life force&zaps; them back to the Galactic Big House.Okay,it lacks plot,it lacks great special effects---what's wrong with that?"
2,Not a good choice,"The notion of ""Teach Yourself"" would be a bit of a reach no matter what, but this DVD is almost useless without all the supporting materials.It is poorly organized,hard to use, difficult to follow, and pretty much a waste of money. This is especially sad since most of the ""Alfred"" programs are great."
4,Teach yourself piano,"good dvd on teaching piano but it's a little boring.[...]This guy teaches piano for free and is a little more interesting, even though he is a dork. He is a better teacher in my opinion.Check out his website at [...]use his teachings and if you want buy this dvd and use her teachings as well. Just like billiards pool or anything else I want to learn in life, I take advice and help from everywhere. (Books, DVDs, Experts, Friends, and Random people) Helps you develope your own style. You take in what you want to from all these places.... on piano I like a lot of the blues and reggae, reggaeton, hip-hop, beats, rock, techno, trance... making new music. On the pool table same thing you get your own style.This dvd helps my piano skills a lot. It was worth the money. :D"
3,So much smaller than I expected,"Maybe it's my fault for having chosen a product with no specific measurements listed, but this figurine is SOOO tiny. I just expected it to be a bit taller and more sturdy. It's no more than 2 inches high, very thin plastic, and the packaging was labeled for Japanese sale. Cool little trinket, but if you're expecting something to play with or a decent sized figuring, look somewhere else."
5,CHRISTMAS PRESENT,"MY SON LOVED IT... BACK IN MAY 18, 2012. MY SON, WIFE & MY 4 GRANDKIDS LOST EVERYTHING IN THERE TRAILER FIRE... EVERYTHING, HE IS A BIG BIG NIGHT MARE BEFORE CHRISTMAS FAN. I BUY WHATERVER I CAN FIND FOR HIM. NOW I HAVE TO DO A LOT OF REPLACING.. I MEAN EVERYTHING.. HE SURE DID LOVE THE SANTA JACK...."
1,Hypnosis Joke,"Total waste of money......returned 10 days ago to CANADA, have not received a refund. Very disappointed.Don't buy it."
3,flawed but still somewhat interesting,"This book uses a highly unscientific survey to divide a group of Orthodox Jews into ""traditionalist"", ""centrist"" and ""nominally Orthodox"" categories. Though the survey doesn't involve a truly random sample of Orthodox Jews (and thus does not create useful data) it still reminds us that (a) there are all kinds of ways to be Orthodox but (b) even ""nominally Orthodox"" Jews tend to be more observant than non-Orthodox Jews."
1,Book: A piece of my heart,"Got this book because it was one we were to read in our book club. It is a piece of trash. The back cover didn't indicate this, and I read about 50 pages, hoping it would be an ok read. After thumbing through it to see if it would be a worthwhile read, I threw this garbage in the recycle bin. Please don't waste you time."
4,texasmusicfan,"This is a great CD. I know, ""A four-star for a great CD."" This is a great CD for any fan, if you are new to Cooder Graw, this is a great first purchase. It's not as emotionally drawn as their self titled CD, but it keeps you involved through the whole CD. ""Willie's Guitar"" is as great as ""Motel Lights"" in their self-titled, but doesn't carry a crowd quite the same. Once again, if you are new to Cooder Graw, this is a great first buy of theirs, then buy their self-titled for a better look into their music and a better written album, in my opinion."
2,Not Moon Safari 2,"If you loved Moon Safari from Air, be warned this CD is totally different, a lot darker. Moon Safari offered a fresh sound, music that made you happy. I had huge expections, so I ordered this CD weeks before it was released. BIG disappointment !"
2,Forgettable,"This is definitely not a sequel to Moon Safari. The melodies are very Beatlesesque in an annoying, distracting way and left me wanting to put on The White Album instead. Other songs don't have much of an impact at all. The last track features distracting, melodramatic spoken word."
2,This is NOT Moon Safari!,"Not even close. Pretty dull, repetitive, lifeless tracks. I pretty much expected that from a soundtrack for a movie called ""Virgin Suicides"" but given the strength of Air's Moon Safari -- one of the best CD's ever -- I bought it anyway. This sounds a lot more like a watered down soundtrack to ""Rocky Horror Picture Show"" than a follow-up to Moon Safari. I won't be listening to it again."
2,moon safari is better,"sure, Playground Love is an amazing tune, but I didnt find the rest of the tracks as good as Moon Safari"
1,THEY WERE BORED. They had to be.,"I bought this album on the breathtaking brilliance of AIR's earlier releases, and boy was I disappointed. I am delighted to accept changes in a band's style, as long as they indicate growth rather than stagnation. ""Playground Love"" is a decent single, but most of the rest of the album is MUZAK with a capital BORING. ""The word 'Hurricane'"" is a sweet idea, but doesn't stand up to repeated listening. The last track has a few lines from the book thrown in, and the lines themselves are interesting and well-done. Unfortunately they are spoken in a flat monotone with an annoying electronic effect that effectively removes all emotional content. You want Hypnotic and Darkly Imaginative? Get a copy of Plastikman's ""Consumed"" and never look back at this twaddle. AIR owes me fifteen bucks and I want it back."
3,hmmmmm...,"To put it simply, this does not match moon safari or premieres symptomes. The record is definitely Air, but does not capture the talent of the musicians. The bass lines are not as exciting and the songs use the same theme throughout. This music may be perfect for the movie. After my first listen, I felt as if Air could have written this album in a weekend. They seemed afraid to play. Where are fender rhodes and hammond grooves? Interesting album, but try the others first."
4,Never buy furniture tainted by death...,"As always, Air excels in creating music that captures half-remembered dreams. This album is about 40 minutes long, with the tracks between 3 & 5 minutes each. Very atmospheric and edgy. ''The word 'Hurricane' '' is my favorite track."
1,Disappointed,I thought that there would be more of the fantastic '70-'80 music but was not on here! I guess I should have been more thorough in researching before I purchased it.
4,Works perfectly with the film; sounds good on its own.,"Any fan of Sofia Coppola's brilliant directorial debut must own this soundtrack, because the sounds of Air, which are sprinkled liberally throughout the film, keep the haunting images of the movie salient in one's mind. Too bad that many of these songs are fragments; the best tracks are the ones that are fleshed out and sound complete: ""Playground Love,"" ""The Word 'Hurricane',"" ""Dirty Trip,"" ""High School Lover,"" and especially the addictive groove of ""Dead Bodies."" The music itself definitely has a 70s feel to it, with the rhythm section evoking Pink Floyd, but there's a trance-y, kind of techno-ish feel to the songs that makes them still sound fresh. You'll like the soundtrack a lot better if you see the film, and you should definitely check out the movie."
3,"remember, it's just a film score.","As an album ""The Virgin Suicides"" is a huge failure. As a score, a triumphant success. In the past year, Air, has become one of my favorite bands and have reignited my intrest in electronic music. I didn't buy this album, and I am grateful that I burned a copy for less then a dollar. Of the 13 tracks here, 1 stands alone (""Playground Love"") and it's the reason this record got 3 stars from me. This record should only be for Air enthusiasts or people who really loved Sofia Copella's film. I would absolutley hate for someone to go buy this record and judge Air on it. Please, Please go get ""Moon Safari"", it might change your life."
3,Airheads should not be disapointed if they expect a score,"It's not a great album per se, but as a soundtrack Coppala was wise in choosing Air. Besides being a little repetitious with a few doubly-tracked songs (including of course their smash Playground Love), this still plays more gracefully then their pretentious sophomore release, suggesting the spacey compositions of Moon Safari with a little added spookiness to boot."
2,Not a good listening CD,"I bought this CD after thoroughly liking Moon Safari and Talkie Walkie. This CD would probably make a really good soundtrack as background music for the movie, but it wasn't a good CD. Most of the songs are boring and repetitive, with just different variations on the same theme."
1,Pathetically boring...,"After listening to this offering from Air for a third time, I must say that this recording doesn't add anything of value neither to the development of Air's musique, nor to music at large. It is sad that the french duo failed to produce something innovative and unique when the expectations for that to happen were high. I guess they ran out of ideas after Moon Safari, or the pressure of putting out an album of comparable quality got to them. The songs seem more like afterthoughts that never materialized, too close to muzak for my taste. Good thing I can always detox from the dullness of this generic and bland tribute to mediocrity by listening to Kid Loco, or just about anyone playing for free in Golden Gate Park any weekend. Air just disappeared on thin..."
3,Not what I expected,I was hoping to hear all of the awesome 70's music they played during the basement party scene and to each other with the boys over the phone. There were Todd Rundgren songs etc. This soundtrack was only the music performed by Air. I was a bit bummed. The music isn't bad but starts to sound all the same.
2,I dunno...,"Had high hopes for this one, after the majesty of their previous releases. But their soundtrack leaves me shaking my head (and not up-and-down). Maybe you need to see the film, I don't know. (But then again, I've only seen a few of the Italian films that Morricone scored, and those scores are always sensational) The ""songs"" seem, for the most part, like undeveloped snippets of ideas. And Air doesn't give these snippets any time to develop - as soon as a groove is developed it's faded out. And I've always enjoyed the grooves that Air gave us. This album couldashouldwoulda been much better, much longer. A few tracks stand out, but the overall feeling is of ideas half thought-out, half-developed. Overall this is an album that is too conservative, and has too much of a been there/done that feel. No growth, no chances taken. But still I'll probably listen to it 40 times more. After all it's still Air."
2,Wait for the next album,"This album, to fit in with the tone of the film, is eerie rather than ambient, and so is not to everyones tastes. Whilst it is a succesful soundtrack, in that it creates a fitting atmosphere, the suicidal air is not one which I felt comfortable with at home. 'Playground Love' and 'Highschool Lover' are the two exceptions, but this album is a far cry from the superb 'Moon Safari' and quality 'Premiers Symptomes', both of which are musts. This is an album only for the fanatical."
2,Definitely not on the same level as Moon Safari.,"After being delighted with Moon Safari, I was eager to lay down money and buy Virgin Suicides. I wish that I had not. This CD has a great song, Playground Love. The other tracks seem like boring versions of this same track. I know this is a soundtrack CD, but it stays at the same low dynamic level. Sorry Air, I still have faith in you."
2,not your playground love,"i would like to change my opinion of this album. Not worth it. I pretended for weeks that I liked it, but I was just humoring myself. Playground love is a good song, but the rest of the album is not good music. They have the same eerie sound, but it can only go so far. If you like to listen to creepy, uninteresting music, check this out. If you want to hear chillin' tunes with a groove, check out Air's other albums, which are approximately mille times better than this. Remember, it is a soundtrack, not an album."
4,Playground Love,"I was in my local record store when I heard the track ""Highschool Lover"" playing. I stopped and listened to the whole thing. I then immediately proceeded to the counter to ask what was playing. After they told me what it was, I felt like an idiot since I had just seen the movie a few weeks previous to this. But I wasn't familiar with the band Air. So a while later I finally bought it.The first track really hooks you in and manages to effortlessly carry you through the rest of the album. There's a very mellow mood present. In fact, be careful when listening to this CD. I had it on in my car and it was beginning to lull me to sleep.My only complaint is, as mentioned, it runs short. Certain tracks should definitely be longer. But besides that, it was a great introduction to Air."
3,A soundtrack... not an Air album,"I really don't know what I was thinking getting so excited about this CD. Perhaps it was the disappointment generated by the lacklustre stopgap that was Premiere Symptoms. But... it's a soundtrack. The pieces lack individuality and to a certain extent creativity. It's over way too soon and leaves a bad taste after expecting some sort of redemption near the end that never arrives. I would recommend this only to the Air completist. Otherwise, get ""Moon Safari"" and stick with that until they come out with a real sophomore effort."
4,The Perfect Soundtrack,"With the Virgin Suicides soundtrack Air managed to capture all the melancholic feel of the 70's (both book and film are based on that particular decade) taking cues from cornerstone classics like Pink Floyd, David Bowie or Novalis' Sommerabend, while still sounding fresh and innovative.That is not to say that this is your typical Air, so beware, if you want another Moon Safari, Walkie Talkie is the one to buy.Virgin Suicides is an excellent electronica album with lots of old school drums, killer bass guitar and excessive use of analog keys. What's not to love?"
4,Breathe in the Air,"Although this soundtrack is composed mostly of repetitions and variations on a handfull of musical passages, each of these themes in succession manage to hold together as a fully fleshed out work, and the album remains my favorite of the duo's output. Pink Floyd comparisons are inevitable, as the closest reference to the mood present here is the ringing notes at the beginning of Floyd's Shine on You Crazy Diamond. Though don't underestimate the band's unique approach to revisionism. What could have easily materialized as uneventful 70s-styled mood music to complement the setting of the film is instead invested by Air with a certain melancholy eloquence that allows the music to take on it's own identity when removed from the film. In fact, much of the music was finished after the movie. Hearing this before I saw the Virgin Suicides, I must confess that for myself, the film's fell short in living up to the emotional potential that a soundtrack of this magnitude entails."
3,Air is not getting better,I was somewhat disappointed to listen to the latest Air release. Moon Safari was one of the best albums of the last decade and the Virgin Suicides soundtrack clearly isn't. Especially the booklet was disappointing. There is none at all. I would have expected a soundtrack to include some info about the film.
5,Light Up Some Incense...,"This is the most relaxing album I have heard in a long time. Tranquil, hushed, and hypnotic. The perfect album for lazy meditation, a quiet evening, or falling asleep in a candlelit room. It's a bit expensive for its length (only 30 minutes or so), but I still recommend the CD; it has not left my stereo once since I bought it, and it accompanies me nightly as I drift into unconsciousness."
4,"It's just a soundtrack, but a good one","Many reviewers have correctly pointed out the differences between this soundtrack and ""Moon Safari"". I would like to add that I liked this CD better. It's more atmospheric, more original, and subtly dark. Organs, moog, and bass abound. Not much human voice. It reminds me a lot of soundtracks of italian movies of the 70s. It really sounds like 70s progressive rock interpreted with a 90s sensibility. The dominant mood is a melancholic one. One should not forget that this is a soundtrack, meant to play an ancillary role to the images. Judging it by its own sake is a bit unfair."
3,A good drill,This is a great drill combo but I have found that I need the saw much more than I needed the right-angle drill ( buy the saw combo instead! ). I don't think the 18V drills are needed except by the heavy user. I am a first-time home buyer and have yet to have a need for the 18V
4,A must read for Burns lovers,"R=This book is a comprehensive review of that ancient and lasting annaul geathering : the Burns Supper. The centerpiece of the event is the toast to the poet himself, known as the Immortal Memory. The speech takes the form of a special tribute and commentary as to why this 18th century poet farmer from an obscure corner of the globe remains so popular and relevant today.This book is a superb aid to anyone invited to give this speech, and in fact to anyone who has fallen under the spell of Burns' magic ability to write poetry."
3,One star removed because of Joan d'Arc...,"This is an outstanding book, especially because it proposes a new interpretation tool using the Saros cycle to evaluate the effect of eclipses in predictive astrology. The other parts can be found in others publications, even if the methods presented here are clear exposed, in a didactic way.However, I have never understood why prominent astrologers want to illustrate their way of intepretation (when they do it, and very often they don't do it at all) and their findings with spurious charts. The case of Joan d'Arc is typical: how can we be sure of the day and time of Joan d'Arc's birth, who lived in the countryside and was most probably the daughter of a farmer? This should be considerated as a speculative chart."
5,Top shelf!,"This is a fantastic book. Clearly written and remarkably insightful. Her section about the aspects was not long, only 7 and 1/2 pages, but it had the best description of the aspects that I've found! Far superior to even the book ""Aspects in Astrology"", which you would expect to be great on the subject. Brady not only gives insights into meanings in predictive work, but she also outlines great methods for practical application - sort of a ""drag and drop"" approach that is beneficial for helping students keep track of the pieces. Her section on the progressed lunation cycle was actually pretty good, but I disagreed with some of her wording between the full moon phase and the disceminating phase. I recommend Demetra George's book ""Finding Our Way Through the Dark"" to supplement that section. But, all in all, it's one of my favorite books and I definitely recommend it."
1,waste of trees,"this book , i purchased , due to not having this particular astrology book,,and the high rated reviews on it. To my finding,,this book has very minimal information that is good..and the rest is just ""fluff"". Really a waste of trees. I dont know how it got such high reviews,,,but i think it has to do with friends of the author in some cases.skip this one and check out others."
4,Saint Saga #21,"Nine short stories, the final collection in which the Saint is still clearly based in London.Unlike some readers, I've always preferred the full-length Saint adventures and the ""novellas"". This set is up to the standard of previous pre-war short stories, though, my favourite being ""The Wicked Cousin"".And in the creepy final tale, we meet again Ivor Nordsten, who figured so prominently inThe Misfortunes of Mr. Teal.P.S. For a list of — and discussion of — all Charteris's Saint books, see my So You'd Like To... Guide."
2,Perhaps I'm missing something.,"Maybe I'm not hearing what other people are hearing. I see several reviews with this CD ranked with five stars. I followed those reviews when I purchased this CD. I was thoroughly disappointed. Jonathan Pierce does have a good voice, but a good voice alone does not make a good CD. The musical style of the songs is strange (something about a white guy trying to sing gospel soul; doesn't work). The lyrics are not really that inspirational. From what I've heard of his previous works, For You does not stand up with them. Unless you prefer odd musical mixes and artist experience-specfic lyrics, I recommend one of his earlier CDs."
1,"Stay away, paint chips immediately",We got this camera for my 6 month old for Christmas. He really enjoyed playing with it. But the orange paint on the button at the top started chipping off just two days after Christmas. The paint chips off very easily. It comes off in small flecks with light rubbing. That's definitely not a good feature for babies who like to put everything in their mouths. So we had to trash an otherwise entertaining toy. Stay away from this toy.
3,Deceptive Ad,"I bought these to apply medication to my body, expecting them to be medical-grade (since it is advertised as being sold by BP Medical Supplies) and therefore, sterile.The product I got was not a box of 1000 Cotton-Tipped Applicators as shown in the picture.It was 10 plain-wrapped packages of 100 non-sterile cotton swabs that had double labels.One label states They are manufactured for ECC Corp. out of Tucson, Az.The second glue-on label states these were made in China for MaxMed Medical Supplies out of Brooklyn, NY.They were sent by a distributor called IBrn Distributors. Nowhere is BP Medical Supplies mentioned.Probably excellent for cleaning objects. Not so good for medical uses.Probably should not be listed for use as a health/beauty item as a person would be taking a chance with a non-sterile swab."
5,Great item!,"These cotton tipped applicators are perfect for cleaning small channels, grooves, recesses and hard to reach places in firearms. The cotton tip doesn't fall apart or shred and the wooden stick comes in handy for scraping harder to remove gunk."
3,"The price was right, but somewhat flimsey","Amount of cotton on the stick was good for cleaning or application, however the wooden sticks are rough and have splinters. Some have broken with very little pressure."
3,Not as heavy duty wooden stick as I wanted,"I was hoping for a wooden stick that wouldn't crack under medium pressure for cleaning. Other than that, they work as anticipated."
1,no show and no reply,ordered on Dec 23 Items never showed up and when i emailed asking how they were sent mid Jan. got no reply. Amazon gave me a credit
1,the kids kid dynamite beat up in school,"If you want a band that is about to play their schools battle of the bands, here ya go. This is what happens when you sign a bunch of kids still in high school and your not d.b.s from Canada. Lyrically, alot of whining and selfpity. I've heard emo with more meaningful anger(now thats insulting). Buy the New Bomb turks, Down by Law, hell buy the Rezillos. Borrow this from a friend and tape it. This is for your kid that masturbates about his classmates after school, goes skating, then drives his Mazda home and still thinks life is tough. Good title(im not a complete ass)."
5,LIFE vs. DEATH,"This book had an incredible influence on me. It's Freudian interpretation impacted my views of both society and history. The influence one man can have over a million. The ability to awaken and influence a crowd of individuals into a single mob. This book helped me understand both my own and the mass psyche. It's thesis that mankind must be viewed as largely unaware of its own desires, hostile to life, and unconsciously bent on self-destruction at the time I read it had great appeal for me. Brown wrote repression had not only caused individual neurosis but social pathology as well. From this I conclude that crowds could have sexual neurosis much like those of individuals, and that these derangements could be quickly and effectively diagnosed and then 'treated'. This book is a must for anyone interested in figuring out the human psyche."
1,Just not funny,"This book has only one theme, bodily functions, and it repeats the theme over and again. It is painful to read."
5,Absolutely hysterical! Laugh out loud funny!,I just read the first two chapters and have been laughing out loud! He has amazing creativity and is truly a wordsmith. Well worth the price paid. I hope Feherty continues to write more books because they keep getting funnier!
4,Don't get TOO excited.,"I had to take a star away because this disc doesn't even come close to The GBA's West Coast Boogaloo which, in my humble opinion, is the finest work of each of the musicians on that album. A lot of you may not agree, but A Town Called Earth and KDTU's stuff do not have the same strength in melody. Maybe some will agree with that. Thing is, after reading the reviews I immediately called around until I found this thing and went and bought it, hoping it would have some of the melodic magic that I know these guys are capable of. Honestly, I was a little disappointed."
3,Odd Reminiscences,"The subtitled reminiscences of elderly Iraqi-born Jews who were forced, in their young adulthood, to leave their homeland and settle in Israel. None of these people were able to accomodate themselves or feel at home in their new country. Instead, they complain of being discriminated against, and wax sentimentally about an Iraq that nurtured them in the beginning but eventually persecuted and expelled them."
4,MSA,"This is a great movie for the practice of Arabic. A lot of the speaking is in MSA, which is good for those who want to become fluent in the official Arabic language. The subjects are interesting, but it gets boring after a while. It is also interesting to hear about Israel from the Arabs. Sort of funny to hear. The quality of the movie is great, which makes it easier to watch, and the sound is great, which makes it easy to understand."
5,product as advertised,The product arrived quickly and is exactly as advertised...I am totally satisfied with quality and price. I would recommend to a friend.
1,magnetic nut drivers by Neiko,I received Neiko Pro Grade 5 piece nut driver set in a timely manner and was happyuntil I left the set on the dash of my van for a couple days. I was very surprised tofind that they had all rusted. That just tells me that they are not of very good quality.I have several others that have not rusted in the van for many years. I was verydisappointed.
3,Lite Duty use ONLY ......,"Magnets fall out under stress which defeats the purpose........Probably not for use in Impact Drive as some ""Amazon Tags"" suggest."
3,Caps yes Nuts nope,"Good price and handy but magnets reduce the depth of the hex end so it is too shallow for tightening nuts if the bolt protrudes at all. These work great for cap head bolts (hex) and other hex head fasteners. Should have called them Hex Bolt Drivers. Bonus - the holder has 3 extra holes which are just right to hold my 1/4, 3/8 and 1/2 hex to socket drivers. I have been using these for hand tightening and light duty power driving (sheet metal)."
5,Great Quality product.,Pros:Does the job. fits perfectly to the impact driver and to the sockets it is made for.Cons:Did not really find any.
1,Dont Dare do it.... don't purchase the Passion Productions / Miracle Pictures Version of Africa Screams!!!,"What the !!!???!!!I ordered the Hal Roach Studios version of the classic film Africa Screams. A vendor sent me this 2 movies on 1 (dual side/single layer) Flipper - DVD version instead. So, i may as well rate it.Passion Productions is the first splash screen you see...then the africa Screams movie abruptly comes in (as if 4 or 5 seconds had been edited out [no mention of miracle pictures as noted on the cover art?].The picture is sooooooooooo soft, its almost just a washed out screen.DVD-5 / MPEG1 Audio 2.0 Dual Mono - absolutely NO compression...the background hiss is so loud, its hard to make out the words.Here is the total rating....SKIP IT!!!!!! NNNNoooooo..... dont do it... okay maybe for $.01 :)(Of course, I'm waiting for the amazon vendor to reply so I can get the version I ordered as I send this junk back).Great movie though.ps. - dont you dare do it...."
4,Masterful wordsmith,"John Fowles masterfully plunges us into 19th century Victorian England with its social customs, sexual taboos and moral attitudes. Charles, engaged to Ernestina becomes fascinated with Sarah Woodruff, a multi-faceted character. The book is totally unique, not just because of John Fowles ability as a wordsmith, but because of the unique point of view. His 1960's narrator (when the book was written) comments on the lives and interactions of the 19th century characters.Reviewed by Holly Weiss, author of Crestmont"
2,BAIT AND SWITCH,"The used copy of this book was marked ""in good condition"" without mentioning any writing inside the book, as other sellers had done. I was looking for a gift book and found instead the following caption on the second page: ""To Gwen with love, Jon."" I was looking for a used book to give to a friend as a Christmas gift. The writing therein rendered it unable to be given as a gift. I tried to white out the writing, but only ruined the print which spilled down to the first page of the book and erased the print. I finally had to throw the book away and bought another copy at a local bookstore. I feel that it was a ""bait and switch"" sale and not happy with the seller. I won't buy from them again. This was not my usual experience. Generally sales agent is truthful about the product being sold, stating all defects of text and cover, all handwritten notes."
1,Emperor has no clothes.,"This is one of those books that appeal to the pretentious. The author is self-conscious and clever and has obviously written it with literary critics and English teachers and the sort of pseudo-intellectual that hangs out in New York cafes in mind. The actual story was the last thing on his mind and it shows--the whole thing is a pastiche with what plot there is used to parade his annoying characters (Camus or Satre heroes in Victorian dress) and to make annoying observations (all the last word in philosophy circa 1960 but really dull in 2006). Nothing could be more contrived than the alternate endings that one must pick from. The reader does not want to pick an ending, to be truthful, because the author has not made the reader CARE. I think I will continue reading actual Victorian novels, by the likes of Dickens, Trollope and Eliot rather than ever bothering to re-read this nonsense."
3,This is not what you think it is,"...but go ahead and let the book blindside you for the full effect!People would ask me what I was reading, and I respond with a typical ""oh, it's about a young gentleman who begins to reconsider his approaching marriage when he notices a forlorn young woman who wanders the beach, pining for her lost lover..."" And person who had posed the question would say ""how nice."" NO! This book has nothing to do the gentle, romantic, Victorian plot, setting, and mood that the author so carefully crafts before...well...you'll just have to read it to get the full effect, as I said. I suspect i was lulled into an unsuspecting state by trying to focus on the plot of the story, and I honestly still haven't sorted the ending out. If there's an answer to the mystery of the French Lieutenant's woman, I completely missed it. A mind-blowing, if frustrating reading experience."
2,irritating,"This is certainly a parody of victorian pomposity, and made me detest every character Fowles throws at you. The writing style is excessively pompous and hard to follow. There is not one character that you like, or feel for, or care about. If Fowles' aim was to create a cast of characters that bored you to death, he succeeded.He also must have wanted to make you hate him as well, the way he's so up himself in this book; one chapter is devoted entirely to how brilliant Fowles is at creating people out of words.The only reason I had for finishing this book was so I could appreciate the film in greater depth, which (somehow) brought a little character to these two-dimensional, cardboard cut-out representations of Victorian literature."
2,Usual Fowles,"John Fowles has a real problem with writing endings to his novels. Witness this book and The Magus. TFLW is an overly lengthy novel that essentially has a misguided man chasing after a very mentally warped man-hating woman. For years no less! Since Fowles can't seem to end a plot he wrote TWO to end it. So, you can have your pick. What could have been a very nice novel indeed was turned into a pointless piece of drivel. Madame Bovary is fifty times more interesting and has a great ending. Sorry I cannot be more positive about this. And the movie is an abomination of the novel! LOL>"
5,Terry Pratchett - need I say more?,"As always from Mr Pratchett a great story - lots of wit, humour and favourite DiskWorld characters. On to the next book..."
5,Fantastic Light...,"Mr. P. has become one of my top authors. I love the fact that he is neutral on every aspect in life. He makes fun of birth, life, death, the unknown, worries, nightmares, jobs eg. politicians, cops, doctors, miners, healers, mystics, ""DEATH"", etc. He is hitting every aspect of every day life and poking fun at it. This is awesome. Someone who realizes that life is serious, but not that serious. He basically states with his writting to ""take a step back to see how bad others have it compared to one's self."""
4,Fun Read,"This is a good, fun read. The witty humor makes you laugh through the whole story. Fans of Fantasy/Sci Fi and good ole fashioned mirth will enjoy this book."
5,Awesome Story,"Great Story, I'm a big fan of Rincewind and the Luggage. This story kept me entertained the whole way through."
4,One step forward...,"...without the two steps back. The adventures of Rincewind continue in a more dynamic writing in a generally better book. But, of course, as it's really the second part to The Color of Magic, the book won't make sense if you haven't read CoM."
4,"Much Improved Over ""The Color of Magic""","I was unhappy with the book the first book in the series ""The Color of Magic"" for lacking a coherent plot. But ""The Light Fantastic"" does and it makes a world of difference. Discworld is further developed, new characters are introduced, and the story is engaging.I enjoyed the book, but I found the main characters a bit flat. Twoflower is a fearless tourist, and Rincewind is a cowardly wizard who cant use magic. Together they are more or less blown by the winds of fate from adventure to adventure. But the adventures are entertaining and humorous. Only near the end does Rincewind take his fate into his own hands, and we see him driven by internal forces instead of external chance. And that I like.If the books continue to improve at this rate, I might have to consider myself a Discworld fan."
3,Not What I Expected...,"Perhaps I was spoiled by all the reccomendations I had heard comparing Pratchett to Douglas Adams. So, when I bought the first two Discworld books I expected to get an experience much like what I got out of Hitchhikers Guide. That's not at all what I got. I was disappointed with The Color of Magic, more a colection of occasionally ammusing stories, than a truly funny novel, but ""Light"" held a bit more promise. Pratchett is still no Adams. Rather than the crazed, zany, wonderfully pointless wit in ""Guide"", ""Light"" was sporadically funny, with an interesting plot and somewhat intriguing characters. So while I enjoyed the book, my expectations were too high to consider it a truly great experiense. I'm hoping for more from the later books though."
3,Far from the best!,"This book is OK, althought it isn't even a half as good as the later Discworld books. So why isn't this book as good?That's becouse there's nothing more than simple jokes here. In the later books, Prathcett puts in more thoughts about life and such, and it isn't just funny laughing all the time. But don't get me wrong. This still is worth to read!"
3,"Good, Steady Introduction","Here we see the continuation of the first adventure of Rincewind the wizard (with ""Wizzard"" spelled out on his hat). In spite of everything, I just have to like him, and it is so much fun reading about how silly wizards behave on Discworld - dressing in fancy costumes and eating dinners all the time with only occasional magic. And Cohen the Barbarian is very funny, too."
4,Not Free SF Reader,"While not as funny as the first Discworld book, this follow-up is still pretty funny, and some of the Cohen the barbarian bits and other things like that definitely get a laugh.Pratchett is continuing his Douglas Adams style fantasy rift, and it is pretty enjoyable, overall."
4,Funny and satirical,I love Terry Pratchet's writing. He creates a world that is funny and at the same time provides satirical comment about out world and other fantasy writers. You need to be able to allow your imagination to run wild!
4,A Majorly Funny and Interesting Read!!,"The Light Fantastic is fantasy lover's comical paradise. It is about an inept wizard, Rincewind, who is forced to save Discworld, the world, with the one thing he has never been able to do: magic. One main element is its comical and often different description. Terry Pratchett constantly uses a twist o say something simple in a complex way. Anti-fairytale references and beliefs are a prominent element in this book. The most recurring element is ll the randomness. The problem with this is it slows you down in the first half of the book. The Light Fantastic is full of fantasy, comedy and plainly a few messed up ideas and is definitely and interesting adult read."
3,Its okay if you give it a miss...,"Picks up where 'Colour of Magic' left off. Rincewind and Twoflower is thrown from one problem to another with a quick solution always close at hand to help them.Actually, you should only read 'Colour of Magic' and 'Light Fantastic' if you are a completist. Otherwise, I recommend readers new to the Discworld to start with the 3rd book featuring the Witches or better yet the 4th book featuring DEATH.'Light Fantastic' isnt bad. In fact I think its slightly better than the first book. But like I said you wont miss anything much if you dont read them and jump straight to 'Equal Rites' or 'Mort'.Rincewind, despite starring in a few other Discworld novels, has never quite reached the popularity of other Discworld regulars like the City Watch, Granny Weatherwax or DEATH. I dont know why but I think Rincewind just doesnt have that much pizzazz as a character.Still, not a bad read."
2,Trys too hard to be funny,"This novel is the first of the Discworld series I've read.To me the author appears too impressed with his knowledgeof ancient myth and legend to make and real good jokes.The closest he comes for me is when in the spirit world he meets the fetching girlwho is death's daughter. The most interesting character in the book is a prop:the luggage is a semi-intelligent suit case with legsthat eats people it doesn't like. The failed wizard whoignores the talking trees and isn't allowed to die becausehe has an important world saving spell in his head is the hero.Several of the running jokes like Cohen the Barbarian, the geriatric hero,are in pretty poor taste even.Another book I was so glad when I finished."
4,"Continues the adventure, nonstop comedy and action","Having read the first book Colour of Magic, this book was a continuation of the same constant action and adventure. However, there was a bit less uniqueness to this book than the first and a few more corny jokes, which is why I give it 4 stars. You won't be disappointed reading this one as well, and there is an important twist at the end if you've read the first in the series.I've read the first two books now and will keep reading Discworld, as it has a unique style to it and never gets boring!"
3,Good but not the best,"The entire discworld series is great, with some lesser books. The Light fantastic is one of them. Terry Prachett seemed to have to many good Ideas and tried to cram them into a small book, so the book seems to jump around alot. Other than that the book is decent. My favorite character is the luggage"
5,Wonderful,"If you haven't ever read Terry Pratchett, I highly recommend it! It's witty, exciting, colorful, and fun! He's brilliant and I've never read a book of his I didn't love!"
5,Couldn't put it down!,Recommended for anyone who enjoys smiling. Once you start reading this book be prepared to be unable to put it down until it is over!
4,Got mine from the dumpster,"I found a DW918 Cordless Flexible Floodlight, complete with battery, in the trash. It works. The battery is probably weak but it will charge in my 7-18v charger. It has a spare bulb mounted under the bezel. It would be really useful if it would also accommodate an 18v battery."
2,yes smooth is a good rapper,"i just wish there was more songs on here that was like strawberries.real melow and smooth.but this album is too folky,and alternative for me.but if she uses the same mellow fomula she used on the single strawberries she MIGHT do better.her name is smooth so i exspected a mellow SMOOTH album.she's also a gr8 rapper,more smooth mellow rap and r&b soul was definatly missing and needed on this album,unlike her others."
5,One of my all-time favorites ... !!,"I bought this album several years ago soon after it was released and I really found myself enjoying it from start to finish. This is one CD I tend to always pull from my cd stock whenever I want to take a break from the norm in the world of music. This album is definitely not like most R&B albums ... it has a sultry bluesy funkiness about it. I'll always name this album as a must have for my extensive music collection. Smooth really did a good job on this album and I'm happy to have it in my collection. Southernly Yours, Daphne (Always A Southerngirrl) .. Memphis,TN."
4,Smooth is much better than Foxy Brown!,Smooth is way better than Foxy Brown and her colleagues. Smooth has the thing that's really sexy and she can really give you some kinda nice grooves.
5,Smooth Review,This is a good CD. I enjoy all the songs. This particular album is not ITUNES and it should be. Keep selling this item.
2,Strawberries is Hot!,"I loved this song when it came out, I was a freshman in high school and I absolutely loved this song. The album is not all that good. I also liked Mind Blowin off the Low Down Dirty Shame soundtrack. I remember Smooth when she appeared on Immature's ""We got It"" and ""Watch Me do my Thing"" singles, I liked her a lot. Smooth is a tight rapper and singer and it seems like her brother Chris Stokes (Manager of B2K and ImX formally Immature) would have helped promote her more."
1,One Horrible Recording,I love Mel Torme but this is one bad recording. No Dolby sound processing and the PCM stereo recoding is one the worst I'v heard on a DVD. Great selection of songs but it's all a waste.
3,It's not that bad...,"In response to the first review:Everything was included, and I had my unit asssembled with little difficulty over the space of 10 minutes. That being said, the instructions were anything but clear (I didn't use them, I simply looked at the picture on the box). It took some guesswork to figure out what went where, and how. Also, the tolerances aren't so great, so the corners don't end up being square, which might partly explain the comment in the previous review that the holes don't line up.All that being said, I feel this was a decent solution to my problem: I needed a paper towel rack and a dish drainer. And it is certainly NOT ""impossible"" to assemble."
3,Just what our kitchen needed,"While I agree with the reviewer who was griping about the screws, the overall effect in our kitchen is great. This is definitely more sturdy than the wooden organizer that this replaced. It won't warp like the wooden one did. It is working out great. However, the screws were a pain to deal with. That is all."
1,poorly manufactured piece of crap,"1) The screws that came in the box have no relation to the screws shown on the assembly diagram--nor do they fit in the various holes available to screw them into.2) Even if the right screws came with it, the pieces are so mis-aligned that it would be impossible to assemble the unit. The screw holes just don't line up."
2,Unacceptable lack of illustrations,"I bought the paperback edition at a flea market recently (Nov 2007) and found it a generally enjoyable read. The author takes a chronological amble through British (mostly English) history and the relevant issues driving the evolution of the coinage. The last chapter on the future of the pound vs the Euro stands up quite well today even though it was written in 2000. However, as the author constantly mentions the beauty or ugliness of numerous different coins throughout history the complete lack of illustrations is unacceptable."
2,"basic quality, but where is the data for the examples",This book is not bad for browsing to see if anything haschanged from sql server 2000 to 2005.I like the book since it is clean and quick to go through.It would have helped if the author ziped up a detached version of the apressFinancial database since for a beginner this bookcan be a real pain in the neck to go through since no datato work with. the other problem I have with the book isthat it is misleading to say novice to professional.This book does not have even midlevel skills we need to domost database work with sql server 2005 let alone not introduce you to a majority of the new features of the sql server 2005 we need to do our jobs
4,Excellent for beginners,"This book was assigned reading for a SQL Server 2005 certification course that I am taking. It is well-written with a clear and concise database example that is followed through the entire text. The code that was given was not only good for teaching but I was also able to implement it in project work. It also has a pretty good beginner tutorial on Reporting Services and this book also goes into the basics of T-SQL.A deficiency that I found was there was discussion on triggers and sprocs but nothing at all regarding functions. Also, I think there should have been more time spent on indexes. I had to use a different reference to gain a proper understanding of the differences between clustered and non-clustered indexes. I also think that there should have been a few pages devoted to XML since it was mentioned in the book in quite a few places without proper introduction.All in all, this book is worth the buy if you are a beginner using SQL Server 2005 functionality."
4,Good quality ink for brush,"I've been happy with this. Good, clear ink, and looks great on paper. Dries quickly too. Gums a little in the cap, but otherwise fine quality."
2,Ugh,"I'm a good student, but I hated this book more than anything else I've read during my college career. Painfully dry."
5,great book!,"the book was in awesome condition. it looked brand new and had basically no markings inside it. it's exactly what i needed for my psych class and probably what anyone who takes a psych methods, or psych statistics would need."
5,Same thing,I paid less than 10dollares for this book and it is the same thing than the last edition version!
1,Waste of money,"This is without a doubt the worst excuse for a record I have ever heard. Why this has ever been printed is a complete mystery to me. What I DO understand is why CTI immediately locked it away in some drawer in '69 when it was recorded.It almost sounds like an Aebersold record for rehearsing - there seems to be missing an instrument. Maybe it was just meant for checking the arrangements!?!!?It's even harder to justify it, considering it's release took place in '82, long after super records like ""Weekend in LA"" and ""Breezin'"".Don't get me wrong - George Benson is a great hero of mine, and I love his playing, but I think this is a complete waste of money so be warned. Ill give it one star however, because of the beautiful song ""Out of the Blue"", which by the way can be found on a great compilation CD by Verve.So all in all : Whichever period of George Bensons history you like: STAY AWAY from this one!"
3,"Says gallon, but you'll get a quart....","Description says gallon, but only recieved a quart. Money refeunded. Bought product elsewhere. This is one of those items where it's true performance (will my concrete overcoat stay bonded?) won't be known for years so really hard to rate immediately after purchase."
5,"A joyful DVD, especially recommended for lifting young spirits or showing at children's birthday bashes","Based on the popular ""Viva Pinata"" and ""Viva Pinata: Party Animals"" video games for the Xbox 360, Viva Pinata: Lights, Camera, Action! is a family-friendly DVD of colorful, candy-filled creatures on Pinata Island, a place where parties never end. Hudson, Fergy, Paulie, and Franklin are nonstop 'party animals', and their playful adventures are sure to excite and delight young viewers. The episodes include ""Franklin Can't Dance"", ""Les Saves the Day... Again"", ""Sick Day"", ""Lights, Camera, Action!"", ""Mad Mongo"", ""Hudson's Biggest Fan"", ""Mission Impinatable"", ""My Little Fergy"", ""The Great Gob Rush"", and ""Hero"". A joyful DVD, especially recommended for lifting young spirits or showing at children's birthday bashes."
1,1 year and 4 months later = Fail,"This drive worked great for me for a full year and 4 months. I had it networked to my airport extreme for wireless downloads/backups/movie viewing. Died on me last night.Fortunately, I had most of the critical data and mp3 purchases backed up on my computers, but this event has really challenged my view on external drives. If this type of failure is common, then I really have no desire for a 1TB drive or higher... at least not until solid state becomes an affordable reality."
1,Don't do it!!,"If I could give a negative review for this I would. The hard drive worked fine up until yesterday when I tried to access it, and couldn't find it in the list! I had no way of accessing the drive. I tried everything - from rebooting my computer, turning the drive on and off, changing usb ports, and plugging it into a wall socket. NOTHING worked! I started google-ing around and found that other people had the same problem, and there wasn't really a solution for it. I even tried calling tech support, but they didn't want to help me unless I paid them $40 since my warranty for the drive was up. Now my only option is to open that sucker up and to put it into a new enclosure. Hopefully that will work or else all my stuff is lost! :("
1,Buy another model.,"I purchased this in June of 2007. It worked very nicely for about 4 months. I had a computer problem that forced me to shut down my computer improperly. When I turned everything back on, I could not access the drive. I got a message saying the drive needed to be formatted. I had a technician access the drive and my files are still there. The master boot record is gone, however. I have to buy another drive to move them to and then format the drive and all should be fine. After I do this, I won't trust this drive again. I will only hook it up when I need to and not leave it plugged in all the time as I was doing. I have had the My Book Essential Edition 250GB for well over a year and have never had a single problem. It is on all the time (and was on when I had the computer problem that caused the 500GB drive problem with no errors to the 250GB drive). It is a very good product. I'd go with two of the 250GB My Books and stay away from the 500GB altogether."
4,excellent external hard drive,This is the third WD My Book drive that I've purchased and my experience with all three has been excellent. They're simple to install; economical to operate; quite attractive in design and appearance. If all you need is a USB 2.0 link to your computer the My Book Essential Edition is the way to go.
4,Great drive for the price,"The drive performs as expected and the price was great. It makes a good ""online archive"" of data from our server that doesn't need to consume RAID disk space."
3,WD 500 gb My Book external hard drives,"I bought this product twice -- once for my home PC and once for the local Museum's PC. I really like the Premium Edition that I bought for my home because of the ease of use, friendly back up software, and large storage capacity. So when I ordered the second WD500 gb My Book for the Museum, I discovered that it lacked the friendly back up software and I sent it back. The Essentials Edition does not include this back up software but the description of the product by the online retailer did not explain it. So be sure to purchase the Premium Edition and not the Essentials Edition if you wish to do back up easily."
5,Good value for price,"I needed storage, but not any real frills, so this was a great choice and delivered what I wanted at a reasonable price. The drive is quiet and reliable."
5,Delayed review,"6 yrs after buying it, here's my review.Bulky -- obviously. The smaller drives have gotten cheaper over the years.very good build quality. Have formatted this drive multiple times to FAT32, NTFS, to EXT2 to EXT3 to EXT4 and then back to FAT32.Gave away the drive to my parents who still use it with their desktop."
1,I cannot recommend this,I am obviously a sucker for punishment since I bought this drive twice. The first time the first drive failed it fell from the desk so I didn't hold that against the drive at all. The second time .... I still have no idea why it failed. I have to back up everything on this drive a second place somewhere else which then negates the reason I bought this drive in the first place. I no longer buy from Western Digital.
2,Died way too early,This item just didn't last. I even got a replacement and it died too. And I've usually liked WD products
1,garbage,have gone through 6 of these in 2 years. 2 still work all the others hae died taking critical data with them 2 with less than 6 months on them do not buy this. only rating 1 star because you cant say 0
1,Still not working,"This drive is recognized and appears to work on my PC running Windows XP. However, during a large copy or backup operation it always fails with an IO error. I recommend spending a bit more for better reliability. I bought an internal 500GB seagate drive and a cooler master external enclousure for about the same price and it works like a champ."
1,Garbage,"This drive is trash. My computer would not recognize this drive. It does recognize other drives, so I've ruled out any local machine issues. WD Tech Support is a joke,so keep shopping for a better drive."
2,They took the on/off switch off,I sent mine back becaue they took the on/off switch off. Why would i want to leave it running all the time? Will last longer if turn it off when not needed.
1,Dangerous - This Drive Deletes Data,"You put the data on there, you turn it off, you turn it on and poof- data all gone. It's magic, but not the kind of magic you ever want to see worked on your valuable data. I would strong recommend that you avoid this drive. You shouldn't have to lose important stuff the way I did. Sad but true, this product won't protect your files- it will destroy them."
2,Became a brick after 6 months,"This drive is the reason I won't put money into WD drives again. It may have been an enclosure issue, but WD refused to send a new power supply for testing when my drive just wouldn't mount after 6 months. Otherwise it worked fine, and was easy to use. But at the time it was fairly expensive and yet the least expensive available at this capacity. You might be able to pop it into another enclosure to save it, but then why not just buy one from a company with a better reputation for reliability and service?"
2,LASTED FOUR YEARS TO THE DAY!,"I bought this in August 2006 in the 250GB version. It died four years on the very same day on which I bought it. The green light comes on, but following an episode of clicking, my computer didn't recognize it any more. Fortunately, or unfortunately, I purchased three more units at around the same time, so I lost only the one drive, and 100GB of material which I backed up elsewhere, so far. DO NOT JUST BUY ONE, or better yet, buy none and depend upon something else for storage."
1,Buyer Beware!,"I wish I read the reviews before... With data you really want function over form!I generally don't make a habit of leaving reviews. However, I was so disappointed with this product that I was motivated to do this. In any case, look at the distribution of the reviews. On one side, a of people love it and give it 5 stars (113 at the time of this writing). *However*, a lot of people hate it (72 at the time of this writing). Well, add me to the latter. My WD MyBook crapped out after a few months (less than 4). I haven't contacted WD, I'm going to take it to a Memory Recovering place, and that'll be the end of it (along with my desire of buying future WD products). Don't say you weren't warned (73 people have taken the time to put it in writing, don't be #74).Cheers,-FZ"
1,Ticking Time Bomb,"I received this drive for Christmas. It lasted two and a half months of light use before failing inexplicably. Blinking front indicator light, but the drive won't spin up and no computer I connect it to will recognize it. The day before it worked fine. Tech support was unhelpful, and I'm loathe to exchange the unit for another from the manufacturer. The drive is sealed inside the plastic shell, making removal difficult. I would not use this drive for anything valuable, it's cheaply made and untrustworthy."
1,"worked once, now it won't start up","This piece of garbage worked only once. Now it won't even start up. No sound, no power. I tried it in another outlet, same thing. WD web site will make me return it to get a replacement. I won't ever buy another Western Digital product."
1,Failed after 8 months,"I feel like the luckiest person today (knock on wood). I purchased this drive about 8 months ago and had filled it about 80-90% over that time. I had backed the data up to other sources, but not consistently. Last week, I was reading reviews of other people that had bought this drive and figured I was pushing my luck so I backed the entire drive onto a second drive, just in case. This week...? The entire thing crashed and everything is gone. Computer won't even recognize it anymore. These drives seem to have some serious problems with them. I definitely wouldn't use them as a primary storage drive."
2,Great...at first.,I have now had 2 of these. And I thought I found the perfect solution for back up and one just to keep my MP3s on. And I was right. They pugged right in and just worked. Then the warranty expired and within a week of the expiration they both died. And there I was left out in the cold. Don't depend on these for more than temporary back up.
1,This product does not work stably as expected,"I bought this product and partitioned it in a Laptop (ThinkPad T41). It worked fine. And then I attached it to my desktop (Compaq Evo W6000). It worked fine for a while (5 minutes something), then the drives became inaccessible. Unplug and plug again. Got the same issue.It was returned because I really can not count on a product works this way because I have no idea if it will keep the data safely."
5,Very Good,"This is an amazing hard drive. transfers data very fast, reliable.But I notices one issue, since the hard drive is in NTFS format, you cannot copy more than 4GB file to it. I had to split it and then join it."
2,less than thrilled.,"I own two of these things and although so far they've been reliable, with no serious problems to speak of after several months of use - I have to say that both are in every way (mounting, copying, browsing) unbelievably, painfully SLOW."
1,worst reliability ever,"After one year of use this drive keeled over with a click of death.This is the most expensive drive out there, because first you have to pay for the drive, then for data recovery."
1,3rd and last WD drive ever,"This was my 3rd WD drive. First failed after 1 year becuse I plugged in my printer power cord into it. O.K. My falt, but the drive should have an internal fuze for power surges. The second only lasted 7 months and just stopped working for no reasion, I lost half my OIF pictures from my last deployment. They are gone, and gone for ever as the CD they were backed up on got lost in a box in my last move. The 3rd never worked out of the box at all. I will never buy WD ever again."
1,Absolute Junk!,"Product failed after 16 months of light use. Would have been about 1,000 man hours of work lost if I had not had a second backup drive. Would not recommend."
2,Reliability issues,"I liked the form and function of the WD My Book external drive so I had four 500GB drives around in my home network. I used them to back up my home Windows XP computer that I use as a server and as Time Capsule hard drives for some of my Macs. Unfortunately 2 of the 4 500 GB drives are dead, one after starting to make a clicking sound, the second after it was inadvertantly unplugged while accessing the hard drive. All external hard drives can fail, but I am only batting .500. One unit was 1.5 years old, the other was about 5 months old.I've had better success with my La Cie drives."
1,Unreliable,"Do NOT buy this drive. Western Digital My Book is unreliable. I've had two of these drives, and they both died after a few months of very light use. In both cases, the drive suddenly started making the infamous clicking sound of death, and all the data was lost."
4,It works,"Purchased this drive as a mirror backup for a same drive. Unlike the other drive, the front button on this one is not pushable. Otherwise it works fine."
2,DO NOT BUY THIS!!,"We loved it for the first few months...though at times it had difficulty being recognized or powering up when the computer was restarted. Before 11 months went by it died...the click of death (as another reviewer put it) is exactly right. And it comes on suddenly. Yesterday it was fine, today it's dead. We lost 500GB of information (we were only able to back up half of what was on it before it died). We thought we'd at least have time to burn DVDs of everything and store the device as backup, turns out IT is the replaceable piece of hardware. Too expensive to be that so my suggestion is to just not buy one. My Seagate on the other hand is still trucking after 2 and a half years."
5,Excellent external drive for the money,"The price was right, and the drive so far has performed reliably. I reformatted it when it arrived and didn't install any of the bundled tools, and promptly transferred 400+ gigs of stuff over. It's quick and quiet, and the good ventilation on its case ensures that it never runs too hot for comfort.Would like to get another one of these so the one I already have won't be too lonely on my desktop."
2,Questionable reliability,"I purchased this hard drive to store and back-up music and video files. In the first 4 months, it worked fine but copying larger files was very slooow. One day after 4 months, I started the computer and got a message that the hard drive needed to be reformated. After working with tech support, I needed to reformat the drive, losing all the files stored there. The files were ""recoverable"" but at an additional cost. NOT TRUSTWORTHY!"
5,I'm Very Pleased,"I got it, plugged it in, and without any wait, I started saving my data from my overloaded pc into this external hard drive without any problems. It runs cooler than most other external hard drives, and I can hardly hear it working. It must be reformatted to NTFS in order to take advantage of its large capacity, and that is no problem, either."
3,Too Many bad sectors,"Received quickly, but it continued to power itself off. Western Digital Diagnostics showed it was experiencing too many bad sectors. WD has an easy warranty policy, and a new unit is on it's way now."
4,WD My Book 500 GB USB Hard Drive,"This device is easy to use with Windows XP. It's great for storing lots of data like video files. Just plug it in, and its ready. Unplug it and take it with you."
1,Don't buy this drive!!!,"I bought this drive a little over a year ago and loaded every single digital photo of my life as well as over 3000 mp3s and videos of my kids...and then one of my kids knocked over the drive while it was running. Just knocked it over, not down or across the room or anything. And now my computer won't recognize the drive and gives me the blue screen of death any time I try to turn on the drive. So I'm hoping and praying that the computer geeks down the road will be able to restore the data, but I am NEVER going to buy a WD drive again!!!"
3,Compatibility with Windows Vista64,"For me that wanted an External disk to work with this OS it has been worthless. But if that's not your case, you may buy it. Regarding otheraspects is a good hardware."
1,Failed in 3 days,I didn't even get a chance to use it.This is my second drive in a month.The first drive (dual interface) failed in a week.What's wrong with Western Digital?
1,"just clicks, does not function","used this drive for a while, now it just clicks when turned on, go find some forums, cause LOTS of these drives do this and then they r junk and you will spend $100's getting your data back"
1,Died During Its Second Year,"I have over 10,000 mp3 files (which were already backed up) on the unit. One day, I used Explorer to search for a mp3 by title, and the drive hangs up and the Explorer just gives me a slow progress bar. I click around and the drive gets itself lost. I rebooted and it was fine...until I tried a search. Same thing. The drive hangs up. I can't access the drive. I can't turn it off and on again unless I reboot the computer.I rebooted, and transferred all of my unbacked-up files to another external drive (Seagate) which worked fine as I was using that drive for storing files I don't often use as well as some backups.Fortunately, it was still working enough to save everything before I decided to make it into a permanent doorstop.I'm buying another brand. No more Western Digital."
1,"Started off well, then died.","I had this hard drive for about a year in a half. It had pretty much all my stuff on it. Sadly I didn't back most of my stuff up, and next thing you know, it died. It started making 3 clicking noises, then 3 more clicking noises. It would be recognized by my computer but basically the drive couldn't be read. I'm not sure if the data is still there but I would have to pay $1700 to send it out to drive savers which is not worth the money as of right now.When this drive worked for me, it was really good, but I have to give it 1 star because of how quickly it failed after buying it.Moral of the story, only buy this if you plan on rarely using it for backups and other things, because this drive WILL fail in a certain amount of time."
1,HIGH rate of failure.,"This drive failed on me and I lost all my data -- TWICE. One time was after perhaps 2 months. A second time after about 9 months. It is incredibly frustrating, DO NOT BUY THIS DRIVE unless you are willing risk data loss."
5,"LOVE IT, LOVE IT, LOVE IT!!!!","I've had this hard drive for 5 months now, everything is perfect, works like a charm! Super easy to setup as well :)"
1,Wish I would have read the reviews,"Just like everyone says, its a peice of junk. My computer dosnt register it half the time and it constintly freezes up. My father has one to and his dosnt work either and my colleges tech guy has had to fix it to get it to work more than 3 times. I cant count how many times Ive lost all my work. Its like I have to buy a secound one to just back up my back up. Dont waste your money please, be smart and go buy something thats not a WD. For what your spending go out and actually read into your product, I didnt and I regret it."
2,"Slow, noisy and worrisome.","I have had two WD 'caviar' drives fail with normal usage. they were back-up drives but still they lost things that couldn't be recovered. To be fair, this is NOT a caviar, which is why i decided to try one, but lately as it seems to be slower and more noisy, I'm getting very worried that it could follow down the same WD path. I'm going to perhaps buy a Seagate Barracuda and compare rather than put my unearned trust here."
1,"Not reliable, do not trust WD","The ""My Book"" drive I bought died in 8 months. I've been in the field for over 15 years and that is only the 3rd time I've had a drive quit on me. The big difference is the other drives that went bad were over five years old. I still can't believe how unreliable WD drives are. I have an external Lacie drive that has been running 24/7 for the past two years and is still doing fine.If you value your data, do not trust WD drives. Yes, they're inexpensive, but your time and frustration is worth paying a bit more for a more reliable brand."
1,Never Fails to Fail,All these drives seem to eventually fail. For the money I saved no I have to pay for data recovery.
1,Works great until it dies,I have two of the 750 gB versions. All of the sudden accessing my files is extremely slow. In a panic I transfered my files off the first one and thought I was safe. Now my 2nd one is doing the same thing.
4,Great Product for a Great Price!,"This hard drive is fast, reliable, and it wasn't too expensive! Engineering-wise, it is a little tipsy, but so far so good!"
4,Meet the Expectation,"I got this 4 weeks before and it was easy to setup. Just hooked it up via USB, formatted it to NTFS and it works.I would have rated it 5 stars if it has security or password protection features and I would make two partitions. I tried looking for softwares which could protect my external harddisk from access."
1,HDD crashed after two months,"WD is a well-regarded brand and they will be shipping me a new drive, but after the thing crashed on me after only a couple of months, I will no longer trust my data to WD. I have had Maxtor and Seagate drives (generally much cheaper) that have been running for years."
1,Death....,I have had 2TBs worth of these 500gb drives die on me. i have lost sooooo much files its not even funny. I have one left and i am orderign drives from other brands and backing up everything like i am somekinds squirel or something. These drives have just over 1yr lifespan if your lucky. And theres no warnign sign. they just die...
1,WD doesn't work for long,I had the WD for about a month then all of a sudden my home and laptop computers no longer recognizes it as a drive. I have tried many tech supports and all say I am screwed and my data is lost. WD will replace it though...cool to bad I had 300gb of info on it right!
3,Has software on it that permanently links to files on your computer.,"This is a good product for doing what it is supposed to do, provide a lot of added file storage space. However, some software which is resident on it, links itself to the files which you copy from your hard drive. If you make changes to one set of files (either on it or on your Computer's hard drive), it makes the equivalent changes on the other and vice - versa. I am still trying to figure out how to avoid this."
4,Works great!,"No complaints with this product. Amazon prime is great for the 2-day shipping alone. Timely delivery by Amazon. Plug and play....because I'm using it with a Mac, not sure how it works on a PC machine."
1,problems galore,I purchased this unit to archive ultrasounds downloads through an office based network. Because of the save feature of this device which turns it off between images the down loads were slow choppy and unreliable. I essentially have a unit I have had no sucess with and will look to return it.
5,My Book 500 GB drive is great!,"Compared to previous external hard drives I have used, this drive is quieter, runs cooler, and is cheaper per GB of space. I really like the form factor, and the drive comes up quickly on new machines using the USB2 connection.I have now bought 2 of them and I will probably buy a 3rd because I like them so much."
1,BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE,"The rubber gasket cording, whatever it is called, which surrounds the perimeter of this product totally came off. The case came apart. It still works, but obviously this is not good.I called western digital and they will not stand behind the product. they will not replace the drive.I bought it 2 months ago. I always buy LaCie drives and decided to try this - bad decision it appears. Furthermore the customer service representative could barely speak English leading me to think perhaps I was really talking to someone in another country?? Whenever I have had an issue with a LaCie product, whose call center is located in the US - they stand behind it 100%, no questions asked. I rate this one star, because they do not stand behind the product and have bad customer service."
1,remote access is very slow; access problems,"I purchased this drive so my family could share photos on a single drive that was accessible through the internet. While access is adequate from home, it is extremely slow for others so no one uses it. I have also had problems with accessing the drive. When I try to sign on, it says the drive is offline. It took more than a week to receive help from WD and they were unable to solve the problem. They referred me to the software vendor - I was never able to reach them. For some reason, running Registry Mechanic fixed this problem. I regret not having returned this drive during the 30 day period because now it just sits there unused."
5,"Great value, ease of use","I was looking for a good, reliable external HDD basically to archive media files. I'd rigged up some home-cooked external drives using old drives and drive enclosures, but the reliability had been spotty. The price was a main factor with the My Book 500 GB; it was actually cheaper than some internal drives of the same size.Pros: The unit is elegant, relatively quiet and non-intrusive. You can leave it plugged in at all times- it powers up and down with your PC, meaning this is an external HD you can actually use like an internal drive.Cons: It gets a bit warm, and sometimes seems to spin up for no reason.Bottom line: A terrific storage option. It looks good, performs well, and is reliable. I have NEVER had a problem with WD, and have owned literally dozens of their drives."
5,Wow.,"It's a hard drive. It holds things. Though not physical objects, i.e. don't try to use it as a coaster or a coffee table.Oh, and it looks like something out of Star Trek."
2,Died after a year.,"Like some of the reviews. I was very happy until last night when I tried to access the hard drive. I received the error, that it was not formatted and needed to be so. I have over 450gb of files, pictures, and home movies that I think are lost. I used it as a back up now the back up is fried. Please read all the reviews before you put your files, functionality, fate into this flounder."
1,Year and a half later-dead as a doornail,"Worked fine for approximately 18 months. Today it stopped working, emitted a little wisp of smoke, and passed on to electronic heaven. Not in a big hurry to buy from these people again."
2,Unreliable JUNK,"THAT SHOULD BE ONE STAR--AND IF POSSIBLE I WOULD GIVE IT NO STARS AT ALL. DO NOT BUY THIS DRIVE! I just experienced my second failure in just over 13 months. On the bright side, the return process was easy for the one that was still in warranty, but the data was still lost. As for the one that just went out of warranty and then failed... the data is lost AND I am out several hundred dollars. We hardly put these drives through any hard test. I own two. Both are connected via USB, as the firewire was a bit unreliable. They worked fine when they worked. All they did is sit stationary in a clean envinroment--and two of them ""broke."" Buy at own risk."
1,"If you buy this, back up your data on seperate drive!","Very high failure rate. Don't look at the 5 star reviews, if it were last week I would have given it 5 stars also. I've just lost 175 gig of music. Most of it is from my own collection but about 20 percent were purchased downloads. Western Digitals' only solution should be make sure you buy a second one as a back up source."
4,good product with a single shortcoming,"The only issue with this drive is the lack of ability to power down when not in use. Disk spins constantly as long as it is on line, no ability to 'sleep'January, 2010 - you guessed it - the electronics in the enclosure died. I was able to remove enclosure and plug the drive into a SATA controller to recover my data. DON'T TRUST ANY USB DRIVE FOR YOUR ONLY COPY."
1,A piece of waste,"This product is so unreliable, it stopped working after a few months. I spent more time to clean it up. Not to mention the data loss. Please do not buy this product, or you will regret!"
1,"Do Not Buy. Faulty Product, Stops working on slightest bump!","I purchased this drive after reading good reviews on it, and used it to store most of my media files which my harddrive could no longer hold. Worst Idea Ever. After simply being knocked over onto its side on my desk, the product has stopped being recognized by my computer and it appears I have lost all my media files. Definitely not worth it, and I would recommend not storing your files on it. It is not a safe hard drive."
2,WD drive crashed after 1 year,"After 1 year it suddenly crashed, I cannot recover any data. I have the ""500 GB WD Book"" on top of my desk, I've never traveled with it or hit the device. When it failed I tried CHKDSK /R and many other ways to bring it back.I lost about 350 Gigabytes of valuable data/applications/videos/music.Do not trust this piece of .... equipment."
1,"Horrible product, horrible support","Put data in. Never get it back. I emailed customer support 4 times with no response. Finally had to call and sit on hold for a half an hour. They couldn't fix it so I have to send it in and get a new one. What about the files? Gone forever. They had no response to me losing my files, other than ""sorry"". This thing is the most expensive ""recycle bin"" I have ever bought. Do yourself a favor and just hit delete, because it is the same thing this product does."
2,Harddrive stopped working,I bought 2 of these harddrives. and in 2 weeks one stopped working. I am very fustrated about this since i am an international buyer and its a hasle to sent it back to the US. Now i am worried that the other one will stop soon. Is something wrong with this product. I will never buy one more. Some of my friends wanted one ... i tell them dont buy it.
1,Rip-off,"Misleading description of product. Wrong picture (fiber)? I saw others listed as ""30-count (6 boxes) for under $22.00."" I really thought I would be getting more than one box for $14.00. I thought wrong. This is why I feel like I got ripped-off. The Splenda Store has these for $3.95 a box."
5,Night STalks the Gray House,"I found this book at a yard sale. I had never heard of the author but the title and cover intrigued me. I took it home and read it with enthusiasm. It's a good story. I loved the charactes. They were so human, I found that I could relate to them and let them drag me along as the story unfolded. It's good."
4,Night Stalks the Gray House,A friend of mine gave me this book and I found that I couldn't put it down. I really enjoyed it. The suspense kept me hanging on to the end.
4,Night Stalks the Gray House,I love to read books about ordinary everyday people dealing with ordinary everyday problems. This book fits that catagory. It doesn't have high-tech creations in it only good characters and a good murder mystery.
4,Night Stalks the Gray House,This book had a bitter reality to it that grasped me from the first moment. The characters are harsh and mirror reality. It is well written.
4,Night Stalks the Gray House,I read this book and found myself hooked from the first page to the last. I really liked the supernatural overtones that carry through the book. I think this writer has a real future.
3,personal am.fm cassette player,"this was given as a gift to my daughter who has a lot of cassettes. she has not commented to me on this product. I assume it is fine, or she would have complained!"
3,A could of been a lot better,This is by no means a must see comedy. There are a lot of better movies out there that make this seem point less to watch.The reason i give this 3 stars is that it will keep you watching till the end. I dont recommend this as a movie to buy but maybe to rent if your bored enough.As i was watching this i was waiting for the movie to hit a stride and become funny as i thought everything happening on the screen must become something. It never happened. The movie has a decent enough story line to keep you watching to the end but not enough laughs to be taken seriously as a comedy.
1,"Ignorant, Pointless, Lacking in Credibility, Drama or Humor","There are very few movies in which I'm unable to find anything worthwhile, but this one qualifies. The Big Empty offers nothing worth bothering with. The storyline is completely lacking in cohesion or sense. There is nothing to explain the point of the blue suitcase, or why anyone would be willing to pay $27,000 to have it taken to California. Perhaps for that reason the acting was weak, the characters unbelievable, and the comedy suggested on the case the DVD came in was non-existent. The vague suggestion of something that at least one reviewer perceives as science fiction simply did not resonate with me. The best thing about the movie was the ending, and the worst thing about the ending was that it didn't come nearly soon enough. Sorry, but in my view, this one is a real bomb."
3,Royal Hawaiian adventure,"I ordered this movie because it was filmed at a old hotel in Baker, California. I love this old building (although it is now just a vacant hotel). The film was confusing and not really that good. But the scenes at the hotel were fun because we had been there. I wish the old place would come back to life like in the movie, however I don't hold much hope for that. It has a good cast. And I will probably watch it again, just to see the old girl in her heyday."
2,The Big Empty remains fairly empty,"I kept waiting for this to fulfill it's promising start and the potential of it's very good cast, but it didn't happen. It's not as darkly funny as a Coen Bros film or as oddly weird and unsettling as a Lynch film. It's reminiscent of both styles, but for me it just didn't come together. The actors are entertaining to watch and pros in giving the script their best effort, but ultimately it was a mildly amusing 90 minutes. A decent effort, but viewers can do better."
2,Too unoriginal and derivative for my taste...,"Quirky films are something I love! I am an avid fan of both David Lynch and the Coen Brothers. They are true greats. Unfortunately this film is derivative of both. I was all pumped up to talk about the 'stolen' ideas from these two masters when I read the reviews here. One review praised this film for the same reasons I don't care for it! I will not site my own examples. But another film this is derivative of is 'Very Bad Things', a fantastic dark comedy. Jon Favreau is in that one as well doing a much better acting job. It helps he had better material to work with of course. I'm glad I only paid $3.00 for this but on the other hand it was a waste of money.Think I will go watch Mulholland Drive again..."
3,DVD problems,"I have bought 5 different copies of this film, and none will play without pixelating/sound problems. I have a near-new major-name-brand player.Buyer beware."
1,Big disappointment,"This is 90 minutes of my life I will never get back. Drawn in by the great cast, I was soooo disappointed when this turned out to be a boring, inane, UFO flick. What possessed all these good actors to be in this movie is beyond me, although at least they got paid. If you must try it (like if you are obsessed with Sean Bean or Adam Beach) try to get it at the library, as I did, and skip to the parts with your favorite actor. At least then you won't be out any money or an evening's time. This movie isn't even worth paying a rental fee to see."
1,Unwatchably dull,"I couldn't finish this movie, it was so boring. I guess if you are a Sean Bean fan, you must like this film. I'm glad those other reviewers got something out of this."
5,A great usb wireless b/g adapter-buy it-terrific C.S. support!!!,"After a negative experience with a previous purchase with a GSI wireless adapter,which was substandard. Amazon was wonderful with standing behind the product. I was given the opportunity to purchase this ZyXel G202 wireless adapter, which was an extremely install. I called C.S. and had a live body in the U.S. who was great. I have years of computer experience, but anyone can install this one with the help of C.S. directives and the easy read instructions and CD. The adapter was WEP and MAC encrypted with security settings of my choice, it can also be wpa and wpa2 encrypted. Works well with xp, vista and has a great signal. It appears to be very stable and solid. This product also can be used for a desktop and comes with a neat weighted base. I recommend this product to anyone who wants a good solid product. Works well with Verizon dsl products and many more."
4,ZyXEL Wireless Adepter,I like the ability to place the adapter in a place that receives less interference in comunicating with the router.
2,Drops connection frequently,"I have an HP Pavillion dv6000 laptop running XP with SP3. The computer is docked about 6 feet from the Linksys wireless router and I get 85% signal strength. The problem is that the ZyXEL adapter drops the connection with the router several times a day. It's pretty maddening, especially since I am pretty tech savvy and I have not been able to stop this."
3,Weak signal,"The design is good. The base offers flexibility. However, the signal is weak. I placed the router 2 walls away, the signal became very low."
2,I'll keep looking,"I'm glad to see that this adapter is working really well for everyone but me. I get absolutely terrible throughput and it constantly, and I mean constantly, drops the connection. None of the other wireless appliances in my apartment have any trouble connecting to the network and I get good speed on them. It's faster to walk down the street to the internet cafe to check my email than it is to wait for this adapter to bring it up."
4,Good connectivity,Works. Literally easier to use than to open the package. You will need the CD for some computers but for the most part it should just work. Unobtrusive. I've gotten 2.
5,Think you know Joyce? Read on!,"""Shakespeare and Joyce"" will open your eyes! Did you know that ""riverrun"" is the first Shakespeare reference in ""Finnegans Wake""? You'll know this and hundreds of other choyce titbits after reading this excellent, fun, and well-written book on the author who most impressed Joyce (Dante was second to the Englishman)."
5,Necessary.,"This text is a necessary addition to any student of the Joyce industry. This work not only is essential to those students interested in Late Joyce, but also those who are interested in the development of Shakespearian themes in the earlier works of James Joyce. This work aided me immensely in my Finnegans Wake term paper."
3,Economical Futon,"I purchased this for one of my children. While the futon pad is heavy, and of excellent quality, I can't say that the wood frame is. It's been a struggle to keep it together since we purchased it. I have reinforced the frame with screws and it seems to be holding together okay for now. This futon is very low to the floor; I would not recommend it for adults. I do like the way it folds up into a ""chair"" to keep from taking up too much floor space when not in use."
2,Much assembly required,"At least there weren't too many knots. The pine boards were lightly sanded and unfinished, which was OK for me because I love staining wood. (I used pre-stain, then several coats of red mahogany, then polyurethane satin finish.) The parts went together reasonably well, but substituting drywall screws for wood screws is really cheapskate.Update: I've finished assembling the second unit. It had a few rather obvious splinters along some of the boards."
4,"Nice Futon, Worthwhile!","I purchased this futon some time ago. It arrived quickly, and was packaged well. It does require assembly, but comes with most of the tools needed to put it together. It does take a bit of time to assemble, but it isn't a difficult process.The wood used was sturdy and I loved the natural look. The mattress was also very nice, and I really like how this small futon can be folded into a chair. Very cute. Overall, this was a good purchase. Again, it requires patient assembly, but it isn't too difficult a task - - just time consuming."
4,Nice case for small home or workgroup server.,"Fairly well made. Documentation for backplane could be better. Fans are loud, don't buy this if that's going to be a problem. System with Core 2 Duo, 4 gigs of ram and 4) 500 gig hard drives is running cool though, that's worth the noise for me. SuperMicro motherboard went in absolutely without pain. Entire build went smoothly."
1,Nice but less than accurate flush trimming,"Two weeks old and it's going back. The router base setup is less than ideal. A mounted bit should be at 90 degrees to the base but it's off by a degree or two. If you're trimming 1/4"" to 3/8"" off the side of a hardwood facing this is less than ideal. The bits pilot bearing runs hard against the lower material leaving a mark and the edge of the facing requires substantial sanding after your done. Checked out a few others in the store and they have the same problem. Called P&C and they claim it should be 90 degrees. The offset base heats up from the vinyl belt in the housing making the unit warm to hold for long runs.The unit itself feels well made but adjusting the depth is a bother with the base lock loose the base is free to canter a 1/16 - 1/8 so you're always adjusting and then tightening, adjusting then tightening trying to get it just right.Disappointing."
2,not very good trimmer,"I have a PC heavy duty router and it is great, so i ordered their laminate trimmer. The chuck does not hold the bits very securly, and must be retightened every minute or so no matter how hard you torque on it. The bases are very difficult to change, requiring a tool and a couple of minutes. I would recomend looking at the other options available."
3,Model 7301 PC Router / 7311 Trimmer,I have one of these trimmers and would like to know how to set the depth adjustment for this particular model. For some reason there is no manual in my purchaseThanks Weldon
5,A Winner!,"I keep referring to this book because life is made of constant change. The author gives practical advice for going through change gracefully, gaining power as we go. She also gives examples from her own life to illustrate and inspire."
5,Great value for price,I wasn't expecting much given the price. One doesn't get much 14K gold for $18 these days. I was pleasantly surprised with the pendant's size and sturdiness. It looks nice on a fine box chain. Well worth the money.
5,Very elegant,"This charm looks just like it does in the picture. It's a nice size, and being filigree, has quite a bit of detail. I would recommend!"
2,Enough already,"I have been a faithful reader Ms. Haines, but this time, she did not come through. The main character of the books, Sarah Booth Delaney, has turned out to be too much of a slut. In love with a married man!!! Where is the true Southern Belle, don't kiss and tell?? By the time Sarah drops her panties, and she drops them all the time, the whole town knows about it. Does Sarah have everyone in town on speed-dial? A southern lady - Sarah is not! I don't believe I can struggle through another book."
5,Sarah Booth at it again,"Sarah Booth is at it again! This time she is hired to defend a man who is being charged in the murder of a blues club owner and player.She is quickly told by Scott that he doesn't want her help but being that she wasn't hired by him, she continues on the case, only to find herself falling for this man, yet having stronger feelings for the sherrif.The town of Zinnia is about to fall apart with all of the racial activities, but in the end everything comes back together and Sarah Booth is again left alone with no man.Like the other books, this one will leave you suspecting quite a few people of this murder to only be surprised at the end to who it actually was.Every book leads me to wanting Sarah Booth to fall in love with a certain man, but I just can't stop wanting her to be with the sherrif even though he is married, but not happily."
3,An alternative to radio......,"...not as nice as the last, but surely not to be a let down. When radio has gotten under your skin to the point where it itches like acne, here is an ecclitic mix of ""SOMETHING DIFFERENT"". Chocolate Soul grabs many different genres of music and created a nice gem for underground heads to vibe to. Delivering the best in underground hiphop, soul, alternative and electronica. This CD contains a few tracks I've already had from other CDs like Fertile Ground and Karen Bernod.nice purchase, nice musicoNe"
2,The Only Animal Collective That I Can't Listen To,"So I LOVE all of the Animal Collective releases - except this one.Obviously you can check it out on YT to find out if you like it.But I CAN'T put this one on. It's just annoying.My favorite Animal Collective album is Spirit They're Gone/Spirit They've Vanished - so since this was recorded right after that, I thought it would be at least Pleasant.I'm sort of OCD with bands that I love, and I STILL got rid of this one.I'm a bit of a completionist - and I have about 1000 cds in my collection.But this one just stunk up my Animal Collective section.And I make weird music myself, so it says a lot if I can't get into this one.Sorry if you don't agree."
3,Inside elbow,"Works as it should, snaps to the cord mate rails with no problem at all. I would recommend this product."
5,Great read,"The book makes more sense if you read the prequel about Miles' parents. However, I enjoyed the action, the emotional drama as well as space opera stuff. Bujold has created an interesting character. He gets into all sorts of crazy things and manages to extricate himself creatively all the time. Very fun book."
1,Bad Edition - don't buy,The book is great but the production qualities for this edition are terrible. It's printed on cheap pulp paper with a tacky binding. It this had cost me just a few dollars I would complain but at hardcover prices - no way.
3,Beware....,"This book was great, Until halfway through suddenly towards the end of ""The Mountins of Mourning"" 40 - 50 pages are missing. The stories are great but check before you buy, I don't know if this was a printing error or just my copy. Otherwise I love this series, an old friend informed me that I had to read these books ... Thank you Diana for introducing me to one of the greatest people, Miles Vorkosigan is fun and delightful character to read."
5,Tom really knows this business,"After having watched Tom speak on several occasions, I can say without reservation that he knows what he's talking about. The ideas he presents and teaches are valid to a business owner or salesperson in any field and at a company of any size. Highly recommended."
3,"Good history, average story","I enjoyed the story, but it wasn't the best thing I've read. The author did a first rate job with his research. I could hear and smell the cattle. I could seen the wagons and the trail westward.My real pet peeve, was that the story took place in 1843 and the back matter on the back cover began with the phrase, ""after the Civil War...""As a history student, that irritates me.I think if you want a quick read, this would fit the bill, but if you don't get around to it, I wouldn't say you're really missing out that much"
1,Not worth the money,"I have enjoyed a few of Ralph Compton's trail series books. This one I stopped reading at 34%. I waited for character development, surprises and action, but received little. Sorry, but that's the way I read it."
3,Indie Rock,"Just a tip. I flipped thorugh this in the book store asumming to see Indie-Rock, and i got Emo/Punk. If you are looking for something from Spoon, Okkervil River and the like, then do not pick this book up.Where does the auther get the idea that NOFX and Static Lullaby are indie-rock? Hmm. =/"
3,Mulching blade?,"If you read the title of this, you'd expect this to be purely a mulching blade. Well, it's not. It's the same all-in-one high-lift blade that comes on poulan mowers from the factory for bagging. I wanted to replace mine for the fact that it doesn't mulch well at all. Now I have two that don't mulch well. I guess I should have done more research. Take a look at ""Poulan Pro 21-Inch Eliminator Lawn Mower Blade #PP21001"" before buying."
3,An Ok Mower But I wouldn't buy it again,"This mower is a tank. Weighing in at almost 90 pounds it is an SUV among push mowers. You can even engage the front wheel drive and just hang on.When it runs, it runs great.However, the Briggs and Stratton engine is famous for having oil problems and I really hate it. It went low and had troubles so I added oil. Then it had too much oil and clogged the engine and took weeks to clean itself out. I hit a low stump and the blade bent at an amazing angle because of the power of the mower. And I have yet to figure out how to raise the handle to be comfortable to anyone over 5 feet tall. I am over 6 feet and have a rough time with this thing.If it wasn't so expensive I would toss it and buy another one. I hope to get it working right again and then it should be worth using until the next time it gives me trouble."
4,A mi hija le gustaron,"Excelente relacion precio-valor, compramos estos zapatos para el uso de deportes de mi hija de 5 anos de edad en el colegio, a mi hija le gusta la facilidad de quitar y poner por el cierre de velcro. Lo recomendamos en 100%."
1,it's not for meditation,"I bougth this item for learning of deeper tibetian meditation songs. Unfortunately, I played the cd and this was the sacred ceremonys that repeat itself. This cd is not good for meditation. Meditation music must relax your body, mind and your soul."
5,A must read for anyone considering emulating the Nearings,"Gives a much more realistic picture of the challenges and rewards of a self sufficient life off the land than The Good Life does, and clears up some of the details that were glazed over the The Good Life."
2,"OK, but not great","Maybe it's just my kids but I have had two of these---one for my 3 year old and one for my now 12 month old (both given to them when it was age appropriate)---and neither child was at all interested for more than a *few* fleeting seconds. I threw our first one out, but bought a second when my baby was born, thinking she might like it better than her brother---nope! And this is at the newborn age---there is no way at 10mos old they would have liked this (going by the age range given. Honestly there is not a lot for an infant to do with this. For me it was a waste of money both times, and if we have a third child, I would not buy another unless I actually see the baby enjoying it! If it works for everyone else I envy you all!"
3,"Great toy, poorly manufactured","This kept my 4 week old baby occupied for at least 10minutes so I thought it would definitely be a winner for when the baby was older. Unfortunately, the button on the arches ripped out on second day of use. Product quality is one star for me"
3,Fairly happy with this product...,"I have a 3 month old daughter and she loves this play gym. As a parent I do have a few complaints, but nothing that I consider a deal-breaker. I wish there were lights on the arches, not just on the mat itself. I've also had problems with the ""nursery tunes"" musical setting. I can't get it to play longer than 30 seconds or so. I don't have that problem with the ""Mozart"" setting for some reason. Regardless, she loves it."
4,Nice item to have.,My little girl loves this item. She kicks the mat with her feet and music starts. She kicks all the animals dangling. She loves to look at all the colors and overall enjoys the activity. Love it. Don't buy a whole lot of extras with it. It gets a little to much in the babies face if you do.
4,great activity gym,"My five month old son loves this activity gym. I love that you can move the different toys around so that he can play with them weather he is on his tummy or on his back. I love that it plays different nursery rhythms and that they are interactive. They only play again if the right spot on the mat is hit. My son loves the toys that crinkle, the parrot, and the elephant ear. He also greatly enjoys the plastic toy that came with it. It is his favorite now. The reasons it did not get a five star rating is that the toys hang too low. Even when the toys are at their highest point they are in my sons face. Other than that it is a great product and it stores very easily with the snaps."
4,So Cute!,"I like this product. Recived it today and the light thing was messed up. Called the company and they are sending me a replacement for free right away, so at least the problem will be fixed. it is very bright and colorful."
5,Lots of things to keep a baby entertained,"I did a lot of research right here on Amazon before purchasing an activity gym for my niece. I purchased this one and am very pleased with it for several reasons. First, it is VERY easy to put away. It can be collapsed easily (by an adult that is) and be stored behind a couch or under a bed. Second, there are all sorts of things to do. From hearing crinkly sounds, pulling on toys or finding just the right spot to hit for some tunes, this will keep a baby entertained for a good amount of time. It is relatively easy to clean and provides SOME padding. I did however prefer to use this over a carpet just to make the baby as comfy as possible."
5,twins love it,My twins love this play mat. They are 3 months old now and I have been using it since I brought them home from the hospital. It is big enough for both my girls to play on and the arches remove easily for tummy time. It also folds up very easily so you don't have to leave it out all the time (left it out one night and found my cat batting at the toys!). The music is a little repetitive but the music box is easy to remove. I've washed it a bunch on cold water and let it air dry and it still looks great. Would recommend!
4,One of my baby's favorite toys,My 3 months old baby has been spending at least two hours in this gym everyday. He loves the music and the colorful patterns. The only problem is that some of the animals are dangling in such a low position that they are almost in the baby's face.
5,Hours of fun!,"Our son loves this gym. We have used it to encourage head lifting, and to engage him with the different toys. He loves the elephant and the giraffe. The only negative is that the snap style buttons are hard to fasten, but I am sure they will loosen up with use. This gym also works well with lots of links so that you are able to incorporate any other toys you may already own. To those who have made complaints regarding the sound, it's a $50 toy not a Bose sound system. I feel that the musical selection is just fine, and the fact that the musical and light synchronization is great."
4,Very good,I purchased this product for my 3 month old baby and she simply loves it. Material is very nice and baby safe.
5,ONE OF THE BEST THINGS TO HAPPEN TO INFANTKIND,"As I am sending this to my friend for her baby, I just realized that I never wrote a review for this. My daughter is almost 11 months old now. she still plays with the hanging toys. my daughter loves every mirror she looks at. the first mirror she looked into came with this play gym. she kisses her reflection, loves different sounds the fabric makes. The music is wonderful too and used to calm her down when she was little. every bit of this gym is great. worth every penny."
5,PERFECT little product for all types of kids!,"The tiny gym is a great little gym for your child. It comes with so many different activities that you may not know where to begin, your child won't. This can only be a good thing because your little one will be entertained for quite a while, and smiles and giggles may be heard and seen. Suitable for those age 3 months to 1 year, it helps your child to develop and learn. This activity gym is very brightly colored and is full of carefully designed toys that he or she can grab. There's also a small mirror which your little one is sure to love and will keep them occupied for a while. The gym comes with a little music box and surprisingly the batteries are included, so you won't be disappointed when you get it home. The gym is easy to fold and store away and is a pleasure to have around the home."
3,Decent for 6 months old but not great,Nice decent product but not great. I think it is expensive for what it gives. Mirror quality is bad. I don't want my infant to see in this mirror. Music and light is also not that great. It is colorful though and my infant stares at those colors.
4,Keeps 4 1/2 month old busy,"My 4 1/2 month old has had lots of fun with this mat--so much so that my labrador wants to use it too. There are lots of details to explore.My only complaint is that I wish it had a little more padding. Now that the baby is rolling around a lot, it would be nice if there were more cushioning."
4,Keeps baby busy and having fun!,"I bought this because my baby hated her tummy time and I needed something to get her on the floor and happy. Well, this did the trick! She loves her gym and especially the hanging giraffe rattle (the feet are just perfect to shove in her mouth). This thing will keep her busy for about thirty minutes at a time and provides much needed time for mom to get some things done. My only complaint is that the colors have faded on the mat and are not nearly as bright any more. In the mat's defense, my baby spits up a lot and it does get washed a few times a week."
2,Flashing light short lived,"I purchased this gym because it seemed to have a larger mat and more activities than the Baby Einstein Play Gym. On its maiden voyage, the green flower's light quit working. I changed the batteries, but this didn't help. It had been on for less than 5 minutes. Also, I didn't have it on long enough to complete the ""10 minutes of classical music"", but I believe it only plays one Mozart song, which seems to be very repetitive."
4,5 Month Old Loves the Gymini,Great product. My grandson loves it. My only complaint is that speakers are on the bottom of the mat and are somewhat muffled by the carpet; the sounds could be louder.
5,Erik loves Tiny Love Gym,Baby Erik is 6 weeks old and he loves the music and looks at all the great hanging toys he will soon be grabbing for them. Great color and design and easy to fold and store great new baby gift.
1,choking hazzard,"When we first purchased the gymini we loved it, and so did our baby girl.That changed today. The purple elephant is a danger to all children. The shiny pink plastic on the bottom of the elephant can come off when put into infants' mouth! My daughter was sucking on the elephant and began vigorously choking.I'm sure this is not the first time this has happened. And if consumers continue to purchase this toy before this problem is rectified, it will surley not be the last!"
4,This will do,"I was looking for a baby gym that was affordable, yet not hazardous or too cheap looking. I like that this mat has so many things for the baby to play with. I wonder how long it will take for her to find everything on it! I'm happy that this folds up so that it can stay out of the way when not being used, it travels easily, and I can keep dust off of it. I personally don't really care for all of the bright colors but it's not for me to play with anyway. I'm sure my baby girl will love this when she gets here. The price is right!"
3,It is okay.,It is an okay product.. Animals seem easier to grab for my son. It is a pretty simple product comparing to other fancy gyms but works just fine.
2,Defective Gym,"I have purchased the above item via Amazon on 17 August for my 2 month old which was shipped to a hotel which my husband was putting up during his business trip. Unfortunately, when we test the gym upon his return to our home country, we noted two serious defects:1. The big mirror was not reflective at all with it's surface appearing like a permanently frosted mirror.2. Faulty sound/lights pad. The sound and lights did not function properly. One of the three flowers is not lighted at all and the music does not start sometimes.We are very disappointed with the defects since we have read fantastic reviews about it on Amazon and have been loyal fans of Tiny Love products.As my husband is already back in our home country, we are not able to do an exchange or return with Amazon. Our efforts to contact the local importer of Tiny Love were in vain. It is very disappointing that there is no quality check on its products prior to shipping to its customers."
3,Music feature broke,My son (now 4 months old) loves this playmat. It washes easily. My only complaint is that the music broke a few weeks after we bought it -- it still plays but the sound quality has worsened to the point that it sounds off key.
5,Great toy!,"We purchased this for my daughter when she was only 2 months old. She loves it more and more the older she gets (now at 4 months). She would never leave the playmat if it were up to her. The dangling toys are so fun, she ""talks"" to them constantly. The little kick pad is great, she makes it go off when she gets really excited. We use this mat primarily for her playing while laying on her back. She does not really like ""tummytime"" so it has not really served much in that way, but overall this is a great toy for a young infant."
5,Great toy for baby Vin,"When I opened up this toy at my baby shower, I thought, we'll be giving this toy up soon enough, but I was surely wrong.My son just turned 3 months and honestly, I can say that this toy has really changed his personality. He's always laughed and smiled but this play mat has really brighten up his coordination, his reactions and also his attention span. He is so focused on the colors of the toys, attempting to grab his toys, his listening skills are enhanced, what more can I say, this is a back to work mom's dream. I can finally finish home chores without getting distracted by my son's whining. A must buy! The only thing I dislike, volume of toy is too low, other than that, great gift and awesome toy!"
4,My son loves this playmat!!,"My husband picked this out and I have to say, it was a good buy. I was skeptical about it and thought that it might over-stimulate our son, but it hasn't. He loves the hanging animals and the mirror. He kicks the bird, pulls on the monkey's legs, and now, I cannot go anywhere without bringing the little giraffe with us. When he discovered his voice, he started to ""talk"" to himself in the mirror and ""talk"" to his little hanging ""friends""... I hope this is helpful!!"
3,I thought this was great my daughter thinks otherwise,"I liked this activity mat out of all of them, with all of the great things to do and see. Unfortunately, my 5 month old daughter wants nothing to do with it. I find myself on the floor having more fun with it than she does."
4,baby loves it,"great idea. our baby loves it. music isn't very loud, but hanging toys are great. Had the one for daycare and a different one for home. Both great, see my other reviews."
4,good,My bought this one when my daughter was 3m. She can play on the mat more than 30min. She loves the monkey. This Gym is very good. Everything is cute. However I donot like the mirror. My daughter never use it.
4,Great Mat to grow with baby,"TI have gotten a few play gym mats and this is by far the best. The arches are low enough that even little grabbers can reach the toys. The toys do come off fairly easily once baby is old enough to understand the concept. The mat itself is larger than many and has additional toys like the crinkle, music & lights.I don't give this 5 stars because the crinkle ear (which my son loves) got all messed up when washing so is disappointing now. And the music stinks. It's too short and too repetitive."
5,Great activity playcenter,This is a great product. Lots of stimulation for the baby at different stages of development. I love the fact that it folds up and is very portable.
5,loads of fun!,My little 4 month old grandaughter absolutely loves this! It entertains and stimulates her for long periods of time. A must for new parents..you won't regret this purchase for sure!
4,Great washable mat,"This mat entertained my baby from 2 months to 4 months, then she was bored with it. The music is not annoying. The mat is machine washable and the colors stay vibrant. It is tacky with all the colors but my baby loved it and I think it is more stimulating then the monotone designer mats with tasteful but boring toys."
5,Love the tiny love gym,Our 6 week old is just starting to really love his tiny love gym. We've had it for a few weeks but now he's starting to really enjoy it. It's made tummy time fun for him and I'm sure we'll get a lot of use out of it!
5,Movement to Mozart,"I purchased this product for my twin grandsons. They love it! They enjoy kicking against and hitting the animals, are mystified when they make the horn honk, and are attentive to the music, especially the Mozart. They enjoy ""face time"" in the mirror. A great product recommended to me by another daughter, who also has it and whose little son also loves it. Also important is that it's easy to ""assemble"" and a breeze to take down and store!"
4,I liked it more than my baby did,"By all means, this mat has everything; it just wasn't for us. It is colorful, spacious, and has plenty of neat things to keep a baby entertained. The mirror, hanging toys, music, and all of the activities on the mat seem to make this the best mat on the market. My daughter, however, never seemed impressed by it. I put her on it almost daily for some time when she was very young, and I even showed her its cool features, but she just never got into it and before I knew it she had outgrown it and it was being packed away. I will suggest that you not buy this mat if you have dogs in the house. My yorkie was always trying to nap on this thing, and he was constantly going after the hanging toys. I thought I could lay it inside a playpen instead, but it was too large to fit inside. It's a great mat, but I could have saved money just using a blanket."
3,Not worth the money,"The obvious problem with this toy is that it's $60 and is only suitable for 6 months. The Gymini concept is great, but I'd go for a cheaper, more bare-bones version. A baby under 6 months won't be offended.My problems with this item: The toys hang too low and ""in-your-face"" - my son found this upsetting. The music is repetetive and annoying. We're not talking Mozart's greatest hits, but one part of one piece played over and over and over again. The nursery rhyme music is only slightly less annoying. The colors are fun for us, but for babies that young, they're not really necessary. We had a black-white-red version (a hand-me-down) that captured my son's interest much more, and didn't cause him to cry from overstimulation and overcrowding. I'd stick with that one instead."
5,Great for entertainment!,My twin daughters love this gym. They can either be on their backs and bat at the hanging animals or they can lay on their bellies and watch the lights blink in the flowers. The music is great and they both love it. I also like the fact that you can detach the hanging animals and move them around. I recommend this gym for all parents.
3,Not Bad,I like the colors and the toys very cute. However...I should've known better since my baby likes to be active. She hates laying on this thing. She prefers her Fisher-Price Rainforest Jumper. Overall though this product is ok.
5,Baby Loves It!,"I am so pleased with this play gym! It is so very cute. I love that it is 3-D and that the elephant ear lifts up and is crinkly and has a bird hiding under it. The flower petals will be great for grabbing. (My little guy is just 2 months, so isn't doing that yet) I also like the fact that there are places to attach toys at different levels, so we can move the toys and our son around under them and keep it interesting. Our son loves it and just grins and coos at the hanging toys. I haven't put batteries in it yet, so cannot comment on the music feature. I am so happy we purchased this one!"
4,Daughter loves it..,My 2 month old loves it..she can spend hours on this entertaining herself. The lights and music have become kind of old though - wish there were more options for the music.
4,likes it!,my two month old really seems to enjoy the play gym... the crinkle parrot and mirror and elephant ears are the best!! Goes great with the fish kick wind chimes!
5,Baby girl loves this,"It's easy to carry, easy to clean, and my daughter loves it. Each of the toys come off and are fun individually as well."
4,Liked it ...but pricey....!,"No assembly at all...which was a nice surprise! I like this alot & so does our 3 month old but I think $60 is alot of money for this playgym. It does have some nice features likes cute hanging animals, the floor mat is very colorful with lots of little pop up things & plays mozart music. The classical mozart music lasts about 10 mins & is very soothing. It does have nursery rhymes music, too, but it only lasts a few seconds (which is a waste...why even have it?) I thought it would come with more hanging animals, which was a little disappointing. You have the option of buying more accessories for this. For a $60 ""super deluxe"" playgym, all the accessories should be included!!"
2,I wish I hadn't...,"I was totally set on purchasing this product before my son was born. It is so adorable and I could just picture him laying there and playing with the different things on the mat. Well, was I in for a surprise. My son could not have cared less about this thing. He much rather preferred laying on a blanket with a boppy pillow and placing some interesting toys in front of him. Oh well, live and learn - but a pricey one at that!I can say the only thing my son enjoyed (and still enjoys) about this thing is the little giraffe rattle that comes with it. He loves that thing. But jeez - what an expensive rattle!"
5,"Costs a little more than most mats, but worth it!!!","I ordered this a few weeks ago and we've used it at least twice every single day since it arrived. My baby is now 9 weeks old and loves it. His favorite toy by far is the monkey. I detach it and take it everywhere with us now and he always smiles at it and talks to it. I wish I could just buy an extra monkey toy separately! The Mozart music is great, but the nursery rhyme tunes are really short and don't sound as nice. I also ordered the chimes which are also great. My baby is a real ""kicker"" and he'll go non-stop on the chimes for an hour. I'm sure this toy will last a lot longer since there's so much on it he hasn't discovered yet. At a freind's house, I just saw the Deluxe Symphony Mobile from Tiny Love with similar looking animals that I'm going to order soon."
4,"feature-rich, but a little flimsy music box.","I got it for my 2 mo old son, since i thought he was starting to get bored with the musical mobile on top of his crib. I guess he is still too young, but he didn't reach out to grab the hanging toys. He did, however, enjoy the classical music that plays for 10 long minutes. Now at 3 mo, he likes the mirror hanging at the corner of the gym, but still doesn't care much for the hanging stuff.About the only gripe i have is the flimsiness of the music box. After accidentally stepping on it, the music began to sound ""funny"" and ""synthetic"". After changing the batteries, however, the problem went away. By the way, the batteries don't last very long. I play only about 2 times (20 minutes) a day, and 3 AA batteries only lasted 1.5 week. also, when the batteries go low, the music again start to sound funny and slow.."
5,Can't live without it!,"This item is a must have. Our baby has been playing with this since a month old. He is now 4 months old and still gets as much delight from it. Everyday he has to have playtime with his ""friends"" (the animals that come with it). The windchimes (sold separately) are a great addition, and he loves kicking them and hearing the sound. The mirror amazes him and he loves to stare at himself. And it folds up for easy travel. We take it anytime we'll be out for an extended period of time."
2,Item smells of petrol,"The gym is really cute but the whole item (particularly the mat) smells of petrol. May be from the packaging, but then they should use different packaging. Items must be SAFE for babies! Description said that there are sample batteries in it, but there are not and the battery case is extremely hard to open--near impossible."
1,Crapped Out,"All of a sudden, after three months of fairly steady use, the music and lights just stopped working. We replaced the batteries twice, but soon realized that was not the problem. It's a shame because I would've gotten a cheaper mat which may have lasted longer, had it not been for the great reviews on this crapper. Our daughter is now 4.5 months old and is about to the point that she cares whether there are lights and music..."
5,"Excellent ""Jungle"" Gym","I read through countless reviews of many different activity gyms before adding this product to my baby registry and I think it was an excellent choice.My baby loves this activity gym which we refer to as the Jungle Gym. We started using it around week 2 or week 3; we have watched weekly improvements in baby's coordination and strength as he plays on this mat, reaching for and batting at the cute, brightly colored jungle animals. The lights and mirror also capture his interest during tummy time.This product also folds up easily for travel so you can take it with you to grandma's. The mat takes AA batteries; with multiple uses of the mat's music & lights each day, the batteries lasted for almost 2 months before needing to be changed.I highly recomend this activity gym."
5,I enjoy watching my daughter play in this as much as she enjoys playing in it,"We received this playmat when my daughter was nearly 2 months old. She is now 4 months old and this keeps her attention longer than her swing or bouncy seat. She will lay and play with this for a good hour or more. It is a joy to watch how her development has grown with this. At first, she would just lay and stare up, then would occasionally bat at the animals, and now she grabs at them and holds on to them and laughs and laughs. It truly is a great developmental playmat. I chose this mat because it has a mirror, and that is definitely a must have feature for a play mat. She loves looking at herself in the mirror, and it really helps her during ""tummy time.""This is also very portable...fits well in a suitcase, the arch can be moved to the pack and play, and the mat is very soft.Our daughter entertains my husband and I as much as she entertains herself with this mat! A must-have in my opinion!"
5,Pleased....,"I needed an activity mat so I basically jumped on Amazon and bought the one with the most/best reviews. Just received today and so far very pleased. I LOVE how nice and flat and easy it folds up with all the toys still attached. Also happy that its machine washable. The toys seem very engaging and I like all the areas for tummy time, something my previous mat lacked. The only problem so far is keeping my toddler off it so my newborn can enjoy! :)"
3,good for a short time,"If you're going to buy this, I recommend that you get it when you're baby is a newborn because it's quite expensive for a product that is only for babies up to 10 months old. I bought it when my baby was 3 months and now at 4 months she's already bored with it. She's rolling over, so it's not entertaining her as much as it did before. I wish I had it for the first 3 months. I think it would've really helped out!"
5,#1 Baby Item,"THis is hands down the best item that we bought for our daughter. She fell in love with it (mainly the mirror) at a few weeks old and is now nearly 7 months and still loves it (though I've added some toys over time). If you buy one thing for your child, this is the one. My daughter hangs out in it all the time - first she'd look at the toys, then swat them, now she gets in there and handles everything, flips to look at the mat, etc. It's been such a huge help to me to have a few minutes to get things done or rest because she's so happy in there and it's good for her little body, too.Tiny Love is great and their products have been our favorites."
3,Good - but problems with music,"We bought this gym for our baby because we saw it at a friend's house and thought it was really cute. My son does seem to enjoy ""tummy time"" on the gym, and looks at the colorful mat in wonderment. The animal toys are very cute, although I think all of them hanging over him at once is a bit of overkill - luckily they are easily removable.My only complaint about this toy is that the music player doesn't work very well and is pretty flimsy. It has 2 settings - one that plays mozart and one that plays children's songs. The children's songs setting does not work at all, and the mozart sounds a bit warped, even with new batteries. This was a big disappointment for me as my son really seems to enjoy musical toys.If the rickety music player doesn't bother you, I hightly suggest this gym as the toys on it are very colorful and well-made. If your kid's like mine, though, and loves musical toys I'd either buy something else, or add your own musical toy to this gym."
4,"Nice, but the sound could be louder","My daughter enjoys this, but the musical sounds could be a lot louder."
3,mom of 2 boys and a baby girl,I loved this gym! I could not wait to put my daughter in it. She is now 2 1/2 months and she hates it! She is in it for about 30 sec before she starts crying. The toys hang down so low that they are touching her body and she hates it when it hangs in her face. I began thinking how is this product going to last untill she is 10 months old like the age says. If the toys touch her while laying down how is she going to push up on her arms or even sit up?? I returned this gym and bought a fisher price musical play garden and she loves it and it will last for a long time.
5,Our son loves it!,This is a great buy. Our son loved it from birth. The only downfall is that it is a bit pricey but aren't our kids worth it? :-)
3,Nice to Have,"This item quit working fairly quickly. My daughter didn't really care about this item for a while. Once she did start playing with it more, she grew out of it quickly. I would suggest getting a less expensive one. It is really easy to wash."
4,Still giving it a chance,"My 4 month old enjoys this pretty much. When he started rolling over at 3 months I decided to get something for him to play with also. Now he does not roll anymore. The only complaint I have is that I purchased this so he would enjoy tummy time more. Now he does not want to be on his tummy.A friend of mines 1 year old loves it, so I will give it more time. He will probably start to like it more later!"
3,"more, please","this one is alright. it can occupy my time for long enough, i guess. the colors are bright, which i really like. and it does make me laugh. i just wish it had more flashing lights. i love love love flashing lights!"
1,Depends On What kind of a baby is getting the toy...,"My little brother was always bored, so we went to the store and we bought him this. He didn't even touch it! He was probally 10 monthes at the time. He is more of an adventure baby. It might be because he lives with a very big family and is not delighted by little joys of life. He just wasn't interested! (It depends on the baby..)"
3,Activity Mat,When I got this as a gift I thought my baby would love it. We have tried introducing it to her several times each week since she was about 8 or 10 weeks old. She is 6 months old now and has never had much interest in it. The toys have always hung too low even when adjusted properly. It looks super cool but she is happier playing with an empty water bottle or plastic cup. I am hoping that our next baby will enjoy it more.
4,Fun,My baby definately likes this item. It is great how you can change the links and animals and also pack it up on the go.
4,"Great gym, but more than you need",I do love the gymini but I think the lights and music are overkill. We should have saved some money and gone with one of the less expensive versions. Our daughter loves to play with the hanging toys but she has no interest in the lights and music. After awhile it gets annoying since the music is activated anytime the baby kicks a certain spot on the mat (even when the music is turned off).
2,Disappointed,"I was disappointed in this mat, based on the fact that I was looking for something to encourage my 5 month old son in his tummy time. I thought the musical buttons on the mat would be great cause and effect fun, but they are hard to press. Sometimes he can make them work if he hits them with his heel, but then he has to be on his back which is not the point for tummy time! If you are looking for a gym for your baby when s/he is on their back, then this is a fine one to get. It folds up and snaps for easy storage. Unfortunately, ours is stored more than it is used!"
5,Good Quality and Safe,"I bought it as a present, I called my friend and she really liked it. She said that was a very good quality and safe entertaining toy."
2,Unsatisfied,"This was a replacement for the same product where the blinking lights on the flowers quit working very shortly after it was received. Unfortunately the same thing happened with the replacement item almost immediately. Altough Amazon waas good about replacing the first item, I don't think it is worth my time to ask for a second replacement."
5,Great!,"My dd is 5 months old. Every week, as she continues to develop, she discovers a new thing about activity gym that she loves and is enthralled with. She adores it and we love that it has continued to hold her interest as she grows!"
4,Sanai Enjoys This Toy,"My daughter Sanai who is 4 1/2 month old has been playing with this toy for two weeks. She enjoys the attachable toys. She loves to bite on all of them. We brought the rest of the toys and added them on, too. She plays for awhile talking and she especially love the mirror. I enjoy watching her as she plays with the Gymni. I have to take it with her when she goes to her Grandmother's house in the morning. Yes, I recommend this toy and you have to buy the rest of the toys."
4,Liked it!,"We received this in our baby shower. And probably started using it when the baby was about 3-4 months old. The hanging toys can seem over-whelming in the beginning. So I would suggest the parents hang just one or two or move them away from baby's face. The music & lights worked extremely well and we had to replace the batteries only once.The only issue I've had is that 2 of the hanging toys have plastic eyes (protruding kind). Once the kid gets a little older and starts putting things in his/her mouth, they might pose a hazard. So please supervise your kid's play at that age (6-9 months).Otherwise it is a great activity mat. Very colorful & engaging. My baby used it for play extensively. The mat itself has music & lights, squeaks & crackles in places. The hanging toys double as rattles. There's a mirror. And kids can play sitting up too. Would definitely recommend.4 stars is solely because of slight safety concern - wish all eyes on the animals were sewn on."
5,You need one of these!!,"i didn't know whether my baby would actually like this, but starting at about 2 mo she spends at least 1 hr a day playing happily by herself. this will revolutionize the time you spend with your infant!"
3,Disappointed,"I'm so sorry, but I must write a negative review for the packaging of this product. The price was $60 and the box came without any reinforcements, it was crushed and the tape was not totally adhered to the carton. Even the UPS man documented a damage delivery. As the present is for a baby shower I'm not sure of its quailty until its opened. I've bought many things from Amazon, but this is my first disappointment"
3,"not bad, but not great either","I was looking for something that would help my son to enjoy tummy time and encourage him learn to crawl. Unfortunately, this didn't do the trick.The music feature is fairly nice, with 2 settings and touch sensitivity, so the baby can activate it if he pushes the right area. There is also a little squeeky toy in the mat that the baby can find, if he's so inclined. The toys are cute, but they never really captured his attention.The mirror feature was a big selling point for me, as children his age are supposed to enjoy seeing their own reflection, but again, my son just wasn't interested.The bottom line is: He got bored very quickly when I put him down on this mat. It was alot of money to spend on something we never use."
3,Great but won't last long,"My daughter loves this playmat, but she stopped liking it once she got the Tummy-time gym which has music and interactive toys. So, I felt that it would have been cheaper to buy that toy instead, since it costs not even half as much!!"
3,Okay,It is not as great as everyone is making it out to be. The hanging toys bang the baby in the face when he hits them. They hang to low. Only one part of the mat lights up. Doesn't do enough for $60.
3,GREAT item - but buy it used!,"My son loves this activity mat! He's only 3 months old, but he loves batting at the animals and looking at himself in the mirror. I'm sure he'll continue to grow more interested in it as he gets older. I will add that I did not pay full price for this item - I bought it used for $15 because I couldn't fathom paying $60 for a piece of fabric that will only be used for 6 months. Be kind to Mother Earth - Reduce, Reuse, and Shop on Craigslist!"
1,"Contains fiberglass, causes rash","When my baby is on his back, he enjoys swatting at the toys... but when we do tummy time and his face comes in contact with the fabric, it causes a rash. I'm not sure if the rash has to do with the fiberglass batting (great idea for a baby product, huh?) or the cheap, rough fabric. Regardless, I would highly recommend looking for a similar product that doesn't contact fiberglass."
3,It was just not so entertaining,"I got this play gym on Amazon because of the high rating. And my son personally just not interested. When he was 4 months old, only the mirror caught his attention, he would stared it for mins, and the toys hanging there was just annoying. They bothered him, and he would rubbed his face. And when he reaches 4 and half months, he totally lost interest. He would cry when i place him down. and the mat is so thin when he tried to roll over, sometimes half way and bang his head on the mat/floor. That's how thin it is with no cushions. The Mozart tunes are really annoying, it would just kept on repeating it self again and again, and if you turned it to nursery, the music is really short, it last only a few seconds. not good for tummy time nor entertaining. So please think again before purchasing it."
4,Playmat,We are just introducing this to our 10 week old. She seems to love it. Especially the mirror. She looks at herself for the whole time she is on the mat... Lots of fun for her!!! Glad we selected it.
3,Poor sound quality,"I purchased this for my 10 week old, and he seems to like it when he is calm. Not a good idea for him when he is upset. But the reason I gave this 3 stars is /c of the sound quality in the stars. I bought new batteries and put them in, and it sounds like the music is dying. Have since switched out the batteries, but the music still appears to be dying. I plan on exchanging this for another mat of the same, and am hoping that mine is just flawed."
2,"Good for the hanging toys, poor music part","We bought this about 3 weeks ago and our baby loved it. He's almost 3 months old. He loves music, but the music part stopped working 2 weeks after be got it. We tried replacing the batteries twice with no success. We're now trying to get a replacement part for it. The hanging toys are still fun for him, but we would have liked the music to have worked more than a couple of weeks."
4,GREAT GYM- MAYBE REMOVE ELEPHANT,I BOUGHT THIS GYM FOR MY DAUGHTER AND AM HAPPY WITH IT. THE MUSIC AND LIGHTS ARE STIMULATING TO HER AS IS THE HANGING TOYS AND MIRROR. AFTER READING THE OTHER REVIEWS I AM REMOVING THE ELEPHANT TO BE SAFE. A GREAT PRODUCT UNDER CLOSE SUPERVISION.
1,Not happy,"My daughter is just about three months old and has really enjoyed playing on this mat so far. However, I am unhappy with the quality and plan on exchanging it for a different brand. The sound and lights feature stopped functioning a few weeks ago, after minimal use. I had planned on contacting Tiny Love to get a replacement insert, but in the meantime one of the arches snapped in two as I was folding the mat to put it away. It resulted in two very sharp pieces and seems like a safety hazard if it can break that easily."
5,Great Gym!!!,"Baby loves it! Keeps him busy/happy for long stretches at a time (at 8wks he was already kicking the rattle at his feet, grabbing for the giraffe's legs and noticing himself in the mirror).Bright/fun colors. Easily wipe-able (haven't washed it yet). Plenty of holes for hanging at various heights (easy to switch out toys).Tips:1) we only use a couple of hanging toys at a time as to not over-stimulate2) occasionally we hang the Tiny Love Clip and Go Mobile to the center of the gym for something that moves/rotates3) since the constant music is a bit tinny and can start to grate, we usually listen to our own MP3's (will be fun when he can activate the flowers and receive a song as a reward)I can see we'll get lots of use from this the next few months - well worth the money."
2,I can't believe I paid 60 bucks for this,"My kid was overwhelmed at first by all the hanging toys and fussed the first few times we put her under them. I stuck my head in there with her, and it does feel a bit claustrophobic because all the animals are all up in your business. I removed some of the lower-hanging creatures, and she seems to like it better.The strangest thing--the nursery rhyme music really creeps me out. It's off-key or flat or something, and it's grating and spooky, just like the Janet Leigh stabbing music from Psycho.The Mozart is a little better, yet the ""10 contiuous minutes"" of music is a just a loop of a 30-second snatch from Sonata for Piano in F. Anything repeated twenty times is irritating, even Mozart.You might think I'm just cracking wise, but I swear to you my daughter's favorite part of this toy is the on/off switch for the lights and music. That keeps her busy for minutes."
1,Not worth it!,"I thought this prduct would be decent quality since I spent a fortune on it and extra Gymini toys to go with it. It faded terribly the first time I washed it. It also shrank ALOT and was hard to get back together. Also, the toys aren't that interesting to babies. I run my own inhome childcare, and all three babies weren't thrilled.The music is LOUD and terrible. It would turn on by itself even when it was turned off. I ended up taking the music and lights part out and throwing it away.Don't waste your money on a piece of junk. Invest in the new Fisher Price Linkadoos playmat. It is wonderful and the extra toys are reasonably priced and the kids LOVE it!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,DOES NOT WORK WITH LINK-A-DOs AND OTHER RINGS,Caveat emptor - this does not work with the standard size of baby toy rings - only the special ones that come with it. We lost a bunch and can't find replacements. :(
5,Well worth the money spent!!,I almost didn't buy this toy because it was a little expensive but I did and don't regret my decision at all. My baby is 3 months old and was starting to get bored just laying on the floor. Now she will lay on the floor for hours watching herself in the mirror or just kicking and talking to her friends (the monkey and the giraffe). My husband and I have just as much fun with her play mat as she does!! Excellent buy.
3,Cool,"My daughter enjoys playing in the gym but only plays in it for about 10 minutes and then she's ready to be picked up. But otherwise its nice, easy to store and you can add your own extra hanging items to the gym for personalization."
5,Baby loves it,My husband thought this was going to be a waste of money - now he's a huge fan. Our 3 month old spends great quality quiet time here entertaining herself with the hanging animals and she has since she was about a month old. The animals are so entertaining to her with great contrasting colors and they're long enough that she can hang onto them. We un-clip them and bring them with us whenever she's in the car seat too.
5,Grandson loves the playmat!,I ordered this item for my grandson and he loves it! It keeps him entertained and he is already turning on his side & pulling up on his belly at 3 months to see everything! My daughter said it is great as it gives her a chance to take a shower or clean house while he is entertained!! A++++
4,Warmly Recommended!,"I had a different mat for my first child. I received this as a gift when my daughter was born. She loves it. Much better than our old mat. Great for tummy time and back. Some negatives: you must lay it on a carpet because the mat is not thick enough to support a tumbing baby's head- but this is true for most mats.Also, it becomes too small when the baby is mobile, and the batteries are consumed rather quickly.We had a problem with the squeeky part on the mat and Tiny Love got back to us quickly with a replacement mat- so great customer care!"
5,Great activity for new baby!,"My daughter has enjoyed her mat since birth. It has been a great place for her to spend her tummy time because she loves looking at the different patterns on the mat; and when she is on her back she enjoys the hanging animals. At first she would just swat at them but now she is grabbing and exploring them. I highly recommend this to parents with an infant. My one complaint is that the lights and music broke after a few months. For such a pricey toy, this was disappointing; however, the main attraction of the toy is not the music (in fact, my husband could not stand it) but the bright colors and toys. My daughter loves it!"
1,"Cheaply made, lights and sound never worked.","Cute to look at, but not well made, and the company is very hard to get any help from. They responded to my problem (lights and sound unit do not work at all) 8 months after my request for help, telling me that they would be happy to replace the part, as long as my purchase date wasn't over 6 months ago. That would have been great news two months ago, but is a waste now. The portable design is a good idea, and the graphics are good, but the lights and sounds are about 50% of why we wanted this, so it's basically just a fancy place mat without them. Waste of money, waste of time trying to contact this company."
2,Not so great,"Based on all the positive reviews, we bought that gym thinking that baby Tilly would love to spend some time on it while practicing some skills. Well, she didn't like it. We tried to leave her there at several occasions (5, 10, 15 min, with us next to her, with us far from her), and most of times, she was crying and crying. It is an expensive gadget which requires a lot of floor space. The bouncer and the saucer were better purchases."
5,our baby loved it from the very first time...,We received the Gymni as a gift. It turned out to be one of our baby's favorite activities. We started her out on the Gymni at 5 or 6 weeks. She loves pulling on the animals. She also likes the various sounds made by the animals and things on the mat. I would highly recommend this for your baby.
1,Beware - Choking Hazard,"My son almost choked on the pink plastic from the bottom of the elephant's stomache. If my father didn't see it in his mouth, he would have choked. So make sure to either get rid of that piece, or supervise when child is playing with the elephant."
5,Great product,"My son is now 8 months old. The gym has been a favourite toy of his since he was only 2 months old. It's amazing to see how one toy can adapt as the child grows and as his motor skills and understanding develop. As he changes, he finds new ways to play with it."
3,Very entertaining but some quality issues,"The good: My 4 month old really enjoys this toy - especially reaching for, pulling on, and kicking at all the animals. It keeps her entertained for a little while when I try to cook, start laundry etc. Nothing is a substitute for play time with Mommy, but Mommies need to get a few things done!The bad: The batteries are very difficult to change. The plastic compartment is made too tight for the standard Duracell AA batteries! It was frustrating. Finally my husband had to wedge the batteries in with great effort.I like being able to wash the mat, but it is a pain to disassemble for washing."
3,tiny love activitot tropic isle better!!!!!!!!,"I was deciding between this one and the tiny love activiot tropic isle one and I bought this one first and took it right back...the arches seem so low and they don't go anywhere they're stuck like that! the tropic isle one you can ""unplug"" the arches and ""plug"" them in to any of the spots around the mat! it's more colorful...brighter anyway. it grows so much better with your child than this one...you should check it out! If that tropic isle one wasn't an option I would then pick this one."
3,Too slow,"There's a lot of good material here, but the book really moves at a glacial pace and seems to slow down even more in the latter half. I was primed to love this but I didn't and I'm not sure I'll investigate Marias any further."
3,Has a few problems,"I've used this light for years because it came with the kit.Ok, one day I really needed it and I set it down and the thing fell over and the bulb broke. I went and put another one in. Of course, since I'm a klutz, I broke the second one and had to finish working in the attic with a bic lighter.One day I turned it on and the light was so bright it was so cool, then it burnt out quicky. What happened? I had put a 14 volt bulb in the thing. Hey, it worked cool for a few minutes.Anyway, seriously, the flexible part needs design work, the light does not stand on its own well and often falls over. The tool itself is indespensable, but if it had a longer neck that was more rigid and a base that was more stable it would work better."
3,Feels cheap,"I will update the products review once I've had a chance to use it, but it does feel a bit cheap"
3,DW919 review,"Not a bad light. I like the versatiliy of it, but it's not very bright as it has a standard flashlight bulb. I don't necessarily recommend it unless you don't need much light"
4,18v light,Product arrived on time with no problems. Emails were appreceiated letting me know the status of my order.
3,"Good light output, not so sturdy","Has good light output. These days you'd think they would go with an LED or offer an LED kit to go easy on the battery.The flexible shaft is a bit too flexible and loses it's position unless time is taken to position and balance it just so. If not, it loses it's balance as the light sags and falls over. The problem is worse with the smaller and lighter batteries like the lithium Ion's."
5,This flashlight is a great buy.,"If you have any Dewalt 18-Volt tools, this is a great flashlight to get. I use it for lots of jobs when I need more light (and as I get older, I need more light to see lots of things. It is a strong light, maybe the LED version is better, but I like this version."
5,Best light I own!,"I got my firstone of these as part of a kit, after using it a few times I bought two more! I operate a small airport and I find them very useful while repairing and inspecting aircraft, I keep one on my fuel truck so I can set it down and light up my work while I'm refueling airplanes. The heavy base and flex shaft make it easy to put light where you want it. This light eliminates the need for a second person (not always one around) to hold a flashlight and frees up both your hands for the task at hand (no pun intended). A great light, and with Amazon's new lower price a great buy!James HatsisJames1@OconeeAirService.com"
2,strong light. awful support,"bought to work on my car in a dark garage. The battery base hardly gets the lamp on it's feet unless you have a long irregular surface. there's one spot on my engine (over the fuse box) where it can stand.even then, the wire that holds the light up does NOT support the weight. i'm always having to leave the cable in a weird position so it does not succumb. it's very frustrating. the reach of the arm is practically zero as i always have to leave the lamp dropped somewhere. it can never be raised on the metal arm.Look at the pictures. see that the ONLY pic with the lamp raised it's almost vertical? that's the ONLY position the arm will hold. deviate one degree and it falls to the floor in slow motion.i'm now using it as an expensive lantern around the house for when the lights goes out."
3,works fine,Works as expected. I like being able to carry it around and being able to hang it around other structures.
5,a lot of light for a cordless,Again my husband loves his dewalt lights. He is alway needing them on the farm late at night when he has to go out to check on the herd.
4,Dewalt worklight,"Great light for under counter, attic or tough to reach areas. The gooseneck extension (18"" +) is a real plus. When battery is in place the light is very stable and not easy to tip over. I already had batteries and charger, so worklight was an inexpensive addition to my combo set. I checked at 'box' stores and couldn't find comparable light for near the price I paid for this item on Amazon. I do handyman/remodeling, and great for inspecting prior to bidding on job. Not something I use everyday, but when I need the light it is worth every penny spent (and then some).Great gift idea as an addition for contractor or avid tool person because it is under $30.00!"
5,Good Buy!,This style of flashlight is not available at the hardware stores any more. My husband liked it as it was snake like and you could get the flashlight into areas and have his hands free while he was working. I was surprised to be able to find the flashlight through Amazon. It didn't have the Dewalt battery but it only cost $30.00. We have Dewalt batteries from buying other Dewalt battery operated power tools. I received this item rather quickly and used it as a Christmas present.
5,Good item,Like this DeWalt item. It may be a little heavy to use as a flashlight to walk around the block with...but that is really not it's intended use now is it. It has great substance and love the flexiblity. Great price too at under 10.00. Already have other DeWalt items to share my recahargable battery with this item. Very pleased.
2,"Disappointed, reflector substandard and discolored quickly","Received this today, and after testing this light by leaving it on for about an hour, the beam developed a multicolored blue band around the edge. This is due to the plastic reflector overheating and becoming discolored. I opened the light up and the plastic had a burnt smell to it. Basically a poor design as the light is unable to handle the amount of light / heat that the bulb produces over a normal period of time. Do not recommend purchase of this unit as the reflector issue ruins what is otherwise a nice light."
2,Not the best light.,"This is a nice light but I would by far choose the regular pivoting DW908. My snake light came apart in one of the sockets about as soon as I got it. I glued it together and it has not failed since, but the other DeWalt light is much nicer for just regular flashlight use and is much more comfortable and balanced to hold or to set down and shine. The snake light is hard to get to stay where you want it, and it easly gets bomped or topples over. The pivoting light you set or lay over and just tilt that head to where you want it to shine and it stays there.Loren G. Martin"
4,Dewalt Light,"I have always used Dewalt and have always been extremely happy with them. They are built to last and the application is extremely well done. It's a great light and would recommended to everybody. I am a builder by trade, so my tools get very extensive use and I always try to provide the best review according to my experience."
4,Good,"We bought this CD because my son loves the ""oh johnny"" song for Narnia. This is a cute CD, with some very old songs that I never heard, but it is enjoyable."
1,Want to save $20 and 5 min? Don't buy it.,It took me about 5 minutes to page through this masterpiece. Nothing there that a casual study of an MSDN example C program would not reveal in greater detail. Absolute waste of time and money.
2,Schumacker SE 1010-2,"I bought this charger online to replace my 40 year old charger that finally quit working. I wanted to keep it simple so I ordered a manual charger with minimal electronics -like my last one- so perhaps it too would also last 40 years.The charger puts out the right voltage and the 12 volt leads are color coded correctly (as per my muli-meter), but the built in ammeter is either defective or wired in wrong. The bigger the load the more the needle pulls off to the left of ""0"" amps. This makes the charger totally useless for battery diagnoses. I am disappointed.I took it upon myself (a day later) to take the charger apart and reverse the leads going to the ammeter. And now the ammeter works. I now give the charger a rating of 4 stars."
4,Its a bulb,"Its a bulb, it worked fine in my dewalt flashlight. Not sure what more can be said about it other then it fit and works fine."
1,Avoid this ripoff - Buy an LED flashlight instead,"Many of you must have noticed that various manufacturers of power tools are ""giving away"" flashlights with cordless drills, etc. Well, this is how they make money, by charging $4-5 for ONE flashlight bulb! What a ripoff. In my experience, these light bulbs are cheaply manufactured and blows out in matter of weeks, not years.I recommend that you search for ""4-LED Flashlight"" on Amazon.com and, for a bit more money, buy one of these LED models for which you NEVER have to replace the bulbs."
4,Mostly lovely,"I adored the books as a child. But the author was English, and I don't think the American voices capture the atmosphere of the books, which resonate of English gardens. I also find that e.g. 'D' is rather saccharine, and I omitted that track when uploading it to my Mac. But then i'm not crazy about untrained children's (singing) voices. Barker's original books managed to avoid being saccharine, which is remarkable really; I think it's because she was such a wonderful artist, so the skill of the paintings ensured them a certain dignity.Anyway, over all it's a charming CD and I have enjoyed e.g. Tina Malia's singing very much. When my toddler is older, I'm sure she'll love it too."
4,Recording Brings Books To Life,"This recording brings an added dimension of sound to the Flower Fairy Alphabet book. It uses simple but lovely melodies and harmonies that can be understood by a child of any age, with a variety of instruments and moods. I suggest that this recording be purchased with the book, so the child can connect the pictures in the book to the sounds on the recording."
3,"Quite Good, But Not For Me","Once again I purchased an album of medieval music unheard, hoping that since the songs were written hundreds of years go I would be listening to a recreation, and once again I was disappointed. Don't get me wrong, this is a great album. My only problem with it is that it is a modern recording of modern choirs singing music that happens to have been written long ago. I enjoy hearing music by composers I'm unfamiliar with, and the material here is worth having. I just didn't plan on hearing modern renditions of that music, with modern polyphany. The songs are very old, but the music is definitely 20th/21st century.It's good, but not what I like hear. My fault, not theirs."
2,Educational. Not entertaining.,"Thinking the 100 tracks this four volume set has to offer would be a relaxing in the car, or underscored during work time, I found the compilation of various composers to be rather jarring. Each CD contains 25 tracks of different movements from 6 to 8 artists, which don't follow any pleasing through line. If you are interested in learning just who composed which famous piece, or if you need to have on hand the top 100 classical pieces (according to whom? I don't know), then this may be right for you. If you are looking for leisure then I suggest you find something that actually completes a symphony."
2,Diappointed,I was disappointed when I received this book( that I had purchased for my Mother in law) because I didn't realize it was used. My fault I guess. I am going to give it to her anyway and hopefully she will enjoy it and not think she has a cheap daughter in law!
4,One tough soldier,I found it hard to focus much of the time because I kept getting distracted by the sound of his clanging brass balls. Written in a very straight forward and matter of fact manner this is a no nonsense book.
4,A Differnt Perspective of World War I,History is written by the victors. What makes Storm of Steel so unique is that this autobiographical account of the Great War was written by one of the losers. It is interesting to read about why this young German soldier fights but also of the respect he has for his opponents on the other side of No Man's Land. Ernst Junger does not shy away from the graphic truth about the horrors of war. Every recollection of battle is filled with descriptions of the grisly deaths of fellow soldiers and the horrid conditions of life in the trenches. This eye opening account of the horrors of war is a must read for any student of history.
3,There's Better Work Out There,"There's better work out there on the subject. The guy was certainly lucky in that he was wounded many, many times. No doubt he was a very tough customer. The book is somewhat strange, and it doesn't hang together too well. It's interesting in what was omitted: he doesn't deal at all with his family except for his brother who also served, where he came from (which would be interesting in seeing how he was molded), his experiences on leave, his thoughts on how the war was handled, or his thoughts on the war itself and Germany's aims. His take on the post war era would be interesting, but that may be part of another book.Overall it's uneven. If you are very interested in the subject matter and want to read it all then definitely read this. Otherwise skip it."
1,Cheap book,"I have the soft cover Penguin Classics edition of Storm of Steel. When I opened the package the cover separated from the spine of the book. I have read to page 12 and pages are already coming apart due to the cheep glue that was used to glue the spine of the book. It is a brand new book. I am not abusing it, it is just falling apart! The story seems fine, but I doubt that I will be able to finish it before the book completely falls apart.This is not a knock on the story, it is a coment on how the book was made."
1,Spare yourself the trouble of gouging out your eyeballs,"This is honestly the worst book I've ever read. If you are an unfortunate soul that is required to read this, I share your sympathy. While I was reading this, I was pulling out my eyebrows.This book is long and not at all catchy. There is hardly a plot. It will freak you out that Junger doesn't show much emotion to the autrocities he writes about..."
5,All wasn't quiet on the western front...,"Ernst Junger's book on his experiences as an enlisted man, and eventually an officer on the Western Front in WWI reminds one of Guy Sajer's classic ""The Forgotten Soldier,"" if more surreal. If you are looking for a recap of Remarque's ""All Quiet on the Western Front"", this is emphatically not it. Junger seems to have thoroughly enjoyed the war, and the camaraderie it brought in the face of mechanized, impersonal destruction. In fact, there is evidence that more veterans agreed with Junger's view than with Remarque's, but I'm not sure what that really means. In any case, definitely worth the read."
4,A Very good Narative of the Great War,"I picked up the book thinking it was about WWII, but I was not disappointed. I too, as another reviewer stated, liked the book ""The Forgotten Soldier"" better which is a WWII book. However I was totally impressed with Ernst Junger. What I liked best about this book was his 'never surrender - never say die' spirit. How a man could go through the living hell which he did and keep such a positive outlook is the most amazing aspect of the whole book. The ONLY drawback about the book is the lack of maps and dates. It's hard to follow where the action is and what year he is talking about. Also, I wish he had spoken a little bit about where he was when Germany surrended. If anyone knows of a website to learn more about Ernst Junger please let me know."
4,Fascinating Memoir and interesting outlook on war,"This book is certainly fascinating, and it's a down and dirty perspective of the war. The way it's written is almost like it's out of a diary or journal. Junger has a somewhat fatalist attitude towards war, loyalty, and sense of duty which seem odd today. I'm not sure if his views were the norm at the time, but I'd like to think so.His matter of fact descriptions of soldiers being blown apart seems emotionless, which is a odd and disturbing to me.His writing is short on background and character development. Also the reason for events happening are not explained very well at times either. Possibly the novel would probably have been excxeedingly long and not flowed as well at it did if this had been done.Junger certainly can be lyrical, and the visual one gets from some of his descriptions are very evocative.This book is different from fictional novels, as it addresses real occurances and actual people.It's worthwhile reading."
5,Timeless Resource,This video is a great resource that demonstrates the process of fitting (but not constructing) pants. Pati covers tissue fitting and pin fitting fabric during construction using herself as a model in a situation where she is fitting herself (showing those of us without a fitting partner how to do it ourselves). She demonstrates a more fitted pant and a looser fitting pant including many common fitting issues.
1,Completely disappointing!,"Pride and Prejudice is my absolute favorite book. Therefore, I read all the sequels to PnP. This one is without a doubt one of the worst if not THE worst. Incidentally, this was the first sequel I had ever read and was so upset after I read it that I was apprehensive to read any others. Thankfully, I have read sequels since that are much better. The author's portrayals of the Darcys and the Bingleys are so off that it is disturbing. It makes me wonder if she even read PnP. Through about two-thirds of the book, it is also incredibly boring. As if she wrote the last third in a hurry, Tennant crams in so much ridiculous nonsense to end the book. Since I can't let myself not finish a book once I start, I was happy when I finally got to the end and the misery was over."
1,Not for Jane Austen fans,"I've never been tempted to throw a book out until I read this one. This book is not just disappointing because it mutilates Jane Austen's characters, it is simply not well written. It seems to me that the author determined she could make a few bucks quick bucks off of Jane Austen fans, or suckers -like me- who are always looking for all-things-Austen."
1,Horrific!,Ugh. To mention this book in the same breath as Pride and Prejudice is utter insult to Jane Austen. It would have helped if the author had actually *read* P&P before this pile of tripe was written. Thank heavens that I have just read that there are better sequels. I must agree with the other reviewers! The mess of the timeline regarding children was particularly awful. This book is not worth the paper on which it is printed.
1,Extremely disappointed!,"This is such a great concert and music this good deserves the best audio formats. I am extremely disappointed that the only audio format on this Blue-ray is stereo. No DTS HD 5.1, Dolby HD 5.1or PCM HD 5.1. I guess it's cheaper to just add the video to the stereo CD. What a waste! Paul Simon should be ashamed to cheapen his work like this!"
2,NO DTS HD MA 5.1 AUDIO OPTION!,"Here's the blurb directly from Paul Simon's official site;""recorded in superb high-definition by director Martyn Atkins along with sterling audio mixed by Phil Ramone and Andy Smith, will be available in three formats: 2-CD/1-DVD special package, Blu-ray and Standard DVD""If it is so sterling then why cheat Blu Ray fans out of a lossless surround option? - a terribly wasted opportunity - great performances, great band, great songs - the stereo only PCM 2.0 24/48 stream belongs on DVD - NOT Blu Ray. A very disappointed Simon fan - what coulda' been..."
5,Paul Simon concert in New York City in 2012.,"This is a very enjoyable concert with great rhythms delivered by a band of very versatile, multi-talented musicians, headed by Paul Simon himself.The only complaint I have is that I was charged more for postage than the DVD actually cost. I was charged in excess of 12 dollars for mailing costs, when the envelope showed a postal charge of 4 dollars and 33cents. Allowing say 1 dollar for an envelope, what was the other 7 plus dollars for?I will be very cautious with any future purchases from Amazon, especially when the product is being supplied from a U.S. supplier."
2,"Great images, standard audio","The images are great (Full HD) but the sound is only 2 channel stereo, not the expected for a Blu ray"
4,OK Car seat,I have had my son in this car seat since he was 5 months old. He is now a year old and has it in the forward facing position. This car seat is impossible to adjust the straps in the rear facing position. This seat is very cusioned and seems to be comfortable. I do wish that it was easier to adjust the straps. I am currently in the market to buy a spare car seat for his father's car and I do not plan on getting this one. I want one that is simple to adjust. This car seat can also be a pain to install. I bought it because it had such high safety ratings. I wish I would have done more research before I purchased however. If I would have know it was going to be such a pain I would not have bought it.
3,Groove Corporation - Dub Plates From The Elephant House: Volume One,"Some dubbalicious rhythms from the Groove Corporation. The layering of sound on DUB PLATES FROM THE ELEPHANT HOUSE, VOL. 1 is dense and thick, full of reverb. The chorus on ""Breakin Up is Hard to Do,"" for example, helps lift the track into something almost spiritual. The computer manifesto of equality on ""Dub 3000"" manages to be funky and slighyl off-putting. The aggressive breaks on ""Teach Them"" inject a bit of velocity and excitement into the album. Similarly, ""Red Sea"" speeds up the surroundings in a moody, atmospheric desert. The interlude ""Byte #2"" has a calm guitar that's reprised in ""Worst Dressed Chicken."" Perfectly suited for all your dub needs."
2,Strong Torque but Messy,"I bought the Porter Cable to replace an older Milwaukee, it had better torque than the old Milwaukee but after tightening 25 to 30 lag screws it became so hot you couldn't touch the front of the tool, and the front bearing began to leak grease all over the place. This was a major problem as i was lag bolting together a log home and the grease was getting all over the logs."
1,the first pc tool i HATED,"i have owned (and still own) probably 85% of the p/c line of tools and this is the first one i have truely been disapointed in. i expeienced the same problems as the previous writers, with the tool heating up to the point where it is painfully hot, and the lubrication dripping down from the tool. i returned it the second day i owned it and purchased a competing brand and couldnt be happier. p/c really dropped the ball on this one."
1,don't,Do not waste your time or money on this tool... you will only return it after being thoroughly disappointed. A cheap cresent wrench will outperform this impact tool!
2,"The Seller is Great, but the product not so much",I actually wanted to try this product to compare it to a competitor's product for carb reduction. I really can not find anything outstanding to say about this product.. Sorry.
4,Seems to be working.,The only issues I have with this is that I forget to remember to eat it 10 minutes before I eat. But I have lost 2 pounds so far. I usually stay at the same rate of weight so I am happy with the 2 pounds in a month so far.
4,Truly A Dynasty,"Kitty Kelley's book The Family shows us in approximately 600 pages how the Bushes and Walkers came to dominate American politics and business. She unearths the meanness and hypocrisy that are really what the Bush administration is all about. After reading her book it is clear that the only thing that matters to the Bushes and their ""friends"" is money, power, and winning. All of these are done at any cost. As long as they can keep their flow of millions of dollars going it doesn't matter to them that others have to die and suffer for their ""wins"".A must-read if you are interested in how power and arrogance have torn this country apart and caused many to suffer."
4,Interesting enough!,"What an interesting book to behold. It brings both Presidents down to common folk with real-life problems and some rich-only problems that are quite surprising. It's not sided, because they've been proven to be fact (in which some are available to civilians). It comes down to you, the reader. If you're interested in the family, for or against them, it's interesting. And if you choose to, you could learn a thing or too from the book."
5,"A real eye popper, Kitty!","Thank you Kitty for providing such in-depth and eye popping insight into the goofs 'n' guffaws of the Bush family!Whew! It's dizzying to believe that the portrait you drew of these folks is in such sharp contrast to what we see in public. You scare (and shock) a lot of us who put credence in the president's leadership and what this man is doing with our sons and daughters abroad. You make me ask over and over again, ""Is this man really running our country?! Oh my gosh! What have we done? Are we consious?! Am I dreaming?""Even if what you say in the book is only half right, it makes me take pause... take a step back if you will... and say ""no"" to another term in the Whitehouse. At least for the time being until much of what you say can be sorted out! I say all of this, even though your timing is a bit suspect.For goodness sakes Kitty! You make him look like a goof ball! Was that your intent at this particular point in time?"
4,Surprise,"This book was a lot better than I thought it would be. I figured it would be another Bush trashing book. But it's really not. It starts back with Samuel Bush who is 43's great grandfather and shows you how the Bushes came about on both sides of the family. It talks about Sen. Prescott Bush's failures and his successes in detail. I enjoyed how Barbara and George met, fell in lust and then continued to be married. She talks about 41's affair with Jennifer Fitzgerald, but does it with suspicion on her part saying that there were a lot of concidences but nothing proven. She then brings you up on the present day family of 43's and their problems. I really thought Kelley presented both sides of things. There is a slant against the Bushes but it's minor. Good book that shows the progress of the family. Good citations."
2,Book!,Not very well written! Not a very good book! But then again I don't like the Bush family either! A total waste of money!
4,behind the bush,"Interesting tale about the bush family, a bit of history without the boredom of a dull, slow moving school book variety. american istory"
1,Now I'll Vote for President Bush....,"Like many Americans I was curious about the ""scoop"" on the Bush family, but after reading this book, I feel ashamed. Never again will I feed off the gossip about other people. This book taught me how disgraceful we are to want to read unsubstantiated stories about our president, (and any other person for that matter)."
1,She is a liar,"I am so offended by this book, she is lying and cannot back up her sources. She is so lying in this book. In her previous books she was at least somewhat believeable but now she has lost her mind and is just selling books to get a buck. I bleieve anyone who buys this book should really think about giving money to the Red Cross or the March of Dimes before they buy this trash. She needs help, and its not monetary. She has no on the record testamony and has only used second hand information. Even Chris Matthews who does not like Bush has torn Kitty Kelley apart. Please save your money America! We work too hard for it."
1,Save your money and buy a cheap tabloid instead,This is just candy for the brain. If you are the kind of person who likes to read trash irregardless of whether it is true or not then go to your local supermarket and buy a cheap tabloid. You'll get the same result and it will cost you less.
1,Aimed straight at the tabloid junkies,"If you enjoy and belive those junky tabloids that are sold in supermarkets or watch soap operas or believe that pro wrestling is not fake, then you will LOVE this book.Interesting that Amazon took their time getting reviews for Unfit For Command BUT....How quickly they provided a review board for this junk.Fortunately intelligent people already know all about Kitty Kelly and this will only backfire on the democrats just like that 60 minutes nonsense. Remember this is the same person who wrote that garbage about Pres. Ronald Reagan and the former First Lady Nancy Reagan and others. Kitty Kelly has no credibility among intelligent people!Thank you Kitty Kelly for gaining even more votes for George W. Bush and perhaps for putting the final nail in Kerry's coffin."
1,Waste of money and waste of time,"Not sure what is worse - the money I wasted to buy this book or the hours I wasted reading it. Should have known after the Royals what type of writer Kitty Kelly is.For those who haven't read a book by her - don't bother. They all follow the same formula for a cheap tawdry romance novel book - who had sex with whom (adultry), who was drugs, who had an abortion etc. etc. And to add insult to this mindless trash - there are no first person accounts to what she claims is the truth. Just her opinion what might have happen. Funny how all her books follow the same threads. Doesn't matter if she is writing about Frank Sinantra, the Royal Family of England or the Bush family - it's the same story.So if you like fiction (which is what this is) and get a thrill from slander - go ahead and buy the book. If like me, you've grown up, and have ready read a book or two by Kitty Kelly - you get skip this one. It's the same slash job she does in all her novels."
1,The Real Story????,"I was in the bookstore yesterday and bought the current #1 best seller. I also browsed this book. I have always been cautious about books like this especially about high profile people during election years and usually dismiss them as ""smear tactics.""After looking at this book and based on the comments by the people around me (none of whom bought this book) I decided that this book was nothing even close to The Real Story but just a cheap attempt to attack our commander-in-chief by a writer who I was told has zero credibility. So do the paid shills constantly reposting 5 star reviews for this junk!Looking for The Real Story? Then look elsewhere."
1,TABLOID TRASH!,"This book is only good for lighting my fireplace! It is total trash! If you want to get your tabloid fix, then go to your local supermarket and get the rags that are there. This author is discusting! Show your intellect and don't waste your money on this trash.And by the way, for the reviewer who said that the tabloids are from the right-wing... well, just as I think this book is trash, I think the supermarket tabloids are trash as well. I do NOT read tabloids from the supermarket, as I believe that TRASH IS TRASH. It does not matter whether the trash has a hard cover or paper cover, it is still trash. I will not pollute my mind with this garbage! Kitty Kelley should be ashamed of herself!"
1,Scurrilous,"Comprised only of personal attacks and accusations without naming credible sources or providing substantiated footnotes and references. A blatant attack on the character and integrity of a U.S. President and his wife should be extremely well documented, not the created from personal bias, hatred, fiction, rumors, and urban legends. I think Ms. Kelley has forgotten (or never learned) that scholarship is based on fact and in-depth research. This book never approaches scholarship - it's not even Jerry Springer. If she insists on prostituting herself to the Democratic Party, let's at least hope she's wearing lots of makeup and fishnet stockings. A waste of time to open the covers."
1,Fantasyland,"700 pages of unsubstantuated garbage. If you like comic books, you'll love this. Whatever your political bent, skip this fictional work."
1,TRASH< TRASH< TRASH<,"Anyone who believes one iota of what this woman writes has to have their head examined. The only thing she is interested in is selling books. Buy the SOLELY book for entertainment value, not as a reference tool or a talking point in an argument with right winger!"
1,Are You Kidding Me?,"No one's perfect, not one of us. I don't imagine Kitty Kelley would like her dirty laundry exposed and of course, embellished. I don't believe half of what's written because it's based on rumor, but even if parts were true, like George H.W. Bush's affair with Ms. Fitzgerald, only a vile and vindictive person would purposely expose Barbara to this. And yes, I was far too curious but now I'm sorry for it."
1,A WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY,"THIS BOOK IS A PACK OF HE SAID SHE SAID LIES, NOT ONE PERSON IN THE BOOK WILL COME FORTH TO ADMIT WHAT THEY TOLD KITTY IS TRUE. THIS IS A BOOK OF RUMORS. CHRIS MATTHEWS RIPPED HER APART ON TV WITH NO PROOF ON ANYTHING WRITTEN IN THIS BOOK. QUICK MONEY FOR KITTY!"
1,The Real Story of the Bush Dynasty,"What a bunch of suckers!!! All Kitty Kelley is interested in making a bunch of money, why else did she publish it as this time. She does not care about the truth, her book is gossip, pure gossip. If you take to heart her book as the truth I guess you are as dumb as she is counting on you being."
1,WHAT???,"I shouldn't have read this book. The info does stick with me, but I don't see it as truth, but fiction, like a good story should be."
1,This is proof that trash sells!,"Want to make a lot of money? Want to get a book to make the best seller lists? Just write trash like this new book by the Queen of trash. I well remember the trash that she wrote about fmr Pres. Ronald Reagan and fmr First Lady Nancy Reagan. Clearly Kitty Kelley has no moral boundries and only writes to make money. Of course, I am presupposing that you have no ethics, no conscience and no moral background...just like Kitty.If that is the case, you will love this book. For those of us who do have a moral conscience, skip this one and buy it for a few pennies when it shows up in the used book stores as early as next month. Obviously this book is not doing that well and I predict will die out fast. Check back and see forself. Check the used book stores."
1,Downout lies from an American Idiot,"Kitty Kelley is the biggest moron I have ever seen. I cant believe anyone would believe this B.S., if you want the truth read ""Unfit for Command"""
1,Loopy Leftist Lies,If you believe that Dan Rather's forged documents are real then this is the perfect book for you. You are all deluding yourselves that the DNC along with Kitty Kelley are telling the truth. Wake up and realize you are just being duped for your vote or for your money.
1,Phoney,"After seeing an interview with her on the Today show, I can't believe that anyone would buy her books. I think she's a fake and it seemed that all her 'informants' never actually told her what they said they did. She never answered the questions posed to her directly, she diverted because she knows what she's written isn't 100% true at all. If you want faulse information, buy it, if you want fact, stay clear of her."
1,Amazon: Kelley's Credibility Far Exceeds Swift Boat Vets,"No one can say that Amazon has caved in and practiced the radical approach of consistency. User review restrictions apply to all books critical of Bush, regardless of credibility, but books against Kerry can be cherry picked by Amazon for special treatment in user reviews."
1,Only a Moron would actually believe this dribble!,"This book is a shameful waste of trees!!! I really couldn't stomach getting through this garbage! The only positive thought I have about this book is that I didn't spend one cent of own money!! How someone can write such trash about our President is way beyond what is considered just plain decency!! Like ""Memogate"", this author has totally lost any credentials she ever had or will have!"
3,"Tough, repetitive read but it explains the nature of #43.","Hard to tell fact from fiction on several topics in this book but many a classmate of George W. is going officially on record identifying the 43rd president as a boorish, illiterate, drunkard bully devoid of any grace or intellectual curiosity.Bush supporters will claim it is all lies but these are specific statements, attributed to specific people who are still very much in the public eye.The book is tough to read with all the time jumping repetitions and could be significantly condensed and improved by leaving out the less important trivia."
1,Terrible Book,While on vacation I decided to read this terrible book. I only got through 550 pages before I decided to throw the book away least someone else think this book is accurate and hiostoric.This is one of the worst books I ever read. You would think the Bushes did nothing right in there lives. The book is completely negative and who know how accurate it is. The author is completely bias.DO NOT READ THIS GARBAGE.
3,"No opinion, really...","...as I haven't read the book, which makes me all the more impressed I was that Mr./Ms. D. Duntley, who has read it, was able to read the entire 700-page thing while standing in a bookstore, on the day it was released, by 11:30AM EDT (or 10:30 local Tulsa time), on a work day, then write a review. Way to go Duntley!"
5,A MUST READ FOR ALL TRUE AMERICANS,"If you consider yourself a true american, a patriot, a true christian. You must read this book. Kitty Kelly is a hero. She has shown America and the World the reality of the Bush Family, and George W himself. We have been sold a bill of goods. They have been portrayed as the Cleavers and they are really the Sopranos. They are dirty.George W was AWOL from the Guard, a cocaine addict, and a hell raiser. He has the IQ of a carrot. It also shows how the Bush family is bed with the Saudis. Our nation is at risk by what they have done. I have heard a lot of people criticize Kitty Kelley, but NOBODY is refuting the facts in her book. This book is a must read. It shows the true colors of George W. Bush, and shows why he must not remain our Puppet President"
1,Just another Slime,Nearly all of her sources are annonomous. How in the world can a publishing house possibly publish this hit piece.
